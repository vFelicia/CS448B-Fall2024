00:02 - YouTube clone using flutter UI kit
00:04 - Firebase as a backend and River pod for
00:07 - State Management this tutorial covers
00:10 - everything from Google signin
00:12 - authentication to uploading and
00:14 - displaying videos profile customization
00:17 - and much more designed for beginners it
00:19 - will guide you through Firebase and
00:21 - River pod from scratch but a basic
00:24 - understanding of flutter and dart is
00:26 - recommended am Min from code HQ created
00:29 - this course let's start an amazing
00:31 - journey of creating the fully stck
00:33 - YouTube clone with tons of great
00:34 - features and a beautiful UI this
00:36 - tutorial is designed to make you master
00:38 - not only flutter but also Firebase and
00:40 - reward po 2.5 if you are an absolute
00:42 - beginner don't worry as I go through
00:44 - Concepts step by step and will cover
00:46 - different Technologies to complete this
00:48 - app we'll start off by signing user with
00:50 - Google and collecting users data for
00:52 - creating username we will check the fire
00:54 - database in real time to see if username
00:56 - is not repeated and if it was show an
00:58 - error to say username is already already
01:00 - taken inside the homepage we can see all
01:02 - the videos uploaded from different
01:03 - channels users can upload their own
01:05 - videos in title description and select
01:08 - the thumbnail manually when video is
01:10 - uploaded by clicking it we are navigated
01:12 - on the actual video page which has
01:14 - exactly the same yoi as the YouTube in
01:15 - your phone I can play the video and move
01:18 - it back or forward we can also like the
01:20 - video see number of viewers And
01:22 - subscribe to their Channel I can add
01:24 - comment to the video and the first
01:25 - comment will be displayed under the
01:27 - video similar to the actual YouTube also
01:29 - while opening a video I can see all the
01:31 - other suggested videos under it next it
01:33 - also has a powerful search engine and I
01:35 - can filter videos and channels at the
01:37 - same time and I can open any channel or
01:40 - video by clicking on it I have my
01:42 - personal Channel with all my information
01:44 - and videos I have uploaded also a
01:46 - channel settings page which allow me to
01:47 - customize the channel profile beside
01:49 - long videos I'm also able to upload
01:51 - short videos edit the video and Export
01:54 - it this course is for beginners and to
01:56 - get it started you don't need any
01:58 - knowledge of Firebase or river poot you
02:00 - just need to have a basic understanding
02:01 - of flut and dart by the end of tutorial
02:04 - you will be familiar with most of
02:05 - Firebase features like authentication
02:07 - signing methods database storage and a
02:09 - lot of useful methods and classes you
02:11 - will also learn different rivert
02:13 - concepts and providers to manage a state
02:15 - inside flut projects so if you're ready
02:18 - let's get it started the first thing
02:20 - that I need to do is to create my
02:22 - Firebase project and I'm going to just
02:23 - do it using the flut fire CLI and it is
02:26 - really a great way to create your fire
02:28 - project which is really easy
02:30 - so let's just open the CMD and here I'm
02:33 - going to just uh use the flut fi uh CLI
02:37 - to create my fireb project before
02:40 - starting make sure that new Js is
02:41 - installed in your computer and if it is
02:43 - done just run this command which it will
02:45 - install fireb tools inside your computer
02:48 - it will take a while and then fireb will
02:50 - be
02:51 - installed very well now fireb should be
02:54 - installed in my computer and I can just
02:55 - check it using the Firebase D Dash
02:59 - version
03:00 - using this command you can just check if
03:01 - FL uh if Firebase is installed in your
03:04 - computer and as you can see this is the
03:05 - current version of my Firebase is and it
03:08 - is a result now I want to just go and
03:11 - open my project so I can just use
03:14 - this command to go inside my YouTube
03:17 - clone project and here the next thing
03:20 - that I need to do is to sign in with my
03:22 - Firebase account so I'm going to just
03:24 - use the Firebase login command which it
03:27 - will go
03:28 - and uh
03:31 - enable me to log in with my current
03:33 - account I'm already logged in with this
03:35 - account but I'm not going to continue
03:37 - with this because I want to log in with
03:39 - another account so I can just use the
03:41 - Firebase log
03:43 - out and using this command I can just
03:46 - log out from my current account and I
03:49 - want to log in with another account so I
03:51 - will run the command Firebase login once
03:55 - again now I hit yes and now it will open
03:59 - the chome for me which allow me to use
04:02 - any account I want to sign in
04:06 - with I have two account I want to use my
04:09 - second account and I will sign in with
04:11 - this
04:11 - one just hit the
04:21 - continue and now all
04:24 - it very well now we are signed it with
04:27 - my fire account very well and as you can
04:30 - see it is also logged in here the next
04:32 - comment that I need to use is this one
04:34 - which it will just go and activate Fifi
04:37 - CLI inside my project so I'm going to
04:39 - just run it it won't take long and
04:42 - fifier CLI will be activated and now as
04:44 - a last step you need to configure your
04:47 - Fifi so I'm going to just run the
04:49 - command Fifi configure and it will just
04:52 - go ahead and fish all the available fire
04:54 - projects that I have and as you can see
04:56 - I have not any project and I I can just
05:00 - go and create a new Fus
05:03 - project the name of the Fus project that
05:05 - I'm going to use is YouTube am Min
05:09 - ahmed2 so I'm going to use this uh name
05:13 - or ID for my fibus project also keep in
05:15 - mind that your Fus project should not be
05:17 - already taken and if it is taken you
05:19 - will not be able to create a f uh you
05:22 - will not be able to create your fireb
05:24 - project so keep this in mind and hit
05:27 - enter now it's creating my fibus
05:37 - project we are having some error so let
05:40 - me run this command once again flut fire
05:45 - configure let's see if we can create our
05:48 - Fus project right
05:53 - now let's give a name to our fibers
05:56 - project I'm going to give it a name
05:58 - YouTube Ahmed
06:01 - amini
06:03 - clone let's hit enter and now it's
06:05 - trying to create my fbas
06:11 - project and again we are getting some
06:14 - error let me just try to create my
06:17 - Firebase project from the console it is
06:18 - also available for me I'm going to just
06:21 - open firebase.com and let's see if we
06:24 - can create a project right
06:27 - here I'm going to change my account to
06:30 - the second one and I want to create my
06:33 - Firebase project here let's see if we
06:36 - can create our project from the console
06:38 - hit on the create
06:40 - project and I'm going to just uh call it
06:44 - YouTube
06:46 - Ahmed
06:51 - amini yeah I can just create this
06:54 - project and hit
06:56 - continue make sure to uh not check this
07:00 - enable Google analytics for this project
07:03 - and then head to create your first Prest
07:06 - project now it's trying to create my
07:09 - project so let's wait for
07:11 - it oh very well after some problems and
07:14 - errors now finally I can create my
07:15 - Firebase project and it is created so
07:18 - let's hit continue and now I have my
07:21 - Firebase project so now let's get back
07:24 - here and I'm going to run the command
07:26 - flutter fire configure once again and
07:29 - and now it's stying to fish my fireb
07:31 - project and I should have one Firebase
07:32 - projects already so let's just find that
07:35 - project and as you can see yeah I have
07:37 - the project uh the name is YouTu clone
07:40 - and I'm going to just hit enter the next
07:42 - thing you can do is to you can choose
07:45 - which platforms you want to configure
07:48 - and I'm going to just do it for Android
07:50 - and iOS so just hit the space button to
07:54 - deselect Mac OS and Vib and hit enter
07:58 - now it's fetching my configuration for
08:01 - Android and when it is done it will also
08:03 - do it for iOS so let's wait for it till
08:06 - all the config uh all the configurations
08:08 - are
08:13 - done very well finally hit yes and now
08:16 - my fibus project is created and
08:17 - everything is done so let's just open
08:20 - the project uh I can also show you that
08:24 - Google services. Json file is
08:25 - automatically generated for me and also
08:29 - I have a file called Firebase options
08:31 - with all the config uh all the
08:33 - configurations related to Firebase is
08:35 - generated inside this file and
08:37 - everything is done for us
08:39 - automatically now let's just finish our
08:42 - configurations before starting you need
08:44 - to make sure that you have all the
08:47 - Firebase packages installed inside your
08:49 - PML file so I'm going to tell you once
08:51 - again that it's highly recommended that
08:54 - you download the starting project from
08:56 - my GitHub which is the link in the
08:57 - description below and if you download it
08:59 - you can access to all this Firebase
09:01 - projects and everything in the starting
09:03 - project so make sure to do it if you
09:06 - download the starting project you will
09:07 - have all this but if not you have to
09:09 - install this packages Firebase out
09:11 - Firebase core Firebase storage and all
09:14 - other packages uh these are related to
09:16 - the Firebase and also you need to
09:19 - install the package Google sign in which
09:21 - we use it to sign with
09:23 - Google which is the package right here
09:27 - very
09:27 - well as a last step I need to initialize
09:31 - my Firebase inside men Dart I just need
09:34 - to add some lines of cut
09:36 - here yeah just add here and now I need
09:40 - to import Firebase code and also I need
09:42 - to import the Firebase options file
09:45 - inside my
09:47 - project also uh because we are using FL
09:51 - River Po in this tutorial I need
09:53 - to wrap my app here
09:57 - with provider scope because we are going
10:00 - to need it I'm going to just use
10:02 - provider SC here and the child will be
10:04 - my app and now I will be able to use FL
10:06 - rivp inside my
10:09 - project everything is done and I have
10:11 - it's
10:14 - working just run the emulator
10:35 - very well now the emulator is run and as
10:37 - you can see we are seeing only a black
10:39 - screen because we have nothing in our
10:41 - men Dart and we are only placing a
10:44 - container and now I'm going to just
10:46 - create my login page and there I can
10:49 - just create all the logic and UI related
10:51 - to the signing user with Google so let's
10:54 - work on
10:57 - it first of all I need to create a a
11:00 - folder called a and inside this folder I
11:03 - can just uh create all the stuff related
11:07 - to signing the user with Google and
11:10 - first of all I'm going to create a file
11:12 - called login
11:16 - page just import the material.
11:20 - dart and create an inad this widget I'm
11:24 - going to call it login
11:26 - page and here let's
11:30 - return and
11:31 - scaffold and we'll create everything
11:34 - here just take the login page and put it
11:36 - inside this instead of this container
11:39 - and import the login page now as you can
11:43 - see we are seeing this
11:47 - screen so let's work on the UI I will
11:50 - also minimize this page that I can see
11:52 - my emulator
12:03 - first of all I will work on the UI of
12:05 - this page and then I will create the
12:07 - logic and functionality to sign in user
12:10 - with
12:11 - Google first let me give it a background
12:14 - color and I will use for now only a
12:16 - background of gray later on I can change
12:20 - this next I can just go inside the body
12:23 - and I can create a safe
12:25 - area the child will be just a center
12:27 - widget and again child will be a
12:37 - column very
12:39 - good so the first thing that I'm going
12:41 - to create inside this column will be an
12:43 - image and I just want to show a YouTube
12:46 - logo image inside this column and I
12:50 - should also tell you that inside this
12:52 - accet folder I have all icons and also
12:56 - images that I will use throughout this
12:58 - project so I'm going to say once again
13:00 - that please download the starting
13:01 - project which you will access all these
13:04 - assets and everything inside this
13:06 - project and I'm going to use a lot of uh
13:09 - these images throughout this project and
13:11 - the first one will be just uh YouTube
13:14 - logo so I'm going to just create an
13:17 - asset
13:19 - image and the image first of all I need
13:22 - to mention the assets then images and
13:25 - then the image that I'm going to use
13:27 - here is an image called YouTube Das
13:30 - signin
13:36 - jpack very good and as you can see this
13:39 - is the logo I'm going to also change the
13:41 - height and I will give it a height of
13:52 - 150 let me also remove this background
13:55 - color I think the original white
13:57 - background color is the best for this
14:00 - also I'm going to give it a padding and
14:02 - also some more style let's wrap it with
14:05 - a padding
14:07 - widget and I will just give it a padding
14:09 - only from the top and also a padding of
14:12 - 25 from the
14:18 - bottom a padding of 20 from the top and
14:21 - also a pading of 25 from the
14:27 - bottom very well now it looks very nice
14:31 - next I will also create a text which
14:33 - inside this text I'm going to just say
14:35 - welcome to
14:39 - YouTube let's also change the text style
14:42 - of this text and I'm going to give it a
14:45 - pH size of 30 and also a pH way of bold
15:01 - and I uh and also I'm going to change
15:04 - the color and I will give it a color of
15:06 - blue
15:10 - gray now I think it looks much
15:15 - better the next I'm going to just give
15:18 - it a
15:19 - spacer and the final thing that I'm
15:22 - going to add here is going to be a
15:23 - button so at the end of this page right
15:26 - here I want to add a button in which the
15:28 - user will be able to sign in with Google
15:30 - whenever the user Taps on a button and
15:33 - for doing it I'm going to just use an
15:35 - image that I have already in my assets
15:38 - folder so let's again uh use the image.
15:42 - assets and again first of all I need to
15:45 - mention the assets then images and the
15:47 - name of the image that we are using here
15:49 - is sign in with
15:53 - google.png sign in with
15:55 - google.png this is the image that you're
15:58 - using here and as you can see this is
16:00 - the exact image let's just change the
16:02 - height and I'm going to just give it a
16:03 - height of
16:07 - 60 I'm going to also wrap it with a
16:17 - padding and I'm going to just give it a
16:19 - padding only from the bottom and a
16:21 - padding of
16:25 - 55 very nice I think it looks very nice
16:29 - the last step that I need to do is to
16:31 - wrap uh this assd image with a just
16:33 - sctor because I want the user to be able
16:36 - to click on this button and when they
16:38 - click it I uh they should be able to
16:41 - sign with Google let's just wrap it with
16:43 - the gure
16:45 - detector and it has an an property which
16:47 - it will be empty for now later on I will
16:50 - add the logic and
16:51 - functionality so that's it uh the UI of
16:54 - this login page is created now we can
16:57 - just go and create the function to sign
16:59 - in with
17:01 - Google let me just create a folder which
17:04 - I'm going to call it
17:07 - repository and another folder which I
17:09 - will call it pages I will move the login
17:12 - page inside the pages I'm going to just
17:14 - do it to make our code more readable and
17:18 - maintainable later on we can read our
17:20 - code much easier in this way and inside
17:23 - the repository I'm going to create a
17:24 - file called OD
17:26 - service and inside this service I can
17:29 - create all the uh logic related to
17:32 - letting user sign in with Google so
17:34 - everything will be here and our code
17:36 - will be much readable and
17:40 - maintainable let's create a class called
17:42 - OD
17:46 - service and here first of all I want to
17:49 - Define two fils one will be Firebase o
17:52 - and the next one will be Google sign in
17:54 - and we need both of them to make user
17:56 - sign in with Google so let's just SC
17:59 - them the first one will be Firebase ALS
18:02 - I need to import
18:04 - it let me import this first I'm going to
18:08 - import Firebase
18:11 - out and I'm going to also import Google
18:14 - sign
18:21 - in now I can just create an inance of
18:23 - Firebase art which I'm going to just
18:24 - call it us and I'm also going to create
18:27 - an in sense of Google sign in which I'm
18:29 - going to just call it Google sign
18:35 - in very well I also generate Constructor
18:39 - for it and it is done so let's work on
18:43 - the logic how can we let user sign in
18:45 - with Google let me just create a method
18:48 - which I'm going to just call it sign in
18:51 - with Google it is an a synr method and I
18:54 - can just use the inocence of Google sign
18:56 - in which I just created and the first
18:59 - method that I create here or I should
19:01 - say the first method I'm going to use
19:02 - here is a method called sign in and what
19:06 - does this method does it will just pop
19:07 - up a window which all user to choose its
19:10 - Google account from all the Google
19:12 - accounts that the user
19:14 - has so I can just uh save the result of
19:18 - this method inside the variable which
19:20 - I'm going to just call it user very well
19:23 - now I can use the user and I'm going to
19:26 - just call the method authenticate
19:30 - of course first of all I need to make it
19:31 - await because we don't know when the
19:33 - user will choose its account and once
19:35 - you await it now I can use the method
19:37 - authentication and doing that user will
19:40 - be signed
19:42 - in now I will just put it inside a
19:45 - variable called Google
19:46 - ass very
19:49 - well the next thing that I want to do is
19:51 - to create a credential and I can just
19:54 - use the Google OD
19:56 - provider and then you use this
19:59 - credential using this I can create my
20:02 - credential and as you can see we have
20:03 - two properties here the first one is
20:06 - access token and the next one is ID
20:08 - token and we can just uh and we can just
20:10 - initialize this access token and ID
20:12 - token using this Google art that we
20:15 - already created I can just uh use Google
20:18 - art and then call Access
20:21 - token Google art
20:24 - do access token let's see what's wrong
20:27 - here
20:32 - yeah I forgot to make this method await
20:34 - as well because we need to await this
20:36 - method as well and now it's working for
20:39 - the ID token I also need to use this
20:41 - google. ID token and now it's working I
20:45 - will just save this credential inside a
20:48 - variable called
20:53 - credential and the last step that I need
20:55 - to do is to connect my Firebase art with
20:57 - Google signning so everything I did up
20:59 - to now was signing with Google but it
21:02 - has nothing to do with fireus off but
21:04 - that is not what we want we also wanted
21:06 - to connect with fireb art so as you can
21:09 - see we have this in a sense of o fireb o
21:12 - I'm going to just use it and then I have
21:14 - a method called sign in with credential
21:17 - and what I want to provide is this
21:19 - credential which the spelling is wrong
21:21 - let me just correct it
21:27 - credential and now it is done I can also
21:30 - await this
21:32 - method and now it is done and we can
21:35 - just sign in with Google using this
21:38 - method so right now it is done the last
21:41 - question is that how can we use this
21:44 - method the asset management solution
21:46 - that I'm going to use throughout this
21:48 - project as I said before will be FL
21:50 - River poot and using this Asset
21:51 - Management solution I will handle the
21:54 - state in my site my project which in
21:56 - this case it is a user so I can just
21:59 - handle this user and access it
22:01 - throughout my project using the FL rpod
22:04 - if you're already familiar with State
22:05 - Management Solutions and specifically
22:07 - flut R po you know why do we need to use
22:10 - it but if you are not familiar with it
22:12 - don't worry as I'm going to explain
22:14 - everything related to flut R pot
22:16 - throughout this
22:18 - project so let me just import FL R pot
22:22 - here let me also tell you that you need
22:25 - to install the package which is already
22:27 - inside my pp.
22:29 - file uh this is the package you need to
22:31 - install this package and once you uh
22:33 - install it you can just import it right
22:35 - here and the way that flod works is that
22:39 - it has a lot of providers and the most
22:41 - important uh ones and famous ones that
22:44 - we are going to use a lot throughout
22:45 - this project will be the simple provider
22:48 - stream provider and especially future
22:51 - provider I'm going to use a lot this
22:53 - kind of providers and you will
22:54 - understand how I'm going to use it just
22:56 - follow along and you will understand how
22:58 - can I use it first I'm going to just
23:01 - create my first provider which I'm going
23:04 - to just call it OD
23:06 - service
23:10 - provider and I'm going to just use the
23:13 - simple provider and as you can see when
23:16 - I create this provider I access to a
23:18 - riff and this riff is just some magic
23:20 - stuff from FL part which allow us to do
23:24 - a lot of things especially we can
23:26 - connect our providers together so use
23:28 - this RI later on I can create consumer
23:30 - widget and then I can connect and access
23:33 - to this provider and I will return
23:35 - return it this class at service you will
23:37 - understand what I mean if you can't
23:39 - understand what I mean don't worry when
23:41 - I do it you will understand how does it
23:43 - work so what I'm going to return is this
23:46 - class odd
23:49 - service and we have two fills to
23:52 - initialize the first one is a which I'm
23:54 - going to just give it firebase.
23:57 - innocense and also the second one is
23:58 - Google signin which I just need to give
24:00 - it an in a sense of Google sign in and
24:04 - now the errors are gone very
24:09 - well let me also do like this that we
24:13 - can see the full screen so I just
24:15 - created my first uh provider which is OD
24:18 - service provider and now I can use it
24:21 - to handle the set which in this case it
24:23 - is a user so let's get back to the login
24:26 - page so you saw how I created the
24:30 - provider but now what you need to know
24:32 - is how can we use this provider inside
24:35 - our UI page which in this case it's a
24:37 - login
24:39 - page the way that FL workot works is
24:42 - that you need to create a consumer wiget
24:44 - and using this magic consumer Viet you
24:47 - can access to your all uh providers and
24:50 - states that you have in your FL r pod
24:53 - and inside your project so there are two
24:56 - ways that you can create consumer widget
24:58 - I I can just change the whole stess
25:00 - widget or also stateful widget to a
25:02 - consumer widget or I can just create a
25:05 - consumer widget in a specific part of my
25:08 - my file so I can just create a consumer
25:10 - widget as a widget or I can just change
25:12 - the whole status widget into a consumer
25:14 - widget so I'm going to show you both how
25:17 - can you do it but the first thing that
25:18 - I'm going to do is to change this St
25:20 - widget into a consumer
25:23 - widget now I need to add a second
25:25 - property inside this build method which
25:27 - is going to be type widget riff and I'm
25:30 - going to just call it riff and now
25:33 - accessing this riff I can do uh I can
25:36 - access to my
25:38 - provider I come here inside this ontap
25:41 - property at the end of my page which is
25:44 - exactly right
25:45 - here and here using this riff I can
25:49 - use some methods like read or watch I
25:53 - need to explain something that there are
25:55 - two methods that we can use using this
25:57 - ref
25:58 - you can use read or you can use watch
26:01 - and there is a big difference between
26:03 - these two meals read and watch and
26:05 - through this project when I'm working
26:07 - you will understand when when do you
26:09 - need to use read and when do you need to
26:11 - use watch so you will understand all of
26:13 - that just make sure to follow
26:16 - along just for now I'm going to tell you
26:18 - this that whenever you're doing
26:19 - something that you need to do it only
26:21 - once you will use the read method but
26:24 - when you uh you use watch method you
26:27 - want to keep keep track of something
26:29 - because you don't want to do it once and
26:32 - you do want it to do multiple times and
26:34 - you want to keep track of the changes
26:36 - that is happening on that provider so in
26:39 - short when you want to keep track of the
26:41 - changes inside the provider and you want
26:43 - to understand whether the value has
26:45 - changed or not you need to use watch but
26:47 - if you don't care if the value changes
26:49 - or not or you don't want to get uh or
26:51 - you don't want to keep track the changes
26:53 - you can use the rate method and mostly
26:56 - inside this on properties is uh we use
26:59 - the red method and inside the Bel
27:02 - methods most of the times we use watch
27:04 - method it's also a tip that you can use
27:06 - it for now I'm going to just use the
27:08 - read method and the provider I'm going
27:10 - to use is this OD service provider so
27:13 - let's just paste it here and also import
27:16 - it now I can access to my sign in with
27:21 - Google method very well I can also make
27:24 - it a synness and await this method
27:29 - we are done what else I want to do is I
27:33 - want to go inside the men. dart and I
27:35 - want to check whether we are signed in
27:37 - or not how can we do it we can do it
27:40 - using a stream Builder so I'm going to
27:41 - just take this login page and instead
27:44 - I'm going to just use an stream Builder
27:47 - so the stream off for this stream
27:49 - Builder will be a method from Firebase
27:52 - art so first of all I need to create an
27:55 - inocence of Firebase art and then I can
27:57 - use a specific method which is used here
28:01 - which is called our state changes and
28:03 - what does this method does it will just
28:06 - go and check what's happening inside
28:09 - fireb alt so it will just give us
28:12 - information about what's going on in the
28:15 - fire o whether we are signed in
28:17 - specifically uh it will check whether we
28:20 - are signed in or not and inside the
28:22 - Builder I can just check it so I'm going
28:26 - to just create two conditions for now
28:27 - the first first conditions will be
28:29 - snapshot. has data and if it's not so if
28:33 - a snapshot. has data is not true it
28:36 - means that we do not have any data in
28:38 - this case I'm going to just go and
28:40 - return a login
28:42 - page and if that's not the case it means
28:46 - that we have data and the user is signed
28:48 - in in that case I'm going to just show a
28:50 - container for now so I'm going to just
28:53 - return
28:55 - container very well now I'm going to
28:57 - just terminate the current project and
29:01 - run it once
29:05 - again so now let's check if it's working
29:08 - or not I'm going to head on the button
29:10 - sign in with Google and I can just
29:12 - choose my Ahmed amini
29:15 - account I really forgot a very big step
29:18 - here I forgot to enable the Google sign
29:21 - in as a provider method to to all of us
29:24 - to sign with it and also I need to
29:26 - generate show one and 256 to be able to
29:29 - use Google sign in I'm really sorry I
29:32 - forgot these two big steps so let's do
29:34 - it right
29:36 - now first of all I'm going to go inside
29:38 - my
29:39 - project let's go inside the
29:41 - authentication
29:48 - part head on the get started and now I
29:51 - want to be able to sign in with Google
29:54 - and we need to just enable the sign in
29:57 - method as you can see these are all the
29:59 - signin videos that you can use to sign
30:01 - in with Firebase email password Google
30:04 - Facebook and a lot of this but what I
30:06 - want to be able to use is Google signin
30:09 - so just hit it here and I just enable it
30:12 - to be able to use Google sign in the you
30:16 - also need to provide a supportive email
30:17 - here and I'm going to just use my T
30:20 - Ahmed amini Emil here and then hit
30:23 - save very well now it's going to be
30:26 - enable us to use Google sign in our fire
30:34 - project it is done and the second thing
30:37 - that I need to do is to generate sha one
30:40 - and sha 256 in my fire project so let's
30:43 - get back to the vs code and open
30:45 - Terminal first of all go to Android and
30:49 - here you need to use a command which
30:51 - will generate but shs in your project
30:54 - just run this command GR signing
30:59 - report and we got an error let me just
31:03 - do it once
31:18 - again yeah it's working and it's
31:20 - generating show and and also shot 256
31:23 - for my Firebase project let's wait for
31:26 - it and now it is buil successfully as
31:28 - you can see so this is the first one
31:31 - show one just copy it get back to the
31:34 - fireb console uh go to project overview
31:38 - and I believe uh I just need to find my
31:42 - app okay now let's go to the first app
31:45 - I'm going to just do it for Android for
31:47 - now and add fingerprint and here you can
31:51 - just paste your first showan and paste
31:54 - it right here and save the file get back
31:57 - to the vs good and now I'm going to just
31:59 - copy the second
32:02 - one add fingerprint and paste the second
32:05 - one very well now that we just generated
32:08 - the Sha one and also sh 256 everything
32:10 - is done and I can just sign it with
32:12 - Google and there should be no
32:14 - problem let's just once again terminate
32:17 - the current project and I'm going to
32:18 - just run it once
32:26 - again very well let's check if it's
32:29 - working click on the signning Google
32:34 - button choose your
32:41 - account yeah very well nice it's working
32:45 - as you can see if I just explain to you
32:47 - what happened right here so first of all
32:50 - we click on this button and it just went
32:53 - to this provider and used and triggered
32:56 - this signing with Google method and when
33:00 - it's triggered this method the signing
33:02 - finished here and in inside and inside
33:06 - the m dot I created a logic like this
33:08 - that create an Builder and inside this
33:11 - Builder we check the current
33:13 - or we check the current OD changes
33:16 - inside our Firebase OD so it just check
33:19 - whether we are signed in or not and we
33:21 - check here that if you are not signed in
33:24 - if the snapshot ha is not true in this
33:26 - case return the login page but if you're
33:29 - signed in just return a container for
33:31 - now but I'm going to change it in the
33:32 - future so I can just put a homepage here
33:36 - and now we'll have this homepage when we
33:38 - are signed in very well it's done it's
33:41 - working and now I need to work on the
33:43 - second part of
33:44 - my signing and R authentication okay so
33:48 - now let's start the second part which is
33:50 - going to be adding all the user data
33:51 - Into the Fire Reser database so not only
33:54 - I want Reser to be signed in with Google
33:56 - but after that I want them to add all
33:58 - the user data into collection and the
34:01 - database and for doing it I need to use
34:03 - the firer database so inside this uh
34:06 - Firebase console as you can see I'm
34:08 - going to open this fire
34:10 - database and now that it's open I can
34:12 - just click on create
34:19 - database here I need to choose a
34:21 - location and I'm going to just choose
34:23 - the southeast uh Asia Singapore it is
34:26 - the nearest place for my location just
34:28 - make sure to choose a place where it's
34:30 - near to where you're living currently
34:32 - just choose your location and hit
34:39 - next the next I'm going to just choose
34:41 - that it is uh only in test mode because
34:42 - it's not a real project and then I can
34:44 - just create this
34:46 - database let's wait for it to be
34:50 - created okay so as you can see the
34:53 - database is created and for now as you
34:55 - can see it's only an empty database and
34:57 - I'm going to just add all the
34:58 - information for user video and
35:00 - everything inside this database so for
35:02 - now it's okay and also this is going to
35:04 - be the rules section and here I can
35:07 - actually change the rules and I'm going
35:09 - to just remove this condition of if I
35:12 - can just remove it just keep in mind
35:14 - that I'm doing this because it's only a
35:16 - test mode project but if it's but if
35:18 - you're creating a project for production
35:21 - make sure to create the appropriate
35:23 - rules to just uh handle all the security
35:27 - things but for now because it's only for
35:29 - test mode I'm going to just publish this
35:30 - rules and that's all
35:32 - right now I can just get back to the vs
35:38 - code here inside the repository I'm
35:40 - going to just create a new file called
35:42 - user data
35:48 - service and here I'm going to just
35:51 - create the class called once again user
35:53 - data service
36:02 - here I need to actually create two fils
36:05 - one is going to be for the Firebase
36:06 - firer and the next one is going to be
36:08 - for Firebase o and I need to create both
36:11 - these and it will help me to use both
36:13 - the packages easily so first of all I'm
36:15 - going to just create the farest o and
36:17 - also it will be imported
36:22 - automatically and the next one is going
36:24 - to be for the farest fire store
36:28 - and let me just first of all import this
36:30 - package cloud
36:37 - firer and now I can create this field
36:40 - for Firebase firar and I'm going to just
36:43 - call this fire ster let me just generate
36:46 - Constructor for this as well and now I
36:49 - can create my first method to actually
36:52 - add the user data to the fire store so
36:55 - I'm going to just call this method add
36:56 - user data to
36:58 - firester and this method is going to be
37:00 - asness and I can just uh do everything
37:04 - necessary inside this method and
37:07 - actually first of all I need to create a
37:09 - user model here because you know if I
37:11 - want to add the user data into this
37:13 - collection of users first of all I need
37:15 - to store that inside a model so first of
37:18 - all I need to create this
37:21 - model so I'm going to just create a new
37:23 - folder called model and inside that I
37:26 - can actually create a a file called user
37:36 - model I'm going to just name this user
37:39 - model and I will create all the fs
37:41 - accessory to this user model and I'm
37:43 - going to have a lot of fields like
37:45 - display name username email profile
37:47 - picture and all of this so let me just
37:49 - create them one by
37:51 - one the first one is going to be a
37:53 - string called display name it is the
37:56 - first fied I want to create for this
37:59 - model the next one is going to be for
38:01 - the username let me just create
38:06 - it the third one is again a string of
38:11 - EML the next one is going to be for the
38:15 - profile
38:20 - picture the next one is number of
38:24 - subscriptions videos
38:30 - the next one is user ID and let me just
38:32 - also specify the data type which is
38:34 - going to be a
38:38 - string the next one is going to be uh
38:41 - description I also want to have an
38:42 - optional description for each Channel or
38:45 - user so the last one is going to be the
38:48 - type and if you wonder what is this type
38:50 - and why do I even need to use this
38:52 - you'll understand later on when I want
38:54 - to work on the search feature on that
38:56 - time I need to use this type fill inside
38:58 - the user model for now just remember
39:01 - that I'm going to need I'm going to need
39:03 - to use this type and I'm going to also
39:06 - add this field for the video model as
39:09 - well so I want to have it for both user
39:11 - model and also for the video model and
39:13 - that is all you need to know for now now
39:16 - let me just generate Constructor for
39:18 - this as well and I also want to generate
39:20 - Jon
39:22 - calization and that should be okay
39:29 - now I get back to the user data service
39:31 - and here I can actually create an
39:33 - instance of user model so let me just
39:35 - create
39:37 - it let me just import for this user
39:40 - model and then I'm going to just call
39:41 - this user and I will just create the
39:44 - inocence of this user model and now I
39:46 - need to initialize all values for this
39:49 - different fills and actually I'm going
39:51 - to do that using some
39:53 - parameters so I need to create some
39:55 - parameters to fill out the value use for
39:57 - this fills and I'm going to just create
40:00 - them one by
40:01 - one and all of them are going to be
40:04 - required and the first one is going to
40:05 - be for the display
40:07 - name and of course it's a type of string
40:10 - the next one is going to be for the
40:20 - username the next one is a string of
40:24 - ml the next one is for description
40:27 - the next one is going to be for the
40:29 - profile picture again it's a type of a
40:34 - string and the next one actually I have
40:37 - made a mistake here and I have made the
40:40 - wrong data type for the videos and also
40:43 - subscriptions and let me just go to the
40:45 - user model because the videos and the
40:48 - subscriptions is not a type of string
40:50 - but actually the videoos going to be as
40:51 - a type of integer and the subscriptions
40:54 - is going to be a type of list so make
40:56 - sure to just uh correct this it was a
40:58 - mistake this should not be strings and
41:01 - now let me just remove this adj
41:02 - realizations and I have to generate that
41:05 - once again let me just do it real
41:11 - quick okay that should be all right let
41:14 - me also specify that this list is a type
41:16 - of string so I have a list of strings
41:18 - for the
41:19 - subscriptions and I want to just
41:21 - generate Json realization once again I
41:24 - have to correct this error I just need
41:25 - to add an extra parentheses
41:30 - here and actually inside these two
41:33 - methods uh to map and from map maybe I
41:35 - want to change the field for the list of
41:37 - subscriptions because it may have
41:40 - generated the wrong one so I want to
41:43 - just bring some changes
41:48 - here so inside the FR map I'm going to
41:51 - just remove this thing for the
41:53 - subscription and I will create one from
41:56 - my own
41:57 - because this may not work
42:00 - properly so just remove it and instead
42:02 - use this
42:06 - one and now it should be working fine
42:11 - perfectly get back to the user data
42:14 - service and now I can create the actual
42:16 - parameters
42:17 - here uh first of all for the
42:19 - subscriptions let me just create this
42:21 - parameter and actually I don't need to
42:23 - create any parameter for the
42:24 - subscriptions and because for now I'm
42:26 - going to just leave it as an empty list
42:28 - because once the user is created and the
42:30 - channel is created it has no
42:32 - subscriptions it's going to be empty for
42:34 - now so that is the initial value just an
42:37 - empty
42:37 - list and for the videos I'm going to
42:40 - just leave it like zero that should be
42:43 - great and the next one is user
42:45 - ID and for the user ID actually I can
42:48 - just use the current U ID for the
42:50 - current user who is logged in because
42:53 - that is the exact user ID which I want
42:54 - to use and that's going to be unique for
42:56 - every and that's going to be unique for
42:58 - every each user so I can just use this o
43:03 - this in a sense of O and then I'm going
43:05 - to just bring it
43:06 - down and I'm going to just use the
43:09 - current user and then uid so the uid of
43:11 - the current user of the user who is
43:13 - logged in is going to be the user ID of
43:15 - that specific Channel and the final one
43:18 - is going to be the type and I'm going to
43:20 - just leave it as the user because that
43:21 - is a user model the type is going to be
43:23 - a user and later on I'm going to create
43:26 - the video model the top is going to be
43:27 - just a video and once again you will
43:29 - know what this about so just for now
43:31 - don't worry about
43:40 - it now that everything is done and I
43:42 - have the user model I can actually
43:44 - create the collection of users and add
43:47 - the user data inside that collection so
43:49 - I'm going to just use this inance of
43:51 - firestore and then I'm going to use the
43:53 - collection keyword and it will just
43:55 - create a new collection called users and
43:58 - if there's already a collection it will
44:00 - just add the data into the uh collection
44:04 - so I'm going to just go inside the
44:05 - collection of users and then I need to
44:08 - specify a document for this specific
44:10 - collection and this document is going to
44:13 - be just the current user and the U ID
44:17 - and this document is going to be just
44:18 - the current user that I'm going to just
44:20 - add and the uid for it is going to be
44:22 - just the exact user ID which I have so
44:25 - I'm going to just put this us. Curr
44:27 - user. uid as the user ID for this
44:29 - specific document and finally I'm going
44:32 - to just use the set method to actually
44:34 - set the all data I want to be inside
44:36 - that collection and this specific
44:38 - document and here I can just use this
44:40 - inance of user and then use a method
44:42 - called T map that I just created and
44:45 - using this T map I can actually add all
44:47 - the data into the firer
44:49 - database and I can actually add all this
44:52 - data Into the Fire database just like
44:55 - and this is a really better way to do
44:57 - that uh so now this stuff are done and
45:00 - we're good here very well now I have to
45:03 - create a provider for this class so once
45:06 - again we are using the provider FL R PO
45:08 - for this class to handle the set which
45:10 - in this case it is the user so I'm going
45:13 - to create another provider which I'm
45:15 - going to just call it user data service
45:20 - provider and of course once again we are
45:22 - using the simple provider which is a the
45:25 - simplest provider possible in FL rpod
45:28 - and here I'm going to just return this
45:29 - user data service
45:32 - class exactly like the previous example
45:34 - we need to initialize fire a and also
45:37 - fire fire so let's uh let's do it real
45:52 - quick very well and I'm going to just
45:54 - put some commas here to refactor for
45:57 - format de code very well now we have
45:59 - access to this provider and as I said
46:01 - already to you that why do we need to
46:03 - use this providers it will really help
46:05 - us to handle a set and use in this case
46:08 - like the user data we are able to use
46:10 - this user throughout our project and it
46:13 - makes life much easier for
46:15 - us so let's just take this and where do
46:19 - we need to add this provider this user
46:21 - data service provider I'm going to do it
46:23 - in username page so we don't have anyone
46:26 - yet let's create one so I'm going to
46:28 - create a new file which I'm going to
46:29 - just call it username page.
46:32 - Dart import the material. dart and just
46:35 - create an this
46:37 - wiget this is going to be just called
46:40 - username
46:42 - page and here I'm going to just return
46:44 - and
46:45 - scaped so the first thing I want to work
46:48 - on the UI of this uh uh username page
46:51 - and later on we can add the
46:53 - functionality and I will explain to you
46:55 - what each uh uh what do we need to do
46:57 - inside this username pitch so I'm going
47:00 - to I'm going to just explain everything
47:02 - later on first of all let's create the
47:03 - UI of this username pitch let me just
47:07 - run the emulator that we can
47:09 - see how the UI is looking
47:30 - okay this is what we got for now as you
47:32 - can see we are showing the homepage
47:34 - because we showed this inside of our
47:36 - meno Dart let me just open it real quick
47:40 - uh this is our meno Dart and right now
47:42 - what we're showing is just an stream
47:43 - Builder and we are saying that if we are
47:46 - signed in I should show a login page and
47:48 - in other cases I want to show the
47:50 - homepage but I'm going to change this to
47:52 - username page for now later on I will
47:53 - work it I will just change it and fix it
47:56 - completely but for now I'm going to just
47:57 - return the username page that we just
47:59 - created let me also just minimize the vs
48:02 - code that we can just see while we are
48:05 - working on the UI of this username
48:08 - page it's going to be like this okay I'm
48:11 - going to just close this page and open
48:13 - username
48:14 - pitch inside this scold let's move on to
48:17 - the body and here first of all I'm going
48:18 - to just create a safe
48:21 - area the child is going to be a padding
48:23 - widget
48:29 - and we have a symmetric padding widget
48:31 - and I'm going to just give it a padding
48:33 - vertically 26 and also horizontally
48:37 - 14 okay this is going to be my
48:42 - padding let me just close this one as
48:44 - well okay very well I'm going to also
48:47 - put a const here for now only or maybe I
48:51 - should remove
48:52 - it
48:54 - okay inside this padding I can have a
48:57 - text and this text is going to be just
48:59 - saying enter the
49:03 - username I'm going to also change the
49:05 - text style here and give it a color of
49:08 - blue
49:12 - gray very
49:15 - well and as you can see this is what we
49:17 - got for now uh I forgot to add a column
49:20 - here let me just uh take this padding
49:23 - and first of all inside the safe area I
49:25 - want to have a column
49:27 - and inside the children property I can
49:29 - have a lot of widgets and the first
49:31 - widget right here is going to be the
49:33 - padding widget which is a text which
49:35 - says enter the username after this I
49:37 - want to add the next fidget which is a
49:39 - text field so we want to allow user to
49:42 - enter a username and we need a text
49:45 - field to do that so I'm going to just
49:47 - create a text form
49:49 - field which it has a lot of uh
49:51 - properties which I have to add first of
49:55 - all I want to work on the decoration of
49:57 - this text field which is which needs a
50:00 - class called input
50:02 - decoration let me just change the
50:04 - properties first of all I have to give
50:06 - it a hand text which going to be just
50:09 - saying
50:10 - like uh
50:14 - insert
50:16 - username this is going to be my hand
50:19 - text I'm going to also add a border
50:22 - which is the type class of outline input
50:24 - border and it has a b site which I'm
50:28 - going to just change the color inside
50:30 - this border s and I'm going to give you
50:32 - the color of
50:35 - blue let me just put some commas here to
50:38 - format the code now I also want to add
50:41 - uh not only border but enabled border
50:44 - and also Focus border so it just changes
50:47 - uh I want to change the color of this
50:50 - borders on different uh uh conditions
50:53 - for example uh if it is in ened border I
50:57 - want to give it a blue color if it is a
50:59 - focused border I want to give it a green
51:01 - color so let's just quickly work on this
51:03 - one as well first of all if you have an
51:06 - enabled border let me just copy this cod
51:08 - as
51:09 - well I also want the color of the Border
51:12 - Side to be blue but if you have a focus
51:16 - B in this case I want to change the
51:19 - color to something like green and I
51:22 - think this looks very nice as you can
51:25 - see the color is right now blue but if I
51:27 - click on it it got on a focus mode and
51:30 - right now the color is green and it
51:31 - looks very
51:33 - nice the next one I want to add a suffix
51:36 - icon which for now I'm going to just use
51:39 - icons verified user rounded and the
51:43 - color of this suffix icon is going to be
51:46 - just a color of green so I'm going to
51:49 - just give it a colors of green later on
51:52 - I'm going to change this because uh the
51:55 - suffix icon also safix icon color needs
51:58 - to be changed based on validation so let
52:01 - me tell you right now that I want to add
52:03 - a validation feature for this username
52:06 - text field it means that whenever the
52:08 - user is typing a username I'm going to
52:10 - go through the database and I'm checking
52:13 - that if there is a username the same as
52:16 - the user has typed inside this textfield
52:19 - if it is the same it means that this
52:21 - username is already taken and it is
52:23 - similar in this case I'm going to give
52:25 - the user an error to say you have to
52:27 - change your username because it is
52:29 - already taken inside our
52:32 - database so when you want to work on
52:34 - that functionality as well I need to
52:36 - change some UI which one of them is the
52:38 - suffix icon and also suffix icon color
52:40 - which if the validation is true I'm
52:42 - going to show this verified user around
52:44 - it but if the validation is false it
52:47 - mean the user is not allowed to continue
52:49 - I'm going to show it uh cancel icon so
52:53 - I'm going to work on that one as well so
52:55 - I just told you already to
52:57 - know it I also need to wrap this text
53:00 - form field with a padding widget so I'm
53:02 - going to add a padding and the padding
53:04 - is going to be just from right side and
53:07 - also left side give it a padding once
53:10 - from the left side which is going to be
53:11 - a padding of 20 and also from the right
53:14 - side I'm going to give it a padding of
53:16 - 15 let me just also change the left side
53:18 - to
53:20 - 15 again I'm going to just minim uh
53:23 - resize this V good that we can see this
53:26 - emulator properly very well this looks
53:29 - very nice and finally what I need to add
53:34 - is I need to add an spacer first of
53:38 - all because you want to give a resize
53:42 - and finally I need to add a button at
53:44 - the bottom of the ptch because this is
53:46 - where the user will be able to submit
53:48 - this T field so I'm going to just create
53:52 - a flat button so if you wonder what is
53:55 - this a flat button it is is a button
53:56 - that I have already created and I can
53:59 - just open this flat Button as you can
54:01 - see it takes three arguments a text
54:03 - unpress and also a color so you can just
54:05 - change it on uh on whatever you like and
54:10 - inside this widget we have only a
54:12 - container and then a text buttom so it's
54:13 - really simple and of course if you have
54:15 - downloaded this starting project you
54:17 - have access to all this uh widget pages
54:20 - and everything that I'm going to use
54:22 - throughout this project now I have to
54:24 - initialize this text on present
54:27 - the text is going to be just something
54:29 - like continue not anything else the
54:32 - unpress is going to be empty for now
54:34 - later on I'm going to add some stuff to
54:36 - it and the color is going to be just a
54:38 - color of green for now very well and now
54:42 - you're getting an error I don't know
54:43 - what's the reason let me just run this
54:46 - uh project once
54:48 - again let me just terminate this and
54:50 - also run the project once again
54:58 - yeah this is what we have so far uh what
55:01 - I need the final step for the completing
55:04 - of the UI of this page is to just go up
55:08 - and here inside the column I need to
55:10 - change the cross AIS alignment
55:11 - properties and I'm going to just give it
55:13 - something like cross access alignment.
55:16 - stretch and it should solve everything
55:18 - for us and as you can see this is what
55:20 - we got and also the enter usern text is
55:22 - now at the beginning so it's great let
55:25 - me also just give it a padding to this
55:27 - flat button because it's not looking
55:28 - very nice so I'm going to just wrap this
55:31 - with a padding
55:33 - widget and I'm going to just give it a
55:35 - padding from bottom something like 45 or
55:38 - I should give it a little smaller like
55:40 - 30 and also I'm going to give it padding
55:43 - from left side eight and also right side
55:46 - eight and now it looks perfect let's
55:49 - also add some const to this this file
55:53 - because it giving it's giving us some
55:55 - warning which is not looking very nice
55:57 - and Al it's also slowing down the
55:59 - computer so let's just add this const
56:03 - and now everything is good so now that
56:05 - we are done with uh creating of this UI
56:08 - I need to work on the functionality and
56:11 - the first functionality that I'm going
56:12 - to work on is to have the unique user's
56:15 - name so what I basically want to do is
56:18 - to whenever the user is typing something
56:21 - inside this text field and they're
56:23 - entering their username I you want to
56:25 - add this functionality that it should
56:27 - just go and check the database and if
56:30 - the username that is typed inside this
56:32 - text field is similar to any of the text
56:35 - uh to any of the usernames inside my
56:37 - database if they're the same I want to
56:39 - just give an error to the user to say
56:41 - the user name is already taken so this
56:43 - is my goal and let's work on this first
56:47 - I need to change this estate widget to
56:48 - an stateful
56:49 - widget and I need to set uh I need to
56:52 - add some more properties to this text
56:54 - form field right now
56:56 - let me just go inside this textt form
56:58 - field I need to add first of all a
57:00 - controller and also I need a for key
57:04 - here uh we need a key and also I just
57:08 - need to wrap this text form field with a
57:10 - form
57:12 - widget very
57:15 - well so let me just go and create first
57:18 - of all the controller it is a type text
57:20 - editing
57:21 - controller which in this case I'm going
57:23 - to just call it username controller
57:29 - very well and I also going to create a
57:32 - form
57:34 - key I'm going to just call it form key
57:37 - and it is a global
57:39 - key which is the type form
57:43 - State very well I can just use this form
57:46 - key and put it inside the key property
57:50 - inside my text
57:51 - field and I can also put this username
57:55 - controller right
57:59 - here okay now that we have the
58:02 - controller and also the form key I think
58:04 - we are able to continue and create a
58:06 - method right here I'm going to go inside
58:09 - the state and here I need to create a
58:12 - method called validate user uh validate
58:16 - username and this method is void it
58:19 - means that we are not retaining
58:21 - anything and inside this method I want
58:24 - to create this functionality to not all
58:26 - you users enter any similar username
58:28 - which is already inside my
58:30 - database so let me just create an
58:32 - instance of Firebase fir store and then
58:35 - I should go inside users
58:38 - collection and here I need to get
58:40 - everything inside this database and I'm
58:42 - going to just first of all I need to
58:44 - make this method as synr and await this
58:47 - now I should store it inside a variable
58:48 - called users
58:50 - map now that I have access to the users
58:53 - map I can just go ahead and
58:57 - I go and take all the docks and then I
59:00 - can use the map method and using this
59:02 - method I have access to every single
59:04 - user inside this collection and I want
59:07 - to return this user and finally change
59:09 - it to a
59:11 - list now I have a list of users so let
59:14 - me just store it inside this users
59:17 - variable now that we have a list of
59:19 - users I want to create a for Loop and
59:22 - check every single user inside the
59:23 - database and see if the there's a
59:26 - similarity between our username and the
59:28 - usernames inside
59:31 - database so what I can do is to create a
59:34 - for Loop I'm going to just say for user
59:39 - or user in users it means that we are
59:44 - going and checking every single user
59:46 - inside this users class this users list
59:50 - so when we checking it and I'm checking
59:53 - every single user inside this users list
59:56 - which is our database and here first of
59:59 - all I also want to have an
60:01 - string which I'm going to just call it
60:03 - targeted
60:05 - username and I can just give it
60:07 - something like I can make it initially
60:09 - equal to nothing it means I didn't need
60:12 - to give it value for now first of all I
60:14 - need to say user.
60:17 - data username this is the username from
60:20 - database it is every single username
60:23 - inside the database because we are using
60:25 - a for Loop so now now that we have
60:27 - access to every single user username
60:29 - inside the database I can go and check
60:32 - it to see if there is similarity if it's
60:34 - similar to my username that is typed
60:36 - inside the text field my username is
60:39 - called this username controller so let
60:41 - me just take this and I'm going to
60:43 - create a condition to say
60:45 - if username controller. text is equal to
60:49 - this username if that is the case it
60:52 - means if the uh if the username that is
60:56 - typed inside the text field is equal to
60:59 - every single username inside my database
61:02 - if that is the case it means that the
61:04 - username is already taken and in this
61:06 - case I don't want to allow user to
61:09 - continue so let me just create a a
61:12 - Boolean here I'm going to call it is
61:15 - validate and using this Boolean is
61:17 - validate uh it just allow us to keep
61:20 - track of validation and we can
61:22 - understand on which case the validation
61:24 - is false or true
61:26 - if that is the case it means that
61:28 - validation is not true so I'm going to
61:29 - put I'm going to change this is validate
61:32 - property equal to false and I'm going to
61:35 - do a c set
61:37 - also very well but I also want to make
61:40 - another condition because in the first
61:42 - condition we just saw uh we just uh told
61:45 - that if the username controller it means
61:47 - the username that that is typed inside
61:49 - the text field is similar to one of the
61:52 - usernames I want to make the validation
61:55 - false it means I I want all user to
61:57 - continue but what if the user changes
61:59 - the username when they see that they are
62:01 - getting error they want to change the
62:03 - username in this case I'm going to add
62:05 - another condition to
62:07 - say if the username controller the text
62:11 - it means the my
62:14 - username it is not equal to targeted
62:19 - username targeted username is the
62:21 - username that uh already was in our
62:24 - database and it was equal to my username
62:27 - I also need to add this inside my
62:30 - targeted username
62:32 - here this username that was inside my
62:37 - database if you got confused on while I
62:41 - was working I'm going to explain it once
62:42 - I'm done so don't worry a lot about
62:46 - it I'm saying that if the username
62:48 - controller. text it means the username
62:50 - that is typed inside the text field is
62:52 - not equal to the targeted username in
62:54 - this case all you want to make make the
62:56 - is valid property once again equal to
62:59 - true and also I'm going to do a set set
63:01 - once again and now we are done creating
63:04 - this validate username so let me just
63:07 - check uh let me just review it once
63:09 - quickly that what I've done inside this
63:11 - method first of all I just moved on to
63:13 - the collection of users and got
63:15 - everything inside this database and then
63:18 - I had this users map I use this map
63:21 - method to access every single user
63:24 - inside this database and change it to a
63:26 - list so now we have a list of
63:29 - users then I created a for Loop and I uh
63:32 - and I just told that go inside every
63:35 - single user in the list of users and now
63:39 - inside this forup we are checking that
63:41 - if the username that we are typing
63:43 - inside the text field is equal to user.
63:46 - data. username which is basically every
63:49 - single username inside our database so
63:52 - if our username is equal to every single
63:54 - username inside
63:56 - each one of the username I should say
63:57 - like this that if our username is equal
64:00 - to each of that usernames inside the
64:02 - database I don't want to allow user to
64:04 - continue so I'm going to uh make this as
64:07 - validate equal to false I don't want to
64:09 - allow user to continue because the
64:11 - validation is not true but I want to
64:13 - also make another condition to say if
64:15 - the user changes the username it means
64:18 - that if they uh changing the username
64:20 - that my username is not equal to that uh
64:23 - repeated username in that case I want to
64:25 - make is validate equal to true and I
64:27 - want to all user to continue this is
64:29 - basically all I did to create this
64:33 - validation now I need to put this method
64:36 - somewhere and I'm going to just put it
64:37 - inside the unchanged property in the
64:39 - text form field let me just find this
64:42 - text form field and here we have an
64:44 - unchanged property which takes an
64:46 - argument which is just our username if
64:49 - you wonder what is this unchanged uh
64:51 - property or I should say listener inside
64:53 - this text form field it is a list that
64:56 - triggers every time we release a key on
64:59 - the keyboard it means that whenever you
65:00 - start typing on the text form field this
65:03 - unchanged property will be triggering
65:05 - every time so I think this is the best
65:07 - place to add this valid username method
65:10 - so I'm going to just put this method
65:11 - here I also want to add another property
65:15 - which is validator it Al uh once again
65:18 - it takes the username and here we can
65:20 - change this as well and also I have Auto
65:24 - validate mode which I'm going to also
65:25 - change this one to always when I change
65:28 - this one to always it just allow us to
65:30 - see the changes real time and we don't
65:33 - need to wait to submit the button and in
65:35 - real time you can see the changes and
65:37 - the
65:37 - validation very well now everything
65:40 - should be
65:43 - good the final step is to change the UI
65:47 - based on validation I take this as
65:50 - validate property and I'm going to
65:51 - change some stuff based on whether the
65:54 - validation is true or or false the first
65:57 - thing that I need to change is this
65:58 - suffix icon so I'm going to say that if
66:01 - is validated is true I'm going to show
66:03 - this verified user rounded icon but if
66:06 - it is false I want to show a cancel
66:09 - icons I need to remove this
66:14 - const I also need to change the color
66:17 - based on whether we
66:19 - are uh able to continue or not so I'm
66:22 - going to say f is validate uh if is
66:26 - validate is equal to true I need to show
66:28 - I need to use a colors of green but if
66:31 - it is equal to false I want to show a
66:33 - color of red which basically just tells
66:36 - the user that something is wrong
66:39 - here
66:42 - okay I also need to change the
66:44 - background color of this flat button on
66:47 - whether we are uh the validation is true
66:50 - or false so let me just check it once
66:53 - again that if is validated equal to true
66:55 - I want to show a color of green but if
66:58 - it is equal false I want to show a color
67:00 - of
67:01 - red not red I mean something like uh
67:04 - green but with a shade of
67:07 - 100 that looks perfect it's something
67:09 - like white color we change the
67:12 - background color of this flat button I
67:13 - also need to change this onpress but not
67:15 - now I will do it later on when we add
67:17 - something inside that and I change the
67:20 - suffix icon color the suffix
67:23 - icon and I believe that is all I need to
67:25 - change on whether we are able to
67:28 - continue and we are validate to continue
67:30 - or we are not valid
67:32 - it okay that is okay for
67:37 - now let me just put some const
67:40 - here we are getting all these errors
67:43 - because my computer is not really
67:44 - working well right now that is why that
67:47 - these errors are not permanent it's just
67:50 - temporary
67:51 - errors because my computer is really
67:53 - slowing down right now
67:59 - okay right now let's go and work on the
68:02 - last step I need which is to add the
68:05 - user data inside the collection of users
68:07 - whenever we are pressing this button so
68:11 - as I already told you inside this
68:13 - username page the responsibility of this
68:15 - username page is not to only enter and
68:18 - allow user to enter the username the
68:20 - responsibility is to add the whole
68:22 - user's data inside the database inside
68:25 - this onpress property so I want to do
68:27 - this so let me just leave a comment to
68:30 - say add users data inside database so
68:35 - that is what you want to do inside this
68:37 - onpress and for doing it first of all I
68:40 - need
68:41 - to change this stateful widget to a
68:44 - consumer stateful widget we already saw
68:46 - how can we change an EST this widget to
68:48 - a consumer widget but right now we are
68:50 - seeing how can we do it to a stateful
68:51 - widget so let me just do it all you need
68:54 - to do is to just just add a consumer
68:57 - before this stateful
68:58 - widget and I'm going to just oh I'm
69:01 - going to just also import the flut
69:04 - package and I also need to do this
69:07 - before this state right here and also
69:10 - this one and once I do it the errors
69:12 - will be gone now I have
69:15 - this uh consumer stateful widget which
69:17 - allow me to use the
69:19 - ri and connect between all my providers
69:23 - inside flut River pot so now I'm going
69:25 - to use the Riff and then I'm going to
69:26 - use the read method and the provider
69:29 - that I'm going to using here is user
69:32 - data service provider and right now I'm
69:36 - able to use this add user data to fire
69:38 - store
69:40 - method as you can see we have some
69:42 - properties here that I need to
69:44 - initialize a display name username email
69:47 - description and profile picture so I
69:49 - have to initialize all of them uh about
69:52 - display name email address and also
69:54 - pfile picture I will pass them as
69:56 - parameters and I will just initialize
69:58 - them inside the men D so first of all
70:01 - let me just create
70:03 - them I'm going to create a final
70:08 - string display
70:11 - name final
70:17 - string perect pick and also
70:20 - final string display name profile
70:23 - picture and also I need an
70:26 - ml very well I'm going to just generate
70:30 - Constructor for them and now everything
70:32 - should be
70:35 - good okay very good now let's go to the
70:37 - bottom of the page and put that values
70:39 - inside this method for display name it
70:43 - is widget. display
70:46 - name also I'm going to do the same for
70:49 - email and exactly the same for profile
70:52 - picture
70:55 - very good about the username I can just
70:57 - use the username controller.
71:00 - text and also the description will be
71:02 - empty for now because whenever you're
71:04 - creating a new user it does not have a
71:07 - description but later on the person can
71:09 - just add a description on their own so
71:12 - first of all I'm going to just put this
71:13 - initially equal to empty now we have all
71:17 - this uh display name username email
71:19 - description and profile pictures and
71:21 - everything is good let me also just make
71:23 - this method as sign this and I wait this
71:26 - uh
71:29 - method now everything should be good and
71:31 - we should be able to add user data to
71:33 - the fire restore and as a final steps I
71:37 - also want to add this validation here
71:39 - I'm going to just
71:42 - say if is validate is equal to true I'm
71:46 - able to just uh run this method but if
71:50 - it is equal to false I'm going to just
71:51 - return a null it means that the user
71:53 - will not be able to uh use this add user
71:56 - data to F store when the validation is
71:59 - not true and also I'm going to do the
72:01 - same for the validator
72:05 - property here I'm going to just say
72:07 - return if is validate is equal to true
72:10 - in this case I'm going to just return
72:13 - null and what does null mean it means
72:16 - that it there's no problem but if it is
72:18 - equal to false it means that we are
72:20 - having some error I'm going to just
72:22 - return username
72:25 - already
72:27 - taken so I want to return this let me
72:30 - just explain what we did here inside the
72:33 - validator I uh first of all we have this
72:35 - username and here I'm going to just say
72:38 - if is validate is equal to true it means
72:40 - that there is no problem and we can just
72:42 - continue in this case I'm going to
72:44 - return a null it means that there is no
72:46 - problem but if the a Val is equal to
72:49 - false it means there is a problem and
72:51 - I'm going to return this text which is
72:54 - the exact exception to tell the user
72:56 - that the username already
72:59 - taken very well everything is good now I
73:03 - can just go on and continue whether it
73:05 - is working or not so let me just run the
73:07 - emulator once
73:12 - again ah of course we should have some
73:14 - error I forgot one step now I need to go
73:17 - inside the men do Dart and I need to add
73:20 - one more functionality right here so
73:23 - what we doing inside the men dot for now
73:25 - is just we are having an stram Builder
73:27 - and we are checking whether we are
73:28 - signed in or not using this special
73:30 - method or set changes and we are
73:33 - checking if you're signed in if we have
73:35 - not any data it means that we are not
73:37 - signed in I want to just return login
73:40 - page in other cases we are returning a
73:42 - username page but that is not all I want
73:44 - to do after I checked that I am signed
73:47 - in or not in the first condition which
73:50 - says if you're not signed in just return
73:52 - a login page I'm going to also put
73:54 - another condition which says if the data
73:57 - is loading I need to return a loader so
73:59 - I'm going to just say that if the
74:01 - snapshot that connection is set is equal
74:03 - to connection is said. waiting it means
74:05 - that the data is loading for now I'm
74:07 - going to just return a
74:09 - loader and if you wonder what is this
74:11 - loader it is a pre-built widget I have
74:14 - created and it is just simply a size box
74:16 - with a height and width and also a
74:18 - circular progress indicator and of
74:19 - course you have access to it when if you
74:22 - have downloaded the starting project
74:25 - okay and the final thing that I want to
74:27 - do is to add a second stream Builder
74:30 - here and in the second stream Builder I
74:33 - want to check whether the user data is
74:36 - added to the fire resore or not let me
74:38 - just explain it real quick in the
74:40 - firstam Builder we are checking that if
74:42 - the user is signed in or not and if they
74:44 - are not signed in we are returning a
74:46 - login page if the data is loading you
74:48 - want to show a loader and if you are
74:50 - signed in I want to show another stream
74:53 - Builder and in the second stream Builder
74:55 - I want to check whether the data is
74:57 - added to the fire or not so you can just
75:00 - guess that in the Stream property I need
75:02 - to add something related to my database
75:05 - okay so let's just go and create an
75:07 - inance of Firebase
75:10 - firer I'm going to just move on to the
75:12 - collection of
75:13 - users the doc will be the uid of the
75:17 - current users uid so I'm going to just
75:20 - create a
75:22 - Firebase inance and then I'm going to
75:24 - use the Char user. uid and finally I
75:28 - need to use the snapshots you just know
75:30 - that whenever we using a stream Builders
75:32 - we always use this
75:34 - snapshots now inside the second stream
75:37 - Builder let's also check whether the
75:38 - data is added or not so I'm going to
75:41 - create some more conditions the first
75:43 - condition I'm going to just say if the
75:45 - snapshot. has data is not
75:48 - true
75:50 - or this is basically a sign in Dart
75:53 - programming language to say or
75:55 - or snapshot the data that
76:00 - exists is again not true if that is the
76:04 - case it means that the user data is not
76:06 - added to forer and in this case I'm
76:08 - going to just return the username
76:11 - pitch and I need to give a value to this
76:14 - uh display name Prof for picture and
76:16 - email as well so I just need to create
76:18 - an in of Firebase alt to
76:23 - say now now I have access to this
76:25 - current user which is basically the user
76:27 - that has signed in right now and I can
76:29 - just use its values so I'm going to just
76:33 - store it inside a variable called user
76:35 - and I can just use this user to
76:36 - initialize display name profile picture
76:38 - and also
76:46 - email the next one is profile picture
76:49 - and I'm going to use that as
76:53 - well it is a F URL I
76:56 - mean and also the final one is
77:08 - ml so in the first condition we are
77:11 - checking that if we do not have any data
77:13 - in this case I want to return the
77:15 - username page and we already know that
77:17 - inside the username page we add all the
77:19 - users data inside the users collection
77:22 - and our database
77:25 - in the second condition once again I'm
77:27 - going to check if there is the data is
77:29 - loading I want to return a loader so if
77:32 - the snapshot do connection instead is
77:34 - equal to connection instead.
77:38 - waiting in this case I'm going to just
77:40 - return a
77:42 - loader and finally if the snapshot that
77:45 - has data is not equal to false it means
77:48 - that the we have the data it is not
77:50 - loading in this case I'm going to just
77:53 - return the homepage
77:56 - so let me just uh review it once really
77:59 - quickly we have twoam Builders inside
78:02 - the main. inside the firstam Builder I'm
78:05 - checking whether we are signed in or not
78:07 - it means that I'm going to use this
78:09 - outstate changes method and I say if we
78:12 - are not signed in go to the login page
78:15 - if you are getting the data and it's
78:17 - loading just return a loader widget and
78:19 - finally when we have the data I want to
78:21 - return this stream Builder the second
78:24 - stream Builder
78:26 - in the second stream Builder I'm
78:27 - checking inside my users collection
78:30 - inside my database and I'm checking that
78:32 - okay I'm signed in but does the this
78:35 - user that has signed in uh has added the
78:39 - data to the fire sore or not so I'm
78:41 - going to check it right this that if the
78:43 - data is not added to the fire s I'm
78:46 - going to return a username page which
78:48 - all user to add the data and if it is
78:51 - loading return a loader and if you have
78:53 - the data and everything is done just
78:55 - return the homepage right now let me
78:57 - just run the project to see does it work
79:00 - or
79:03 - not right now we are inside the homepage
79:05 - because I have already signed in let me
79:08 - just uh close this uh
79:11 - project and I'm going to go and delete
79:13 - the whole
79:19 - project and right now I want to go and
79:22 - run the project once again
79:27 - very well as you can see when we open
79:30 - the app for the first time we get this
79:32 - login pitch and this is exactly in the
79:35 - firstam Builder that we don't have any
79:37 - data uh right here so we are having this
79:40 - login pitch when I click on the button
79:42 - we can sign in with Google uh first of
79:45 - all let me just uh connect to the
79:47 - internet because I forgot to connect
79:50 - it okay as you can see I have this two
79:55 - uh IDs these two accounts signed in let
79:59 - me just uh first of all open my database
80:01 - inside uh Firebase
80:07 - console okay this is my project and I'm
80:09 - going to just move on to the firestore
80:12 - database and I have already these two
80:15 - accounts these two users inside my
80:17 - collection but I want to just delete one
80:20 - of
80:21 - them okay right now inside my collection
80:25 - and users collection I have only one
80:27 - account it is the display name Ahmed
80:29 - amini and also the username Ahmed amini
80:32 - not capitalized so just keep this in
80:34 - mind because I'm going to check it right
80:37 - now let's get back to the emulator I'm
80:39 - going to sign in with my second account
80:41 - take Ahmed amini that I just removed it
80:43 - from my collection right now I'm going
80:46 - to just select this
80:51 - one and as you can see it is taking me
80:53 - to the username page let me just open vs
80:56 - code right now the authentication is
80:59 - done so the first Builder is done and
81:01 - now it just uh open the second stream
81:04 - Builder and because the user data is not
81:07 - added it open the username page right
81:09 - this
81:10 - one and now let's check the validation
81:13 - that it's working or not as you saw the
81:15 - username for the first account was Ahmed
81:18 - amini if I type the same username it
81:20 - should give me an error or should not
81:22 - allow me to continue so let me just type
81:25 - that one Ahmed amini and as you can see
81:29 - it's not working whenever I type a
81:31 - username which is already inside my
81:33 - database as you can see this is the
81:34 - username in my database it's giving me
81:38 - an error to say username already taken
81:40 - and right now if I click this it won't
81:43 - work because I said if the validation is
81:45 - false you should not all user to add the
81:47 - user data so I need to change this and
81:50 - when I change it I back uh again I can
81:53 - once again enter and continue the
81:56 - process okay I'm going to just type
82:00 - div coder this is going to be my
82:02 - username and right now I'm able to
82:05 - continue and when I hit continue I will
82:08 - be navigated to the homepage because
82:11 - when we have the data we want to show
82:13 - the homepage everything is working and
82:15 - it works perfectly
82:19 - fine now let's just move on to the next
82:21 - feature that you want to create in this
82:22 - project which is going to be the channel
82:24 - feature
82:25 - so as you can see inside the starting
82:27 - project I have already this channel
82:30 - feature inside which I have just a
82:31 - widget uh folder inside I have these two
82:34 - files the first one is the settings
82:36 - dialogue and also the second one is the
82:38 - settings item and of course if you have
82:40 - downloaded the storing project you have
82:42 - access to all of these files and folders
82:45 - and everything should be good to
82:47 - you so inside the channel folder I need
82:49 - to create two folders the first one is
82:52 - going to be for my channel and also the
82:54 - second one is going to be for the user
82:55 - channel so of course I could just
82:58 - created one single page for this but I'm
83:01 - not going to do that and I want to just
83:03 - have two separate files and Pages for my
83:05 - channel and also the user's Channel and
83:08 - it will make my life much easier and you
83:10 - will see how I'm going to do that and if
83:12 - you can just understand what I'm saying
83:13 - you will understand once I'm working on
83:16 - it so let's just uh create the first
83:18 - folder which is going to be my
83:22 - channel and the next one is going to to
83:24 - be the user
83:26 - Channel and basically I just want to put
83:29 - everything related to my channel inside
83:31 - this folder and everything related to
83:33 - the user Channel inside this folder and
83:35 - what I mean by the user's channel is
83:37 - every other channel but not my own
83:39 - channel which Inside by Channel I'm
83:41 - going to just show my own user it mean
83:43 - uh the carrying users data and inside
83:46 - the user Channel I'm going to show any
83:48 - other user channel that the user clicks
83:50 - on you will understand what I'm seeing
83:51 - later on when Once I'm working on it and
83:54 - and for now I'm going to just work on my
83:56 - channel and then when I finish on that I
83:58 - will work in the user Channel let me
84:00 - just also put this widget folder inside
84:02 - my channel which I'm going to need it
84:04 - and I can also create a new folder which
84:06 - I'm going to just call pages and I will
84:08 - put all the screens inside this
84:10 - folder but before working on a channel I
84:13 - need to work inside my homepage let me
84:17 - just uh go to the
84:20 - homepage and right here what I want to
84:23 - do is to display
84:24 - my profile picture inside the homepage
84:26 - that whenever someone comes to the
84:28 - homepage which is going to be the first
84:30 - page that appears whenever the user
84:32 - opens this YouTube colum uh the first
84:34 - page that they are going to see is this
84:35 - homepage and I want to show and display
84:39 - the profile picture right inside the
84:40 - homepage which when the user opens the
84:43 - app they can see that on which account
84:45 - they are signed in so first of all let
84:48 - me just uh open the emulator and run the
84:51 - project
85:09 - okay the project is running and as you
85:10 - can see the first page that I'm seeing
85:12 - is this homepage and I want to just
85:15 - create this circle Avatar inside which I
85:17 - will show the perfect picture right here
85:20 - next to this search icon so let me just
85:22 - work on it and and what I'm going to do
85:26 - is let me just close this extra tabs
85:29 - that we can see the vs code properly and
85:31 - work good and after this padding widget
85:33 - inside which I show an image button of
85:35 - search I just want to go ahead and
85:37 - create a circle water and inside that I
85:40 - can just show the purple picture of the
85:42 - current user who has signed in and I
85:45 - will just give it a radius
85:47 - of something like
85:52 - 15 and also a background color of gray
85:55 - for
85:56 - now and this is what we have and I can
85:59 - also wrap it with a padding widget let
86:01 - me just resize this V Cod that you can
86:03 - see emulator properly and I will put it
86:06 - right
86:07 - here and like this very well I'm going
86:11 - to just wrap this circle of water with a
86:13 - padding
86:16 - widget and I will give it a padding from
86:18 - the right side which is going to be a
86:19 - padding of eight and now it should look
86:22 - much beautiful and and I can just
86:24 - increase this padding to something like
86:26 - 12 and now it should be much better okay
86:31 - the next I want to display my profile
86:33 - picture inside of the circle water so
86:36 - whenever the user signs in and they will
86:38 - see this homepage for the first time
86:39 - they should see their profile picture
86:41 - which is going to be the current user
86:43 - profile picture inside the circle water
86:45 - so let's just work on it and for doing
86:48 - it I need to create a consumer widget so
86:50 - up to now we have saw we have seen that
86:53 - how can weate create I mean how can we
86:55 - convert a stess widget into a consumer
86:58 - widget and using this consumer widget we
87:00 - can just listen to all changes to a
87:02 - specific provider and change the UI
87:05 - based on that provider and all the
87:07 - values but not only we are able to just
87:10 - change like this stad lless widget into
87:12 - a consumer widget I'm also able to just
87:15 - create a consumer widget in some parts
87:17 - of this stad widget I mean that I don't
87:20 - have to just convert the whole stad
87:22 - widget into a consumer widget I can just
87:24 - create one inside the file let me just
87:26 - do it like
87:27 - this I can just create a consumer widget
87:29 - which is just a very simple widget which
87:32 - comes from the FL package and H and now
87:35 - it has a builder property and right here
87:38 - I can just return whatever I
87:40 - want so let me come like this and then I
87:44 - have access to this riff and we
87:46 - basically know that using this riff I
87:48 - can do anything and connect my consumer
87:50 - budget to provider that I want to so let
87:53 - me just use this RI and then the watch
87:55 - method and right here I need to use a
87:57 - provider to get to just fetch me the
88:00 - current users data so how can I do it I
88:04 - need to create that method and also that
88:07 - provider so I want to create it inside
88:10 - this authentication uh feature let me
88:12 - just go inside the repository and then
88:14 - user data service and inside this user
88:17 - data service as you can see we have the
88:20 - first method add user data to the fire
88:22 - store so this is the first first method
88:24 - that allow us to add the data but not
88:26 - only we want to add the data but we also
88:28 - want to fish the data back so let me
88:30 - just create the second method and fet
88:32 - the data from the fire store and I'm
88:34 - going to just call it
88:39 - fetch current user
88:41 - data and of course it's going to be an
88:44 - inchron method and here I can use the
88:46 - fire store and go inside the collection
88:48 - of users and the do and the document ID
88:52 - is just going to be the U ID of the
88:53 - current user
88:55 - uh account so I'm going to just use the
88:56 - a current user and uid and finally I'm
89:01 - going to get back all the data that I
89:03 - get from this collection and I can just
89:06 - store it inside a variable which I can
89:08 - just call it current user map now I want
89:13 - to convert this map into a user model so
89:16 - we already have a user model so I'm
89:18 - going to use this and I can just use um
89:22 - I can use a method called from map that
89:24 - we already created inside this user
89:26 - model so let me just go inside as you
89:28 - can see we have two methods to map and
89:30 - also from map that we just uh generated
89:33 - using the sterilization and using these
89:36 - two special methods to map and from map
89:38 - I can add and also fed the data from
89:40 - firer we already saw that how we added
89:42 - the data to fire using two map but now
89:45 - we are getting back the data from the
89:46 - from map so I just use the from map
89:49 - method from this user model and now I
89:51 - need to provide a map which is going to
89:52 - be the current user
89:55 - map. data so now we have the data and I
89:58 - can just return this user which is a
90:00 - type user model I'm going to also
90:02 - specify what we are returning from this
90:05 - uh method which is going to be a future
90:07 - of user
90:10 - model very well now that I have the
90:13 - method I also want to create a provider
90:15 - for this one and I can just go ahead and
90:18 - create the first folder called provider
90:20 - inside this authentication and I can
90:23 - just create this first and also the last
90:26 - provider that we have here which is
90:28 - going to be a future provider of current
90:30 - user provider so I can just call it user
90:33 - provider and here I need to create a
90:36 - future provider up to now we also only a
90:39 - simple provider and using that provider
90:41 - we were able to connect different
90:43 - providers we use drift use CER widgets
90:45 - but above that I'm also able to just
90:49 - create a future provider future provider
90:51 - is just an alternative to Future Builder
90:54 - which we have in flut SDK itself and
90:56 - it's a much more useful way which makes
90:58 - our code maintainable and readable and
91:00 - also organizable so I just uh can say
91:03 - that future provider is much better uh
91:06 - Choice than a future Builder from the FL
91:08 - SDK and we can just simply create it
91:11 - like any other provider I'm going to
91:13 - just uh first give it a name
91:15 - like current user
91:18 - provider and then I can just specify the
91:21 - type of Provider which is in this case a
91:23 - future provider and as you can see we
91:26 - already have this riff and what I want
91:29 - to do is to just use this Riff to find
91:33 - the method that I just created inside
91:35 - user data service this fetch user uh
91:38 - this fetch cing user data so let me just
91:40 - use this R and then the watch method and
91:43 - then the provider that I need to use
91:45 - just guess it which provider it's the
91:47 - current user data I mean it's user data
91:49 - service provider if you remember it and
91:52 - then I can just use the fish current
91:54 - user data provider and I'm going to also
91:56 - make this method asnr and await
91:59 - this and finally I can just insert it
92:02 - inside a variable of type user model
92:04 - which I'm going to just call it user and
92:07 - I'm going to return this user let me
92:10 - also import this user model and I will
92:12 - also just specify the type of this
92:14 - feature provider which in this case user
92:16 - model here we just specify that we are
92:18 - returning a user model from this future
92:21 - provider so now let me just use this
92:24 - current user uh provider which is a type
92:26 - feature provider and I'm just going to
92:27 - paste it here and import
92:30 - it and here I have access to a special
92:33 - method called win and what is this win
92:36 - it is all us to just organize our code
92:39 - based on different situations like if
92:41 - you have the data if you're having an
92:44 - error and what if if the data is loading
92:47 - so we can just handle the data and show
92:48 - it to the UI based on different
92:51 - scenarios and first of all let me just
92:53 - specify Y what if we have loading I just
92:55 - want to show a loader page and of course
92:58 - we have this inside the starting project
93:00 - and the next if there is an error I'm
93:03 - going to just return this error page
93:05 - again we have this inside the starting
93:07 - project and when we have the data
93:09 - actually I want to return this portol
93:12 - picture which is going to be this circle
93:14 - Avatar so let me just copy it and now
93:17 - I'm going to paste it right here and the
93:19 - data is going to be just the current
93:21 - user in this case
93:25 - and everything is
93:27 - good I also need to return this riff and
93:32 - put accounts here so everything is good
93:34 - and what we are saying is basically we
93:36 - have a consumer widget to just listen to
93:38 - our providers and change the UI based on
93:41 - different values and then I'm going to
93:43 - return this r. watch and we use this
93:45 - current user provider which is a type
93:47 - future provider and we are just saying
93:50 - that when we have an error we want to
93:52 - show this error pitch if the data is
93:54 - loading we want to show a loader and
93:56 - when we have the actual data I just want
93:58 - to show a per I mean I just want to show
94:00 - a circle aor inside which I want to just
94:04 - uh show the background
94:06 - image so I'm going to just use the
94:08 - cached Network image provider and the
94:10 - URL is going to be current
94:13 - user do powerfold picture let me just
94:17 - remove this Con and everything should be
94:19 - good very well and now we should be able
94:22 - to see our own Prof Prof picture the
94:24 - current user profile picture inside the
94:26 - homepage using this consumer widget so
94:28 - let's check it we have this error let me
94:31 - just uh terminate the project and run it
94:33 - once
94:43 - again as you can see the data is loading
94:45 - and while loading it shows me uh a
94:48 - circle uh
94:50 - indicator because it's loading the data
94:53 - on one it data is loaded it shows me the
94:55 - profile picture and this is the current
94:57 - user's profile picture and everything is
94:59 - working fine now that we are done with
95:01 - the homage I can just get back to the
95:02 - channel feature and start creating my
95:05 - pages and everything inside this folder
95:08 - so first of all I need to create a file
95:11 - for the my channel screen so let me just
95:14 - create this file real quick which I can
95:16 - just call it my channel
95:19 - screen and inside this file I just want
95:22 - to show everything related to my channel
95:25 - basically what I want to create is just
95:28 - uh a page inside which I want to show
95:30 - all my the current users data which is
95:32 - going to be my peral picture display
95:34 - name username number of subscriptions
95:37 - and videos and also a tab bar and a tab
95:39 - view so I just want to create this so
95:41 - let's go ahead and do it I need to uh
95:45 - import this material. Dart and then I
95:48 - can just create this status fidget which
95:49 - I'm going to just call it
95:51 - my channel
95:57 - screen so now let's create this scaffold
96:01 - inside of which we have a body and just
96:04 - like always a safe
96:05 - area the child is a padding the padding
96:09 - is going to be just from for now only
96:12 - from the top side which I'm going to
96:13 - give it a padding of 12 I mean 20 and
96:16 - also the child is going to be a column
96:18 - so now inside this column first of all
96:21 - let me just give a cons to this scaffold
96:23 - inside this column the first thing that
96:25 - I want to create is a circle a and I
96:28 - want to just show my profile picture
96:31 - inside the circle of water and I will
96:33 - give it a radius of 34 a background
96:36 - color of something like
96:38 - gray and I will also show the background
96:41 - image but for now I'm not going to do it
96:44 - let me just run the project that we can
96:45 - see what we have so far
96:57 - okay we are again inside this homepage
96:59 - so for now I'm going I'm going to just
97:01 - change the men Dart and instead of the
97:04 - homepage I just want to show my
97:07 - channel and it's not going to be last
97:09 - forever because once I'm done and I have
97:13 - created some of the pages I will just
97:15 - convert this into the home screen and I
97:17 - will put the my channel screen uh on the
97:21 - wherever it's needed but it's just going
97:23 - to going to be for now that I can just
97:25 - uh show you that how I'm creating this
97:27 - page and again I'm going to just
97:29 - minimize this WIS that you can see
97:31 - properly the
97:33 - emulator okay let's just go ahead and
97:35 - create this my channel screen and the
97:39 - first thing I need to change this main
97:41 - access alignment to Center that I can
97:44 - just Center this actually not like this
97:47 - so I'm not going to do this and instead
97:49 - I'm going to just wrap this circular
97:50 - water with the center
97:52 - vet and now we have this right here I
97:55 - can also increase this uh to something
97:57 - like 38 that it gets much
98:01 - bigger after this circle AAR I want to
98:04 - show something like a display name and
98:07 - for doing it I just need to create a
98:08 - text and for now my displ name is going
98:11 - to be Ahmed amini let's also change the
98:14 - styling of this
98:19 - text we will have a f size of something
98:21 - like 24 f Way of
98:27 - buold and that's all for
98:30 - now this is what we got I can also
98:32 - increase this phone size actually to
98:34 - something like 27 that it gets much
98:37 - bigger I'm it
98:41 - 26 the next I want to create a rich text
98:44 - so inside this Rich text what I want to
98:46 - create is basically I want to show the
98:49 - username number of subscriptions and
98:51 - also number of videos inside this rich
98:54 - first of all let me just remove this
98:55 - const and put it right here right here
98:58 - and right here and here I need to create
99:03 - a text text is pan and it has a children
99:07 - and I'm going to create three children
99:09 - for it one is going to be for the
99:11 - username the next one for number of
99:12 - subscriptions and final one is for
99:14 - number of
99:15 - videos so let me just create
99:20 - them the first one is going to be my
99:22 - username so I can just call something
99:23 - like ahmar Das
99:26 - amini I can also just copy and paste it
99:29 - some more times some two times
99:31 - more and the next one is going to be for
99:34 - number of subscriptions and initially
99:36 - it's going to be equal to no
99:38 - subscriptions because whenever the user
99:40 - creates account for the first time there
99:42 - is no subscriptions and also there is no
99:45 - videos so I'm going to just write like
99:47 - this as you can see nothing is
99:48 - displaying into the emulator and the
99:50 - reason is that I haven't changed the
99:52 - text Style and right now the color is
99:54 - just something like white and you can't
99:56 - see it so let me just change the
100:00 - styling here we are going to have a
100:02 - color of like blue
100:07 - gray and let's see how does it look like
100:09 - it looks good let me just also add some
100:12 - spaces right
100:14 - here and now it should look much
100:18 - better and finally I also want to add a
100:21 - text here to say just more
100:25 - about this channel just like the actual
100:30 - YouTube and I just need to add some
100:33 - padding to this as you can see it's not
100:34 - really looking very nice so I need to
100:37 - add some padding to it and first of all
100:39 - I'm going to just wrap this text for
100:41 - display name and wrap it with a padding
100:43 - of
100:45 - course first of all I'm going to give it
100:47 - a padding from the top side a padding of
100:49 - 10 and also from the bottom side I can
100:52 - give it a padding of like
100:53 - maybe
100:55 - four and that's it it looks
100:58 - nice the next I also can wrap this Rich
101:01 - text with a
101:06 - padding and I will give you the padding
101:08 - only from the bottom side and it will be
101:10 - something like nine and I hope it looks
101:13 - beautiful I think it does so let me just
101:16 - put a con right here and also write
101:20 - here so now I have this I have a c
101:24 - I have a display name I have this
101:25 - username subscriptions videos and also
101:28 - this text at the bottom then next I want
101:30 - to create uh actually some uh buttons
101:34 - right here which is going to be for the
101:35 - managing videos and also uh navigating
101:38 - to some other pages and it's exactly the
101:40 - same like we have in actual YouTube
101:42 - colog Let me just go ahead and create
101:44 - this so first of all I need to create a
101:47 - container and inside this container I
101:49 - want to create my
101:51 - button first of all let me let me just
101:53 - give it a decoration it has a colors of
101:56 - like gray for now
101:58 - and I'm I'm going to also give it a
102:01 - border
102:03 - radius which is going to be B radius
102:05 - from the old sides and it will be
102:06 - circular to something like nine and I
102:09 - hope it looks
102:11 - nice and I need to give it a child that
102:13 - we can actually see this container and
102:16 - the child of this container is going to
102:18 - be a text button and this text button
102:22 - has an onpress which is for now just
102:24 - empty and also it has a text to
102:28 - say manage
102:33 - videos let me just change the UI because
102:35 - it really doesn't look very uh beautiful
102:39 - for now let me just change the textel of
102:41 - this one and give it a color of like
102:51 - black and then I can just uh give this
102:54 - gray color a shed of 300 and now it
102:58 - should be like this after that I also
103:01 - want to create two more buttons in a row
103:03 - just side by side to this manage videos
103:05 - button and these two buttons are going
103:07 - to be the type image button first of all
103:10 - let me just take this
103:13 - container and first I want to have a row
103:16 - inside the row I want to have this
103:18 - container I'll say two more image
103:21 - buttons and if you just want wonder that
103:23 - what is this image button uh I should
103:26 - say that it is a pre-u fidget that I
103:27 - have already created and of course it's
103:30 - inside the starting project and
103:32 - basically it's just a padding widget it
103:34 - has a g detector to uh just check this
103:37 - on top and here we have just a container
103:40 - inside which I have used an asset from
103:43 - the asset folder in my project and it's
103:46 - very useful having this image button
103:49 - first of all it has an onpress of course
103:50 - it's going to be empty for now and also
103:53 - we have an image a half color which is
103:54 - going to be true for
103:56 - now and this image is going to be
103:58 - something like
104:02 - pin.png let me just check it this is the
104:04 - icon that I have
104:06 - created I'm going to just copy this one
104:09 - more time and the next icon I mean the
104:12 - asset is going to be just time watched.
104:16 - PNG and as you can see this is the
104:18 - second icon having this SI about
104:21 - changing the size of this but S I can
104:23 - just wrap them with expanded widget
104:26 - first of all starting from this
104:28 - container I'm going to just wrap it with
104:30 - expanded vidget and I will give it a
104:33 - flex of three and this F just specify
104:36 - the size of this child of this expanded
104:38 - widget I'm going to also just wrap this
104:41 - two B two more bottons with expanded
104:43 - fidget I'm not going to just specify the
104:48 - legs and this is the final one and as
104:51 - you can see it looks much beautiful
104:52 - right now I just need to change the
104:54 - height of this manage videos button so
104:57 - let me just come here inside the
104:59 - container I can just change the height
105:01 - property to something like maybe
105:04 - 40 and I need to give it something like
105:07 - 44 I
105:11 - believe or it should be like 41 I have
105:14 - it matches and I think that's perfect I
105:18 - don't need to change it anymore I also
105:20 - want to get that color from this image
105:22 - button
105:23 - you know the color of this button is
105:25 - just something like soft blue background
105:28 - let me just implement this inside the
105:31 - manage vide Button as well and instead
105:33 - of this we can just have this one and I
105:35 - will also have to import
105:38 - it and this soft blue uh this soft blue
105:42 - gray background is just a color which I
105:44 - have already created inside this files
105:46 - colors and of course it's inside the
105:48 - instarting
105:49 - project and it's going to be very useful
105:52 - throughout this project these colors so
105:55 - now we have everything and as you can
105:56 - see this is how it looks like I just
105:57 - need to wrap this row with a padding and
105:59 - give it a padding from the top side so
106:02 - let me just do
106:08 - it we will have a padding from the top
106:11 - side and it's going to be a padding of
106:13 - 10 I believe so I can just increase the
106:16 - uh I mean this pading to something like
106:19 - 16 which makes it much more beautiful
106:21 - okay let's go to the final part which is
106:24 - going to be adding a tab bar and a tab
106:26 - bar view here so first of all I'm going
106:28 - to just add a tab bar here so let me
106:31 - just scroll down and outside of this row
106:34 - and a padding I can just create the tab
106:38 - bar I also do a comment here can
106:40 - understand that I have created a tab bar
106:42 - right here and I have can I can just use
106:45 - the P belt widget from the flutter
106:47 - itself which is the tab bar and to use
106:49 - this tab bar and tab bar view inside
106:51 - flutter first of all you need to have a
106:53 - controller and I'm going to just use the
106:56 - default controller so what I can do is
106:58 - to just take all this scaffold let me
107:02 - just take all of them and I need to
107:04 - return first of all a default tab
107:07 - controller and using this default tab
107:09 - controller I can just specify like I
107:12 - want to have seven tabs here and the
107:14 - child is going to be just my whole
107:16 - project now I can use this tab bar to
107:19 - create it and the first and the only I
107:22 - mean the only required parameter inside
107:25 - this tab bar is a tab so you need to
107:27 - have just specify all the tabs that you
107:29 - want to create and tabs that I want to
107:31 - create the first one is the home let me
107:34 - just copy and paste it some more times I
107:37 - want to have seven tabs so I'm going to
107:40 - just need to create six more of these
107:42 - tabs the next one is
107:44 - videos the next one is
107:48 - shorts community
107:57 - playlists channels and the final is
108:01 - about so this is just extra I'm going to
108:03 - remove it and now we have this t board
108:06 - but when I see the emulator it's really
108:08 - not looking very beautiful so I need to
108:10 - change some properties inside this tabbo
108:13 - to make it much more beautiful and the
108:15 - first one which is more important is
108:17 - this is scrollable right now that it's
108:19 - looking like this it's because it's not
108:21 - scrollable and makes it it will look
108:23 - like this but if I just uh change this
108:26 - scrollable to true now it looks like
108:28 - this which is much more beautiful but
108:31 - I'm going to also add some more
108:32 - properties uh some more properties to
108:34 - this stb to make it much more beautiful
108:36 - further than this uh first of all let's
108:39 - just add a label style which is going to
108:42 - be the type text
108:44 - style and I will just change the F size
108:47 - to
108:48 - 15 and I also want to just give it a f w
108:53 - of
108:56 - w500 so I will just use this fway
109:02 - 500 I will also want to change the
109:04 - indicator size so let me just change it
109:07 - real quick and the indicator size is
109:09 - going to be just the tab bar indicator
109:13 - size. level good and the indicator
109:17 - padding is the next property which I'm
109:19 - going to just give it a padding from the
109:21 - top side and
109:24 - 12 very good I believe that's enough for
109:27 - now and if it's necessary I'm going to
109:28 - also add some more properties to this
109:31 - tab bar and right now it should be much
109:33 - more beautiful I just need to just wrap
109:36 - the whole tab bar with a padding to give
109:38 - it a padding from the bottom I mean from
109:40 - the top
109:44 - side and I would have a padding of like
109:46 - 14 in from the top
109:50 - side okay and this is what we got for
109:52 - now and I believe it's much more
109:54 - beautiful now that we have this tab bar
109:57 - let's also add a tab bar view which is
109:59 - basically the pages that we need uh
110:02 - inside each tab as you can see if I
110:04 - scroll between different tabs right now
110:06 - nothing changes there's no Pages let's
110:09 - add that one as well so just above this
110:12 - padding and tab bar I can just create
110:15 - this tab bar View and it got a children
110:19 - property which is required and I just
110:21 - need to add seven children for each of
110:24 - these tabs that we have so let's just
110:26 - create them one by
110:28 - one I'm going to just create a center
110:30 - vet which has a child of this text which
110:33 - is going to be again the same names that
110:36 - we had before and I will just copy it
110:39 - six more times that we can use in this
110:42 - tab view the next one is going to be
110:46 - videos
110:49 - shorts community
110:58 - playlist Channel and the final one is
111:00 - going to be
111:02 - about very good now let me just do it a
111:05 - cons here and right now uh let me just
111:09 - wrap this tab view with expanded widget
111:12 - we got some UI
111:14 - error now everything should be good and
111:17 - when I just scroll into different tabs
111:20 - the page changes now I'm inside the
111:22 - video use tab and the shorts Community
111:26 - playlist and everything so on and so
111:28 - forth so now it's looking much more
111:30 - beautiful so I believe that we have a
111:32 - really good UI till now so before going
111:36 - into the logic and adding the logic to
111:39 - actually display the actual data of the
111:42 - current user let me just uh modify and
111:45 - organize my code as you can see there
111:48 - are a lot of code inside this page we
111:49 - have 152 lines of code and I leave it
111:52 - some it's somehow messy so I'm going to
111:56 - just put some of this uh you know
111:59 - widgets inside a different file and it's
112:02 - going to be parts of this file let me
112:06 - just show you what I really mean first
112:08 - of all we have all these widgets from
112:10 - starting from the circle lator up to
112:13 - this more about this channel up to this
112:16 - right here and it's all about the users
112:21 - data like perfect picture display name
112:23 - username and everything so I can just uh
112:26 - you know add it inside a separate file
112:29 - which is going to be my vidget top
112:31 - header because it's the top header of my
112:32 - page so I'm going to just go let me just
112:35 - close this off
112:38 - and inside my channel I can add a new
112:42 - folder which I can just call parts and
112:45 - inside this folder I will put the
112:47 - different parts of my pages like my
112:49 - channel screen pages I divide them into
112:51 - different parts and put it right here
112:53 - which makes my code much morean
112:56 - organizable and the first file is as I
112:58 - said is going to be top
113:02 - header let me just UT the material the
113:07 - dart create an status widget which I'm
113:10 - going to just call it top header
113:13 - widget actually it's not a widget it's
113:15 - just top header because it's part of my
113:17 - screen and here at first I'm going to
113:20 - just return a colum and then I can paste
113:24 - all the quit right
113:26 - here now inside this my channel screen
113:30 - instead of all that good I can just you
113:33 - know use this top header right here just
113:37 - import it and use it right inside the my
113:40 - channel screen and as you can see the UI
113:42 - is just exactly the same there's no
113:44 - changes and I can exactly do the same to
113:48 - this you know tab bar and tab bar view
113:51 - let me just copy this on a as well this
113:53 - tab
113:54 - bar and right here I can create a new
113:57 - file which I can just call it tab
114:01 - bar and here I'm going to just call it
114:04 - tab bar widget again not
114:08 - widget you know I can just call it page
114:11 - tab bar and I will just paste it inside
114:15 - this instead of this placeholder very
114:17 - good now let me just use it inside this
114:20 - screen
114:26 - and the final one is going to be just
114:28 - this tab bar
114:30 - view a new file which I can just call it
114:34 - uh Tabb bar
114:38 - View and I can just call it page know
114:42 - tabs and actually let me just rename
114:45 - this to top pages you know it gives more
114:49 - meaning to say top pages and I can just
114:52 - return this one as well right here and
114:55 - let me just use it inside my channel
115:01 - screen and that's it now my code is much
115:05 - more recognizable I have a tab pages
115:07 - right here I have a tab bar and also I
115:10 - have some buttons here and here I also
115:13 - have this top header actually I can just
115:17 - put this buttons as well inside a
115:19 - separate file so it's starting from this
115:21 - padding up to right here I can just copy
115:24 - all the code and create a new part which
115:27 - is going to be
115:30 - buttons again UT the material. dart
115:33 - create an status fidget which I'm going
115:35 - to call it
115:38 - buttons and that's it of buttons here
115:41 - just return a
115:43 - column and inside this column I can have
115:45 - all this widgets you have to import this
115:48 - one as well and now we don't have any
115:50 - error also import this one
115:54 - very good and now I can use this buttons
115:56 - right
116:01 - here and as you can see uh let me just
116:04 - remove this const because I can just put
116:07 - a const the whole page right
116:10 - now and as you can see right now the
116:13 - code is much more organized I have a my
116:15 - channel screen here I have a top header
116:18 - which I just show my uh user data I have
116:22 - but which I have three buttons inside
116:24 - the row I have a tab a page tabbo and
116:27 - also tab pages and as you can see the UI
116:30 - is exactly the same and there is no
116:32 - difference here now that you are done
116:34 - here let me just add the most important
116:37 - part it means adding the actual data
116:41 - from server and placing just inside this
116:45 - different widgets so what I want to do
116:48 - right now is to use that future provider
116:52 - that I just created and add the data and
116:54 - put the data inside different widgets in
116:56 - this screen and to do that I can just
116:59 - change the whole St widget to a consumer
117:04 - widget and as you know I have to add a
117:07 - widget RI into the the belt function
117:10 - okay right now instead of returning this
117:14 - default tab controller let me just take
117:18 - everything I need to use this rev and
117:21 - then I can use the watch method to watch
117:24 - a method and what I'm going to just
117:25 - watch is the current user data provider
117:28 - which you already know that it's a
117:30 - future provider let me just hover over
117:32 - it and you can see it's a type future
117:34 - provider of a user model and now once
117:37 - again like we just saw inside the
117:39 - homepage I can just use the the win
117:41 - method which is a special method which
117:43 - again allow me to handle situation on
117:46 - different cases like the data error and
117:48 - loading and we're exactly going to do
117:51 - the same once again again if we have the
117:54 - loading I just want to show a loader
117:57 - pitch if we got any error I just want
118:02 - to show an error pitch and finally when
118:06 - we have the data I just want to show
118:09 - everything which I had really good and
118:12 - as you can see the data is the current
118:14 - user once
118:16 - again using this current user I can just
118:19 - put the actual data inside each of these
118:21 - pages first of all I'm going to go
118:23 - inside this top header and create a
118:25 - parameter here which is going to be the
118:27 - type user
118:33 - model and I can just place this user
118:36 - model into actual qu first of all let me
118:39 - just change the circle
118:40 - aor and we have a background image once
118:43 - again I'm going to use this cached
118:46 - Network image provider and I can use the
118:48 - user. purple Peck to add the value right
118:51 - here remove the cons and everything
118:53 - should be good the next one is the
118:55 - display name I can again use this user.
118:58 - display name to show the display name of
119:01 - the current
119:03 - user the next one is going to be for the
119:05 - username number of subscriptions and
119:07 - also videos let me just place them each
119:10 - one of them
119:12 - user do username this is the first one
119:16 - the next one is number of subscriptions
119:18 - so I can just say once again
119:22 - user.
119:24 - subscriptions and after that I'm going
119:26 - to just say it is number of
119:29 - subscriptions just to tell the users
119:31 - that it's about subscriptions because
119:33 - this one is just giving us it's just
119:36 - giving us a number like if the
119:38 - subscriptions is equal to zero which is
119:40 - which is equal to zero initially it will
119:43 - just give us a zero but I also want to
119:44 - show subscriptions which just tell the
119:46 - user that it's about subscriptions and
119:48 - the next one is about videos so I can
119:50 - just say user videos and
119:55 - videos okay now inside my channel screen
119:59 - I have this error because it wants this
120:01 - user which is going to be equal to
120:04 - current
120:05 - user let me just remove this
120:09 - const
120:14 - okay and let me just check what we have
120:17 - as you can see I have this data actually
120:20 - my
120:22 - display name is not really looking very
120:23 - nice but the other information is good
120:25 - the information is completely correct
120:27 - this is my display name which I'm going
120:29 - to just change it this is the username
120:32 - diff coder this is number of
120:34 - subscriptions which is giving me an
120:35 - empty list so let me just change it real
120:37 - quick I don't want to have a list I want
120:40 - to have the actual data so I can use
120:43 - this user. subscriptions do length
120:47 - actually and it will just give me the
120:49 - number of uh length of this list of
120:52 - subscriptions and right now it's giving
120:54 - me zero subscriptions and zero
120:57 - videos so everything is perfectly
121:00 - working fine and we have shown all the
121:02 - data inside this
121:04 - page the next I also need to create a
121:07 - new page for settings Channel I need to
121:11 - create a page which I inside that I can
121:13 - just change some of the settings inside
121:15 - my screen like display name username
121:18 - description and all of this I need to be
121:21 - able to change it on as well so first of
121:24 - all let me just close all the saved
121:26 - pages and then I can just
121:29 - go and create a new page which is called
121:33 - channel
121:38 - settings just import the material.
121:41 - dart and create an status fidget
121:45 - called my channel
121:49 - settings okay that's great the next I
121:53 - need to have a scapel just like always
121:55 - and then inside the body I want to have
121:57 - a sephara inside which I want to have a
122:02 - padding and once again we'll have a
122:04 - padding only from the top side which is
122:07 - going to be a pading of
122:10 - 20 and then inside the child I have this
122:14 - column okay everything is good up to
122:18 - now so now inside this column I want to
122:21 - create my settings Channel which is
122:24 - going to be just first of all I need to
122:26 - show once again the profile picture
122:29 - inside a circle a and
122:31 - then I can show my display name username
122:35 - and description and here we don't want
122:37 - to just display this information we want
122:40 - to be able to change this information so
122:42 - I want to enable user to edit the users
122:47 - data like users will be able to edit
122:49 - username edit display name and edit this
122:53 - description so let's just create each
122:55 - one of
122:56 - them uh the first I just need to create
123:00 - actually an stack widget okay first of
123:03 - all ins the children I can create an
123:05 - asset
123:07 - image and it's going to be inside the
123:09 - assets and the first one is the flut
123:14 - background.png
123:16 - let me just run the emulator once again
123:19 - and we can see how does it look like
123:29 - I will just once again minimize this V
123:32 - code that you can see inul lat and I
123:34 - just need to go to men. Dart and again
123:37 - because we are working on the UI I will
123:39 - change this my channel screen to the
123:41 - screen that I am building which is going
123:43 - to be channel
123:50 - settings okay
123:53 - great now inside here the first thing
123:56 - that I had to show was a flut background
124:00 - and actually it's not inside the assets
124:02 - it's inside assets and then images and
124:05 - then I have this asset flut
124:06 - background.png and I just want to show
124:09 - this as a background image for my uh
124:13 - project and my
124:14 - channel and first of all let me just
124:17 - remove this uh you know padding because
124:20 - we don't need to have a padding from the
124:21 - top side side and it's just want to be
124:23 - just stick to the top of the
124:26 - pitch about the height I also need to
124:28 - change the height of this asset image so
124:31 - let me just wrap it with a size
124:36 - box and change the height to something
124:39 - like 200
124:41 - pixel or should I make it just smaller
124:44 - to something like
124:46 - 170 and I just need to change the fit
124:50 - property inside this image to box fit do
124:53 - cover and it will just cover the whole
124:55 - page for me first of all let me also
124:57 - change the WID to double do
125:00 - infinity and now everything is great
125:04 - then inside this background I also want
125:07 - to add my perect picture right at this
125:10 - you know at the center of this
125:11 - background right here I want to show my
125:13 - perect picture so I can just create
125:16 - another widget inside this
125:19 - stack uh widget which I'm going just
125:22 - create a circle AAR inside which I want
125:25 - to show my profile
125:27 - picture the radius is going to be just
125:29 - something like 20
125:33 - background color
125:36 - gray and it's like that and I'm going to
125:39 - just wrap it with a position to change
125:42 - the position of this circle AAR I will
125:45 - give it a position from the left side I
125:47 - want to have a padding or I can say a
125:49 - distance of 50 pixel
125:52 - let me add some more like
125:57 - 120 you can just uh use trials and
126:00 - errors to find the perfect spot for
126:02 - yourself and also I'm going to do the
126:04 - same for the top which is going to be
126:06 - first of all 80 or it's a lot let me
126:09 - just use
126:11 - 65 and that's perfect I will also uh
126:14 - change this bar you know the radius of
126:16 - the Circ water to 30 I want to make it
126:19 - bigger and change this to
126:22 - XD and right now I maybe it's okay and
126:26 - you can as I said you can just use
126:27 - trials and errors to find the perfect
126:29 - spot the perfect place for the circle
126:31 - over here it's all about what we
126:34 - did and right now it's just a blue gray
126:38 - uh right now it's just a gray color but
126:39 - later on I will add the profile picture
126:42 - right inside the circle over and
126:44 - actually I also want to add a camera
126:47 - image right here I need again this
126:50 - position and the child is going to be an
126:53 - asset image once again and I will use
126:56 - assets and then I will go inside icons
127:00 - and then I'm going to use this
127:06 - camera.png it's an icon which I have
127:08 - inside my access folder and it's the
127:11 - icon that I need first of all let me
127:14 - just change the height to something like
127:16 - 30 maybe I want to make it much smaller
127:20 - uh something like 38
127:22 - or 34 that should be perfect and I can
127:27 - also change the color to
127:31 - white and finally I just need to change
127:35 - the position so I wanted the position to
127:37 - be something like it has a 10 pixel
127:40 - distance from the right side or should I
127:42 - increase it to 60 and also I want it to
127:45 - have some distance from the top
127:47 - something like 20 maybe that's great or
127:50 - maybe 10
127:52 - and that's now I believe
127:55 - beautiful and later on we can use this
127:58 - to change the profile picture and we
128:01 - will see how we can do it okay this was
128:04 - the top of my page the next I want to
128:06 - add some more stuff to this page which
128:09 - is going to
128:11 - be uh some item widgets in which I can
128:14 - just change my display name my username
128:17 - and also description and it's all about
128:20 - the V that I have here so I have this
128:23 - settings item I believe I can use this
128:27 - settings item to just create that rows
128:31 - which allow me to change display name
128:33 - and username and everything so let's use
128:36 - the settings item let's get back to the
128:38 - channel settings and write after the
128:40 - Stag widget inside the column uh I'm
128:43 - going to just write a comment to say the
128:45 - second part which just specify for me
128:49 - that where are we right now and right
128:52 - here I will create this settings item
128:54 - and of course import it and as you can
128:57 - see it has some required parameters and
128:59 - I identifier onpress and value the
129:02 - identifier for the for the first one is
129:03 - going to be just name because we're
129:06 - creating a name the onpress is going to
129:08 - be just empty for now and the value is
129:11 - going to be something like ah I mean my
129:15 - name actually my display name and this
129:17 - is created right
129:19 - here I want to create some more of this
129:22 - so let me create this one as well the
129:25 - second one is going to be for the
129:27 - username so I will give it it I I will
129:29 - give it an identifier of handle and my
129:32 - username is going to be Ahmed amini it's
129:36 - just hard Cod it now and the last one is
129:39 - about
129:42 - description and description is going to
129:44 - be empty for now because when users
129:47 - create their account for the first time
129:48 - they have no description but later on
129:51 - they can add their description and we
129:53 - will add this functionality as well now
129:56 - let me just add some size box between
130:00 - them and it has a height of something
130:03 - like 60
130:07 - maybe or 14 that's going to be
130:11 - completely enough for this
130:13 - one so now we have this name handle and
130:16 - description and it's looking I believe
130:19 - beautiful I just need to add add
130:22 - an a size box right here as well because
130:25 - I wanted to have some distance from the
130:27 - top of the pitch so right now everything
130:29 - is correct and I also want to add some
130:32 - more widgets at the end of this column
130:35 - which is going to be the first one a row
130:37 - let me just create a row as children and
130:40 - inside this children I can first of all
130:42 - create a text to
130:45 - say keep all my subscribers private
130:53 - I'm just creating this because it's
130:55 - actually inside the actual YouTube and
130:59 - the next I also want to create a
131:03 - switch uh widget and the value is for
131:07 - now true and it has an unchanged which
131:09 - has the value and I will just say why
131:12 - what is the switch and how can we use
131:15 - it actually this is the switch I just
131:18 - want to be able to have this one as well
131:20 - in my project say
131:22 - uh keep all my subscribers private and
131:24 - users can just change this pattern or
131:26 - this switch true or false they can
131:28 - change it and for doing it first of
131:32 - all let me just have the full
131:35 - screen uh instead of just putting it
131:37 - true and as the value of the switch I
131:39 - can actually make it more Dynamic first
131:43 - of all let me just change this this
131:44 - widget this stess wiget into a stateful
131:47 - vget and then I can create a
131:50 - Boolean just called uh I can call this
131:53 - bran as something like uh is
131:57 - Switched I'm going to call it like this
131:59 - and initially it will be equal to false
132:01 - because we don't want this switch to be
132:03 - true initially and then instead of this
132:06 - true I can just give it this value of
132:08 - this Boolean which is a switched and
132:11 - whenever this unchanged property inside
132:13 - the switch triggers that means whenever
132:15 - the user changes this switch I want the
132:19 - value of this unchanged to go inside the
132:22 - is switch so I will put and insert the
132:27 - value of a value which is the value of
132:30 - this switch inside the is switch and uh
132:33 - later on I can just do a c set
132:35 - everything should be perfectly
132:38 - fine and let me also change the UI of
132:40 - this uh first of all I need to give it a
132:43 - main AIS
132:45 - alignment to space between
132:52 - and I can just wrap it with a padding
132:56 - widget from the left Ed and also from
132:59 - the right it will be
133:00 - it and that's looking perfectly
133:04 - fine okay that's great and the last I
133:08 - also want to add a text at the end of my
133:10 - page at the bottom of my
133:12 - page so let me create a text here to
133:16 - just say changes made on your names and
133:21 - profile pictures are visible only to
133:26 - YouTube and not other Google services so
133:32 - it's just a text that we already have in
133:35 - the actual YouTube so I'm going to just
133:36 - add it here there is no purpose for
133:38 - adding it but I just want it to be or I
133:41 - can say it want I want it to have a more
133:43 - beautiful UI so I add this one as
133:48 - well uh as this just this text I just
133:53 - need to change the text align and also
133:55 - give it some
133:57 - padding so first of all let me just give
133:59 - it a text align which is going to
134:02 - be text align do
134:04 - Center and I will also wrap this with a
134:09 - padding a padding from the left I can
134:12 - see just a padding symmetric and
134:16 - horizontal
134:18 - 10 and this is actually how it looks
134:21 - like I will also change the background
134:24 - color I mean the color of this T so
134:27 - let's just change the
134:28 - style and I will give it a color of
134:31 - something like
134:36 - gray and not actually gray but I can
134:39 - give it a color of blue gray I believe
134:42 - this is more beautiful and everything is
134:45 - per perfectly fine it's
134:49 - great let me just give it also a
134:52 - vertical padding and give it a a padding
134:55 - of 4 in or I just just increase it to
134:58 - something like
135:00 - 20 okay this is my settings Channel page
135:03 - inside which I can just change my
135:05 - display name my user name and also the
135:07 - description the UI is complete now and
135:10 - what I can work on right now is just the
135:13 - adding the logic and functionality to
135:16 - see the profile picture right here and
135:18 - then be able to change and edit this
135:19 - username this will name and everything
135:22 - so before this we saw that how can we
135:25 - convert an set this fidget into a
135:27 - consumer vget and we also saw that how
135:29 - can we create a consumer widget inside
135:31 - an scaffold without just changing all
135:34 - the whole St list or stold widget but
135:36 - now I want to convert a stateful widget
135:38 - into a consumer widget and for doing it
135:40 - you just need to uh you know add a
135:43 - consumer before a stateful vet and then
135:46 - let me just import this FL R part to
135:48 - this file and then copy consumer you
135:52 - also need to paste it right here before
135:54 - this set here and also here and right
135:57 - now the all errors are gone and you can
135:59 - just use a consumer inside your stateful
136:01 - widgets and you don't have to just
136:04 - create a riff by yourself because you
136:06 - already have access to this RI let me
136:08 - just show it somewhere for example
136:10 - inside this I can just have access to
136:12 - this R and I can use for example this
136:13 - red method it's already M for
136:16 - me so now let's go and create the logic
136:20 - to first of all add the current user
136:24 - data first of all for this you know P
136:28 - for picture because I wanted to show it
136:30 - right there and also there and there
136:34 - so once again like I did before I can
136:37 - just take the whole
136:39 - scaffold let me just take the
136:42 - whole
136:47 - scaffold and I can use ref doat
136:51 - and once again I'm us using the current
136:54 - user data
136:56 - provider and using this way method if
137:00 - the data is loading I will show a
137:05 - loader also for the error one I will
137:09 - show an error
137:12 - page and when we have the data I
137:15 - actually want to show all this widgets
137:17 - and everything here
137:28 - okay so now this data is once again the
137:32 - current user and I can just use it to
137:35 - display my data first of all I need to
137:38 - change the background image of this
137:40 - circle aor I will create this background
137:42 - image once again using this cached
137:44 - Network image provider and the URL is
137:47 - going to be the current user. profile
137:50 - picture
137:51 - let me just remove this cons and
137:53 - everything is
137:55 - good it should show and as you can see
137:57 - this is my profile picture and it's
137:58 - showing well right
138:00 - here the next I also want to change my
138:03 - display name right here let me just take
138:06 - this and use the current
138:08 - user do display name the next one is the
138:13 - username so I will do exactly the same
138:15 - but I will change the display name to
138:18 - username
138:23 - and the next one is about
138:25 - descriptions I will again use this one
138:29 - but
138:31 - description
138:33 - okay I believe everything is done so I
138:36 - have my perer picture my display name
138:38 - username and also this
138:41 - descriptions and it is done but the next
138:44 - I want to be able to edit this what I
138:46 - mean is whenever the user clicks on this
138:49 - pen uh button whenever the user click on
138:53 - it they should be able to just you know
138:56 - change or edit their display name
138:58 - username and descriptions so how can I
139:00 - do it inside this onpress for the first
139:04 - one is going to be the display name so
139:05 - let's add how can we just edit display
139:08 - name I need to create this so I will
139:10 - have a comment here so let me just
139:13 - create a new folder called repository
139:15 - inside inside my channel and here I need
139:19 - to create create a file which is going
139:23 - to be
139:24 - just maybe edit fields. Dart and right
139:29 - here I can just create a class called
139:34 - edit
139:36 - settings
139:38 - fil and again I need to have access to
139:41 - the Firebase fire and also Firebase off
139:43 - let me just create them the first one is
139:45 - Firebase firer so I will have an inance
139:48 - of fire Reser and the next one is going
139:50 - to be for the Firebase o and then I can
139:53 - just generate Constructor for it the
139:55 - first method inside this class is going
139:57 - to be the edit display
140:00 - name of course it's an inst method and
140:03 - here we want to be able to edit the
140:05 - display name and I need this display
140:08 - name as a parameter here so I'm going to
140:10 - just write display name it will be used
140:13 - as parameter and what I want to do is to
140:16 - just go inside the fur and then the
140:18 - collection of users
140:21 - the doc is going to be just the current
140:23 - user uid so I'm going to use the alt.
140:25 - current
140:27 - user uid and then I will just update and
140:31 - what I want to update is the display
140:33 - name because we want to edit that field
140:36 - so I'm going to just go inside display
140:38 - name and I want to just update it to the
140:42 - new display name which is going to be
140:43 - this display name which we have as
140:46 - parameter let me just create uh some
140:49 - more of this because so I need to do the
140:51 - same for a username and also
140:54 - descriptions the next one is going to be
140:56 - edit
140:59 - username and also we have the edit
141:05 - description here we have the username
141:08 - and also the
141:09 - username here we have the
141:17 - description okay everything is perfect
141:20 - okay let me just create a provider out
141:23 - of this and again it's going to be just
141:25 - a simple provider and we already know
141:27 - that how can you create this
141:30 - providers this is going to be just
141:32 - called
141:33 - edit settings provider again equal to
141:37 - simple provider and I can just return
141:40 - this edit settings filed I just need to
141:42 - initialize this firer and also Fest out
141:53 - okay everything
141:55 - is
141:58 - right and now I can just use this edit
142:01 - settings provider to access this
142:05 - class okay now I want to just use this
142:09 - to uh you
142:11 - know create this functionality to edit
142:14 - the display name and here I can use my
142:17 - second widget which I already created
142:20 - which is is going to be the settings
142:22 - dialogue so whenever this uh onpress is
142:27 - triggered first of all I want to show a
142:29 - dialogue and then inside the Builder I
142:32 - want to return this settings dialogue
142:37 - okay it's great and as you can see
142:39 - inside the settings dialogue I have an
142:42 - identifier let me just see what I need
142:44 - to do I have to go and get to that edit
142:49 - fils provider and then I can access to
142:52 - this edit display name
142:55 - actually so I want to have this method
142:59 - and when do I really need to use the
143:02 - this display name
143:04 - is
143:06 - whenever yeah we have an identifier
143:09 - which I can just give it something like
143:11 - display
143:12 - name and the next property is just
143:16 - onsave and this onsave has a display
143:19 - name and this like this and right here I
143:22 - can use this RI to edit display name and
143:26 - this uh parameter that I need to fill
143:29 - inside this Ed display name which is my
143:31 - display name the new display name is
143:33 - going to be just this
143:35 - name and everything is working perfectly
143:38 - fine and if you just get confused that
143:41 - what I I what I exactly did here I'm
143:43 - going to just uh go through it once
143:46 - again so don't worry before that let me
143:48 - just finish these two adds for the the
143:50 - username and also description as well
143:52 - and then I'm going to just uh tell you
143:54 - that what I
143:56 - did let me just copy
144:00 - everything and I will paste the same for
144:02 - the
144:03 - username but I just need to change this
144:06 - to
144:06 - username I need to use this edit
144:09 - username again
144:14 - username and also change this one to
144:18 - username okay
144:21 - and I will also do the same for the
144:23 - description I just need to change this
144:27 - to
144:35 - description this one and also this
144:45 - one okay now it should be working so
144:49 - let's see what exactly we did first of
144:51 - all I just created this uh settings
144:54 - dialogue which is it shows it's just a
144:56 - dialogue it's just an alert dialogue
144:59 - when whenever we click on the botton I
145:01 - want to show an alert dialogue and say
145:04 - if you really want to just edit that and
145:07 - inside this alert dialog I have an
145:08 - identifier which is specify whether it's
145:10 - a display name a username or a
145:12 - description and then I have a text field
145:14 - which inside this text field the user is
145:16 - able to enter the new uh display name
145:20 - user usern name of description and I
145:21 - just get access to that using this
145:24 - controller and finally I have this uh
145:27 - you know cancel button which just
145:29 - navigate back and also the save button
145:32 - which allow me to just save everything
145:34 - and and I just pass this save uh
145:37 - function as a parameter to this channel
145:39 - settings page so what I'm doing here is
145:42 - basically to say first of all whenever
145:44 - this button is clicked show me a
145:45 - dialogue and then return the settings
145:47 - dialogue which the identifier for here
145:49 - is displaying it
145:50 - and then I have this unsave method
145:53 - whenever the user clicks on Save I want
145:55 - to access this name so this name is the
145:57 - exact new name that the user uh has
146:00 - entered inside the text field and I just
146:03 - get access to this name and I just call
146:05 - this provider edit settings and then I
146:08 - use the edit display name and as you saw
146:12 - here I just go inside the collection of
146:13 - users on the uid of the current user I
146:16 - just update the current display name the
146:19 - current
146:22 - username and also the current
146:26 - descriptions so this is all I did inside
146:30 - this page and now I have to test it out
146:34 - whether it's working or not so let me
146:36 - just run the
146:39 - project yeah it's already running so let
146:41 - me just do a h
146:43 - restart so as you can see we have this
146:46 - one my profile picture display name and
146:48 - everything and when I click on this
146:49 - button it gives me something like dialog
146:53 - and I can just enter for example my new
146:56 - display name which is going to be ahmar
147:01 - amini okay and when I click save now it
147:05 - has to change my display name so let me
147:07 - just do a hot Resort because it's not a
147:10 - stream it's a future it's not changing
147:12 - instantly but it should be
147:15 - changed yeah and as you can see this is
147:17 - my new display name and I can also do
147:19 - the same for the username and also for
147:21 - the description so let me just give it a
147:23 - new description for example hello world
147:28 - I am
147:30 - Ahmed
147:31 - amini okay let me just do a save once
147:35 - again and after doing a hot restart the
147:37 - description should be edited and this is
147:40 - my new description Hello World I'm Ahmed
147:44 - so everything is working now I have my
147:46 - channel and I have my channel settings
147:48 - and I'm able to edit my properties
147:51 - inside the current user I'm able to edit
147:53 - display name I'm able to edit username
147:56 - and also description as I said at the
147:59 - beginning of the course we have we will
148:00 - have a lot of homeworks throughout this
148:03 - tutorial and here I'm going to give you
148:05 - the first to
148:07 - homeworks the first homework is going to
148:09 - be you have to change this you have to
148:12 - create this ability and this feature
148:15 - that user can change the profile picture
148:17 - as well so as you saw I have created
148:19 - this uh little uh camera icon I want you
148:24 - to create this feature that whenever the
148:25 - user clicks on this button they should
148:28 - be able to pick a new image and change
148:30 - their profile picture I want you to do
148:33 - this and the second homework is going to
148:35 - be very easy you just need to add a
148:38 - validation to this username as you saw
148:42 - at the authentication feature whenever
148:44 - the user wants to create create a
148:46 - username uh we check whether the
148:49 - username is unique or not so all the
148:51 - validation that you saw already I want
148:54 - you to create the same validation in
148:56 - this part as well that whenever the user
148:58 - tries to addit username they should also
149:01 - check uh they should also be checked
149:03 - that if the username is validate or not
149:06 - so I want you create this two features
149:08 - and this is going to be your first
149:10 - homeworks and I hope that you can do it
149:12 - well now I want to also change this uh
149:15 - text it's not looking very nice let me
149:18 - just change it to identifier
149:20 - I want it to be something like your new
149:24 - display
149:25 - name and I will do the same for the this
149:29 - one as well I want to change to your new
149:36 - username and also for this one
149:41 - know your new
149:45 - description now let me just do a hot
149:47 - restart and when I click on this it says
149:50 - your new display name and I'm able to
149:53 - change it and if the UI is if you
149:56 - believe that the UI is not looking very
149:57 - nice maybe at the end I also change the
149:59 - UI more and you can also do it yourself
150:01 - to change the UI appropriately like the
150:04 - way you want it to be I'm not going to
150:06 - go any further so in the previous
150:08 - tutorial we saw how can we create uh the
150:11 - my channel page and we also added every
150:14 - logic and everything necessary to that
150:17 - uh creating of my channel and right now
150:20 - I want to just focus on creating user
150:22 - channel so we already have this folder
150:24 - right here and I'm going to just go
150:26 - ahead and create the pages first of all
150:28 - and inside that I have only one page
150:30 - which is going to be user Channel page
150:34 - so what you want to create inside this
150:36 - page is something really similar to my
150:39 - channel I'm going to just show a
150:41 - background image of flut background and
150:43 - then I will show profile picture display
150:45 - name username number of subscriptions
150:47 - and videos but the way that I format
150:50 - this data will be a little different
150:52 - than I did in my channel and also I will
150:55 - have a subscribe button which inside
150:57 - whenever a user clicks on that subscribe
150:59 - button we will be able to subscribe the
151:01 - user that we are inside the
151:03 - channel and also at the bottom of the
151:06 - page I will show the users videos so uh
151:10 - any video that the user or the channel
151:11 - has uploaded will be shown on their
151:14 - profile and this is what exactly I want
151:16 - to create so let's work on it and also
151:19 - remember that uh for now I will not work
151:22 - on the logic and I will not show the
151:24 - actual data of the user Channel because
151:26 - up to now we didn't have that provider
151:28 - or repository and whenever I create the
151:31 - search screen which after creating it I
151:34 - will be able to click on a user click on
151:36 - a channel and then I'll be navigated to
151:38 - this page so in that case I can actually
151:41 - show the data of this page but for now
151:43 - it will be just
151:44 - hardcoded let's create this status wiget
151:47 - and I'm going to just call it user
151:49 - Channel p
151:51 - page and just like always I will just
151:53 - use a
151:56 - scaffold inside the body I can just
151:58 - create a safe
152:01 - area child
152:04 - padding let me just give it a padding
152:07 - from the top
152:09 - side okay and the child is going to be
152:12 - just a column like
152:14 - always
152:18 - okay so now first of all the first
152:21 - fidget inside this column is going to be
152:23 - just once again an image. asset which I
152:26 - can just show uh I can go inside the
152:29 - images and then I can just use this flut
152:31 - background that we already used in the
152:34 - my channel page as well and I'm going to
152:36 - use this one right here as well let me
152:38 - just uh run the emulator that you can
152:40 - see how it's
152:48 - looking surely we will see the my
152:51 - channel page right here because I have
152:53 - put it inside the m. Dart but for now
152:56 - I'm going to again change this to user
153:02 - Channel and you notice that I'm going to
153:05 - just do it as a test mode uh it's only
153:07 - in a test mode because I want you to see
153:09 - how this UI of different pages looking
153:12 - but at the end it will be just showing
153:14 - here the homepage and I will create all
153:16 - the userflow necessary for this
153:18 - application so as you can see this is
153:20 - what we have let me just resize this V
153:22 - that you can see it properly and we can
153:24 - C faster like this and I will just
153:27 - remove actually let me just close this
153:30 - extra pages actually all the pages are
153:33 - extra except this one and I will close
153:35 - all of
153:37 - them uh let me just remove this padding
153:40 - because we don't need it right now uh I
153:42 - can just actually remove this padding
153:45 - widget and I believe it's okay and this
153:48 - is the background image after the
153:50 - background image I want to show my
153:52 - profile picture display name and
153:54 - everything so let me just create the row
153:57 - and inside the children first of all I
153:59 - will create a circle Avatar with a
154:01 - radius of like 30 and also a background
154:06 - color of
154:11 - gray and then after the circle a water I
154:14 - want to have a
154:16 - column so basically inside this column I
154:19 - want to create my display name first of
154:22 - all so let me just write this one Hamad
154:26 - amini which is going to be my display
154:27 - name and also after that I can have just
154:30 - my
154:32 - username and finally I want to use a
154:36 - rich text uh basically I just want to
154:38 - create my subscriptions and videos
154:41 - inside this Rich
154:47 - Text okay let me just uh ref format
154:50 - discode and right here first of all I
154:54 - will
154:55 - create uh the first text which is going
154:58 - to be for
155:01 - subscriptions so I will just say no
155:05 - subscriptions and I will also create
155:09 - one for videos which I can just
155:13 - say no
155:15 - videos okay that's great and this is how
155:18 - it looks like let me just give it a
155:20 - color because right now it doesn't have
155:21 - a color you can't see it and I will just
155:25 - give it a color of like blue gray let's
155:28 - see what's the problem here yeah I need
155:30 - to change it
155:31 - to
155:33 - style and basically I have put it in the
155:36 - wrong place I should do it right here so
155:39 - this is what we got up to now we got a
155:41 - circle aat and then we have display name
155:43 - username subscriptions and everything
155:46 - but of course it's not looking very nice
155:48 - so let me just work on to uh make it
155:50 - more beautiful first of all I will
155:52 - increase the radius of this circle
155:54 - Avatar something like 38 it might be
155:57 - beautiful
156:00 - and you know I can just uh give this Row
156:03 - first of all a padding from the both
156:09 - side so I will give it a padding from
156:12 - the left side 12 and also from the right
156:14 - side 12 now it looks better and also I
156:18 - will give it a padding from the top SL
156:19 - which is going to be a pattering of like
156:22 - 20 then I can just uh uh make this text
156:27 - a little bigger first of all let me just
156:28 - put a cons here and then I will also
156:30 - change the style of this display
156:35 - name and I would give it a frint size of
156:37 - something like
156:40 - 24 and also a Fint way of
156:46 - Bol and the next one is this usern name
156:50 - let me just go inside I will just copy
156:52 - everything from this one but I won't
156:56 - really touch this F size I will give it
156:58 - a f size of turn actually I want to make
157:00 - it a smaller and this one is going to be
157:03 - like
157:05 - this okay and I will also give it a
157:08 - color like a color of blue gray may be
157:13 - beautiful yeah that's great and I can
157:16 - just copy the same text style for this
157:20 - one as well and right now it's looking
157:23 - much more beautiful right let me just
157:25 - put some cons
157:27 - here
157:29 - MH and inside this column or I should
157:33 - say I want to bring this usern name at
157:36 - starting of this column inside this
157:38 - column I can just change this cross
157:40 - access alignment to something like
157:43 - start and right now it's great and let's
157:47 - give it you know a padding from I need
157:52 - to give a padding to this display name
157:54 - username and also this number of
157:56 - subscriptions first of all let me just
157:59 - add a padding to this
158:02 - column and it will be just a padding
158:04 - from the left side I
158:07 - believe and I will give it a padding of
158:09 - like
158:11 - 12 and I believe it nice so this is
158:15 - going to be our page we have a circle
158:17 - aatar we have a display name username
158:19 - number of subscriptions and videos let
158:21 - me just also create some spaces here
158:24 - between this new subscriptions and new
158:27 - videos okay that's great the next I want
158:31 - to add a subscribe button in which we
158:33 - will be able to subscribe this uh
158:36 - particular user so let me just create
158:38 - this one as well outside of this padding
158:42 - outside of this row I will just go ahead
158:45 - and create a flat
158:47 - button and this t should be just
158:50 - something like subscribe all
158:56 - capitalized the unpress is going to be
158:59 - empty for now because I didn't have
159:00 - anything to write but later on I will
159:02 - fill it out and I will make user be able
159:05 - to just subscribe user when they click
159:07 - on this particular button and let me
159:10 - just uh make this column cross access
159:13 - alignment equal to
159:15 - stretch okay and it will just make wider
159:19 - this flat button at the end of my page
159:21 - and I can just give it some padding as
159:28 - well first of all from the top side a
159:31 - padding of
159:32 - 20 and also maybe I can give it a
159:35 - padding from the left side and also the
159:37 - right side and right now it should look
159:40 - beautiful so this is our page up to now
159:42 - we have a background image of flut and
159:44 - then we have this information circular
159:47 - water inside which I will show the
159:48 - purple picture display name username
159:51 - number of subscriptions and videos and
159:52 - also we have a button which enable users
159:54 - to subscribe this particular Channel and
159:58 - then at the bottom of the page I also
160:00 - want to have something like some wigets
160:02 - to show the videos of this particular
160:05 - user so what I really mean is just uh
160:07 - let me just come at the bottom of the
160:09 - page outside of this padding I want to
160:12 - make a condition to say if there is
160:15 - videos inside this page I will show the
160:18 - videos and if there is not I will just
160:20 - share something like no video inside
160:22 - this channel so let me just create this
160:25 - and later on I can add this
160:26 - functionality using this you know
160:29 - whether we have videos or not because
160:31 - when we want to create the actual when I
160:33 - when I display the actual data which
160:36 - videos is also part of them I can just
160:38 - create this condition that if the user.
160:40 - videos is not equal to zero I can show
160:43 - the videos and if it is equal to zero I
160:44 - can just show a text to say no video but
160:47 - for now I can do it just using a
160:50 - Boolean so I'm going to just create a
160:52 - Boolean to say is you
160:55 - know have have
160:58 - videos and it will be equal to false
161:01 - initially and later on when I have the
161:03 - actual data I will just remove this
161:05 - Boolean and use the actual data of
161:07 - videos but for now just to add this
161:09 - functionality I'm doing it manually and
161:11 - at the bottom of the page after this
161:13 - pading I will say if have videos is
161:17 - equal to true in that case is I want to
161:20 - show the actual videos so for now it's
161:22 - going to be just a size box because I
161:24 - don't have the actual videos when I have
161:26 - it I will show the actual videos and if
161:29 - you don't have the actual videos I just
161:31 - want to show a text to say no video this
161:35 - is what I want to have and for now as
161:37 - you can see we have this no videos I
161:39 - just need to change the style to wrap it
161:42 - with a widget first of
161:44 - all I will wrap it with the center to
161:47 - bring it at the center of the page and I
161:50 - will also change the styling of this
161:55 - text let me just give it a fin size of
161:58 - like
162:01 - 23 and also already make it
162:09 - bold okay that looks great let me just
162:11 - increase this uh Fint size something
162:14 - like 26 or maybe
162:17 - 24 and will also want it to be right
162:20 - here not there so I can maybe add a
162:24 - spacer or also I can add
162:27 - padding actually I could just use
162:28 - padding I believe so let me just wrap
162:31 - this with a padding
162:36 - widget and I will give it a padding only
162:39 - from the top side and I will use just a
162:40 - media quy which makes our code match
162:44 - responsive and it will be just the same
162:46 - in all the screens and I will use hide
162:48 - here and I will just say that ad is
162:51 - pading from like
162:54 - 0.0% of this
162:56 - page and actually maybe it's really a
162:59 - lot so let me just use 0.2 and it's
163:02 - perfect so now we have all the UI
163:05 - completed we have a background image and
163:07 - then we have shown this data the profile
163:10 - picture and everything and then we are
163:11 - able to subscribe the user and then we
163:13 - wanted to be able to show all the users
163:16 - video here but if the channel doesn't
163:18 - have any video I will just show text to
163:20 - say no video and for now it's just all
163:23 - hardcoded and once I have the actual
163:25 - data I will create uh and display all
163:28 - the data inside this
163:32 - page so right now that we are done with
163:35 - the authentication and also the channel
163:36 - feature and I can just show and display
163:38 - every single data of the users and also
163:41 - my Channel I want to work on the next
163:44 - feature which is going to be the upload
163:45 - feature I wanted to enable user to
163:48 - upload any video to the channel on F
163:50 - screen and doing that first of all I
163:53 - need to create a bottom navigation bar
163:55 - inside the homepage so right now this is
163:57 - the homepage and I want to have a bottom
164:00 - navigation bar right here at the bottom
164:02 - so let me just open this
164:05 - homepage and at the end of this page I
164:07 - can just have this bottom navigation bar
164:10 - property and the bottom navigation that
164:12 - I want to create in this project is
164:14 - going to be the Google nav bar and we
164:17 - have a package for that let me just show
164:19 - I have already installed this
164:21 - package and this is the package Google
164:24 - Navar just make sure to install the
164:25 - latest version of this package and using
164:28 - this package I can create a very
164:30 - beautiful bottom
164:32 - navigation and uh I already have created
164:36 - it and it is available inside the
164:38 - starting project and if you have
164:39 - downloaded the starting project you will
164:42 - have all this uh stuff let me just show
164:46 - you inside the content feature I have
164:48 - bottom navigation
164:50 - a and as you can see I have used this
164:53 - Google or I can say GV it is a class
164:56 - from the Google Nav barar and using this
165:00 - class we have this beautiful bottom
165:02 - navigation bar and all of them Ripple
165:04 - color hover color these are all
165:06 - properties related to the UI of this gav
165:09 - and it will make the Google uh
165:11 - navigation bar much more beautiful and
165:14 - the only required parameter inside this
165:17 - gav is a tabs property
165:19 - inside which I can just create all the
165:21 - buttons I want to have inside this
165:23 - navigation bar and I have this five
165:25 - buttons uh a home viom Cloud upload
165:29 - search and
165:31 - heartbroken and this is what I got up to
165:33 - now the other properties are just
165:35 - related to the UI for example this curve
165:37 - just shows the animation that uh we have
165:41 - when we switch between the different
165:43 - tabs which right now it is is into line
165:45 - year and we have a duration for example
165:47 - we want to have a duration of for 19
165:50 - milliseconds whenever we switch between
165:53 - different
165:54 - tabs so these are all properties related
165:57 - to this uiio for example we have a color
165:59 - of gray active color icon size and tab
166:02 - background color and everything here you
166:04 - can just uh go through this and it's
166:06 - really easy and I have just used this
166:08 - package called Google navbar from Dart
166:12 - package and this is a demo of this
166:14 - package and you can see it's really
166:16 - beautiful okay so let me just use this
166:20 - bottom navigation class inside homepage
166:24 - and I have to just import
166:28 - it and right now let me do a hard
166:37 - Resort and this is the bottom navigation
166:40 - I can simply switch between different
166:42 - tabs the first one is the home video cam
166:46 - in here I will show the shorts here
166:49 - upload search and also the last one is
166:52 - going to be log out I also need to uh do
166:56 - something for this because right now we
166:57 - are getting some overflow and I will uh
167:00 - fix it that's not a big deal
167:03 - okay so right now let me have this
167:06 - functionality to show different pages
167:10 - inside each tab here and doing that let
167:13 - me just open this bottom navigation
167:17 - page uh we have have a property
167:21 - called ontap change and selected index
167:25 - and everything first of all let me have
167:28 - this ontap change so what is this ontap
167:31 - change whenever we change between
167:32 - different tabs it means that we we are
167:35 - whenever we switch between different
167:36 - tabs this uh method will be triggered
167:39 - and this index is just the index of the
167:42 - current tab that we are in right now for
167:44 - example when I'm inside this Home tab
167:47 - this index will be equal to zero when
167:49 - I'm on this short stamp it will be equal
167:51 - to one and so on and so
167:53 - forth and I can just use this to just
167:58 - create this functionality to uh move on
168:01 - between different tabs and I will not do
168:04 - anything right here and I can just pass
168:06 - a parameter for uh botom navigation and
168:10 - initialize this value inside the
168:12 - homepage and I also need to uh let me
168:15 - just create
168:17 - this uh method really fast and it's
168:20 - going to be just a
168:22 - function and it has an INT which is
168:25 - going to be the index as parameter and
168:27 - I'm going to just call it
168:34 - unpressed let me just generate
168:36 - Constructor for it and I will just
168:39 - initialize the value here to say widget
168:42 - do unpressed or I should just say
168:46 - unpressed
168:55 - okay and right now we are getting this
168:57 - error inside the
168:59 - homepage and we need to initialize this
169:02 - onpress which has this index as
169:06 - parameter and I need to do something
169:09 - inside this onpress and I also want to
169:12 - create uh something let me just first of
169:14 - all change this St this vget into a
169:16 - stateful vget and then I can have a
169:19 - current
169:20 - index it is a type integer I don't need
169:23 - to make it final we have a current
169:26 - index which is going to be equal to zero
169:29 - initially and then I can just put it
169:31 - inside this selected
169:39 - index and inside the homepage once again
169:42 - we have this current index let me also
169:44 - create it here and I will just change
169:47 - this stead vet into a stateful pdet and
169:50 - then I can just create this current
169:55 - index which again is equal to zero
169:59 - initially so what basically I'm doing is
170:02 - to just create the functionality of
170:04 - switching between different tabs and
170:07 - showing different pages based on
170:09 - different tabs that we are in right now
170:11 - and I'm just doing this because I have
170:14 - separated this bottom navigation file
170:16 - from the homepage but if I just put
170:18 - everything inside the homepage it will
170:19 - be much easier but I don't want to do it
170:21 - and just to make our code much more
170:23 - recognizable I want to go WR
170:26 - this and I have just separated this
170:29 - bottom navigation from the
170:30 - homepage and what basically we are doing
170:33 - is that whenever this uh ontap change
170:36 - method is triggered and it's triggered
170:38 - whenever we switch between different
170:40 - tabs I just want to just trigger this
170:42 - onpress which I have initialized it
170:45 - inside the homepage and what I want to
170:47 - do is to say
170:49 - whenever this unpress is triggered first
170:52 - of all I want to
170:54 - make an F statement because I will say
170:57 - if index is not equal to
171:00 - two in this case what I just want to do
171:03 - is to put this index inside the current
171:09 - index and again finally do a setad and
171:13 - why I make this estad F adment to say if
171:16 - index is not equal to two you will
171:19 - understand it later on so I will explain
171:20 - it to you why I'm doing this for now
171:23 - just understand that if index is not
171:25 - equal to do we'll put the index which is
171:27 - going to be once again I'm saying the
171:28 - index of the current tab that we are in
171:30 - inside the current
171:31 - index and let me also create some
171:36 - pages here we will have a list or I can
171:39 - just create it let me just see if we
171:41 - have it already no we haven't I just
171:44 - need to create a list inside the Library
171:48 - which is going to be the pages
171:54 - list uh let me just remove this typo
171:58 - okay so here I can just have a list
172:01 - which is going to be the
172:02 - pages of all the pages that we have
172:06 - throughout this project inside the
172:07 - bottom
172:08 - navigation and for now I'm going to just
172:10 - put some you know widgets but later on I
172:13 - can just change it and replace it with
172:15 - some real Pages for now it's going to be
172:18 - some something like home I can just copy
172:21 - and paste it some more
172:24 - times the next one is
172:26 - shorts the next one
172:29 - is uh
172:31 - upload as you can see this upload is at
172:34 - the index number two 0 one and number
172:38 - two because whenever we upload uh maybe
172:42 - you have a good uh maybe you have uh
172:46 - understanding of why I made this
172:48 - statement because uh whenever the index
172:52 - is equal to two we want to uh just
172:54 - upload video we don't want to show any
172:57 - page and the next one also will be the
172:59 - home later on I will change
173:02 - it inside the home page and uh let me
173:06 - just tell you inside the body I have to
173:11 - show uh different pages based on what we
173:15 - have so at the end of this column
173:19 - right here I can just make an expanded
173:22 - widget and the child is just going to be
173:24 - the pages first of all let me just
173:26 - import it and the index is going to be
173:29 - the current
173:33 - index okay and right now I will show you
173:36 - what I have created so far let me just
173:39 - do a hot
173:43 - restart so as you can see the first page
173:46 - is the homepage right now it is a center
173:48 - which wiget of text and right now we
173:50 - only have a center widget and inside
173:52 - which I have a text to say home when I
173:54 - navigate to this one it says shorts and
173:58 - uplers home and everything so I just I
174:02 - have just created this uh to say let me
174:04 - just explain to you once again what I
174:06 - have done so far first of all I have
174:08 - created this gnv from the Google Navar
174:11 - package and it's a package to create
174:13 - this beautiful bottom navigation bar for
174:14 - us and here we have five tabs for each
174:18 - of these tabs that we have for the home
174:20 - shorts upload search and L log
174:24 - out and we have an ontap change property
174:28 - which just it has it is a method which
174:31 - triggers every time we switch between
174:33 - different tabs and I have initialized it
174:35 - inside the homepage to say if index is
174:37 - not equal to two I want to put the index
174:40 - inside the current index which this
174:42 - current index is the current index of
174:44 - the page that we are right now so it's
174:46 - really simple and we have all this Pages
174:48 - here which later on I will replace them
174:50 - with real
174:52 - pages and we have this but whenever we
174:56 - click on this button see I have this if
174:58 - statement to say that if index is not
175:01 - equal to two this should happen this is
175:04 - index number zero index number one index
175:07 - number two so three and four this index
175:10 - number four is going to have uh in the
175:13 - index number two I want to upload a
175:15 - video so I don't want to show any page
175:17 - but what I want to show is just a model
175:20 - bottom
175:21 - shet so I believe I already have it
175:25 - inside starting project I have yeah I
175:27 - have this create bottom sheet and as you
175:30 - can see uh inside this bottom sheet I
175:32 - have some vets let me just show you in
175:35 - the imediator first of all let me just
175:37 - create it so I need to have an else
175:41 - statement if the index index is equal to
175:44 - two I just want to show a model bottom
175:46 - sheet and inside the
175:50 - Builder I will return this create bottom
175:53 - sheet which I already have
176:02 - created okay right now when I go to
176:05 - index number two which is for the upload
176:07 - this model bottom sheet appears and pop
176:09 - up and right now we have only a title to
176:12 - say create and then we have all these
176:14 - options to create a short upload a video
176:17 - go live and create the post so what I
176:21 - work right now is this upload a video
176:24 - and let me right now let me just open
176:26 - this Morel bottom sheet and this is the
176:30 - item for the upload a
176:33 - video and you can just go through this
176:35 - page uh I haven't explained it yet uh
176:38 - it's a really simple page it's a create
176:40 - bottom shade and it's simply a container
176:43 - and we have a column a text to say
176:45 - create and then I have all this image
176:47 - items
176:49 - which all of them are just inside the
176:51 - starting project you can just go through
176:53 - every single one of them and it's not
176:55 - really hard so this is the item to
176:59 - upload a video and whenever the user
177:01 - clicks on this item I want them to
177:04 - upload a video and then put it inside
177:07 - the storage and then into the fire store
177:09 - I already have this method file and here
177:13 - I will create a method to pick
177:15 - image so whenever this upload video
177:18 - button is clicked I want the user to
177:22 - pick a video I will uh create a method
177:25 - to pick a video and then they can upload
177:28 - it into the fire store and uh also the
177:32 - Firebase storage so first of all let me
177:34 - just create it real
177:36 - quick then the method name is going to
177:39 - be P
177:41 - video and of course it's going to be a
177:44 - synchronous and I can just use the image
177:47 - picker class
177:52 - to say Peck a
177:54 - video and the source for now is going to
177:56 - be just the
177:59 - gallery I'm going to just say image
178:03 - source. gallery
178:06 - okay of course it's going to be a weit
178:08 - and I can just put it inside an x
178:13 - file called file so I hope hope that you
178:18 - are already familiar how we can work
178:20 - with this image picker class I just uh
178:23 - use this method called pick video to
178:26 - pick a video from the gallery image
178:28 - seces gallery and then I have this file
178:30 - which is going to be the type x file if
178:32 - you are not familiar with this uh
178:35 - package I have already video and you can
178:37 - just check it out uh I'm not going to go
178:40 - in details but I have right now this
178:42 - file the type x file but I want to
178:44 - change it into a file type so I need to
178:48 - import this and then I will call it a
178:51 - video and to say like
178:54 - this and if you can inter send it just
178:56 - make sure to go through the video on
178:59 - image speaker
179:01 - package and finally if the video is not
179:05 - equal to
179:08 - null and that's why that I will
179:12 - return this video okay so now we have
179:16 - this pick video
179:19 - and whenever this upload the video
179:20 - button is clicked I want to show I want
179:23 - to just trigger this Pig
179:28 - video okay and let me just check it in
179:31 - the emulator that
179:33 - whenever I click this upload a video we
179:37 - will be able to upload any video from
179:40 - the gallery okay it's
179:43 - working so the next uh when we get the
179:48 - video we wanted to put it inside
179:52 - Firebase storage uh let me just open my
179:56 - uh Firebase
179:58 - project and first of all just make sure
180:00 - to enable this Firebase storage and you
180:04 - can just go through this build and then
180:06 - you can just enable this storage I have
180:09 - already done it but you should also make
180:11 - sure to do it because we need to store
180:14 - all the videos and images inside this
180:16 - Firebase storage
180:19 - now inside the methods file I can just
180:20 - create a new method called quid file in
180:22 - this storage so let me just create this
180:25 - method real
180:26 - fast and of course this method is going
180:29 - to be asynchron and what I want to do in
180:31 - this method is to just uh upload the
180:34 - file which in this is going to be a
180:35 - video inside the Firebase storage so
180:38 - first of all let me just uh import and I
180:40 - and I have already done it you just need
180:42 - to import the Firebase storage and then
180:44 - I can create an inance of Firebase
180:46 - storage
180:48 - and then using this inance of Firebase
180:51 - storage I can just use the Riff method
180:54 - and then inside the child I can specify
180:56 - where this file should be located inside
180:58 - the fireb storage which in this case I'm
181:01 - going to just use a
181:02 - parameter uh I need actually three
181:04 - parameters here the first parameter is
181:06 - going to be the file so it's the file
181:08 - that I'm going to upload inside the
181:09 - storage the number uh the second one is
181:11 - going to be the number and it's just
181:13 - simply that a number that help me to
181:16 - differ between different files and
181:18 - different videos and also the third one
181:20 - which is going to be the file type I
181:22 - just need to specify whether this file
181:24 - is a video or image or something because
181:27 - I need to use this method for uploading
181:29 - the video and also uploading the profile
181:31 - picture and I can just use it for both
181:33 - cases so let me just uh specify the file
181:36 - type and here the first thing that I'm
181:38 - going to just say is I want to uh just
181:41 - upload the file type so first of all I
181:44 - just need to specify the file type so we
181:46 - understand that this file a type of
181:48 - video or image or something the next I
181:51 - just use uh something like a number and
181:53 - as I said this number is just used to
181:56 - specify and differ between different
181:58 - files I mean between different images
182:00 - and different videos and it help us to
182:02 - do that so the result of this method is
182:04 - going to be something like a riff so let
182:06 - me just store it inside this riff
182:09 - variable and then I can just use this
182:12 - Riff to put the file I can put a file I
182:15 - can put a string data or blob but in
182:17 - this case I'm going to just put
182:18 - a file and the file is going to be this
182:21 - file which is this
182:23 - one and I will just store this result of
182:25 - this inside a variable called upload and
182:29 - then I just need to let it up be
182:31 - uploaded so let me just await this
182:34 - upload and what I'm doing is just uh
182:36 - giving it some time for this file to be
182:38 - uploaded inside this storage and then I
182:41 - will put the result inside a variable
182:43 - called
182:45 - snapshot okay and now finally using this
182:48 - snapshot I can just download the URL so
182:51 - let me just use this RI and finally get
182:53 - download URL so basically we are just
182:56 - downloading it and the result is going
182:57 - to be the type of string so let me just
183:00 - write string and it is uh download
183:04 - URL and of course it's going to be a
183:07 - wait because it will take some time and
183:09 - if we don't know when the uh snapshot
183:12 - will be downloaded and finally I just
183:14 - want to return this uh download URL let
183:18 - me just uh correct this
183:22 - typo okay so let me just explain once
183:25 - again that what we are doing inside this
183:27 - method first of all I just create an
183:29 - instance of fireb storage and then I use
183:31 - this RI and finally the child to just
183:34 - specify where I want this file to be
183:36 - located inside the storage and I just
183:38 - said it should be first of all I need to
183:40 - specify the file type and then a number
183:42 - to Just differ between different images
183:43 - and videos and then using this RI which
183:46 - we got the result from the first method
183:48 - I just uh used it to put the file inside
183:51 - the storage and then we await this
183:53 - upload because we will give it some time
183:55 - to be uploaded and finally I just
183:57 - downloaded a uh URL and of course it's a
184:01 - type of string and it this download URL
184:03 - is basically the URL of the video or the
184:06 - image that we uploaded and I can just
184:08 - use this method across my project and
184:10 - use it to put any file inside the
184:12 - storage so I can use it many
184:15 - times now that you are done here let me
184:17 - just go back to uploading the video and
184:20 - the first thing I need to do is to just
184:22 - create a page so as you can see inside
184:25 - the upload bottom sheet whenever the
184:27 - user clicks on this button upload a
184:29 - video we let them to upload a video and
184:32 - pick a video from their Galler and once
184:34 - the video is picked I want them to go to
184:37 - a new page called uh video details and
184:41 - inside that page they can just uh give
184:43 - their video a title a description and
184:45 - then they can choose uh a thumbnail
184:47 - finally they can publish their video
184:50 - inside the database so first of all let
184:54 - me just create this page and later on
184:55 - they can work on the logic okay so
184:59 - inside the upload feature I can create a
185:01 - new file a new uh folder which I'm going
185:04 - to call long
185:07 - video okay so this is going to be the
185:09 - long video and first of all I will
185:11 - create a page called video Details page
185:20 - input the material.
185:22 - dart and create an status fidget which
185:25 - I'm going to just call it video details
185:29 - PCH here just like always I need to uh
185:33 - return an scaffold later I have a body a
185:37 - safe
185:38 - area the child is going to be a
185:41 - padding and it has a padding from the
185:44 - top
185:45 - side padding of 20
185:51 - the child of this padding is just going
185:52 - to be a
185:53 - column and I need to create everything
185:56 - right here so first of all uh let me
185:58 - just explain to you that what's uh uh
186:01 - going to be this page and how it will
186:02 - look like I just want to create a page
186:05 - inside which I can uh you know enter and
186:09 - insert all the details of my video uh
186:13 - first of all I need to create uh a text
186:16 - fi for entering the title then I need to
186:18 - create a text fill for entering the
186:20 - description so I need basically two text
186:21 - fills and then I want to create a button
186:24 - called select
186:26 - thumbnail and when user clicks on it
186:28 - they can select their thumbnail and
186:30 - finally they can publish their video so
186:32 - let me just work on it inside the column
186:35 - uh inside the children property first of
186:38 - all I will create a text
186:40 - field so Tex fil has a decoration just
186:44 - type input
186:45 - decoration let me give it a text to say
186:49 - enter the
186:51 - title and then I also want to give it a
186:54 - suffix icon or maybe a perfect second uh
186:56 - okay first of all let me just run the
186:58 - emulator that we can see how this page
187:00 - is going to look like and we can see it
187:03 - real
187:10 - time okay now the project is run and uh
187:14 - let me just go inside the men D and
187:16 - change the homepage to this this page
187:17 - that I'm just creating it which is going
187:20 - to be the video Details page I'm just
187:22 - doing it for now and later on I can just
187:24 - fix all of them and this is the page and
187:26 - this is the text field that I just
187:27 - created let me just minimize this vs
187:30 - that you can see the emulator
187:33 - properly and I can just do it like this
187:37 - now inside this video Details page uh
187:39 - the first thing that I just created was
187:41 - a text fi and I can also give it a a
187:44 - padding from the left and the right side
187:46 - and I will with a padding of 10 from the
187:49 - left from the left and also from the
187:51 - right
187:53 - side and it will look much better right
187:56 - now and I can just modify this text fi
187:59 - like uh giving it the border which is
188:01 - going to be the
188:02 - type outline input
188:05 - border and here the Border
188:08 - Side and now I want to just give it a
188:11 - color of something like
188:15 - blue now I have this text field to
188:17 - enable me enter the title and I just
188:20 - want to create the same text field also
188:23 - for the description but before that let
188:25 - me also give it a perect
188:28 - icon so exactly here I can give it a
188:31 - perect icon which is going to be the
188:33 - type icon and the name will be
188:37 - title so this is the icon that I want to
188:39 - have as a perix and it looks like
188:41 - this and before this text field I also
188:44 - want to have a text to say enter the
188:46 - title let me just create this as well
188:50 - that I can just tell the user that okay
188:52 - you need to create uh you need to enter
188:55 - your title here and it looks like this I
188:58 - just need to maybe change the cross AIS
189:03 - alignment to start and now it looks
189:07 - great let me also change the text style
189:09 - of this
189:14 - text to give it a f size of like 15 a
189:18 - color
189:20 - of
189:22 - gray okay and now it should lock nice
189:27 - and I can also give it a size box uh to
189:29 - give it a distance from this text field
189:32 - and it will be a size box with a height
189:34 - of
189:35 - four okay I give it a size box with a
189:38 - height of five and now it looks much
189:40 - better let me just uh do it real quick
189:43 - for also the description I need to Cate
189:45 - a text like this to say in enter the
189:49 - description and I need to create the
189:52 - same text field again this time for the
189:55 - description so let me just copy it and
189:58 - paste it right there I just need to
189:59 - change this SX as say enter the
190:02 - description and I also need to change
190:04 - the perfect icon and I need
190:08 - to actually I don't need to have a
190:10 - perfect icon so let me just remove this
190:12 - perfect icon okay so now it looks great
190:14 - and I also need to give a size box
190:16 - between these two so I will
190:20 - create a size box with a height of
190:22 - something like 20 or I also should
190:25 - change this to like
190:29 - 40 or I believe 30 is enough and I again
190:32 - need to have uh you know a size box
190:36 - between these two to give it a size box

190:41 - five okay that's great now I I have a
190:44 - text fi for a title and also text fi for
190:46 - a description

190:53 - thumbnail so let me just specify it here
190:55 - that I need to I just make a comment to
190:57 - say I need to create a button to select
190:59 - thumbnail from here and it's going to be

191:24 - container actually I just want to create
191:27 - a container which
191:29 - has uh first of all let me change let me
191:32 - give it a color so I will give it a
191:34 - color of
191:36 - blue and I also want to change the
191:38 - Border radius so I will give it a b
191:40 - radius of something like
191:42 - 11 bar radius. all and then I give it a
191:45 - bar radius of type circular which is
191:50 - 11 and then the child of this
191:54 - uh container is going to be just a text
191:57 - button and it it has an unpressed which
192:00 - for now is going to be just empty and
192:02 - the text is just going to say select
192:14 - thumbnail okay and I also want to change
192:18 - the text style of this select
192:23 - thumbnail and I will give it a color of
192:28 - white okay everything is perfect I just
192:31 - need to go above the page and here this
192:36 - cross uh cross aess alignment should be
192:39 - stretch and now as you can see
192:42 - this button looks like this which is
192:45 - perfect and let me also wrap this
192:49 - container with a
192:53 - padding and I will give it a padding
192:55 - from the top side and a padding of 12
192:58 - okay that looks I believe so
193:01 - great and I also want to change
193:04 - something from this inter the
193:05 - description text field because I want to
193:07 - give it uh I want this text field to be
193:09 - much bigger than this so I need to
193:11 - change the max lines of this text fill
193:15 - to be something like five
193:18 - actually not the title the
193:21 - description so now this title uh this
193:24 - description text field is much bigger
193:26 - because description has more stuff to
193:29 - write inside okay everything is
193:32 - good and now let me just change this
193:36 - this widget into wiget because I need to
193:38 - create some controllers for this text
193:40 - field and I also want it to be like this
193:43 - okay whenever the user uh clicks on this
193:45 - select thumbnail they should be able to
193:48 - pick an image and that image is going to
193:50 - be the thumbnail of this video and then
193:53 - when the image is uploaded I want to
193:56 - display the image right here and also
193:59 - whenever the image is selected so the
194:00 - image here is going to be the thumbnail
194:02 - and when the thumbnail is selected I
194:04 - want to display a button here to say
194:07 - publish the
194:08 - video so first of all let me just create
194:11 - this uh controllers for the text field
194:13 - and the first one is going to be just a
194:15 - title controller
194:22 - which is of course the type text editing
194:24 - controller let me just copy and paste it
194:27 - one more time and the second one is
194:29 - going to be for description
194:35 - controller and I will just put it
194:38 - inside uh a property called controller
194:42 - the first one is for the title
194:44 - controller and of course I just need to
194:46 - remove this
194:48 - const and the second one is going to be
194:50 - for the description
194:54 - controller and once again I just need to
194:56 - remove this const from here okay now I
195:00 - also want to create a variable for
195:02 - saying if the thumbnail is selected or
195:04 - not so let me just create a Boolean
195:07 - which I'm going to just call it s
195:10 - thumbnail selected so if the Tom is
195:13 - selected or not based on it I want to
195:15 - show different stuff inside this
195:19 - page and I'm going to just create a
195:23 - new button here for publishing the video
195:27 - so let me just copy everything from this
195:30 - uh Button as well I will just take this
195:34 - and copy it one more time I'm going to
195:35 - just change this to
195:37 - say publish and I also I also want to
195:41 - change the color to Green now I have
195:44 - this uh second button to publish the
195:46 - video and and I don't want this button
195:48 - to be displayed whenever the thumbnail
195:51 - is not selected I mean when the
195:53 - thumbnail is selected in which case I
195:55 - want to show this display uh this
195:58 - publish button so let me just uh give it
196:00 - a you know a condition to say if is
196:03 - thumbnail selected variable is equal to
196:06 - true in this case only I want to show
196:08 - this publish button but if it's not true
196:11 - I just want to show a size box it means
196:15 - nothing and right now you can see
196:17 - because this thumbnail selected variable
196:19 - is equal to files right now uh we are
196:23 - not seeing anything so right now I need
196:26 - to uh select the thumbnail whenever the
196:28 - user clicks on this but select thumbnail
196:31 - I want
196:32 - to uh select a thumbnail so I need to
196:35 - have a peak image uh method let me just
196:39 - open this method folder uh file and I
196:42 - need to create a new method here to say
196:45 - Peak
196:47 - image and here of course this image is
196:49 - going to be just our thumbnail and you
196:52 - know what I can just copy everything
196:53 - from here let me just copy it and paste
196:56 - it right there I just need to change
196:58 - this peak video into Peak image they're
197:01 - completely the same once again I'm
197:02 - saying that if you don't know how to
197:03 - work with this image picker class so as
197:06 - you can see I have UT this this image
197:09 - picker it is a DT package and if you
197:11 - don't know how to work with it I have a
197:13 - video already and you can learn
197:15 - everything about this package but for
197:17 - now yeah we are doing this and we are
197:19 - picking
197:21 - image and finally I should call it image
197:23 - not
197:24 - video okay now let me back get back here
197:28 - and whenever the user clicks on this
197:30 - button I want this peak image method to
197:34 - be triggered okay and it will just let
197:38 - them to pick image from gallery and as
197:40 - you can see the return uh uh the return
197:43 - of this method is just an image so I can
197:46 - just get that
197:48 - and I can just put it inside a variable
197:50 - called like
197:54 - image and let me just create this
197:57 - variable as well of course it's going to
197:59 - be the type string so let me just create
198:02 - a final no no it's not final a string
198:05 - called image and it will be initially
198:08 - equal to uh it will not have an initial
198:11 - value so I have a string image and when
198:15 - the user Peak an
198:18 - image uh later on i1 the result of that
198:22 - Peak image go inside and be stored
198:25 - inside this image variable and when we
198:27 - pick an image it means that we selected
198:29 - a thumbnail I want this thumbnail
198:31 - selected variable to be equal to true
198:33 - because we selected the thumbnail again
198:35 - I'm going to do a set it and now I just
198:39 - want to display this image right
198:42 - here so I will display it right here to
198:45 - say if it's thumbnail selected is equal
198:48 - to true I want to show
198:51 - this uh file type which is going to be
198:54 - image let's see what is the error
198:58 - here okay I just need to change because
199:01 - that's not a type of string actually
199:02 - it's a type of file now the error should
199:06 - be gone yeah that's
199:09 - right and I also say if it's not true I
199:12 - want to just display a size
199:15 - box so what you saying here that if this
199:17 - thumbnail selected is equal to true I
199:19 - want to show this image and it has a
199:22 - cached height which in this case going
199:24 - to be
199:26 - 160 and also it has a cached WID which
199:29 - is going to be 400
199:33 - okay everything is done and now let me
199:37 - just do a hot rest and we will check how
199:39 - it's looking and I will also explain to
199:41 - you once again that what we did
199:42 - throughout this file so now I can inter
199:47 - title and then I can enter a description
199:50 - and then I can select the
199:52 - thumbnail
199:54 - and right now I don't have any image so
199:57 - let me just put some image inside this
199:59 - emulator I will go inside my
200:02 - pictures and I can just put this image
200:05 - right
200:11 - here yeah now I can just select this
200:14 - image and once I selected it should be
200:18 - uploaded right here so let me see if
200:20 - there's any problem when I click on this
200:22 - Peck image button this meod should be
200:24 - triggered and then the result of this uh
200:26 - method which is going to be an image it
200:28 - should be stored inside this image and
200:31 - once it's done I want a select the
200:33 - thumbnail to be equal to true and then
200:35 - do a set set so what's wrong here let me
200:37 - just terminate the project and run it
200:39 - once
200:43 - again now when I click on this button I
200:46 - can s an IM image and again it's not
200:48 - working so let me just check what's the
200:50 - problem here when we pick an image this
200:53 - s th s it should be equal to true and
200:56 - then I do a set
200:57 - set it's just saying that future Dynamic
201:00 - is not a subtype of
201:03 - file maybe I just need to specify the
201:07 - return type of this peak image which is
201:08 - going to be a future of file this is the
201:12 - type of this big image and of course it
201:14 - just need to be like this and let me
201:18 - just remove this if admin I don't need
201:20 - it anymore
201:21 - really let me just make it like this and
201:24 - then I have to await this method and
201:29 - make this method a signal I hope the
201:31 - error is gone
201:36 - now now if I select the thumbnail again
201:39 - it's not
201:40 - working maybe I need to have back this
201:43 - seted
201:47 - and now when i s a
201:48 - thumbnail yeah it's working perfectly
201:51 - okay that's
201:52 - great now we have this thumbnail let me
201:55 - just give it a size box uh I want this
201:58 - image to have some distance from the top
202:00 - side so let me just find this
202:03 - image and then I want it to have a
202:10 - padding we will have a padding from the
202:12 - top side okay and I can also do it the
202:15 - same uh here I wanted to have a padding
202:19 - from the top uh from the down side as
202:21 - well from the bottom side I will give it
202:23 - a padding from the bottom 12 as well so
202:26 - now it's working it's great and now what
202:28 - I basically want to do is to whenever I
202:30 - select on this uh button when I select
202:33 - the thumbnail and now I can publish the
202:35 - video whenever I click on this button to
202:38 - publish the video my video model and my
202:41 - video should be uh published and the
202:44 - data should be stored inside the
202:45 - database so first of all I need to
202:47 - create this video model so let me just
202:50 - go and create it inside the long video I
202:53 - can have a new file called video
202:56 - model and let's see which features uh I
203:00 - mean which fills do we need inside this
203:03 - model so let me just create a class
203:06 - called video
203:09 - model and here we're going to have some
203:12 - Fails Like video URL thumbnail title
203:14 - that published views video user ID type
203:18 - and likes so let me just create them one
203:20 - by one the first one is going to be the
203:23 - video
203:24 - URL the next one is going to be
203:30 - thumbnail the next one title the next
203:32 - one is going to be date published I also
203:35 - want to know on which date the video was
203:38 - published the next one is going to be
203:41 - views the next one is video ID so each
203:45 - video should have a unique video ID that
203:46 - we can later on refer to that video and
203:49 - I also want to have a user ID because I
203:51 - want to know which user and which
203:53 - channel has published this specific
203:56 - video and the next one is going to be a
203:58 - list of likes so I just want to know
204:02 - that how many people and which people
204:04 - has liked this
204:07 - video and also the final one is going to
204:10 - be type and once again if you don't know
204:12 - why I'm just creating this type I want
204:15 - to just uh specify that this model is a
204:19 - video or it's a user and in the next
204:21 - feature which is going to be the search
204:23 - feature you will understand that why I'm
204:25 - creating this
204:27 - type now let me just generate
204:29 - Constructor for it and I also want to
204:31 - generate Json
204:35 - calization and I will remove this two
204:37 - because we don't need it anymore and
204:39 - also this
204:41 - convert uh we getting some error here
204:45 - now the errors are gone and everything
204:47 - is okay so now I have this video
204:50 - model and what basically I want to do is
204:54 - to just when the thumbnail is selected
204:57 - and I have the image inside here I want
205:00 - to publish the video and the first thing
205:03 - that I want to do is to put the file
205:05 - inside the storage so what basically I'm
205:07 - doing is just to
205:10 - say uh use the put file in the
205:13 - storage the file is going to be the
205:15 - image
205:17 - the number is going to be just some
205:18 - random number so I will use the U the
205:21 - uid package let me just import
205:24 - it and using this package I can just
205:28 - create a random number okay it's going
205:31 - to be the type string I will call it
205:34 - random
205:41 - number and I will use the V4 method so
205:45 - it just generate a ROM number for us and
205:47 - I can just use it to differ between
205:48 - different files I will use this random
205:51 - number and the file typ here is going to
205:53 - be
205:55 - video so first of all I put the file
205:58 - inside the storage and of course the
205:59 - result is going to be my thumbnail and I
206:01 - can just put it inside a variable called
206:07 - thumbnail so now that I have the
206:09 - thumbnail I actually want to upload the
206:13 - video inside the fireb fire ser and for
206:16 - being it I need to create a repository
206:18 - to upload a video and I'm going to just
206:21 - call it video
206:26 - repository here I need to create a class
206:28 - called video
206:32 - repository and here once again I need to
206:35 - have a Firebase a and also a Firebase
206:37 - Fire Resource so let me just create them
206:39 - really fast the first one is a Firebase
206:41 - fire and the next one is going to be
206:43 - Firebase us and I'm going to just call
206:46 - it Al and let me just let me just
206:48 - generate Constructor for it and now the
206:51 - first method uh is going to be just
206:53 - uploading the video into the fire store
206:56 - so I will create a method called upload
206:58 - video to fire
207:02 - store this me is going to be any
207:05 - synchronous and then here I just want to
207:08 - upload it so I will use this firer and
207:11 - then I will create a new collection
207:13 - called videos and the document of this
207:18 - uh video is going to be just the video
207:21 - ID and then I can set the data and the
207:26 - data is going to be here a video model
207:28 - so let me just create this video model
207:31 - first of all import it video model and
207:33 - it's going to be equal to video model so
207:37 - this is our video model and let's
207:38 - initialize the value here first of all
207:41 - we have a video URL so all this uh
207:43 - things should be you know initialize
207:47 - using this parameters so let me just let
207:49 - me just give it some parameters required
207:52 - string video URL the next one is
207:54 - required string the thumbnail because we
207:57 - need to have all this values uh from the
208:00 - video Details
208:04 - page the next one is a thumbnail the
208:06 - next one is going to be the title and
208:08 - description actually I don't need
208:09 - description but I need the thumbnail the
208:12 - next one is dat published views is going
208:14 - to be just empty and then video video ID
208:17 - it's going to be again to type string
208:20 - this video ID and again it's going to be
208:24 - de published actually it's a type dead
208:30 - time and I need the user ID as
208:37 - well and here I get this error because I
208:40 - made a mistake while creating the video
208:43 - model let me just uh correct it because
208:46 - this de publish is not a type string
208:48 - actually it's a type de
208:50 - time and I just need to fix that and
208:53 - here it's not as a string it's as date
208:57 - time now the errors should be gone and
209:00 - this views is going to be just an empty
209:03 - list actually it's going to be zero so
209:07 - this views is Ty okay again I made this
209:09 - mistake views is not a type uh string
209:12 - but it's a type integer
209:16 - and I just need to also correct it right
209:20 - here so this view is going to be equal
209:23 - to zero and the likes is going to be a
209:25 - LM list and the type is going to be
209:28 - video so now everything is
209:32 - okay and here I will just set this to
209:34 - video. two map because I want to put the
209:38 - data inside apply the data inside the
209:40 - Firebase fire sir and let me just do an
209:44 - await here and now everything should be
209:47 - okay let me also just remove this
209:50 - unnecessary
209:53 - stuff so now I have this and let me just
209:57 - create a controller and a provider for
209:59 - this so I will just say final video
210:03 - controller I should say or video
210:05 - provider I mean so I would say long
210:09 - video provider just like what we did in
210:12 - the previous examples as well and it's
210:15 - going to have a simple provider which
210:17 - returns this video
210:20 - repository and the Firebase is going to
210:23 - be just Firebase
210:24 - fire not sense and I believe I don't
210:27 - need this Firebase Al so I will just
210:28 - remove
210:32 - this and I will also remove this from
210:36 - here now everything should be good and I
210:40 - can just use this long video
210:43 - provider and here for first of all let
210:46 - me just change this St full widget into
210:49 - a consumer St full
210:52 - widget and I will put this consumer in
210:56 - here and also here so you're already
211:00 - familiar with this things and you know
211:02 - how can I do
211:04 - it and here I can just use this RI to
211:07 - call the watch method and then I will
211:09 - use the long video
211:11 - provider to access it as with upload
211:14 - video for fire sir
211:16 - now I have to initialize all this
211:18 - parameters dat published and everything
211:20 - the data publish is going to be just dat
211:22 - time.now simple the next one is going to
211:26 - be user ID which is going to
211:29 - be Firebase
211:32 - alsin sense. Curren
211:35 - user. ID so the user ID is going to be
211:39 - just the uh U ID of the current user
211:42 - because only the current user is
211:43 - uploading the video right it's
211:46 - absolutely
211:48 - clear let me just put a comma here and
211:51 - then I have the video URL thumbnail is
211:54 - okay the title is going to be just the
211:56 - title controller.
211:59 - text and then this video ID I can just
212:02 - create a random ID so let me just create
212:05 - this one as
212:08 - well I will say string I will just call
212:12 - it the video ID and it's going to be
212:14 - again
212:16 - V4 so this is going to be my video
212:20 - ID and finally this video URL is just
212:24 - okay uh so this was a thumbnail I
212:27 - believe there is a mistake here the
212:30 - video yeah I will get the video from the
212:32 - previous page so I just need to create
212:33 - it as a parameter here let me just
212:36 - create it right here to say final I
212:38 - believe it's Ty file so I'm going to
212:40 - just sa video I just need to get this
212:44 - video from the previous page
212:46 - and now let me also correct this because
212:49 - this is not a video it is an
212:51 - image because this is our thumbnail and
212:54 - the video URL is going to be just
212:56 - widget. video and I will have access to
212:58 - it from the previous page so now
213:01 - everything should be okay and I just
213:03 - need to upload a video and inside this
213:06 - pick video whenever I pick the video in
213:08 - this case I want to get back to that
213:11 - whenever I get the video I don't want to
213:14 - just return it but actually I want to do
213:16 - a navigation so I want to just do like
213:19 - this and then say material page out and
213:22 - I just want to make a na navigation to
213:25 - video Details page and the video is
213:28 - going to be just the video of course I
213:31 - can just remove this uh return because I
213:33 - don't want to return
213:36 - anything I will just change this string
213:39 - to a
213:40 - file and I will also need to give it a
213:44 - context
213:48 - and now everything should be
213:50 - okay I will initialize this context
213:53 - right
213:56 - here and I also want to say that what we
213:59 - are returning from this big video which
214:01 - is uh just a future of file as we saw
214:05 - from the previous
214:06 - one and actually we are not returning
214:10 - anything it's just a future here I want
214:13 - to say that it is a wait
214:16 - and again it's this is a
214:18 - s so I believe everything should be okay
214:22 - right now let's see if there's any error
214:25 - here
214:26 - because it says that the argument type
214:29 - file can be assigned to a string because
214:32 - I need to take its path not the actual
214:35 - video okay so everything is okay let me
214:38 - just do hard restart and if there is no
214:41 - error actually we have some error here
214:47 - let me just remove this required we
214:49 - don't need it to be required and I just
214:52 - need to put a exclamation mark here so
214:55 - now everything should be okay let me
214:57 - just do a hot restart and everything
214:59 - should be working so I forgot just one
215:01 - step right here and that is that I also
215:03 - need to put the video inside the storage
215:06 - and then I need to get the URL back and
215:08 - put it inside the database so let me
215:10 - just do this step real quick and I will
215:13 - just create uh this video URL variable
215:16 - and then I can just use this put file
215:17 - into the storage and the file here just
215:21 - needs to be the video I mean the widget.
215:23 - video that we get it as parameter from
215:26 - the previous page and then we have this
215:29 - number which is again going to be just
215:32 - uh that random number that we just
215:34 - created and the file type is going to be
215:36 - just a video instead of a thumbnail or
215:40 - image so now I have this video URL and
215:44 - when I use this provider and inside this
215:46 - method I will just use this video URL as
215:52 - uh my video that is going to be uploaded
215:53 - Inside the Fire
215:55 - database so now everything should be
215:58 - okay and when I upload the video uh it
216:00 - should just be upload it and we will
216:02 - check it so let me just run the
216:12 - project okay then this is our project
216:16 - and let me just uh make uh everything
216:18 - just right because we don't want to just
216:20 - see this B inside the men Dart uh let me
216:23 - just do like this and then I will close
216:26 - all the pages and then inside the men
216:31 - Dart uh I just don't want to show this
216:33 - video details the screen but instead I
216:35 - want to show the
216:37 - homepage and this is going to be my
216:41 - homepage and
216:44 - now I need to just create all that Pages
216:47 - like Channel page and the next upload
216:49 - page whenever I click on here and when I
216:52 - click here I can upload just a video and
216:56 - when I upload this video let me just
216:58 - check if it works or not so when I click
217:00 - on it it should just go and upload the
217:02 - file inside the database first of all we
217:04 - are navigated to this page so here I can
217:07 - just type a title for this uh video
217:10 - which is going to be first video on the
217:14 - platform
217:19 - and then the description which is going
217:20 - to be something like hello it's not
217:22 - really important as you saw I have not
217:25 - added a description inside my video
217:27 - model but it can be just a homework to
217:30 - you and you can just add the description
217:32 - inside your model uh and you can just
217:33 - show it on but I have not done it so I
217:35 - don't need it and the next I can just
217:37 - select a thumbnail so I'm going to
217:38 - select this one and now I'm able to
217:41 - publish the video so let's see if it's
217:43 - working or do we get any error
217:56 - the type feature Dynamic is not a type
217:58 - of string so that's going to be our
218:00 - error and that's right here if I put on
218:05 - a
218:06 - weit and do a sing here maybe it can
218:10 - just solve our problem let me also do it
218:12 - for the next method because as you know
218:15 - this put file in the storage is going to
218:16 - be a type of future let me also make it
218:19 - clear that it is a type of future string
218:21 - I mean what we return from this method
218:23 - is a future of a string it just need to
218:26 - be more clear and I await this method
218:28 - let me do a hard rest start and I'm
218:29 - going to just uh try one one more
218:35 - time let's come here I will click upload
218:39 - a video and I will upload this video
218:42 - near I'm going to just run it once again
218:45 - first
218:46 - video on the
218:50 - platform description is going to be just
218:52 - hello I will select a thumbnail for it
218:55 - like this video and then I can just
218:58 - publish the
218:59 - video let's see if it works this time or
219:04 - not okay it looks like everything is
219:07 - just right so we have this new
219:10 - collection of videos and as you can see
219:12 - this is going to be the video ID and
219:15 - this is the title which it says first
219:17 - video on the platform the type is video
219:20 - this is the user ID it means uh the user
219:22 - ID of the channel who uploaded this
219:24 - video into this platform and then we
219:26 - have this video ID and as you can see
219:28 - this video ID and this one right here is
219:31 - exactly the same because we want it to
219:32 - be the same and the guy who uploaded
219:36 - this video has this user ID B4 AP and if
219:39 - I just open this users collection you
219:42 - can see that it should be exactly right
219:45 - here here and the guy B for EP this is
219:49 - the exact guy which is of course div
219:52 - this is the account that I just upload
219:54 - the video with so everything is correct
219:57 - and it's working perfectly well and now
220:00 - that I I can upload the video into the
220:02 - firest fire store I want to be able to
220:04 - retrieve this video and display it into
220:07 - the UI so I can just do it using
220:10 - something like stream Builder and let's
220:13 - start working on it
220:15 - so now I have to work on just you know
220:18 - retrieving the data and the video back
220:21 - from the firester database and I can
220:24 - just do it inside this content feature
220:26 - it's also one of the other features that
220:28 - I have and I want to show my videos
220:30 - short videos and comments inside this
220:32 - content feature and as you can see I
220:34 - have already this long video in which I
220:37 - have this part
220:38 - video and this is going to be the video
220:41 - and it's just a starting project and we
220:43 - have some stuff here and and I also have
220:47 - this uh bar of navigation which already
220:50 - we saw it and also I have this widgets
220:52 - which is going to be video external
220:54 - button it's just a simple widget it has
220:57 - a container and a row and I have also
220:59 - video first comment which for now I
221:02 - don't have to be concerned of the
221:04 - comment I just need to work on the video
221:06 - so let's start working on it and the
221:09 - first thing that I want to just create
221:11 - is a post because this post is going to
221:13 - be just something uh this post is going
221:16 - to be the first thing that the user sees
221:18 - when he open the feed screen I mean uh
221:21 - the thumbnail and the title and
221:23 - everything will be inside this post so
221:26 - actually this post uh widget is going to
221:28 - be just the thumbnail and the title and
221:32 - this stuff that you want to show it to
221:35 - the user I'm going to just show a
221:36 - thumbnail a title and the profile
221:39 - picture display name of the channel who
221:43 - uploaded that video and also I want to
221:45 - to show that how many views that video
221:47 - has and also uh the date published of
221:50 - the video so I'm going to just show this
221:51 - stuff inside this page and let's start
221:54 - creating it first of all I will just
221:56 - import the material. dart create an set
221:59 - this widget and I don't need to create
222:03 - an scaffold first of all let me just
222:05 - give it a name something like post and
222:08 - that's
222:10 - enough and here as I said I don't need
222:13 - to create an scaffold but I do need to
222:15 - create something like a
222:18 - container and then the child will be a
222:25 - column so first of all let me just tell
222:27 - you how it's going to be
222:29 - created um the first thing is going to
222:32 - be uh the thumbnail so the thumbnail
222:35 - that we already uploaded and here it's
222:37 - going to be just a cached Network image
222:40 - and then after that I can show the
222:42 - profile picture and title and later on
222:44 - the display and uh number of views and
222:47 - also the did publish so it's going to be
222:49 - really easy and
222:50 - quick first of all let me just inut the
222:53 - cached Network image I will use this
222:55 - package to show this uh
223:00 - thumbnail and for doing it let me just
223:03 - create cached Network image widget and
223:06 - the image URL for now I'm going to just
223:08 - use uh some random ede from the internet
223:12 - let me just type here
223:14 - image and I can just use any image for
223:16 - now it's going to be just hardcoded for
223:18 - now but later on I can just add the
223:21 - actual thumbnail when we get the data
223:23 - but for now it's going to be just
223:25 - hardcoded that you can just see it for
223:27 - now copy image address yeah I can just
223:31 - copy this address and paste it exactly
223:33 - right
223:35 - here okay this is going to be the cached
223:38 - Network image let me just put a comma
223:42 - here so after showing the image
223:45 - then I can show the perfect picture and
223:48 - title but before that as I said uh let
223:51 - me just work and just uh put all the
223:56 - pages inside the which they should be so
223:59 - let me just do
224:01 - [Music]
224:02 - some stuff here I'm going to show all
224:05 - the pages for example when I click on
224:07 - this button and when I click on this
224:10 - button on the profile picture I should
224:12 - see the account pit which I already have
224:14 - it like let me just show it to you
224:16 - exactly here I have an account feature
224:19 - and right here I have all the items
224:21 - which is exactly the same like the
224:23 - YouTube uh so let me just show this
224:27 - page and for now there is no page
224:30 - exactly but I have this
224:35 - items and so first of all let me just
224:37 - create you know this uh account pitch
224:40 - because it's really necessary so I'm
224:42 - going to just create a pitch called
224:44 - account pitch
224:49 - and I will import the material. dart
224:52 - create an stus fidget
224:54 - and I will just call it account
224:59 - page and return and
225:05 - scaffold and inside this account page I
225:07 - just need to show all the users data
225:10 - actual the current users actual data and
225:13 - for doing it uh
225:15 - inside the body I can have a
225:18 - column and inside the children's I can
225:20 - show everything right here and for now
225:23 - I'm going to just show the
225:31 - items so now let me just open this
225:35 - homepage and what I want to do is when I
225:37 - the user clicks on this profile picture
225:39 - they should be navigated to the account
225:42 - page so let me just find this
225:45 - uh Circle aatar and I will just wrap it
225:47 - with a gesture
225:49 - detector and inside the onp property I
225:51 - can say whenever the user clicks on it I
225:53 - want them to be navigated to that page
225:57 - so let me just create a navigator real
226:11 - quick okay now as you can see when I C
226:14 - click on this I'm navigated to this page
226:17 - and let me just do some customization
226:19 - inside this page and I'm going to just
226:22 - come here first of all I will up this
226:24 - column with a safe area and also give it
226:27 - a padding just like
226:30 - always and let me now just wrap it with
226:33 - a
226:40 - padding and I will give it a padding of
226:42 - 20 from the top side just like always
226:45 - and now I also want to show the users
226:48 - the current users information like the
226:50 - profile picture the display name and
226:52 - everything so let me just do that as
226:54 - well inside the column first of all I
226:56 - need to create a circle
226:58 - aor it's going to have big radius like
227:02 - 40 I'll say a background image of
227:09 - gray and then below that I can just uh
227:13 - create a text
227:15 - which I will show just the display
227:20 - name I need to change the texy to give
227:23 - it a f size of something like 24 and
227:26 - also the F way of
227:29 - bold and that's
227:35 - enough then I also want to show the
227:37 - username so let me just create that one
227:40 - as well something like Ahmed amini at
227:42 - sign Ahmed amini I I also want to change
227:45 - the
227:48 - style and we will have a f size of like
227:51 - 1.5 and also a color of blue
228:00 - gray okay so this is going to be my
228:02 - username I can just change this page
228:04 - later on as like if I want to change it
228:07 - I can just customize this display name
228:09 - username and everything and I can just
228:11 - make it the way I want it looks like but
228:14 - for now I'm going to just be okay with
228:15 - this and just let me uh have a padding
228:20 - with this text so I will wrap this text
228:22 - with a padding and I would give it a
228:24 - padding from the uh from the bottom
228:27 - side and it going to be a padding of 12
228:31 - so I hope it looks uh much better and I
228:34 - also can have a padding you know uh
228:38 - right here so I will WRA this text as
228:40 - well with a padding and I will have a
228:42 - padding this time from the top side
228:45 - again a padding of
228:47 - 12 so everything is okay now let me just
228:50 - uh have a parameter here so the
228:53 - parameter is going to be a user model
228:56 - because we want to show the uh exact
228:58 - user the current users's data inside
229:01 - this page I will call it user and
229:03 - generate
229:05 - Constructor so now I have to initialize
229:07 - the value here which is going to be this
229:10 - current user so first of all let me
229:12 - remove this cons and then the user is
229:15 - going to be just the current user and
229:18 - now I should be able to have the actual
229:20 - data let me just run the project once
229:24 - again or it's actually running right now
229:28 - so I have created this user and I have
229:30 - the value but I need to initialize it
229:32 - inside this widgets like Circle text
229:35 - because right now as you can see we have
229:36 - only the hard the hard coded value so
229:39 - here inside the background image I will
229:42 - once again use the cached Network image
229:45 - provider and the URL is going to be just
229:48 - uh this
229:50 - user. profile picture the next is going
229:53 - to be just a display name and it will
229:56 - have this user do display name the next
230:00 - one is and the final one is going to be
230:01 - the username so we will have the
230:04 - username
230:05 - here and let me also just put some cons
230:08 - here because we will be able to get rid
230:11 - of this blue warnings which slow down
230:14 - the
230:20 - tempter okay so now we can see that we
230:23 - have the actual value the perect picture
230:25 - display name and the username so
230:26 - everything is working perfectly fine and
230:30 - I also want to have a button here that
230:31 - let me just uh uh you know navigate back
230:35 - and have a navigation. pop to the
230:38 - previous page that I came from here to
230:40 - this page so let me just create that one
230:43 - as well and for doing it you know I just
230:46 - need to take everything from the circle
230:48 - Avatar to this uh text at the end and
230:51 - first of all I need to create a row and
230:55 - I will paste it again
231:01 - here and again I will take all of
231:09 - this and create a new column and paste
231:13 - it again right here but before that
231:16 - inside the row I want to have an icon
231:21 - button the unpress is going to be just
231:23 - something like uh navigation. pop uh I
231:27 - mean Navigator pop which it will just
231:30 - let us to get back to the previous pitch
231:33 - and then the icon is going to be just
231:34 - something like icons. Arrow
231:41 - back and now I have this
231:45 - um actually the UI is not really looking
231:48 - very nice now I just need to bring it
231:50 - once again to the
231:52 - center so let me just have a look at
231:58 - it okay so I really don't know what's
232:02 - wrong here so I will just uh you know
232:04 - fix this uh UI prob later on so we don't
232:07 - need to focus on this one right now I
232:09 - will just change this uh
232:12 - Arrow or I would just change it
232:14 - everything is good I will change I will
232:16 - just fix this UI uh problem later on for
232:20 - now I don't have to focus on this and
232:22 - when I click on this I will be navigated
232:24 - back to this hom
232:25 - page so this is also working well and
232:29 - inside the hom page exactly this page
232:31 - all you want to show the data that we
232:34 - get from the fire back which is going to
232:35 - give you the videos so now we can work
232:39 - on that one let me just open this post
232:42 - so we are trying to
232:46 - creat this post which is uh as I said
232:48 - before is going to be our thumbnail
232:50 - title and exactly the first thing that
232:52 - the users will see when they are on the
232:54 - F uh F
232:56 - screen
233:00 - okay and let me just uh put this post
233:04 - inside this screen that I want to be
233:08 - seeing it which is going to be just uh
233:11 - the video screen
233:16 - so here I need to create a new file to
233:18 - just call it long video
233:26 - screen and I will just UT the material.
233:29 - dart and then create an scaffold to just
233:32 - call it video I mean long video
233:41 - screen create the scaffold and inside
233:44 - the body I will just have a
233:54 - column okay so now I need to put this
233:58 - long video screen inside actually the
234:01 - body of the homepage or I should just
234:06 - say let me open this Pages uh
234:11 - file in the first page I want to have
234:14 - the this long video screen page and
234:16 - instead of just having a text like this
234:18 - to say home I want to have the actual
234:21 - page of long video
234:24 - screen and this is going to be the first
234:27 - page and for now it's just empty so
234:29 - let's work on it and inside the long
234:32 - video screen I can just have you know an
234:36 - stream Builder which inside I show the
234:38 - post so let me just remove this column
234:41 - and instead I can have and stream
234:45 - Builder because I want to show the
234:47 - actual data using this stream Builder
234:50 - and the stream is going to be just
234:56 - Firebase so I will just create an
234:58 - instance of Firebase
235:03 - firer then I will go inside the
235:06 - collection of
235:08 - videos then I'm not going to just
235:11 - specify a doc because I want to just get
235:14 - all all the documents so I'm going to
235:15 - just say
235:17 - snapshots I want to just go to let me
235:20 - just explain it to you I want to just go
235:22 - through the collection of videos and
235:24 - then get a snapshot of all documents
235:27 - inside this
235:30 - collection okay then we have a
235:33 - builder and what I want to do here is
235:36 - actually to return you know a list view.
235:42 - Builder and that's
235:48 - it inside this uh you know list be do
235:52 - Builder I want to just return a
235:56 - post and this list. Builder also has an
235:59 - item count but for now it's going to be
236:01 - just something like one I just want to
236:03 - show one post because I don't have the
236:06 - actual value and it's going to be just
236:09 - uh right for now because right now we
236:12 - don't have an actual value but later on
236:15 - when we added the value it would be much
236:17 - great so let me just run the
236:21 - project okay so that's what we are
236:24 - seeing right now and I will just
236:26 - minimize the vs code that we can see it
236:28 - and this uh picture is this post and
236:33 - this cach network image that we just
236:35 - created inside the post as I said to you
236:37 - the first thing that the users will see
236:39 - inside this video screen will be the
236:41 - thumbnail the title and just this page
236:44 - so this post is exactly the first thing
236:46 - that the users will see when uh they
236:48 - want to click on a video and they when
236:50 - they click on this post they will be
236:52 - navigated to the video which we will
236:54 - created that one as well but first let's
236:56 - work on this post so the next thing
236:59 - after showing this image is going to be
237:01 - just the profile picture and that stuff
237:04 - and for doing it first of all I need to
237:07 - create a row I believe and then inside
237:10 - the row I want to show a circle aor I
237:13 - mean I need to show the purple picture
237:15 - inside a circle AAR so let me just
237:18 - create this it has a radius of something
237:21 - like 20 and
237:24 - then it has a background color of
237:31 - gray and after that I want to show the
237:34 - profile pck I mean I want to show
237:36 - the display name or actually I don't
237:40 - want to show the display name but I want
237:42 - to show the title of the video which in
237:44 - this case going to be just any title
237:47 - it's just hardcoded for now I can just
237:49 - save once again first video
237:53 - here so this is going to be
237:55 - the the title of the video and I also
237:59 - want to show just an icon button here I
238:03 - want to have an icon at the end of this
238:05 - page and the icon is going to be just
238:08 - something like uh yeah this is the name
238:11 - of the icon more word and it's just
238:13 - three do
238:15 - uh upon each other in the actual YouTube
238:18 - we have this icon in the thumbnail so I
238:20 - also want to have this now let me just
238:24 - do something like uh I want to change
238:26 - the main axis alignment of this row and
238:31 - we will have a main AIS alignment of
238:33 - space between and this way or actually
238:36 - not a space between but I can put it a
238:40 - start and then have a spacer between uh
238:44 - for this icon so I will just do it like
238:47 - this okay I just Chang the main access
238:50 - alignment to start because we want to
238:52 - have everything at the beginning but
238:53 - later on add a spor to just put away
238:57 - this icon at the end of this
239:00 - row okay now let me just do some
239:04 - customization here for example adding a
239:06 - padding to this
239:08 - title so let me just wrap it with a
239:12 - padding and I will give just a padding
239:15 - from the left side a padding of
239:17 - something like 10 and now it looks
239:21 - beautiful and I also want to change the
239:24 - text uh style of this title because it
239:28 - needs to be something like uh first of
239:31 - all it has to be
239:33 - bold maybe that's okay for
239:36 - now and after this row at a continuous
239:38 - to the column I want to show the display
239:41 - name of the user who uploaded this video
239:43 - the the number of views and also dead
239:45 - published so let me just uh create maybe
239:49 - another
239:53 - row so the next inside this row I just
239:56 - need to create the display name and
239:58 - number of views and did published so let
240:01 - me just first of all create a display
240:03 - name which is going to be Ahmed amini
240:06 - and then I can
240:07 - also just create the number of views for
240:10 - now and for now it's going to be just
240:12 - say new because initially number of
240:15 - views is equal to zero and when the user
240:17 - clicks on the video uh it will just
240:20 - increment and then I can also create the
240:23 - de publish which uh now I'm going to
240:25 - just say like a moment
240:28 - ago okay that's all right and now you
240:31 - can see it's like this and let me just
240:34 - give it a
240:34 - padding it just needs some customize uh
240:38 - it just needs some customize to look
240:40 - beautiful
240:45 - and I will give it a padding like
240:46 - symmetric and then horizontally a
240:49 - padding of
240:50 - eight the next I also need to change uh
240:53 - you know the background I I also just
240:56 - need to change the color of this text so
240:59 - I will give it all a color of blue
241:12 - gray and now now it looks like this and
241:15 - let me just uh wrap this row with a
241:18 - padding as well to just uh you know give
241:23 - it a padding from the left side and I
241:25 - will just use the media query for this
241:28 - uh for doing this purpose and I will
241:31 - have I will use this media query do size
241:35 - of context and
241:37 - then W and I can just use something like
241:41 - 0.1
241:44 - let's see yeah I think it looks great
241:47 - let me just do something like
241:49 - 0.2 and now that's much
241:53 - better so now I have this and let me
241:57 - also just you know give it some padding
241:59 - to this profile picture because it's not
242:01 - really looking very nice and for doing
242:04 - it I'm going to just wrap this circle I
242:06 - was already
242:07 - padding I can have a padding from the
242:10 - top side like four and also from the
242:12 - left side four
242:14 - five and now uh you know I will give it
242:18 - a padding of eight from the top side so
242:20 - now it looks perfect and we have this uh
242:24 - we have
242:25 - this uh Network image we have this
242:28 - thumbnail perfect picture uh title and
242:32 - this stuff and now I want to give it the
242:35 - actual value instead of just some
242:37 - hardcoded and for doing it I need to
242:41 - have you know I just need to get
242:44 - the value of this and I will just use a
242:46 - parameter so I will have a video
242:51 - model and I will call it a video and
242:54 - then I will generate Constructor for it
242:57 - but before it let me just uh have the
243:00 - actual value of video here and it's
243:02 - going to be just the
243:04 - video and now inside this stream Builder
243:08 - when I get the data so first of all uh
243:11 - let me just check some if you're already
243:13 - familiar how to work with stream
243:14 - Builders you know that uh we can check
243:17 - some conditions here that if we got the
243:19 - data if the data is loading and when we
243:21 - have the actual data we just want to
243:23 - show and display this list view. Builder
243:26 - that we return the actual data which is
243:28 - going to be a list of
243:30 - videos first of all I just want to check
243:33 - if the data is not equal if the data if
243:36 - the data is equal to null so I'm going
243:37 - to just say if the snapshot the data is
243:40 - equal to null in this case I want to
243:43 - just return you know an error
243:48 - page because we don't have any edor and
243:51 - else I want to just
243:54 - check if the data is loading so I will
243:57 - just say if a snapshot. connection set
244:00 - is equal
244:02 - to connection set. waiting it means that
244:05 - we don't have uh the data yet it mean
244:08 - the data is loading which in this case I
244:09 - want to just return
244:11 - the loader pitch
244:16 - and actually I don't want to check it
244:18 - like this snap the data is equal to n
244:21 - but um a safer way to do it is just to
244:23 - say snapshot. has data is not true so
244:27 - this is a more safer way to say if we
244:29 - don't have the data it doesn't matter if
244:32 - it is null or it is any other case but
244:35 - if it don't have the data I just want to
244:36 - show that this's error pitch and we
244:38 - don't care why we don't have the the
244:40 - data but in this case we only want to sh
244:43 - the error p
244:44 - and when we have the data it's not
244:47 - loading in this case only we want to
244:49 - return this list without Builder inside
244:51 - this stream Builder inside the function
244:54 - I want to just uh first of all get the
244:56 - actual data right here so I will just
244:59 - say snapshot the
245:01 - data and then docs so this docs is going
245:06 - to be just so what I what actually I'm
245:08 - doing is just to say snapshot the data
245:10 - which in this case the data is going to
245:12 - be a collection of videos so then I get
245:15 - the docs which is all documents it means
245:17 - all the videos I can just store it
245:20 - inside a variable called video Maps so I
245:24 - have this video
245:25 - maps and then I can do a map and I get
245:30 - each video right
245:32 - now and now that I have each video I
245:36 - want to use the video model do from map
245:41 - and the map is going to be just the
245:43 - video. data so now I have this and I'm
245:47 - going to just return
245:49 - this and finally converted into a list
245:54 - so I hope now I have this list of
245:59 - videos yeah now I have a list of video
246:01 - model so what I actually did was that
246:04 - first of all I used this I Snapchat the
246:06 - data and then I got all the docs it
246:09 - means all the videos which are going to
246:11 - be a list of cury document sshot and
246:13 - then I stored it inside this video maps
246:17 - and then I use this map to go through
246:20 - each of the videos and then use the FR
246:23 - map to convert that into a video model
246:26 - and then finally convert all of them
246:27 - into a list and store it inside this
246:29 - variable
246:30 - videos so now inside this l. Builder
246:33 - instead of uh having this one as a
246:36 - hardcoded uh number I can just use this
246:38 - videos do
246:41 - length and the video is going to be
246:44 - just
246:46 - videos index let me just remove this
246:49 - cons and everything should be good so
246:52 - now let me just do a hot
246:56 - restart and if you don't have any error
246:58 - it should be per it should be working
247:00 - perfectly
247:02 - fine actually we got some error here so
247:04 - let me just uh find we have something
247:07 - imported like dart. GS which I need to
247:10 - remove that yeah this is going to be
247:13 - that let me just remove that and do how
247:15 - to start once again it just says that
247:18 - type time stop is not a subtype of dat
247:21 - time in the typ cast so we got some
247:24 - error type we got some type
247:28 - errors and let me just find it where we
247:30 - have this error to resolve
247:35 - it so to resolve this error I just need
247:37 - to change this from map method inside
247:40 - the video model and just remove this uh
247:44 - stuff from the publish and replace what
247:47 - I'm writing
247:49 - here okay so this would be working and
247:52 - now when I open the emulator you can see
247:53 - that there is no error so let me just do
247:55 - a how Restort once again just make sure
247:58 - to replace this code instead of that and
248:02 - everything is good up to now and the
248:04 - error is gone let me just open the post
248:07 - one second so here I just need
248:09 - to replace this hardcoded codes with the
248:12 - actual dat which is going to be this
248:14 - video okay first of all I will just show
248:17 - the profile picture and instead of this
248:19 - I can just
248:20 - say video
248:23 - do uh thumbnail this is going to be the
248:26 - purle uh I mean this is going to be the
248:28 - thumbnail and it should be uploaded in a
248:31 - moment the next one is going to be the
248:33 - circle aor in which here I just need to
248:36 - show the uh profile picture of the user
248:40 - who uploaded this video so I in in the
248:44 - background image I can just use the
248:45 - cache Network image provider and here
248:47 - I'm going to just say video do uh
248:51 - actually so I'm going to just uh comment
248:54 - this for now I will just do it later on
248:56 - the next one is the title I'm going to
248:59 - just say video.
249:02 - title and remove this cons from
249:05 - here yeah it's great the next one is
249:09 - going to be
249:10 - the number of views and and this is
249:14 - first of all
249:15 - the again the display the display name
249:20 - of the user who is uploading this video
249:23 - and the next one is number of views so I
249:26 - can just say video do
249:30 - views and I have to change it to a
249:34 - string the next one is did publish which
249:36 - for now I'm going to just put it like
249:38 - this so uh What uh else I need to do is
249:42 - to
249:43 - you know find the the display name and
249:47 - the profile picture of the user who
249:49 - uploaded this video and I can just do it
249:51 - really easily because I have the user ID
249:54 - and using this user ID I can find the
249:56 - actual data of the you know Channel who
250:00 - uploaded this video and that is the
250:03 - reason that I just added this user ID as
250:05 - one of the parameters you know as one of
250:07 - the fields inside the video model
250:09 - because using it I want to find the the
250:12 - the the guy who just uploaded this video
250:15 - and it can help us using this user ID so
250:19 - now to initialize the value for the uh
250:21 - display name right here and also for the
250:23 - profile picture of the current user who
250:26 - just uploaded the video I need to create
250:28 - a consumer vidget and for this means I'm
250:30 - going to just change this instead this
250:31 - widget into a consumer
250:33 - widget and I have to just
250:38 - add and I just need to add this fidget
250:41 - drive right here inside the build meod
250:43 - which I'm going to just call the drift
250:45 - so right here I need to create a new
250:47 - provider so I'm going to just open uh
250:50 - user provider and as you can see right
250:53 - now we only have one provider which is
250:54 - going to be for current user provider
250:57 - I'm going to create one new provider
250:59 - which is called any user data provider
251:02 - and why I'm creating this actually there
251:05 - are some times that I don't need to just
251:07 - retrieve the current user but I want to
251:10 - just retrieve any user which is needed
251:12 - exactly like what I need inside this
251:14 - post which uh different users upload
251:18 - different videos and I want to just
251:19 - retrieve the current uh you know uh the
251:22 - display name of the user who uploaded
251:24 - the video and for this case I need to
251:25 - create this any user data provider and
251:28 - there's a difference between this
251:30 - provider and the current user data
251:31 - provider so let me just show it to you
251:34 - because uh first of all I'm going to
251:35 - create a future
251:37 - provider and in this case ref is not the
251:41 - only parameter in the previous providers
251:42 - that you saw we only had one provide uh
251:45 - we had only one parameter which was R
251:48 - and we just used it to connect different
251:50 - providers together but in this case when
251:53 - we are using any user data provider I
251:55 - need to add one more parameter which is
251:57 - going to be just the user ID and if you
252:01 - wonder why I need to add this user ID
252:03 - because as you can
252:05 - see uh when I want to retrieved for
252:08 - example the display name of the current
252:09 - user it asks me for a user ID and for
252:12 - this case I need to just initialize this
252:14 - user ID and pass it as a parameter uh in
252:17 - this provider and for this means I don't
252:20 - uh I cannot just use a simple feature
252:22 - provider but I need to use something
252:24 - like feature provider. family and using
252:27 - this family I can just add a new
252:29 - parameter so I just need to create this
252:32 - feature provider but that's not just a
252:34 - simple feature provider I need to add a
252:36 - family right here and right now I can
252:39 - add my second argument which is going to
252:41 - be the user ID
252:45 - now once again I can just use this uh
252:48 - fetch current user data or I should just
252:50 - create a new method because this fetch
252:52 - current user data is just only
252:55 - retrieving as the current user data but
252:57 - I want to retrieve any user data using a
252:59 - user ID and I just don't want to have
253:02 - this uh uid as the current user but it
253:06 - should be any user ID so I can just copy
253:09 - this uh method and paste it right here
253:13 - exactly here and I'm going to just uh uh
253:17 - add something like
253:19 - fetch any user data provider so let me
253:22 - just remove this current and this method
253:25 - is called Fetch any user
253:27 - data and in this case I don't want the
253:30 - uid to be the current user uid but it
253:33 - should be the user ID which I'm going to
253:35 - just pass it as
253:37 - parameter okay everything is okay right
253:40 - now and here I'm going to just say ref
253:43 - and then I can use the watch method to
253:45 - use
253:47 - this uh let me come here I'm going to
253:50 - just use this user data service
253:54 - provider and finally the uh fetch any
253:59 - user data and the user ID in this case
254:02 - is going to be just user ID and I'm
254:04 - going to just initialize it inside the
254:06 - post widget so everything is okay and
254:10 - when I get this uh it gives me a result
254:12 - of user
254:14 - model which I'm going to just call it
254:17 - user and I will also AWA
254:19 - this and make this method a sness and
254:22 - finally I can just return this user from
254:25 - this provider and everything should be
254:27 - okay now inside the post I need to you
254:31 - know inside this consumer widget use
254:33 - this RI to just you know retrieve the
254:37 - this provider so I'm going to just write
254:40 - uh let me see what was this provider any
254:43 - user data provider I can just use this
254:46 - and also let me just import
254:48 - it and when I use this provider it asks
254:52 - for a parameter because as you can see
254:54 - we added this uh extra parameter which
254:56 - is going to be the user ID ref is okay
254:59 - but I need to initialize this user ID
255:02 - and this user ID is going to be just
255:05 - video. user ID this is the user ID that
255:09 - I need to use and I'm going to just
255:11 - store this inside a variable called user
255:15 - model
255:17 - but this user model is not just a simple
255:20 - user model it is an asingle value so I'm
255:24 - going to also just write here that the
255:26 - type of this user model is
255:28 - this it is just not a simple user model
255:31 - it is a single value and later on I can
255:34 - just say user model and then I'm going
255:37 - to just use I'm not going to use when
255:39 - because I don't need that I'm going to
255:41 - just say when data and this method just
255:44 - gives us the data when we have it and
255:46 - it's not just checking the uh time when
255:49 - we we got error or for example the data
255:51 - is loading so it it doesn't care about
255:52 - that and it will only give us the data
255:55 - whenever we have it so I'm going to just
255:57 - use this when
255:59 - data and of course we get a value which
256:02 - is going to be just the user model so
256:05 - I'm going to just say user and finally I
256:07 - can just return this user so what
256:11 - basically I did was I I use this user
256:13 - model and I said whenever we get the
256:15 - data uh which is going to be which the
256:17 - data is going to be just a user I want
256:19 - the user to be returned and the result
256:22 - of this is going to be the actual user
256:24 - model that I
256:25 - need so I'm going to just call it user
256:28 - so let me see if there's an
256:30 - error and it says that a value of type
256:33 - aing value cannot be assigned to
256:35 - variable of type user
256:38 - model so I'm going to not I will not say
256:41 - it is a type of user model let me just
256:43 - use this user and actually I can use
256:47 - this user to initialize the values and I
256:49 - will first of all use it
256:53 - here I'm going to say value and display
256:56 - name you just need to use this value to
256:58 - get the actual value of this because
257:00 - it's an async
257:02 - value and now it's okay so this was the
257:05 - display name and I also need to
257:07 - initialize this uh uh per picture right
257:11 - here inside this circle aat it has
257:12 - another property called background image
257:15 - and I'm going to just use cache Network
257:17 - image provider and
257:19 - finally uh user. value. profile
257:24 - pick it's okay let me just remove this
257:26 - cons and add an exclamation mark right
257:28 - here so now everything should be okay
257:31 - let me just reformat The Code by putting
257:33 - some commas here and also I'll put some
257:36 - cons right here and
257:39 - here and also I will change the value of
257:42 - this uh which is going to be for uh the
257:45 - date published later on I will also
257:46 - change that but for now we don't need to
257:48 - care about it so everything should be
257:51 - okay and let me just run the emulator to
257:53 - check it
258:00 - out and as you can see everything is
258:02 - working and we are getting the first
258:04 - post which is going to be the title
258:06 - first video on a platform this is the
258:08 - display name this is the actual number
258:11 - of views and also I'm going to just say
258:13 - uh I just need to mention that this is
258:15 - the number of views so let me just open
258:17 - this
258:18 - post
258:20 - and this is uh where I need to show the
258:23 - number of views let me just take this I
258:25 - will use this string and later on like
258:28 - this I will say that this is a number of
258:32 - views actually not here but right here
258:37 - so now it also says that that's uh we
258:39 - got zero views and whenever we got zero
258:42 - views I can simply say no views so let
258:45 - me just uh do this as
258:47 - well I'm going to just uh have a
258:50 - condition right here to say you know
258:52 - whenever the views is equal to zero I
258:55 - want to I want to just display something
258:57 - like no views but if it is not equal to
258:59 - zero I just want to show and display the
259:02 - actual number of views in this post so
259:05 - let me just say video do
259:09 - views and if this is equal to zero in
259:14 - this case I'm going to just
259:16 - say no view but if it it is not right in
259:21 - this case I'm going to say and now that
259:24 - should be all right and as you can see
259:26 - for now we are getting no view because
259:28 - there is no VI in this post so this is
259:30 - basically the post we show a thumbnail
259:33 - and then we show profile picture title
259:35 - display name and number of views and
259:36 - also that did published but now what I
259:39 - want to do is whenever I click on this
259:41 - post I want it to be navigated inside a
259:44 - video and there I can just actually
259:47 - display the actual video that the user
259:50 - uploaded so let's work on this and
259:53 - create the
259:54 - video so let me just open this uh video
259:58 - and this is the starting code for this
260:01 - file and uh first of all I want to just
260:05 - uh create the navigation to this page
260:07 - whenever the user clicks on the post so
260:10 - I'm going to just uh wrap the this
260:13 - column with a gesture.
260:15 - detector to just say whenever user
260:19 - clicks on it I want to get a navigation
260:21 - to the video and let me just create this
260:31 - navigation okay so now when I click on
260:34 - this thumbnail we are just navigated to
260:36 - this page which is going to be the video
260:38 - and I will upload everything here uh and
260:41 - here I just need to display the actual
260:43 - video that which the user just uploaded
260:46 - and I'm going to just close all the an
260:49 - necessary pages so inside this video as
260:53 - you can see everything that we have uh
260:56 - right now for example the video is
260:58 - inside this app bar because I want to
261:00 - display it right here and then uh I will
261:03 - display some other stuff inside the body
261:05 - of this
261:07 - video okay so first of all let me just
261:11 - uh display the actual video inside uh
261:15 - here and for doing it I need to just
261:17 - import the video player package which
261:19 - I'm going to use in this uh project so
261:23 - let me just import it and first of all
261:26 - you have to install the package inside
261:27 - your pu. file and then you can use this
261:30 - package to display the
261:32 - video so let me just uh show you this
261:35 - video player package I'm going to just
261:37 - open
261:38 - it uh this is the video player package
261:41 - for the flutter and we are using it so
261:44 - let me just open the documentation and
261:45 - of course you can just use this
261:47 - documentation to learn how to use this
261:49 - package inside your PL project and as
261:52 - you can see first you need to add some
261:56 - installation and it asks for some
261:58 - permission for Android and also for the
262:00 - iOS so in my case I need to add this
262:03 - permission inside my Android project
262:05 - inside the Android manifest file uh and
262:08 - I believe that I already have added this
262:10 - package which basically it asks for an
262:12 - it asks for an internet uh permission
262:16 - let me just open the Android manifest
262:18 - file and I'm uh I just believe that I
262:20 - have already added this uh as you can
262:22 - see this permission inside the under
262:25 - manifest fault so just make sure to add
262:27 - the necessary permissions for your
262:28 - Android or if you have an iOS you just
262:31 - need to add the necessary permissions
262:33 - for your
262:35 - iOS okay so when you're done with this
262:38 - installation and you're good you can
262:40 - just continue and let's come to this
262:42 - example and as you can uh see here the
262:45 - first thing uh yeah here we can just
262:48 - find everything necessary for
262:50 - installation of this package and the
262:52 - first thing that I need to do is to just
262:55 - uh initialize this package inside my in
262:58 - so I'm going to just copy
263:00 - this this is everything for any solution
263:03 - and I will just create let me close this
263:06 - page first of all I will change this
263:08 - stess fidget into a stateful fidget and
263:11 - then I can create an in
263:14 - set so you are already I'm sure that
263:16 - you're already familiar with using this
263:18 - in set whenever we open the page for the
263:20 - first time this everything inside this
263:23 - in set will be triggered and I'm going
263:25 - to just uh copy everything right here
263:27 - and I need to create a controller so I'm
263:29 - going to say
263:31 - final video player controller and of
263:35 - course as you can see this video player
263:37 - controller is from the package video
263:40 - player
263:44 - and it's not of course final and I will
263:47 - also add an this Mark here to say that
263:50 - electron I will surely initialize this
263:52 - video player
263:54 - controller okay and then using this
263:57 - controller I can initialize this video
264:00 - player and what we have basically done
264:02 - is we said uh video player controller
264:05 - and then uh I did it using this nwork
264:08 - URL because we are getting this uh you
264:11 - know video from Network URL which of
264:13 - course in our case it is from the
264:15 - Firebase and this is going to be the
264:17 - video later on I will just change it to
264:18 - a real video but for now we are just
264:21 - using this uh Sample video from the
264:24 - package which is just uh a short video
264:28 - and then I initialize it and finally
264:31 - doing a seta set so uh using this our
264:34 - video player will be initialized and
264:36 - then I can just display the actual video
264:40 - and for doing it right now as you can
264:42 - see see I have only a container but
264:44 - instead of a container I can actual I
264:46 - can display the actual video right
264:49 - here so let me see where should I just
264:52 - uh display this video I believe I can
264:56 - display it right uh here or maybe not so
265:00 - let me just check it once so I can just
265:03 - display the video right here and I can
265:05 - just say uh video
265:10 - player and here I just need to
265:12 - initialize the controller which in this
265:13 - case is controller and I need to put an
265:16 - exclamation mark and of course I'm going
265:18 - to just uh I need to wrap this uh stack
265:22 - widget I believe with an aspect ratio uh
265:26 - this is the highest widget inside this
265:29 - appb so let me just wrap this with a
265:31 - aspect ratio and the aspect ratio for
265:34 - this uh widget is going to be just the
265:37 - aspect ratio of the video that we have
265:39 - so I'm going to just say uh actually I
265:41 - don't need to put the aspect ratio right
265:43 - here maybe I should do it just inside
265:46 - the video so I'm going to just wrap this
265:47 - video player with aspect
265:50 - ratio and the aspect ratio in here will
265:53 - be just the aspect ratio of this video
265:54 - so I'm going to just say controller.
265:56 - value. aspect ratio and I believe that's
265:59 - all
266:00 - right okay then uh right here it should
266:04 - just display the video and as you can
266:06 - see this is the video of a b and this is
266:08 - just the sample video of the a sample
266:11 - video which this video player package
266:13 - use it as a default and later on I can
266:16 - just replace it with the actual video
266:18 - which I have inside my database but for
266:20 - now it's going to be
266:22 - okay and for now let me just customize
266:25 - this page to make it a little more
266:29 - beautiful okay so I'm going to just
266:31 - minimize this wh that you can see it
266:33 - properly and here you can see the
266:35 - emulator and see the changes in real
266:38 - time so this is the title and uh let me
266:41 - just wrap this whole uh let me just wrap
266:44 - this title with a padding so I will give
266:47 - it a padding from the right side and we
266:49 - are having a padding only from the left
266:51 - side which is going to be a padding of
266:54 - 10 or maybe a padding of 12 okay then we
266:58 - have a number of views but beside number
267:01 - of views I also want to show the that
267:04 - publish time so we can see that when we
267:06 - publish this video
267:08 - so right here I can just copy it and
267:12 - paste it one more time and here I'm
267:13 - going to just say for example five
267:16 - minutes
267:17 - ago it's just the date published of this
267:23 - video and actually I don't need like
267:25 - this padding so I'm going to just say a
267:27 - padding of four from the left side and
267:30 - also here a patting of uh four from the
267:33 - right side so it's going to be
267:36 - okay and then I also want to wrap uh so
267:41 - I also want to have a pad from the top
267:42 - side for this row and I will give it a
267:45 - padding of something like eight and I
267:47 - think it should be a pading of five and
267:49 - I think that's all right okay then here
267:53 - we have the purle picture so this is
267:55 - exactly this circle aor I need to just
267:58 - uh make it a little bigger this profile
268:00 - picture and then we have this display
268:02 - name of the user who uploaded this video
268:05 - which is uh here like ah it's just a
268:08 - hardcoded and then we have the Subscribe
268:11 - button but before that I also want to
268:12 - show the number of subscribers that this
268:15 - user has so I'm going to just have one
268:18 - more text to say like for example one
268:22 - subscriptions okay and I just need to
268:24 - change
268:25 - the style of
268:27 - this
268:31 - text I will just first of all give it a
268:34 - Fone size of something like 15 and also
268:36 - I will change the fot we
268:38 - to something like w500
268:47 - okay and then I can just wrap it with a
268:49 - padding to give it a padding from the
268:51 - right
268:55 - side and it's going to be just a padding
268:58 - of
269:00 - six okay everything is good I just need
269:03 - to add a spacer here because I want this
269:06 - uh subscribe button to be at the end and
269:08 - right now it is great and let me also
269:11 - give it a padding from the left side uh
269:13 - and it's going to be just a padding of
269:16 - six or maybe yeah that's all right I can
269:19 - have just a padding like this but the
269:21 - phone size I think it should be
269:22 - something like tur because it's yeah I
269:25 - think that's right now looking very well
269:28 - so this is the video page and later on I
269:31 - can also add something like a comment
269:33 - section because I want to have I want to
269:36 - display all the comments right here and
269:39 - I'm not going to work on it for now let
269:41 - me just work on this likes button
269:43 - because it's not looking very nice uh
269:46 - let me just find it yeah here we have
269:49 - this uh thumb up and also we have this
269:51 - thumb down but first of all let me just
269:54 - increase the width between these two I'm
269:56 - going to just give it a BD of like
270:00 - 15 and it should be inside a container
270:04 - and I believe I can add and increase
270:07 - this vertical uh padding of this
270:09 - container to something like 15
270:14 - okay I think it looks better now let me
270:18 - also increase this weight a little more
270:20 - to something like
270:21 - 19 and now it should be better and when
270:25 - this video is liked I want this I want
270:28 - to just change the color of this th app
270:29 - but for now it's
270:31 - okay so now we have this and uh this is
270:34 - the video this is the title of video
270:36 - number of views that published profile
270:38 - picture of the user who uploaded this
270:40 - video display name number of
270:42 - subscriptions for the user uploaded and
270:44 - also we have a subscribe button and also
270:46 - we can like this video or unlike this
270:49 - video and also we have some other
270:50 - buttons and first of all let me just
270:53 - give a padding to this title okay so I'm
270:56 - going to just give it a padding from the
270:58 - top side and just a padding of four not
271:01 - more okay now it should be great and
271:03 - also this padding to turn right now it
271:06 - looks great and everything is good okay
271:10 - now the UI looks very good and let me
271:13 - just uh improve the user experience of
271:15 - this uh video whenever we click on a
271:19 - video I want some icons to appear
271:22 - because it's exactly like we have in the
271:24 - actual YouTube when you click on a video
271:26 - you can just for example pause or play
271:28 - the video you can move uh ahead or you
271:31 - can move just uh backwards so this is
271:33 - all the features that we have in the
271:35 - actual YouTube and I'll uh I just want
271:37 - to implement this inside my uh project
271:40 - that whenever I click on this some icons
271:42 - should appear and then I will be able to
271:44 - play the video and do some more
271:46 - stuff so let me just create
271:49 - them and first of all I will just remove
271:53 - this unnecessary inputs and then here I
271:56 - can just have some variables that I will
271:58 - use and the first one is going to be a
272:00 - bullion of uh is show icons so as I said
272:06 - I want to be able to show the icon and
272:08 - also just appear or disappear the icons
272:11 - whenever the user clicks on the whenever
272:13 - the user clicks on this video and then I
272:17 - also want to have a Boolean to say is
272:19 - playing so whe whether the video is
272:22 - playing or it is not playing and that's
272:25 - all right so first of all let me just
272:27 - work on this is show icons and I will
272:29 - just display some icons whenever I click
272:32 - on this video and first of all let me
272:34 - just create this icons which are just
272:37 - some images that I already have inside
272:39 - the assets of my folder as you can can
272:42 - see inside the assets I have icons and
272:44 - also I have images and of course once
272:46 - again if you have downloaded this
272:48 - project you have access to all of them
272:50 - and I will just use some of the images
272:52 - inside my project to display this play
272:55 - icon pause icon go ahead and go backward
272:58 - icons so what I basically want to do is
273:01 - to wrap this video
273:04 - player with a gesture
273:07 - detector or maybe I have already done it
273:10 - yeah I have this gesture detector to
273:13 - this whole
273:15 - video and right here I'm going to just
273:19 - say that if is show icons is equal to
273:23 - false in this case for example I want to
273:26 - display icons and whenever x equal to
273:29 - false I want to disappeared icons so let
273:32 - me just do like this that whenever s
273:35 - show icons is equal to false I want to
273:38 - display the icons inside this method and
273:41 - if if it is not equal to uh true I will
273:44 - do this method
273:46 - okay first of all if s ions is equal to
273:50 - true it means that we have the icons I
273:52 - want to just disappear them and when we
273:54 - don't have them I want to appear this
273:56 - icons but now first of all let's have
273:59 - those icons uh we have some stack
274:02 - widgets here this is the first one this
274:03 - is the next one so here I'm going to
274:07 - just in set of this container I can show
274:10 - the actual value and here I'm going to
274:13 - just display the icon of playing that
274:16 - whenever user clicks on it they will be
274:17 - able to play the video so I'm going to
274:20 - just uh use an image. assets and then I
274:23 - will just say assets and then inside it
274:26 - inside the images folder I can just show
274:28 - this
274:30 - play.png okay and this is the icon that
274:33 - we have it here so let me just change
274:35 - the color of this and I will change it
274:37 - to a color of
274:40 - white and now you can see it properly
274:43 - let me just change this to for example
274:45 - something like
274:46 - 170 and also the top should be something
274:49 - like 82 or maybe I should increase it
274:53 - yeah I believe right now it looks
274:56 - better so this is the first for playing
274:59 - the video and the next I also want to be
275:01 - able to uh head backward and also uh hit
275:06 - go forward so let me just create that
275:09 - one as well I will just copy this
275:12 - position and copy it two more times this
275:16 - uh this one is going to be for backward
275:18 - and next one is going to be for
275:19 - forward and it's just assets images and
275:23 - inside that I have go go back final and
275:28 - also the next one is going to be just go
275:31 - ahead final inside this I can just have
275:34 - go ahead final and of course I will need
275:38 - to change this
275:40 - positions for example will make it
275:42 - something like 30 and also this one do
275:46 - like uh let me say from the right side
275:49 - something like three so you can just uh
275:53 - do some stuff to have some trials and
275:55 - errors to find the exact positions of
275:57 - this three icons and it will of course
276:00 - take some time to have the exact
276:01 - position but later on you can have the
276:04 - uh you can just put it whatever you want
276:07 - so I can just increase it to something
276:09 - like 45 this one and also from the top
276:12 - side I want it to be like
276:15 - 85 or maybe I should increase it even
276:18 - more like something like
276:19 - 96 and this one to
276:22 - 55 so as I said before with some trials
276:25 - and errors you will understand the exact
276:27 - position of each one of
276:29 - them and also let me change this one I
276:32 - mean this one to something like 55 and
276:35 - also actually not 55 so I will just put
276:39 - it like 45 or maybe
276:42 - for8 and I can also change this one to
276:45 - like 94 so with some trials and errors
276:48 - you will find the exact position to have
276:50 - this icons and later on I also can
276:52 - organize it much more to make it more
276:54 - beautiful but for now it is okay now I
276:57 - want to be able to appear or disappear
276:59 - the icons whenever the user clicks on
277:01 - this video so I'm going to just select
277:04 - this uh exactly right here I believe
277:08 - that FS show icons is equal to true in
277:12 - this case I want to disappear the icon
277:15 - and for doing it I can just say s show
277:18 - icons should be equal to false and of
277:22 - course I will do a set set so if show
277:24 - can is equal to true I want it to be
277:27 - equal to false and if it is equal to
277:29 - false I will make it equal to
277:33 - true for this icons uh let me just uh
277:37 - make it clear that whenever we want to
277:40 - display this icons so I will wrap I will
277:43 - not wrap I will just only say that if
277:45 - show icons is equal to true I want to
277:47 - display this but if it's equal to false
277:50 - I will just show a size box it means
277:54 - nothing and I will do the same for the
277:56 - next one as well I will only say let me
277:59 - say like this that if s show icons is
278:04 - equal to true I it needs to be displayed
278:06 - but if it's equal to false I only want
278:08 - to have a size box and the next one will
278:12 - be exactly the
278:15 - same and right now when I click on it
278:18 - you can see it appears and when I click
278:20 - on it it will disappear so it's exactly
278:22 - like the YouTube and now I also want to
278:24 - be able to play the video so how can I
278:26 - just make it to play let me just resize
278:29 - the SS code that you can see the code
278:31 - properly I will create a meod right here
278:34 - to say you know first of all toggle
278:37 - video player
278:42 - so in toggle video player I will say if
278:45 - the video is playing I want it to be
278:47 - paused and if the video is paused I want
278:49 - it to be played for example right now
278:51 - the video is paused so when I click on
278:52 - it it should play the video but if it is
278:55 - playing the video when I click on it it
278:57 - should just pause the video so how can I
278:59 - do it I will just make a condition to
279:00 - say if I can just use the video player
279:03 - controller for this mean so I'm going to
279:04 - just say controller do value do is
279:09 - playing it just G as if the video is
279:12 - playing or
279:14 - not so I'm going to just say that if the
279:16 - video is playing I need to pause the
279:20 - video but if it is not the case else it
279:23 - means that the video is not playing I
279:26 - need to play the video so how can I make
279:29 - the video to be paused I'm going to just
279:31 - use this controller. value. pause I
279:34 - believe I just need to say actually I
279:36 - don't need the value I'm going to just
279:38 - say pause the video and that's all
279:41 - when the video is playing I want the
279:43 - video to be paused and also I will make
279:46 - a playing equal to false because the
279:48 - video is not playing anymore and I will
279:49 - also do a set it so if you're wondering
279:52 - why do I need this displaying you will
279:53 - see later on because I need to change
279:55 - the UI based on where if the video is
279:58 - playing or not and whenever the video is
280:01 - not playing I want it to be played so I
280:03 - can just use this controller do play the
280:06 - video and again I'm going to just make S
280:08 - playing equal to true and do a set step
280:12 - so now I have this toggle video player
280:14 - and I will just use this method on
280:16 - whenever I click on this play button so
280:18 - it's going to be exactly right
280:21 - here and let me just show it whenever I
280:24 - click on this the video is playing and
280:26 - when I click it again it will just stop
280:29 - the video when I click again it will
280:31 - play the video and when I click it again
280:33 - it will just pause the video for me so
280:35 - this is exactly the behavior that I want
280:37 - to
280:39 - have so now I can also toggle video
280:42 - player and I can just you know make the
280:44 - video to stop and pause and now I also
280:47 - want the video to be go ahead and also
280:50 - go backwards so let me just create some
280:52 - meod for
280:54 - it first of all I will create a meod to
280:57 - say go
280:59 - backward and the next one is going to be
281:01 - go
281:05 - forward so how can I create this
281:07 - Behavior to make the video go backward
281:09 - and also go forward first of all let me
281:11 - just use it so the go back word is going
281:14 - to be used exactly here go back final
281:18 - right here and also in this one for the
281:21 - go ahead final I can just use go forward
281:24 - to create this Behavior I just need to
281:27 - take the position of the video that we
281:29 - are in right now and then I will add a
281:32 - duration to it for example it can be a
281:34 - duration of 1 second or any seconds that
281:36 - I want for example in the actual YouTube
281:39 - we have the functionality to
281:41 - go ahead 5 seconds and also 10 seconds
281:44 - you can change the the settings so uh
281:46 - default it is 10 seconds but of course
281:47 - in this video I'm not going to use like
281:49 - 10 seconds and I will just use one
281:51 - second so if you're not understanding
281:53 - just follow along to get what I'm saying
281:56 - what exactly I need to do is first of
281:58 - all I need to get the position of the
281:59 - video that we are in of course it's a
282:01 - type duration so I'm going to just call
282:04 - this position and then I can use the
282:06 - controller to say value and then
282:10 - position and this position will give us
282:13 - the exact uh position of the video that
282:17 - we are in for example if I have played
282:18 - the video and it is at the half of the
282:20 - video it will say me exactly that we are
282:22 - at this position of the video and it is
282:25 - played and now that I give uh I have
282:28 - access to this position I want to add a
282:31 - duration of for example 1 second to that
282:33 - position so now this position is going
282:35 - to be equal to the position that we had
282:38 - but plus a duration of like one second
282:43 - and then I will just say the controller
282:46 - I will just use this controller and I
282:48 - will use this S2 and this S2 uh method
282:52 - is just a meod from this video player
282:54 - package and it will just make the video
282:57 - to go and jump on a specific part of the
282:59 - video uh which takes an argument of
283:02 - position so I can just tell this video
283:04 - to jump on this part of the video and
283:06 - that part is going to be just this
283:09 - position okay so everything is done for
283:11 - going backward let me just explain to
283:13 - you what again that what I have done
283:15 - here I just use this controller to get
283:18 - the position of the video the video that
283:20 - we are in and then I st it inside this
283:23 - position variable and then I say okay
283:26 - the position the current position that v
283:28 - in plus a duration of 1 second should be
283:31 - stored inside this position so this is
283:32 - the new value of the position and then I
283:34 - just use the seek to method to jump on
283:37 - this new position of the video actually
283:40 - for backward I don't need to use the
283:42 - plus but I need to use the minus because
283:45 - we are not uh going forward we're going
283:48 - backward and then I can exactly do the
283:51 - same for the going forward but with this
283:53 - difference that in this Cas I want to
283:56 - have a plus so we are going forward let
283:59 - me just do a hot rest so click on this
284:02 - and it will just navigate us right here
284:05 - we are also getting some bottom error
284:06 - flows which I need to fix later on as
284:09 - well so as you can see it's working
284:12 - perfectly fine and we have this and also
284:14 - this button should be also working that
284:16 - we can just go forward and also go
284:18 - backward but to see it properly I just
284:21 - need to show a progress indicator right
284:23 - at the end of this page to see on which
284:26 - uh position of the video are we
284:27 - currently in and uh just to see the
284:30 - progress of the video and for doing it I
284:32 - can just create this video progress
284:34 - indicator inside this video
284:36 - screen so as you can see I already have
284:39 - this uh align widget and inside that
284:41 - that I only have a simple container
284:43 - which there is nothing inside it so I
284:45 - can just replace this container with a
284:47 - video progress indicator which of course
284:49 - this uh widget is just uh came from the
284:52 - actual video player package that we just
284:54 - installed and here first of all I need
284:56 - to assign a controller that we can use
284:59 - the controller that we just created and
285:01 - also the all scribing will be equal to
285:04 - true so now it should be good and you
285:07 - can see that right now we have this
285:08 - progress indicator and I just need to
285:10 - bring it down at the bottom of this page
285:13 - but before that let me also uh change
285:15 - some colors of it for example the plate
285:17 - color should be equal to rate
285:20 - so I just change the property called
285:23 - colors and it takes just a video
285:25 - progress colors widget so I just need to
285:28 - add this and right now we have a plate
285:30 - color which I'm going to just use a
285:32 - color of R and also I need to just
285:34 - change the buered color which this one
285:36 - is going to be equal to gray a color of
285:41 - gray so basically this color of red is
285:44 - the color of the video which is just
285:45 - passed on and also the buer color is the
285:48 - color of the progress indicator that we
285:50 - have not seen the video yet so you will
285:52 - understand once we have it okay as you
285:54 - can see this is the video when I just
285:57 - click on it you can see that it just uh
286:00 - goes away and right now this part of the
286:03 - video has been seen and this gray part
286:05 - has not been seen it's okay I just need
286:07 - to just relocate this progress indicator
286:10 - because it's it's not really looking
286:11 - very nice at the top of this video and I
286:14 - want it to be just right there just like
286:16 - the actual YouTube that we have so for
286:20 - doing it I believe that I can you know
286:22 - use a size uh I can just use a position
286:25 - let me just wrap this with a position
286:27 - vdet and then I can just some uh change
286:30 - the top for example to something like Ed
286:35 - but as you might know uh first of all
286:37 - let me just see if it's working or not
286:40 - actually I really don't need uh
286:44 - this position and it should be just
286:46 - working perfectly but I don't know
286:48 - what's the problem now so I have to just
286:50 - relate this video progress indicator and
286:52 - put it exactly right
286:54 - there and I also believe that I can just
286:58 - take this aspect ratio so let me just
286:59 - take this
287:00 - one and instead of that I can just wrap
287:05 - it right here so I'm going to just wrap
287:07 - it with the aspect ratio and then put it
287:09 - right here maybe that just solve the
287:11 - problem yeah it's completely okay and
287:13 - right now we have this progress
287:15 - indicator at the bottom of the video
287:16 - which is really looking very nice and
287:17 - it's exactly like the YouTube and I can
287:19 - just play the video and it's just going
287:22 - on and I can just do like this and using
287:25 - this button I can just go
287:27 - backward so now that everything is set
287:30 - up and I can just play the video we can
287:32 - see the progress indicator right here
287:33 - and everything is just okay let's just
287:36 - uh initialize the actual value what I
287:38 - mean is just let's just use the actual
287:40 - video and also the actual display name
287:42 - profile picture of the user who just
287:44 - uploaded this video and everything so
287:47 - first of all let me just replace this
287:49 - with the actual video so let me just
287:52 - create a Constructor and I can just
287:54 - create a video
287:56 - model and I'm going to just call it the
287:58 - video and I will just generate
288:00 - Constructor for this parameter and I can
288:02 - use this video to get the actual value
288:04 - of this video and instead of just this
288:07 - uh just a hardcoded video which is uh we
288:10 - are getting from the internet I can just
288:12 - replace it with the actual video and I'm
288:15 - going to just say the video URL so this
288:17 - is what we really need and instead of
288:19 - the hardcoded B video we are getting the
288:22 - actual video from our
288:25 - database so right now we are getting
288:27 - this error in the PST because I need to
288:29 - initialize this so let me just
288:32 - initialize the video right here inside
288:34 - the PST and the video is going to be
288:36 - just the video and right now it is okay
288:41 - and everything should be really fine and
288:43 - let me just do a hard
288:47 - Restort when I click on a thumbnail we
288:50 - are navigated to this page and here we
288:53 - should be able to see the video yeah and
288:56 - as you can see this is the video that we
288:58 - just uploaded inside the database and we
289:00 - are seeing the actual video and I can
289:03 - just uh uh play the video and I can just
289:06 - stop the video I can just go
289:09 - backward oh this is just uh is been
289:12 - wrong and uh this is going forward and
289:15 - also this is getting backward so I just
289:18 - need to replace this too so and I can
289:20 - just do it real quick uh inside the
289:24 - video I just need to replace this go
289:26 - forward and also go backward uh Ms this
289:30 - is not going to be go forward it is go
289:33 - let me just see it is not go backward it
289:35 - is the go
289:36 - forward and also the next one it's go
289:40 - backward let me just change it okay and
289:43 - now everything should be good and I this
289:45 - is going forward and also this one is
289:48 - getting backward the video and I can
289:50 - just play it or I can just pause
289:53 - it so now everything is okay and I also
289:56 - need to change this other stuff for
289:59 - example number of views that published
290:01 - and uh title and and other things and
290:05 - first of all let me just change the
290:07 - title and I just uh use the actual title
290:10 - that we have
290:11 - here so let me just do that real
290:15 - quick here we have the title A hardcoded
290:19 - how to learn FL quickly and instead of
290:21 - that I can just use widget. video.
290:25 - tile and the next one is number of views
290:28 - so I can just say use like this to
290:32 - say uh
290:34 - widget do video do views and also here
290:38 - I'm going to just say views that we can
290:40 - understand this is is the number of
290:41 - views because this one is just an
290:43 - integer and right now we have this zero
290:45 - views and again I'm going to just uh
290:48 - give it something like this to
290:50 - say if number of views is equal to zero
290:53 - I just want to display no
290:55 - View and for doing it I can just create
290:58 - a condition once again to say if the
291:01 - widget. video. views is you know
291:06 - something like equal to zero in this
291:08 - case I want to just display no view but
291:12 - if it is not true I just want to display
291:14 - the number of views that we have here
291:16 - and for now it is no View and the next
291:20 - uh so I have this title I have number of
291:22 - views and the next I also want to just
291:25 - change uh number of subscriptions and
291:28 - also the Prof picture and the display
291:30 - name of the user who just uploaded this
291:32 - video and for doing it I need to once
291:36 - again use
291:37 - the uh provider of any user data
291:41 - provider so let me just do that real
291:44 - quick and for doing it I need to change
291:46 - this stateful widget into a consumer
291:48 - stateful
291:49 - widget and of course I will need to inut
291:52 - the FL R part package and I will just
291:55 - add a consumer right
291:58 - here and also a consumer
292:01 - here so now we are able to use the flut
292:04 - R part inside this video and I can just
292:08 - do it inside the build method right here
292:10 - and I will just use ref. watch and also
292:13 - the method that uh the provider I need
292:16 - to use is any user data provider and of
292:19 - course you are just familiar with it and
292:21 - how can we use it it takes a parameter
292:23 - and the parameter here is going to be
292:25 - just a user ID of the uh Channel who
292:28 - just uploaded this video so I can just
292:30 - say vet. video. user
292:34 - ID so now the result of this uh provider
292:38 - is going to be just an async value and
292:41 - of course we know that it is a in sync
292:43 - value of
292:44 - user uh model and now everything should
292:47 - be okay and I'm going to just call it
292:51 - user and now I can just use this user to
292:54 - initialize the actual value of the guy
292:58 - who just uploaded this video first of
293:00 - all I can change the profile picture so
293:02 - I'm going to just change the background
293:03 - image I will use the cache Network image
293:06 - provider and it's going to be just user.
293:11 - do profal
293:13 - p and it should be just all right the
293:16 - next I can change the display name of
293:18 - the channel who uploaded this video so
293:21 - for now it was just a hardcoded Ahmed
293:23 - amini but now we are going to just use
293:24 - the actual value and once again I'm
293:27 - using user. value. display
293:31 - name let's just put an exclamation mark
293:34 - here to say that this value is not going
293:35 - to be null and also I'm going to change
293:38 - the number of subscriptions to let's
293:40 - once again say user. value do number of
293:44 - subscriptions that we have here and
293:48 - let's see what's the problem
293:50 - here yeah of course because uh I just
293:53 - need to change it to something like a
293:54 - string because uh number of
293:56 - subscriptions is a list it is not a
293:58 - string so we can't use directly inside a
294:00 - text and I can just use it like
294:04 - this and I'm going to use a method
294:07 - called lent to give as the actual
294:11 - length of this list of subscriptions and
294:13 - also here I'm going to just write
294:16 - subscriptions and once again I'm going
294:18 - to just take the whole thing to say uh
294:21 - as you can see right now so we are
294:23 - getting this error and it will be just
294:24 - solved I'm going to just say if the
294:26 - number of subscriptions is equal to zero
294:28 - it should just be returned to something
294:30 - like no subscriptions but if it is not
294:32 - equal to zero for example it is one two
294:35 - or it is more than zero we just wanted
294:37 - to show the actual number of
294:39 - subscriptions for it once again I just
294:41 - need to create a condition to say if the
294:44 - user. value. subscriptions is
294:48 - empty so in this case I just want to say
294:52 - something like no
294:57 - subscriptions and let me just put an
294:59 - exclaimation Mark here but if it is not
295:01 - true it means that we have more than one
295:03 - subscriptions I just want to show this
295:07 - and now let me just do a hot restart and
295:09 - everything should be okay okay and we
295:10 - should be able to see the actual values
295:13 - instead of just
295:14 - hardcoded as you can see we are also
295:16 - getting some errors while the data is
295:18 - loading in the post and also the long
295:20 - video screen I will also solve that it
295:22 - is just uh some temporary errors that
295:26 - while we are retrieving the data we get
295:28 - that and also in the video we get that
295:31 - error as well but as you can see we are
295:33 - getting the actual value this is the
295:35 - title first video on a platform this is
295:37 - the actual number of views no view for
295:39 - now this is the purple picture the guy
295:43 - who just uploaded of course the display
295:44 - name is Ahmed amini and also we have no
295:46 - subscriptions and this is the video so
295:48 - that is all right uh but let me also uh
295:52 - add some improvement to the user
295:54 - experience of this video and also post
295:57 - and the first thing that I want to do is
295:59 - to just change whenever we are getting
296:01 - the video uh whenever the data is
296:03 - loading and we getting the video I just
296:05 - want to show a
296:07 - loader let me just find that
296:12 - and it is right here instead of just
296:14 - simply a size box I want to use and
296:18 - return a loader widget here to say okay
296:21 - now it should just return a loader and
296:23 - also I can just wrap it with a
296:25 - padding if we need that as
296:28 - well and I will just give it a padding
296:30 - from the top side and it's going to be a
296:32 - padding of
296:34 - 10 okay now it should be
296:38 - good and let me also this long video
296:41 - screen as you can see we have this uh
296:44 - conditions to say if the data is not if
296:47 - you don't have an uh any data it should
296:49 - just return an error pitch if the data
296:51 - is loading we should have a loader and
296:53 - also when we got the data we want to
296:55 - show a lp. builder so everything is okay
296:57 - right here but maybe it's not okay in
297:00 - the post uh I believe so because uh we
297:04 - are getting the error whenever we upload
297:06 - whenever I do a h rest start I get some
297:08 - temporary errors it means that we need
297:10 - to add some more conditions but this one
297:12 - should be okay and the error should be
297:15 - from this uh part whenever we are
297:18 - retrieving the data so we are saying
297:21 - that if snapshot. has data is uh not
297:24 - true and also let me add one more
297:26 - condition to say or so this is basically
297:29 - just or to say if snapshot the data is
297:33 - equal to null if we got these two cases
297:38 - if the snapshot. has it is not equal to
297:40 - true and also if the snapshot data is
297:43 - equal to true I mean uh if you have both
297:46 - these two cases if snapshot. has data is
297:49 - not true and also if snapshot. data is
297:51 - equal to null in these two cases I just
297:54 - want to return an error pitch and when
297:56 - we are getting the data I mean when we
297:58 - are just uh waiting for the data I just
298:01 - want to return a loader and in other
298:03 - cases whenever we are getting the data I
298:04 - just wanted return as list with Builder
298:07 - so now everything should be okay as you
298:09 - can see we are getting this loader but
298:12 - right now we have the data so it should
298:13 - not be just displaying uh actually I
298:17 - forgot to add one more step because you
298:19 - know whenever we are uploading this
298:21 - video page I should add one more
298:24 - condition to say if the data is
298:26 - initialized if our controller is
298:28 - initialized in that case we want to show
298:30 - the video so let me just create this one
298:32 - as well this is not actually true so I
298:34 - need to just take all of them this
298:37 - padding widget inside which I have a
298:39 - load and I'm going to just uh use once
298:41 - again this size box because that's
298:43 - completely all all right here and I
298:46 - don't need to change it but actually I
298:48 - need to change it whenever the data is
298:50 - not initialized so let me just add this
298:52 - condition once again I think it should
298:54 - be inside this aspect
298:56 - ratio I think that is a great place to
298:59 - do so yeah that's right let me just add
299:01 - this condition to say the child of this
299:04 - preferred size widget should be an
299:07 - aspect ratio but that is only true
299:09 - whenever the data is initialized so I'm
299:11 - going to just say if the controller do
299:14 - uh value do is
299:18 - initialized it means that if the data is
299:20 - initialized only in this case I want to
299:23 - show this video and everything related
299:26 - to it but if it is not initialized I
299:29 - just want to
299:30 - show a simple padding widget and that is
299:34 - it and now it should be okay let me just
299:37 - do a h rest start and let's see if it is
299:39 - working properly like you want it to
299:53 - work okay right now we got this
299:56 - thumbnail when I click on the
299:58 - thumbnail we are now we get to the
300:01 - actual video and right now as you can
300:04 - see this is working properly I just need
300:06 - to add and increase the padding so let
300:08 - me just do that as well
300:10 - I just need to have a padding not from
300:12 - the top side but actually from the
300:14 - bottom side and it's going to be a
300:16 - padding of something like 90 maybe you
300:18 - can just do some trials and error you
300:20 - will you will understand how it should
300:23 - be and I can just make it something like
300:27 - 100 and right now it is okay and right
300:30 - now because the data is not initialized
300:32 - we are just seeing this uh loading but
300:36 - whenever the data is loaded and we got
300:38 - the actual video on that Guess The Video
300:40 - will be uh display so right now it is
300:44 - working well and there's no problem okay
300:47 - now I'm going to just upload two more
300:48 - videos to this platform because I want
300:50 - to just show you one more feature that
300:52 - is happening inside the video and let's
300:55 - just upload this new video I'm going to
300:56 - just click here upload a video and then
300:58 - I can upload this a very short video now
301:02 - I just need to enter a title and also
301:04 - description something like this
301:07 - is our second video
301:12 - and also uh and also the description is
301:15 - something like uh optional I can just
301:18 - leave it empty and it's not a big deal
301:20 - the next I'm going to just select the
301:21 - thumbnail and it's again and once again
301:24 - it's going to be just this thumbnail
301:25 - because I don't have any other image
301:26 - inside my emulator and of course it's
301:29 - not a big deal now I'm going to just
301:30 - publish this
301:32 - video and now this video should be just
301:34 - uploading and I can also check it inside
301:36 - my fire press console
301:40 - this is my database and I can just do I
301:42 - refresh this PCH to see if the video is
301:44 - uploaded or
301:48 - not and I believe the video should be
301:51 - just uploaded so let me just do a hard
301:52 - rest start to check it inside the
301:59 - emulator yeah as you can see the video
302:01 - is just uploaded this is our first video
302:04 - which says first video on the platform
302:05 - and also this one is the second video
302:08 - and the title is just this is our second
302:10 - video of course the thumbnails are the
302:12 - same let's wait for the thumbnail to be
302:14 - uploaded it may take a while because my
302:16 - internet connection is just weak right
302:18 - now but it should be just done and right
302:21 - now I have two videos uploaded by the
302:23 - same guy D Ahmed amini this is my
302:25 - account which I uploaded two videos
302:27 - using these two
302:29 - accounts and what I want to just show
302:31 - you is if I click inside the video uh
302:34 - right now you can see that I'm only
302:36 - seeing only one video but it's not the
302:39 - same inside the the actual YouTube clone
302:41 - because in the YouTube when you just
302:43 - open a video you can see other videos or
302:46 - the suggested videos just at the bottom
302:48 - right here so right now it is empty but
302:51 - it should not be like this and I should
302:52 - just upload some more videos right here
302:55 - so it can be any video but not the above
302:57 - video it's just uh and it is just like
303:00 - the actual YouTube that we have in our
303:03 - phone so right now what I want to do is
303:05 - to just uh using a stream Builder show
303:08 - the other videos at a bottom of this
303:10 - page so how can I do
303:14 - that I just want to come
303:16 - here and I believe that after the
303:19 - padding inside the list view I can just
303:22 - use an stream Builder to show the other
303:24 - videos right here so I'm going to just
303:27 - create an stream Builder and the stream
303:29 - is going to be just once again the
303:31 - inance of fire fire let me just create
303:33 - this and then I'm going to go inside the
303:36 - collection of videos and of course
303:38 - videos we have to take the Snapchats but
303:42 - using this stream we are getting
303:43 - actually all the videos but that is not
303:46 - what we actually want because we want to
303:49 - get all the videos but not the above
303:52 - video not this video and of course the
303:55 - reason is clear so how can I do it I can
303:57 - just do it
303:58 - using uh I just need to add a condition
304:01 - and I'm going to just do it using this
304:03 - word method and I'm going to just say
304:06 - that I need to take all the videos
304:09 - inside this CL collection but except one
304:12 - video and it is the video that the user
304:14 - ID is the same the user ID of the above
304:17 - video so I'm going to just say where
304:20 - user ID is not equal
304:24 - to the widget. video. user ID so I'm
304:30 - going to I'm going to just explain one
304:31 - more time what basically I say here is
304:34 - that I want to take all the videos
304:36 - inside this collection but not the video
304:39 - which the US user ID is equal to the
304:41 - user ID above I don't want to take that
304:44 - video and finally I just take all the
304:46 - snapshots of this
304:48 - video okay the next is inside the
304:50 - Builder and here once again I can make
304:52 - some conditions here to check if the
304:54 - data is loading or if we are not getting
304:57 - the data first of all I'm going to just
304:59 - say if
305:00 - snapshot.
305:02 - data I mean snapshot. has. has data is
305:05 - not equal to true it means that we don't
305:07 - have any data or maybe
305:12 - snapshot. data is equal to null so I'm
305:16 - going to just check that if we don't
305:17 - have any data I just want to return an
305:20 - error pitch so I'm going to just say
305:22 - error just return this error pitch this
305:24 - is the first condition the second
305:26 - condition is going to be the the time
305:29 - when the data is loading and I'm going
305:30 - to just say if the snapshot.
305:32 - connectionist said is equal
305:38 - to okay connectionist waiting it means
305:41 - that the data is not loaded yet in this
305:43 - case I want to just return the
305:46 - loader and finally when we have the data
305:49 - I just want to return post again
305:53 - actually I want to return a list V
305:55 - Builder here so I just need to show a
305:57 - list and in this case I'm going to just
305:59 - return a list without
306:01 - Builder and the item Builder is going to
306:04 - be just here I will return the post and
306:07 - of course it takes a video
306:10 - and I have to initialize that one as
306:12 - well and the video here is going to be
306:16 - just something like let me create it
306:18 - here actually right here I can say
306:22 - snapshot.
306:24 - data. docs here I'm going to just take
306:27 - all the docs it means this docs is all
306:29 - the videos so I can just call it
306:31 - something like videos
306:34 - map but here it wants me a video model
306:40 - okay so right now that I have this
306:41 - videos map I can just convert it into a
306:44 - something like a video model so I'm
306:47 - going to just use this map method and
306:49 - then I take each of this video and here
306:52 - I can just say video
306:55 - model actually like this video model I
306:58 - will use the from map method and here
307:00 - I'm going to just say video. data okay
307:04 - so I have to just return this the result
307:08 - of this uh from from m method and the
307:10 - result will be added to the something
307:12 - like videos and here I can just
307:16 - say videos and I will take each index
307:19 - inside here so let's see what's the
307:21 - problem
307:23 - here actually it should be a list right
307:26 - now yeah I have to convert this into a
307:28 - list I just forgot it now everything
307:30 - should be working so what I did here was
307:33 - uh first of all I took all the docs
307:35 - which is of course all the videos and
307:37 - then I stored it inside this videoos map
307:39 - map and then I just use the map method
307:42 - to just convert each of these videos
307:44 - into a video model and then convert
307:47 - everything into a list and inser it
307:49 - inside this videos list and finally I
307:51 - just returned it each index of these
307:54 - videos to this
307:56 - post so now everything should be working
307:59 - and let me just also put some Comas here
308:01 - to just format the code and everything
308:04 - should be all right now right now so let
308:05 - me just do a hot restart
308:14 - if I open the first video not only this
308:17 - video but I should also see the other
308:19 - videos at the bottom of this
308:21 - page but right now it's not doing that
308:24 - so let me just check if there's any
308:26 - problem
308:32 - here okay actually I got the error that
308:36 - why we are just getting this the reason
308:38 - is just I made a mistake right here uh
308:42 - in the condition right here I said that
308:43 - if the user ID is not equal to the user
308:46 - ID of this guy so it's completely wrong
308:49 - because I should not say this
308:51 - because uh in this case you are saying
308:53 - that if the videos are uploaded by the
308:57 - same guy it should not be uh displayed
309:00 - here but that's wrong I should not use
309:02 - the user ID but I should use the video
309:04 - ID and here I'm going to just also say
309:07 - video ID
309:09 - and right now it should be working
309:11 - perfectly yeah as you can see it's
309:13 - working right now and that was the only
309:16 - problem that I used the user ID in a
309:18 - setad of a video ID so just make sure to
309:20 - make it right and right now I can see
309:22 - the other videos this is my the actual
309:24 - video and then at the bottom I can see
309:26 - the other videos as
309:28 - well so let me just upload another
309:31 - video okay if I want to just upload
309:34 - another video here this is going to be
309:37 - 10 seconds video long
309:41 - enter a title I'm going to just say our
309:44 - third
309:46 - video and the description I can just
309:48 - leave it empty because it's optional and
309:50 - then I have to select the
309:51 - thumbnail and I'm going to just select
309:53 - this one and finally I can just publish
309:56 - the
310:00 - video let me also do a refresh to this
310:02 - Firebase console to see if the video is
310:04 - uploaded or not and we can just check it
310:07 - inside this console
310:10 - okay now the video is uploaded and this
310:12 - should be it this is the second video
310:17 - and maybe this one is the third video
310:18 - that I just uploaded yeah that's right
310:20 - this is our third video and if I do a
310:22 - hard Restort
310:24 - here I should be able to see the
310:30 - video okay right now as you can see we
310:33 - got three videos this is our third video
310:35 - our first video and also the second
310:38 - video and when I open a video for
310:40 - example let me just open the first video
310:42 - on the platform as you can see I can
310:44 - also see the other videos our third
310:46 - video and also the second video I can
310:49 - see both and they're just displaying at
310:51 - the bottom of the actual video that we
310:53 - are just playing so it is exactly how it
310:55 - is inside the actual YouTube so I we
310:58 - also got this
311:00 - feature and this is the first video in
311:02 - the platform this is the third video and
311:04 - also this one is the second video and I
311:06 - can just scroll through this page now
311:09 - that I have this Behavior I also want to
311:12 - add the comment feature to this platform
311:14 - so at the bottom of this video right
311:16 - here I need to display a comment box and
311:20 - then when the user clicks on it they
311:22 - should be you know it should be open a
311:24 - modal bottom sheet and then inside that
311:27 - users should be able to uh post their
311:30 - comment and also their they can see
311:33 - their first comment and also inside the
311:34 - bottom sheet they will be able to see
311:36 - all the comments inside a specific post
311:39 - and
311:40 - video okay let's start on the comment
311:45 - section okay right now that we are done
311:47 - with the video we can just go and start
311:49 - creating the commment feature and it's
311:51 - going to be the next feature that I will
311:52 - create to this project so the first
311:55 - thing I need to upload a comment and
311:57 - then I can show it and display it into
311:58 - the UI so first of all inside this
312:01 - upload folder I can add a new folder and
312:03 - I'm going to just call it
312:06 - comments and Okay so it should not be a
312:09 - file let me just remove this I'm going
312:12 - to add a folder to this upload folder to
312:15 - say it should be called comments and I
312:17 - will put just everything related to the
312:19 - comments inside this
312:21 - folder and the first thing I need to
312:23 - create a model for this comment as we
312:25 - had for the video and also we had for
312:27 - the user I need a model for the comment
312:29 - as well and I'm going to just call it
312:31 - comment
312:32 - model okay so let's create this comment
312:36 - model which I'm going to just call it
312:38 - comment
312:40 - model and this model is going to have
312:42 - five fils one is going to be for the
312:44 - video ID the comment text and uh let me
312:48 - just create them one by one so the first
312:50 - one is going to be the common text and
312:52 - we want to know which comment has the
312:54 - user just posted the next one is going
312:56 - to be the video ID of course it's all
312:58 - it's again an
313:00 - string uh why I'm just creating a video
313:03 - ID field it's because we want to know
313:05 - the comments are belong to which video
313:08 - and for doing it I need to have this
313:09 - video ID here as well and the next one
313:12 - we also need a comment ID just we had in
313:15 - the video ID and also we had in the user
313:17 - ID we again need an ID for the comment
313:20 - as well so it's going to be comment
313:22 - ID and the next I just want to show that
313:25 - display name and also the perpose
313:26 - picture so I'll also add this one as
313:28 - well display name and also the next one
313:31 - is going to
313:34 - be profile picture so I have this five
313:38 - fil inside this model and let me just
313:41 - generate Constructor for it and that's
313:44 - it I also need to just generate Json
313:47 - calization and I don't need this two so
313:50 - let me just remove them and also remove
313:53 - this unnecessary import so inside this
313:56 - model I have a comment text a video ID a
313:58 - comment ID display name and the profile
314:00 - picture and now I can just go and
314:03 - actually upload this
314:06 - comment so let me just create a
314:09 - repository and I'm going to just call it
314:11 - comment
314:14 - repository and here I have this class
314:17 - again comment
314:22 - repository let me just create an
314:24 - inocence of Firebase uh o and also
314:26 - Firebase firer because we are going to
314:28 - need it inside this repository and I
314:31 - will have
314:33 - final Firebase fir store which I'm going
314:36 - to just call it fir store
314:40 - and the next I also want to add or maybe
314:42 - we don't need a fire so maybe it's okay
314:45 - let me just generate a Constructor and
314:47 - now we have this fire
314:49 - Ser now the first method that I need to
314:52 - create here is going to be a method to
314:53 - just upload everything inside the
314:56 - Firebase F store so I need to create a
314:58 - method called uh upload
315:01 - comment to firer and using this method I
315:05 - can just upload this comment inside the
315:07 - firer and of course it going to be just
315:09 - a synchron this and now I can use a wait
315:13 - to say okay I will go inside the fire
315:15 - store and I will just create a new
315:17 - collection called comments it's going to
315:19 - be the third collection that we have
315:21 - inside this
315:22 - project then I need to have a doc and
315:25 - this Doc is going to be a comment ID so
315:28 - as I said I need a comment ID here and
315:30 - then I'm going to just set everything
315:33 - inside this collection and before that
315:37 - actually I need to create a Comm an
315:39 - inance of commment model here so let me
315:41 - just create it it's uh going to be the
315:44 - type comment model I will just call it
315:47 - comment and it's equal to comment model
315:51 - and here I'm going to just use the two
315:53 - map because I want to add uh first of
315:55 - all let me just create an inance of this
315:57 - and then I will need to use that to
315:59 - Method so here I have an inance of
316:01 - comment the comment model and I have to
316:04 - initialize this values the comment text
316:06 - video ID comment ID display name and
316:08 - perect picture and I'm going to just
316:09 - fill all of them using
316:12 - parameters
316:15 - okay let me just put a comment here to
316:17 - re format the code here and then I can
316:20 - just have some parameters here and using
316:22 - this parameters I will just initialize
316:24 - the
316:25 - values and all of them are going to be
316:27 - just required the first one is uh the
316:30 - for commment
316:35 - text the next one is going to be for the
316:38 - video ID
316:40 - the next one is going to be comment ID
316:45 - or actually I can generate the comment
316:46 - ID here and I don't need to uh pass it
316:50 - as a parameter I can just do it right
316:52 - here and the next one is going to be
316:54 - just uh the profile picture and also
316:56 - display name so let me just create this
316:59 - one as well this is for the display name
317:01 - and also the last one is going to be for
317:03 - the profile
317:05 - pick okay right now I have all of them
317:08 - now let me just generate a common ID
317:10 - here as well and as you know I need to
317:12 - import The UU ID package and using this
317:14 - package I can just generate any random
317:17 - number or everything I want so let me
317:19 - just create one here right here before
317:22 - the inance of comment model I can just
317:25 - uh have any string I'm going to just
317:27 - call it comment ID and it's going to be
317:31 - equal to this uu ID and then I can just
317:34 - use
317:36 - the V4 and to just generate a random uh
317:41 - string for me and I can just use this
317:43 - comment ID right
317:46 - here okay so right now that I have
317:49 - everything done here when I want to set
317:51 - the data actually I can use this in
317:53 - sense of common model this one and then
317:56 - I can use the two map method to just
317:58 - send everything inside the firester
318:00 - database and and of course it should be
318:02 - just familiar with this because we
318:03 - already did that with the user and also
318:05 - we did that for the video okay so using
318:09 - this I will just send everything to the
318:10 - farest database and now I need to create
318:14 - the UI of the command page so now I need
318:17 - to create the UI of the comment page
318:19 - because I should be able to use this
318:21 - method right there but before that let
318:22 - me just create a provider for this
318:24 - comment
318:25 - repository it's going to be called
318:27 - comment
318:29 - provider and it's equal to a simple
318:32 - provider and I'm going to just return
318:34 - the comment
318:35 - repository the fire store is going to be
318:37 - just fire store fire firester do inance
318:41 - let me just create an inance of this and
318:44 - right now everything should be done all
318:47 - right so now let me just create this
318:49 - commment page UI and actually this
318:51 - commment is not going to be a page
318:54 - actually it's going to be just a model
318:55 - bottom sheet and of course you should be
318:57 - familiar with that I'm not going to
318:59 - create a page but I'm going to just
319:01 - create a model bottom
319:03 - sheet first of all let me just open this
319:05 - video and as you can see inside the
319:07 - project whenever I I open a video uh
319:10 - right here be before I display the other
319:13 - videos exactly right here I want to have
319:16 - a box and when the user clicks on the
319:18 - box they will be able to open this model
319:21 - bottom sheet and the comment sheet and
319:23 - then also they will be able to see the
319:25 - first comment right here inside this box
319:27 - it's exactly like the actual YouTube so
319:30 - they are able to see the first comment
319:31 - or sometimes the most popular comment
319:34 - right inside XEX
319:36 - boox okay so let me just create that
319:41 - uh I believe that after this
319:46 - row yeah so after this row I should be
319:50 - able to create this box let me just see
319:53 - if it's okay so this one is the row and
319:56 - then I have single Char scroll view or
319:57 - maybe I should do it outside this
319:59 - padding yeah I believe this is a good
320:01 - place here I'm going to just write a
320:02 - comment to say comment box I'm going to
320:05 - just create it
320:07 - here and it's going to be basically just
320:09 - a container it's not uh something hard
320:12 - I'm going to just create a simple
320:13 - container I just need to give it a color
320:15 - of
320:17 - gray and I also need to give it a height
320:20 - and also a weight the height is going to
320:22 - be something like 45 and also the we is
320:25 - going to be something like
320:29 - 200 yeah this is the box which I need
320:32 - and of course I will change the color
320:34 - and also I'm going to just give it a
320:35 - padding and also I need to add a border
320:37 - radius inside it
320:39 - first of all let me add a
320:44 - decoration and here I have a b radius
320:47 - and I will just give it a b radius of
320:48 - something like maybe 14 it's a b radius
320:52 - from the old sides and it's going to be
320:53 - a circular of for in and that should be
320:57 - all
320:59 - right and of course I need to put this
321:02 - comment inside this decoration because
321:05 - otherwise it will give us
321:06 - error okay I have this actually this 14
321:10 - is a lot let me just put it something
321:11 - like eight and right now it should be
321:14 - okay I also need to add a padding I mean
321:16 - I need to wrap uh this container with a
321:18 - padding because I want it to have some
321:21 - distance from the left side the right
321:22 - side and also from the top and bottom
321:24 - bottom side okay let me just have a
321:28 - padding
321:30 - here and it's going to be a padding of
321:32 - symmetric and then horizontally it will
321:34 - be in eight and also vertically I will
321:36 - have a padding of 12
321:39 - and it looks like this I believe it's
321:42 - beautiful and I just need to change the
321:45 - color of this uh container because this
321:48 - deep gray color is not looking very nice
321:50 - and I will just give it some shade of
321:52 - something like maybe 200 let me just
321:57 - see or maybe a shed of 300 it should
322:00 - look
322:01 - perfect yeah right now it looks more
322:03 - like the actual U and when the user
322:06 - click on this container this should
322:08 - should be just uh able to open that
322:10 - model bottom sheet. comment sheet so I
322:13 - will just wrap this container with a
322:15 - gesture
322:18 - detector and in the onta property when
322:21 - the user clicks on this container I want
322:24 - them to be able to open a comment sheet
322:27 - okay so when the user clicks on this
322:29 - container I just want to show a model
322:31 - bottom sheet and the context is context
322:33 - and the Builder I will just return a
322:36 - comment sheet
322:37 - here and of course I need to create this
322:40 - common sheet right
322:42 - now okay so let me just create uh
322:45 - actually this common
322:46 - sheet and right now let's just scroll up
322:50 - let me find this content and right here
322:53 - I need to add a new folder because as
322:55 - you already know I have different
322:57 - folders for the content and also for the
322:59 - upload I have three folders inside the
323:02 - upload one is for the comment for the
323:03 - long video and for the short video and
323:05 - exactly I have these three folders
323:07 - inside the context because inside the
323:09 - content folder because I want to just
323:11 - display all the contents right here so
323:14 - here I'm going to just add the new
323:15 - feature I mean the new content which is
323:18 - going to be the forur the comment and in
323:20 - the next tutorial I will also add the
323:22 - short video but for now let's work on
323:25 - the comment and here I will just add a
323:27 - file called comment sheet so now let's
323:31 - create the UI of this comment sheet and
323:33 - it's going to be really easy it's not
323:35 - that hard and let me just create an set
323:38 - this and I will just call it comment
323:40 -  back to the video I need to import
323:43 - this and error should be gone now here
323:46 - I'm going to just return a container
323:48 - because it's as I said before it's not a
323:50 - page actually it's just a simple
323:51 - container and inside this container and
323:55 - inside this comment sheet I just want to
323:57 - have uh first of all I will just write
323:59 - and add some text like comments and also
324:02 - I will add a text to say remember to
324:04 - keep comments respectful on this stuff
324:07 - and at the bottom of this comment sh I
324:09 - just want to have uh a text field which
324:12 - inside that user will be able to
324:14 - actually add its comment so we'll have a
324:16 - profile picture of course the profile
324:18 - picture of the current user and then we
324:20 - will have a text build and also a button
324:22 - which all user to actually upload the
324:24 - comment to the fire
324:26 - database so let's create that it's going
324:28 - to be really
324:30 - easy inside this container the child is
324:33 - going to be just a
324:35 - column and inside the children first of
324:37 - all I will have a
324:38 - row and inside this Row first of all I
324:41 - can have a text to just say
324:44 - comments and I will also change the
324:46 - style that style is going to be have a
324:48 - font size of 20 and also I will give it
324:52 - a front way of
324:56 - both so now I also need to add a button
324:59 - to this row and it's going to be just a
325:01 - close button which when you when the
325:03 - user clicks on this button they will be
325:05 - just navigated uh to the previous page
325:08 - so outside of this text I can just add
325:10 - an icon
325:12 - button and the onpress is going to be
325:14 - just empty for now and inside the icons
325:17 - I can just add an icon of
325:21 - close and let me just reformat the and
325:24 - now it should be okay and let me just
325:27 - show it inside the emulator that how
325:28 - this page is actually working when the
325:31 - user clicks on this container they will
325:33 - be able to see this uh container so this
325:36 - is actually the common sheet and
325:39 - actually the size is okay and right now
325:41 - this is going to be the comments and
325:43 - this is the button and let me just
325:45 - change the M xelement of this
325:47 - row and it's going to be just a main AIS
325:49 - element do space between and now it
325:52 - should be
325:54 - okay and I will also actually add some
325:56 - padding to this row let me just wrap it
325:58 - with a padding
326:04 - widget and we will have a padding of
326:07 - actually symmetry
326:08 - horizontally equal to 8 and also
326:10 - vertically equal to 12 and it should be
326:12 - good I
326:14 - believe and it's great the next I also
326:17 - want to add a text here to say remember
326:19 - to keep comments respectful and also
326:21 - follow our community and guid list it's
326:23 - the same like we have in actual YouTube
326:25 - and outside this row I can just added
326:27 - this text and it's going to be just
326:29 - remember to keep comments respectful and
326:34 - to follow our community and guideline so
326:38 - it's exactly like we have in the actual
326:40 - YouTube and let me just uh copy and
326:44 - paste it outside this padding it's the
326:45 - correct
326:47 - place and as you can see it's like this
326:50 - and I also need to actually add it
326:52 - inside a container so let me just take
326:55 - this and then I will create a container
326:57 - here and the childart of this container
327:00 - is going to be this
327:03 - text
327:05 - okay now I need to change actually the
327:07 - decoration of this
327:11 - container and I will just give it a
327:13 - color of
327:15 - gray with a shade of like
327:18 - 400 it's like this and it should be good
327:23 - actually and I also need to change the
327:25 - padding of this container and I will
327:27 - just give it a a padding from the all
327:29 - sides and it's going to be a value of
327:35 - six okay so right now it looks nice let
327:38 - me also just uh maybe it's correct and
327:43 - if I want to add some more installing to
327:45 - this container I will do it later on but
327:47 - for now it's going to be okay and at the
327:49 - bottom of this container I mean at the
327:51 - bottom of this column I just want to add
327:54 - a
327:55 - row and inside this row actually I can
327:58 - just create first of all a circle aor to
328:01 - show the dis the profile picture of the
328:03 - current user who is just uploading this
328:05 - comment and then I can have a text fi
328:07 - and at the end I can have a button to
328:09 - let user to actually upload that
328:12 - comment so first of all let me just
328:14 - create this circle
328:16 - aor and it will have a radius of
328:18 - something like
328:20 - 15 the next I want to give it a
328:23 - background
328:25 - color and the background color is of
328:27 - course gray and I will later on add a
328:30 - background image and it's going to be
328:31 - the purple picture of the current user
328:33 - but for now I'm going to just leave it
328:34 - empty like this and I can just increase
328:37 - this radius of this circle something
328:40 - like 18 and right now it should be
328:42 - better and I will just put all of them
328:45 - at the bottom of the pitch so I can just
328:47 - have an spacer here because I want this
328:50 - row to be at the bottom of this
328:51 - container not like here and it should be
328:54 - good and let me just wrap it with a
329:01 - padding and here I will have a a padding
329:04 - from the bottom side like a padding of
329:06 - 10 and also I want to have a padding
329:08 - from the right side it and also from the
329:10 - left side it so now it should be
329:19 - okay and it looks okay the next after
329:22 - the circle ofor I want to add a text
329:25 - field and this text field also has a
329:28 - decoration because I want to change the
329:30 - styling of this text field and of course
329:33 - it's a type of input
329:36 - decoration and here here first of all I
329:38 - will just change the border of this text
329:41 - field and here I need to add a class of
329:44 - input
329:45 - border actually outline input border and
329:49 - inside this class I have this Border
329:52 - Side which here I can just add a border
329:55 - side and then here I can just change the
329:57 - color so I will just give it a color of
329:59 - like gray it's
330:02 - okay now I also want to add a hand text
330:06 - so the hand text is going to be just
330:07 - something like
330:08 - add a
330:11 - comment and it will just let the user to
330:13 - know what's this text about and also uh
330:16 - and I also can just wrap this text f
330:19 - with a size box because uh I just wanted
330:21 - to have an a specific size and I will
330:23 - just give it a height of 45 and also a
330:26 - weight of 140 let's see let's see how it
330:30 - does it look like and it looks like this
330:32 - it's okay let me just increase the WID
330:34 - of this text field to something like 250
330:38 - and I also can increas it to something
330:40 - like 265 actually not 165
330:46 - 265 and right now it should be okay and
330:49 - at the end I also want to add an icon
330:52 - button here to be able to send this
330:54 - comment okay right now it looks good and
330:58 - I can also just add a size box between
331:00 - this circle and the text field and it's
331:03 - going to be just right
331:06 - here and it just has a WID of 10 pixel
331:11 - and that should be all right and now let
331:13 - me just create this uh icon button at
331:16 - the bottom of uh at the end of this row
331:19 - and it's going to be just outside of
331:20 - this size box and here I can just have
331:22 - an icon
331:23 - button and the unpress is going to be
331:25 - just empty for now because I will later
331:28 - add the functionality to it but the icon
331:30 - is going to be just an icons of send and
331:33 - I believe it's a g icon let me also
331:36 - remove this Con from this padding and
331:40 - add the padding right here right here
331:43 - there there and also here so now I have
331:48 - this icon at the end and let me just
331:50 - change the size and also the color of
331:52 - this icon I will give it a color of
331:55 - green and also change the size to
331:59 - something like 28 let's see how does it
332:02 - look
332:03 - like uh let me just increase it to
332:05 - something like 35
332:08 - yeah and I believe it should be great
332:10 - and actually I can also increase this uh
332:13 - the WID of this text bu to something
332:14 - like 280 or maybe
332:20 - 275 yeah so I believe this is really
332:23 - nice and now that we have the
332:25 - functionality here it should be great
332:29 - now let me also create a common tile
332:31 - whenever the user adds a comment so we
332:33 - need to have this comment tile that when
332:35 - the user clicks on this icon button they
332:37 - should be able to add the comment but we
332:40 - don't have actually the comment TI let
332:42 - me also create that right
332:44 - now and inside this comment actually
332:46 - inside the content I can have uh or I
332:49 - don't need any folder I'm going to just
332:51 - add it right inside the content so here
332:54 - inside the comments I'm going to just
332:56 - create a new file called comment
333:03 - TI and just like always let me just UT
333:07 - the material Dart and create the status
333:10 - widget I'm going to just call it common
333:12 - tile and here I'm going to just return
333:17 - container okay so let's see how this
333:20 - comment TI is going to look like it's a
333:23 - really simple think I just need to add a
333:25 - row to just uh create a circle Avatar a
333:27 - display name a dead publish and also the
333:30 - comment T so it's going to be really
333:31 - easy first of all the CH of this
333:34 - container is going to be just a column
333:36 - inside this column first of all I can
333:38 - have a row because I want to display a
333:41 - circle Avatar and the other stuff so let
333:45 - me first of all create the circle
333:47 - AAR it's going to have a radius of
333:50 - something like 15 and also a background
333:53 - color of
333:55 - gray the next after the circle aor I can
333:58 - actually create the display name which
333:59 - is going to be for now only a hard coded
334:02 - of Ahmed amini later on I can just give
334:04 - it the actual value of displ name let me
334:07 - we also change the style of this display
334:10 - name to something like this and I will
334:13 - give it a front sze of Ed and also I
334:16 - will change the Funway of
334:18 - this to something like Funway
334:23 - w500 that should be all right and the
334:26 - next after this I also want to add the
334:29 - de published of this comment so we
334:31 - should know that when this comment was
334:32 - published and again it's going to be a
334:34 - text to just say like a moment ago
334:41 - and right now after the row inside the
334:43 - column I want to just show the actual
334:45 - comment text that the user just posted
334:48 - and it's going to be once again inside
334:49 - the text to just say like uh first
334:52 - comment on the
334:57 - platform and I also want to add an icon
335:00 - at the end of this row so let me just
335:02 - create that one as well actually after
335:05 - this did publish of this comment I also
335:07 - want to have
335:08 - and icon because we have this in actual
335:12 - YouTube and I also want to have this and
335:15 - the icon is just called more width okay
335:18 - this is the name of the icon and I want
335:20 - to have it at the end of this row and
335:22 - also I would add an spor
335:24 - here okay that's going to be great and
335:28 - now I can just add my first comment so
335:32 - let me just open this commment sheet and
335:35 - at the bottom whenever the user clicks
335:37 - on on this send icon it's actually right
335:40 - this one when the user clicks on it I
335:42 - want to upload the comment to the fire
335:44 - store and here I can do it and first of
335:48 - all I need to change this stus fidget
335:50 - into consumer fidget because you want to
335:52 - read the the we want to just use the
335:55 - flod just like always to actually read
335:59 - the different
336:01 - providers here I'm going to just add
336:03 - this fidget RI and now I'm able to use
336:05 - this riff here
336:08 - and I will just say rev. watch and the
336:11 - provider that I'm going to use here is
336:13 - just the comment
336:14 - provider and now I can just use this
336:17 - upload comment to the fire Restort and
336:20 - as you can see I have some parameters to
336:22 - just initialize and it's going to be a
336:24 - comment text video ID display name
336:27 - profile picture and everything and let
336:29 - me just have all of them and actually I
336:33 - need three different sources to get each
336:35 - of this uh par first of all is a common
336:38 - text and of course it's going to be just
336:40 - the easiest one I just need to have a
336:42 - controller to this text field and for
336:45 - doing it I need to change this consumer
336:47 - widget into a consumer stateful widget
336:50 - so first of all let me just convert it
336:52 - back to the stess
336:53 - widget then I'm going to just change it
336:56 - let me just remove this widget dri as
336:58 - well now I have to change this estet
337:02 - into an stateful vget and now I'm going
337:04 - to change this stateful wiget into a
337:06 - consumer state full
337:08 - widget and I have to add consumer right
337:12 - here and also here right now it should
337:15 - be great let's also put some cons here
337:17 - to remove this blue warnings which makes
337:19 - our computer slow
337:22 - down and it's great now uh to initialize
337:26 - this comment Tex I just need to add a
337:28 - controller to it and right here I can
337:31 - just create
337:33 - that so it's going to be just once again
337:35 - to type text editing controller
337:38 - and I will just call it comment comment
337:43 - controller so I just created an instance
337:46 - of this text editing controller and now
337:48 - I can use this controller inside this
337:51 - text field right uh
337:55 - here and let me also remove this const
337:58 - and right now it should be okay so now I
338:01 - can just use this comments controller to
338:03 - initialize this comment TT so I'm going
338:04 - to just say comment controller. text and
338:06 - it's going to be the actual value of
338:09 - this
338:10 - comment the next I need to have the
338:12 - video ID and I can just have it using uh
338:16 - parameters uh and I need to create a new
338:20 - parameter here I'm going to just call it
338:22 - a video model and I need to initialize
338:25 - it and get the value from the previous
338:27 - page so let me just create this one and
338:30 - also generate
338:35 - Constructor now inside the video I need
338:37 - need to initialize this and the video
338:40 - here it should
338:41 - be vet. video and that's all
338:45 - right now back to the comment
338:48 - sheet I have this video and right here
338:51 - the video ID is going to be just
338:53 - something like vet. video. video ID and
338:59 - the final thing is the display name and
339:01 - also the profile picture I need this one
339:03 - as well and as you know this display
339:07 - name
339:08 - and profile picture should be the
339:09 - display name and the profile picture of
339:11 - the uh actually the current user because
339:16 - uh who is just sending and uploading
339:18 - this comment it's the guy who just
339:20 - uploaded this comment so uh this display
339:23 - name and the profile picture is exactly
339:25 - the data of the current user because
339:27 - only the current user is uploading the
339:30 - comment and for doing it I need to use
339:34 - another uh you know
339:37 - uh I need to use another provider here
339:40 - so let me just use this
339:42 - riat and here I need to have the current
339:45 - user data
339:48 - provider and I will just say when data
339:51 - when we actually get the
339:53 - data and this data is going to be just
339:55 - the
339:57 - user I want to take this user and
340:01 - actually I want to return that so let me
340:04 - just return this user and that should be
340:07 - all right and I will just store it
340:08 - inside a variable called
340:11 - user so now I can just use this user to
340:14 - initialize the value of display name and
340:16 - also the profile picture I will say
340:18 - user. value. display name and also I
340:23 - will do the same for the profile picture
340:25 - I have a user do value and
340:27 - [Music]
340:28 - also do profile picture okay that should
340:33 - be all right and everything should be
340:36 - good right now
340:38 - so right now I have this
340:41 - upload comment to the forer and of
340:43 - course it's going to be a future of void
340:46 - this method is a feature of void because
340:48 - it should be like
340:50 - this and then inside the commment sheet
340:52 - I need to make this method a wait and
340:55 - also asness this method so now
340:58 - everything should be good and let's test
340:59 - it out and let's see if it's working or
341:03 - not okay so now let's test it out if I
341:07 - add a new comment and I'm going to just
341:08 - say first
341:11 - comment and okay now if I just press on
341:16 - a send button let's see if the comment
341:18 - is added or
341:20 - not so now here it should be just added
341:23 - a new collection called comments and we
341:26 - should have the first comment called
341:28 - first comment let's check it
341:31 - out yeah as you can see we have this
341:34 - comments collection and this is the
341:36 - comment ID and this is all this stuff
341:38 - the comment TT is equal to first comment
341:41 - this is the comment ID as you can see we
341:43 - also have it here this is the display
341:44 - name of the user who uploaded this
341:46 - comment and also this is the profile
341:48 - picture and actually this is the video
341:50 - ID so everything is just working
341:52 - perfectly fine and right now I should
341:55 - also be able to display the comments
341:57 - because whenever we add a new comment we
342:00 - want it to display right here now I want
342:03 - to display this comments right after
342:05 - this text to say remember to comments
342:08 - respectful after that I want to just
342:11 - create an stream Builder and display all
342:13 - the comments so let's have this stream
342:16 - Builder and this stream is going to be
342:18 - just first of all let's create an
342:20 - instance of fireus fire store and then
342:22 - I'm going to just open the collection of
342:25 - comments and finally I can just take all
342:28 - the snapshots but remember uh like this
342:32 - I don't want to just take all the
342:33 - snapshots I want to have a condition
342:35 - here so I'm going to just use once again
342:37 - this word meod because I actually don't
342:40 - want to get all the comments but I want
342:43 - to have a condition to say I want to
342:45 - take all the comments but the video ID
342:49 - should be equal to the
342:52 - widget. video ID because as you know
342:55 - each video has its own comments and we
342:58 - just don't want to get all the comments
343:00 - in our database we just want to get each
343:03 - uh video's comments on that specific
343:06 - video I hope I'm clear because we want
343:09 - to get all the comments in a specific
343:11 - video so that's why I'm going to add
343:12 - this condition to say I want to take all
343:15 - the comments but the video ID should be
343:17 - the equal to video ID of this specific
343:21 - video and finally I take all the
343:24 - snapshots then we have a builder here
343:27 - and just like always I need to add some
343:29 - conditions here to say if the data is
343:32 - null or we don't have the data it's
343:33 - going to be the first condition to say
343:37 - if snapshot. data I mean if snapshot.
343:40 - has data is not true
343:43 - or
343:45 - snapshot do data is equal to null so you
343:50 - should know how does it work because I
343:51 - have done this before a lot of times and
343:54 - you should be just familiar with this
343:56 - which in this case I'm going to just
343:57 - return the error page because we don't
344:00 - have the actual data and there is some
344:02 - error the next I want to check if the
344:05 - data is loading so I'm going to just say
344:07 - if snapshot. connection is equal to
344:10 - connection set do
344:12 - waiting which in this case I want to
344:14 - just return the loader just like
344:18 - always and finally when we don't have
344:21 - each of these conditions the data is not
344:24 - having any data and it's not loading in
344:26 - this case it means that we have the
344:28 - actual data and here I just want to
344:30 - return a list with
344:34 - Builder and here we have this item
344:38 - Builder and also I want to have an item
344:41 - count and here I just want to display
344:44 - all the comments so how am I supposed to
344:47 - do so actually I can just say
344:53 - here we have snapshot. dat. dogs and
344:59 - then I can just store it inside a
345:02 - variable called comments map using this
345:05 - I just retrieve all the comments
345:07 - I want to convert this map into an
345:09 - actual comment model because we are
345:11 - working with models and not maps or this
345:13 - stuff so let me just converted into a
345:15 - map and first of all I need to use this
345:18 - map method to actually get each of these
345:21 - comments and I want to just return this
345:25 - comment and finally I will just uh
345:28 - convert it into a list and now it should
345:30 - be a list of commment models uh actually
345:33 - not like this I want to have a comment
345:37 - model yeah I want to have a commment
345:39 - model and use the from map method and
345:42 - the map is going to be just a commment
345:44 - do data I'm not going to explain this a
345:47 - lot because I have done this a lot so
345:49 - I'm going to just explain shortly I just
345:53 - get this comments map which is actually
345:55 - all the docs inside the collection of
345:57 - comments then I use the map method to
346:00 - just get actual each of the comments and
346:03 - then I use the from map to convert this
346:06 - map or everything into a commment model
346:09 - so I just converted to a commment model
346:11 - and finally uh I just turned it into a
346:15 - list so now I have a list uh of common
346:18 - models let me just specify the data type
346:21 - of this variable it's a list of comment
346:24 - model I'm going to just call it
346:27 - comments and the item count is going to
346:29 - be just comments.
346:35 - length and inside the item Builder I'm
346:38 - going to just return a comment
346:42 - tile and let me just open This commment
346:45 - Ti because we want to display all the
346:47 - information inside this comment tole and
346:50 - here I need to have a comment model as a
346:53 - parameter so let me just create that as
346:55 - well I have a comment uh uh model and
347:01 - I'm going to just call it comment and
347:03 - let me just generate a Constructor for
347:05 - it
347:07 - and here I have to initialize it and
347:09 - comment is going to be just equal to
347:12 - comments and each of these indexes so
347:14 - you should be just familiar how to use
347:16 - with list with. Builder it's not hard
347:19 - and now I'm going to just use the actual
347:22 - data of this comment to show the value
347:25 - first of all I need to initialize this
347:27 - background image and let me just create
347:29 - an cache Network image provider and the
347:32 - URL and the image of this cach network
347:34 - image provider is going to be just
347:35 - something like
347:37 - comment. purpose
347:39 - picture the next one is display name so
347:42 - it will have comment do display
347:45 - name and I also need to initialize the
347:48 - value for the de publish but I'm going
347:50 - to do it later on I'm going to I'm going
347:53 - to just wrap it with the cons and also
347:55 - this one and here I need to show the
347:59 - actual comment so I'm going to just say
348:03 - comment. comment
348:05 - text so now everything should be okay
348:08 - and let me just do a hot
348:13 - restart I open the first
348:17 - video and when I open this comment sheet
348:21 - as you can see I should be able to see
348:23 - the first
348:24 - comment but we are getting some error it
348:27 - means that there should be some problem
348:29 - here let's see if there is any
348:34 - problem okay so now I believe I I know
348:37 - what is the problem and again it's a
348:39 - very silly stupid mistake I just uh here
348:43 - inside a condition for this stream
348:44 - Builder I specified that where the video
348:47 - ID is equal to widget. video do I forgot
348:52 - to add a video ID here because we just
348:54 - want to compare if the video ID of this
348:57 - comment is equal to the video ID of this
349:00 - whole
349:01 - video and now everything should be good
349:04 - and as you can see this is our very
349:05 - first comment it was was a very silly
349:08 - mistake and this is programming and we
349:10 - can all sometimes make mistakes and we
349:12 - forgot some stuff and it start just a
349:15 - big deal and right now everything is
349:17 - great so we can see this is the first
349:20 - comment and actually it's not looking
349:22 - very nice so let me just change the
349:24 - styling of this comment and then
349:26 - everything should be
349:28 - great let me just open the comment
349:30 - tile and I also minimize the vs code
349:33 - that you can see the emulator properly
349:35 - as I'm just changing this comment
349:38 - tile and the first
349:41 - thing uh the first thing let me just
349:43 - remove this unnecessary
349:45 - container and the next I can just change
349:49 - this F size to something like 16 because
349:52 - it is really big and I also want to just
349:56 - increase the phone size of this a moment
349:59 - ago to this did published let me just
350:01 - add a text style to this one and first
350:03 - of all I will change the color to
350:05 - something like Gray or maybe blue gray
350:09 - okay now I also want to add a size box
350:12 - here and it's going to just have a BD of
350:15 - something like eight and it should be
350:18 - great now I can also just add a size box
350:21 - between this circle aor and this display
350:23 - name let me just add that one as well
350:26 - and here again we have a size box with a
350:28 - weight of eight and now let me also
350:32 - change this actual text and this comment
350:37 - and let me just find it this is going to
350:39 - be that common text and I will just wrap
350:41 - it with a padding and I just want to uh
350:45 - give it a padding from the right side
350:48 - but I'm not going to just give it a hard
350:51 - value because in that case it will be a
350:53 - lot it will just cause a lot of problems
350:55 - when we try down on different devices
350:57 - because of different dimensions that
350:59 - this stuff so let me just use media
351:02 - query here I'm going to just use media
351:04 - query
351:06 - do size of and then I can say where and
351:09 - then I'm going to just say give it a
351:11 - size of something like uh 07 0.7 size of
351:17 - this screen now it should be okay let me
351:20 - just remove this const from the whole
351:23 - page if there is any con let's see
351:25 - what's a problem here actually it's not
351:27 - a problem I just forgot to add this
351:30 - agenes so I'm going to just
351:32 - say padding is agenes do only and then
351:36 - from the right right side I can add this
351:39 - media query and actually this is a lot
351:42 - so I'm going to just use 0.6 and it
351:45 - should be great or maybe
351:51 - 58 okay right now it is great and it's
351:54 - working and I just also want to just
351:57 - wrap the whole column with a
352:00 - padding and I will just give it a
352:02 - padding from the top side and it's going
352:04 - to be a padding of seven because I
352:06 - wanted to have some distance from the
352:08 - top sides and while this one is not just
352:11 - changing let me just remove this padding
352:14 - from this column and instead
352:17 - maybe I should give this padding to this
352:20 - row let's see if it's
352:22 - working okay it should be great now I
352:26 - have this back and I will just want the
352:28 - the padding to be back on the column and
352:31 - I can just wrap the circle ofar with a
352:33 - padding as well and I will give it a
352:36 - padding of seven from the top side okay
352:39 - right now everything is cool and we have
352:40 - this comment feature done and it's great
352:44 - so let's work on the next
352:47 - feature so right now that we are done
352:49 - with the videos and comments and
352:50 - everything now I can just move on to the
352:52 - next section which is going to be the
352:53 - short video and now I have to upload the
352:56 - short video and then I will also display
352:58 - it inside the page and first of all I
353:00 - need to create a meter as you can see I
353:02 - already have this pe video I'm going to
353:04 - just copy it one more time and here I'm
353:06 - going to just change the name to Pig
353:09 - short video and here I'm not going to
353:11 - return the video Details page but
353:14 - instead I'm going to uh create a new
353:15 - page called page screen and I'm going to
353:18 - navigate to that new page so let me just
353:20 - come here to the short video feature as
353:22 - you can see I already have this widget
353:24 - folder inside the starting project as
353:26 - you can see inside which I have this my
353:29 - trim slider and it is a package and it
353:32 - is a vet that I have already created and
353:35 - I use it to let the user to triam the
353:37 - video as like they want so we can just
353:40 - go through this file and see how
353:41 - everything is written here I'm not going
353:43 - to go through it right now so right now
353:46 - I can create a new folder inside this
353:49 - short video and I'm going to just call
353:51 - it pages and create the first page here
353:54 - called sh video
353:58 - screen now I'm going to just input the
354:01 - material. dart and create an stad lless
354:04 - widget I can just call it V uh short
354:07 - video
354:08 - screen and just like always I can return
354:11 - an scaffold and then inside the body
354:15 - just like always a safe
354:17 - area then the sh is going to be a
354:21 - padding the padding is going to be just
354:23 - a padding from the top
354:25 - side and I'm going to just give it a
354:27 - padding of 20 just like always and then
354:29 - the child of this padding can be my
354:34 - column okay so right now I have this
354:38 - short video screen and I came back to
354:39 - this
354:41 - method and now in the peak short video
354:45 - method I'm going to just navigate to
354:46 - this short video screen so what actually
354:50 - I want to do is that whenever the user
354:53 - tap on this Method pictur video which
354:55 - I'm going to just call this method
354:56 - inside the upload section which I will
354:59 - show you uh whenever I call that meod I
355:02 - want to take a file I want to pick a
355:04 - video and then I want to just navigate
355:07 - to this short video screen so let me
355:10 - just open this upload bottom sheet as
355:13 - well and as you can see we already have
355:16 - this upload a video and whenever we tap
355:19 - on this button I pick a video but
355:21 - whenever the user picks a short video I
355:25 - want the other method which is called
355:27 - pick short video triggered so I'm going
355:29 - to just call this method and of course I
355:32 - will aoid
355:34 - this so that's all right let me also
355:37 - just run the emulator that I can show
355:38 - you right
355:43 - here okay so right now when I click
355:45 - right here I can upload a video and also
355:47 - create a shirt and when I click on a
355:49 - create a Shir I should be navigated to
355:51 - that page now I can pick a video when I
355:54 - click on this video I will be just
355:56 - navigated to this empty page because
355:57 - right now there's nothing inside this
355:59 - short video screen so now let me just
356:01 - work on the UI of this page and we are
356:04 - going to just create a lot of stuff here
356:06 - what I want to do inside this page is to
356:08 - create some functionality to let the
356:10 - user edit this short video and for doing
356:13 - it I need to use a flut package called
356:15 - video editor so let me just show this
356:16 - package to you really fast so this is a
356:19 - package it's the video editor version 30
356:22 - and the latest publish was eight months
356:23 - ago so you just need to install this
356:25 - package inside your P demo file which I
356:28 - already have done it as you can see I
356:30 - have this package right here and uh just
356:33 - make sure to install this package to be
356:34 - able to edit the video and I'm going to
356:37 - just UT this let me just remove the
356:39 - unnecessary Pages here and I'm going to
356:41 - just UT the video editor package because
356:44 - I need to use this package to actually
356:46 - edit the video so now I import this
356:49 - package and then I can use it to
356:51 - actually edit the video and first of all
356:53 - let me create the UI and uh just tell
356:56 - you that how this UI is going to be look
356:58 - like first I'm going to create one
357:00 - botton at the left side to just navigate
357:02 - back and at the right side I want to
357:04 - create a circle a just to display the
357:06 - you know length of the video then I want
357:09 - to display the actual video and the
357:11 - center and then at the bottom I can just
357:14 - have the trim slider from the of course
357:16 - the video editor package and finally I'm
357:18 - going to just have a button which uh
357:21 - it's going to be just let us to export
357:23 - the
357:24 - video first of all I need to change this
357:26 - stess vet into St vet and it allows me
357:29 - to create the initialization of this
357:32 - package so let me just uh go inside this
357:34 - package as you can see
357:36 - uh right now that we have installed this
357:38 - package and of course this is the demo
357:39 - of uh how it looks like uh all the
357:42 - features inside this package and to just
357:44 - initialize this package it's really
357:46 - simple let me just do it real quick I
357:48 - just need to I can just copy this code
357:50 - from the package from the I can just
357:51 - copy the code from the documentation
357:53 - then I'm going to just paste it right
357:55 - there as you can see I have created a
357:58 - controller for this video editor package
358:01 - and then I don't want it to be like this
358:03 - and actually I want to have the actual
358:06 - ual video here which I can just get it
358:08 - from the parameters so I'm going to just
358:09 - create this one as well and uh this
358:12 - video is going to be the type short
358:14 - video so now I have to create a model
358:16 - for the short video just like I did for
358:18 - the video for the user and for the
358:21 - comment I also need to create a model
358:23 - for this short video so let me just
358:25 - create that real quick I'm going to put
358:27 - it inside a new folder called model and
358:30 - the only file here is going to be the
358:32 - short video model so in this model model
358:36 - which I'm going to just call it I'm
358:38 - going to just call it short video model
358:40 - I will have four fills it's going to be
358:42 - the caption the user ID of the guy who
358:44 - is just uploading this short video uh
358:47 - and also I want to have uh the user ID
358:50 - the caption the DAT publish and also
358:53 - this is Stu so let me just create them
358:55 - one by one the first one is going to be
358:57 - just the
359:01 - caption the next one is going to be the
359:03 - user
359:04 - ID the next is going to be the actual
359:07 - short
359:09 - video and the final one is going to be
359:11 - the type dead time and it's of course
359:14 - did published just like we have the for
359:16 - the comment and also for the long video
359:19 - now let me just generate Constructor for
359:21 - this and also I'm going to generate Json
359:25 - calization now I will remove this
359:27 - unnecessary
359:28 - parts and I can also remove this one so
359:31 - now we can use this short video model to
359:34 - actually get this video so I'm going to
359:36 - just specify the type of this to short
359:39 - video
359:40 - model and of course I'm going to just
359:42 - call it short video now I can generate
359:46 - Constructor and this is it and of course
359:49 - the name is short video just like always
359:52 - uh this initial uh initializing this
359:55 - video editor package is really similar
359:57 - to initializing the video player package
360:00 - they're really similar and there are not
360:01 - a lot of difference between them and I
360:03 - can actually do it inside the edit set
360:05 - for first of all let me create this uh
360:09 - video editor controller and I'm going to
360:11 - just call it editor
360:14 - controller okay and now I can just
360:17 - create an ed method and of course you
360:20 - know how this method is working and I'm
360:22 - going to just paste everything right
360:24 - there and remove this part and also I'm
360:26 - going to call this controller editor
360:30 - controller okay that should be all right
360:32 - let's see what's the error of course I
360:34 - should not call this one
360:36 - uh final and this should be all right
360:40 - and let's see what's wrong
360:42 - here yeah because this short video
360:46 - should not be the type short video model
360:48 - yeah actually I don't need to use the
360:50 - actual model here I will use it later on
360:52 - I can just call it the type file because
360:55 - it is a type of file uh the video that
360:57 - we're getting from the image Pier
360:59 - package is of course it gives us a file
361:01 - back so I'm going to just call this a
361:03 - file or I can also make it a string and
361:06 - just uh send the path here but I'm also
361:08 - okay with this one so now everything is
361:11 - okay I have initialized this and of
361:13 - course as you can see I have a minan
361:15 - duration and also a Max duration here
361:18 - and you know the short videos in YouTube
361:20 - the maximum size is going to be 60
361:22 - seconds so I'm going to just change it
361:24 - to 60 and also the minimum duration here
361:26 - is going to be 3 seconds so it means
361:28 - that the users can upload any video with
361:30 - the minimum duration of 3 seconds and
361:32 - the maximum duration of 60 seconds
361:36 - okay now let me just check the package
361:38 - once again and I also have to do like
361:42 - this and it's going to just uh
361:44 - initialize the package completely for me
361:46 - so let me just copy this one actually I
361:48 - can just copy all this because I don't
361:50 - need to do it manually and I'm going to
361:52 - just pack it I'm going to past it right
361:54 - here and change the controller to editor
361:57 - controller okay now everything should be
361:59 - just all right and I will be able to use
362:01 - this package to edit the video and do a
362:04 - lot of stuff
362:06 - okay now inside the column that I have
362:09 - just initialized the package actually I
362:10 - can create the UI of this page and the
362:13 - background color of this scaffold is
362:16 - going to be black I want to have a dark
362:19 - theme here and then inside the column
362:22 - first of all I will create a row and
362:24 - then I will change the main access
362:25 - alignment to main access alignment do
362:27 - space
362:29 - between now that it's all right inside
362:31 - the children I will have one uh icon
362:34 - button
362:36 - and the icon for this is going to be
362:39 - just icons. Arrow back I just want to
362:44 - navigate back to the previous page
362:45 - whenever the user clicks on this arrow
362:47 - button and also I'm going to just create
362:50 - a circle Avatar and inside this circle
362:53 - AAR I just want to show the tri duration
362:55 - of the video because this is a video
362:57 - editor uh we are using video editor and
363:00 - I'm allowing user to edit this video and
363:02 - here I'm going to just show the trim
363:04 - duration
363:06 - and the radius for it is going to be
363:08 - just something like 18 and also I will
363:11 - give it a background color of something
363:13 - like blue G for now okay that should be
363:15 - all right let's see if it's working
363:18 - first of all let's see what's the error
363:20 - here I need to have a sh video which is
363:22 - going to be here right video now I
363:25 - should be able to see this let me just
363:26 - do a hot Resort
363:36 - now when I want to upload a short
363:38 - video I can choose this video and now I
363:41 - will be navigated to this page this is
363:43 - the uh icon button and also right here I
363:46 - can show the triam duration let me also
363:48 - change something here I want to just
363:51 - make this circular water is smaller and
363:53 - also actually I want to change this
363:55 - Arrow back icon as well so I can do that
363:58 - later on as well for now let me just
364:00 - wrap this row widget with a padding I
364:02 - want to have a padding from the both
364:04 - left and the right side
364:07 - and it's going to be a padding of right
364:09 - a padding of eight from the left and
364:10 - also from the right side that's all
364:13 - right now I have this one and actually
364:16 - inside the circle aatar I want to show
364:18 - the trim Direction but I'm going to do
364:19 - that later on for now it's going to be
364:21 - just empty the next I actually want to
364:24 - show the actual video here and to show
364:28 - the actual video I can just use a class
364:30 - from this video editor package so I'm
364:32 - going to just go outside of this r
364:36 - and then I can just use a class called
364:38 - crop grid viewer. preview and using this
364:41 - class I just need to initialize this
364:43 - video controller and I'll be able to
364:46 - show the actual video and as you can see
364:49 - this is going to be the actual video and
364:51 - of course I will have to change the
364:54 - aspect ratio of this uh video because
364:57 - short videos are actually uh doesn't
364:59 - have the aspect ratio of the long video
365:01 - so I will change that later on but for
365:03 - now okay we just have this uh video
365:06 - right here as well and also one other
365:09 - thing that I need to keep in mind is
365:11 - that I just want to display all of them
365:13 - whenever the data is initialized
365:15 - whenever this package is initialized so
365:17 - for doing it let me also do one more
365:19 - step
365:20 - here whenever I'm showing this column I
365:23 - just want to make sure that everything
365:24 - is initialized so for doing it I can
365:26 - just say editor controller do is
365:30 - initialized let's see if it if we have
365:33 - it or not here so yeah it's called
365:35 - initialize here so if this all the stuff
365:38 - are initialized in this case I only want
365:40 - to show this column but in other case I
365:43 - just want to display a simple size
365:47 - box and that's all right and just make
365:49 - sure that everything is okay and we will
365:51 - not get any error okay so now the next
365:55 - stuff after I have this is going to be
365:57 - just the trim slider and as you can see
366:00 - I already have this uh pre-built fidget
366:03 - this stream slender and you can just go
366:05 - through this files and see how
366:06 - everything is working so I have this
366:08 - pre-built fidget inside the starting
366:10 - project and then I can just uh create
366:13 - that trim slender after this video so
366:16 - I'm going to just uh uh use
366:19 - this trim
366:21 - slender and let me see what's it called
366:24 - and name of this class is just my trim
366:28 - slender so I can just import this and
366:32 - everything should be all right let's see
366:34 - what is I need to also uh initialize
366:37 - this controller which I'm going to just
366:38 - say editor controller and also the next
366:41 - parameter here is going to be a height
366:43 - I'm going to give it something like 45
366:45 - and it should be all right for now or
366:49 - maybe that's all right and as you can
366:51 - see I can just play with this dream
366:53 - slender okay let me just go once
366:57 - again I will upload this video and I
367:00 - will be navigated to this short video
367:02 - screen and actually I can play with this
367:04 - short video and everything but for now
367:08 - it's not actually really working but it
367:10 - will be solved and it's not a big deal
367:12 - so the next thing I just need to create
367:15 - at the button at the end of done so I'm
367:18 - going to just create a container here I
367:20 - have a child of a text button I just
367:23 - want to create a text button with an
367:25 - unpressed which for now is of course
367:27 - empty and then the child it's going to
367:30 - be a text to say done and I just want to
367:33 - export the video whenever I click on
367:35 - this
367:36 - button and I also want to change the you
367:39 - know styling of this container I want it
367:41 - to be uh first of all let me have a
367:44 - decoration and a box decoration here I'm
367:47 - going to just give it a color of white
367:50 - and I also want to change the Border
367:52 - radius for this and I'm going to just
367:53 - give it a big border radius from the old
367:56 - sides and it's going to have a border
367:58 - radius of 18 I hope that's
368:03 - perfect okay so so let's see how does it
368:06 - look like I have it right here and I
368:08 - also want it to be located at the right
368:11 - side of the page so what I can do is to
368:14 - just wrap this container with an align
368:16 - withget and then I will change the
368:19 - alignment to you know
368:23 - bottom right and it should just change
368:25 - its location and as you can see yeah
368:27 - right now it's located at the bottom so
368:29 - now first of all let me just change the
368:31 - aspect ratio of this video because I
368:33 - want it to be like a short video
368:36 - and I can just do it when I'm
368:38 - initializing this uh package right here
368:41 - when I say initialize this video editor
368:43 - I can change the aspect ratio and the
368:45 - perfect aspect ratio for this is going
368:47 - to be something like 3 2 3.5 and I have
368:51 - just get that uh aspect ratio by trial
368:54 - an error and I believe that this is the
368:56 - perfect aspect ratio for this video let
368:58 - me just do a hard Resort now when I go
369:01 - to the same page of create a short and
369:03 - then right here you should see that the
369:05 - aspect ratio is actually like this but
369:09 - it's not really looking very nice so let
369:11 - me just change
369:13 - it so I think that this aspect ratio is
369:16 - great and it's looking better this 4 to
369:18 - five this aspect ratio of 4 to 3.6 and
369:22 - it's actually looking like this and of
369:24 - course it's better than previous one you
369:27 - can actually change this uh numbers and
369:29 - you can just have your best aspect ratio
369:32 - now I also want to have a spor vet right
369:34 - here for this crop grid View and it will
369:39 - just make this dream sler go at the
369:41 - bottom and actually this is not what I
369:44 - want so I'm going to also have another
369:46 - spacer right
369:49 - here and let's see how does it look like
369:51 - right now and it looks just perfect and
369:53 - the way I want it to be at the top we
369:55 - have this arrow button and also the
369:57 - circle aor at the middle we have this
369:59 - video and at the bottom I have this
370:01 - stream sler and also this one and
370:04 - actually I also need to to uh give a
370:06 - padding to this uh bottom at the end so
370:10 - let me just wrap this container with a
370:11 - padding as
370:14 - well and I will just give it a padding
370:17 - of something like 12 from the bottom
370:18 - side and that should be good for now
370:21 - okay so right now we are done with the
370:23 - UI and let's work on the logic so I want
370:26 - to export the video whenever I click on
370:28 - this done button so I need to create a
370:30 - method called expert and I'm going to
370:32 - just create it right here and it's going
370:34 - to be called export
370:36 - video and of course it's going to be an
370:39 - as this method and I just want to
370:41 - trigger this method whenever I click on
370:43 - a button done right here so I'm going to
370:45 - just replace this with this right here
370:48 - so now let's work on the exporting video
370:52 - and it's going to be really simple and I
370:54 - can just use the package Video Editor to
370:56 - do so and we can use one of IT classes
370:58 - and of course some other classes of this
371:00 - video editor package to export the video
371:03 - and of course if you just to know uh
371:06 - there's also a separate package in
371:08 - flutter for just exporting video of
371:10 - course uh it can do a lot of other
371:12 - features it's a package called fmm Peg
371:15 - and that package is mainly focused on
371:17 - exporting video of course it can do a
371:19 - lot of other things as well so it has a
371:21 - lot of features but mainly that package
371:23 - is used to export video but for now
371:25 - because we have already used this video
371:27 - editor package we can also export our
371:29 - video using this package and we can use
371:31 - one of its classes to do so so let's
371:34 - just s exporting video and the first
371:37 - thing I want to do is to just create a
371:40 - configuration so I'm going to just use
371:42 - one of the classes from this package
371:44 - called video fmpg video editor config
371:48 - and just using this class I need to
371:50 - initialize the controller here which I'm
371:52 - going to just call video Ed I mean
371:55 - editor controller and I can just get a
371:57 - config so I'm going to just store it
371:59 - inside a variable called config now that
372:01 - I have access the config actually I can
372:03 - get a method called uh get execute uh
372:07 - config and now the result of this method
372:09 - is going to be just an execute so I'm
372:11 - going to just once again store it inside
372:13 - a variable called execute and now that I
372:17 - have done this finally I'll be able to
372:19 - get my command so I'm going to just
372:21 - write final string command and it's
372:25 - going to be equal to execute do command
372:30 - of course I have to make this method a
372:32 - wait because we don't know when it it's
372:34 - going to be done and now I can use the
372:36 - command and using this command I can
372:39 - actually export my video so I did all
372:41 - these steps just to take this command
372:43 - and now I have it now the actually
372:46 - process of exporting video will start
372:48 - from here which I will use a class
372:50 - called ffmpeg kit so I'm going to just
372:52 - use this method and of course if you can
372:54 - see here we just uh also exported this
372:58 - one because it's necessary uh right here
373:01 - I can use the execute async method so
373:04 - I'm going to just just use this method
373:06 - so now I have used the class of FMP EG
373:08 - kit that and then I have used this CL
373:11 - this method called execute asnc and this
373:13 - method would actually export the video
373:15 - for us and as you can see it has one
373:17 - required parameter which is the command
373:19 - which I just already created now this
373:22 - method also has some other parameters
373:25 - which I need to use and the second one
373:27 - is going to be just a method and of
373:29 - course it takes a session so I'm going
373:31 - to just write session right here because
373:33 - it takes that and right inside this
373:35 - method I can actually see if the
373:37 - exporting process is a success or it's a
373:39 - fail or whatever and I can also have
373:42 - some more parameters the next one is
373:43 - going to be just null because I didn't
373:45 - need it and the next parameter and the
373:47 - final parameter which I need here is
373:49 - going to be something that gives us a
373:52 - status so I can see whether uh what is
373:55 - the progress of exporting video I can
373:57 - actually and Visually see the progress
373:59 - of exporting video and the next one is
374:02 - just for this one so uh as I said this
374:05 - execute aing will export the video for
374:07 - me and it has one required parameters
374:09 - which is the command which I already
374:11 - generated and then in the second one it
374:14 - takes me it takes a session it means I
374:16 - have access to a session and using it I
374:18 - can actually see if the exporting
374:20 - process is a success if I can actually
374:23 - export the video and or not the next one
374:26 - I don't need and the final one is the
374:27 - status so I can actually see the
374:29 - progress of exporting a
374:31 - video so right now first of all let's
374:34 - actually see see if I can export the
374:36 - video or not and for doing it I can
374:39 - actually use decision to get a return
374:41 - code and I will store this return code
374:44 - inside a variable called code and of
374:47 - course it's going to be the type return
374:48 - code it is a data type generated uh
374:52 - created inside this package and of
374:54 - course I'm going to just call this code
374:56 - and make this a weight and also I will
374:59 - have like this to just say we will
375:01 - initialize this variable and also I need
375:03 - to make this method a sign
375:05 - so now I have a code and this return
375:07 - code will just tell us if the return
375:09 - code was a success or not and I can just
375:12 - uh make some conditions here to actually
375:14 - check that and I'm going to just say if
375:17 - the return code do is success and here I
375:21 - will just put the code if the return
375:24 - code. is Success it means that if the
375:26 - exporting process was success and we
375:28 - actually exported the video I'm going to
375:30 - just export the video right here so this
375:34 - is our first condition and the second
375:36 - condition is just else if the exporting
375:38 - process was not a success and we will
375:41 - not and we did uh and we were not able
375:43 - to export the video and here I'm going
375:45 - to just show some error to the
375:48 - user so we have these two conditions if
375:51 - you can export the video or we will just
375:52 - show some errors to the user and right
375:55 - now let me also create some variables
375:58 - here first I want to just accurate a
376:00 - variable for ex exporting it means if we
376:02 - are exporting right now and I want it to
376:05 - be a type of value Notifier and if you
376:07 - wonder why I didn't need to use this
376:09 - kind of value Notifier I'm using it
376:11 - because later on I want to display it
376:14 - inside the UI and I need to use some
376:16 - listables and for using listables I need
376:19 - this variables to be the type of value
376:21 - Notifier and it will just help me to you
376:24 - know uh display the values in real time
376:27 - to the UI and you will see that later on
376:30 - so this value is going to be just false
376:32 - for now and of course it's a type bullan
376:35 - I have an is exporting it's a type value
376:38 - identifier of bullan and initially it's
376:40 - equal to zero I mean initially it's
376:42 - equal to false and also I'm going to
376:44 - just have this once again one more
376:46 - variable and this time I want to have I
376:49 - want to show the exporting progress and
376:52 - again it's going to be just a value
376:54 - Notifier initially it will be equal to
376:58 - zero and the type of it the data type is
377:00 - going to be just
377:02 - double okay so right now now I have this
377:05 - two and let me just see how can I use it
377:08 - first of all the is
377:10 - exporting uh whenever I start the
377:12 - process of exporting video I want this
377:15 - is exporting to be equal to false so I'm
377:18 - going to just say as exporting do value
377:21 - should be equal
377:23 - to of course it should be true because
377:26 - it's initially yeah because initially it
377:28 - equal to false and when I start the
377:30 - process of exporting video I want the
377:32 - value of it to be equal to true
377:36 - and I need to use this value because of
377:37 - course it's a value Notifier and when
377:40 - the exporting process is done I want
377:42 - this is exporting that value to once
377:46 - again become equal to false okay and
377:50 - here in the status I also want to have a
377:53 - show the progress of exporting video so
377:56 - I'm going to just say exporting
377:59 - progress do value should be equal to
378:02 - here I just need to show the actual
378:04 - value of exporting video and I can just
378:07 - do it using a class uh from the config
378:09 - and here I'm going to just use get fmpg
378:12 - progress and here the time is going to
378:14 - be just uh this status I can use this
378:16 - status to uh get the actual time and I'm
378:19 - going to just say status do get time and
378:22 - also I want to convert it into an
378:23 - integer so like this I can just actually
378:26 - get the actual value of exporting
378:29 - progress so this should be good and one
378:33 - last step whenever I get some errors I'm
378:35 - going to just show some error to say
378:37 - show error snack bar and the message is
378:39 - going to be just something like failed
378:41 - uh video cannot be exported I will show
378:45 - just this
378:47 - error and whenever I can actually export
378:50 - the video I want to navigate it to and I
378:52 - want to navigate to a new page called
378:54 - video Details page and inside that page
378:56 - I can uh fill out the other fils for
378:59 - that short video for example because in
379:01 - this video because in this page we only
379:03 - export the video but in the the next
379:05 - page I also want to fill out the caption
379:07 - and also uh the de publish so other
379:09 - stuff so I need to also have another
379:11 - page for completing the sh video fields
379:14 - for ding that I'm going to just uh
379:15 - create a navigator so I'm going to just
379:17 - say navigator and here I need to create
379:20 - a new page to navigate so I'm going to
379:22 - just create that page as well inside the
379:25 - show video inside the pages I can create
379:28 - the second page called the short
379:33 - video details page and as I said inside
379:36 - this page I can actually fill out the
379:38 - other parameters and other fills inside
379:41 - let me just uh import the material Lo
379:43 - dot create an setet and I'm going to
379:45 - just call it short video detail
379:51 - pitch and now just like always I can
379:53 - return this safe area and then padding
379:56 - and here I'm going to just give it a
379:58 - padding from the top side and of course
379:59 - it's going to be just a padding of 20
380:02 - that's all right now let me just uh
380:04 - create this navigation and I will just
380:06 - say okay just navigate to this short
380:09 - video Details
380:11 - page that's all right and let me just
380:14 - put a cons here and that should be all
380:16 - right and now everything is okay let me
380:19 - also remove this error and what actually
380:22 - I have done here is let me just go to it
380:24 - once again I want to export the video
380:27 - and initially I have put the S exporting
380:30 - value equal to true because we have
380:32 - started a process of exporting video and
380:34 - then then I have created an
380:36 - configuration for this and then once I
380:38 - have this command I have used the actual
380:40 - meod of execute Asing which let me just
380:43 - export the video and this command is
380:45 - going to be just the first required
380:46 - parameter the next I have some other
380:48 - parameters as well and in the second one
380:50 - which is going to be a function I I can
380:52 - actually see if the exporting Pro
380:55 - process is a is a success or not and I
380:58 - can just do it using this code and I
381:01 - will say if the return code is success I
381:03 - can actually make this exporting equal
381:05 - to false and navigate to this short
381:07 - video Details page which inside this
381:09 - page I can actually fill out the other
381:11 - fields for the short video like the
381:12 - caption and other things and if it's not
381:14 - equal to success and if it failed to
381:18 - export the video I'm going to just show
381:19 - an error to say failed video cannot be
381:22 - exported and also here I can actually
381:24 - see the status of exporting video so
381:28 - that's going to be all right and
381:30 - everything should be good for now I will
381:32 - also specify the return type for this
381:34 - Expos video and it's going to be just a
381:35 - future of void and now everything should
381:38 - be okay and let's check it inside the
381:40 - emulator so let me just run the
381:49 - project so now when I want to upload a
381:51 - short video I can choose my video I will
381:55 - choose this one and then I will be
381:57 - navigated to this short video screen and
382:00 - I can modify this like I can change the
382:04 - icon specify which parts of the video I
382:06 - want to just uh get and I can just
382:08 - remove the other parts and when
382:10 - everything is done I can just hit the
382:12 - down button to actually publish the
382:14 - video and when I mean to actually export
382:17 - the video and when the video is being
382:19 - exported I will be navigated to this
382:21 - page which is short video Details page
382:23 - and of course for now it's going to be
382:25 - just a blank scaffold but now I can
382:26 - actually create the page and first of
382:29 - all at the tight I mean at a appb of
382:32 - this I want to create some stuff so let
382:34 - me just create an upo and here I have a
382:37 - title which I'm going to just give it a
382:38 - text to say video details and actually
382:43 - this is going to be the video details
382:44 - let me also give that a color I'm going
382:46 - to change the background color to
382:51 - red and also I need to change the text
382:54 - style for this TT so I'm going to just
382:56 - give it a style and then I can change
382:58 - the text style first of all I will give
383:01 - it a color of white and that should be
383:04 - all right and it was good if I could
383:07 - change the color of this arrow button as
383:09 - well but that's not for me I cannot do
383:11 - it anything okay so for now it's going
383:13 - to be okay and let me also change this
383:16 - property of Center title and I will put
383:19 - it equal to true and it will make the
383:21 - title to go in a center okay so that
383:23 - should be all right now let's work on
383:25 - the body of it and the child of this
383:28 - padding is going to be just a column and
383:30 - inside the column what I want to
383:32 - actually create is first of all a text
383:34 - field at the top and inside that text
383:37 - field I can actually fill out the
383:39 - caption for this short video and at a
383:41 - publish button I can actually publish
383:43 - the video into the fire database so
383:46 - first of all let me just create this
383:47 - text field that's going to be the text
383:49 - field let me just change this properties
383:51 - I will give it a decoration and it's
383:53 - going to be the type input
383:57 - decoration here I can give it a hand
383:59 - text and I will give it something like
384:02 - write caption
384:06 - and I can actually give it a border as
384:08 - well so I'm going to just give it a
384:10 - border and of course is going to be the
384:11 - type outline input border here I will
384:14 - have a border
384:16 - side and I will use this class Border
384:19 - Side and here I can actually change the
384:21 - color to something like maybe
384:25 - blue let's see it looks like this and
384:28 - let me also give a padding to this
384:31 - column or maybe this text build I
384:34 - actually give that padding to this color
384:36 - so I can give it a padding from the left
384:37 - side like 10 and also from the right
384:39 - side 10 and and it should be all right
384:43 - so this is going to be the padding now I
384:45 - also want to create a button at the end
384:47 - for publishing the video so I'm going to
384:50 - just go after the text field I can
384:52 - create a flat button of course it's a PR
384:54 - fidget that I have inside the starting
384:55 - project the text is going to be just
384:57 - publish the onpress is going to be just
385:00 - empty for now but later on I will use it
385:01 - to actually publish the video and the
385:04 - color of it I can be using something
385:06 - like a color of
385:09 - green okay that should be all right and
385:11 - now let me just remove this cons and put
385:14 - it here here and that should be all
385:16 - right and it looks like this and I can
385:20 - actually change that and give it let me
385:22 - just go to the column and here I will
385:24 - change the cross access alignment to
385:26 - cross access alignment do stretch now it
385:30 - should solve it and also I want to give
385:34 - it
385:34 - spacer so after the text F I can just
385:37 - have a
385:39 - spacer and that should give it a
385:41 - distance from this two and I actually
385:43 - want to give a pading to this flat
385:50 - button and I will give it a padding from
385:52 - the bottom side a padding of 30 and that
385:55 - should be all
386:00 - right and now that everything is done I
386:03 - can actually publish the video and for
386:05 - ding it let me also create a controller
386:07 - so let's change this stess widget into a
386:09 - stateful widget and then I will create a
386:12 - controller
386:14 - called caption
386:16 - controller and of course is a type text
386:19 - editing
386:20 - controller and I will just take this
386:22 - caption controller and put it inside the
386:24 - text
386:25 - field so I will give it inside this
386:29 - controller and that should be all right
386:32 - and let me just remove this cons and it
386:34 - should be all
386:36 - right so now I'm ready to actually
386:39 - publish the video and first of all let
386:43 - me just get back to the short video
386:44 - screen and here whenever I navigate to
386:48 - that page as you can see here I also
386:50 - want to give it a video so I will say
386:52 - this video and it should be just equal
386:55 - to the video that I just exported so let
386:58 - me just come here and give it a
386:59 - parameter so I'm going to just say of
387:01 - course it should be a type of file and
387:03 - I'm going to just call it video video
387:04 - let me also UT a d. iio and I will
387:08 - generate Constructor for it now I have
387:10 - to initialize it and it should be the
387:13 - video should be equal to this video that
387:15 - we are getting again from the parameter
387:17 - and of course the type is the name of it
387:19 - is short video so I'm going to just
387:21 - write like this and it should be all
387:23 - right and I need to remove this cons and
387:25 - it should be all right now I can
387:28 - actually take this video so I have
387:30 - everything right now I have the DAT
387:31 - published I can just create one that did
387:34 - publish is of course just a current time
387:36 - so I'm going to just create a dead time
387:38 - and then it will be called dead and it
387:41 - will be equal to dead
387:43 - time.
387:45 - now so I have this caption I have the
387:48 - DAT time I have the video and I also
387:51 - have the user ID it's simple getting the
387:53 - user ID I can just get I can I can just
387:56 - take the current user ID so actually I
387:59 - have everything and I can actually
388:01 - publish the video right now and for
388:03 - doing it I can create a repository so
388:06 - I'm going to just create a new folder
388:08 - called
388:10 - repository and inside that I have only
388:13 - one file called short video
388:21 - repository here I can create a class
388:24 - called short video
388:30 - repository and just like always first of
388:33 - all I need to create uh some fields for
388:36 - Firebase fire and also Firebase OD so
388:38 - I'm going to just
388:40 - create Firebase alt and I'm going to
388:43 - just call it alt and the next one I'm
388:44 - going to just create one for the
388:45 - Firebase firer and of course I'm going
388:48 - to just call it fire store and then I
388:49 - can generate Constructor for it and now
388:52 - I'll be able to use this Al and also
388:54 - fire so add short video to fire restore
388:58 - this is going to be just the first
388:59 - method here and of course it's an Asing
389:02 - this method and then I can just use this
389:03 - file
389:06 - and then I'm going to just create a new
389:08 - collection called short yeah that's
389:11 - short and then I will have a dock and
389:14 - the dock here is going to be just uh I
389:17 - can create a comment uh a short video ID
389:20 - yeah that's all right actually however I
389:23 - actually don't need to do it because the
389:25 - way I will display the short videos
389:27 - later on is something that I don't even
389:29 - need this ID so I can actually just
389:31 - remove this Doc and I I don't need to
389:34 - even set the video I can actually just
389:36 - add and the data here so this is ADD let
389:40 - me just explain to you that this add is
389:42 - another method it's an alternative for
389:44 - setting the data but the difference here
389:46 - is that I don't actually need a doc I
389:49 - can just set the data and it will just
389:51 - give it some random ID but if I use set
389:55 - I can actually uh give it my uh my
389:59 - unique ID for each uh document but
390:02 - because I don't need actually uh unique
390:04 - document for each of this uh documents
390:06 - I'm going to just use this add method
390:09 - because later on when I uh you will see
390:11 - later on that whenever I get back the
390:13 - data when I display it into the UI I
390:15 - will just display them all inside the
390:17 - list with the Builder and I actually
390:18 - don't need any ID so I'm going to just
390:21 - use add and then here I can use uh an
390:26 - inance of short video model so let me
390:27 - just create it really fast I'm going to
390:29 - just say short video model as you
390:32 - already know I have created and I'm
390:33 - going to just call it short video and it
390:35 - will be equal to short video model now
390:38 - let me just initialize this values first
390:40 - of all is the caption the user ID short
390:43 - video and that published and I will just
390:45 - take all these values from the
390:46 - parameters so let me just create that
390:48 - inside the parameters the first one is
390:51 - and all of them are going to be just
390:52 - required string
390:55 - caption the next one is going to be just
390:58 - string user
391:02 - ID string
391:05 - short video this is going to be the
391:07 - actual video and the final one is going
391:09 - to be just dead time it's going to be
391:12 - called Dead
391:15 - published why we give any error
391:21 - here okay so now it should be all right
391:24 - and I have all this one let's see what's
391:26 - a problem here the short video is
391:29 - actually
391:30 - not a string but
391:34 - let me open this short video
391:36 - model and this short video should be a
391:39 - string
391:40 - actually and there should be no
391:43 - problem yeah it's actually because of
391:45 - the renames as you can see this short
391:48 - video is actually the same to the short
391:50 - video which I have named to this in ense
391:52 - of short video model so I can actually
391:54 - change it to just video and this should
391:57 - be just all right let me also give this
391:59 - a video now everything is okay I can put
392:02 - a comma here and then a semicolon to
392:04 - reformat the codee and now inside the ad
392:07 - I can just use short video and then just
392:11 - the two
392:13 - map as you already saw we have done it
392:16 - multiple times and I will just add all
392:18 - the data inside the firer
392:21 - collection and I will also change the
392:24 - return type of it to something like a
392:25 - future of void and it should be all
392:27 - right now I will get back to the short
392:30 - video Details page and right here I can
392:33 - just say actually first of all I need to
392:35 - create a provider for this just like
392:37 - always let me just remove this
392:40 - too and here I'm going to just create a
392:43 - provider I will name it short video
392:47 - provider and it's going to be just like
392:49 - always equal to simple provider and here
392:51 - I will return short video repository the
392:54 - art is going to be just F this fire
392:57 - fireb
393:00 - offense I will do the same for the fire
393:02 - as well
393:04 - and that should be all
393:07 - right okay now let's actually publish
393:10 - the video right here and for doing it I
393:13 - need to convert this stateful widget
393:15 - into a consumer stateful widget so let
393:18 - me just import this and then I will take
393:20 - this consumer I put it right here and
393:24 - also here now I will be able to use this
393:28 - riff and I'm going to just say
393:30 - riffat and then I will use short video
393:35 - provider and then I can use this method
393:38 - add short video to the fer and the
393:40 - caption here is going to be just the
393:41 - caption controller. text the user ID is
393:45 - going to be just actually let me remove
393:48 - this user ID I don't need to initialize
393:51 - this value here and then I will get back
393:54 - to the short video repository because I
393:56 - have the OD actually here I don't need
393:57 - to uh give it a parameter so I will
394:00 - remove this user ID I don't need to take
394:03 - this as parameter and here the user ID
394:06 - is going to be just. karing user. uid
394:09 - and that should be all right okay and
394:14 - the next one is the video which I can
394:15 - just give it the viget do video and
394:19 - actually it's a type of file not a
394:21 - string so let me just check that and
394:24 - actually I can take the path yeah I me
394:27 - just say widget. video dop because I
394:31 - just want to store the path of this
394:34 - video and then the date publish is going
394:36 - to be just something like that which is
394:39 - the DAT time now and you already know so
394:43 - now it should be all right let me just
394:45 - synchronize this
394:46 - method and also make this a wait now
394:50 - everything should be okay and we will be
394:52 - able to actually upload the short video
394:55 - so now that we have upload the short
394:57 - video I need somewhere to actually get
394:59 - back the short videos and display it
395:01 - into a UI and inside a page
395:04 - and for doing it I need to go to the
395:06 - content feature and right here I have
395:08 - comments long video and the next I will
395:11 - create a new folder called short
395:14 - video okay now inside this short video I
395:18 - can just create a folder called pages
395:21 - and the first file is going to be Just
395:24 - sh video
395:28 - page okay now I'm going to just import
395:30 - the material. dart and create an thisel
395:34 - called short video
395:38 - page just like always let's create this
395:41 - scaffold inside the body I'm going to
395:43 - just create a safe area the child is
395:45 - going to be just a
395:46 - padding and I will have only a padding
395:49 - from the right uh from the top
395:51 - side and it's going to be just a padding
395:54 - of
395:56 - 20 okay now the sh for this padding is
395:59 - going to be just a column or actually I
396:02 - don't need it this column and I'm going
396:04 - to just display the data inside the N
396:06 - stream
396:07 - Builder okay that should be all right
396:10 - now I actually want to display the the
396:12 - data and just like always I can do it
396:14 - using an stream Builder and here the
396:18 - stream is going to be just the Firebase
396:19 - fire restore let me just create an any
396:21 - sense of Firebase fire restor and then
396:24 - I'm going to just open the collection of
396:26 - shirts where I just store all the short
396:29 - videos and then I can just say snapshots
396:31 - because and here I don't need any
396:34 - condition I don't need anything I just
396:35 - want to get all the data back it means
396:38 - all the sh videos back and then inside
396:41 - the Builder I want to create first of
396:44 - all some conditions which uh I'm going
396:46 - to just say if the data is not equal to
396:49 - I mean if it don't have the data so I'm
396:51 - going to just say the snapshot. data is
396:54 - equal to null or for example if snapshot
396:58 - so here I'm going to just say if a
397:00 - snapshot. data is equal to n or a
397:02 - snapshot. has data is not true just like
397:04 - always I'm going to just return this
397:06 - error page and in the next one I'm going
397:09 - to just say if snapshot do connection
397:12 - set is equal to connection set. waiting
397:16 - which in this case I'm going to just
397:17 - return the loader and finally when I get
397:21 - back the data I just want to return a
397:23 - list view.
397:26 - Builder here the inside the item Builder
397:28 - I can actually once again create this
397:30 - one I'm going to put a semicolon right
397:33 - here and actually I get the data and
397:35 - displayed right here so to get the data
397:37 - I'm going to just
397:39 - say snapshot. data. docs and it will
397:43 - just give me all the documents back I'm
397:45 - going to just put exclamation mark right
397:46 - here and then I will store it inside a
397:50 - variable called short videos or short
397:54 - video Maps the next I'm going to just I
397:56 - want to take each of this short videos
397:59 - so I'm I can just uh take one of them so
398:01 - I'm going to just and actually you want
398:03 - to convert it into a short video model
398:05 - so I'm going to just say short uh video
398:08 - model this is going to be the data type
398:10 - the data type and then I'm going to name
398:13 - it short video and it will be equal to
398:15 - short video model. from map and the map
398:20 - here is going to be just short video
398:22 - maps and I will just take each of this
398:25 - indexes yeah and actually here I need to
398:27 - specify the data because I don't want it
398:30 - to be like this and I actually want the
398:32 - data so that should be all right let me
398:34 - just remove
398:36 - this so what I have done here is just
398:38 - like always I get all the docks here
398:40 - which is of course that the short videos
398:42 - and then I convert it into a short video
398:44 - model just like this and now finally I
398:48 - just want to
398:49 - return uh a short video tile which I
398:53 - need to create so I'm going to just do
398:56 - like this and later on I can just create
398:58 - that I'm going to just create a new
399:00 - folder called widgets and inside that I
399:02 - can create this short video
399:06 - tile just like always let me just import
399:08 - the
399:09 - material. create the St this wiget
399:12 - called short video tile and now I can
399:16 - actually import
399:18 - this and that should be all right and
399:21 - this short video to takes a short video
399:24 - model as parameter so I'm going to just
399:26 - create this short video model I'm going
399:28 - to just call it short video then I can
399:32 - generate Constructor for it and that
399:33 - should be all right now let me also give
399:36 - value to the short video which is going
399:37 - to be equal to short video okay now
399:41 - everything should be good and we can
399:43 - actually display the data let me just
399:45 - create this short video to and this
399:47 - short video to is going to be just each
399:49 - short video that you want to display
399:51 - it's just the actual video the title of
399:54 - the video and then the date publish
399:56 - that's
399:57 - all so let me just create it instead of
400:00 - this placeholder I can actually return a
400:03 - p
400:04 - padding and here I will have a padding
400:06 - from the top
400:09 - side and then the child is going to be
400:12 - just a
400:14 - column so now uh for actually displaying
400:18 - the video I need to convert into a
400:20 - stateful widget and then I need to
400:22 - initialize this video player
400:26 - and first of all let me in uh let me
400:29 - just create the configuration for using
400:30 - the video player package and first of
400:33 - all I need to import
400:35 - that let me just import the video player
400:38 - because we want to display a video
401:16 - and for creating the configuration for
401:18 - video player first of all I need to
401:20 - create a controller so I'm going to just
401:21 - call it short video controller and
401:25 - initially it will be it will not be
401:27 - equal to anything so then I need to also
401:30 - specify the data type which is going to
401:31 - be just video player
401:34 - controller and that should be all right
401:37 - of course it's not final then I need to
401:39 - create an init set because the
401:42 - initialization and configuration will be
401:45 - done inside this and set and I can just
401:47 - do like this the name of the controller
401:49 - is short video controller and that
401:51 - should be all right I just need to take
401:54 - this and instead of this thing I need to
401:57 - actually show the actual
402:01 - video and the actual video here is going
402:03 - to be just the short video which I take
402:06 - from the parameters let me just first of
402:08 - all use a
402:09 - widget short video and the actual sh
402:14 - video that should be all right and this
402:17 - is the actual video which want to
402:20 - display and now inside the column I can
402:23 - just say whenever the short video
402:28 - controller is initialized
402:35 - I just want to check if this is
402:36 - initialized let me also put an
402:38 - exclamation mark here and only in this
402:41 - case I just want to show the as the
402:43 - actual value so I'm going to just create
402:45 - an this aspect ratio the aspect ratio
402:47 - here is going to be
402:49 - just L1 to 16 and that should be all
402:52 - right and the child is going to be just
402:54 - the
402:55 - video player and the controller is going
402:58 - to be just short video
403:01 - controller okay so that should be all
403:04 - right right now if we if the data is
403:07 - initialized I want to display this but
403:09 - if it is not initialized I'm going to
403:10 - just return something like a size
403:14 - box okay so now it should be all right
403:18 - and then we also put a cons here
403:20 - actually I'm not going to do this inside
403:22 - here but I need to do it for the column
403:25 - okay it should be right here I'll put
403:27 - this and then like
403:28 - this and this should be actually right
403:32 - here
403:34 - now after displaying the video I also
403:35 - want to display the caption and also the
403:38 - DAT publish so let me just create a row
403:41 - and right here I can actually create a
403:43 - text and then uh here I'm going to
403:45 - display the caption so I can actually
403:48 - display the actual caption I don't need
403:49 - to give it a hard code and here I'm
403:51 - going to just
403:53 - use this uh widget. short video. caption
404:00 - and let me just change the text style
404:02 - here so I will change the style property
404:04 - here and the text style is going to be
404:06 - just the F size of 20 and also a f Way
404:09 - of Bolt so now it should be all right
404:11 - let me just give it a const and then
404:14 - after this text I also want to display
404:16 - the de publish so let me just give it
404:17 - one another text and here the de publish
404:20 - is going to be just short video and here
404:25 - just the de published and then that
404:28 - should be all right let me also just
404:30 - convert it into a string and just just
404:33 - one thing that remember for displaying
404:35 - the date published and for displaying
404:37 - dates inside this project I'm going to
404:39 - use a package called time ago so I have
404:43 - already installed it inside my ppml file
404:45 - let me just show it to you it's going to
404:48 - be just this package and using this I
404:49 - can actually display the dates very
404:52 - beautifully and you can also just
404:54 - install this and then you'll be able to
404:55 - do so I will just import this
405:01 - package and now right here I can use a
405:04 - class of this uh actually first of all I
405:07 - need to make this time ago as like this
405:10 - so I'm going to just say I will use this
405:11 - as time ago and then I will be able to
405:13 - use
405:17 - that time ago. format and here the DAT
405:20 - is going to be just like this let me
405:22 - just remove this because I should not
405:24 - use I should not convert into a string
405:26 - and right now it should be all
405:29 - right so now everything is actually done
405:32 - let me also to change the main access
405:34 - alignment inside this row and I will
405:37 - give it something like the space
405:40 - between and now everything should be
405:43 - okay now I have to do one last step and
405:46 - inside the list with. Builder I need to
405:47 - add the item count property and the
405:49 - value of it is going to be just equal to
405:51 - snapshot. data. dos. length and it's
405:55 - basically just the number of short
405:58 - videos that we have inside this
405:59 - collection now everything is perfect and
406:02 - let's check if it's working or not so
406:03 - I'm going to just run the
406:09 - emulator now let's sayest if it's
406:11 - working or not so I'm going to just
406:13 - click right here to create a
406:16 - short I will just choose this
406:18 - video and now I will be navigated to
406:21 - this page which allow me to actually
406:23 - edit this short video I can choose
406:25 - whichever part of this video that I want
406:27 - and this is the demo of the video and
406:29 - once I'm done with everything I can just
406:31 - click here done to export the video and
406:34 - once it's exported I will be navigated
406:35 - to this video Details page which inside
406:38 - I can actually uh write a caption to
406:40 - this video and once I click on this
406:42 - button it will be published to the fire
406:44 - database so let me just give it a
406:46 - caption and I will just write first
406:49 - short video and I will hit
406:55 - publish now this video should be
406:57 - published so let's go and check the
406:59 - Firebase console to see if it's working
407:01 - or not and this collection of shirts is
407:03 - being created or not so let's just check
407:05 - it on I'm going to just uh refresh this
407:11 - page so as you can see this new
407:13 - collection of shirts is being created
407:15 - and in this collection the first video
407:18 - and the first short video is just like
407:20 - this the caption is first short video
407:22 - this is a dead publish short video this
407:23 - is the actual video and also this is
407:25 - going to be the user ID which is
407:27 - starting with B4 EP and this is my
407:29 - current user and my channel so the video
407:31 - is uploaded successfully and I just need
407:33 - to show it in the UI and of course I
407:35 - have already created that uh sh video
407:38 - page as you can see this is going to be
407:40 - the page actually the name is short
407:43 - video page yeah this is the page and I
407:46 - just need to put this page somewhere so
407:49 - first of all let me just uh close all
407:51 - the unnecessary pages and now I'm going
407:53 - to just open the page list and in the
407:56 - second page instead of just this Center
407:58 - text to say sh I'm going to just put the
408:00 - actual page so the name of page is just
408:03 - short video page and I have to just
408:04 - import it and it should be all right now
408:08 - let's check it out let me just do a hard
408:10 - restart
408:13 - first so now in the second page it
408:16 - should be the all the short videos and
408:18 - as you can see this is going to be the
408:19 - short video this is the demo of the
408:21 - video and this is the title first short
408:23 - video and also this is the date
408:25 - published 4 minutes ago so everything is
408:27 - working perfectly fine and the last
408:30 - thing that I need to do here is first of
408:32 - all give a p to this dead publish and
408:34 - also the title and also I want to be
408:36 - able to open this video I want to be
408:38 - able to pause and also play this video
408:41 - whenever I click on it I should be able
408:42 - to play it so let's work on this first
408:46 - let me just open the short video tile
408:49 - and inside that I'm going to just give a
408:50 - padding to this row at the bottom I'm
408:53 - going to just drop it with the
408:55 - padding and I will just give it a
408:57 - padding only from the right side a
408:59 - padding of 10 and also from the left
409:01 - side again a padding of 10 so that
409:04 - should be all right and it should be
409:07 - good yeah this is great and let me also
409:09 - give it a padding from the top side I
409:11 - think it's also good and I will give it
409:13 - a padding of something like six and it
409:15 - should be
409:18 - great yeah and the final thing is to
409:20 - just be able to play this video so let
409:22 - me just come here so I'm going to just
409:24 - wrap this aspect ratio with a gure
409:27 - detector and on the on property I will
409:29 - create this logic that whenever I click
409:31 - on this if it's not playing it should
409:34 - play and if it's playing it should just
409:35 - pause so let me just use this short
409:38 - video controller do value and then I'm
409:41 - going to just say if it's uh
409:45 - playing actually I need to create this
409:48 - inside condition so I'm going to just
409:50 - say if this is the case let me just put
409:52 - an exclamation mark here and also an
409:54 - exclamation mark at the beginning and
409:56 - what does it really mean is that short
409:59 - video controller. value that is playing
410:01 - but it's not true it means if the video
410:03 - is not playing in this case only I want
410:06 - it to be played so I'm going to just say
410:09 - value. playay or actually I don't need
410:11 - to use the value and I'm going to just
410:12 - say play the video and else if it's not
410:16 - the case I wanted the video to be pause
410:19 - so I'm going to just say short video
410:20 - controller do pause okay this is done
410:24 - the only thing I did was that I'm saying
410:27 - that if the video is not playing it
410:28 - should play the video and in the else
410:30 - cases it means that if the video is not
410:33 - it means if the video is playing in this
410:35 - case pause the video now it should be
410:36 - great and if I come here and click on
410:40 - the short video it should start playing
410:42 - and when I click again it stops when I
410:44 - click again it start again so everything
410:47 - is working perfectly fine and we are
410:48 - done with the short
410:52 - videos now let's just work on the final
410:54 - feature for this project which is going
410:56 - to be the search feature and I also want
410:57 - to be able to and let users be able to
411:01 - search both video videos and also
411:03 - channels so this is going to be the last
411:05 - feature that I'm going to add in this
411:06 - project so let's create it real quick
411:09 - inside the features folder I'm going to
411:10 - create a new folder called search and
411:14 - here let me just find
411:16 - it actually I can create a new folder
411:19 - inside it and the first one is going to
411:20 - be for Pages the second one is going to
411:22 - be for the wigets and the final one is
411:25 - going to be just for the
411:28 - providers so first of all I want to work
411:30 - on the UI of the search screen so let me
411:32 - just create create a new file inside the
411:33 - pages folder called search
411:36 - screen and after I'm done with the UI I
411:38 - can just work on the functionality of
411:40 - actually searching videos and channels
411:42 - so let me just import material. Dart
411:45 - then I can create an status fidget call
411:47 - it search
411:51 - screen and just like always I'm going to
411:53 - just return a simple
411:56 - scaffold and inside the body once again
411:59 - safe area the child is going to be just
412:02 - a padding and I will give it a padding
412:04 - from the top side just like always a
412:06 - padding of 20 okay so I'm done now here
412:10 - and the CH of this padding is going to
412:12 - be just a column and I will create
412:15 - everything inside this column so first
412:17 - of all let me tell you how this page is
412:18 - going to look like actually I want to
412:20 - create a page and first of all inside
412:22 - this column I will create a row and
412:24 - inside that row I will have an icon
412:26 - button and just an arrow button then
412:29 - next I want to create a text field which
412:30 - inside users will be able to se for the
412:32 - both videos and users so just is going
412:34 - to be just a simple text field and the
412:36 - final one I'm going to just add a search
412:38 - button which whenever user clicks on
412:40 - them they will be able to search for the
412:43 - videos and channels and everything and
412:45 - of course after at the end of the column
412:47 - I want to show all the uh found items so
412:50 - let's just create them as I said first
412:52 - let's work on the UI so I'm going to
412:54 - just create it real quick as you already
412:56 - see in the video this is the page that I
412:58 - want to create so first of all let's
413:01 - have a row
413:04 - and inside the Row first of all I have
413:06 - this icon button the unpress is going to
413:09 - be just empty for now and the icon is
413:11 - going to be just an icon of Arrow so I
413:14 - have this Arrow back this is the icon
413:17 - that I use here and I will just use this
413:19 - to navigate it back to the previous
413:20 - pitch let's also put some cons here to
413:23 - remove this blue
413:24 - warnings and after this icon button I
413:27 - actually want to create a text field so
413:29 - I'm going to just create a text form
413:31 - field here and and first of all let's
413:33 - change the UI for this text form field
413:35 - so I'm going to give it a decoration and
413:37 - using the input decoration I will give
413:39 - it some Styles first of all the hand
413:41 - text I will just give it a hand text of
413:43 - something like
413:44 - search
413:49 - YouTube and I also want to give it a
413:51 - border so I'm going to just use the
413:53 - outline inut border class and in the
413:56 - Border site I can use this class to
413:59 - actually change the color of this body
414:01 - border of this text F so I'm going to
414:03 - just change the color to something like
414:07 - maybe
414:08 - blue okay that's all right now let me
414:11 - just put this class somewhere in my
414:12 - project so I'm going to just take the
414:13 - search screen and find this Pages list
414:17 - and for now I'm going to just put this
414:18 - as a first list because it it makes my
414:20 - life much easier to see the changes
414:22 - inside this page but later on when I'm
414:24 - done with this page I will put it as a
414:25 - third page after the long video and
414:27 - short video pages but for now it's going
414:29 - to be just okay and let me just to hard
414:32 - start that you can see the changes of
414:34 - this search screen and I'm going to also
414:36 - just remove on the all the an necessary
414:38 - pages so I don't need them I'm currently
414:41 - working on this search screen and as you
414:43 - can see this is the icon button and I
414:45 - also need to wrap this side this uh text
414:48 - from filled with a size box that
414:49 - actually I can see it so let me just
414:52 - wrap it to the size box and here I'm
414:56 - going to give it a height of something
414:57 - like 50 and also a weight of like 200
415:04 - and this is the pitch I actually need to
415:05 - increase the width for this so I'm going
415:07 - to give it something like 200
415:10 - 2080 and that should be much better or
415:14 - 70 is I believe it's
415:16 - okay so this is what I got it now and
415:19 - I'm going to also decrease the height to
415:20 - 45 and I think it is
415:23 - better and that's all right I also want
415:26 - to give this a border radius for this
415:29 - text F and for now this uh UI for the
415:32 - text is going to be okay but at the end
415:34 - I'm going to change this a little bit
415:35 - but for now let's be okay and continue
415:38 - with this so here I'm going to just use
415:40 - a preu widget called custom bottom it is
415:43 - a preu widget which I have already
415:45 - created and of course if you have
415:46 - downloaded the starting project you have
415:48 - all of them so I now have to initialize
415:50 - some of the values like icon data on T
415:52 - and half color and everything the icon
415:55 - is going to be just something icon.
415:57 - search we have this from the flutter
415:59 - itself the on Tab is going to be just
416:01 - empty for now and Al the half color it
416:03 - will be equal to
416:06 - true so that's uh so this should be all
416:08 - right and I should be able to see the
416:11 - icon actually here and this is going to
416:13 - be the icon and I also want to wrap this
416:15 - with a size box to give it my favorite
416:19 - uh height and weight so let me just give
416:22 - it a height of 34 and also a weight of
416:26 - 65 I believe that is the correct weight
416:29 - let's just check it out so this is what
416:31 - I have created created so far and
416:33 - actually I want to increase the height
416:35 - and a little the width for this uh
416:38 - search button so I'm going to just
416:39 - increase the height to something like 39
416:41 - and I hope this fits this and I believe
416:44 - this is beautiful and later on if I want
416:46 - I can actually change the UI for this
416:47 - pitch much more and improve the UI and
416:50 - the ux for this page but for now I'm
416:52 - going to just be okay and now let's
416:54 - create the uh search user tile widget
416:57 - because whenever I'm uh searching for
417:00 - users so I should be able to see some
417:02 - users and I need to create that uh
417:05 - widget so as you can see in the page
417:07 - this is the exact widget that I want to
417:09 - create right now so I'm going to create
417:11 - a new file called search user tile
417:13 - widget or search channel tile widget so
417:17 - I'm going to create this page first of
417:19 - all let me just import the material.
417:21 - dart and create an status fet I'm going
417:24 - to just call it search channel tile I'm
417:29 - going to just call it like this and then
417:31 - I can actually create this page so as
417:34 - you saw in the video this is the page
417:36 - that I want to create and we will have a
417:39 - circle aatar first of all we have a row
417:41 - I have a circle AAR and the next child
417:43 - is going to be just a column inside
417:45 - which I display the display name the
417:47 - usern name number of subscriptions and
417:49 - also I want to have a subscribe button
417:52 - which all user to subscribe the
417:53 - specified channel so let's just create
417:55 - it first of all I will have a row and
417:57 - inside the children first of all I want
417:59 - to have a circle Avatar and the circle
418:02 - of water has a radius of 40 or 45 and
418:06 - also I would give it a background color
418:08 - of
418:10 - gray and I also want to wrap this uh row
418:14 - with a padding because I need to have
418:16 - some paddings from different directions
418:18 - like from the top side and also from
418:21 - left and right s side maybe so first of
418:23 - all Let me give it a padding from the
418:24 - top sides and a padding of 10 so after
418:27 - the circle aat I want to have the next
418:29 - child to be a column and inside this
418:32 - column I actually want to create first
418:35 - of all a display name so let me just
418:37 - create a Tex and I'm going to just call
418:38 - it Ahmed amini this is my display name I
418:41 - also change a style for this
418:43 - and I'm going to just give it a f size
418:46 - of 17 and also a f
418:49 - way and the F way that I'm going to just
418:52 - use here uh I'm going to just use a
418:53 - Funway of
418:56 - w500 okay after the display name I need
418:58 - to create a username so let me just
419:01 - create one
419:02 - I'm going to just call it AD Sign Ahmed
419:05 - amini this is going to be my hardcoded
419:08 - username but later on I will actually
419:10 - give it the actual username that I have
419:12 - but for now let's work on the UI as I
419:15 - said so the text St here I'm going to
419:17 - just give it a color of blue
419:22 - gray and I also want to change the phone
419:24 - size to something like tur in I want to
419:27 - make it a
419:28 - smaller and after the username I want to
419:30 - create the number of subscription
419:33 - and it's going to be for now just no
419:37 - subscriptions and again I want to give
419:39 - it a color of let me just change the
419:41 - text
419:43 - style and I will give it a color of blue
419:49 - gray okay this should be all right and
419:52 - I'm not going to change the F size for
419:53 - now and at the end I just want to create
419:56 - a subscribe button so let me just create
419:58 - that one as well and it's going to be
420:00 - just a flat button as you can see the
420:03 - text here is going to be just
420:05 - subscribe the unpress is going to be
420:07 - just empty for now and the color is
420:10 - going to be just
420:12 - black I think it looks
420:16 - perfect okay this should be it and now I
420:19 - want to actually use this that I can see
420:21 - the UI for this one so let me just take
420:24 - this and inside the search
420:26 - screen uh right here outside of the row
420:29 - and inside the column I want to display
420:31 - it in inside for now I'm going to just
420:34 - show hard Cod it I don't need to use any
420:36 - stream Builder or list with Builder I'm
420:38 - going to just do like this and this is
420:41 - what I have created so far and I need to
420:44 - actually change it a little so let me
420:46 - just get back uh I want to make this
420:48 - circle aat is smaller and also I need to
420:50 - change the main AIS alignment for this
420:53 - row and the main AIS alignment is going
420:55 - to be just something like space let's
420:58 - use a space around or maybe I should
421:01 - give it a space m or that's not looking
421:05 - very nice so I'm going to just use a
421:06 - space
421:07 - between and right now I also want to
421:10 - give an spor at the end of this row that
421:13 - makes that brings this column to this
421:15 - right here so at the end of this column
421:19 - or I should say at the end of the row I
421:21 - want to have a spacer ret yeah so let me
421:24 - just create an spacer here and now it's
421:26 - like here and I also want to give a
421:28 - padding to this column I'm going to give
421:30 - it a padding from the left and also from
421:32 - the right side so I will just give it a
421:37 - padding from the right side a padding of
421:40 - something or maybe from the left side
421:41 - ping like 20 and that should be all
421:44 - right or let me give it something like
421:48 - 35 and or I believe it should be
421:53 - 45 so for now it's going to be guess
421:56 - okay and I love this so I also want to
421:58 - change the radius for this circle aor
422:00 - and I I just give it 40 and this should
422:03 - be perfect for this thing and also let
422:07 - me just change the uh pading I'm going
422:10 - to also give a padding to this Row from
422:12 - the left side and a padding of
422:14 - 10 and that should be perfect so now I
422:18 - have this I also want to change the UI
422:20 - for this subscribe button and I need to
422:23 - make uh make this subscribe button to
422:26 - have a little smaller height and also I
422:28 - will widen this button so I'm going to
422:31 - just need to to wrap this flat button
422:33 - with a size
422:36 - box I will change the height to like
422:40 - 40 and I also want to give it a v so let
422:45 - me just give it a v of something like 80
422:47 - and that should be perfect or I should
422:50 - increase it to something like
422:52 - 130 or 20 is okay as well or maybe even
422:56 - 10 because that looks perfect and now I
423:00 - also want to give this a size box to
423:03 - this subscribe button from the top side
423:05 - and I need to create a size box
423:10 - here and I will give it a height of like
423:13 - eight from the top side so that should
423:16 - be
423:18 - okay so now I have this and the search
423:21 - tile user widget is perfect and that is
423:23 - the way I want to and again if I want to
423:25 - improve the UI for this I can do it
423:27 - later on but for now let's be done with
423:29 - the UI and let's work on the logic for
423:33 - so first of all let's create the
423:35 - providers and inside this search and
423:37 - providers I'm going to just create a new
423:39 - file called search
423:43 - providers and here I need to actually
423:46 - create two providers one for the videos
423:48 - and also the next one is going to be for
423:49 - the channels so I'm going to just create
423:51 - both of them so the first one I'm going
423:53 - to just create call it all channels
423:56 - provider and using this provider I just
423:59 - want to get and retrieve all the
424:01 - channels POS possible inside this
424:03 - project so it means all channels or all
424:05 - users and let's create this simple
424:09 - provider and now I want to get back all
424:11 - the channels and to get the channels
424:14 - it's really simple it's not a big deal I
424:16 - can just use the Firebase fire store I'm
424:18 - going to just do it manually myself I
424:20 - don't need to use any provider or
424:21 - anything right here I'm going to just
424:23 - create an inance of Firebase fire store
424:25 - then I'm going to go inside the
424:27 - collection of users then I'm going to
424:30 - just get back all the channel
424:32 - and users inside this project of course
424:35 - I need to make this in and await this
424:39 - method now I'm going to just store this
424:42 - inside a variable called users map and
424:46 - this should be all right now I want to
424:49 - take each of the users from this users
424:53 - map so I'm going to just say users map
424:56 - and of course it's an iterable and then
424:58 - I can get all the docs of course now
425:01 - it's a list of variables and then I can
425:02 - use a method called map and this map
425:05 - just give me back each of the user so
425:08 - I'm going to just call this
425:10 - user and now what I want to do here is
425:13 - to actually use the user model and here
425:16 - I'm going to use a method called first
425:18 - of all let me just import this here I
425:21 - can use a method called from map and
425:23 - using this from map I can take each of
425:25 - this users and then I want to convert
425:28 - them into a model of user model and Fin
425:31 - finally at the end I want to convert
425:33 - everything into a list so let me just
425:36 - explain what I have done here first of
425:38 - all I will put some comments here to
425:39 - refer my deod what actually I have done
425:42 - here is first of all I took uh I went
425:44 - into the collection of users and
425:46 - restored them all inside a variable
425:48 - called users map and then I took docs
425:52 - and using this docs it means all the
425:53 - channels or all the users and then I use
425:56 - the map method to take each of the user
425:58 - from this collection from this list and
426:00 - then I convert them into a user model
426:02 - because I need a user model and not a
426:04 - map and then I finally convert
426:07 - everything into a list the result is
426:09 - going to be just a list of user
426:11 - models and I'm going to just call it
426:14 - users so that should be all right and
426:16 - finally I want to return this users and
426:19 - it's going to be just the return of this
426:21 - provider I exactly want to do the same
426:23 - for a video so let me just take this and
426:25 - copy one more time I'm going to just
426:27 - call this one all videos provider
426:32 - and this time I want to go inside the
426:34 - collection of videos and get everything
426:36 - and I'm going to just call it videos
426:40 - map then I will take each of this videos
426:43 - map I will have the docs and I want to
426:46 - do a map method here I will call it
426:49 - videos and of course this is going to be
426:50 - a a list of video
426:53 - models now I want to take each of the
426:55 - video and here I'm going to just use the
426:58 - video model and here let me just just
427:01 - Chang this to video and also here I'm
427:03 - going to just return a list of videos so
427:07 - now I have two providers one for the
427:09 - videos and one for the channels and
427:10 - using these two providers I can take all
427:12 - the videos and all the channels right
427:15 - here now let's get back to the search
427:18 - screen and here I can display all of
427:21 - them using a list. builder so first of
427:23 - all let me just create an expanded
427:25 - widget and the child is going to be just
427:26 - a simple list view.
427:29 - Builder and let me just tell you how I'm
427:32 - going to do this here we have the item
427:35 - Builder and that should be all right and
427:38 - I also have an item count and actually
427:40 - the way I want to create this uh first
427:43 - of all I will convert this St vet into a
427:45 - St vet and then inside this that I can
427:48 - create a list and this list is going to
427:51 - just called found items and for now it's
427:53 - going to be just empty and this found
427:56 - items is basically all the items that I
427:58 - have found all the videos in channels
428:01 - and everything all of them are going to
428:02 - just be inside this found items list so
428:06 - now let's get back to the list with that
428:07 - Builder here the item count is going to
428:10 - be just found items do length because as
428:14 - much item that we have right there it
428:16 - will be the item count for this list
428:17 - with that Builder and right here I'm
428:19 - going to just display all of them but
428:20 - before that I need to create a meod to
428:23 - filter the list because actually I don't
428:25 - want to just display all the videos or
428:27 - all the users that I have in the project
428:30 - I just want to display all the videos or
428:32 - users that the user have searched let me
428:35 - just explain myself I just want to
428:37 - display the searched or a specified
428:39 - users and videos based on what users
428:42 - have searched so for example if they
428:44 - search ah all the videos and channels
428:47 - that have this specific keywords they
428:49 - will be appear into the page so not all
428:52 - of them and for filtering the list I
428:54 - need to create a method here and I'm
428:56 - going to just create after this variable
428:59 - and I will just call it filter
429:02 - uh list okay this method is going to be
429:05 - just a syn I believe and I will just
429:08 - need to create them first of all uh I
429:11 - need to change this stateful widget into
429:13 - a consumer stateful widget because I
429:14 - need to use the providers that I just
429:16 - created a moment ago let me just import
429:18 - this and take this consumer and I will
429:20 - put it right here and also right there
429:23 - now I can use this refi to connect
429:26 - between different providers that I have
429:28 - and here I want to just first of all get
429:30 - all the channels that I have so I'm
429:32 - going to just use this all channels
429:34 - provider so now first of all I'm going
429:36 - to just get all the channels and as you
429:37 - know the result of this provider is just
429:40 - all the channel or I can just say as the
429:42 - result is a list of user models and I
429:47 - can just call it users let me just
429:49 - import this and that should be all right
429:51 - let's see what's wrong here and I also
429:53 - need to await
429:55 - this so now I have the users but I as I
429:58 - said before I don't want to display all
430:00 - the users I just just want to display a
430:02 - specified users that user have searched
430:05 - the specified users not all of them so
430:08 - for doing it I can actually create a
430:10 - condition I'm going to just say users
430:13 - and then I will use a method called
430:15 - where and using this where I can
430:16 - actually create a condition to say this
430:19 - element each of them is going to be just
430:21 - a user and here I want to create a where
430:25 - it means which users do I want to
430:27 - display and I'm going to just say each
430:29 - of the user that has actually a display
430:31 - name so I'm going to just search the
430:33 - users based on their display name and
430:35 - I'm going to just say user. display name
430:37 - do to string do to lower case so I will
430:41 - get the display name of the user and
430:44 - then I'm going to just say if it
430:45 - contains what I want which is going to
430:47 - be just the keyword that the user has
430:50 - just searched and I need to do it using
430:52 - a parameter so I'm going to just say
430:53 - keyword selected and I will just create
430:56 - here and I'm going to just say string
430:58 - keyword selected I will just uh fill
431:00 - that as parameter so if the display name
431:02 - of the user I going to convert it to
431:04 - string and then to ler case and if it
431:06 - contains if it contains the keyword
431:08 - selected in this case only I want to
431:10 - convert that into a list and do that
431:12 - stuff so I'm going to just say in this
431:15 - case I'm going to just convert it into a
431:17 - list all the users that has this
431:19 - condition I'm going to convert all of
431:21 - them into a list and finally store it
431:23 - inside a variable called found channels
431:27 - this is going to be the found channels
431:29 - and I can actually do the same for the
431:30 - video as well so let me just copy it one
431:32 - more time and in this case I'm going to
431:35 - call it found videos and I'm going to
431:38 - just map or fear and I'm going to just
431:40 - go through each of the video here let me
431:43 - just rename this to video and everything
431:47 - I also need to actually return something
431:49 - here so this should be returned here and
431:51 - also
431:54 - here and everything should be okay right
431:56 - now so these are the found channels and
431:59 - also these are going to be the found
432:01 - videos and here inside this method not
432:05 - outside I want to create another list
432:07 - which I'm going to just call it result
432:09 - and again it's going to be just empty
432:10 - for now okay so now I have this result
432:13 - and what I want to do is to add all the
432:15 - found channels and videos inside this
432:17 - result so I can just say
432:19 - result and then I'm going to use add and
432:22 - also I have this at all and I'm going to
432:24 - just use at all because I want to add a
432:26 - list to this result and here I'm going
432:28 - to add all the found channels right here
432:31 - so if you don't know and if you happen
432:33 - to use this at all it's actually a
432:35 - method that you can add a list into
432:37 - another list so what I'm doing right now
432:39 - is I'm adding a list of found channels
432:41 - into the list of result and I can just
432:44 - do it using this add all and actually I
432:46 - can do the same for the videos so I'm
432:48 - going to just say result. add
432:51 - all and I'm going to just add all the
432:54 - videos right here and at the end I'm
432:57 - going to just use a set set and inside
432:59 - the set set first of all I will Shuffle
433:02 - this list of uh result so let me just
433:04 - use the shuffle method it's going to
433:06 - just uh randomize all the items inside
433:09 - this rist of results because I don't
433:10 - want to be I don't want it to be a
433:12 - specific or for example first of all
433:14 - videos channels I want it to be shuffled
433:16 - and at the end I'm going to just add
433:19 - everything inside the list of results
433:21 - into this list of found items so I can
433:24 - just say found item should be equal to
433:27 - result and using this everything inside
433:30 - the result will be inside the found
433:32 - items so right now this list that I just
433:34 - created uh at the beginning this list of
433:37 - found items it has all the videos and
433:40 - channels so I can display it into this
433:42 - list with that Builder that I have
433:44 - created and actually I want to create
433:47 - another list inside list with Builder
433:49 - and it's going to be just a list for the
433:51 - widget because this found items is
433:53 - containing models it's not containing
433:55 - widgets but I need to work with the
433:57 - widgets and not models so I'm going to
433:59 - just uh create this list and I can just
434:01 - call it found you know items yeah this
434:04 - is the name found items and of course
434:06 - it's going to be just once again empty
434:08 - for
434:10 - now and here what I can actually do so
434:14 - this list of found items is going to
434:16 - just contain all the wigets into that
434:19 - list and as you know I have this found
434:22 - items and if I use the index inside that
434:25 - it means that each of this uh which I'm
434:28 - going to just call this variable uh
434:29 - something like selected item and what I
434:32 - mean by item is that it's not uh
434:35 - specified whe whether it is a video or a
434:38 - channel that's why I'm going to call it
434:40 - selected item so now the selected item
434:42 - is whether a video or it can be maybe a
434:45 - channel so now the final part is going
434:48 - to be just I need to create some
434:49 - conditions to see if it's a video or if
434:52 - it's a user and if it was a video I'm
434:55 - going to add a post or a video into the
434:57 - list of found items and if it is a user
435:01 - I'm going to add that one uh the search
435:03 - user tile widget into this list and if
435:05 - you wonder how can I do it I can do it
435:07 - using the type fill that I have created
435:09 - inside both users and also videos and as
435:12 - you remember from the previous that I
435:14 - told I need I needed to create this type
435:16 - and if you wonder why I need it so I
435:18 - need this type to specify whether it's a
435:20 - video or a post and of and of course I
435:23 - have created this inside each model of
435:25 - video and also channel so now I can
435:28 - create some conditions to say if the
435:29 - selected item
435:31 - do type this selected item the type if
435:34 - it is equal to a
435:36 - video in this case I want to add that
435:39 - video into the list of found items but
435:42 - if else if the selected item. type is
435:46 - equal to user in this case I'm going to
435:48 - add that user inside that list and for
435:51 - now it has this type uh it gets some
435:54 - error and maybe I should not make it
435:56 - funnel let's see what's wrong
435:59 - here and now the errors are gone and
436:03 - actually I have some typo here I have
436:06 - renamed two lists the same this found
436:09 - items I have here and also I have this
436:11 - found items there so I need to change
436:13 - this actually I'm going to keep this
436:17 - widget data type but I need to rename
436:20 - this I'm not going to call this found
436:21 - items but I can just call it items
436:24 - widget it was just uh some renames that
436:28 - caused this error so I can just call it
436:30 - items
436:31 - wiget so now back to what I said if the
436:34 - selected item the type is equal to a
436:37 - video I want to add that video to the
436:38 - list and if it is uh user I want to add
436:41 - the search user tile widget that I just
436:43 - created now into this list of items
436:46 - widget and let's just do that and also I
436:50 - can create other you know conditions as
436:53 - well that if for example this list is
436:56 - empty what I should happen for example
436:57 - if the list of found items is empty and
437:00 - this case for example I just want to
437:02 - return a size
437:07 - box but for now first of all let's add
437:10 - the video and also the user to the list
437:12 - so first of all I'm going to make this
437:13 - condition that if the selected type if
437:17 - this selected item it's a video all you
437:19 - want to add a post or a video into that
437:22 - list so I can just say in this case the
437:25 - items widget
437:27 - list do I'm going to just say add and
437:30 - then what I'm going to add here is going
437:32 - to be just the post widget that I have
437:34 - created and here I just need to give it
437:36 - the video which in this case going to be
437:38 - just the selected
437:40 - item so now it should be all right
437:43 - whenever it's a video I'm going to just
437:45 - add this post which you know it's the
437:47 - thumbnail and everything of the my video
437:49 - to this list of items widget but if it
437:52 - is a user in this case the list of items
437:55 - widget I will add a search user tile
437:58 - widget search Channel tile so this is
438:02 - what I'm going to add if it is a video
438:04 - for now I can just give it a
438:06 - const okay so let me just explain what I
438:10 - have done here I have a list of items
438:13 - widget of course it's a data type is a
438:14 - widget so it contains widget inside this
438:16 - list the next I have created an index
438:19 - for this final items it means that this
438:21 - selected item is just every single item
438:24 - that I that has been searched it can be
438:26 - a video it can be a user and I have just
438:30 - created this recation that if this item
438:32 - is a video in this case I want to add
438:34 - that video to that list of items wiget
438:37 - but if it is a user in this case I want
438:38 - to add that user to the list of items
438:40 - widget and if it is empty I just want to
438:42 - return a sized
438:44 - box and finally when this all conditions
438:47 - are done I'm going to just return this
438:49 - items
438:51 - widget but at the index number zero so
438:55 - if you wonder why I do need to use this
438:57 - index number zero because it is exactly
438:59 - what I need to do here
439:01 - and every time the list V that Builder
439:03 - rebuild itself it gets a new index and
439:06 - at each time the index number zero which
439:09 - is going to be the first item will
439:10 - appear and when I do that you will see
439:12 - that it's completely working and it's
439:14 - correct so at the end I'm going to just
439:15 - return the first item of this items
439:17 - widget list and that should be
439:19 - perfect now let me just use this method
439:22 - of filter list somewhere and the best
439:24 - place for doing it I believe is going to
439:26 - be just a inside the unchanged property
439:29 - for the text field me just find this
439:31 - text fi here I have an unchanged
439:34 - property and if you wonder when this
439:37 - metod triggers every time that I release
439:39 - a key on the keyboard This whenever you
439:42 - type something inside this text fil or
439:44 - you release a key this unchanged method
439:46 - will be triggered so I believe this is
439:47 - the best place because whenever a new
439:50 - character or a new key is released I
439:52 - want this filter list to be triggered
439:54 - and change the
439:56 - items so let me just use this filter
439:58 - list method here and the keyword
440:00 - selected here is going to be just it can
440:02 - be the value yeah I don't need to use
440:04 - any controller and I'm going to just do
440:06 - it using this value that I have here so
440:09 - this filter list should be a future let
440:12 - me just specify this that the result of
440:15 - this method is going to be just a future
440:16 - of void because I'm not returning
440:18 - anything and also I want to this me make
440:21 - this method a and aoid
440:24 - this so now this should be all right and
440:27 - it should display everything let me just
440:29 - do a hot restart
440:33 - okay so right now if I search for
440:36 - example a as you can see it's working
440:40 - now I can see this this is going to be
440:41 - the first user and also this is going to
440:43 - be the second user and I hope it's
440:46 - perfectly okay actually it's not okay
440:49 - because I haven't give it the actual
440:52 - value inside the search tile widget so
440:55 - for now as you can see this is just a
440:57 - hard C it but it's not an actual value
440:59 - and I need to give it actual value so I
441:02 - need to create that and here I can give
441:05 - it actually a user model because this is
441:07 - what it needs and I'm going to just call
441:09 - it user now let me just generate
441:12 - Constructor
441:13 - here and now I just want to take this
441:16 - user and put it where it needs also I
441:19 - need to put some cons here to remove
441:21 - this blue warnings first of all I need
441:24 - to give it a background image the circle
441:26 - AER and of course I need to display the
441:27 - port picture of the user who is
441:29 - displaying here and for D get just like
441:31 - always I can use a cache Network image
441:33 - provider and here I can just say user.
441:36 - profile
441:38 - picture the next one is going to be just
441:40 - the display name so let me just remove
441:42 - this hardcoded text and then instead I'm
441:44 - going to use user. display name and put
441:47 - accounts here the next one is going to
441:49 - be for the
441:50 - username it's user dot actually
441:54 - username and accounts here the next one
441:58 - is going to be just the number of
441:59 - subscriptions and here I can just say
442:01 - user do subscriptions. T string for now
442:06 - it's going to be all
442:08 - right and everything should be okay now
442:12 - inside this search screen I need to give
442:14 - a value for this search
442:16 - tile um search channel tile and it wants
442:19 - a user which is going to be just the
442:21 - selected item here so I need to just
442:25 - give it the selected item because this
442:27 - is what it takes now let me just do a
442:30 - hard to start and it should be
442:32 - working so if I search here something
442:35 - like a maybe it gives me back yeah this
442:38 - is going to be the channel and also this
442:40 - is the second Channel but I don't know
442:42 - why it's giving me back the same
442:44 - channels it should not be doing like
442:46 - this so we got some errors here and let
442:50 - me just find out what's wrong here
442:53 - actually I had some errors here which I
442:54 - just need to solve right now and first
442:57 - of all is that I have created this
442:59 - provider all channels provider but I
443:01 - haven't used actually the provider for
443:03 - the videos and as you can see I have
443:05 - used here the users any set of videos
443:07 - and I need to do like this videos and
443:10 - now let me just create the provider for
443:13 - the videos as well I mean I have to use
443:15 - this provider as well so this is going
443:17 - to be just a list of video models and
443:20 - I'm going to just call it videos and
443:22 - here I can just use ratch and here I'm
443:25 - going to just use all videos provider
443:29 - and that should be all right
443:31 - and of course I'm going to just await
443:33 - this method as
443:34 - well now I have this videos and instead
443:37 - of working on the display name I need to
443:39 - work under the title in terms of
443:41 - channels I want to I want to search on
443:43 - its display name if the keyboard
443:45 - selected is inside the display name of
443:47 - this specific Channel but in terms of
443:50 - videos I want to check the title if the
443:52 - keyword selected is inside the title of
443:55 - this specific video and now this should
443:58 - be all right and one other mistake that
444:00 - I made inside the list F the Builder I
444:03 - don't need to use else if I just need to
444:05 - use if and again right here I only need
444:07 - to use if instead of lse if because
444:09 - that's going to give give us some
444:11 - error and now everything should be just
444:14 - okay let me just do a hot rest
444:17 - start and now if I search for example
444:20 - for
444:21 - a as you can see I get one channel
444:24 - called Ahmed amini and also I get this
444:27 - video first video on the platform for
444:30 - example if I add H you can see the video
444:34 - disappears but I still I can get this
444:36 - video so everything is working perfectly
444:38 - fine so now that we are completely done
444:40 - with a search feature and as you can see
444:42 - I can search any user in video for
444:44 - example I search ah and as you can see
444:46 - all the channels or videos related to
444:48 - the my search will appear on this list
444:50 - for example right now I'm getting this
444:52 - Channel ahmar amini and for example
444:54 - right now we have arol M and all these
444:57 - channels and also videos so the search
444:59 - feature is completely work working
445:00 - perfect but now I want to just go one
445:03 - step further and what I want to do is
445:05 - whenever I click on a channel for
445:07 - example this mik acman I want to be
445:09 - navigated to this profile so when I
445:11 - click on mikar acan I should go to the
445:14 - Mikasa AC's profile and as you know I
445:17 - have already created this user Channel
445:19 - page and up to now I only have the UI
445:22 - but now I want to give it the actual
445:24 - value first of all I need to convert
445:26 - this status widget into a stateful
445:28 - widget and then I can just create a user
445:30 - ID so I'm going to just create this
445:33 - string user ID and using this user ID I
445:35 - can get the actual user of that a
445:38 - specific channel so I'm going to just
445:40 - generate Constructor for
445:42 - it and also let me just put a cons here
445:45 - to remove this blue warning so right now
445:47 - everything is perfect and I can just use
445:49 - a provider called each user data
445:51 - provider which I already have created
445:52 - inside the out feature and of course you
445:55 - should be familiar with this and using
445:56 - this any user data provider I can get
445:59 - the data of the channel which I have
446:02 - clicked on so let me just uh come here
446:04 - and here I just want to create a
446:07 - consumer widget and I can just get all
446:09 - the data using that so let me just copy
446:11 - this uh column I'm going to take this
446:13 - whole column and cut that make sure to
446:16 - just cut this column and here I can just
446:19 - create a consumer
446:21 - widget here I have a builder and here I
446:25 - can just use this ri. watch and here the
446:28 - method I want to use is that any user
446:31 - data provider and of course here I need
446:32 - to have a user ID which I can just say
446:35 - widget. user ID and it is the user ID
446:37 - that we get from the parameter and here
446:40 - we have this when that it can of course
446:43 - you're just familiar with this uh we can
446:44 - handle different conditions whether we
446:46 - have the data whether we have the error
446:48 - or loading first of all if we got the
446:50 - actual data I just want to return
446:53 - everything that I have and the next of
446:55 - course if you got any error I just want
446:56 - to return the error page and if you got
447:00 - uh if the data is loading I just want to
447:03 - uh show the loader pitch so that's all
447:08 - right now let me just show the actual
447:10 - value because using this any user data
447:13 - provider result of this method is going
447:15 - to be a user of course type is user
447:18 - model if you wonder which user is this
447:20 - it's based on the user ID that we give
447:23 - and right now that I have this user ID I
447:25 - need to go to the search screen and what
447:28 - I want to do is whenever I click on a
447:29 - channel so let me just come to this
447:32 - search channel tile and I want to just
447:35 - wrap the whole thing with a G
447:39 - detector and into the onp property I
447:42 - just want to I just want to make sure
447:43 - that when someone click on this specific
447:45 - Channel they should be navigated to that
447:48 - profile so I'm going to just create a
447:50 - navigation
447:52 - here and here I'm going to just return
447:54 - this user Channel page and of course as
447:58 - you can see it takes and it wants a user
448:01 - ID and the user ID is going to be just
448:03 - this user. user ID the one that we are
448:07 - getting from the parameter so everything
448:09 - should be all right now let me just get
448:11 - back to this user Channel page and here
448:14 - I just need to fill out all the data so
448:17 - first of all I need to give it a
448:20 - background image of course it's going to
448:21 - be the perfect picture so I'm going to
448:23 - just use once again the cach network
448:24 - image just like we always
448:26 - use and the URL is going to be just this
448:30 - data I'm going to just call this user
448:32 - because it is any user that uh we have
448:34 - clicked on and the profile picture is
448:36 - going to be just user do profile P now
448:40 - let me just remove this
448:41 - const and that should be all right the
448:44 - next let me also fill out the display
448:46 - name and it's of course just user.
448:48 - display name and again remove the const
448:51 - and put it here the next one is going to
448:53 - be the username and again that's going
448:55 - to be just user do
448:58 - username and remove the and put it here
449:01 - so I'm going to just do that for all of
449:03 - them and for example the number of
449:04 - subscriptions and instead of this no
449:07 - subscriptions I want to give it the
449:08 - actual value of number of subscriptions
449:11 - here so what I can use here is it should
449:14 - be user actually let me just put it
449:18 - inside the string and here I'm going to
449:20 - just say the value of it is equal to
449:22 - user do
449:24 - subscriptions.
449:26 - length and I just need to remove this
449:28 - cons and this should be all
449:30 - right and right now we are just getting
449:33 - the user. subscriptions. L and here I'm
449:35 - going to just say
449:38 - subscriptions and of course I'm going to
449:40 - just do the same for the number of
449:42 - videos as well so let me just copy that
449:44 - and paste it here and in instead of
449:46 - subscriptions I'm going to just say
449:48 - videos but it does it doesn't need a
449:50 - link because number of videos is an
449:52 - integer inside my model it's not a list
449:55 - so that should be all right and also let
449:57 - me just have some distance here and that
450:00 - should be all right so right now we're
450:03 - done here and of course I don't want to
450:05 - have this Boolean as I said before this
450:07 - Boolean was just temporary because I
450:09 - didn't have the actual value I just
450:10 - created this but now that I have I don't
450:13 - need this bullion anymore and I can just
450:15 - use the actual value of the videos and
450:19 - actually I need a new whole provider to
450:21 - show the value so let me just uh go back
450:25 - to show
450:26 - that this Boolean for now this should be
450:29 - all right but later on I'm going to just
450:31 - change it before that I will show you
450:33 - how this channel this page is going to
450:35 - look like so that should be all right
450:37 - also let me just return this one so now
450:40 - it should be good and let me just check
450:41 - it to you whether it's working or not
450:43 - and if it was working I will work on the
450:45 - videos as well so now when I click on
450:48 - this rmen arlet for example when I click
450:51 - on it as you can see I navigated to this
450:54 - arm in arlet profile this is the display
450:56 - name this is the profile picture
450:58 - username number of subscription and also
451:00 - a number of videos so this should be
451:02 - videos let me just change it real
451:04 - quick this is going to be number of
451:08 - videos and of course it says that for
451:10 - now it has no video so I'm going to just
451:12 - change right now so it's working as you
451:14 - can see we get the data of this specific
451:16 - Channel but now let me just show the
451:19 - videos of this specific channel so how
451:22 - can we do that as I already told you uh
451:25 - I'm not going to use this uh Boolean
451:27 - because it was just temporarily but now
451:29 - I want to use the actual value to see if
451:33 - we have videos or we don't have any
451:35 - video actually I need to create a new
451:37 - provider as I already told you so let me
451:39 - just create that one as
451:41 - well and I can create this provider
451:43 - anywhere I want for example I can create
451:46 - that right here so I'm going to just say
451:49 - this is for the provider and here I'm
451:51 - going to just create channel
451:56 - provider so here let me just create this
452:00 - I'm going to just uh call this provider
452:04 - something like each Channel videos
452:07 - provider because I want to get all the
452:11 - videos of a specific Channel using this
452:13 - provider so this should be all right and
452:16 - of course I'm going to just use a simple
452:17 - provider just like always and let's see
452:20 - how we can just create that one here I
452:22 - need to go first of all inside the
452:26 - collection of videos but actually I
452:27 - remember I don't want to use this provid
452:30 - I actually need to use a future provider
452:32 - because for need to get the value I need
452:34 - to use the VIN method again and that
452:36 - should be the perfect provider and
452:37 - instead of a simple provider I can use
452:39 - the feuture provider or I also can use
452:41 - the stream provider but here the feuture
452:43 - provider is perfect so here I need to go
452:48 - inside the collection of videos because
452:49 - I want to get all the videos of a
452:51 - specific channel so I need to go inside
452:54 - the video collection so let me just go
452:56 - first of all uh Into the Fire firer
452:59 - inance so I just need to create an
453:01 - inance of this Firebase fire store and
453:03 - then I can go inside the collection of
453:05 - videos and then here I just want to
453:08 - create a condition to say if the user ID
453:11 - because as you know I have a field
453:13 - inside a video collection called user ID
453:16 - and then I'm going to say if the user ID
453:19 - inside that video is equal to the user
453:23 - ID that I want to take from the
453:25 - parameters so I need to add this user ID
453:28 - as parameter and here of course this
453:30 - feature provider is not going to be just
453:32 - a feature provider not a simple feature
453:34 - provider but I'm going to just use the
453:36 - keyword family and now that should be
453:38 - all
453:40 - right so now I'm going to just say uh I
453:43 - create an inance of Firebase fire then I
453:46 - go inside the collection of videos and
453:48 - where the user ID is equal to this user
453:50 - ID that I take from the parameter in
453:52 - this case I want to get everything from
453:54 - this collection so now I need to store
453:58 - this inside a variable called videos
454:01 - map and now I got all these videos and
454:05 - now what I want to do is to just convert
454:08 - this list of videos into user model into
454:11 - video model actually so I can just say
454:14 - videos map and then I can use a method
454:16 - called first of all I need to go inside
454:18 - the docks of course uh I need to make
454:20 - this aist because of course it's a
454:22 - future provider I need to make this iniz
454:25 - and now it should be working perfectly
454:28 - so now inside this video map I can go
454:30 - into the docs and now I have all the
454:33 - videos and I can just call it
454:36 - videos okay I'm going to just call this
454:39 - videos and then I can go into the videos
454:42 - and then do the map and map means I can
454:45 - get each of this video and then I want
454:48 - to convert them into a video model so I
454:51 - can just say video model and then I will
454:54 - use the from map and the map is going to
454:56 - be just a video. data and finally at the
455:00 - end I'm going to just convert everything
455:02 - into a list and here this is going to be
455:05 - a list of video model so let me just so
455:08 - when I convert everything into a list I
455:10 - get this videos back and here I need to
455:14 - call this one so I'm going to just say
455:17 - final list of video model and I can just
455:21 - call it
455:23 - video models and that should be all
455:26 - right so now I have this video models
455:27 - and I can just return this video
455:31 - models okay perfect now I have this
455:34 - video models and this videos are going
455:36 - to be the videos of a specific Channel
455:39 - because everything is in this condition
455:41 - that I have created because I'm saying
455:44 - only on only and only I want the videos
455:47 - which the user ID is equal to the user
455:50 - ID that I take from the parameter so now
455:52 - that I have created this provider I can
455:55 - actually just go back to this user
455:56 - Channel page and here I can actually
455:58 - show the videos of this specific user
456:01 - and for doing it as you can see in this
456:03 - pitch I already have this first consumer
456:05 - bdet and using this consumer Viet I just
456:08 - get the user data of this specific user
456:11 - but I need to actually create a second
456:14 - consumer vget so let me just take this
456:15 - first one I'm going to just uh take the
456:19 - first consumer widget and I will just
456:21 - take it out and first of all I want to
456:24 - have a column inside this column I can
456:26 - have this consumer widget and and also
456:30 - right here after the first consumer vet
456:32 - I want to create another one so let me
456:34 - just write a comment here to say second
456:37 - consumer
456:39 - viget and using the second consumer
456:41 - vidget I can actually show all the
456:43 - videos of this specific user that we are
456:45 - in in the channel right now so I'm going
456:48 - to just create this uh consumer vidget
456:51 - and it has a
456:55 - builder now I can actually use this riat
456:59 - and the provider here is going to be
457:00 - just each Channel videos provider and I
457:04 - have to just uh initialize this user ID
457:07 - here which is going to be widget. user
457:09 - ID and now I can actually use this win
457:12 - method and now I can have uh based on
457:16 - different scenarios I can actually
457:17 - handle the data when I have this data
457:20 - when I have an error or when the data is
457:22 - loading so you're already familiar with
457:23 - this stuff so it should not be hard for
457:25 - you if the data is loading I'm going to
457:27 - just return a loader just like always
457:31 - when we got an error I'm going to just
457:33 - return this error
457:36 - page and when we have the actual data in
457:40 - this case what I want to return is uh
457:43 - let me just show it to you I have this
457:45 - right here let me just take this padding
457:47 - up to right here I'm going to just
457:50 - delete the rest of it I don't need it
457:51 - for now and I can actually show this
457:55 - inside the data so this should be good
457:58 - let me just put a semicolon here and
458:01 - everything must be good let me just see
458:02 - where is this error actually I need to
458:05 - return
458:06 - this and now everything should be good
458:09 - so basically I just want to display all
458:12 - the videos inside the second consumer
458:14 - widget so inside uh this column I have
458:16 - two consumer vets let me just uh uh walk
458:19 - you through it so what we have done
458:21 - inside this file I have a column inside
458:23 - that I have two consumer widgets inside
458:26 - the first consumer widget I just want to
458:28 - display all the user data like profile
458:30 - picture display name and everything and
458:33 - inside the second consumer vget I want
458:34 - to display the videos of that specific
458:37 - channel that we are in and we are
458:39 - clicked inside it so this data is going
458:42 - to be just the videos all the videos
458:44 - inside this Channel and actually I can
458:46 - just display all of them using a grid
458:48 - view. Builder it's a pre-built widget
458:50 - that we have inside the flut
458:52 - SDK and actually I don't need this no
458:55 - video uh and I can just take it out and
458:58 - instead of the that I can display it
459:01 - using a grid view. Builder so now inside
459:04 - this grid view. Builder we have to
459:06 - required parameters this grid delegate
459:08 - and also the item Builder the first
459:10 - parameter of grid delegate is just
459:12 - something uh related to the UI so this
459:14 - is going to be uh what I use here the
459:17 - cross AIS count of two the cross AIS
459:19 - spacing of it and also the main AIS
459:21 - spacing of it this is something uh
459:23 - related to the UI and also I have this
459:26 - item Builder here and inside item
459:29 - Builder I can actually display the
459:31 - videos using this uh provider that I
459:34 - have just created so let me just do that
459:37 - real quick and what I can do is actually
459:40 - say if I want to just create a condition
459:43 - here to say if the videos is not empty
459:46 - in this case I want to just return a
459:49 - post here and the video here is going to
459:51 - be just videos index so that should be
459:55 - the video all the videos inside this
459:58 - specific Channel let me just reformat
460:00 - The Code by putting some comment here
460:02 - and now I think I can actually run the
460:05 - project to see if it's working or not
460:07 - and here I also need uh the item count
460:10 - property which it just it just tells us
460:12 - how many videos do we have here and the
460:16 - and it's going to be just something like
460:17 - videos. link so that should be
460:21 - good and here uh it just needs to return
460:25 - something here and I've I've just said
460:27 - here that if the videos is not empty so
460:30 - if we have some videos here I just want
460:31 - to return this post and in other cases
460:34 - I'm going to just return a size box
460:36 - means
460:38 - nothing so now this should be good and
460:41 - let me just uh run the emulator and also
460:43 - the project to see how does it look like
460:45 - and if it's working or not and also
460:48 - before running the emulator let me also
460:51 - uh do something here I actually want to
460:53 - take a I want to wrap this gv. Builder I
460:57 - can wrap it with a size box and I will
461:00 - just give it a height of something like
461:01 - 80 I hope that is the perfect size for
461:04 - this great V do Builder and now I think
461:07 - everything should be good so let me just
461:09 - run the
461:19 - project good the project is run and let
461:22 - me just test it out if I search your ah
461:25 - it should bring all the searches and all
461:27 - the results here and when I click on the
461:29 - second one Ahmed amini so this is the
461:32 - videos of this user this is the data and
461:35 - also this is going to be the videos and
461:38 - it should be working fine and this
461:40 - should be good now let me also do
461:42 - something else here and inside the first
461:45 - consumer vet I want to display uh some
461:48 - text so let me just uh create them first
461:50 - that you can understand what I mean I
461:52 - want to create a condition here so I'm
461:54 - going to just say user. videos do is
461:59 - empty or I can just say if the user.
462:01 - videos is equal to zero it means that
462:04 - the user has no video in this case I can
462:08 - actually display a t to say no video
462:12 - this user doesn't have any
462:14 - video but if the user has any video I
462:18 - just want to display a text to say this
462:20 - specific user I want to have the display
462:23 - name of this user so I'm going to just
462:24 - say user do display name and I'm going
462:28 - to just say here videos so this should
462:32 - be good let me just put a cons here and
462:35 - I also want to wrap this text with a
462:37 - center
462:42 - widget and what actually I'm doing here
462:44 - is to have a condition to say if this
462:47 - specific Channel doesn't have any video
462:49 - I just want to display a text to say no
462:51 - video but if it has any videos all you
462:54 - want to say okay the videos of this
462:57 - specific user I just want to display
463:00 - them and in the second consumer vet I
463:02 - can actually show the videos but in this
463:05 - uh part I just want to say okay uh this
463:07 - is going to be the videos of this user
463:10 - and let me just take this and I need to
463:12 - display it after this flat button not
463:14 - before it so let me just put it after
463:16 - this flat button and now it should be
463:18 - good let me just check it out if it's
463:20 - looking good or not and as you can see
463:22 - this is the text that I have created it
463:24 - looks like this Ahmed Amin's videos it's
463:27 - good I just need to uh change the text
463:30 - style of this and also its position so
463:33 - first of all let me just change the
463:34 - styling of this
463:36 - text the text style here I'm going to
463:39 - just change the font size to something
463:41 - like 23 and also I will give it a font
463:44 - way of
463:45 - Bol and this should be good about the
463:48 - text style let me also change its
463:51 - position by giving it a padding so I
463:54 - will just wrap this text with a padding
464:00 - and I will give it a padding from the
464:02 - left side a padding of 10 and also from
464:04 - the top side a padding of like for in
464:06 - and I hope this looks good so it looks
464:09 - like this videos and these are going to
464:12 - be the videos and when I click actually
464:14 - on this videos it will be navigated to
464:16 - that a specific video so everything is
464:20 - perfectly working great and these are
464:22 - the videos and actually I just want to
464:24 - display the thumbnails not all this
464:26 - information inside that post like we
464:28 - also have have the display name we have
464:31 - the dead population we have a lot of
464:32 - things inside this post but I just want
464:34 - to see the thumbnails of this videos and
464:37 - when the user clicks on them they should
464:39 - be navigated to that specific video and
464:42 - I also uh let me just change the text
464:45 - sty for this one I will give it a style
464:48 - and again I want to give it the same
464:50 - text style that I have for this one so
464:53 - let me just copy this and paste it right
464:55 - there F size of 23 and also F we of Bolt
464:59 - that when we don't have any video it
465:00 - should display a text to the user that
465:02 - there's no video inside this channel so
465:05 - this channel has not uploaded any video
465:07 - and now it should be great so this part
465:10 - is great and now I can display the
465:12 - videos of other users other channels but
465:15 - I also want to display videos of my own
465:19 - channel so how can I do it let me just
465:21 - open that my channel and inside my
465:25 - channel screen I also want to display my
465:27 - videos let me just put some cont
465:30 - here where should I actually put this
465:33 - videos actually when I click on my
465:36 - profile right here so this is inside the
465:38 - account page and when I click right on
465:40 - my profile I want to be navigated to
465:42 - this my channel page so let me just
465:44 - create this one as well uh inside the
465:47 - account page when I click on my own
465:50 - profile which is going to be just this
465:51 - row I think this row contains all this
465:54 - stuff or it should be this column yeah
465:57 - uh I'm going to just wrap this column
465:58 - with with gesture
466:00 - detector and in the on property I'm
466:03 - going to just make this that whenever
466:04 - someone clicks on this profile this
466:07 - column they should be navigated to this
466:09 - my channel page so I'm going to just
466:11 - create a navigation here and I'm going
466:14 - to just return my channel screen so this
466:18 - should be good let me just put some
466:20 - commas here to reformat the code and now
466:22 - when I actually click on my profile I
466:25 - should be navigated to this my channel
466:28 - page and that is is great so this page
466:31 - is already made and I just want to
466:32 - display my videos inside this page as
466:36 - well uh let me just go into through this
466:38 - my channel page and where I actually uh
466:41 - where I can actually put my videos it
466:44 - should be inside this top pages and
466:47 - actually I can create a whole maybe a
466:50 - whole new page for that because for now
466:52 - as you can see we are only showing some
466:55 - pages uh some vide like text Home Videos
466:58 - short community playlist Channel about
467:00 - but I don't want to have this and
467:02 - basically instead of it I want to have
467:04 - some actual pages so instead of this uh
467:08 - home the first one I want to have an
467:11 - actual page to display my videos inside
467:14 - that and inside my channel the parts I
467:18 - can actually have or maybe inside the
467:20 - pages yeah here I can have home page I
467:25 - can say home Channel page let me just UT
467:29 - the material. dart create an inad this
467:32 - fidget and I'm going to just call it
467:34 - home Channel page so that should be all
467:38 - right and right here I'm going to just
467:40 - create an
467:41 - scaffold maybe it's necessary or maybe
467:43 - not maybe I remove it uh so let's see
467:46 - how it does it look like and inside the
467:49 - body I can actually show all the videos
467:52 - so I can just copy everything from the
467:55 - previous example inside the user Channel
467:57 - page I have a second consumer
468:00 - wiget and I am sure that I can use the
468:03 - second consumer fdet to display all my
468:05 - videos inside my channel as well let me
468:09 - just take this I'm going to just copy
468:12 - and paste it right here of course I'm
468:15 - going to need a lot of things here first
468:16 - of all let me just import this post the
468:19 - error page and also the
468:25 - loader and basically I can also import
468:28 - this one
468:29 - and this FL River pod actually what I
468:33 - really need here is a user ID and the
468:35 - user ID here is going to be just the
468:37 - current user ID so I can just create an
468:39 - incense of Firebase
468:41 - OD and then the current user and the U
468:44 - ID because the user ID of this one is
468:47 - going to be my own user ID because we
468:49 - are working on my own channel page and
468:52 - all the videos of this one is going to
468:54 - be all the videos when the user ID is my
468:57 - own user ID that I'm currently signed in
469:00 - with uh let me just see what is the
469:02 - error right now and let me just remove
469:04 - this and this should be
469:07 - good so now let's do a hard rest start
469:10 - and before that let me just put that
469:11 - page right here this home Channel page
469:15 - and let's see if it's working or not and
469:18 - actually as you know I don't have any
469:20 - video inside this uh account I haven't
469:23 - uploaded any video with this account so
469:26 - I can also make a condition here I just
469:28 - remembered I can make a condition that
469:30 - do we have any video inside this page or
469:32 - not if we have video we are going to
469:34 - just display the videos but if we don't
469:36 - have any video I can just display a text
469:38 - to say no video inside this collection I
469:41 - don't know if there is any way to do it
469:43 - actually of course it is we have this
469:45 - videos and I'm going to just create the
469:48 - condition right here to say if the
469:51 - videos. length is equal to zero this
469:54 - means that we don't have any video which
469:56 - in this case I'm going to just uh return
469:58 - a text to say no
470:01 - video but if it is not the case it means
470:03 - we have video and in that case I'm going
470:06 - to just display all the videos we
470:09 - have let me just wrap this one with a
470:11 - center widget and put a cons right here
470:15 - and also I'm going to just change the
470:17 - text style for this text and I'm going
470:19 - to just give it a font size of 23 and a
470:23 - f Way of both so let me just create that
470:25 - the font size is going to be 23
470:29 - and the f Way is going to be just a f
470:31 - Way of Bol everything should be perfect
470:33 - now and as you can see I get this no
470:36 - video because we don't have any video
470:38 - inside this channel so I haven't
470:40 - uploaded any from this Channel and now
470:43 - everything should be good and we are
470:45 - able to see the videos of my own channel
470:48 - and also other users Channel now that we
470:51 - are almost at the end of this tutorial I
470:53 - want to just make the UI and also the ux
470:55 - in some of the pages look a little
470:57 - better so so I'm going to just uh work
470:59 - on the UI first of all let me open this
471:02 - account page and as you can see this is
471:05 - the UI for the account page and it's
471:07 - really not looking very nice so let me
471:09 - just change some of this stuff
471:10 - here first of all I can remove
471:13 - temporarily this icon button and also I
471:16 - can just take out this circle aor and
471:19 - put it inside this row this is the
471:21 - perfect place for the circle aatar and
471:23 - this is what we got up to now I also
471:26 - want to wrap this row with a padding so
471:32 - I will give it a padding from the left
471:34 - side a padding of 20 and also I uh I can
471:37 - give it a padding from the top side and
471:40 - this is what we get up to here and also
471:43 - I want to bring this username to the
471:45 - start of this column so I think I can
471:48 - just uh give this uh column a cross axis
471:51 - alignment and this should be a
471:55 - start that is good and and also after
471:59 - the username I want to have a text here
472:01 - so let me just have a text here to say
472:03 - manage
472:05 - your Google account and this one I
472:09 - wanted to change the text style
472:12 - so I will give it first of all a color
472:15 - of
472:16 - blue and maybe a f Way of
472:22 - w500 yeah this is what I got here now
472:25 - let me also change the username I just
472:27 - want to give it an add signed at the
472:29 - beginning this is the username let me
472:30 - just take this and I'm going to just do
472:34 - like this and here just before it I
472:37 - wanted to have an add sign now it looks
472:39 - like add sign text so whatever the
472:40 - username is I want it to be add signed
472:43 - that
472:44 - username so that should be good and now
472:48 - let me just give it a padding from this
472:50 - to bottom side as well to this row so
472:53 - I'm going to just give a padding to this
472:55 - row only from the bottom side and I will
472:58 - give it a padding of ter so I wanted to
472:59 - have a great distance
473:02 - here and this is what we get actually
473:05 - now let me also give a padding to this
473:07 - items as well and I will give it a
473:09 - padding of maybe 20 so I'm going to just
473:12 - wrap this items with a
473:16 - padding and I will give it a padding
473:19 - from the left side and it should be a
473:20 - padding of 20 this should be good and
473:24 - this is what we get and also after this
473:27 - items I also want to add another text
473:29 - that we actually have in YouTube so I'm
473:31 - going to just add a text to say privacy
473:36 - policy dot terms of
473:41 - services and let me also change the
473:44 - style for this text I will give it a
473:46 - color of blue
473:48 - gray a font size of
473:53 - 1.5 and also a way of w500
474:01 - let me just put some cons here to remove
474:03 - this blue warnings and this should be
474:05 - good and actually this is what we got up
474:08 - to here and before that I just need to
474:09 - have a spacer and also I need to wrap
474:12 - this text with a padding to give it a
474:14 - padding from the bottom
474:17 - side and it should be pading of 12 that
474:21 - is great now this is what I got up to
474:24 - here I have this uh information at the
474:27 - top side then I have this items and then
474:30 - I have this text also let me just give
474:32 - it a distance between this profile
474:34 - picture and this information so let me
474:37 - just create a size box between these two
474:40 - after the circle aor I can have a size
474:43 - box with a weight of like maybe
474:47 - five and this is what we get up to now
474:51 - so this is going to be our account page
474:52 - and right now it looks much better than
474:54 - the previous one and also I can actually
474:57 - remove the font wave for for this manage
474:59 - your Google account text let me just
475:01 - remove this phone
475:04 - to and this should be better so this is
475:07 - going to be the final one and when I
475:09 - click on it I navigated to this my
475:12 - screen page and everything is great so
475:15 - now I also want to work and improve the
475:17 - UI of the search screen as well the
475:19 - screen that right now I'm in and
475:22 - basically I can just change this text
475:23 - field and make it more beautiful and
475:26 - fancy so let me just open this sech
475:29 - screen and right here let me find the
475:32 - text field so here I'm going to just uh
475:35 - make this text field look a little more
475:37 - beautiful and for doing it I can do a
475:39 - lot of stuff here first I just need to
475:42 - change the color to gray color with a
475:45 - shade of 200 let me just remove this
475:48 - const and everything should be
475:51 - good and also I want to add a border
475:54 - radius to this uh border so I'm going to
475:57 - add a border radius here a border radius
475:59 - from the all sides it should be circular
476:02 - and I will give it a border radius of 18
476:05 - I want this uh text F to have border
476:08 - radius as well and now I can just copy
476:10 - everything from this border and I'm
476:13 - creating some more border like Focus
476:15 - border also enabled border so I'm going
476:20 - to just copy the to this ones as well
476:23 - and the fil property will be true
476:27 - because I want this text field to have
476:29 - color so this is going to be the color
476:31 - of this text field and also the content
476:34 - padding I want it to have some padding
476:37 - from the top side uh I mean from the
476:39 - left side a padding of Daring and also
476:41 - from the bottom side a padding of 12 so
476:44 - I want it to be the padding and also let
476:46 - me put some commas here to reformat the
476:49 - code and I also want to change the hand
476:52 - style for this text field so I'm going
476:55 - to just give it a text Style
476:59 - and here I can change the font size to
477:01 - like 4 in and also the font weight to
477:06 - w500 now this should be good let me see
477:10 - it right here and this is what we got up
477:11 - to now let me also change the width of
477:15 - this to something like uh
477:18 - 295 actually it's a lot so let me just
477:21 - give it something like
477:23 - 280 or maybe it should be
477:27 - 275 and and also basically I also want
477:30 - to change this uh icon at the end as
477:33 - well so let me just find that the search
477:35 - button I want it to have a BD of
477:37 - something like 50 I want it to be a
477:40 - little smaller actually something like
477:43 - 53 should be good and I also want to
477:46 - increase the height to 43 or I should
477:49 - make it 55 I think that looks
477:52 - good and I also want to change the
477:56 - height of the size box to something like
477:58 - 43 I want it to be a little smaller and
478:01 - now I want to change this WID to
478:05 - 279 and I think that looks great and I
478:09 - also want to change the color of this
478:11 - one as well so I will change the color
478:14 - of this Arrow back to something like
478:16 - gray with a shade of 600 or
478:21 - 700 and let me just remove this cons and
478:24 - everything should be good so this is the
478:26 - new UI of this text f and I think it
478:28 - looks much beautiful now about the UI
478:31 - and the user experience inside this
478:33 - project I want to give you a final
478:35 - homework for the entire project I just
478:37 - want you to fix all the remaining stuff
478:40 - inside different files and different
478:43 - pages for example inside my home Channel
478:45 - as you can see I have zero subscriptions
478:48 - and zero videos so I want to make this
478:50 - condition that whenever we have no
478:52 - subscription it should be like no
478:55 - subscription and when we got no videos
478:57 - it means it's zero videos we should have
478:59 - a text to say no
479:01 - video so something like that I want you
479:04 - to do all this stuff inside different
479:06 - files and pages and just fix all this
479:09 - box this small box and this is going to
479:12 - be your final homework inside different
479:15 - files and different pages I have some
479:17 - hardcoded dat publish as well so I
479:19 - haven't had uh the actual value so I
479:23 - want you to give them the actual value
479:25 - and also use the time ago package to
479:27 - create an accurate uh de publish for all
479:30 - them so this is going to be your final
479:31 - homework to just solve all this small
479:33 - box inside different files and different
479:36 - pages and now I'm going to just work on
479:39 - the last feature here and it's to have
479:42 - the subscription The View and also the
479:44 - like feature actually before that let me
479:47 - just work on one other feature and it's
479:49 - going to be the feature of first comment
479:52 - in every video so when I open a video in
479:55 - this box right here all you want to have
479:57 - the First Command displayed and for
480:00 - doing it I need to create this feature
480:03 - inside this uh as you can see here I
480:05 - have this commment box and right here I
480:07 - have this container and inside this
480:10 - container in the child property I want
480:12 - to create a consumer widget inside which
480:14 - I can just display the first comment in
480:17 - every video so I'm going to just create
480:19 - a consumer widget
480:22 - here and inside the Builder I can
480:25 - actually create this functionality and
480:28 - actually before that for displaying the
480:31 - comment and the first comment inside
480:33 - this video I need to have a comment
480:35 - provider so uh inside the content here
480:39 - inside the comment folder I can create
480:42 - uh a comment
480:43 - provider and inside this provider that
480:46 - I'm going to just create right now I
480:47 - will be able to get all the comments and
480:49 - later on I can display the first comment
480:51 - inside that box in the video so I'm
480:55 - going to just call this uh comments
480:57 - provider
480:58 - and it will be equal to just a simple
481:00 - provider and here I can do everything
481:04 - right here so here first of all I'm
481:06 - going to just create an inance of
481:08 - Firebase fire store and then I'm going
481:11 - to go inside the collection of comments
481:14 - and here which comments do I want to get
481:16 - I need to use this where method to get a
481:19 - specific comments because I just don't
481:20 - want to get all the comments inside this
481:22 - collection because there are a lot of
481:24 - comments I just want to get every
481:26 - comments in every single video so I just
481:30 - want to do this and for doing it I need
481:32 - to say I just want to get all the
481:34 - comments where the video ID is equal to
481:38 - the video ID which I'm going to just
481:40 - take as parameter here maybe I should
481:43 - not create a simple provider or I should
481:47 - have of course I need to have a future
481:49 - provider not a simple provider so I'm
481:51 - going to create this feature provider
481:53 - and it's not a simple feature provider
481:55 - it is a feature provider. family because
481:58 - I want to have a parameter here which is
482:00 - going to be the video ID and let me just
482:02 - explain to you once again that what I'm
482:04 - doing here I don't want to get all the
482:06 - comments I'm going inside the collection
482:08 - of comments and then I'm saying okay uh
482:10 - inside this collection I want to take
482:12 - all the comments where the video ID is
482:14 - equal to the this video ID that I have
482:17 - and of course I will initialize this
482:18 - video ID right inside the video file and
482:21 - finally I'm going to just get all this
482:25 - comments let me just make this method as
482:28 - this and also await
482:30 - this and right now I get the result of
482:33 - this should be something like comments
482:36 - map but actually I don't need map and I
482:38 - just want to convert them into a comment
482:41 - model so for doing it I can just take
482:43 - this comments map and then I go through
482:46 - all the docks inside this comment map
482:49 - and then I can use the map method which
482:51 - give me access to all comments every
482:54 - single comment inside this list and then
482:57 - I can con conver them into a comment
482:59 - model so I'm going to just say comment
483:01 - model. from map and the map here is
483:04 - going to be comment do data of course
483:06 - you should be familiar with this because
483:08 - we have done it a lot of times and
483:10 - finally I'm going to just convert
483:12 - everything back to a list and of course
483:14 - the result of this is going to be a list
483:16 - of comment models first of all let me
483:18 - just put some comments here to refactor
483:20 - the code and here I'm going to just
483:22 - specify that the result of this all of
483:25 - them are going to be a list of comment
483:28 - model which I can just call it
483:32 - comments and finally I just want to
483:34 - return this comments from this provider
483:38 - so this is going to be the provider I
483:40 - have this feature provider that family
483:42 - which returns a comments and of course
483:44 - it takes as a parameter this video ID
483:47 - now I can just get back to the video
483:49 - inside this consumer widget I can use
483:52 - the Riff to say riff doat and now I use
483:55 - this comments provider first let me just
483:58 - import it and I also need to initialize
484:00 - the parameter which is going to be the
484:02 - video ID I believe I can just say vget
484:05 - do video. video ID and now the result of
484:09 - this should be a list of video models
484:12 - but it's an async value so you should be
484:14 - already familiar that the result of this
484:16 - provider is not going to be just a
484:17 - simple list of comment moduls and it's
484:20 - going to be actually Asing value so I'm
484:22 - going to just say the result of this is
484:24 - going to be async value of a list of
484:27 - comment models and I can just call it
484:30 - comments and now I actually can use this
484:33 - comments to display the first comment
484:36 - here and here I'm going to just create a
484:39 - condition first and I will just say if
484:41 - the comments this is going to be a list
484:43 - is empty so uh yeah first of all I
484:46 - should say comments. value now I have
484:48 - the list and I'm going to just say if it
484:50 - is empty in this case I'm going to just
484:52 - return a simple size box let me just put
484:55 - an exclamation mark here and now it
484:57 - should be good but if it is not empty in
485:00 - this case I'm going to just return a
485:02 - vget that I have already created and
485:04 - it's called the video first comment in
485:07 - this case I'm going to just return this
485:10 - video first comment and it is a vet that
485:13 - I have already created inside the
485:14 - starting project you can access this
485:16 - widget let me just uh go inside it and
485:19 - here you can only see a column inside B
485:21 - I have two rows the first row says this
485:24 - text comment and also it has a number of
485:27 - comments that we have inside this video
485:30 - and in the second row I have a circle
485:31 - aor inside which I show the guy who just
485:34 - uh posted that comment and also I have
485:37 - the actual comment the actual first
485:39 - comment on that video so here I need to
485:42 - create a parameter and it's going to be
485:44 - a comment model because I want to
485:46 - display that first comment and I can
485:48 - just call it first comment actually I'm
485:51 - going to just call this first comment
485:52 - let me also import this comment model
485:55 - and also generate Constructor
485:58 - now I have to initialize it inside this
486:01 - video and it asks me for a first comment
486:04 - and this first comments is going to be
486:06 - just the comments in index number zero
486:09 - so this is going to be the first comment
486:12 - actually first of all once again I need
486:14 - to use this value and then I can get the
486:16 - first comment here now it should be good
486:19 - let me just get back to this video first
486:21 - comment and I have to just initialize
486:22 - this first comment here we have the
486:25 - numbers and here I can just say first
486:28 - comment actually maybe instead of this
486:31 - first comment I should just get the
486:33 - whole comments yeah I think that's a
486:35 - better idea because as you can see here
486:38 - I also want to display the number of
486:40 - comments that we have inside this video
486:42 - so for ding get I need to have the whole
486:44 - comments not only the first comments so
486:45 - let me just change it back to the
486:47 - comments and this should be actually a
486:49 - list of comments a list of comment
486:53 - models and instead of first comment I
486:55 - can have the comments and here I can
486:57 - just say I want to just uh initialize
486:59 - the whole comments not only the first
487:02 - comment and here I need to change it to
487:04 - comments now everything should be good
487:07 - and I'm going to just use this comments
487:09 - and here I can say
487:11 - comments. length is actually the number
487:14 - of comments that we have inside this
487:16 - video this is a hardc text and I don't
487:18 - have to change it uh the next I also
487:20 - want to display the profile picture of
487:22 - the guy who just posted that comment so
487:24 - for ding GE I actually just need a user
487:28 - model or I can just take the perect
487:29 - picture but I prefer to have the whole
487:32 - user model so I'm going to just say user
487:34 - model and I have this user let me just
487:36 - generate Constructor for it and I also
487:39 - want to have this the value of the user
487:41 - should be only this user this user that
487:45 - I have it right here so let me just
487:47 - initialize it I'm going to say the user
487:49 - will be equal to user I should say user.
487:54 - value and inside this video first
487:56 - comment I can just initialize this
487:59 - background image here and the background
488:01 - image which is going to be the profile
488:02 - picture for this guy is going to be once
488:04 - again let me just use this cached
488:06 - Network image provider and the URL is
488:08 - going to be just user. profile picture
488:12 - this should be good and now let me just
488:14 - initialize the most important thing here
488:16 - which is going to be the first comment
488:17 - and it is only the comments and I want
488:20 - to take the first comment here and I
488:23 - want to just specify that I want to take
488:24 - the common texture that should be all
488:26 - right now let me just do a hot rest
488:28 - start and check it out whether it's
488:30 - working or not now I'm going to just
488:32 - write a comment here first comment and
488:35 - hit send and here I have the first
488:38 - comment and right now when I get back I
488:40 - should see the first comment here as
488:42 - well and here we go we have this command
488:46 - displayed right here but it has some
488:48 - errors some bottom overflow so let me
488:50 - just fix this real quick and now the
488:52 - error is fixed and as you can see the
488:53 - first comment is displayed properly now
488:56 - I want to add the liking functionality
488:58 - as well and for doing it I'm going to
489:00 - just do it right here whenever the users
489:02 - click on this Thum up button they should
489:04 - be able to like this video and I can
489:06 - just do it right here inside this on the
489:08 - property and I'm going to just create
489:11 - this method called like video so let me
489:13 - just create this method uh in this state
489:16 - and I'm going to just create it right
489:19 - here it's going to be an a method and I
489:23 - have to create the actual method inside
489:26 - this video rep itory inside this video
489:29 - repository after now I have only one
489:31 - method called upload video to the firer
489:33 - and I also want to put this method to
489:35 - like video as well right here so I can
489:38 - just create this method which I'm going
489:40 - to just call like video again it's an
489:42 - asynchron method and I should be able to
489:45 - like video here so the algorithm I'm
489:47 - going to just create for liking video is
489:49 - going to be something like if my uid is
489:53 - inside the list of likes on that
489:55 - specific video in that case it means
489:57 - that I have already liked that video so
489:59 - in this case I'm going to just dislike
490:00 - it but if it is the opposite I'm going
490:03 - to just dislike that video so if it's
490:05 - not clear for you just make sure to
490:07 - follow along and you will understand
490:08 - what I mean uh first of all I need to
490:10 - have some parameters here inside this
490:12 - like video and the first one is going to
490:15 - be just a list of all the likes so I
490:18 - want to just have access to the people
490:20 - who has liked that specific video the
490:24 - next parameter is going to be the video
490:25 - ID so I want to have access that video
490:28 - ID of the video that you are trying to
490:30 - like and the next one should be so maybe
490:32 - that's enough let me just create it and
490:34 - later on we will understand so what
490:37 - actually I want to do is first of all
490:39 - create an instance of Firebase fire
490:40 - store and then I'm going to go inside
490:42 - the collection of videos and then the
490:46 - doc is going to be the video ID so I
490:48 - have this inside my parameter I'm going
490:51 - to go inside the collection of videos
490:53 - and then I'm going to go inside the
490:55 - document with this video ID and then I'm
490:58 - going to just update so what should I
491:00 - update here is going to be first of all
491:02 - let me create this I'm going to update a
491:04 - parameter called likes and this is a
491:07 - list actually and I want to update this
491:11 - uh fi likes so I need to use this field
491:14 - value and then I can use this array
491:17 - Union if you are not already familiar
491:20 - with this thing a reunion field value
491:22 - it's just something that I can use to
491:24 - modify and update the value of this
491:27 - field in this case it's a likes it is a
491:30 - list and I just want to update this
491:32 - field so I can just use this field
491:34 - value. AR Union and I'm going to just go
491:36 - through this list of likes and add my
491:39 - uid so I can also have the current user
491:42 - uid
491:45 - here and I'm going to just add the
491:47 - current user ID inside this list but
491:51 - when are we doing this we will be doing
491:53 - this whenever the video is not already
491:56 - liked by me
491:57 - so if I haven't liked that video I want
491:59 - to do this so let me create this
492:02 - condition first of all I'm going to just
492:03 - cut it and here I'm going to create a
492:05 - condition to say if likes do so this
492:10 - likes is going to be a list let me also
492:11 - specify this that this likes is going to
492:14 - be a
492:15 - list if likes.
492:19 - contains my uid which is going to be
492:21 - current user ID and I'm going to just
492:23 - put an exclamation mark here to say it
492:26 - should be the verse what does it mean is
492:29 - if my current ID is not inside this
492:32 - likes list in this case I want to like
492:35 - that video because it means that I
492:37 - haven't liked that video and I want to
492:39 - do it so I can just paste this one it
492:41 - means that I have to like that video but
492:45 - if that is the opposite so I can just
492:46 - copy once again here from this side not
492:48 - exclamation mark to say if I have
492:52 - already liked that video so the likes
492:54 - list contains my uid it means that I
492:56 - have already liked that video and in
492:58 - this case I just want to dislike that
493:00 - video so I can just copy this one here
493:03 - and I'm going to just change this array
493:05 - Union to array remove let me explain one
493:09 - second that what I have done inside this
493:11 - method I have three parameters the likes
493:13 - list it's a list of all the likes inside
493:16 - that video the next I have this video ID
493:18 - and also I have the current user ID what
493:20 - I'm seeing here is if my current user ID
493:23 - is not inside this list of likes it
493:26 - means that I haven't like that video and
493:28 - in this case I want to like it I want to
493:30 - insert my uid inside the list of likes
493:34 - and if it is the reverse it means that I
493:36 - have already liked that video I want to
493:37 - do the opposite and I just want to
493:39 - remove my uid from this list now I can
493:42 - actually use this method before that let
493:43 - me also specify that this like video is
493:46 - going to be a type of future and it
493:48 - doesn't return anything so it can be
493:50 - just void and also I have to make this
493:52 - method a synchronize and also await this
493:55 - and also this one
493:57 - now it should be good and I can just use
493:59 - this and I can do it using this long
494:02 - video provider so let me just get back
494:04 - to this video and right here I can use a
494:08 - RI to say I want to watch this provider
494:11 - let me just import it and then I can use
494:14 - this like video I need to provide this
494:18 - uh three parameters here the likes and
494:20 - also video ID and current user U ID and
494:22 - also let me just just to be safe let me
494:24 - make these three parameters required
494:27 - because they should be required and I'm
494:30 - going to just put some required before
494:32 - them uh it's not that much necessary but
494:35 - just to be safe it's better choice now I
494:38 - can get back to this video and I have to
494:40 - initialize them the first one is going
494:42 - to be the current user ID and it can be
494:44 - just the U ID of my current user and I
494:46 - can just uh find it using this Firebase
494:50 - .n. current
494:52 - user. uid the next one is going to be
494:55 - the list of likes and I have again
494:58 - access to this uh let me just see it so
495:01 - this is the video and I can just have
495:03 - access to it using
495:05 - video. likes first of all let me just
495:08 - use this
495:09 - widget. video. likes and the next one is
495:13 - going to be the video ID and it can be
495:15 - again viget video. video ID so now it
495:19 - should be good just let me make this
495:21 - method a wait now it should work and
495:24 - before testing it out I also want to
495:26 - bring some changes when I like the video
495:28 - in default this button thumb up color is
495:32 - equal to black but whenever we like the
495:34 - video it should change to Blue so let me
495:37 - also create this functionality as well
495:39 - and it's really easy I can just give it
495:41 - a color and here the color is going to
495:43 - be based on a condition I'm going to
495:45 - just say uh if this widget. video. likes
495:51 - it means this list of likes contains my
495:54 - current user view IDE this fire .
495:58 - instance. Curren user uid if it contains
496:02 - that let me see what's wrong here so if
496:05 - this list of likes contains my current
496:07 - user uid it means that I have liked that
496:10 - video and in this case I want the color
496:12 - of this button to be blue but if it is
496:15 - not true I just wanted to have a color
496:18 - of black now it should be good and also
496:22 - I want to display the number of likes
496:24 - right here so I need to create a text
496:27 - here to say I want to display how many
496:30 - likes this uh video has so for doing it
496:33 - I can just create something like this
496:36 - and here I'm going to just say widget.
496:39 - video. likes. length I just want to
496:42 - display how many likes this video has so
496:45 - now everything should be perfect and let
496:46 - me just run the project to see if it's
496:48 - working or not so now let's check it out
496:51 - when I click on this like
496:53 - button and right now after I do a hot
496:56 - rest start
496:57 - as you can see the video is being liked
496:59 - now let me also put a size box here
497:01 - between these two so I'm going to go
497:04 - inside this video and then let me find
497:06 - the th
497:10 - up and right here I can just add a size
497:12 - box it will have a weight of like
497:16 - five and right now as you can see it
497:19 - looks much beautiful there is only one
497:21 - point about liking this video here and
497:23 - it is that it's not real time I did not
497:26 - use any stream for liking the video and
497:29 - as you saw I needed a hot restart to see
497:31 - the changes so here I'm going to give
497:34 - you another homework try to use a stream
497:36 - provider and make the changes in real
497:39 - time and that's not really hard so I'm
497:41 - going to give you a hint that how can
497:43 - you do it you can just create an stream
497:45 - provider and get all the data of videos
497:48 - using that stream provider and then use
497:51 - that value in the like uh section so you
497:54 - will be able to see all the changes in
497:56 - real time so now first of all let me put
497:59 - all the pages together and for doing it
498:01 - I'm going to just open this Pages list
498:03 - and here the first pitch here should be
498:05 - this long video
498:07 - screen after that I want this short
498:10 - video screen right after this long video
498:12 - and the next one is going to be search
498:14 - screen upload so search screen should be
498:16 - after this upload and the final page is
498:18 - going to be the logout page so now this
498:21 - should be good and we're good to go the
498:23 - next feature that I want to create is
498:25 - actually the view feat Fe so whenever
498:28 - the user clicks on a post and they are
498:30 - navigated to the video screen and they
498:32 - are just watching a video the views for
498:34 - that specific video should be
498:35 - incremented by one and the best place
498:38 - for creating this view functionality is
498:40 - going to be right inside this post that
498:43 - whenever the user clicks on a thumbnail
498:45 - and they are navigated to this video
498:47 - right after the navigation I want to
498:49 - increment the views of that video and
498:52 - for doing it I can just create an
498:54 - incense of Firebase fire ster and I'm
498:56 - going to going to go inside the
498:57 - collection of videos into the document
498:59 - of video ID so let me just find what is
499:01 - the video ID here I should have it as a
499:03 - parameter yeah I can just say video.
499:07 - video ID and then I'm going to just
499:10 - update one field here and it's going to
499:12 - be the field of views so I'm going to
499:14 - just say the field of views let me just
499:17 - uh like this that you can see the code
499:20 - properly so what I did I just went into
499:23 - the collection of videos the document of
499:25 - video ID so I want to just uh increment
499:28 - the views of this specific video I'm
499:31 - just updating it and I just want to make
499:34 - it this field so I'm going to just say
499:36 - field value you already know using this
499:38 - I can go inside this field and I want to
499:41 - increment and I'm going to just
499:42 - increment a number of one so just doing
499:45 - this I can actually increment the views
499:47 - filled inside this video by one and this
499:50 - should be good now the last feature that
499:53 - I also want to add inside this project
499:55 - is going to be the Subscribe Feature so
499:56 - whenever the user clicks subscribe on a
499:58 - specific Channel they should be able to
500:01 - subscribe that channel and I'm going to
500:03 - just create this function right inside
500:06 - the channel uh folder the users Channel
500:10 - and here I have a provider called
500:12 - Channel provider so I believe I can just
500:16 - create another provider for this and
500:19 - actually I need a provider or maybe I
500:22 - need a repository so I'm going to just
500:23 - create a new file called subscribe
500:26 - repository and here actually first of
500:29 - all let me create a class I'm going to
500:30 - just call this subscribe and here I can
500:34 - have first of all an innocense of
500:36 - Firebase firer just like what we did
500:38 - always and I think maybe I don't need an
500:41 - innocense of Firebase all so that should
500:43 - be it and now actually I want to
500:46 - generate Constructor for
500:48 - this that should be good so here I'm
500:51 - going to just create a method called
500:53 - subscribe
500:55 - Channel and a this method and here the
500:59 - way that you want to subscribe channels
501:01 - is exactly like we like the videos so
501:04 - they exactly the same we have likes list
501:08 - in the video model and also I have a
501:11 - subscribe subscriptions list inside the
501:14 - user model or the channel model so
501:16 - they're going to be the way of uh doing
501:18 - them is going to be really the same and
501:20 - there's no difference and just like the
501:23 - previous one I need to have three
501:25 - required parameters here the first one
501:27 - is going to be the user ID so this user
501:29 - ID is the user of the channel who we are
501:32 - trying to subscribe the next one is
501:34 - going to be the current user ID I mean
501:36 - the user of myself that I'm trying to
501:38 - subscribe a channel and also I may need
501:42 - the subscriptions list so I want to know
501:45 - all the people who have subscribed that
501:47 - channel so I need a subscriptions list
501:48 - as well here so now uh the way I'm doing
501:52 - it is again creating some conditions to
501:54 - say if the uh first of all let me
501:56 - specify that the subscriptions is a list
501:59 - I'm going to just say that if this list
502:01 - of subscriptions contains my user id the
502:05 - current user ID this means that I have
502:08 - already subscribed that a specific
502:10 - channel so for doing it I need to remove
502:12 - my subscription so let me just create an
502:15 - instance of Firebase firer I can just
502:17 - use this firer and then I'm going to go
502:20 - inside a collection of users the doc
502:23 - should be so I'm trying to remove my
502:25 - subscription from that specific channel
502:28 - so the doc here should be the user ID
502:31 - and I just want to update a field here
502:33 - which is going to be the field of
502:35 - subscription and here I'm going to just
502:37 - say fi value and I want to remove my
502:40 - subscription from this list so I'm going
502:43 - to just say remove the current user ID
502:45 - from here so that should be good I just
502:48 - need to do like this so what I said here
502:51 - is that if the list of subscriptions
502:53 - contains my user ID so this means that I
502:55 - have already subscribe this Channel and
502:58 - for doing it I just want to remove my
503:00 - subscriptions my user ID from this field
503:03 - of subscriptions so this was the first
503:06 - condition and the second one is going to
503:07 - be like this it's going to be exactly uh
503:10 - the reverse of this one I can say if the
503:13 - subscriptions let me copy this one and I
503:16 - just need to add an exclamation mark at
503:18 - the beginning to just reverse everything
503:20 - here I'm going to just say if the
503:23 - current user ID if my ID is not inside
503:25 - the list of sub subscriptions in this
503:27 - case I want to add it so I going to just
503:29 - copy this but I just need to change this
503:32 - AR remove to array Union I want to add
503:35 - my ID inside this collection so now
503:39 - everything should be okay let me just
503:40 - make this method a wait and also I will
503:43 - do this for this one so this should be
503:45 - good let me just correct this one and
503:48 - now I can actually use this subscribe
503:51 - Channel method and also I want to
503:53 - specify that this is a feature of void
503:55 - and so let me see where should I use
503:58 - actually this subscribe Channel method
504:01 - the first place that I'm going to use it
504:02 - is inside the video so let me open this
504:05 - video and find this uh subscribe flat
504:09 - button it should be uh here let me just
504:12 - find it real
504:13 - quick so here is the first place that
504:16 - actually I want to use it and actually
504:18 - here I want to subscribe user and I will
504:21 - have a comment here to say subscribe you
504:24 - Channel and also a just forgot to add a
504:28 - provider here so let me just find the
504:29 - subscribed repository and here I also
504:32 - want to add a provider here so I'm going
504:34 - to just call it subscribe Channel
504:37 - provider and it's going to be a simple
504:39 - provider and here I'm going to just
504:40 - return this subscribe and also I need to
504:43 - require this I need to make this
504:45 - required and now I have to initialize
504:47 - this fire ster which is going to be the
504:49 - Firebase firer do any
504:52 - sense so now I have this let me just use
504:55 - this provider inside video I'm going to
504:58 - go inside this video and here I can
505:00 - actually use this so I'm going to say
505:03 - riat this provider and I'm going to just
505:06 - subscribe the channel here I need to
505:09 - initialize some values the user ID the
505:11 - user ID here is going to be just uh let
505:13 - me just find it first of all I'm going
505:15 - to just put a comma here and also a s
505:17 - column okay I have a video that is one
505:21 - of the things I have and also I have
505:23 - this any user data provider which I get
505:26 - a user from this so I have everything
505:28 - here and the user ID is going to be just
505:32 - user. user ID I should have this uh
505:35 - value. user ID and this should be good
505:39 - the next I need the current user ID and
505:40 - it's really simple I can just get it
505:42 - using Firebase fire ster actually
505:45 - Firebase all I need to create an of
505:48 - firebase. instance docar user. uid and
505:53 - the next one is going to be the list of
505:55 - subscriptions and again easy I can just
505:57 - say widget.
506:00 - video. subscriptions actually again I
506:04 - need the user so I'm going to just say
506:05 - user. value. subscriptions so this
506:08 - should be okay and now I have actually
506:10 - all the values here and let me just make
506:12 - this meod a and await this and now I
506:15 - should be able to actually uh subscribe
506:19 - all the channels and one other Placer I
506:22 - also want to add this uh method here is
506:24 - going to be just I'm going to just copy
506:26 - this inside the search screen here is
506:28 - also one of the places that I can
506:30 - actually subscribe user inside this
506:32 - search channel tile so I also have I
506:34 - also should have uh a subscribe button
506:36 - here as you can see I have it and here
506:38 - I'm going to just I'm going to just
506:39 - paste this in here okay so I'm going to
506:42 - just convert this stess widget into a
506:44 - consumer vidget first and I need to add
506:47 - the viget dri
506:48 - here this should be good and I'm going
506:52 - to just import this I also need to
506:55 - import one let me see here first let me
506:58 - import this Firebase off and now this
507:00 - should be good the only thing I need
507:02 - here is going to be the value of user
507:04 - because I don't have the value of user
507:07 - here so let me see actually I have this
507:10 - yeah this is going to be the user so I
507:12 - have this I just need to remove this
507:14 - value I don't need to have it so now we
507:17 - are done here and it should be working
507:19 - and we should be able to subscribe
507:21 - channels so that was it and I hope you
507:24 - got the most out of this tutorial and
507:26 - now you can try building similar
507:27 - projects on your own to examine all the
507:29 - stuff you have learned here so bye and
507:31 - good luck

learn how to build a fully functional YouTube clone using flutter UI kit Firebase as a backend and River pod for State Management this tutorial covers everything from Google signin authentication to uploading and displaying videos profile customization and much more designed for beginners it will guide you through Firebase and River pod from scratch but a basic understanding of flutter and dart is recommended am Min from code HQ created this course let's start an amazing journey of creating the fully stck YouTube clone with tons of great features and a beautiful UI this tutorial is designed to make you master not only flutter but also Firebase and reward po 2.5 if you are an absolute beginner don't worry as I go through Concepts step by step and will cover different Technologies to complete this app we'll start off by signing user with Google and collecting users data for creating username we will check the fire database in real time to see if username is not repeated and if it was show an error to say username is already already taken inside the homepage we can see all the videos uploaded from different channels users can upload their own videos in title description and select the thumbnail manually when video is uploaded by clicking it we are navigated on the actual video page which has exactly the same yoi as the YouTube in your phone I can play the video and move it back or forward we can also like the video see number of viewers And subscribe to their Channel I can add comment to the video and the first comment will be displayed under the video similar to the actual YouTube also while opening a video I can see all the other suggested videos under it next it also has a powerful search engine and I can filter videos and channels at the same time and I can open any channel or video by clicking on it I have my personal Channel with all my information and videos I have uploaded also a channel settings page which allow me to customize the channel profile beside long videos I'm also able to upload short videos edit the video and Export it this course is for beginners and to get it started you don't need any knowledge of Firebase or river poot you just need to have a basic understanding of flut and dart by the end of tutorial you will be familiar with most of Firebase features like authentication signing methods database storage and a lot of useful methods and classes you will also learn different rivert concepts and providers to manage a state inside flut projects so if you're ready let's get it started the first thing that I need to do is to create my Firebase project and I'm going to just do it using the flut fire CLI and it is really a great way to create your fire project which is really easy so let's just open the CMD and here I'm going to just uh use the flut fi uh CLI to create my fireb project before starting make sure that new Js is installed in your computer and if it is done just run this command which it will install fireb tools inside your computer it will take a while and then fireb will be installed very well now fireb should be installed in my computer and I can just check it using the Firebase D Dash version using this command you can just check if FL uh if Firebase is installed in your computer and as you can see this is the current version of my Firebase is and it is a result now I want to just go and open my project so I can just use this command to go inside my YouTube clone project and here the next thing that I need to do is to sign in with my Firebase account so I'm going to just use the Firebase login command which it will go and uh enable me to log in with my current account I'm already logged in with this account but I'm not going to continue with this because I want to log in with another account so I can just use the Firebase log out and using this command I can just log out from my current account and I want to log in with another account so I will run the command Firebase login once again now I hit yes and now it will open the chome for me which allow me to use any account I want to sign in with I have two account I want to use my second account and I will sign in with this one just hit the continue and now all it very well now we are signed it with my fire account very well and as you can see it is also logged in here the next comment that I need to use is this one which it will just go and activate Fifi CLI inside my project so I'm going to just run it it won't take long and fifier CLI will be activated and now as a last step you need to configure your Fifi so I'm going to just run the command Fifi configure and it will just go ahead and fish all the available fire projects that I have and as you can see I have not any project and I I can just go and create a new Fus project the name of the Fus project that I'm going to use is YouTube am Min ahmed2 so I'm going to use this uh name or ID for my fibus project also keep in mind that your Fus project should not be already taken and if it is taken you will not be able to create a f uh you will not be able to create your fireb project so keep this in mind and hit enter now it's creating my fibus project we are having some error so let me run this command once again flut fire configure let's see if we can create our Fus project right now let's give a name to our fibers project I'm going to give it a name YouTube Ahmed amini clone let's hit enter and now it's trying to create my fbas project and again we are getting some error let me just try to create my Firebase project from the console it is also available for me I'm going to just open firebase.com and let's see if we can create a project right here I'm going to change my account to the second one and I want to create my Firebase project here let's see if we can create our project from the console hit on the create project and I'm going to just uh call it YouTube Ahmed amini yeah I can just create this project and hit continue make sure to uh not check this enable Google analytics for this project and then head to create your first Prest project now it's trying to create my project so let's wait for it oh very well after some problems and errors now finally I can create my Firebase project and it is created so let's hit continue and now I have my Firebase project so now let's get back here and I'm going to run the command flutter fire configure once again and and now it's stying to fish my fireb project and I should have one Firebase projects already so let's just find that project and as you can see yeah I have the project uh the name is YouTu clone and I'm going to just hit enter the next thing you can do is to you can choose which platforms you want to configure and I'm going to just do it for Android and iOS so just hit the space button to deselect Mac OS and Vib and hit enter now it's fetching my configuration for Android and when it is done it will also do it for iOS so let's wait for it till all the config uh all the configurations are done very well finally hit yes and now my fibus project is created and everything is done so let's just open the project uh I can also show you that Google services. Json file is automatically generated for me and also I have a file called Firebase options with all the config uh all the configurations related to Firebase is generated inside this file and everything is done for us automatically now let's just finish our configurations before starting you need to make sure that you have all the Firebase packages installed inside your PML file so I'm going to tell you once again that it's highly recommended that you download the starting project from my GitHub which is the link in the description below and if you download it you can access to all this Firebase projects and everything in the starting project so make sure to do it if you download the starting project you will have all this but if not you have to install this packages Firebase out Firebase core Firebase storage and all other packages uh these are related to the Firebase and also you need to install the package Google sign in which we use it to sign with Google which is the package right here very well as a last step I need to initialize my Firebase inside men Dart I just need to add some lines of cut here yeah just add here and now I need to import Firebase code and also I need to import the Firebase options file inside my project also uh because we are using FL River Po in this tutorial I need to wrap my app here with provider scope because we are going to need it I'm going to just use provider SC here and the child will be my app and now I will be able to use FL rivp inside my project everything is done and I have it's working just run the emulator very well now the emulator is run and as you can see we are seeing only a black screen because we have nothing in our men Dart and we are only placing a container and now I'm going to just create my login page and there I can just create all the logic and UI related to the signing user with Google so let's work on it first of all I need to create a a folder called a and inside this folder I can just uh create all the stuff related to signing the user with Google and first of all I'm going to create a file called login page just import the material. dart and create an inad this widget I'm going to call it login page and here let's return and scaffold and we'll create everything here just take the login page and put it inside this instead of this container and import the login page now as you can see we are seeing this screen so let's work on the UI I will also minimize this page that I can see my emulator first of all I will work on the UI of this page and then I will create the logic and functionality to sign in user with Google first let me give it a background color and I will use for now only a background of gray later on I can change this next I can just go inside the body and I can create a safe area the child will be just a center widget and again child will be a column very good so the first thing that I'm going to create inside this column will be an image and I just want to show a YouTube logo image inside this column and I should also tell you that inside this accet folder I have all icons and also images that I will use throughout this project so I'm going to say once again that please download the starting project which you will access all these assets and everything inside this project and I'm going to use a lot of uh these images throughout this project and the first one will be just uh YouTube logo so I'm going to just create an asset image and the image first of all I need to mention the assets then images and then the image that I'm going to use here is an image called YouTube Das signin jpack very good and as you can see this is the logo I'm going to also change the height and I will give it a height of 150 let me also remove this background color I think the original white background color is the best for this also I'm going to give it a padding and also some more style let's wrap it with a padding widget and I will just give it a padding only from the top and also a padding of 25 from the bottom a padding of 20 from the top and also a pading of 25 from the bottom very well now it looks very nice next I will also create a text which inside this text I'm going to just say welcome to YouTube let's also change the text style of this text and I'm going to give it a pH size of 30 and also a pH way of bold and I uh and also I'm going to change the color and I will give it a color of blue gray now I think it looks much better the next I'm going to just give it a spacer and the final thing that I'm going to add here is going to be a button so at the end of this page right here I want to add a button in which the user will be able to sign in with Google whenever the user Taps on a button and for doing it I'm going to just use an image that I have already in my assets folder so let's again uh use the image. assets and again first of all I need to mention the assets then images and the name of the image that we are using here is sign in with google.png sign in with google.png this is the image that you're using here and as you can see this is the exact image let's just change the height and I'm going to just give it a height of 60 I'm going to also wrap it with a padding and I'm going to just give it a padding only from the bottom and a padding of 55 very nice I think it looks very nice the last step that I need to do is to wrap uh this assd image with a just sctor because I want the user to be able to click on this button and when they click it I uh they should be able to sign with Google let's just wrap it with the gure detector and it has an an property which it will be empty for now later on I will add the logic and functionality so that's it uh the UI of this login page is created now we can just go and create the function to sign in with Google let me just create a folder which I'm going to call it repository and another folder which I will call it pages I will move the login page inside the pages I'm going to just do it to make our code more readable and maintainable later on we can read our code much easier in this way and inside the repository I'm going to create a file called OD service and inside this service I can create all the uh logic related to letting user sign in with Google so everything will be here and our code will be much readable and maintainable let's create a class called OD service and here first of all I want to Define two fils one will be Firebase o and the next one will be Google sign in and we need both of them to make user sign in with Google so let's just SC them the first one will be Firebase ALS I need to import it let me import this first I'm going to import Firebase out and I'm going to also import Google sign in now I can just create an inance of Firebase art which I'm going to just call it us and I'm also going to create an in sense of Google sign in which I'm going to just call it Google sign in very well I also generate Constructor for it and it is done so let's work on the logic how can we let user sign in with Google let me just create a method which I'm going to just call it sign in with Google it is an a synr method and I can just use the inocence of Google sign in which I just created and the first method that I create here or I should say the first method I'm going to use here is a method called sign in and what does this method does it will just pop up a window which all user to choose its Google account from all the Google accounts that the user has so I can just uh save the result of this method inside the variable which I'm going to just call it user very well now I can use the user and I'm going to just call the method authenticate of course first of all I need to make it await because we don't know when the user will choose its account and once you await it now I can use the method authentication and doing that user will be signed in now I will just put it inside a variable called Google ass very well the next thing that I want to do is to create a credential and I can just use the Google OD provider and then you use this credential using this I can create my credential and as you can see we have two properties here the first one is access token and the next one is ID token and we can just uh and we can just initialize this access token and ID token using this Google art that we already created I can just uh use Google art and then call Access token Google art do access token let's see what's wrong here yeah I forgot to make this method await as well because we need to await this method as well and now it's working for the ID token I also need to use this google. ID token and now it's working I will just save this credential inside a variable called credential and the last step that I need to do is to connect my Firebase art with Google signning so everything I did up to now was signing with Google but it has nothing to do with fireus off but that is not what we want we also wanted to connect with fireb art so as you can see we have this in a sense of o fireb o I'm going to just use it and then I have a method called sign in with credential and what I want to provide is this credential which the spelling is wrong let me just correct it credential and now it is done I can also await this method and now it is done and we can just sign in with Google using this method so right now it is done the last question is that how can we use this method the asset management solution that I'm going to use throughout this project as I said before will be FL River poot and using this Asset Management solution I will handle the state in my site my project which in this case it is a user so I can just handle this user and access it throughout my project using the FL rpod if you're already familiar with State Management Solutions and specifically flut R po you know why do we need to use it but if you are not familiar with it don't worry as I'm going to explain everything related to flut R pot throughout this project so let me just import FL R pot here let me also tell you that you need to install the package which is already inside my pp. file uh this is the package you need to install this package and once you uh install it you can just import it right here and the way that flod works is that it has a lot of providers and the most important uh ones and famous ones that we are going to use a lot throughout this project will be the simple provider stream provider and especially future provider I'm going to use a lot this kind of providers and you will understand how I'm going to use it just follow along and you will understand how can I use it first I'm going to just create my first provider which I'm going to just call it OD service provider and I'm going to just use the simple provider and as you can see when I create this provider I access to a riff and this riff is just some magic stuff from FL part which allow us to do a lot of things especially we can connect our providers together so use this RI later on I can create consumer widget and then I can connect and access to this provider and I will return return it this class at service you will understand what I mean if you can't understand what I mean don't worry when I do it you will understand how does it work so what I'm going to return is this class odd service and we have two fills to initialize the first one is a which I'm going to just give it firebase. innocense and also the second one is Google signin which I just need to give it an in a sense of Google sign in and now the errors are gone very well let me also do like this that we can see the full screen so I just created my first uh provider which is OD service provider and now I can use it to handle the set which in this case it is a user so let's get back to the login page so you saw how I created the provider but now what you need to know is how can we use this provider inside our UI page which in this case it's a login page the way that FL workot works is that you need to create a consumer wiget and using this magic consumer Viet you can access to your all uh providers and states that you have in your FL r pod and inside your project so there are two ways that you can create consumer widget I I can just change the whole stess widget or also stateful widget to a consumer widget or I can just create a consumer widget in a specific part of my my file so I can just create a consumer widget as a widget or I can just change the whole status widget into a consumer widget so I'm going to show you both how can you do it but the first thing that I'm going to do is to change this St widget into a consumer widget now I need to add a second property inside this build method which is going to be type widget riff and I'm going to just call it riff and now accessing this riff I can do uh I can access to my provider I come here inside this ontap property at the end of my page which is exactly right here and here using this riff I can use some methods like read or watch I need to explain something that there are two methods that we can use using this ref you can use read or you can use watch and there is a big difference between these two meals read and watch and through this project when I'm working you will understand when when do you need to use read and when do you need to use watch so you will understand all of that just make sure to follow along just for now I'm going to tell you this that whenever you're doing something that you need to do it only once you will use the read method but when you uh you use watch method you want to keep keep track of something because you don't want to do it once and you do want it to do multiple times and you want to keep track of the changes that is happening on that provider so in short when you want to keep track of the changes inside the provider and you want to understand whether the value has changed or not you need to use watch but if you don't care if the value changes or not or you don't want to get uh or you don't want to keep track the changes you can use the rate method and mostly inside this on properties is uh we use the red method and inside the Bel methods most of the times we use watch method it's also a tip that you can use it for now I'm going to just use the read method and the provider I'm going to use is this OD service provider so let's just paste it here and also import it now I can access to my sign in with Google method very well I can also make it a synness and await this method we are done what else I want to do is I want to go inside the men. dart and I want to check whether we are signed in or not how can we do it we can do it using a stream Builder so I'm going to just take this login page and instead I'm going to just use an stream Builder so the stream off for this stream Builder will be a method from Firebase art so first of all I need to create an inocence of Firebase art and then I can use a specific method which is used here which is called our state changes and what does this method does it will just go and check what's happening inside fireb alt so it will just give us information about what's going on in the fire o whether we are signed in specifically uh it will check whether we are signed in or not and inside the Builder I can just check it so I'm going to just create two conditions for now the first first conditions will be snapshot. has data and if it's not so if a snapshot. has data is not true it means that we do not have any data in this case I'm going to just go and return a login page and if that's not the case it means that we have data and the user is signed in in that case I'm going to just show a container for now so I'm going to just return container very well now I'm going to just terminate the current project and run it once again so now let's check if it's working or not I'm going to head on the button sign in with Google and I can just choose my Ahmed amini account I really forgot a very big step here I forgot to enable the Google sign in as a provider method to to all of us to sign with it and also I need to generate show one and 256 to be able to use Google sign in I'm really sorry I forgot these two big steps so let's do it right now first of all I'm going to go inside my project let's go inside the authentication part head on the get started and now I want to be able to sign in with Google and we need to just enable the sign in method as you can see these are all the signin videos that you can use to sign in with Firebase email password Google Facebook and a lot of this but what I want to be able to use is Google signin so just hit it here and I just enable it to be able to use Google sign in the you also need to provide a supportive email here and I'm going to just use my T Ahmed amini Emil here and then hit save very well now it's going to be enable us to use Google sign in our fire project it is done and the second thing that I need to do is to generate sha one and sha 256 in my fire project so let's get back to the vs code and open Terminal first of all go to Android and here you need to use a command which will generate but shs in your project just run this command GR signing report and we got an error let me just do it once again yeah it's working and it's generating show and and also shot 256 for my Firebase project let's wait for it and now it is buil successfully as you can see so this is the first one show one just copy it get back to the fireb console uh go to project overview and I believe uh I just need to find my app okay now let's go to the first app I'm going to just do it for Android for now and add fingerprint and here you can just paste your first showan and paste it right here and save the file get back to the vs good and now I'm going to just copy the second one add fingerprint and paste the second one very well now that we just generated the Sha one and also sh 256 everything is done and I can just sign it with Google and there should be no problem let's just once again terminate the current project and I'm going to just run it once again very well let's check if it's working click on the signning Google button choose your account yeah very well nice it's working as you can see if I just explain to you what happened right here so first of all we click on this button and it just went to this provider and used and triggered this signing with Google method and when it's triggered this method the signing finished here and in inside and inside the m dot I created a logic like this that create an Builder and inside this Builder we check the current or we check the current OD changes inside our Firebase OD so it just check whether we are signed in or not and we check here that if you are not signed in if the snapshot ha is not true in this case return the login page but if you're signed in just return a container for now but I'm going to change it in the future so I can just put a homepage here and now we'll have this homepage when we are signed in very well it's done it's working and now I need to work on the second part of my signing and R authentication okay so now let's start the second part which is going to be adding all the user data Into the Fire Reser database so not only I want Reser to be signed in with Google but after that I want them to add all the user data into collection and the database and for doing it I need to use the firer database so inside this uh Firebase console as you can see I'm going to open this fire database and now that it's open I can just click on create database here I need to choose a location and I'm going to just choose the southeast uh Asia Singapore it is the nearest place for my location just make sure to choose a place where it's near to where you're living currently just choose your location and hit next the next I'm going to just choose that it is uh only in test mode because it's not a real project and then I can just create this database let's wait for it to be created okay so as you can see the database is created and for now as you can see it's only an empty database and I'm going to just add all the information for user video and everything inside this database so for now it's okay and also this is going to be the rules section and here I can actually change the rules and I'm going to just remove this condition of if I can just remove it just keep in mind that I'm doing this because it's only a test mode project but if it's but if you're creating a project for production make sure to create the appropriate rules to just uh handle all the security things but for now because it's only for test mode I'm going to just publish this rules and that's all right now I can just get back to the vs code here inside the repository I'm going to just create a new file called user data service and here I'm going to just create the class called once again user data service here I need to actually create two fils one is going to be for the Firebase firer and the next one is going to be for Firebase o and I need to create both these and it will help me to use both the packages easily so first of all I'm going to just create the farest o and also it will be imported automatically and the next one is going to be for the farest fire store and let me just first of all import this package cloud firer and now I can create this field for Firebase firar and I'm going to just call this fire ster let me just generate Constructor for this as well and now I can create my first method to actually add the user data to the fire store so I'm going to just call this method add user data to firester and this method is going to be asness and I can just uh do everything necessary inside this method and actually first of all I need to create a user model here because you know if I want to add the user data into this collection of users first of all I need to store that inside a model so first of all I need to create this model so I'm going to just create a new folder called model and inside that I can actually create a a file called user model I'm going to just name this user model and I will create all the fs accessory to this user model and I'm going to have a lot of fields like display name username email profile picture and all of this so let me just create them one by one the first one is going to be a string called display name it is the first fied I want to create for this model the next one is going to be for the username let me just create it the third one is again a string of EML the next one is going to be for the profile picture the next one is number of subscriptions videos the next one is user ID and let me just also specify the data type which is going to be a string the next one is going to be uh description I also want to have an optional description for each Channel or user so the last one is going to be the type and if you wonder what is this type and why do I even need to use this you'll understand later on when I want to work on the search feature on that time I need to use this type fill inside the user model for now just remember that I'm going to need I'm going to need to use this type and I'm going to also add this field for the video model as well so I want to have it for both user model and also for the video model and that is all you need to know for now now let me just generate Constructor for this as well and I also want to generate Jon calization and that should be okay now I get back to the user data service and here I can actually create an instance of user model so let me just create it let me just import for this user model and then I'm going to just call this user and I will just create the inocence of this user model and now I need to initialize all values for this different fills and actually I'm going to do that using some parameters so I need to create some parameters to fill out the value use for this fills and I'm going to just create them one by one and all of them are going to be required and the first one is going to be for the display name and of course it's a type of string the next one is going to be for the username the next one is a string of ml the next one is for description the next one is going to be for the profile picture again it's a type of a string and the next one actually I have made a mistake here and I have made the wrong data type for the videos and also subscriptions and let me just go to the user model because the videos and the subscriptions is not a type of string but actually the videoos going to be as a type of integer and the subscriptions is going to be a type of list so make sure to just uh correct this it was a mistake this should not be strings and now let me just remove this adj realizations and I have to generate that once again let me just do it real quick okay that should be all right let me also specify that this list is a type of string so I have a list of strings for the subscriptions and I want to just generate Json realization once again I have to correct this error I just need to add an extra parentheses here and actually inside these two methods uh to map and from map maybe I want to change the field for the list of subscriptions because it may have generated the wrong one so I want to just bring some changes here so inside the FR map I'm going to just remove this thing for the subscription and I will create one from my own because this may not work properly so just remove it and instead use this one and now it should be working fine perfectly get back to the user data service and now I can create the actual parameters here uh first of all for the subscriptions let me just create this parameter and actually I don't need to create any parameter for the subscriptions and because for now I'm going to just leave it as an empty list because once the user is created and the channel is created it has no subscriptions it's going to be empty for now so that is the initial value just an empty list and for the videos I'm going to just leave it like zero that should be great and the next one is user ID and for the user ID actually I can just use the current U ID for the current user who is logged in because that is the exact user ID which I want to use and that's going to be unique for every and that's going to be unique for every each user so I can just use this o this in a sense of O and then I'm going to just bring it down and I'm going to just use the current user and then uid so the uid of the current user of the user who is logged in is going to be the user ID of that specific Channel and the final one is going to be the type and I'm going to just leave it as the user because that is a user model the type is going to be a user and later on I'm going to create the video model the top is going to be just a video and once again you will know what this about so just for now don't worry about it now that everything is done and I have the user model I can actually create the collection of users and add the user data inside that collection so I'm going to just use this inance of firestore and then I'm going to use the collection keyword and it will just create a new collection called users and if there's already a collection it will just add the data into the uh collection so I'm going to just go inside the collection of users and then I need to specify a document for this specific collection and this document is going to be just the current user and the U ID and this document is going to be just the current user that I'm going to just add and the uid for it is going to be just the exact user ID which I have so I'm going to just put this us. Curr user. uid as the user ID for this specific document and finally I'm going to just use the set method to actually set the all data I want to be inside that collection and this specific document and here I can just use this inance of user and then use a method called T map that I just created and using this T map I can actually add all the data into the firer database and I can actually add all this data Into the Fire database just like and this is a really better way to do that uh so now this stuff are done and we're good here very well now I have to create a provider for this class so once again we are using the provider FL R PO for this class to handle the set which in this case it is the user so I'm going to create another provider which I'm going to just call it user data service provider and of course once again we are using the simple provider which is a the simplest provider possible in FL rpod and here I'm going to just return this user data service class exactly like the previous example we need to initialize fire a and also fire fire so let's uh let's do it real quick very well and I'm going to just put some commas here to refactor for format de code very well now we have access to this provider and as I said already to you that why do we need to use this providers it will really help us to handle a set and use in this case like the user data we are able to use this user throughout our project and it makes life much easier for us so let's just take this and where do we need to add this provider this user data service provider I'm going to do it in username page so we don't have anyone yet let's create one so I'm going to create a new file which I'm going to just call it username page. Dart import the material. dart and just create an this wiget this is going to be just called username page and here I'm going to just return and scaped so the first thing I want to work on the UI of this uh uh username page and later on we can add the functionality and I will explain to you what each uh uh what do we need to do inside this username pitch so I'm going to I'm going to just explain everything later on first of all let's create the UI of this username pitch let me just run the emulator that we can see how the UI is looking okay this is what we got for now as you can see we are showing the homepage because we showed this inside of our meno Dart let me just open it real quick uh this is our meno Dart and right now what we're showing is just an stream Builder and we are saying that if we are signed in I should show a login page and in other cases I want to show the homepage but I'm going to change this to username page for now later on I will work it I will just change it and fix it completely but for now I'm going to just return the username page that we just created let me also just minimize the vs code that we can just see while we are working on the UI of this username page it's going to be like this okay I'm going to just close this page and open username pitch inside this scold let's move on to the body and here first of all I'm going to just create a safe area the child is going to be a padding widget and we have a symmetric padding widget and I'm going to just give it a padding vertically 26 and also horizontally 14 okay this is going to be my padding let me just close this one as well okay very well I'm going to also put a const here for now only or maybe I should remove it okay inside this padding I can have a text and this text is going to be just saying enter the username I'm going to also change the text style here and give it a color of blue gray very well and as you can see this is what we got for now uh I forgot to add a column here let me just uh take this padding and first of all inside the safe area I want to have a column and inside the children property I can have a lot of widgets and the first widget right here is going to be the padding widget which is a text which says enter the username after this I want to add the next fidget which is a text field so we want to allow user to enter a username and we need a text field to do that so I'm going to just create a text form field which it has a lot of uh properties which I have to add first of all I want to work on the decoration of this text field which is which needs a class called input decoration let me just change the properties first of all I have to give it a hand text which going to be just saying like uh insert username this is going to be my hand text I'm going to also add a border which is the type class of outline input border and it has a b site which I'm going to just change the color inside this border s and I'm going to give you the color of blue let me just put some commas here to format the code now I also want to add uh not only border but enabled border and also Focus border so it just changes uh I want to change the color of this borders on different uh uh conditions for example uh if it is in ened border I want to give it a blue color if it is a focused border I want to give it a green color so let's just quickly work on this one as well first of all if you have an enabled border let me just copy this cod as well I also want the color of the Border Side to be blue but if you have a focus B in this case I want to change the color to something like green and I think this looks very nice as you can see the color is right now blue but if I click on it it got on a focus mode and right now the color is green and it looks very nice the next one I want to add a suffix icon which for now I'm going to just use icons verified user rounded and the color of this suffix icon is going to be just a color of green so I'm going to just give it a colors of green later on I'm going to change this because uh the suffix icon also safix icon color needs to be changed based on validation so let me tell you right now that I want to add a validation feature for this username text field it means that whenever the user is typing a username I'm going to go through the database and I'm checking that if there is a username the same as the user has typed inside this textfield if it is the same it means that this username is already taken and it is similar in this case I'm going to give the user an error to say you have to change your username because it is already taken inside our database so when you want to work on that functionality as well I need to change some UI which one of them is the suffix icon and also suffix icon color which if the validation is true I'm going to show this verified user around it but if the validation is false it mean the user is not allowed to continue I'm going to show it uh cancel icon so I'm going to work on that one as well so I just told you already to know it I also need to wrap this text form field with a padding widget so I'm going to add a padding and the padding is going to be just from right side and also left side give it a padding once from the left side which is going to be a padding of 20 and also from the right side I'm going to give it a padding of 15 let me just also change the left side to 15 again I'm going to just minim uh resize this V good that we can see this emulator properly very well this looks very nice and finally what I need to add is I need to add an spacer first of all because you want to give a resize and finally I need to add a button at the bottom of the ptch because this is where the user will be able to submit this T field so I'm going to just create a flat button so if you wonder what is this a flat button it is is a button that I have already created and I can just open this flat Button as you can see it takes three arguments a text unpress and also a color so you can just change it on uh on whatever you like and inside this widget we have only a container and then a text buttom so it's really simple and of course if you have downloaded this starting project you have access to all this uh widget pages and everything that I'm going to use throughout this project now I have to initialize this text on present the text is going to be just something like continue not anything else the unpress is going to be empty for now later on I'm going to add some stuff to it and the color is going to be just a color of green for now very well and now you're getting an error I don't know what's the reason let me just run this uh project once again let me just terminate this and also run the project once again yeah this is what we have so far uh what I need the final step for the completing of the UI of this page is to just go up and here inside the column I need to change the cross AIS alignment properties and I'm going to just give it something like cross access alignment. stretch and it should solve everything for us and as you can see this is what we got and also the enter usern text is now at the beginning so it's great let me also just give it a padding to this flat button because it's not looking very nice so I'm going to just wrap this with a padding widget and I'm going to just give it a padding from bottom something like 45 or I should give it a little smaller like 30 and also I'm going to give it padding from left side eight and also right side eight and now it looks perfect let's also add some const to this this file because it giving it's giving us some warning which is not looking very nice and Al it's also slowing down the computer so let's just add this const and now everything is good so now that we are done with uh creating of this UI I need to work on the functionality and the first functionality that I'm going to work on is to have the unique user's name so what I basically want to do is to whenever the user is typing something inside this text field and they're entering their username I you want to add this functionality that it should just go and check the database and if the username that is typed inside this text field is similar to any of the text uh to any of the usernames inside my database if they're the same I want to just give an error to the user to say the user name is already taken so this is my goal and let's work on this first I need to change this estate widget to an stateful widget and I need to set uh I need to add some more properties to this text form field right now let me just go inside this textt form field I need to add first of all a controller and also I need a for key here uh we need a key and also I just need to wrap this text form field with a form widget very well so let me just go and create first of all the controller it is a type text editing controller which in this case I'm going to just call it username controller very well and I also going to create a form key I'm going to just call it form key and it is a global key which is the type form State very well I can just use this form key and put it inside the key property inside my text field and I can also put this username controller right here okay now that we have the controller and also the form key I think we are able to continue and create a method right here I'm going to go inside the state and here I need to create a method called validate user uh validate username and this method is void it means that we are not retaining anything and inside this method I want to create this functionality to not all you users enter any similar username which is already inside my database so let me just create an instance of Firebase fir store and then I should go inside users collection and here I need to get everything inside this database and I'm going to just first of all I need to make this method as synr and await this now I should store it inside a variable called users map now that I have access to the users map I can just go ahead and I go and take all the docks and then I can use the map method and using this method I have access to every single user inside this collection and I want to return this user and finally change it to a list now I have a list of users so let me just store it inside this users variable now that we have a list of users I want to create a for Loop and check every single user inside the database and see if the there's a similarity between our username and the usernames inside database so what I can do is to create a for Loop I'm going to just say for user or user in users it means that we are going and checking every single user inside this users class this users list so when we checking it and I'm checking every single user inside this users list which is our database and here first of all I also want to have an string which I'm going to just call it targeted username and I can just give it something like I can make it initially equal to nothing it means I didn't need to give it value for now first of all I need to say user. data username this is the username from database it is every single username inside the database because we are using a for Loop so now now that we have access to every single user username inside the database I can go and check it to see if there is similarity if it's similar to my username that is typed inside the text field my username is called this username controller so let me just take this and I'm going to create a condition to say if username controller. text is equal to this username if that is the case it means if the uh if the username that is typed inside the text field is equal to every single username inside my database if that is the case it means that the username is already taken and in this case I don't want to allow user to continue so let me just create a a Boolean here I'm going to call it is validate and using this Boolean is validate uh it just allow us to keep track of validation and we can understand on which case the validation is false or true if that is the case it means that validation is not true so I'm going to put I'm going to change this is validate property equal to false and I'm going to do a c set also very well but I also want to make another condition because in the first condition we just saw uh we just uh told that if the username controller it means the username that that is typed inside the text field is similar to one of the usernames I want to make the validation false it means I I want all user to continue but what if the user changes the username when they see that they are getting error they want to change the username in this case I'm going to add another condition to say if the username controller the text it means the my username it is not equal to targeted username targeted username is the username that uh already was in our database and it was equal to my username I also need to add this inside my targeted username here this username that was inside my database if you got confused on while I was working I'm going to explain it once I'm done so don't worry a lot about it I'm saying that if the username controller. text it means the username that is typed inside the text field is not equal to the targeted username in this case all you want to make make the is valid property once again equal to true and also I'm going to do a set set once again and now we are done creating this validate username so let me just check uh let me just review it once quickly that what I've done inside this method first of all I just moved on to the collection of users and got everything inside this database and then I had this users map I use this map method to access every single user inside this database and change it to a list so now we have a list of users then I created a for Loop and I uh and I just told that go inside every single user in the list of users and now inside this forup we are checking that if the username that we are typing inside the text field is equal to user. data. username which is basically every single username inside our database so if our username is equal to every single username inside each one of the username I should say like this that if our username is equal to each of that usernames inside the database I don't want to allow user to continue so I'm going to uh make this as validate equal to false I don't want to allow user to continue because the validation is not true but I want to also make another condition to say if the user changes the username it means that if they uh changing the username that my username is not equal to that uh repeated username in that case I want to make is validate equal to true and I want to all user to continue this is basically all I did to create this validation now I need to put this method somewhere and I'm going to just put it inside the unchanged property in the text form field let me just find this text form field and here we have an unchanged property which takes an argument which is just our username if you wonder what is this unchanged uh property or I should say listener inside this text form field it is a list that triggers every time we release a key on the keyboard it means that whenever you start typing on the text form field this unchanged property will be triggering every time so I think this is the best place to add this valid username method so I'm going to just put this method here I also want to add another property which is validator it Al uh once again it takes the username and here we can change this as well and also I have Auto validate mode which I'm going to also change this one to always when I change this one to always it just allow us to see the changes real time and we don't need to wait to submit the button and in real time you can see the changes and the validation very well now everything should be good the final step is to change the UI based on validation I take this as validate property and I'm going to change some stuff based on whether the validation is true or or false the first thing that I need to change is this suffix icon so I'm going to say that if is validated is true I'm going to show this verified user rounded icon but if it is false I want to show a cancel icons I need to remove this const I also need to change the color based on whether we are uh able to continue or not so I'm going to say f is validate uh if is validate is equal to true I need to show I need to use a colors of green but if it is equal to false I want to show a color of red which basically just tells the user that something is wrong here okay I also need to change the background color of this flat button on whether we are uh the validation is true or false so let me just check it once again that if is validated equal to true I want to show a color of green but if it is equal false I want to show a color of red not red I mean something like uh green but with a shade of 100 that looks perfect it's something like white color we change the background color of this flat button I also need to change this onpress but not now I will do it later on when we add something inside that and I change the suffix icon color the suffix icon and I believe that is all I need to change on whether we are able to continue and we are validate to continue or we are not valid it okay that is okay for now let me just put some const here we are getting all these errors because my computer is not really working well right now that is why that these errors are not permanent it's just temporary errors because my computer is really slowing down right now okay right now let's go and work on the last step I need which is to add the user data inside the collection of users whenever we are pressing this button so as I already told you inside this username page the responsibility of this username page is not to only enter and allow user to enter the username the responsibility is to add the whole user's data inside the database inside this onpress property so I want to do this so let me just leave a comment to say add users data inside database so that is what you want to do inside this onpress and for doing it first of all I need to change this stateful widget to a consumer stateful widget we already saw how can we change an EST this widget to a consumer widget but right now we are seeing how can we do it to a stateful widget so let me just do it all you need to do is to just just add a consumer before this stateful widget and I'm going to just oh I'm going to just also import the flut package and I also need to do this before this state right here and also this one and once I do it the errors will be gone now I have this uh consumer stateful widget which allow me to use the ri and connect between all my providers inside flut River pot so now I'm going to use the Riff and then I'm going to use the read method and the provider that I'm going to using here is user data service provider and right now I'm able to use this add user data to fire store method as you can see we have some properties here that I need to initialize a display name username email description and profile picture so I have to initialize all of them uh about display name email address and also pfile picture I will pass them as parameters and I will just initialize them inside the men D so first of all let me just create them I'm going to create a final string display name final string perect pick and also final string display name profile picture and also I need an ml very well I'm going to just generate Constructor for them and now everything should be good okay very good now let's go to the bottom of the page and put that values inside this method for display name it is widget. display name also I'm going to do the same for email and exactly the same for profile picture very good about the username I can just use the username controller. text and also the description will be empty for now because whenever you're creating a new user it does not have a description but later on the person can just add a description on their own so first of all I'm going to just put this initially equal to empty now we have all this uh display name username email description and profile pictures and everything is good let me also just make this method as sign this and I wait this uh method now everything should be good and we should be able to add user data to the fire restore and as a final steps I also want to add this validation here I'm going to just say if is validate is equal to true I'm able to just uh run this method but if it is equal to false I'm going to just return a null it means that the user will not be able to uh use this add user data to F store when the validation is not true and also I'm going to do the same for the validator property here I'm going to just say return if is validate is equal to true in this case I'm going to just return null and what does null mean it means that it there's no problem but if it is equal to false it means that we are having some error I'm going to just return username already taken so I want to return this let me just explain what we did here inside the validator I uh first of all we have this username and here I'm going to just say if is validate is equal to true it means that there is no problem and we can just continue in this case I'm going to return a null it means that there is no problem but if the a Val is equal to false it means there is a problem and I'm going to return this text which is the exact exception to tell the user that the username already taken very well everything is good now I can just go on and continue whether it is working or not so let me just run the emulator once again ah of course we should have some error I forgot one step now I need to go inside the men do Dart and I need to add one more functionality right here so what we doing inside the men dot for now is just we are having an stram Builder and we are checking whether we are signed in or not using this special method or set changes and we are checking if you're signed in if we have not any data it means that we are not signed in I want to just return login page in other cases we are returning a username page but that is not all I want to do after I checked that I am signed in or not in the first condition which says if you're not signed in just return a login page I'm going to also put another condition which says if the data is loading I need to return a loader so I'm going to just say that if the snapshot that connection is set is equal to connection is said. waiting it means that the data is loading for now I'm going to just return a loader and if you wonder what is this loader it is a prebuilt widget I have created and it is just simply a size box with a height and width and also a circular progress indicator and of course you have access to it when if you have downloaded the starting project okay and the final thing that I want to do is to add a second stream Builder here and in the second stream Builder I want to check whether the user data is added to the fire resore or not let me just explain it real quick in the firstam Builder we are checking that if the user is signed in or not and if they are not signed in we are returning a login page if the data is loading you want to show a loader and if you are signed in I want to show another stream Builder and in the second stream Builder I want to check whether the data is added to the fire or not so you can just guess that in the Stream property I need to add something related to my database okay so let's just go and create an inance of Firebase firer I'm going to just move on to the collection of users the doc will be the uid of the current users uid so I'm going to just create a Firebase inance and then I'm going to use the Char user. uid and finally I need to use the snapshots you just know that whenever we using a stream Builders we always use this snapshots now inside the second stream Builder let's also check whether the data is added or not so I'm going to create some more conditions the first condition I'm going to just say if the snapshot. has data is not true or this is basically a sign in Dart programming language to say or or snapshot the data that exists is again not true if that is the case it means that the user data is not added to forer and in this case I'm going to just return the username pitch and I need to give a value to this uh display name Prof for picture and email as well so I just need to create an in of Firebase alt to say now now I have access to this current user which is basically the user that has signed in right now and I can just use its values so I'm going to just store it inside a variable called user and I can just use this user to initialize display name profile picture and also email the next one is profile picture and I'm going to use that as well it is a F URL I mean and also the final one is ml so in the first condition we are checking that if we do not have any data in this case I want to return the username page and we already know that inside the username page we add all the users data inside the users collection and our database in the second condition once again I'm going to check if there is the data is loading I want to return a loader so if the snapshot do connection instead is equal to connection instead. waiting in this case I'm going to just return a loader and finally if the snapshot that has data is not equal to false it means that the we have the data it is not loading in this case I'm going to just return the homepage so let me just uh review it once really quickly we have twoam Builders inside the main. inside the firstam Builder I'm checking whether we are signed in or not it means that I'm going to use this outstate changes method and I say if we are not signed in go to the login page if you are getting the data and it's loading just return a loader widget and finally when we have the data I want to return this stream Builder the second stream Builder in the second stream Builder I'm checking inside my users collection inside my database and I'm checking that okay I'm signed in but does the this user that has signed in uh has added the data to the fire sore or not so I'm going to check it right this that if the data is not added to the fire s I'm going to return a username page which all user to add the data and if it is loading return a loader and if you have the data and everything is done just return the homepage right now let me just run the project to see does it work or not right now we are inside the homepage because I have already signed in let me just uh close this uh project and I'm going to go and delete the whole project and right now I want to go and run the project once again very well as you can see when we open the app for the first time we get this login pitch and this is exactly in the firstam Builder that we don't have any data uh right here so we are having this login pitch when I click on the button we can sign in with Google uh first of all let me just uh connect to the internet because I forgot to connect it okay as you can see I have this two uh IDs these two accounts signed in let me just uh first of all open my database inside uh Firebase console okay this is my project and I'm going to just move on to the firestore database and I have already these two accounts these two users inside my collection but I want to just delete one of them okay right now inside my collection and users collection I have only one account it is the display name Ahmed amini and also the username Ahmed amini not capitalized so just keep this in mind because I'm going to check it right now let's get back to the emulator I'm going to sign in with my second account take Ahmed amini that I just removed it from my collection right now I'm going to just select this one and as you can see it is taking me to the username page let me just open vs code right now the authentication is done so the first Builder is done and now it just uh open the second stream Builder and because the user data is not added it open the username page right this one and now let's check the validation that it's working or not as you saw the username for the first account was Ahmed amini if I type the same username it should give me an error or should not allow me to continue so let me just type that one Ahmed amini and as you can see it's not working whenever I type a username which is already inside my database as you can see this is the username in my database it's giving me an error to say username already taken and right now if I click this it won't work because I said if the validation is false you should not all user to add the user data so I need to change this and when I change it I back uh again I can once again enter and continue the process okay I'm going to just type div coder this is going to be my username and right now I'm able to continue and when I hit continue I will be navigated to the homepage because when we have the data we want to show the homepage everything is working and it works perfectly fine now let's just move on to the next feature that you want to create in this project which is going to be the channel feature so as you can see inside the starting project I have already this channel feature inside which I have just a widget uh folder inside I have these two files the first one is the settings dialogue and also the second one is the settings item and of course if you have downloaded the storing project you have access to all of these files and folders and everything should be good to you so inside the channel folder I need to create two folders the first one is going to be for my channel and also the second one is going to be for the user channel so of course I could just created one single page for this but I'm not going to do that and I want to just have two separate files and Pages for my channel and also the user's Channel and it will make my life much easier and you will see how I'm going to do that and if you can just understand what I'm saying you will understand once I'm working on it so let's just uh create the first folder which is going to be my channel and the next one is going to to be the user Channel and basically I just want to put everything related to my channel inside this folder and everything related to the user Channel inside this folder and what I mean by the user's channel is every other channel but not my own channel which Inside by Channel I'm going to just show my own user it mean uh the carrying users data and inside the user Channel I'm going to show any other user channel that the user clicks on you will understand what I'm seeing later on when Once I'm working on it and and for now I'm going to just work on my channel and then when I finish on that I will work in the user Channel let me just also put this widget folder inside my channel which I'm going to need it and I can also create a new folder which I'm going to just call pages and I will put all the screens inside this folder but before working on a channel I need to work inside my homepage let me just uh go to the homepage and right here what I want to do is to display my profile picture inside the homepage that whenever someone comes to the homepage which is going to be the first page that appears whenever the user opens this YouTube colum uh the first page that they are going to see is this homepage and I want to show and display the profile picture right inside the homepage which when the user opens the app they can see that on which account they are signed in so first of all let me just uh open the emulator and run the project okay the project is running and as you can see the first page that I'm seeing is this homepage and I want to just create this circle Avatar inside which I will show the perfect picture right here next to this search icon so let me just work on it and and what I'm going to do is let me just close this extra tabs that we can see the vs code properly and work good and after this padding widget inside which I show an image button of search I just want to go ahead and create a circle water and inside that I can just show the purple picture of the current user who has signed in and I will just give it a radius of something like 15 and also a background color of gray for now and this is what we have and I can also wrap it with a padding widget let me just resize this V Cod that you can see emulator properly and I will put it right here and like this very well I'm going to just wrap this circle of water with a padding widget and I will give it a padding from the right side which is going to be a padding of eight and now it should look much beautiful and and I can just increase this padding to something like 12 and now it should be much better okay the next I want to display my profile picture inside of the circle water so whenever the user signs in and they will see this homepage for the first time they should see their profile picture which is going to be the current user profile picture inside the circle water so let's just work on it and for doing it I need to create a consumer widget so up to now we have saw we have seen that how can weate create I mean how can we convert a stess widget into a consumer widget and using this consumer widget we can just listen to all changes to a specific provider and change the UI based on that provider and all the values but not only we are able to just change like this stad lless widget into a consumer widget I'm also able to just create a consumer widget in some parts of this stad widget I mean that I don't have to just convert the whole stad widget into a consumer widget I can just create one inside the file let me just do it like this I can just create a consumer widget which is just a very simple widget which comes from the FL package and H and now it has a builder property and right here I can just return whatever I want so let me come like this and then I have access to this riff and we basically know that using this riff I can do anything and connect my consumer budget to provider that I want to so let me just use this RI and then the watch method and right here I need to use a provider to get to just fetch me the current users data so how can I do it I need to create that method and also that provider so I want to create it inside this authentication uh feature let me just go inside the repository and then user data service and inside this user data service as you can see we have the first method add user data to the fire store so this is the first first method that allow us to add the data but not only we want to add the data but we also want to fish the data back so let me just create the second method and fet the data from the fire store and I'm going to just call it fetch current user data and of course it's going to be an inchron method and here I can use the fire store and go inside the collection of users and the do and the document ID is just going to be the U ID of the current user uh account so I'm going to just use the a current user and uid and finally I'm going to get back all the data that I get from this collection and I can just store it inside a variable which I can just call it current user map now I want to convert this map into a user model so we already have a user model so I'm going to use this and I can just use um I can use a method called from map that we already created inside this user model so let me just go inside as you can see we have two methods to map and also from map that we just uh generated using the sterilization and using these two special methods to map and from map I can add and also fed the data from firer we already saw that how we added the data to fire using two map but now we are getting back the data from the from map so I just use the from map method from this user model and now I need to provide a map which is going to be the current user map. data so now we have the data and I can just return this user which is a type user model I'm going to also specify what we are returning from this uh method which is going to be a future of user model very well now that I have the method I also want to create a provider for this one and I can just go ahead and create the first folder called provider inside this authentication and I can just create this first and also the last provider that we have here which is going to be a future provider of current user provider so I can just call it user provider and here I need to create a future provider up to now we also only a simple provider and using that provider we were able to connect different providers we use drift use CER widgets but above that I'm also able to just create a future provider future provider is just an alternative to Future Builder which we have in flut SDK itself and it's a much more useful way which makes our code maintainable and readable and also organizable so I just uh can say that future provider is much better uh Choice than a future Builder from the FL SDK and we can just simply create it like any other provider I'm going to just uh first give it a name like current user provider and then I can just specify the type of Provider which is in this case a future provider and as you can see we already have this riff and what I want to do is to just use this Riff to find the method that I just created inside user data service this fetch user uh this fetch cing user data so let me just use this R and then the watch method and then the provider that I need to use just guess it which provider it's the current user data I mean it's user data service provider if you remember it and then I can just use the fish current user data provider and I'm going to also make this method asnr and await this and finally I can just insert it inside a variable of type user model which I'm going to just call it user and I'm going to return this user let me also import this user model and I will also just specify the type of this feature provider which in this case user model here we just specify that we are returning a user model from this future provider so now let me just use this current user uh provider which is a type feature provider and I'm just going to paste it here and import it and here I have access to a special method called win and what is this win it is all us to just organize our code based on different situations like if you have the data if you're having an error and what if if the data is loading so we can just handle the data and show it to the UI based on different scenarios and first of all let me just specify Y what if we have loading I just want to show a loader page and of course we have this inside the starting project and the next if there is an error I'm going to just return this error page again we have this inside the starting project and when we have the data actually I want to return this portol picture which is going to be this circle Avatar so let me just copy it and now I'm going to paste it right here and the data is going to be just the current user in this case and everything is good I also need to return this riff and put accounts here so everything is good and what we are saying is basically we have a consumer widget to just listen to our providers and change the UI based on different values and then I'm going to return this r. watch and we use this current user provider which is a type future provider and we are just saying that when we have an error we want to show this error pitch if the data is loading we want to show a loader and when we have the actual data I just want to show a per I mean I just want to show a circle aor inside which I want to just uh show the background image so I'm going to just use the cached Network image provider and the URL is going to be current user do powerfold picture let me just remove this Con and everything should be good very well and now we should be able to see our own Prof Prof picture the current user profile picture inside the homepage using this consumer widget so let's check it we have this error let me just uh terminate the project and run it once again as you can see the data is loading and while loading it shows me uh a circle uh indicator because it's loading the data on one it data is loaded it shows me the profile picture and this is the current user's profile picture and everything is working fine now that we are done with the homage I can just get back to the channel feature and start creating my pages and everything inside this folder so first of all I need to create a file for the my channel screen so let me just create this file real quick which I can just call it my channel screen and inside this file I just want to show everything related to my channel basically what I want to create is just uh a page inside which I want to show all my the current users data which is going to be my peral picture display name username number of subscriptions and videos and also a tab bar and a tab view so I just want to create this so let's go ahead and do it I need to uh import this material. Dart and then I can just create this status fidget which I'm going to just call it my channel screen so now let's create this scaffold inside of which we have a body and just like always a safe area the child is a padding the padding is going to be just from for now only from the top side which I'm going to give it a padding of 12 I mean 20 and also the child is going to be a column so now inside this column first of all let me just give a cons to this scaffold inside this column the first thing that I want to create is a circle a and I want to just show my profile picture inside the circle of water and I will give it a radius of 34 a background color of something like gray and I will also show the background image but for now I'm not going to do it let me just run the project that we can see what we have so far okay we are again inside this homepage so for now I'm going I'm going to just change the men Dart and instead of the homepage I just want to show my channel and it's not going to be last forever because once I'm done and I have created some of the pages I will just convert this into the home screen and I will put the my channel screen uh on the wherever it's needed but it's just going to going to be for now that I can just uh show you that how I'm creating this page and again I'm going to just minimize this WIS that you can see properly the emulator okay let's just go ahead and create this my channel screen and the first thing I need to change this main access alignment to Center that I can just Center this actually not like this so I'm not going to do this and instead I'm going to just wrap this circular water with the center vet and now we have this right here I can also increase this uh to something like 38 that it gets much bigger after this circle AAR I want to show something like a display name and for doing it I just need to create a text and for now my displ name is going to be Ahmed amini let's also change the styling of this text we will have a f size of something like 24 f Way of buold and that's all for now this is what we got I can also increase this phone size actually to something like 27 that it gets much bigger I'm it 26 the next I want to create a rich text so inside this Rich text what I want to create is basically I want to show the username number of subscriptions and also number of videos inside this rich first of all let me just remove this const and put it right here right here and right here and here I need to create a text text is pan and it has a children and I'm going to create three children for it one is going to be for the username the next one for number of subscriptions and final one is for number of videos so let me just create them the first one is going to be my username so I can just call something like ahmar Das amini I can also just copy and paste it some more times some two times more and the next one is going to be for number of subscriptions and initially it's going to be equal to no subscriptions because whenever the user creates account for the first time there is no subscriptions and also there is no videos so I'm going to just write like this as you can see nothing is displaying into the emulator and the reason is that I haven't changed the text Style and right now the color is just something like white and you can't see it so let me just change the styling here we are going to have a color of like blue gray and let's see how does it look like it looks good let me just also add some spaces right here and now it should look much better and finally I also want to add a text here to say just more about this channel just like the actual YouTube and I just need to add some padding to this as you can see it's not really looking very nice so I need to add some padding to it and first of all I'm going to just wrap this text for display name and wrap it with a padding of course first of all I'm going to give it a padding from the top side a padding of 10 and also from the bottom side I can give it a padding of like maybe four and that's it it looks nice the next I also can wrap this Rich text with a padding and I will give you the padding only from the bottom side and it will be something like nine and I hope it looks beautiful I think it does so let me just put a con right here and also write here so now I have this I have a c I have a display name I have this username subscriptions videos and also this text at the bottom then next I want to create uh actually some uh buttons right here which is going to be for the managing videos and also uh navigating to some other pages and it's exactly the same like we have in actual YouTube colog Let me just go ahead and create this so first of all I need to create a container and inside this container I want to create my button first of all let me let me just give it a decoration it has a colors of like gray for now and I'm I'm going to also give it a border radius which is going to be B radius from the old sides and it will be circular to something like nine and I hope it looks nice and I need to give it a child that we can actually see this container and the child of this container is going to be a text button and this text button has an onpress which is for now just empty and also it has a text to say manage videos let me just change the UI because it really doesn't look very uh beautiful for now let me just change the textel of this one and give it a color of like black and then I can just uh give this gray color a shed of 300 and now it should be like this after that I also want to create two more buttons in a row just side by side to this manage videos button and these two buttons are going to be the type image button first of all let me just take this container and first I want to have a row inside the row I want to have this container I'll say two more image buttons and if you just want wonder that what is this image button uh I should say that it is a preu fidget that I have already created and of course it's inside the starting project and basically it's just a padding widget it has a g detector to uh just check this on top and here we have just a container inside which I have used an asset from the asset folder in my project and it's very useful having this image button first of all it has an onpress of course it's going to be empty for now and also we have an image a half color which is going to be true for now and this image is going to be something like pin.png let me just check it this is the icon that I have created I'm going to just copy this one more time and the next icon I mean the asset is going to be just time watched. PNG and as you can see this is the second icon having this SI about changing the size of this but S I can just wrap them with expanded widget first of all starting from this container I'm going to just wrap it with expanded vidget and I will give it a flex of three and this F just specify the size of this child of this expanded widget I'm going to also just wrap this two B two more bottons with expanded fidget I'm not going to just specify the legs and this is the final one and as you can see it looks much beautiful right now I just need to change the height of this manage videos button so let me just come here inside the container I can just change the height property to something like maybe 40 and I need to give it something like 44 I believe or it should be like 41 I have it matches and I think that's perfect I don't need to change it anymore I also want to get that color from this image button you know the color of this button is just something like soft blue background let me just implement this inside the manage vide Button as well and instead of this we can just have this one and I will also have to import it and this soft blue uh this soft blue gray background is just a color which I have already created inside this files colors and of course it's inside the instarting project and it's going to be very useful throughout this project these colors so now we have everything and as you can see this is how it looks like I just need to wrap this row with a padding and give it a padding from the top side so let me just do it we will have a padding from the top side and it's going to be a padding of 10 I believe so I can just increase the uh I mean this pading to something like 16 which makes it much more beautiful okay let's go to the final part which is going to be adding a tab bar and a tab bar view here so first of all I'm going to just add a tab bar here so let me just scroll down and outside of this row and a padding I can just create the tab bar I also do a comment here can understand that I have created a tab bar right here and I have can I can just use the P belt widget from the flutter itself which is the tab bar and to use this tab bar and tab bar view inside flutter first of all you need to have a controller and I'm going to just use the default controller so what I can do is to just take all this scaffold let me just take all of them and I need to return first of all a default tab controller and using this default tab controller I can just specify like I want to have seven tabs here and the child is going to be just my whole project now I can use this tab bar to create it and the first and the only I mean the only required parameter inside this tab bar is a tab so you need to have just specify all the tabs that you want to create and tabs that I want to create the first one is the home let me just copy and paste it some more times I want to have seven tabs so I'm going to just need to create six more of these tabs the next one is videos the next one is shorts community playlists channels and the final is about so this is just extra I'm going to remove it and now we have this t board but when I see the emulator it's really not looking very beautiful so I need to change some properties inside this tabbo to make it much more beautiful and the first one which is more important is this is scrollable right now that it's looking like this it's because it's not scrollable and makes it it will look like this but if I just uh change this scrollable to true now it looks like this which is much more beautiful but I'm going to also add some more properties uh some more properties to this stb to make it much more beautiful further than this uh first of all let's just add a label style which is going to be the type text style and I will just change the F size to 15 and I also want to just give it a f w of w500 so I will just use this fway 500 I will also want to change the indicator size so let me just change it real quick and the indicator size is going to be just the tab bar indicator size. level good and the indicator padding is the next property which I'm going to just give it a padding from the top side and 12 very good I believe that's enough for now and if it's necessary I'm going to also add some more properties to this tab bar and right now it should be much more beautiful I just need to just wrap the whole tab bar with a padding to give it a padding from the bottom I mean from the top side and I would have a padding of like 14 in from the top side okay and this is what we got for now and I believe it's much more beautiful now that we have this tab bar let's also add a tab bar view which is basically the pages that we need uh inside each tab as you can see if I scroll between different tabs right now nothing changes there's no Pages let's add that one as well so just above this padding and tab bar I can just create this tab bar View and it got a children property which is required and I just need to add seven children for each of these tabs that we have so let's just create them one by one I'm going to just create a center vet which has a child of this text which is going to be again the same names that we had before and I will just copy it six more times that we can use in this tab view the next one is going to be videos shorts community playlist Channel and the final one is going to be about very good now let me just do it a cons here and right now uh let me just wrap this tab view with expanded widget we got some UI error now everything should be good and when I just scroll into different tabs the page changes now I'm inside the video use tab and the shorts Community playlist and everything so on and so forth so now it's looking much more beautiful so I believe that we have a really good UI till now so before going into the logic and adding the logic to actually display the actual data of the current user let me just uh modify and organize my code as you can see there are a lot of code inside this page we have 152 lines of code and I leave it some it's somehow messy so I'm going to just put some of this uh you know widgets inside a different file and it's going to be parts of this file let me just show you what I really mean first of all we have all these widgets from starting from the circle lator up to this more about this channel up to this right here and it's all about the users data like perfect picture display name username and everything so I can just uh you know add it inside a separate file which is going to be my vidget top header because it's the top header of my page so I'm going to just go let me just close this off and inside my channel I can add a new folder which I can just call parts and inside this folder I will put the different parts of my pages like my channel screen pages I divide them into different parts and put it right here which makes my code much morean organizable and the first file is as I said is going to be top header let me just UT the material the dart create an status widget which I'm going to just call it top header widget actually it's not a widget it's just top header because it's part of my screen and here at first I'm going to just return a colum and then I can paste all the quit right here now inside this my channel screen instead of all that good I can just you know use this top header right here just import it and use it right inside the my channel screen and as you can see the UI is just exactly the same there's no changes and I can exactly do the same to this you know tab bar and tab bar view let me just copy this on a as well this tab bar and right here I can create a new file which I can just call it tab bar and here I'm going to just call it tab bar widget again not widget you know I can just call it page tab bar and I will just paste it inside this instead of this placeholder very good now let me just use it inside this screen and the final one is going to be just this tab bar view a new file which I can just call it uh Tabb bar View and I can just call it page know tabs and actually let me just rename this to top pages you know it gives more meaning to say top pages and I can just return this one as well right here and let me just use it inside my channel screen and that's it now my code is much more recognizable I have a tab pages right here I have a tab bar and also I have some buttons here and here I also have this top header actually I can just put this buttons as well inside a separate file so it's starting from this padding up to right here I can just copy all the code and create a new part which is going to be buttons again UT the material. dart create an status fidget which I'm going to call it buttons and that's it of buttons here just return a column and inside this column I can have all this widgets you have to import this one as well and now we don't have any error also import this one very good and now I can use this buttons right here and as you can see uh let me just remove this const because I can just put a const the whole page right now and as you can see right now the code is much more organized I have a my channel screen here I have a top header which I just show my uh user data I have but which I have three buttons inside the row I have a tab a page tabbo and also tab pages and as you can see the UI is exactly the same and there is no difference here now that you are done here let me just add the most important part it means adding the actual data from server and placing just inside this different widgets so what I want to do right now is to use that future provider that I just created and add the data and put the data inside different widgets in this screen and to do that I can just change the whole St widget to a consumer widget and as you know I have to add a widget RI into the the belt function okay right now instead of returning this default tab controller let me just take everything I need to use this rev and then I can use the watch method to watch a method and what I'm going to just watch is the current user data provider which you already know that it's a future provider let me just hover over it and you can see it's a type future provider of a user model and now once again like we just saw inside the homepage I can just use the the win method which is a special method which again allow me to handle situation on different cases like the data error and loading and we're exactly going to do the same once again again if we have the loading I just want to show a loader pitch if we got any error I just want to show an error pitch and finally when we have the data I just want to show everything which I had really good and as you can see the data is the current user once again using this current user I can just put the actual data inside each of these pages first of all I'm going to go inside this top header and create a parameter here which is going to be the type user model and I can just place this user model into actual qu first of all let me just change the circle aor and we have a background image once again I'm going to use this cached Network image provider and I can use the user. purple Peck to add the value right here remove the cons and everything should be good the next one is the display name I can again use this user. display name to show the display name of the current user the next one is going to be for the username number of subscriptions and also videos let me just place them each one of them user do username this is the first one the next one is number of subscriptions so I can just say once again user. subscriptions and after that I'm going to just say it is number of subscriptions just to tell the users that it's about subscriptions because this one is just giving us it's just giving us a number like if the subscriptions is equal to zero which is which is equal to zero initially it will just give us a zero but I also want to show subscriptions which just tell the user that it's about subscriptions and the next one is about videos so I can just say user videos and videos okay now inside my channel screen I have this error because it wants this user which is going to be equal to current user let me just remove this const okay and let me just check what we have as you can see I have this data actually my display name is not really looking very nice but the other information is good the information is completely correct this is my display name which I'm going to just change it this is the username diff coder this is number of subscriptions which is giving me an empty list so let me just change it real quick I don't want to have a list I want to have the actual data so I can use this user. subscriptions do length actually and it will just give me the number of uh length of this list of subscriptions and right now it's giving me zero subscriptions and zero videos so everything is perfectly working fine and we have shown all the data inside this page the next I also need to create a new page for settings Channel I need to create a page which I inside that I can just change some of the settings inside my screen like display name username description and all of this I need to be able to change it on as well so first of all let me just close all the saved pages and then I can just go and create a new page which is called channel settings just import the material. dart and create an status fidget called my channel settings okay that's great the next I need to have a scapel just like always and then inside the body I want to have a sephara inside which I want to have a padding and once again we'll have a padding only from the top side which is going to be a pading of 20 and then inside the child I have this column okay everything is good up to now so now inside this column I want to create my settings Channel which is going to be just first of all I need to show once again the profile picture inside a circle a and then I can show my display name username and description and here we don't want to just display this information we want to be able to change this information so I want to enable user to edit the users data like users will be able to edit username edit display name and edit this description so let's just create each one of them uh the first I just need to create actually an stack widget okay first of all ins the children I can create an asset image and it's going to be inside the assets and the first one is the flut background.png let me just run the emulator once again and we can see how does it look like I will just once again minimize this V code that you can see inul lat and I just need to go to men. Dart and again because we are working on the UI I will change this my channel screen to the screen that I am building which is going to be channel settings okay great now inside here the first thing that I had to show was a flut background and actually it's not inside the assets it's inside assets and then images and then I have this asset flut background.png and I just want to show this as a background image for my uh project and my channel and first of all let me just remove this uh you know padding because we don't need to have a padding from the top side side and it's just want to be just stick to the top of the pitch about the height I also need to change the height of this asset image so let me just wrap it with a size box and change the height to something like 200 pixel or should I make it just smaller to something like 170 and I just need to change the fit property inside this image to box fit do cover and it will just cover the whole page for me first of all let me also change the WID to double do infinity and now everything is great then inside this background I also want to add my perect picture right at this you know at the center of this background right here I want to show my perect picture so I can just create another widget inside this stack uh widget which I'm going just create a circle AAR inside which I want to show my profile picture the radius is going to be just something like 20 background color gray and it's like that and I'm going to just wrap it with a position to change the position of this circle AAR I will give it a position from the left side I want to have a padding or I can say a distance of 50 pixel let me add some more like 120 you can just uh use trials and errors to find the perfect spot for yourself and also I'm going to do the same for the top which is going to be first of all 80 or it's a lot let me just use 65 and that's perfect I will also uh change this bar you know the radius of the Circ water to 30 I want to make it bigger and change this to XD and right now I maybe it's okay and you can as I said you can just use trials and errors to find the perfect spot the perfect place for the circle over here it's all about what we did and right now it's just a blue gray uh right now it's just a gray color but later on I will add the profile picture right inside the circle over and actually I also want to add a camera image right here I need again this position and the child is going to be an asset image once again and I will use assets and then I will go inside icons and then I'm going to use this camera.png it's an icon which I have inside my access folder and it's the icon that I need first of all let me just change the height to something like 30 maybe I want to make it much smaller uh something like 38 or 34 that should be perfect and I can also change the color to white and finally I just need to change the position so I wanted the position to be something like it has a 10 pixel distance from the right side or should I increase it to 60 and also I want it to have some distance from the top something like 20 maybe that's great or maybe 10 and that's now I believe beautiful and later on we can use this to change the profile picture and we will see how we can do it okay this was the top of my page the next I want to add some more stuff to this page which is going to be uh some item widgets in which I can just change my display name my username and also description and it's all about the V that I have here so I have this settings item I believe I can use this settings item to just create that rows which allow me to change display name and username and everything so let's use the settings item let's get back to the channel settings and write after the Stag widget inside the column uh I'm going to just write a comment to say the second part which just specify for me that where are we right now and right here I will create this settings item and of course import it and as you can see it has some required parameters and I identifier onpress and value the identifier for the for the first one is going to be just name because we're creating a name the onpress is going to be just empty for now and the value is going to be something like ah I mean my name actually my display name and this is created right here I want to create some more of this so let me create this one as well the second one is going to be for the username so I will give it it I I will give it an identifier of handle and my username is going to be Ahmed amini it's just hard Cod it now and the last one is about description and description is going to be empty for now because when users create their account for the first time they have no description but later on they can add their description and we will add this functionality as well now let me just add some size box between them and it has a height of something like 60 maybe or 14 that's going to be completely enough for this one so now we have this name handle and description and it's looking I believe beautiful I just need to add add an a size box right here as well because I wanted to have some distance from the top of the pitch so right now everything is correct and I also want to add some more widgets at the end of this column which is going to be the first one a row let me just create a row as children and inside this children I can first of all create a text to say keep all my subscribers private I'm just creating this because it's actually inside the actual YouTube and the next I also want to create a switch uh widget and the value is for now true and it has an unchanged which has the value and I will just say why what is the switch and how can we use it actually this is the switch I just want to be able to have this one as well in my project say uh keep all my subscribers private and users can just change this pattern or this switch true or false they can change it and for doing it first of all let me just have the full screen uh instead of just putting it true and as the value of the switch I can actually make it more Dynamic first of all let me just change this this widget this stess wiget into a stateful vget and then I can create a Boolean just called uh I can call this bran as something like uh is Switched I'm going to call it like this and initially it will be equal to false because we don't want this switch to be true initially and then instead of this true I can just give it this value of this Boolean which is a switched and whenever this unchanged property inside the switch triggers that means whenever the user changes this switch I want the value of this unchanged to go inside the is switch so I will put and insert the value of a value which is the value of this switch inside the is switch and uh later on I can just do a c set everything should be perfectly fine and let me also change the UI of this uh first of all I need to give it a main AIS alignment to space between and I can just wrap it with a padding widget from the left Ed and also from the right it will be it and that's looking perfectly fine okay that's great and the last I also want to add a text at the end of my page at the bottom of my page so let me create a text here to just say changes made on your names and profile pictures are visible only to YouTube and not other Google services so it's just a text that we already have in the actual YouTube so I'm going to just add it here there is no purpose for adding it but I just want it to be or I can say it want I want it to have a more beautiful UI so I add this one as well uh as this just this text I just need to change the text align and also give it some padding so first of all let me just give it a text align which is going to be text align do Center and I will also wrap this with a padding a padding from the left I can see just a padding symmetric and horizontal 10 and this is actually how it looks like I will also change the background color I mean the color of this T so let's just change the style and I will give it a color of something like gray and not actually gray but I can give it a color of blue gray I believe this is more beautiful and everything is per perfectly fine it's great let me just give it also a vertical padding and give it a a padding of 4 in or I just just increase it to something like 20 okay this is my settings Channel page inside which I can just change my display name my user name and also the description the UI is complete now and what I can work on right now is just the adding the logic and functionality to see the profile picture right here and then be able to change and edit this username this will name and everything so before this we saw that how can we convert an set this fidget into a consumer vget and we also saw that how can we create a consumer widget inside an scaffold without just changing all the whole St list or stold widget but now I want to convert a stateful widget into a consumer widget and for doing it you just need to uh you know add a consumer before a stateful vet and then let me just import this FL R part to this file and then copy consumer you also need to paste it right here before this set here and also here and right now the all errors are gone and you can just use a consumer inside your stateful widgets and you don't have to just create a riff by yourself because you already have access to this RI let me just show it somewhere for example inside this I can just have access to this R and I can use for example this red method it's already M for me so now let's go and create the logic to first of all add the current user data first of all for this you know P for picture because I wanted to show it right there and also there and there so once again like I did before I can just take the whole scaffold let me just take the whole scaffold and I can use ref doat and once again I'm us using the current user data provider and using this way method if the data is loading I will show a loader also for the error one I will show an error page and when we have the data I actually want to show all this widgets and everything here okay so now this data is once again the current user and I can just use it to display my data first of all I need to change the background image of this circle aor I will create this background image once again using this cached Network image provider and the URL is going to be the current user. profile picture let me just remove this cons and everything is good it should show and as you can see this is my profile picture and it's showing well right here the next I also want to change my display name right here let me just take this and use the current user do display name the next one is the username so I will do exactly the same but I will change the display name to username and the next one is about descriptions I will again use this one but description okay I believe everything is done so I have my perer picture my display name username and also this descriptions and it is done but the next I want to be able to edit this what I mean is whenever the user clicks on this pen uh button whenever the user click on it they should be able to just you know change or edit their display name username and descriptions so how can I do it inside this onpress for the first one is going to be the display name so let's add how can we just edit display name I need to create this so I will have a comment here so let me just create a new folder called repository inside inside my channel and here I need to create create a file which is going to be just maybe edit fields. Dart and right here I can just create a class called edit settings fil and again I need to have access to the Firebase fire and also Firebase off let me just create them the first one is Firebase firer so I will have an inance of fire Reser and the next one is going to be for the Firebase o and then I can just generate Constructor for it the first method inside this class is going to be the edit display name of course it's an inst method and here we want to be able to edit the display name and I need this display name as a parameter here so I'm going to just write display name it will be used as parameter and what I want to do is to just go inside the fur and then the collection of users the doc is going to be just the current user uid so I'm going to use the alt. current user uid and then I will just update and what I want to update is the display name because we want to edit that field so I'm going to just go inside display name and I want to just update it to the new display name which is going to be this display name which we have as parameter let me just create uh some more of this because so I need to do the same for a username and also descriptions the next one is going to be edit username and also we have the edit description here we have the username and also the username here we have the description okay everything is perfect okay let me just create a provider out of this and again it's going to be just a simple provider and we already know that how can you create this providers this is going to be just called edit settings provider again equal to simple provider and I can just return this edit settings filed I just need to initialize this firer and also Fest out okay everything is right and now I can just use this edit settings provider to access this class okay now I want to just use this to uh you know create this functionality to edit the display name and here I can use my second widget which I already created which is is going to be the settings dialogue so whenever this uh onpress is triggered first of all I want to show a dialogue and then inside the Builder I want to return this settings dialogue okay it's great and as you can see inside the settings dialogue I have an identifier let me just see what I need to do I have to go and get to that edit fils provider and then I can access to this edit display name actually so I want to have this method and when do I really need to use the this display name is whenever yeah we have an identifier which I can just give it something like display name and the next property is just onsave and this onsave has a display name and this like this and right here I can use this RI to edit display name and this uh parameter that I need to fill inside this Ed display name which is my display name the new display name is going to be just this name and everything is working perfectly fine and if you just get confused that what I I what I exactly did here I'm going to just uh go through it once again so don't worry before that let me just finish these two adds for the the username and also description as well and then I'm going to just uh tell you that what I did let me just copy everything and I will paste the same for the username but I just need to change this to username I need to use this edit username again username and also change this one to username okay and I will also do the same for the description I just need to change this to description this one and also this one okay now it should be working so let's see what exactly we did first of all I just created this uh settings dialogue which is it shows it's just a dialogue it's just an alert dialogue when whenever we click on the botton I want to show an alert dialogue and say if you really want to just edit that and inside this alert dialog I have an identifier which is specify whether it's a display name a username or a description and then I have a text field which inside this text field the user is able to enter the new uh display name user usern name of description and I just get access to that using this controller and finally I have this uh you know cancel button which just navigate back and also the save button which allow me to just save everything and and I just pass this save uh function as a parameter to this channel settings page so what I'm doing here is basically to say first of all whenever this button is clicked show me a dialogue and then return the settings dialogue which the identifier for here is displaying it and then I have this unsave method whenever the user clicks on Save I want to access this name so this name is the exact new name that the user uh has entered inside the text field and I just get access to this name and I just call this provider edit settings and then I use the edit display name and as you saw here I just go inside the collection of users on the uid of the current user I just update the current display name the current username and also the current descriptions so this is all I did inside this page and now I have to test it out whether it's working or not so let me just run the project yeah it's already running so let me just do a h restart so as you can see we have this one my profile picture display name and everything and when I click on this button it gives me something like dialog and I can just enter for example my new display name which is going to be ahmar amini okay and when I click save now it has to change my display name so let me just do a hot Resort because it's not a stream it's a future it's not changing instantly but it should be changed yeah and as you can see this is my new display name and I can also do the same for the username and also for the description so let me just give it a new description for example hello world I am Ahmed amini okay let me just do a save once again and after doing a hot restart the description should be edited and this is my new description Hello World I'm Ahmed so everything is working now I have my channel and I have my channel settings and I'm able to edit my properties inside the current user I'm able to edit display name I'm able to edit username and also description as I said at the beginning of the course we have we will have a lot of homeworks throughout this tutorial and here I'm going to give you the first to homeworks the first homework is going to be you have to change this you have to create this ability and this feature that user can change the profile picture as well so as you saw I have created this uh little uh camera icon I want you to create this feature that whenever the user clicks on this button they should be able to pick a new image and change their profile picture I want you to do this and the second homework is going to be very easy you just need to add a validation to this username as you saw at the authentication feature whenever the user wants to create create a username uh we check whether the username is unique or not so all the validation that you saw already I want you to create the same validation in this part as well that whenever the user tries to addit username they should also check uh they should also be checked that if the username is validate or not so I want you create this two features and this is going to be your first homeworks and I hope that you can do it well now I want to also change this uh text it's not looking very nice let me just change it to identifier I want it to be something like your new display name and I will do the same for the this one as well I want to change to your new username and also for this one know your new description now let me just do a hot restart and when I click on this it says your new display name and I'm able to change it and if the UI is if you believe that the UI is not looking very nice maybe at the end I also change the UI more and you can also do it yourself to change the UI appropriately like the way you want it to be I'm not going to go any further so in the previous tutorial we saw how can we create uh the my channel page and we also added every logic and everything necessary to that uh creating of my channel and right now I want to just focus on creating user channel so we already have this folder right here and I'm going to just go ahead and create the pages first of all and inside that I have only one page which is going to be user Channel page so what you want to create inside this page is something really similar to my channel I'm going to just show a background image of flut background and then I will show profile picture display name username number of subscriptions and videos but the way that I format this data will be a little different than I did in my channel and also I will have a subscribe button which inside whenever a user clicks on that subscribe button we will be able to subscribe the user that we are inside the channel and also at the bottom of the page I will show the users videos so uh any video that the user or the channel has uploaded will be shown on their profile and this is what exactly I want to create so let's work on it and also remember that uh for now I will not work on the logic and I will not show the actual data of the user Channel because up to now we didn't have that provider or repository and whenever I create the search screen which after creating it I will be able to click on a user click on a channel and then I'll be navigated to this page so in that case I can actually show the data of this page but for now it will be just hardcoded let's create this status wiget and I'm going to just call it user Channel p page and just like always I will just use a scaffold inside the body I can just create a safe area child padding let me just give it a padding from the top side okay and the child is going to be just a column like always okay so now first of all the first fidget inside this column is going to be just once again an image. asset which I can just show uh I can go inside the images and then I can just use this flut background that we already used in the my channel page as well and I'm going to use this one right here as well let me just uh run the emulator that you can see how it's looking surely we will see the my channel page right here because I have put it inside the m. Dart but for now I'm going to again change this to user Channel and you notice that I'm going to just do it as a test mode uh it's only in a test mode because I want you to see how this UI of different pages looking but at the end it will be just showing here the homepage and I will create all the userflow necessary for this application so as you can see this is what we have let me just resize this V that you can see it properly and we can C faster like this and I will just remove actually let me just close this extra pages actually all the pages are extra except this one and I will close all of them uh let me just remove this padding because we don't need it right now uh I can just actually remove this padding widget and I believe it's okay and this is the background image after the background image I want to show my profile picture display name and everything so let me just create the row and inside the children first of all I will create a circle Avatar with a radius of like 30 and also a background color of gray and then after the circle a water I want to have a column so basically inside this column I want to create my display name first of all so let me just write this one Hamad amini which is going to be my display name and also after that I can have just my username and finally I want to use a rich text uh basically I just want to create my subscriptions and videos inside this Rich Text okay let me just uh ref format discode and right here first of all I will create uh the first text which is going to be for subscriptions so I will just say no subscriptions and I will also create one for videos which I can just say no videos okay that's great and this is how it looks like let me just give it a color because right now it doesn't have a color you can't see it and I will just give it a color of like blue gray let's see what's the problem here yeah I need to change it to style and basically I have put it in the wrong place I should do it right here so this is what we got up to now we got a circle aat and then we have display name username subscriptions and everything but of course it's not looking very nice so let me just work on to uh make it more beautiful first of all I will increase the radius of this circle Avatar something like 38 it might be beautiful and you know I can just uh give this Row first of all a padding from the both side so I will give it a padding from the left side 12 and also from the right side 12 now it looks better and also I will give it a padding from the top SL which is going to be a pattering of like 20 then I can just uh uh make this text a little bigger first of all let me just put a cons here and then I will also change the style of this display name and I would give it a frint size of something like 24 and also a Fint way of Bol and the next one is this usern name let me just go inside I will just copy everything from this one but I won't really touch this F size I will give it a f size of turn actually I want to make it a smaller and this one is going to be like this okay and I will also give it a color like a color of blue gray may be beautiful yeah that's great and I can just copy the same text style for this one as well and right now it's looking much more beautiful right let me just put some cons here MH and inside this column or I should say I want to bring this usern name at starting of this column inside this column I can just change this cross access alignment to something like start and right now it's great and let's give it you know a padding from I need to give a padding to this display name username and also this number of subscriptions first of all let me just add a padding to this column and it will be just a padding from the left side I believe and I will give it a padding of like 12 and I believe it nice so this is going to be our page we have a circle aatar we have a display name username number of subscriptions and videos let me just also create some spaces here between this new subscriptions and new videos okay that's great the next I want to add a subscribe button in which we will be able to subscribe this uh particular user so let me just create this one as well outside of this padding outside of this row I will just go ahead and create a flat button and this t should be just something like subscribe all capitalized the unpress is going to be empty for now because I didn't have anything to write but later on I will fill it out and I will make user be able to just subscribe user when they click on this particular button and let me just uh make this column cross access alignment equal to stretch okay and it will just make wider this flat button at the end of my page and I can just give it some padding as well first of all from the top side a padding of 20 and also maybe I can give it a padding from the left side and also the right side and right now it should look beautiful so this is our page up to now we have a background image of flut and then we have this information circular water inside which I will show the purple picture display name username number of subscriptions and videos and also we have a button which enable users to subscribe this particular Channel and then at the bottom of the page I also want to have something like some wigets to show the videos of this particular user so what I really mean is just uh let me just come at the bottom of the page outside of this padding I want to make a condition to say if there is videos inside this page I will show the videos and if there is not I will just share something like no video inside this channel so let me just create this and later on I can add this functionality using this you know whether we have videos or not because when we want to create the actual when I when I display the actual data which videos is also part of them I can just create this condition that if the user. videos is not equal to zero I can show the videos and if it is equal to zero I can just show a text to say no video but for now I can do it just using a Boolean so I'm going to just create a Boolean to say is you know have have videos and it will be equal to false initially and later on when I have the actual data I will just remove this Boolean and use the actual data of videos but for now just to add this functionality I'm doing it manually and at the bottom of the page after this pading I will say if have videos is equal to true in that case is I want to show the actual videos so for now it's going to be just a size box because I don't have the actual videos when I have it I will show the actual videos and if you don't have the actual videos I just want to show a text to say no video this is what I want to have and for now as you can see we have this no videos I just need to change the style to wrap it with a widget first of all I will wrap it with the center to bring it at the center of the page and I will also change the styling of this text let me just give it a fin size of like 23 and also already make it bold okay that looks great let me just increase this uh Fint size something like 26 or maybe 24 and will also want it to be right here not there so I can maybe add a spacer or also I can add padding actually I could just use padding I believe so let me just wrap this with a padding widget and I will give it a padding only from the top side and I will use just a media quy which makes our code match responsive and it will be just the same in all the screens and I will use hide here and I will just say that ad is pading from like 0.0% of this page and actually maybe it's really a lot so let me just use 0.2 and it's perfect so now we have all the UI completed we have a background image and then we have shown this data the profile picture and everything and then we are able to subscribe the user and then we wanted to be able to show all the users video here but if the channel doesn't have any video I will just show text to say no video and for now it's just all hardcoded and once I have the actual data I will create uh and display all the data inside this page so right now that we are done with the authentication and also the channel feature and I can just show and display every single data of the users and also my Channel I want to work on the next feature which is going to be the upload feature I wanted to enable user to upload any video to the channel on F screen and doing that first of all I need to create a bottom navigation bar inside the homepage so right now this is the homepage and I want to have a bottom navigation bar right here at the bottom so let me just open this homepage and at the end of this page I can just have this bottom navigation bar property and the bottom navigation that I want to create in this project is going to be the Google nav bar and we have a package for that let me just show I have already installed this package and this is the package Google Navar just make sure to install the latest version of this package and using this package I can create a very beautiful bottom navigation and uh I already have created it and it is available inside the starting project and if you have downloaded the starting project you will have all this uh stuff let me just show you inside the content feature I have bottom navigation a and as you can see I have used this Google or I can say GV it is a class from the Google Nav barar and using this class we have this beautiful bottom navigation bar and all of them Ripple color hover color these are all properties related to the UI of this gav and it will make the Google uh navigation bar much more beautiful and the only required parameter inside this gav is a tabs property inside which I can just create all the buttons I want to have inside this navigation bar and I have this five buttons uh a home viom Cloud upload search and heartbroken and this is what I got up to now the other properties are just related to the UI for example this curve just shows the animation that uh we have when we switch between the different tabs which right now it is is into line year and we have a duration for example we want to have a duration of for 19 milliseconds whenever we switch between different tabs so these are all properties related to this uiio for example we have a color of gray active color icon size and tab background color and everything here you can just uh go through this and it's really easy and I have just used this package called Google navbar from Dart package and this is a demo of this package and you can see it's really beautiful okay so let me just use this bottom navigation class inside homepage and I have to just import it and right now let me do a hard Resort and this is the bottom navigation I can simply switch between different tabs the first one is the home video cam in here I will show the shorts here upload search and also the last one is going to be log out I also need to uh do something for this because right now we are getting some overflow and I will uh fix it that's not a big deal okay so right now let me have this functionality to show different pages inside each tab here and doing that let me just open this bottom navigation page uh we have have a property called ontap change and selected index and everything first of all let me have this ontap change so what is this ontap change whenever we change between different tabs it means that we we are whenever we switch between different tabs this uh method will be triggered and this index is just the index of the current tab that we are in right now for example when I'm inside this Home tab this index will be equal to zero when I'm on this short stamp it will be equal to one and so on and so forth and I can just use this to just create this functionality to uh move on between different tabs and I will not do anything right here and I can just pass a parameter for uh botom navigation and initialize this value inside the homepage and I also need to uh let me just create this uh method really fast and it's going to be just a function and it has an INT which is going to be the index as parameter and I'm going to just call it unpressed let me just generate Constructor for it and I will just initialize the value here to say widget do unpressed or I should just say unpressed okay and right now we are getting this error inside the homepage and we need to initialize this onpress which has this index as parameter and I need to do something inside this onpress and I also want to create uh something let me just first of all change this St this vget into a stateful vget and then I can have a current index it is a type integer I don't need to make it final we have a current index which is going to be equal to zero initially and then I can just put it inside this selected index and inside the homepage once again we have this current index let me also create it here and I will just change this stead vet into a stateful pdet and then I can just create this current index which again is equal to zero initially so what basically I'm doing is to just create the functionality of switching between different tabs and showing different pages based on different tabs that we are in right now and I'm just doing this because I have separated this bottom navigation file from the homepage but if I just put everything inside the homepage it will be much easier but I don't want to do it and just to make our code much more recognizable I want to go WR this and I have just separated this bottom navigation from the homepage and what basically we are doing is that whenever this uh ontap change method is triggered and it's triggered whenever we switch between different tabs I just want to just trigger this onpress which I have initialized it inside the homepage and what I want to do is to say whenever this unpress is triggered first of all I want to make an F statement because I will say if index is not equal to two in this case what I just want to do is to put this index inside the current index and again finally do a setad and why I make this estad F adment to say if index is not equal to two you will understand it later on so I will explain it to you why I'm doing this for now just understand that if index is not equal to do we'll put the index which is going to be once again I'm saying the index of the current tab that we are in inside the current index and let me also create some pages here we will have a list or I can just create it let me just see if we have it already no we haven't I just need to create a list inside the Library which is going to be the pages list uh let me just remove this typo okay so here I can just have a list which is going to be the pages of all the pages that we have throughout this project inside the bottom navigation and for now I'm going to just put some you know widgets but later on I can just change it and replace it with some real Pages for now it's going to be some something like home I can just copy and paste it some more times the next one is shorts the next one is uh upload as you can see this upload is at the index number two 0 one and number two because whenever we upload uh maybe you have a good uh maybe you have uh understanding of why I made this statement because uh whenever the index is equal to two we want to uh just upload video we don't want to show any page and the next one also will be the home later on I will change it inside the home page and uh let me just tell you inside the body I have to show uh different pages based on what we have so at the end of this column right here I can just make an expanded widget and the child is just going to be the pages first of all let me just import it and the index is going to be the current index okay and right now I will show you what I have created so far let me just do a hot restart so as you can see the first page is the homepage right now it is a center which wiget of text and right now we only have a center widget and inside which I have a text to say home when I navigate to this one it says shorts and uplers home and everything so I just I have just created this uh to say let me just explain to you once again what I have done so far first of all I have created this gnv from the Google Navar package and it's a package to create this beautiful bottom navigation bar for us and here we have five tabs for each of these tabs that we have for the home shorts upload search and L log out and we have an ontap change property which just it has it is a method which triggers every time we switch between different tabs and I have initialized it inside the homepage to say if index is not equal to two I want to put the index inside the current index which this current index is the current index of the page that we are right now so it's really simple and we have all this Pages here which later on I will replace them with real pages and we have this but whenever we click on this button see I have this if statement to say that if index is not equal to two this should happen this is index number zero index number one index number two so three and four this index number four is going to have uh in the index number two I want to upload a video so I don't want to show any page but what I want to show is just a model bottom shet so I believe I already have it inside starting project I have yeah I have this create bottom sheet and as you can see uh inside this bottom sheet I have some vets let me just show you in the imediator first of all let me just create it so I need to have an else statement if the index index is equal to two I just want to show a model bottom sheet and inside the Builder I will return this create bottom sheet which I already have created okay right now when I go to index number two which is for the upload this model bottom sheet appears and pop up and right now we have only a title to say create and then we have all these options to create a short upload a video go live and create the post so what I work right now is this upload a video and let me right now let me just open this Morel bottom sheet and this is the item for the upload a video and you can just go through this page uh I haven't explained it yet uh it's a really simple page it's a create bottom shade and it's simply a container and we have a column a text to say create and then I have all this image items which all of them are just inside the starting project you can just go through every single one of them and it's not really hard so this is the item to upload a video and whenever the user clicks on this item I want them to upload a video and then put it inside the storage and then into the fire store I already have this method file and here I will create a method to pick image so whenever this upload video button is clicked I want the user to pick a video I will uh create a method to pick a video and then they can upload it into the fire store and uh also the Firebase storage so first of all let me just create it real quick then the method name is going to be P video and of course it's going to be a synchronous and I can just use the image picker class to say Peck a video and the source for now is going to be just the gallery I'm going to just say image source. gallery okay of course it's going to be a weit and I can just put it inside an x file called file so I hope hope that you are already familiar how we can work with this image picker class I just uh use this method called pick video to pick a video from the gallery image seces gallery and then I have this file which is going to be the type x file if you are not familiar with this uh package I have already video and you can just check it out uh I'm not going to go in details but I have right now this file the type x file but I want to change it into a file type so I need to import this and then I will call it a video and to say like this and if you can inter send it just make sure to go through the video on image speaker package and finally if the video is not equal to null and that's why that I will return this video okay so now we have this pick video and whenever this upload the video button is clicked I want to show I want to just trigger this Pig video okay and let me just check it in the emulator that whenever I click this upload a video we will be able to upload any video from the gallery okay it's working so the next uh when we get the video we wanted to put it inside Firebase storage uh let me just open my uh Firebase project and first of all just make sure to enable this Firebase storage and you can just go through this build and then you can just enable this storage I have already done it but you should also make sure to do it because we need to store all the videos and images inside this Firebase storage now inside the methods file I can just create a new method called quid file in this storage so let me just create this method real fast and of course this method is going to be asynchron and what I want to do in this method is to just uh upload the file which in this is going to be a video inside the Firebase storage so first of all let me just uh import and I and I have already done it you just need to import the Firebase storage and then I can create an inance of Firebase storage and then using this inance of Firebase storage I can just use the Riff method and then inside the child I can specify where this file should be located inside the fireb storage which in this case I'm going to just use a parameter uh I need actually three parameters here the first parameter is going to be the file so it's the file that I'm going to upload inside the storage the number uh the second one is going to be the number and it's just simply that a number that help me to differ between different files and different videos and also the third one which is going to be the file type I just need to specify whether this file is a video or image or something because I need to use this method for uploading the video and also uploading the profile picture and I can just use it for both cases so let me just uh specify the file type and here the first thing that I'm going to just say is I want to uh just upload the file type so first of all I just need to specify the file type so we understand that this file a type of video or image or something the next I just use uh something like a number and as I said this number is just used to specify and differ between different files I mean between different images and different videos and it help us to do that so the result of this method is going to be something like a riff so let me just store it inside this riff variable and then I can just use this Riff to put the file I can put a file I can put a string data or blob but in this case I'm going to just put a file and the file is going to be this file which is this one and I will just store this result of this inside a variable called upload and then I just need to let it up be uploaded so let me just await this upload and what I'm doing is just uh giving it some time for this file to be uploaded inside this storage and then I will put the result inside a variable called snapshot okay and now finally using this snapshot I can just download the URL so let me just use this RI and finally get download URL so basically we are just downloading it and the result is going to be the type of string so let me just write string and it is uh download URL and of course it's going to be a wait because it will take some time and if we don't know when the uh snapshot will be downloaded and finally I just want to return this uh download URL let me just uh correct this typo okay so let me just explain once again that what we are doing inside this method first of all I just create an instance of fireb storage and then I use this RI and finally the child to just specify where I want this file to be located inside the storage and I just said it should be first of all I need to specify the file type and then a number to Just differ between different images and videos and then using this RI which we got the result from the first method I just uh used it to put the file inside the storage and then we await this upload because we will give it some time to be uploaded and finally I just downloaded a uh URL and of course it's a type of string and it this download URL is basically the URL of the video or the image that we uploaded and I can just use this method across my project and use it to put any file inside the storage so I can use it many times now that you are done here let me just go back to uploading the video and the first thing I need to do is to just create a page so as you can see inside the upload bottom sheet whenever the user clicks on this button upload a video we let them to upload a video and pick a video from their Galler and once the video is picked I want them to go to a new page called uh video details and inside that page they can just uh give their video a title a description and then they can choose uh a thumbnail finally they can publish their video inside the database so first of all let me just create this page and later on they can work on the logic okay so inside the upload feature I can create a new file a new uh folder which I'm going to call long video okay so this is going to be the long video and first of all I will create a page called video Details page input the material. dart and create an status fidget which I'm going to just call it video details PCH here just like always I need to uh return an scaffold later I have a body a safe area the child is going to be a padding and it has a padding from the top side padding of 20 the child of this padding is just going to be a column and I need to create everything right here so first of all uh let me just explain to you that what's uh uh going to be this page and how it will look like I just want to create a page inside which I can uh you know enter and insert all the details of my video uh first of all I need to create uh a text fi for entering the title then I need to create a text fill for entering the description so I need basically two text fills and then I want to create a button called select thumbnail and when user clicks on it they can select their thumbnail and finally they can publish their video so let me just work on it inside the column uh inside the children property first of all I will create a text field so Tex fil has a decoration just type input decoration let me give it a text to say enter the title and then I also want to give it a suffix icon or maybe a perfect second uh okay first of all let me just run the emulator that we can see how this page is going to look like and we can see it real time okay now the project is run and uh let me just go inside the men D and change the homepage to this this page that I'm just creating it which is going to be the video Details page I'm just doing it for now and later on I can just fix all of them and this is the page and this is the text field that I just created let me just minimize this vs that you can see the emulator properly and I can just do it like this now inside this video Details page uh the first thing that I just created was a text fi and I can also give it a a padding from the left and the right side and I will with a padding of 10 from the left from the left and also from the right side and it will look much better right now and I can just modify this text fi like uh giving it the border which is going to be the type outline input border and here the Border Side and now I want to just give it a color of something like blue now I have this text field to enable me enter the title and I just want to create the same text field also for the description but before that let me also give it a perect icon so exactly here I can give it a perect icon which is going to be the type icon and the name will be title so this is the icon that I want to have as a perix and it looks like this and before this text field I also want to have a text to say enter the title let me just create this as well that I can just tell the user that okay you need to create uh you need to enter your title here and it looks like this I just need to maybe change the cross AIS alignment to start and now it looks great let me also change the text style of this text to give it a f size of like 15 a color of gray okay and now it should lock nice and I can also give it a size box uh to give it a distance from this text field and it will be a size box with a height of four okay I give it a size box with a height of five and now it looks much better let me just uh do it real quick for also the description I need to Cate a text like this to say in enter the description and I need to create the same text field again this time for the description so let me just copy it and paste it right there I just need to change this SX as say enter the description and I also need to change the perfect icon and I need to actually I don't need to have a perfect icon so let me just remove this perfect icon okay so now it looks great and I also need to give a size box between these two so I will create a size box with a height of something like 20 or I also should change this to like 40 or I believe 30 is enough and I again need to have uh you know a size box between these two to give it a size box with a height of five okay that's great now I I have a text fi for a title and also text fi for a description the next I want to create a button and this button is just to select the thumbnail so let me just specify it here that I need to I just make a comment to say I need to create a button to select thumbnail from here and it's going to be just a container so now I just need to remove this cons from here and put it in this places to remove this blue warnings okay so I have a container and let me just change the decoration of this container actually I just want to create a container which has uh first of all let me change let me give it a color so I will give it a color of blue and I also want to change the Border radius so I will give it a b radius of something like 11 bar radius. all and then I give it a bar radius of type circular which is 11 and then the child of this uh container is going to be just a text button and it it has an unpressed which for now is going to be just empty and the text is just going to say select thumbnail okay and I also want to change the text style of this select thumbnail and I will give it a color of white okay everything is perfect I just need to go above the page and here this cross uh cross aess alignment should be stretch and now as you can see this button looks like this which is perfect and let me also wrap this container with a padding and I will give it a padding from the top side and a padding of 12 okay that looks I believe so great and I also want to change something from this inter the description text field because I want to give it uh I want this text field to be much bigger than this so I need to change the max lines of this text fill to be something like five actually not the title the description so now this title uh this description text field is much bigger because description has more stuff to write inside okay everything is good and now let me just change this this widget into wiget because I need to create some controllers for this text field and I also want it to be like this okay whenever the user uh clicks on this select thumbnail they should be able to pick an image and that image is going to be the thumbnail of this video and then when the image is uploaded I want to display the image right here and also whenever the image is selected so the image here is going to be the thumbnail and when the thumbnail is selected I want to display a button here to say publish the video so first of all let me just create this uh controllers for the text field and the first one is going to be just a title controller which is of course the type text editing controller let me just copy and paste it one more time and the second one is going to be for description controller and I will just put it inside uh a property called controller the first one is for the title controller and of course I just need to remove this const and the second one is going to be for the description controller and once again I just need to remove this const from here okay now I also want to create a variable for saying if the thumbnail is selected or not so let me just create a Boolean which I'm going to just call it s thumbnail selected so if the Tom is selected or not based on it I want to show different stuff inside this page and I'm going to just create a new button here for publishing the video so let me just copy everything from this uh Button as well I will just take this and copy it one more time I'm going to just change this to say publish and I also I also want to change the color to Green now I have this uh second button to publish the video and and I don't want this button to be displayed whenever the thumbnail is not selected I mean when the thumbnail is selected in which case I want to show this display uh this publish button so let me just uh give it a you know a condition to say if is thumbnail selected variable is equal to true in this case only I want to show this publish button but if it's not true I just want to show a size box it means nothing and right now you can see because this thumbnail selected variable is equal to files right now uh we are not seeing anything so right now I need to uh select the thumbnail whenever the user clicks on this but select thumbnail I want to uh select a thumbnail so I need to have a peak image uh method let me just open this method folder uh file and I need to create a new method here to say Peak image and here of course this image is going to be just our thumbnail and you know what I can just copy everything from here let me just copy it and paste it right there I just need to change this peak video into Peak image they're completely the same once again I'm saying that if you don't know how to work with this image picker class so as you can see I have UT this this image picker it is a DT package and if you don't know how to work with it I have a video already and you can learn everything about this package but for now yeah we are doing this and we are picking image and finally I should call it image not video okay now let me back get back here and whenever the user clicks on this button I want this peak image method to be triggered okay and it will just let them to pick image from gallery and as you can see the return uh uh the return of this method is just an image so I can just get that and I can just put it inside a variable called like image and let me just create this variable as well of course it's going to be the type string so let me just create a final no no it's not final a string called image and it will be initially equal to uh it will not have an initial value so I have a string image and when the user Peak an image uh later on i1 the result of that Peak image go inside and be stored inside this image variable and when we pick an image it means that we selected a thumbnail I want this thumbnail selected variable to be equal to true because we selected the thumbnail again I'm going to do a set it and now I just want to display this image right here so I will display it right here to say if it's thumbnail selected is equal to true I want to show this uh file type which is going to be image let's see what is the error here okay I just need to change because that's not a type of string actually it's a type of file now the error should be gone yeah that's right and I also say if it's not true I want to just display a size box so what you saying here that if this thumbnail selected is equal to true I want to show this image and it has a cached height which in this case going to be 160 and also it has a cached WID which is going to be 400 okay everything is done and now let me just do a hot rest and we will check how it's looking and I will also explain to you once again that what we did throughout this file so now I can inter title and then I can enter a description and then I can select the thumbnail and right now I don't have any image so let me just put some image inside this emulator I will go inside my pictures and I can just put this image right here yeah now I can just select this image and once I selected it should be uploaded right here so let me see if there's any problem when I click on this Peck image button this meod should be triggered and then the result of this uh method which is going to be an image it should be stored inside this image and once it's done I want a select the thumbnail to be equal to true and then do a set set so what's wrong here let me just terminate the project and run it once again now when I click on this button I can s an IM image and again it's not working so let me just check what's the problem here when we pick an image this s th s it should be equal to true and then I do a set set it's just saying that future Dynamic is not a subtype of file maybe I just need to specify the return type of this peak image which is going to be a future of file this is the type of this big image and of course it just need to be like this and let me just remove this if admin I don't need it anymore really let me just make it like this and then I have to await this method and make this method a signal I hope the error is gone now now if I select the thumbnail again it's not working maybe I need to have back this seted and now when i s a thumbnail yeah it's working perfectly okay that's great now we have this thumbnail let me just give it a size box uh I want this image to have some distance from the top side so let me just find this image and then I want it to have a padding we will have a padding from the top side okay and I can also do it the same uh here I wanted to have a padding from the top uh from the down side as well from the bottom side I will give it a padding from the bottom 12 as well so now it's working it's great and now what I basically want to do is to whenever I select on this uh button when I select the thumbnail and now I can publish the video whenever I click on this button to publish the video my video model and my video should be uh published and the data should be stored inside the database so first of all I need to create this video model so let me just go and create it inside the long video I can have a new file called video model and let's see which features uh I mean which fills do we need inside this model so let me just create a class called video model and here we're going to have some Fails Like video URL thumbnail title that published views video user ID type and likes so let me just create them one by one the first one is going to be the video URL the next one is going to be thumbnail the next one title the next one is going to be date published I also want to know on which date the video was published the next one is going to be views the next one is video ID so each video should have a unique video ID that we can later on refer to that video and I also want to have a user ID because I want to know which user and which channel has published this specific video and the next one is going to be a list of likes so I just want to know that how many people and which people has liked this video and also the final one is going to be type and once again if you don't know why I'm just creating this type I want to just uh specify that this model is a video or it's a user and in the next feature which is going to be the search feature you will understand that why I'm creating this type now let me just generate Constructor for it and I also want to generate Json calization and I will remove this two because we don't need it anymore and also this convert uh we getting some error here now the errors are gone and everything is okay so now I have this video model and what basically I want to do is to just when the thumbnail is selected and I have the image inside here I want to publish the video and the first thing that I want to do is to put the file inside the storage so what basically I'm doing is just to say uh use the put file in the storage the file is going to be the image the number is going to be just some random number so I will use the U the uid package let me just import it and using this package I can just create a random number okay it's going to be the type string I will call it random number and I will use the V4 method so it just generate a ROM number for us and I can just use it to differ between different files I will use this random number and the file typ here is going to be video so first of all I put the file inside the storage and of course the result is going to be my thumbnail and I can just put it inside a variable called thumbnail so now that I have the thumbnail I actually want to upload the video inside the fireb fire ser and for being it I need to create a repository to upload a video and I'm going to just call it video repository here I need to create a class called video repository and here once again I need to have a Firebase a and also a Firebase Fire Resource so let me just create them really fast the first one is a Firebase fire and the next one is going to be Firebase us and I'm going to just call it Al and let me just let me just generate Constructor for it and now the first method uh is going to be just uploading the video into the fire store so I will create a method called upload video to fire store this me is going to be any synchronous and then here I just want to upload it so I will use this firer and then I will create a new collection called videos and the document of this uh video is going to be just the video ID and then I can set the data and the data is going to be here a video model so let me just create this video model first of all import it video model and it's going to be equal to video model so this is our video model and let's initialize the value here first of all we have a video URL so all this uh things should be you know initialize using this parameters so let me just let me just give it some parameters required string video URL the next one is required string the thumbnail because we need to have all this values uh from the video Details page the next one is a thumbnail the next one is going to be the title and description actually I don't need description but I need the thumbnail the next one is dat published views is going to be just empty and then video video ID it's going to be again to type string this video ID and again it's going to be de published actually it's a type dead time and I need the user ID as well and here I get this error because I made a mistake while creating the video model let me just uh correct it because this de publish is not a type string actually it's a type de time and I just need to fix that and here it's not as a string it's as date time now the errors should be gone and this views is going to be just an empty list actually it's going to be zero so this views is Ty okay again I made this mistake views is not a type uh string but it's a type integer and I just need to also correct it right here so this view is going to be equal to zero and the likes is going to be a LM list and the type is going to be video so now everything is okay and here I will just set this to video. two map because I want to put the data inside apply the data inside the Firebase fire sir and let me just do an await here and now everything should be okay let me also just remove this unnecessary stuff so now I have this and let me just create a controller and a provider for this so I will just say final video controller I should say or video provider I mean so I would say long video provider just like what we did in the previous examples as well and it's going to have a simple provider which returns this video repository and the Firebase is going to be just Firebase fire not sense and I believe I don't need this Firebase Al so I will just remove this and I will also remove this from here now everything should be good and I can just use this long video provider and here for first of all let me just change this St full widget into a consumer St full widget and I will put this consumer in here and also here so you're already familiar with this things and you know how can I do it and here I can just use this RI to call the watch method and then I will use the long video provider to access it as with upload video for fire sir now I have to initialize all this parameters dat published and everything the data publish is going to be just dat time.now simple the next one is going to be user ID which is going to be Firebase alsin sense. Curren user. ID so the user ID is going to be just the uh U ID of the current user because only the current user is uploading the video right it's absolutely clear let me just put a comma here and then I have the video URL thumbnail is okay the title is going to be just the title controller. text and then this video ID I can just create a random ID so let me just create this one as well I will say string I will just call it the video ID and it's going to be again V4 so this is going to be my video ID and finally this video URL is just okay uh so this was a thumbnail I believe there is a mistake here the video yeah I will get the video from the previous page so I just need to create it as a parameter here let me just create it right here to say final I believe it's Ty file so I'm going to just sa video I just need to get this video from the previous page and now let me also correct this because this is not a video it is an image because this is our thumbnail and the video URL is going to be just widget. video and I will have access to it from the previous page so now everything should be okay and I just need to upload a video and inside this pick video whenever I pick the video in this case I want to get back to that whenever I get the video I don't want to just return it but actually I want to do a navigation so I want to just do like this and then say material page out and I just want to make a na navigation to video Details page and the video is going to be just the video of course I can just remove this uh return because I don't want to return anything I will just change this string to a file and I will also need to give it a context and now everything should be okay I will initialize this context right here and I also want to say that what we are returning from this big video which is uh just a future of file as we saw from the previous one and actually we are not returning anything it's just a future here I want to say that it is a wait and again it's this is a s so I believe everything should be okay right now let's see if there's any error here because it says that the argument type file can be assigned to a string because I need to take its path not the actual video okay so everything is okay let me just do hard restart and if there is no error actually we have some error here let me just remove this required we don't need it to be required and I just need to put a exclamation mark here so now everything should be okay let me just do a hot restart and everything should be working so I forgot just one step right here and that is that I also need to put the video inside the storage and then I need to get the URL back and put it inside the database so let me just do this step real quick and I will just create uh this video URL variable and then I can just use this put file into the storage and the file here just needs to be the video I mean the widget. video that we get it as parameter from the previous page and then we have this number which is again going to be just uh that random number that we just created and the file type is going to be just a video instead of a thumbnail or image so now I have this video URL and when I use this provider and inside this method I will just use this video URL as uh my video that is going to be uploaded Inside the Fire database so now everything should be okay and when I upload the video uh it should just be upload it and we will check it so let me just run the project okay then this is our project and let me just uh make uh everything just right because we don't want to just see this B inside the men Dart uh let me just do like this and then I will close all the pages and then inside the men Dart uh I just don't want to show this video details the screen but instead I want to show the homepage and this is going to be my homepage and now I need to just create all that Pages like Channel page and the next upload page whenever I click on here and when I click here I can upload just a video and when I upload this video let me just check if it works or not so when I click on it it should just go and upload the file inside the database first of all we are navigated to this page so here I can just type a title for this uh video which is going to be first video on the platform and then the description which is going to be something like hello it's not really important as you saw I have not added a description inside my video model but it can be just a homework to you and you can just add the description inside your model uh and you can just show it on but I have not done it so I don't need it and the next I can just select a thumbnail so I'm going to select this one and now I'm able to publish the video so let's see if it's working or do we get any error the type feature Dynamic is not a type of string so that's going to be our error and that's right here if I put on a weit and do a sing here maybe it can just solve our problem let me also do it for the next method because as you know this put file in the storage is going to be a type of future let me also make it clear that it is a type of future string I mean what we return from this method is a future of a string it just need to be more clear and I await this method let me do a hard rest start and I'm going to just uh try one one more time let's come here I will click upload a video and I will upload this video near I'm going to just run it once again first video on the platform description is going to be just hello I will select a thumbnail for it like this video and then I can just publish the video let's see if it works this time or not okay it looks like everything is just right so we have this new collection of videos and as you can see this is going to be the video ID and this is the title which it says first video on the platform the type is video this is the user ID it means uh the user ID of the channel who uploaded this video into this platform and then we have this video ID and as you can see this video ID and this one right here is exactly the same because we want it to be the same and the guy who uploaded this video has this user ID B4 AP and if I just open this users collection you can see that it should be exactly right here here and the guy B for EP this is the exact guy which is of course div this is the account that I just upload the video with so everything is correct and it's working perfectly well and now that I I can upload the video into the firest fire store I want to be able to retrieve this video and display it into the UI so I can just do it using something like stream Builder and let's start working on it so now I have to work on just you know retrieving the data and the video back from the firester database and I can just do it inside this content feature it's also one of the other features that I have and I want to show my videos short videos and comments inside this content feature and as you can see I have already this long video in which I have this part video and this is going to be the video and it's just a starting project and we have some stuff here and and I also have this uh bar of navigation which already we saw it and also I have this widgets which is going to be video external button it's just a simple widget it has a container and a row and I have also video first comment which for now I don't have to be concerned of the comment I just need to work on the video so let's start working on it and the first thing that I want to just create is a post because this post is going to be just something uh this post is going to be the first thing that the user sees when he open the feed screen I mean uh the thumbnail and the title and everything will be inside this post so actually this post uh widget is going to be just the thumbnail and the title and this stuff that you want to show it to the user I'm going to just show a thumbnail a title and the profile picture display name of the channel who uploaded that video and also I want to to show that how many views that video has and also uh the date published of the video so I'm going to just show this stuff inside this page and let's start creating it first of all I will just import the material. dart create an set this widget and I don't need to create an scaffold first of all let me just give it a name something like post and that's enough and here as I said I don't need to create an scaffold but I do need to create something like a container and then the child will be a column so first of all let me just tell you how it's going to be created um the first thing is going to be uh the thumbnail so the thumbnail that we already uploaded and here it's going to be just a cached Network image and then after that I can show the profile picture and title and later on the display and uh number of views and also the did publish so it's going to be really easy and quick first of all let me just inut the cached Network image I will use this package to show this uh thumbnail and for doing it let me just create cached Network image widget and the image URL for now I'm going to just use uh some random ede from the internet let me just type here image and I can just use any image for now it's going to be just hardcoded for now but later on I can just add the actual thumbnail when we get the data but for now it's going to be just hardcoded that you can just see it for now copy image address yeah I can just copy this address and paste it exactly right here okay this is going to be the cached Network image let me just put a comma here so after showing the image then I can show the perfect picture and title but before that as I said uh let me just work and just uh put all the pages inside the which they should be so let me just do some stuff here I'm going to show all the pages for example when I click on this button and when I click on this button on the profile picture I should see the account pit which I already have it like let me just show it to you exactly here I have an account feature and right here I have all the items which is exactly the same like the YouTube uh so let me just show this page and for now there is no page exactly but I have this items and so first of all let me just create you know this uh account pitch because it's really necessary so I'm going to just create a pitch called account pitch and I will import the material. dart create an stus fidget and I will just call it account page and return and scaffold and inside this account page I just need to show all the users data actual the current users actual data and for doing it uh inside the body I can have a column and inside the children's I can show everything right here and for now I'm going to just show the items so now let me just open this homepage and what I want to do is when I the user clicks on this profile picture they should be navigated to the account page so let me just find this uh Circle aatar and I will just wrap it with a gesture detector and inside the onp property I can say whenever the user clicks on it I want them to be navigated to that page so let me just create a navigator real quick okay now as you can see when I C click on this I'm navigated to this page and let me just do some customization inside this page and I'm going to just come here first of all I will up this column with a safe area and also give it a padding just like always and let me now just wrap it with a padding and I will give it a padding of 20 from the top side just like always and now I also want to show the users the current users information like the profile picture the display name and everything so let me just do that as well inside the column first of all I need to create a circle aor it's going to have big radius like 40 I'll say a background image of gray and then below that I can just uh create a text which I will show just the display name I need to change the texy to give it a f size of something like 24 and also the F way of bold and that's enough then I also want to show the username so let me just create that one as well something like Ahmed amini at sign Ahmed amini I I also want to change the style and we will have a f size of like 1.5 and also a color of blue gray okay so this is going to be my username I can just change this page later on as like if I want to change it I can just customize this display name username and everything and I can just make it the way I want it looks like but for now I'm going to just be okay with this and just let me uh have a padding with this text so I will wrap this text with a padding and I would give it a padding from the uh from the bottom side and it going to be a padding of 12 so I hope it looks uh much better and I also can have a padding you know uh right here so I will WRA this text as well with a padding and I will have a padding this time from the top side again a padding of 12 so everything is okay now let me just uh have a parameter here so the parameter is going to be a user model because we want to show the uh exact user the current users's data inside this page I will call it user and generate Constructor so now I have to initialize the value here which is going to be this current user so first of all let me remove this cons and then the user is going to be just the current user and now I should be able to have the actual data let me just run the project once again or it's actually running right now so I have created this user and I have the value but I need to initialize it inside this widgets like Circle text because right now as you can see we have only the hard the hard coded value so here inside the background image I will once again use the cached Network image provider and the URL is going to be just uh this user. profile picture the next is going to be just a display name and it will have this user do display name the next one is and the final one is going to be the username so we will have the username here and let me also just put some cons here because we will be able to get rid of this blue warnings which slow down the tempter okay so now we can see that we have the actual value the perect picture display name and the username so everything is working perfectly fine and I also want to have a button here that let me just uh uh you know navigate back and have a navigation. pop to the previous page that I came from here to this page so let me just create that one as well and for doing it you know I just need to take everything from the circle Avatar to this uh text at the end and first of all I need to create a row and I will paste it again here and again I will take all of this and create a new column and paste it again right here but before that inside the row I want to have an icon button the unpress is going to be just something like uh navigation. pop uh I mean Navigator pop which it will just let us to get back to the previous pitch and then the icon is going to be just something like icons. Arrow back and now I have this um actually the UI is not really looking very nice now I just need to bring it once again to the center so let me just have a look at it okay so I really don't know what's wrong here so I will just uh you know fix this uh UI prob later on so we don't need to focus on this one right now I will just change this uh Arrow or I would just change it everything is good I will change I will just fix this UI uh problem later on for now I don't have to focus on this and when I click on this I will be navigated back to this hom page so this is also working well and inside the hom page exactly this page all you want to show the data that we get from the fire back which is going to give you the videos so now we can work on that one let me just open this post so we are trying to creat this post which is uh as I said before is going to be our thumbnail title and exactly the first thing that the users will see when they are on the F uh F screen okay and let me just uh put this post inside this screen that I want to be seeing it which is going to be just uh the video screen so here I need to create a new file to just call it long video screen and I will just UT the material. dart and then create an scaffold to just call it video I mean long video screen create the scaffold and inside the body I will just have a column okay so now I need to put this long video screen inside actually the body of the homepage or I should just say let me open this Pages uh file in the first page I want to have the this long video screen page and instead of just having a text like this to say home I want to have the actual page of long video screen and this is going to be the first page and for now it's just empty so let's work on it and inside the long video screen I can just have you know an stream Builder which inside I show the post so let me just remove this column and instead I can have and stream Builder because I want to show the actual data using this stream Builder and the stream is going to be just Firebase so I will just create an instance of Firebase firer then I will go inside the collection of videos then I'm not going to just specify a doc because I want to just get all all the documents so I'm going to just say snapshots I want to just go to let me just explain it to you I want to just go through the collection of videos and then get a snapshot of all documents inside this collection okay then we have a builder and what I want to do here is actually to return you know a list view. Builder and that's it inside this uh you know list be do Builder I want to just return a post and this list. Builder also has an item count but for now it's going to be just something like one I just want to show one post because I don't have the actual value and it's going to be just uh right for now because right now we don't have an actual value but later on when we added the value it would be much great so let me just run the project okay so that's what we are seeing right now and I will just minimize the vs code that we can see it and this uh picture is this post and this cach network image that we just created inside the post as I said to you the first thing that the users will see inside this video screen will be the thumbnail the title and just this page so this post is exactly the first thing that the users will see when uh they want to click on a video and they when they click on this post they will be navigated to the video which we will created that one as well but first let's work on this post so the next thing after showing this image is going to be just the profile picture and that stuff and for doing it first of all I need to create a row I believe and then inside the row I want to show a circle aor I mean I need to show the purple picture inside a circle AAR so let me just create this it has a radius of something like 20 and then it has a background color of gray and after that I want to show the profile pck I mean I want to show the display name or actually I don't want to show the display name but I want to show the title of the video which in this case going to be just any title it's just hardcoded for now I can just save once again first video here so this is going to be the the title of the video and I also want to show just an icon button here I want to have an icon at the end of this page and the icon is going to be just something like uh yeah this is the name of the icon more word and it's just three do uh upon each other in the actual YouTube we have this icon in the thumbnail so I also want to have this now let me just do something like uh I want to change the main axis alignment of this row and we will have a main AIS alignment of space between and this way or actually not a space between but I can put it a start and then have a spacer between uh for this icon so I will just do it like this okay I just Chang the main access alignment to start because we want to have everything at the beginning but later on add a spor to just put away this icon at the end of this row okay now let me just do some customization here for example adding a padding to this title so let me just wrap it with a padding and I will give just a padding from the left side a padding of something like 10 and now it looks beautiful and I also want to change the text uh style of this title because it needs to be something like uh first of all it has to be bold maybe that's okay for now and after this row at a continuous to the column I want to show the display name of the user who uploaded this video the the number of views and also dead published so let me just uh create maybe another row so the next inside this row I just need to create the display name and number of views and did published so let me just first of all create a display name which is going to be Ahmed amini and then I can also just create the number of views for now and for now it's going to be just say new because initially number of views is equal to zero and when the user clicks on the video uh it will just increment and then I can also create the de publish which uh now I'm going to just say like a moment ago okay that's all right and now you can see it's like this and let me just give it a padding it just needs some customize uh it just needs some customize to look beautiful and I will give it a padding like symmetric and then horizontally a padding of eight the next I also need to change uh you know the background I I also just need to change the color of this text so I will give it all a color of blue gray and now now it looks like this and let me just uh wrap this row with a padding as well to just uh you know give it a padding from the left side and I will just use the media query for this uh for doing this purpose and I will have I will use this media query do size of context and then W and I can just use something like 0.1 let's see yeah I think it looks great let me just do something like 0.2 and now that's much better so now I have this and let me also just you know give it some padding to this profile picture because it's not really looking very nice and for doing it I'm going to just wrap this circle I was already padding I can have a padding from the top side like four and also from the left side four five and now uh you know I will give it a padding of eight from the top side so now it looks perfect and we have this uh we have this uh Network image we have this thumbnail perfect picture uh title and this stuff and now I want to give it the actual value instead of just some hardcoded and for doing it I need to have you know I just need to get the value of this and I will just use a parameter so I will have a video model and I will call it a video and then I will generate Constructor for it but before it let me just uh have the actual value of video here and it's going to be just the video and now inside this stream Builder when I get the data so first of all uh let me just check some if you're already familiar how to work with stream Builders you know that uh we can check some conditions here that if we got the data if the data is loading and when we have the actual data we just want to show and display this list view. Builder that we return the actual data which is going to be a list of videos first of all I just want to check if the data is not equal if the data if the data is equal to null so I'm going to just say if the snapshot the data is equal to null in this case I want to just return you know an error page because we don't have any edor and else I want to just check if the data is loading so I will just say if a snapshot. connection set is equal to connection set. waiting it means that we don't have uh the data yet it mean the data is loading which in this case I want to just return the loader pitch and actually I don't want to check it like this snap the data is equal to n but um a safer way to do it is just to say snapshot. has data is not true so this is a more safer way to say if we don't have the data it doesn't matter if it is null or it is any other case but if it don't have the data I just want to show that this's error pitch and we don't care why we don't have the the data but in this case we only want to sh the error p and when we have the data it's not loading in this case only we want to return this list without Builder inside this stream Builder inside the function I want to just uh first of all get the actual data right here so I will just say snapshot the data and then docs so this docs is going to be just so what I what actually I'm doing is just to say snapshot the data which in this case the data is going to be a collection of videos so then I get the docs which is all documents it means all the videos I can just store it inside a variable called video Maps so I have this video maps and then I can do a map and I get each video right now and now that I have each video I want to use the video model do from map and the map is going to be just the video. data so now I have this and I'm going to just return this and finally converted into a list so I hope now I have this list of videos yeah now I have a list of video model so what I actually did was that first of all I used this I Snapchat the data and then I got all the docs it means all the videos which are going to be a list of cury document sshot and then I stored it inside this video maps and then I use this map to go through each of the videos and then use the FR map to convert that into a video model and then finally convert all of them into a list and store it inside this variable videos so now inside this l. Builder instead of uh having this one as a hardcoded uh number I can just use this videos do length and the video is going to be just videos index let me just remove this cons and everything should be good so now let me just do a hot restart and if you don't have any error it should be per it should be working perfectly fine actually we got some error here so let me just uh find we have something imported like dart. GS which I need to remove that yeah this is going to be that let me just remove that and do how to start once again it just says that type time stop is not a subtype of dat time in the typ cast so we got some error type we got some type errors and let me just find it where we have this error to resolve it so to resolve this error I just need to change this from map method inside the video model and just remove this uh stuff from the publish and replace what I'm writing here okay so this would be working and now when I open the emulator you can see that there is no error so let me just do a how Restort once again just make sure to replace this code instead of that and everything is good up to now and the error is gone let me just open the post one second so here I just need to replace this hardcoded codes with the actual dat which is going to be this video okay first of all I will just show the profile picture and instead of this I can just say video do uh thumbnail this is going to be the purle uh I mean this is going to be the thumbnail and it should be uploaded in a moment the next one is going to be the circle aor in which here I just need to show the uh profile picture of the user who uploaded this video so I in in the background image I can just use the cache Network image provider and here I'm going to just say video do uh actually so I'm going to just uh comment this for now I will just do it later on the next one is the title I'm going to just say video. title and remove this cons from here yeah it's great the next one is going to be the number of views and and this is first of all the again the display the display name of the user who is uploading this video and the next one is number of views so I can just say video do views and I have to change it to a string the next one is did publish which for now I'm going to just put it like this so uh What uh else I need to do is to you know find the the display name and the profile picture of the user who uploaded this video and I can just do it really easily because I have the user ID and using this user ID I can find the actual data of the you know Channel who uploaded this video and that is the reason that I just added this user ID as one of the parameters you know as one of the fields inside the video model because using it I want to find the the the the guy who just uploaded this video and it can help us using this user ID so now to initialize the value for the uh display name right here and also for the profile picture of the current user who just uploaded the video I need to create a consumer vidget and for this means I'm going to just change this instead this widget into a consumer widget and I have to just add and I just need to add this fidget drive right here inside the build meod which I'm going to just call the drift so right here I need to create a new provider so I'm going to just open uh user provider and as you can see right now we only have one provider which is going to be for current user provider I'm going to create one new provider which is called any user data provider and why I'm creating this actually there are some times that I don't need to just retrieve the current user but I want to just retrieve any user which is needed exactly like what I need inside this post which uh different users upload different videos and I want to just retrieve the current uh you know uh the display name of the user who uploaded the video and for this case I need to create this any user data provider and there's a difference between this provider and the current user data provider so let me just show it to you because uh first of all I'm going to create a future provider and in this case ref is not the only parameter in the previous providers that you saw we only had one provide uh we had only one parameter which was R and we just used it to connect different providers together but in this case when we are using any user data provider I need to add one more parameter which is going to be just the user ID and if you wonder why I need to add this user ID because as you can see uh when I want to retrieved for example the display name of the current user it asks me for a user ID and for this case I need to just initialize this user ID and pass it as a parameter uh in this provider and for this means I don't uh I cannot just use a simple feature provider but I need to use something like feature provider. family and using this family I can just add a new parameter so I just need to create this feature provider but that's not just a simple feature provider I need to add a family right here and right now I can add my second argument which is going to be the user ID now once again I can just use this uh fetch current user data or I should just create a new method because this fetch current user data is just only retrieving as the current user data but I want to retrieve any user data using a user ID and I just don't want to have this uh uid as the current user but it should be any user ID so I can just copy this uh method and paste it right here exactly here and I'm going to just uh uh add something like fetch any user data provider so let me just remove this current and this method is called Fetch any user data and in this case I don't want the uid to be the current user uid but it should be the user ID which I'm going to just pass it as parameter okay everything is okay right now and here I'm going to just say ref and then I can use the watch method to use this uh let me come here I'm going to just use this user data service provider and finally the uh fetch any user data and the user ID in this case is going to be just user ID and I'm going to just initialize it inside the post widget so everything is okay and when I get this uh it gives me a result of user model which I'm going to just call it user and I will also AWA this and make this method a sness and finally I can just return this user from this provider and everything should be okay now inside the post I need to you know inside this consumer widget use this RI to just you know retrieve the this provider so I'm going to just write uh let me see what was this provider any user data provider I can just use this and also let me just import it and when I use this provider it asks for a parameter because as you can see we added this uh extra parameter which is going to be the user ID ref is okay but I need to initialize this user ID and this user ID is going to be just video. user ID this is the user ID that I need to use and I'm going to just store this inside a variable called user model but this user model is not just a simple user model it is an asingle value so I'm going to also just write here that the type of this user model is this it is just not a simple user model it is a single value and later on I can just say user model and then I'm going to just use I'm not going to use when because I don't need that I'm going to just say when data and this method just gives us the data when we have it and it's not just checking the uh time when we we got error or for example the data is loading so it it doesn't care about that and it will only give us the data whenever we have it so I'm going to just use this when data and of course we get a value which is going to be just the user model so I'm going to just say user and finally I can just return this user so what basically I did was I I use this user model and I said whenever we get the data uh which is going to be which the data is going to be just a user I want the user to be returned and the result of this is going to be the actual user model that I need so I'm going to just call it user so let me see if there's an error and it says that a value of type aing value cannot be assigned to variable of type user model so I'm going to not I will not say it is a type of user model let me just use this user and actually I can use this user to initialize the values and I will first of all use it here I'm going to say value and display name you just need to use this value to get the actual value of this because it's an async value and now it's okay so this was the display name and I also need to initialize this uh uh per picture right here inside this circle aat it has another property called background image and I'm going to just use cache Network image provider and finally uh user. value. profile pick it's okay let me just remove this cons and add an exclamation mark right here so now everything should be okay let me just reformat The Code by putting some commas here and also I'll put some cons right here and here and also I will change the value of this uh which is going to be for uh the date published later on I will also change that but for now we don't need to care about it so everything should be okay and let me just run the emulator to check it out and as you can see everything is working and we are getting the first post which is going to be the title first video on a platform this is the display name this is the actual number of views and also I'm going to just say uh I just need to mention that this is the number of views so let me just open this post and this is uh where I need to show the number of views let me just take this I will use this string and later on like this I will say that this is a number of views actually not here but right here so now it also says that that's uh we got zero views and whenever we got zero views I can simply say no views so let me just uh do this as well I'm going to just uh have a condition right here to say you know whenever the views is equal to zero I want to I want to just display something like no views but if it is not equal to zero I just want to show and display the actual number of views in this post so let me just say video do views and if this is equal to zero in this case I'm going to just say no view but if it it is not right in this case I'm going to say and now that should be all right and as you can see for now we are getting no view because there is no VI in this post so this is basically the post we show a thumbnail and then we show profile picture title display name and number of views and also that did published but now what I want to do is whenever I click on this post I want it to be navigated inside a video and there I can just actually display the actual video that the user uploaded so let's work on this and create the video so let me just open this uh video and this is the starting code for this file and uh first of all I want to just uh create the navigation to this page whenever the user clicks on the post so I'm going to just uh wrap the this column with a gesture. detector to just say whenever user clicks on it I want to get a navigation to the video and let me just create this navigation okay so now when I click on this thumbnail we are just navigated to this page which is going to be the video and I will upload everything here uh and here I just need to display the actual video that which the user just uploaded and I'm going to just close all the an necessary pages so inside this video as you can see everything that we have uh right now for example the video is inside this app bar because I want to display it right here and then uh I will display some other stuff inside the body of this video okay so first of all let me just uh display the actual video inside uh here and for doing it I need to just import the video player package which I'm going to use in this uh project so let me just import it and first of all you have to install the package inside your pu. file and then you can use this package to display the video so let me just uh show you this video player package I'm going to just open it uh this is the video player package for the flutter and we are using it so let me just open the documentation and of course you can just use this documentation to learn how to use this package inside your PL project and as you can see first you need to add some installation and it asks for some permission for Android and also for the iOS so in my case I need to add this permission inside my Android project inside the Android manifest file uh and I believe that I already have added this package which basically it asks for an it asks for an internet uh permission let me just open the Android manifest file and I'm uh I just believe that I have already added this uh as you can see this permission inside the under manifest fault so just make sure to add the necessary permissions for your Android or if you have an iOS you just need to add the necessary permissions for your iOS okay so when you're done with this installation and you're good you can just continue and let's come to this example and as you can uh see here the first thing uh yeah here we can just find everything necessary for installation of this package and the first thing that I need to do is to just uh initialize this package inside my in so I'm going to just copy this this is everything for any solution and I will just create let me close this page first of all I will change this stess fidget into a stateful fidget and then I can create an in set so you are already I'm sure that you're already familiar with using this in set whenever we open the page for the first time this everything inside this in set will be triggered and I'm going to just uh copy everything right here and I need to create a controller so I'm going to say final video player controller and of course as you can see this video player controller is from the package video player and it's not of course final and I will also add an this Mark here to say that electron I will surely initialize this video player controller okay and then using this controller I can initialize this video player and what we have basically done is we said uh video player controller and then uh I did it using this nwork URL because we are getting this uh you know video from Network URL which of course in our case it is from the Firebase and this is going to be the video later on I will just change it to a real video but for now we are just using this uh Sample video from the package which is just uh a short video and then I initialize it and finally doing a seta set so uh using this our video player will be initialized and then I can just display the actual video and for doing it right now as you can see see I have only a container but instead of a container I can actual I can display the actual video right here so let me see where should I just uh display this video I believe I can display it right uh here or maybe not so let me just check it once so I can just display the video right here and I can just say uh video player and here I just need to initialize the controller which in this case is controller and I need to put an exclamation mark and of course I'm going to just uh I need to wrap this uh stack widget I believe with an aspect ratio uh this is the highest widget inside this appb so let me just wrap this with a aspect ratio and the aspect ratio for this uh widget is going to be just the aspect ratio of the video that we have so I'm going to just say uh actually I don't need to put the aspect ratio right here maybe I should do it just inside the video so I'm going to just wrap this video player with aspect ratio and the aspect ratio in here will be just the aspect ratio of this video so I'm going to just say controller. value. aspect ratio and I believe that's all right okay then uh right here it should just display the video and as you can see this is the video of a b and this is just the sample video of the a sample video which this video player package use it as a default and later on I can just replace it with the actual video which I have inside my database but for now it's going to be okay and for now let me just customize this page to make it a little more beautiful okay so I'm going to just minimize this wh that you can see it properly and here you can see the emulator and see the changes in real time so this is the title and uh let me just wrap this whole uh let me just wrap this title with a padding so I will give it a padding from the right side and we are having a padding only from the left side which is going to be a padding of 10 or maybe a padding of 12 okay then we have a number of views but beside number of views I also want to show the that publish time so we can see that when we publish this video so right here I can just copy it and paste it one more time and here I'm going to just say for example five minutes ago it's just the date published of this video and actually I don't need like this padding so I'm going to just say a padding of four from the left side and also here a patting of uh four from the right side so it's going to be okay and then I also want to wrap uh so I also want to have a pad from the top side for this row and I will give it a padding of something like eight and I think it should be a pading of five and I think that's all right okay then here we have the purle picture so this is exactly this circle aor I need to just uh make it a little bigger this profile picture and then we have this display name of the user who uploaded this video which is uh here like ah it's just a hardcoded and then we have the Subscribe button but before that I also want to show the number of subscribers that this user has so I'm going to just have one more text to say like for example one subscriptions okay and I just need to change the style of this text I will just first of all give it a Fone size of something like 15 and also I will change the fot we to something like w500 okay and then I can just wrap it with a padding to give it a padding from the right side and it's going to be just a padding of six okay everything is good I just need to add a spacer here because I want this uh subscribe button to be at the end and right now it is great and let me also give it a padding from the left side uh and it's going to be just a padding of six or maybe yeah that's all right I can have just a padding like this but the phone size I think it should be something like tur because it's yeah I think that's right now looking very well so this is the video page and later on I can also add something like a comment section because I want to have I want to display all the comments right here and I'm not going to work on it for now let me just work on this likes button because it's not looking very nice uh let me just find it yeah here we have this uh thumb up and also we have this thumb down but first of all let me just increase the width between these two I'm going to just give it a BD of like 15 and it should be inside a container and I believe I can add and increase this vertical uh padding of this container to something like 15 okay I think it looks better now let me also increase this weight a little more to something like 19 and now it should be better and when this video is liked I want this I want to just change the color of this th app but for now it's okay so now we have this and uh this is the video this is the title of video number of views that published profile picture of the user who uploaded this video display name number of subscriptions for the user uploaded and also we have a subscribe button and also we can like this video or unlike this video and also we have some other buttons and first of all let me just give a padding to this title okay so I'm going to just give it a padding from the top side and just a padding of four not more okay now it should be great and also this padding to turn right now it looks great and everything is good okay now the UI looks very good and let me just uh improve the user experience of this uh video whenever we click on a video I want some icons to appear because it's exactly like we have in the actual YouTube when you click on a video you can just for example pause or play the video you can move uh ahead or you can move just uh backwards so this is all the features that we have in the actual YouTube and I'll uh I just want to implement this inside my uh project that whenever I click on this some icons should appear and then I will be able to play the video and do some more stuff so let me just create them and first of all I will just remove this unnecessary inputs and then here I can just have some variables that I will use and the first one is going to be a bullion of uh is show icons so as I said I want to be able to show the icon and also just appear or disappear the icons whenever the user clicks on the whenever the user clicks on this video and then I also want to have a Boolean to say is playing so whe whether the video is playing or it is not playing and that's all right so first of all let me just work on this is show icons and I will just display some icons whenever I click on this video and first of all let me just create this icons which are just some images that I already have inside the assets of my folder as you can can see inside the assets I have icons and also I have images and of course once again if you have downloaded this project you have access to all of them and I will just use some of the images inside my project to display this play icon pause icon go ahead and go backward icons so what I basically want to do is to wrap this video player with a gesture detector or maybe I have already done it yeah I have this gesture detector to this whole video and right here I'm going to just say that if is show icons is equal to false in this case for example I want to display icons and whenever x equal to false I want to disappeared icons so let me just do like this that whenever s show icons is equal to false I want to display the icons inside this method and if if it is not equal to uh true I will do this method okay first of all if s ions is equal to true it means that we have the icons I want to just disappear them and when we don't have them I want to appear this icons but now first of all let's have those icons uh we have some stack widgets here this is the first one this is the next one so here I'm going to just in set of this container I can show the actual value and here I'm going to just display the icon of playing that whenever user clicks on it they will be able to play the video so I'm going to just uh use an image. assets and then I will just say assets and then inside it inside the images folder I can just show this play.png okay and this is the icon that we have it here so let me just change the color of this and I will change it to a color of white and now you can see it properly let me just change this to for example something like 170 and also the top should be something like 82 or maybe I should increase it yeah I believe right now it looks better so this is the first for playing the video and the next I also want to be able to uh head backward and also uh hit go forward so let me just create that one as well I will just copy this position and copy it two more times this uh this one is going to be for backward and next one is going to be for forward and it's just assets images and inside that I have go go back final and also the next one is going to be just go ahead final inside this I can just have go ahead final and of course I will need to change this positions for example will make it something like 30 and also this one do like uh let me say from the right side something like three so you can just uh do some stuff to have some trials and errors to find the exact positions of this three icons and it will of course take some time to have the exact position but later on you can have the uh you can just put it whatever you want so I can just increase it to something like 45 this one and also from the top side I want it to be like 85 or maybe I should increase it even more like something like 96 and this one to 55 so as I said before with some trials and errors you will understand the exact position of each one of them and also let me change this one I mean this one to something like 55 and also actually not 55 so I will just put it like 45 or maybe for8 and I can also change this one to like 94 so with some trials and errors you will find the exact position to have this icons and later on I also can organize it much more to make it more beautiful but for now it is okay now I want to be able to appear or disappear the icons whenever the user clicks on this video so I'm going to just select this uh exactly right here I believe that FS show icons is equal to true in this case I want to disappear the icon and for doing it I can just say s show icons should be equal to false and of course I will do a set set so if show can is equal to true I want it to be equal to false and if it is equal to false I will make it equal to true for this icons uh let me just uh make it clear that whenever we want to display this icons so I will wrap I will not wrap I will just only say that if show icons is equal to true I want to display this but if it's equal to false I will just show a size box it means nothing and I will do the same for the next one as well I will only say let me say like this that if s show icons is equal to true I it needs to be displayed but if it's equal to false I only want to have a size box and the next one will be exactly the same and right now when I click on it you can see it appears and when I click on it it will disappear so it's exactly like the YouTube and now I also want to be able to play the video so how can I just make it to play let me just resize the SS code that you can see the code properly I will create a meod right here to say you know first of all toggle video player so in toggle video player I will say if the video is playing I want it to be paused and if the video is paused I want it to be played for example right now the video is paused so when I click on it it should play the video but if it is playing the video when I click on it it should just pause the video so how can I do it I will just make a condition to say if I can just use the video player controller for this mean so I'm going to just say controller do value do is playing it just G as if the video is playing or not so I'm going to just say that if the video is playing I need to pause the video but if it is not the case else it means that the video is not playing I need to play the video so how can I make the video to be paused I'm going to just use this controller. value. pause I believe I just need to say actually I don't need the value I'm going to just say pause the video and that's all when the video is playing I want the video to be paused and also I will make a playing equal to false because the video is not playing anymore and I will also do a set it so if you're wondering why do I need this displaying you will see later on because I need to change the UI based on where if the video is playing or not and whenever the video is not playing I want it to be played so I can just use this controller do play the video and again I'm going to just make S playing equal to true and do a set step so now I have this toggle video player and I will just use this method on whenever I click on this play button so it's going to be exactly right here and let me just show it whenever I click on this the video is playing and when I click it again it will just stop the video when I click again it will play the video and when I click it again it will just pause the video for me so this is exactly the behavior that I want to have so now I can also toggle video player and I can just you know make the video to stop and pause and now I also want the video to be go ahead and also go backwards so let me just create some meod for it first of all I will create a meod to say go backward and the next one is going to be go forward so how can I create this Behavior to make the video go backward and also go forward first of all let me just use it so the go back word is going to be used exactly here go back final right here and also in this one for the go ahead final I can just use go forward to create this Behavior I just need to take the position of the video that we are in right now and then I will add a duration to it for example it can be a duration of 1 second or any seconds that I want for example in the actual YouTube we have the functionality to go ahead 5 seconds and also 10 seconds you can change the the settings so uh default it is 10 seconds but of course in this video I'm not going to use like 10 seconds and I will just use one second so if you're not understanding just follow along to get what I'm saying what exactly I need to do is first of all I need to get the position of the video that we are in of course it's a type duration so I'm going to just call this position and then I can use the controller to say value and then position and this position will give us the exact uh position of the video that we are in for example if I have played the video and it is at the half of the video it will say me exactly that we are at this position of the video and it is played and now that I give uh I have access to this position I want to add a duration of for example 1 second to that position so now this position is going to be equal to the position that we had but plus a duration of like one second and then I will just say the controller I will just use this controller and I will use this S2 and this S2 uh method is just a meod from this video player package and it will just make the video to go and jump on a specific part of the video uh which takes an argument of position so I can just tell this video to jump on this part of the video and that part is going to be just this position okay so everything is done for going backward let me just explain to you what again that what I have done here I just use this controller to get the position of the video the video that we are in and then I st it inside this position variable and then I say okay the position the current position that v in plus a duration of 1 second should be stored inside this position so this is the new value of the position and then I just use the seek to method to jump on this new position of the video actually for backward I don't need to use the plus but I need to use the minus because we are not uh going forward we're going backward and then I can exactly do the same for the going forward but with this difference that in this Cas I want to have a plus so we are going forward let me just do a hot rest so click on this and it will just navigate us right here we are also getting some bottom error flows which I need to fix later on as well so as you can see it's working perfectly fine and we have this and also this button should be also working that we can just go forward and also go backward but to see it properly I just need to show a progress indicator right at the end of this page to see on which uh position of the video are we currently in and uh just to see the progress of the video and for doing it I can just create this video progress indicator inside this video screen so as you can see I already have this uh align widget and inside that that I only have a simple container which there is nothing inside it so I can just replace this container with a video progress indicator which of course this uh widget is just uh came from the actual video player package that we just installed and here first of all I need to assign a controller that we can use the controller that we just created and also the all scribing will be equal to true so now it should be good and you can see that right now we have this progress indicator and I just need to bring it down at the bottom of this page but before that let me also uh change some colors of it for example the plate color should be equal to rate so I just change the property called colors and it takes just a video progress colors widget so I just need to add this and right now we have a plate color which I'm going to just use a color of R and also I need to just change the buered color which this one is going to be equal to gray a color of gray so basically this color of red is the color of the video which is just passed on and also the buer color is the color of the progress indicator that we have not seen the video yet so you will understand once we have it okay as you can see this is the video when I just click on it you can see that it just uh goes away and right now this part of the video has been seen and this gray part has not been seen it's okay I just need to just relocate this progress indicator because it's it's not really looking very nice at the top of this video and I want it to be just right there just like the actual YouTube that we have so for doing it I believe that I can you know use a size uh I can just use a position let me just wrap this with a position vdet and then I can just some uh change the top for example to something like Ed but as you might know uh first of all let me just see if it's working or not actually I really don't need uh this position and it should be just working perfectly but I don't know what's the problem now so I have to just relate this video progress indicator and put it exactly right there and I also believe that I can just take this aspect ratio so let me just take this one and instead of that I can just wrap it right here so I'm going to just wrap it with the aspect ratio and then put it right here maybe that just solve the problem yeah it's completely okay and right now we have this progress indicator at the bottom of the video which is really looking very nice and it's exactly like the YouTube and I can just play the video and it's just going on and I can just do like this and using this button I can just go backward so now that everything is set up and I can just play the video we can see the progress indicator right here and everything is just okay let's just uh initialize the actual value what I mean is just let's just use the actual video and also the actual display name profile picture of the user who just uploaded this video and everything so first of all let me just replace this with the actual video so let me just create a Constructor and I can just create a video model and I'm going to just call it the video and I will just generate Constructor for this parameter and I can use this video to get the actual value of this video and instead of just this uh just a hardcoded video which is uh we are getting from the internet I can just replace it with the actual video and I'm going to just say the video URL so this is what we really need and instead of the hardcoded B video we are getting the actual video from our database so right now we are getting this error in the PST because I need to initialize this so let me just initialize the video right here inside the PST and the video is going to be just the video and right now it is okay and everything should be really fine and let me just do a hard Restort when I click on a thumbnail we are navigated to this page and here we should be able to see the video yeah and as you can see this is the video that we just uploaded inside the database and we are seeing the actual video and I can just uh uh play the video and I can just stop the video I can just go backward oh this is just uh is been wrong and uh this is going forward and also this is getting backward so I just need to replace this too so and I can just do it real quick uh inside the video I just need to replace this go forward and also go backward uh Ms this is not going to be go forward it is go let me just see it is not go backward it is the go forward and also the next one it's go backward let me just change it okay and now everything should be good and I this is going forward and also this one is getting backward the video and I can just play it or I can just pause it so now everything is okay and I also need to change this other stuff for example number of views that published and uh title and and other things and first of all let me just change the title and I just uh use the actual title that we have here so let me just do that real quick here we have the title A hardcoded how to learn FL quickly and instead of that I can just use widget. video. tile and the next one is number of views so I can just say use like this to say uh widget do video do views and also here I'm going to just say views that we can understand this is is the number of views because this one is just an integer and right now we have this zero views and again I'm going to just uh give it something like this to say if number of views is equal to zero I just want to display no View and for doing it I can just create a condition once again to say if the widget. video. views is you know something like equal to zero in this case I want to just display no view but if it is not true I just want to display the number of views that we have here and for now it is no View and the next uh so I have this title I have number of views and the next I also want to just change uh number of subscriptions and also the Prof picture and the display name of the user who just uploaded this video and for doing it I need to once again use the uh provider of any user data provider so let me just do that real quick and for doing it I need to change this stateful widget into a consumer stateful widget and of course I will need to inut the FL R part package and I will just add a consumer right here and also a consumer here so now we are able to use the flut R part inside this video and I can just do it inside the build method right here and I will just use ref. watch and also the method that uh the provider I need to use is any user data provider and of course you are just familiar with it and how can we use it it takes a parameter and the parameter here is going to be just a user ID of the uh Channel who just uploaded this video so I can just say vet. video. user ID so now the result of this uh provider is going to be just an async value and of course we know that it is a in sync value of user uh model and now everything should be okay and I'm going to just call it user and now I can just use this user to initialize the actual value of the guy who just uploaded this video first of all I can change the profile picture so I'm going to just change the background image I will use the cache Network image provider and it's going to be just user. do profal p and it should be just all right the next I can change the display name of the channel who uploaded this video so for now it was just a hardcoded Ahmed amini but now we are going to just use the actual value and once again I'm using user. value. display name let's just put an exclamation mark here to say that this value is not going to be null and also I'm going to change the number of subscriptions to let's once again say user. value do number of subscriptions that we have here and let's see what's the problem here yeah of course because uh I just need to change it to something like a string because uh number of subscriptions is a list it is not a string so we can't use directly inside a text and I can just use it like this and I'm going to use a method called lent to give as the actual length of this list of subscriptions and also here I'm going to just write subscriptions and once again I'm going to just take the whole thing to say uh as you can see right now so we are getting this error and it will be just solved I'm going to just say if the number of subscriptions is equal to zero it should just be returned to something like no subscriptions but if it is not equal to zero for example it is one two or it is more than zero we just wanted to show the actual number of subscriptions for it once again I just need to create a condition to say if the user. value. subscriptions is empty so in this case I just want to say something like no subscriptions and let me just put an exclaimation Mark here but if it is not true it means that we have more than one subscriptions I just want to show this and now let me just do a hot restart and everything should be okay okay and we should be able to see the actual values instead of just hardcoded as you can see we are also getting some errors while the data is loading in the post and also the long video screen I will also solve that it is just uh some temporary errors that while we are retrieving the data we get that and also in the video we get that error as well but as you can see we are getting the actual value this is the title first video on a platform this is the actual number of views no view for now this is the purple picture the guy who just uploaded of course the display name is Ahmed amini and also we have no subscriptions and this is the video so that is all right uh but let me also uh add some improvement to the user experience of this video and also post and the first thing that I want to do is to just change whenever we are getting the video uh whenever the data is loading and we getting the video I just want to show a loader let me just find that and it is right here instead of just simply a size box I want to use and return a loader widget here to say okay now it should just return a loader and also I can just wrap it with a padding if we need that as well and I will just give it a padding from the top side and it's going to be a padding of 10 okay now it should be good and let me also this long video screen as you can see we have this uh conditions to say if the data is not if you don't have an uh any data it should just return an error pitch if the data is loading we should have a loader and also when we got the data we want to show a lp. builder so everything is okay right here but maybe it's not okay in the post uh I believe so because uh we are getting the error whenever we upload whenever I do a h rest start I get some temporary errors it means that we need to add some more conditions but this one should be okay and the error should be from this uh part whenever we are retrieving the data so we are saying that if snapshot. has data is uh not true and also let me add one more condition to say or so this is basically just or to say if snapshot the data is equal to null if we got these two cases if the snapshot. has it is not equal to true and also if the snapshot data is equal to true I mean uh if you have both these two cases if snapshot. has data is not true and also if snapshot. data is equal to null in these two cases I just want to return an error pitch and when we are getting the data I mean when we are just uh waiting for the data I just want to return a loader and in other cases whenever we are getting the data I just wanted return as list with Builder so now everything should be okay as you can see we are getting this loader but right now we have the data so it should not be just displaying uh actually I forgot to add one more step because you know whenever we are uploading this video page I should add one more condition to say if the data is initialized if our controller is initialized in that case we want to show the video so let me just create this one as well this is not actually true so I need to just take all of them this padding widget inside which I have a load and I'm going to just uh use once again this size box because that's completely all all right here and I don't need to change it but actually I need to change it whenever the data is not initialized so let me just add this condition once again I think it should be inside this aspect ratio I think that is a great place to do so yeah that's right let me just add this condition to say the child of this preferred size widget should be an aspect ratio but that is only true whenever the data is initialized so I'm going to just say if the controller do uh value do is initialized it means that if the data is initialized only in this case I want to show this video and everything related to it but if it is not initialized I just want to show a simple padding widget and that is it and now it should be okay let me just do a h rest start and let's see if it is working properly like you want it to work okay right now we got this thumbnail when I click on the thumbnail we are now we get to the actual video and right now as you can see this is working properly I just need to add and increase the padding so let me just do that as well I just need to have a padding not from the top side but actually from the bottom side and it's going to be a padding of something like 90 maybe you can just do some trials and error you will you will understand how it should be and I can just make it something like 100 and right now it is okay and right now because the data is not initialized we are just seeing this uh loading but whenever the data is loaded and we got the actual video on that Guess The Video will be uh display so right now it is working well and there's no problem okay now I'm going to just upload two more videos to this platform because I want to just show you one more feature that is happening inside the video and let's just upload this new video I'm going to just click here upload a video and then I can upload this a very short video now I just need to enter a title and also description something like this is our second video and also uh and also the description is something like uh optional I can just leave it empty and it's not a big deal the next I'm going to just select the thumbnail and it's again and once again it's going to be just this thumbnail because I don't have any other image inside my emulator and of course it's not a big deal now I'm going to just publish this video and now this video should be just uploading and I can also check it inside my fire press console this is my database and I can just do I refresh this PCH to see if the video is uploaded or not and I believe the video should be just uploaded so let me just do a hard rest start to check it inside the emulator yeah as you can see the video is just uploaded this is our first video which says first video on the platform and also this one is the second video and the title is just this is our second video of course the thumbnails are the same let's wait for the thumbnail to be uploaded it may take a while because my internet connection is just weak right now but it should be just done and right now I have two videos uploaded by the same guy D Ahmed amini this is my account which I uploaded two videos using these two accounts and what I want to just show you is if I click inside the video uh right now you can see that I'm only seeing only one video but it's not the same inside the the actual YouTube clone because in the YouTube when you just open a video you can see other videos or the suggested videos just at the bottom right here so right now it is empty but it should not be like this and I should just upload some more videos right here so it can be any video but not the above video it's just uh and it is just like the actual YouTube that we have in our phone so right now what I want to do is to just uh using a stream Builder show the other videos at a bottom of this page so how can I do that I just want to come here and I believe that after the padding inside the list view I can just use an stream Builder to show the other videos right here so I'm going to just create an stream Builder and the stream is going to be just once again the inance of fire fire let me just create this and then I'm going to go inside the collection of videos and of course videos we have to take the Snapchats but using this stream we are getting actually all the videos but that is not what we actually want because we want to get all the videos but not the above video not this video and of course the reason is clear so how can I do it I can just do it using uh I just need to add a condition and I'm going to just do it using this word method and I'm going to just say that I need to take all the videos inside this CL collection but except one video and it is the video that the user ID is the same the user ID of the above video so I'm going to just say where user ID is not equal to the widget. video. user ID so I'm going to I'm going to just explain one more time what basically I say here is that I want to take all the videos inside this collection but not the video which the US user ID is equal to the user ID above I don't want to take that video and finally I just take all the snapshots of this video okay the next is inside the Builder and here once again I can make some conditions here to check if the data is loading or if we are not getting the data first of all I'm going to just say if snapshot. data I mean snapshot. has. has data is not equal to true it means that we don't have any data or maybe snapshot. data is equal to null so I'm going to just check that if we don't have any data I just want to return an error pitch so I'm going to just say error just return this error pitch this is the first condition the second condition is going to be the the time when the data is loading and I'm going to just say if the snapshot. connectionist said is equal to okay connectionist waiting it means that the data is not loaded yet in this case I want to just return the loader and finally when we have the data I just want to return post again actually I want to return a list V Builder here so I just need to show a list and in this case I'm going to just return a list without Builder and the item Builder is going to be just here I will return the post and of course it takes a video and I have to initialize that one as well and the video here is going to be just something like let me create it here actually right here I can say snapshot. data. docs here I'm going to just take all the docs it means this docs is all the videos so I can just call it something like videos map but here it wants me a video model okay so right now that I have this videos map I can just convert it into a something like a video model so I'm going to just use this map method and then I take each of this video and here I can just say video model actually like this video model I will use the from map method and here I'm going to just say video. data okay so I have to just return this the result of this uh from from m method and the result will be added to the something like videos and here I can just say videos and I will take each index inside here so let's see what's the problem here actually it should be a list right now yeah I have to convert this into a list I just forgot it now everything should be working so what I did here was uh first of all I took all the docs which is of course all the videos and then I stored it inside this videoos map map and then I just use the map method to just convert each of these videos into a video model and then convert everything into a list and inser it inside this videos list and finally I just returned it each index of these videos to this post so now everything should be working and let me just also put some Comas here to just format the code and everything should be all right now right now so let me just do a hot restart if I open the first video not only this video but I should also see the other videos at the bottom of this page but right now it's not doing that so let me just check if there's any problem here okay actually I got the error that why we are just getting this the reason is just I made a mistake right here uh in the condition right here I said that if the user ID is not equal to the user ID of this guy so it's completely wrong because I should not say this because uh in this case you are saying that if the videos are uploaded by the same guy it should not be uh displayed here but that's wrong I should not use the user ID but I should use the video ID and here I'm going to just also say video ID and right now it should be working perfectly yeah as you can see it's working right now and that was the only problem that I used the user ID in a setad of a video ID so just make sure to make it right and right now I can see the other videos this is my the actual video and then at the bottom I can see the other videos as well so let me just upload another video okay if I want to just upload another video here this is going to be 10 seconds video long enter a title I'm going to just say our third video and the description I can just leave it empty because it's optional and then I have to select the thumbnail and I'm going to just select this one and finally I can just publish the video let me also do a refresh to this Firebase console to see if the video is uploaded or not and we can just check it inside this console okay now the video is uploaded and this should be it this is the second video and maybe this one is the third video that I just uploaded yeah that's right this is our third video and if I do a hard Restort here I should be able to see the video okay right now as you can see we got three videos this is our third video our first video and also the second video and when I open a video for example let me just open the first video on the platform as you can see I can also see the other videos our third video and also the second video I can see both and they're just displaying at the bottom of the actual video that we are just playing so it is exactly how it is inside the actual YouTube so I we also got this feature and this is the first video in the platform this is the third video and also this one is the second video and I can just scroll through this page now that I have this Behavior I also want to add the comment feature to this platform so at the bottom of this video right here I need to display a comment box and then when the user clicks on it they should be you know it should be open a modal bottom sheet and then inside that users should be able to uh post their comment and also their they can see their first comment and also inside the bottom sheet they will be able to see all the comments inside a specific post and video okay let's start on the comment section okay right now that we are done with the video we can just go and start creating the commment feature and it's going to be the next feature that I will create to this project so the first thing I need to upload a comment and then I can show it and display it into the UI so first of all inside this upload folder I can add a new folder and I'm going to just call it comments and Okay so it should not be a file let me just remove this I'm going to add a folder to this upload folder to say it should be called comments and I will put just everything related to the comments inside this folder and the first thing I need to create a model for this comment as we had for the video and also we had for the user I need a model for the comment as well and I'm going to just call it comment model okay so let's create this comment model which I'm going to just call it comment model and this model is going to have five fils one is going to be for the video ID the comment text and uh let me just create them one by one so the first one is going to be the common text and we want to know which comment has the user just posted the next one is going to be the video ID of course it's all it's again an string uh why I'm just creating a video ID field it's because we want to know the comments are belong to which video and for doing it I need to have this video ID here as well and the next one we also need a comment ID just we had in the video ID and also we had in the user ID we again need an ID for the comment as well so it's going to be comment ID and the next I just want to show that display name and also the perpose picture so I'll also add this one as well display name and also the next one is going to be profile picture so I have this five fil inside this model and let me just generate Constructor for it and that's it I also need to just generate Json calization and I don't need this two so let me just remove them and also remove this unnecessary import so inside this model I have a comment text a video ID a comment ID display name and the profile picture and now I can just go and actually upload this comment so let me just create a repository and I'm going to just call it comment repository and here I have this class again comment repository let me just create an inocence of Firebase uh o and also Firebase firer because we are going to need it inside this repository and I will have final Firebase fir store which I'm going to just call it fir store and the next I also want to add or maybe we don't need a fire so maybe it's okay let me just generate a Constructor and now we have this fire Ser now the first method that I need to create here is going to be a method to just upload everything inside the Firebase F store so I need to create a method called uh upload comment to firer and using this method I can just upload this comment inside the firer and of course it going to be just a synchron this and now I can use a wait to say okay I will go inside the fire store and I will just create a new collection called comments it's going to be the third collection that we have inside this project then I need to have a doc and this Doc is going to be a comment ID so as I said I need a comment ID here and then I'm going to just set everything inside this collection and before that actually I need to create a Comm an inance of commment model here so let me just create it it's uh going to be the type comment model I will just call it comment and it's equal to comment model and here I'm going to just use the two map because I want to add uh first of all let me just create an inance of this and then I will need to use that to Method so here I have an inance of comment the comment model and I have to initialize this values the comment text video ID comment ID display name and perect picture and I'm going to just fill all of them using parameters okay let me just put a comment here to re format the code here and then I can just have some parameters here and using this parameters I will just initialize the values and all of them are going to be just required the first one is uh the for commment text the next one is going to be for the video ID the next one is going to be comment ID or actually I can generate the comment ID here and I don't need to uh pass it as a parameter I can just do it right here and the next one is going to be just uh the profile picture and also display name so let me just create this one as well this is for the display name and also the last one is going to be for the profile pick okay right now I have all of them now let me just generate a common ID here as well and as you know I need to import The UU ID package and using this package I can just generate any random number or everything I want so let me just create one here right here before the inance of comment model I can just uh have any string I'm going to just call it comment ID and it's going to be equal to this uu ID and then I can just use the V4 and to just generate a random uh string for me and I can just use this comment ID right here okay so right now that I have everything done here when I want to set the data actually I can use this in sense of common model this one and then I can use the two map method to just send everything inside the firester database and and of course it should be just familiar with this because we already did that with the user and also we did that for the video okay so using this I will just send everything to the farest database and now I need to create the UI of the command page so now I need to create the UI of the comment page because I should be able to use this method right there but before that let me just create a provider for this comment repository it's going to be called comment provider and it's equal to a simple provider and I'm going to just return the comment repository the fire store is going to be just fire store fire firester do inance let me just create an inance of this and right now everything should be done all right so now let me just create this commment page UI and actually this commment is not going to be a page actually it's going to be just a model bottom sheet and of course you should be familiar with that I'm not going to create a page but I'm going to just create a model bottom sheet first of all let me just open this video and as you can see inside the project whenever I I open a video uh right here be before I display the other videos exactly right here I want to have a box and when the user clicks on the box they will be able to open this model bottom sheet and the comment sheet and then also they will be able to see the first comment right here inside this box it's exactly like the actual YouTube so they are able to see the first comment or sometimes the most popular comment right inside XEX boox okay so let me just create that uh I believe that after this row yeah so after this row I should be able to create this box let me just see if it's okay so this one is the row and then I have single Char scroll view or maybe I should do it outside this padding yeah I believe this is a good place here I'm going to just write a comment to say comment box I'm going to just create it here and it's going to be basically just a container it's not uh something hard I'm going to just create a simple container I just need to give it a color of gray and I also need to give it a height and also a weight the height is going to be something like 45 and also the we is going to be something like 200 yeah this is the box which I need and of course I will change the color and also I'm going to just give it a padding and also I need to add a border radius inside it first of all let me add a decoration and here I have a b radius and I will just give it a b radius of something like maybe 14 it's a b radius from the old sides and it's going to be a circular of for in and that should be all right and of course I need to put this comment inside this decoration because otherwise it will give us error okay I have this actually this 14 is a lot let me just put it something like eight and right now it should be okay I also need to add a padding I mean I need to wrap uh this container with a padding because I want it to have some distance from the left side the right side and also from the top and bottom bottom side okay let me just have a padding here and it's going to be a padding of symmetric and then horizontally it will be in eight and also vertically I will have a padding of 12 and it looks like this I believe it's beautiful and I just need to change the color of this uh container because this deep gray color is not looking very nice and I will just give it some shade of something like maybe 200 let me just see or maybe a shed of 300 it should look perfect yeah right now it looks more like the actual U and when the user click on this container this should should be just uh able to open that model bottom sheet. comment sheet so I will just wrap this container with a gesture detector and in the onta property when the user clicks on this container I want them to be able to open a comment sheet okay so when the user clicks on this container I just want to show a model bottom sheet and the context is context and the Builder I will just return a comment sheet here and of course I need to create this common sheet right now okay so let me just create uh actually this common sheet and right now let's just scroll up let me find this content and right here I need to add a new folder because as you already know I have different folders for the content and also for the upload I have three folders inside the upload one is for the comment for the long video and for the short video and exactly I have these three folders inside the context because inside the content folder because I want to just display all the contents right here so here I'm going to just add the new feature I mean the new content which is going to be the forur the comment and in the next tutorial I will also add the short video but for now let's work on the comment and here I will just add a file called comment sheet so now let's create the UI of this comment sheet and it's going to be really easy it's not that hard and let me just create an set this and I will just call it comment back to the video I need to import this and error should be gone now here I'm going to just return a container because it's as I said before it's not a page actually it's just a simple container and inside this container and inside this comment sheet I just want to have uh first of all I will just write and add some text like comments and also I will add a text to say remember to keep comments respectful on this stuff and at the bottom of this comment sh I just want to have uh a text field which inside that user will be able to actually add its comment so we'll have a profile picture of course the profile picture of the current user and then we will have a text build and also a button which all user to actually upload the comment to the fire database so let's create that it's going to be really easy inside this container the child is going to be just a column and inside the children first of all I will have a row and inside this Row first of all I can have a text to just say comments and I will also change the style that style is going to be have a font size of 20 and also I will give it a front way of both so now I also need to add a button to this row and it's going to be just a close button which when you when the user clicks on this button they will be just navigated uh to the previous page so outside of this text I can just add an icon button and the onpress is going to be just empty for now and inside the icons I can just add an icon of close and let me just reformat the and now it should be okay and let me just show it inside the emulator that how this page is actually working when the user clicks on this container they will be able to see this uh container so this is actually the common sheet and actually the size is okay and right now this is going to be the comments and this is the button and let me just change the M xelement of this row and it's going to be just a main AIS element do space between and now it should be okay and I will also actually add some padding to this row let me just wrap it with a padding widget and we will have a padding of actually symmetry horizontally equal to 8 and also vertically equal to 12 and it should be good I believe and it's great the next I also want to add a text here to say remember to keep comments respectful and also follow our community and guid list it's the same like we have in actual YouTube and outside this row I can just added this text and it's going to be just remember to keep comments respectful and to follow our community and guideline so it's exactly like we have in the actual YouTube and let me just uh copy and paste it outside this padding it's the correct place and as you can see it's like this and I also need to actually add it inside a container so let me just take this and then I will create a container here and the childart of this container is going to be this text okay now I need to change actually the decoration of this container and I will just give it a color of gray with a shade of like 400 it's like this and it should be good actually and I also need to change the padding of this container and I will just give it a a padding from the all sides and it's going to be a value of six okay so right now it looks nice let me also just uh maybe it's correct and if I want to add some more installing to this container I will do it later on but for now it's going to be okay and at the bottom of this container I mean at the bottom of this column I just want to add a row and inside this row actually I can just create first of all a circle aor to show the dis the profile picture of the current user who is just uploading this comment and then I can have a text fi and at the end I can have a button to let user to actually upload that comment so first of all let me just create this circle aor and it will have a radius of something like 15 the next I want to give it a background color and the background color is of course gray and I will later on add a background image and it's going to be the purple picture of the current user but for now I'm going to just leave it empty like this and I can just increase this radius of this circle something like 18 and right now it should be better and I will just put all of them at the bottom of the pitch so I can just have an spacer here because I want this row to be at the bottom of this container not like here and it should be good and let me just wrap it with a padding and here I will have a a padding from the bottom side like a padding of 10 and also I want to have a padding from the right side it and also from the left side it so now it should be okay and it looks okay the next after the circle ofor I want to add a text field and this text field also has a decoration because I want to change the styling of this text field and of course it's a type of input decoration and here here first of all I will just change the border of this text field and here I need to add a class of input border actually outline input border and inside this class I have this Border Side which here I can just add a border side and then here I can just change the color so I will just give it a color of like gray it's okay now I also want to add a hand text so the hand text is going to be just something like add a comment and it will just let the user to know what's this text about and also uh and I also can just wrap this text f with a size box because uh I just wanted to have an a specific size and I will just give it a height of 45 and also a weight of 140 let's see let's see how it does it look like and it looks like this it's okay let me just increase the WID of this text field to something like 250 and I also can increas it to something like 265 actually not 165 265 and right now it should be okay and at the end I also want to add an icon button here to be able to send this comment okay right now it looks good and I can also just add a size box between this circle and the text field and it's going to be just right here and it just has a WID of 10 pixel and that should be all right and now let me just create this uh icon button at the bottom of uh at the end of this row and it's going to be just outside of this size box and here I can just have an icon button and the unpress is going to be just empty for now because I will later add the functionality to it but the icon is going to be just an icons of send and I believe it's a g icon let me also remove this Con from this padding and add the padding right here right here there there and also here so now I have this icon at the end and let me just change the size and also the color of this icon I will give it a color of green and also change the size to something like 28 let's see how does it look like uh let me just increase it to something like 35 yeah and I believe it should be great and actually I can also increase this uh the WID of this text bu to something like 280 or maybe 275 yeah so I believe this is really nice and now that we have the functionality here it should be great now let me also create a common tile whenever the user adds a comment so we need to have this comment tile that when the user clicks on this icon button they should be able to add the comment but we don't have actually the comment TI let me also create that right now and inside this comment actually inside the content I can have uh or I don't need any folder I'm going to just add it right inside the content so here inside the comments I'm going to just create a new file called comment TI and just like always let me just UT the material Dart and create the status widget I'm going to just call it common tile and here I'm going to just return container okay so let's see how this comment TI is going to look like it's a really simple think I just need to add a row to just uh create a circle Avatar a display name a dead publish and also the comment T so it's going to be really easy first of all the CH of this container is going to be just a column inside this column first of all I can have a row because I want to display a circle Avatar and the other stuff so let me first of all create the circle AAR it's going to have a radius of something like 15 and also a background color of gray the next after the circle aor I can actually create the display name which is going to be for now only a hard coded of Ahmed amini later on I can just give it the actual value of displ name let me we also change the style of this display name to something like this and I will give it a front sze of Ed and also I will change the Funway of this to something like Funway w500 that should be all right and the next after this I also want to add the de published of this comment so we should know that when this comment was published and again it's going to be a text to just say like a moment ago and right now after the row inside the column I want to just show the actual comment text that the user just posted and it's going to be once again inside the text to just say like uh first comment on the platform and I also want to add an icon at the end of this row so let me just create that one as well actually after this did publish of this comment I also want to have and icon because we have this in actual YouTube and I also want to have this and the icon is just called more width okay this is the name of the icon and I want to have it at the end of this row and also I would add an spor here okay that's going to be great and now I can just add my first comment so let me just open this commment sheet and at the bottom whenever the user clicks on on this send icon it's actually right this one when the user clicks on it I want to upload the comment to the fire store and here I can do it and first of all I need to change this stus fidget into consumer fidget because you want to read the the we want to just use the flod just like always to actually read the different providers here I'm going to just add this fidget RI and now I'm able to use this riff here and I will just say rev. watch and the provider that I'm going to use here is just the comment provider and now I can just use this upload comment to the fire Restort and as you can see I have some parameters to just initialize and it's going to be a comment text video ID display name profile picture and everything and let me just have all of them and actually I need three different sources to get each of this uh par first of all is a common text and of course it's going to be just the easiest one I just need to have a controller to this text field and for doing it I need to change this consumer widget into a consumer stateful widget so first of all let me just convert it back to the stess widget then I'm going to just change it let me just remove this widget dri as well now I have to change this estet into an stateful vget and now I'm going to change this stateful wiget into a consumer state full widget and I have to add consumer right here and also here right now it should be great let's also put some cons here to remove this blue warnings which makes our computer slow down and it's great now uh to initialize this comment Tex I just need to add a controller to it and right here I can just create that so it's going to be just once again to type text editing controller and I will just call it comment comment controller so I just created an instance of this text editing controller and now I can use this controller inside this text field right uh here and let me also remove this const and right now it should be okay so now I can just use this comments controller to initialize this comment TT so I'm going to just say comment controller. text and it's going to be the actual value of this comment the next I need to have the video ID and I can just have it using uh parameters uh and I need to create a new parameter here I'm going to just call it a video model and I need to initialize it and get the value from the previous page so let me just create this one and also generate Constructor now inside the video I need need to initialize this and the video here it should be vet. video and that's all right now back to the comment sheet I have this video and right here the video ID is going to be just something like vet. video. video ID and the final thing is the display name and also the profile picture I need this one as well and as you know this display name and profile picture should be the display name and the profile picture of the uh actually the current user because uh who is just sending and uploading this comment it's the guy who just uploaded this comment so uh this display name and the profile picture is exactly the data of the current user because only the current user is uploading the comment and for doing it I need to use another uh you know uh I need to use another provider here so let me just use this riat and here I need to have the current user data provider and I will just say when data when we actually get the data and this data is going to be just the user I want to take this user and actually I want to return that so let me just return this user and that should be all right and I will just store it inside a variable called user so now I can just use this user to initialize the value of display name and also the profile picture I will say user. value. display name and also I will do the same for the profile picture I have a user do value and also do profile picture okay that should be all right and everything should be good right now so right now I have this upload comment to the forer and of course it's going to be a future of void this method is a feature of void because it should be like this and then inside the commment sheet I need to make this method a wait and also asness this method so now everything should be good and let's test it out and let's see if it's working or not okay so now let's test it out if I add a new comment and I'm going to just say first comment and okay now if I just press on a send button let's see if the comment is added or not so now here it should be just added a new collection called comments and we should have the first comment called first comment let's check it out yeah as you can see we have this comments collection and this is the comment ID and this is all this stuff the comment TT is equal to first comment this is the comment ID as you can see we also have it here this is the display name of the user who uploaded this comment and also this is the profile picture and actually this is the video ID so everything is just working perfectly fine and right now I should also be able to display the comments because whenever we add a new comment we want it to display right here now I want to display this comments right after this text to say remember to comments respectful after that I want to just create an stream Builder and display all the comments so let's have this stream Builder and this stream is going to be just first of all let's create an instance of fireus fire store and then I'm going to just open the collection of comments and finally I can just take all the snapshots but remember uh like this I don't want to just take all the snapshots I want to have a condition here so I'm going to just use once again this word meod because I actually don't want to get all the comments but I want to have a condition to say I want to take all the comments but the video ID should be equal to the widget. video ID because as you know each video has its own comments and we just don't want to get all the comments in our database we just want to get each uh video's comments on that specific video I hope I'm clear because we want to get all the comments in a specific video so that's why I'm going to add this condition to say I want to take all the comments but the video ID should be the equal to video ID of this specific video and finally I take all the snapshots then we have a builder here and just like always I need to add some conditions here to say if the data is null or we don't have the data it's going to be the first condition to say if snapshot. data I mean if snapshot. has data is not true or snapshot do data is equal to null so you should know how does it work because I have done this before a lot of times and you should be just familiar with this which in this case I'm going to just return the error page because we don't have the actual data and there is some error the next I want to check if the data is loading so I'm going to just say if snapshot. connection is equal to connection set do waiting which in this case I want to just return the loader just like always and finally when we don't have each of these conditions the data is not having any data and it's not loading in this case it means that we have the actual data and here I just want to return a list with Builder and here we have this item Builder and also I want to have an item count and here I just want to display all the comments so how am I supposed to do so actually I can just say here we have snapshot. dat. dogs and then I can just store it inside a variable called comments map using this I just retrieve all the comments I want to convert this map into an actual comment model because we are working with models and not maps or this stuff so let me just converted into a map and first of all I need to use this map method to actually get each of these comments and I want to just return this comment and finally I will just uh convert it into a list and now it should be a list of commment models uh actually not like this I want to have a comment model yeah I want to have a commment model and use the from map method and the map is going to be just a commment do data I'm not going to explain this a lot because I have done this a lot so I'm going to just explain shortly I just get this comments map which is actually all the docs inside the collection of comments then I use the map method to just get actual each of the comments and then I use the from map to convert this map or everything into a commment model so I just converted to a commment model and finally uh I just turned it into a list so now I have a list uh of common models let me just specify the data type of this variable it's a list of comment model I'm going to just call it comments and the item count is going to be just comments. length and inside the item Builder I'm going to just return a comment tile and let me just open This commment Ti because we want to display all the information inside this comment tole and here I need to have a comment model as a parameter so let me just create that as well I have a comment uh uh model and I'm going to just call it comment and let me just generate a Constructor for it and here I have to initialize it and comment is going to be just equal to comments and each of these indexes so you should be just familiar how to use with list with. Builder it's not hard and now I'm going to just use the actual data of this comment to show the value first of all I need to initialize this background image and let me just create an cache Network image provider and the URL and the image of this cach network image provider is going to be just something like comment. purpose picture the next one is display name so it will have comment do display name and I also need to initialize the value for the de publish but I'm going to do it later on I'm going to I'm going to just wrap it with the cons and also this one and here I need to show the actual comment so I'm going to just say comment. comment text so now everything should be okay and let me just do a hot restart I open the first video and when I open this comment sheet as you can see I should be able to see the first comment but we are getting some error it means that there should be some problem here let's see if there is any problem okay so now I believe I I know what is the problem and again it's a very silly stupid mistake I just uh here inside a condition for this stream Builder I specified that where the video ID is equal to widget. video do I forgot to add a video ID here because we just want to compare if the video ID of this comment is equal to the video ID of this whole video and now everything should be good and as you can see this is our very first comment it was was a very silly mistake and this is programming and we can all sometimes make mistakes and we forgot some stuff and it start just a big deal and right now everything is great so we can see this is the first comment and actually it's not looking very nice so let me just change the styling of this comment and then everything should be great let me just open the comment tile and I also minimize the vs code that you can see the emulator properly as I'm just changing this comment tile and the first thing uh the first thing let me just remove this unnecessary container and the next I can just change this F size to something like 16 because it is really big and I also want to just increase the phone size of this a moment ago to this did published let me just add a text style to this one and first of all I will change the color to something like Gray or maybe blue gray okay now I also want to add a size box here and it's going to just have a BD of something like eight and it should be great now I can also just add a size box between this circle aor and this display name let me just add that one as well and here again we have a size box with a weight of eight and now let me also change this actual text and this comment and let me just find it this is going to be that common text and I will just wrap it with a padding and I just want to uh give it a padding from the right side but I'm not going to just give it a hard value because in that case it will be a lot it will just cause a lot of problems when we try down on different devices because of different dimensions that this stuff so let me just use media query here I'm going to just use media query do size of and then I can say where and then I'm going to just say give it a size of something like uh 07 0.7 size of this screen now it should be okay let me just remove this const from the whole page if there is any con let's see what's a problem here actually it's not a problem I just forgot to add this agenes so I'm going to just say padding is agenes do only and then from the right right side I can add this media query and actually this is a lot so I'm going to just use 0.6 and it should be great or maybe 58 okay right now it is great and it's working and I just also want to just wrap the whole column with a padding and I will just give it a padding from the top side and it's going to be a padding of seven because I wanted to have some distance from the top sides and while this one is not just changing let me just remove this padding from this column and instead maybe I should give this padding to this row let's see if it's working okay it should be great now I have this back and I will just want the the padding to be back on the column and I can just wrap the circle ofar with a padding as well and I will give it a padding of seven from the top side okay right now everything is cool and we have this comment feature done and it's great so let's work on the next feature so right now that we are done with the videos and comments and everything now I can just move on to the next section which is going to be the short video and now I have to upload the short video and then I will also display it inside the page and first of all I need to create a meter as you can see I already have this pe video I'm going to just copy it one more time and here I'm going to just change the name to Pig short video and here I'm not going to return the video Details page but instead I'm going to uh create a new page called page screen and I'm going to navigate to that new page so let me just come here to the short video feature as you can see I already have this widget folder inside the starting project as you can see inside which I have this my trim slider and it is a package and it is a vet that I have already created and I use it to let the user to triam the video as like they want so we can just go through this file and see how everything is written here I'm not going to go through it right now so right now I can create a new folder inside this short video and I'm going to just call it pages and create the first page here called sh video screen now I'm going to just input the material. dart and create an stad lless widget I can just call it V uh short video screen and just like always I can return an scaffold and then inside the body just like always a safe area then the sh is going to be a padding the padding is going to be just a padding from the top side and I'm going to just give it a padding of 20 just like always and then the child of this padding can be my column okay so right now I have this short video screen and I came back to this method and now in the peak short video method I'm going to just navigate to this short video screen so what actually I want to do is that whenever the user tap on this Method pictur video which I'm going to just call this method inside the upload section which I will show you uh whenever I call that meod I want to take a file I want to pick a video and then I want to just navigate to this short video screen so let me just open this upload bottom sheet as well and as you can see we already have this upload a video and whenever we tap on this button I pick a video but whenever the user picks a short video I want the other method which is called pick short video triggered so I'm going to just call this method and of course I will aoid this so that's all right let me also just run the emulator that I can show you right here okay so right now when I click right here I can upload a video and also create a shirt and when I click on a create a Shir I should be navigated to that page now I can pick a video when I click on this video I will be just navigated to this empty page because right now there's nothing inside this short video screen so now let me just work on the UI of this page and we are going to just create a lot of stuff here what I want to do inside this page is to create some functionality to let the user edit this short video and for doing it I need to use a flut package called video editor so let me just show this package to you really fast so this is a package it's the video editor version 30 and the latest publish was eight months ago so you just need to install this package inside your P demo file which I already have done it as you can see I have this package right here and uh just make sure to install this package to be able to edit the video and I'm going to just UT this let me just remove the unnecessary Pages here and I'm going to just UT the video editor package because I need to use this package to actually edit the video so now I import this package and then I can use it to actually edit the video and first of all let me create the UI and uh just tell you that how this UI is going to be look like first I'm going to create one botton at the left side to just navigate back and at the right side I want to create a circle a just to display the you know length of the video then I want to display the actual video and the center and then at the bottom I can just have the trim slider from the of course the video editor package and finally I'm going to just have a button which uh it's going to be just let us to export the video first of all I need to change this stess vet into St vet and it allows me to create the initialization of this package so let me just uh go inside this package as you can see uh right now that we have installed this package and of course this is the demo of uh how it looks like uh all the features inside this package and to just initialize this package it's really simple let me just do it real quick I just need to I can just copy this code from the package from the I can just copy the code from the documentation then I'm going to just paste it right there as you can see I have created a controller for this video editor package and then I don't want it to be like this and actually I want to have the actual ual video here which I can just get it from the parameters so I'm going to just create this one as well and uh this video is going to be the type short video so now I have to create a model for the short video just like I did for the video for the user and for the comment I also need to create a model for this short video so let me just create that real quick I'm going to put it inside a new folder called model and the only file here is going to be the short video model so in this model model which I'm going to just call it I'm going to just call it short video model I will have four fills it's going to be the caption the user ID of the guy who is just uploading this short video uh and also I want to have uh the user ID the caption the DAT publish and also this is Stu so let me just create them one by one the first one is going to be just the caption the next one is going to be the user ID the next is going to be the actual short video and the final one is going to be the type dead time and it's of course did published just like we have the for the comment and also for the long video now let me just generate Constructor for this and also I'm going to generate Json calization now I will remove this unnecessary parts and I can also remove this one so now we can use this short video model to actually get this video so I'm going to just specify the type of this to short video model and of course I'm going to just call it short video now I can generate Constructor and this is it and of course the name is short video just like always uh this initial uh initializing this video editor package is really similar to initializing the video player package they're really similar and there are not a lot of difference between them and I can actually do it inside the edit set for first of all let me create this uh video editor controller and I'm going to just call it editor controller okay and now I can just create an ed method and of course you know how this method is working and I'm going to just paste everything right there and remove this part and also I'm going to call this controller editor controller okay that should be all right let's see what's the error of course I should not call this one uh final and this should be all right and let's see what's wrong here yeah because this short video should not be the type short video model yeah actually I don't need to use the actual model here I will use it later on I can just call it the type file because it is a type of file uh the video that we're getting from the image Pier package is of course it gives us a file back so I'm going to just call this a file or I can also make it a string and just uh send the path here but I'm also okay with this one so now everything is okay I have initialized this and of course as you can see I have a minan duration and also a Max duration here and you know the short videos in YouTube the maximum size is going to be 60 seconds so I'm going to just change it to 60 and also the minimum duration here is going to be 3 seconds so it means that the users can upload any video with the minimum duration of 3 seconds and the maximum duration of 60 seconds okay now let me just check the package once again and I also have to do like this and it's going to just uh initialize the package completely for me so let me just copy this one actually I can just copy all this because I don't need to do it manually and I'm going to just pack it I'm going to past it right here and change the controller to editor controller okay now everything should be just all right and I will be able to use this package to edit the video and do a lot of stuff okay now inside the column that I have just initialized the package actually I can create the UI of this page and the background color of this scaffold is going to be black I want to have a dark theme here and then inside the column first of all I will create a row and then I will change the main access alignment to main access alignment do space between now that it's all right inside the children I will have one uh icon button and the icon for this is going to be just icons. Arrow back I just want to navigate back to the previous page whenever the user clicks on this arrow button and also I'm going to just create a circle Avatar and inside this circle AAR I just want to show the tri duration of the video because this is a video editor uh we are using video editor and I'm allowing user to edit this video and here I'm going to just show the trim duration and the radius for it is going to be just something like 18 and also I will give it a background color of something like blue G for now okay that should be all right let's see if it's working first of all let's see what's the error here I need to have a sh video which is going to be here right video now I should be able to see this let me just do a hot Resort now when I want to upload a short video I can choose this video and now I will be navigated to this page this is the uh icon button and also right here I can show the triam duration let me also change something here I want to just make this circular water is smaller and also actually I want to change this Arrow back icon as well so I can do that later on as well for now let me just wrap this row widget with a padding I want to have a padding from the both left and the right side and it's going to be a padding of right a padding of eight from the left and also from the right side that's all right now I have this one and actually inside the circle aatar I want to show the trim Direction but I'm going to do that later on for now it's going to be just empty the next I actually want to show the actual video here and to show the actual video I can just use a class from this video editor package so I'm going to just go outside of this r and then I can just use a class called crop grid viewer. preview and using this class I just need to initialize this video controller and I'll be able to show the actual video and as you can see this is going to be the actual video and of course I will have to change the aspect ratio of this uh video because short videos are actually uh doesn't have the aspect ratio of the long video so I will change that later on but for now okay we just have this uh video right here as well and also one other thing that I need to keep in mind is that I just want to display all of them whenever the data is initialized whenever this package is initialized so for doing it let me also do one more step here whenever I'm showing this column I just want to make sure that everything is initialized so for doing it I can just say editor controller do is initialized let's see if it if we have it or not here so yeah it's called initialize here so if this all the stuff are initialized in this case I only want to show this column but in other case I just want to display a simple size box and that's all right and just make sure that everything is okay and we will not get any error okay so now the next stuff after I have this is going to be just the trim slider and as you can see I already have this uh prebuilt fidget this stream slender and you can just go through this files and see how everything is working so I have this prebuilt fidget inside the starting project and then I can just uh create that trim slender after this video so I'm going to just uh uh use this trim slender and let me see what's it called and name of this class is just my trim slender so I can just import this and everything should be all right let's see what is I need to also uh initialize this controller which I'm going to just say editor controller and also the next parameter here is going to be a height I'm going to give it something like 45 and it should be all right for now or maybe that's all right and as you can see I can just play with this dream slender okay let me just go once again I will upload this video and I will be navigated to this short video screen and actually I can play with this short video and everything but for now it's not actually really working but it will be solved and it's not a big deal so the next thing I just need to create at the button at the end of done so I'm going to just create a container here I have a child of a text button I just want to create a text button with an unpressed which for now is of course empty and then the child it's going to be a text to say done and I just want to export the video whenever I click on this button and I also want to change the you know styling of this container I want it to be uh first of all let me have a decoration and a box decoration here I'm going to just give it a color of white and I also want to change the Border radius for this and I'm going to just give it a big border radius from the old sides and it's going to have a border radius of 18 I hope that's perfect okay so so let's see how does it look like I have it right here and I also want it to be located at the right side of the page so what I can do is to just wrap this container with an align withget and then I will change the alignment to you know bottom right and it should just change its location and as you can see yeah right now it's located at the bottom so now first of all let me just change the aspect ratio of this video because I want it to be like a short video and I can just do it when I'm initializing this uh package right here when I say initialize this video editor I can change the aspect ratio and the perfect aspect ratio for this is going to be something like 3 2 3.5 and I have just get that uh aspect ratio by trial an error and I believe that this is the perfect aspect ratio for this video let me just do a hard Resort now when I go to the same page of create a short and then right here you should see that the aspect ratio is actually like this but it's not really looking very nice so let me just change it so I think that this aspect ratio is great and it's looking better this 4 to five this aspect ratio of 4 to 3.6 and it's actually looking like this and of course it's better than previous one you can actually change this uh numbers and you can just have your best aspect ratio now I also want to have a spor vet right here for this crop grid View and it will just make this dream sler go at the bottom and actually this is not what I want so I'm going to also have another spacer right here and let's see how does it look like right now and it looks just perfect and the way I want it to be at the top we have this arrow button and also the circle aor at the middle we have this video and at the bottom I have this stream sler and also this one and actually I also need to to uh give a padding to this uh bottom at the end so let me just wrap this container with a padding as well and I will just give it a padding of something like 12 from the bottom side and that should be good for now okay so right now we are done with the UI and let's work on the logic so I want to export the video whenever I click on this done button so I need to create a method called expert and I'm going to just create it right here and it's going to be called export video and of course it's going to be an as this method and I just want to trigger this method whenever I click on a button done right here so I'm going to just replace this with this right here so now let's work on the exporting video and it's going to be really simple and I can just use the package Video Editor to do so and we can use one of IT classes and of course some other classes of this video editor package to export the video and of course if you just to know uh there's also a separate package in flutter for just exporting video of course uh it can do a lot of other features it's a package called fmm Peg and that package is mainly focused on exporting video of course it can do a lot of other things as well so it has a lot of features but mainly that package is used to export video but for now because we have already used this video editor package we can also export our video using this package and we can use one of its classes to do so so let's just s exporting video and the first thing I want to do is to just create a configuration so I'm going to just use one of the classes from this package called video fmpg video editor config and just using this class I need to initialize the controller here which I'm going to just call video Ed I mean editor controller and I can just get a config so I'm going to just store it inside a variable called config now that I have access the config actually I can get a method called uh get execute uh config and now the result of this method is going to be just an execute so I'm going to just once again store it inside a variable called execute and now that I have done this finally I'll be able to get my command so I'm going to just write final string command and it's going to be equal to execute do command of course I have to make this method a wait because we don't know when it it's going to be done and now I can use the command and using this command I can actually export my video so I did all these steps just to take this command and now I have it now the actually process of exporting video will start from here which I will use a class called ffmpeg kit so I'm going to just use this method and of course if you can see here we just uh also exported this one because it's necessary uh right here I can use the execute async method so I'm going to just just use this method so now I have used the class of FMP EG kit that and then I have used this CL this method called execute asnc and this method would actually export the video for us and as you can see it has one required parameter which is the command which I just already created now this method also has some other parameters which I need to use and the second one is going to be just a method and of course it takes a session so I'm going to just write session right here because it takes that and right inside this method I can actually see if the exporting process is a success or it's a fail or whatever and I can also have some more parameters the next one is going to be just null because I didn't need it and the next parameter and the final parameter which I need here is going to be something that gives us a status so I can see whether uh what is the progress of exporting video I can actually and Visually see the progress of exporting video and the next one is just for this one so uh as I said this execute aing will export the video for me and it has one required parameters which is the command which I already generated and then in the second one it takes me it takes a session it means I have access to a session and using it I can actually see if the exporting process is a success if I can actually export the video and or not the next one I don't need and the final one is the status so I can actually see the progress of exporting a video so right now first of all let's actually see see if I can export the video or not and for doing it I can actually use decision to get a return code and I will store this return code inside a variable called code and of course it's going to be the type return code it is a data type generated uh created inside this package and of course I'm going to just call this code and make this a weight and also I will have like this to just say we will initialize this variable and also I need to make this method a sign so now I have a code and this return code will just tell us if the return code was a success or not and I can just uh make some conditions here to actually check that and I'm going to just say if the return code do is success and here I will just put the code if the return code. is Success it means that if the exporting process was success and we actually exported the video I'm going to just export the video right here so this is our first condition and the second condition is just else if the exporting process was not a success and we will not and we did uh and we were not able to export the video and here I'm going to just show some error to the user so we have these two conditions if you can export the video or we will just show some errors to the user and right now let me also create some variables here first I want to just accurate a variable for ex exporting it means if we are exporting right now and I want it to be a type of value Notifier and if you wonder why I didn't need to use this kind of value Notifier I'm using it because later on I want to display it inside the UI and I need to use some listables and for using listables I need this variables to be the type of value Notifier and it will just help me to you know uh display the values in real time to the UI and you will see that later on so this value is going to be just false for now and of course it's a type bullan I have an is exporting it's a type value identifier of bullan and initially it's equal to zero I mean initially it's equal to false and also I'm going to just have this once again one more variable and this time I want to have I want to show the exporting progress and again it's going to be just a value Notifier initially it will be equal to zero and the type of it the data type is going to be just double okay so right now now I have this two and let me just see how can I use it first of all the is exporting uh whenever I start the process of exporting video I want this is exporting to be equal to false so I'm going to just say as exporting do value should be equal to of course it should be true because it's initially yeah because initially it equal to false and when I start the process of exporting video I want the value of it to be equal to true and I need to use this value because of course it's a value Notifier and when the exporting process is done I want this is exporting that value to once again become equal to false okay and here in the status I also want to have a show the progress of exporting video so I'm going to just say exporting progress do value should be equal to here I just need to show the actual value of exporting video and I can just do it using a class uh from the config and here I'm going to just use get fmpg progress and here the time is going to be just uh this status I can use this status to uh get the actual time and I'm going to just say status do get time and also I want to convert it into an integer so like this I can just actually get the actual value of exporting progress so this should be good and one last step whenever I get some errors I'm going to just show some error to say show error snack bar and the message is going to be just something like failed uh video cannot be exported I will show just this error and whenever I can actually export the video I want to navigate it to and I want to navigate to a new page called video Details page and inside that page I can uh fill out the other fils for that short video for example because in this video because in this page we only export the video but in the the next page I also want to fill out the caption and also uh the de publish so other stuff so I need to also have another page for completing the sh video fields for ding that I'm going to just uh create a navigator so I'm going to just say navigator and here I need to create a new page to navigate so I'm going to just create that page as well inside the show video inside the pages I can create the second page called the short video details page and as I said inside this page I can actually fill out the other parameters and other fills inside let me just uh import the material Lo dot create an setet and I'm going to just call it short video detail pitch and now just like always I can return this safe area and then padding and here I'm going to just give it a padding from the top side and of course it's going to be just a padding of 20 that's all right now let me just uh create this navigation and I will just say okay just navigate to this short video Details page that's all right and let me just put a cons here and that should be all right and now everything is okay let me also remove this error and what actually I have done here is let me just go to it once again I want to export the video and initially I have put the S exporting value equal to true because we have started a process of exporting video and then then I have created an configuration for this and then once I have this command I have used the actual meod of execute Asing which let me just export the video and this command is going to be just the first required parameter the next I have some other parameters as well and in the second one which is going to be a function I I can actually see if the exporting Pro process is a is a success or not and I can just do it using this code and I will say if the return code is success I can actually make this exporting equal to false and navigate to this short video Details page which inside this page I can actually fill out the other fields for the short video like the caption and other things and if it's not equal to success and if it failed to export the video I'm going to just show an error to say failed video cannot be exported and also here I can actually see the status of exporting video so that's going to be all right and everything should be good for now I will also specify the return type for this Expos video and it's going to be just a future of void and now everything should be okay and let's check it inside the emulator so let me just run the project so now when I want to upload a short video I can choose my video I will choose this one and then I will be navigated to this short video screen and I can modify this like I can change the icon specify which parts of the video I want to just uh get and I can just remove the other parts and when everything is done I can just hit the down button to actually publish the video and when I mean to actually export the video and when the video is being exported I will be navigated to this page which is short video Details page and of course for now it's going to be just a blank scaffold but now I can actually create the page and first of all at the tight I mean at a appb of this I want to create some stuff so let me just create an upo and here I have a title which I'm going to just give it a text to say video details and actually this is going to be the video details let me also give that a color I'm going to change the background color to red and also I need to change the text style for this TT so I'm going to just give it a style and then I can change the text style first of all I will give it a color of white and that should be all right and it was good if I could change the color of this arrow button as well but that's not for me I cannot do it anything okay so for now it's going to be okay and let me also change this property of Center title and I will put it equal to true and it will make the title to go in a center okay so that should be all right now let's work on the body of it and the child of this padding is going to be just a column and inside the column what I want to actually create is first of all a text field at the top and inside that text field I can actually fill out the caption for this short video and at a publish button I can actually publish the video into the fire database so first of all let me just create this text field that's going to be the text field let me just change this properties I will give it a decoration and it's going to be the type input decoration here I can give it a hand text and I will give it something like write caption and I can actually give it a border as well so I'm going to just give it a border and of course is going to be the type outline input border here I will have a border side and I will use this class Border Side and here I can actually change the color to something like maybe blue let's see it looks like this and let me also give a padding to this column or maybe this text build I actually give that padding to this color so I can give it a padding from the left side like 10 and also from the right side 10 and and it should be all right so this is going to be the padding now I also want to create a button at the end for publishing the video so I'm going to just go after the text field I can create a flat button of course it's a PR fidget that I have inside the starting project the text is going to be just publish the onpress is going to be just empty for now but later on I will use it to actually publish the video and the color of it I can be using something like a color of green okay that should be all right and now let me just remove this cons and put it here here and that should be all right and it looks like this and I can actually change that and give it let me just go to the column and here I will change the cross access alignment to cross access alignment do stretch now it should solve it and also I want to give it spacer so after the text F I can just have a spacer and that should give it a distance from this two and I actually want to give a pading to this flat button and I will give it a padding from the bottom side a padding of 30 and that should be all right and now that everything is done I can actually publish the video and for ding it let me also create a controller so let's change this stess widget into a stateful widget and then I will create a controller called caption controller and of course is a type text editing controller and I will just take this caption controller and put it inside the text field so I will give it inside this controller and that should be all right and let me just remove this cons and it should be all right so now I'm ready to actually publish the video and first of all let me just get back to the short video screen and here whenever I navigate to that page as you can see here I also want to give it a video so I will say this video and it should be just equal to the video that I just exported so let me just come here and give it a parameter so I'm going to just say of course it should be a type of file and I'm going to just call it video video let me also UT a d. iio and I will generate Constructor for it now I have to initialize it and it should be the video should be equal to this video that we are getting again from the parameter and of course the type is the name of it is short video so I'm going to just write like this and it should be all right and I need to remove this cons and it should be all right now I can actually take this video so I have everything right now I have the DAT published I can just create one that did publish is of course just a current time so I'm going to just create a dead time and then it will be called dead and it will be equal to dead time. now so I have this caption I have the DAT time I have the video and I also have the user ID it's simple getting the user ID I can just get I can I can just take the current user ID so actually I have everything and I can actually publish the video right now and for doing it I can create a repository so I'm going to just create a new folder called repository and inside that I have only one file called short video repository here I can create a class called short video repository and just like always first of all I need to create uh some fields for Firebase fire and also Firebase OD so I'm going to just create Firebase alt and I'm going to just call it alt and the next one I'm going to just create one for the Firebase firer and of course I'm going to just call it fire store and then I can generate Constructor for it and now I'll be able to use this Al and also fire so add short video to fire restore this is going to be just the first method here and of course it's an Asing this method and then I can just use this file and then I'm going to just create a new collection called short yeah that's short and then I will have a dock and the dock here is going to be just uh I can create a comment uh a short video ID yeah that's all right actually however I actually don't need to do it because the way I will display the short videos later on is something that I don't even need this ID so I can actually just remove this Doc and I I don't need to even set the video I can actually just add and the data here so this is ADD let me just explain to you that this add is another method it's an alternative for setting the data but the difference here is that I don't actually need a doc I can just set the data and it will just give it some random ID but if I use set I can actually uh give it my uh my unique ID for each uh document but because I don't need actually uh unique document for each of this uh documents I'm going to just use this add method because later on when I uh you will see later on that whenever I get back the data when I display it into the UI I will just display them all inside the list with the Builder and I actually don't need any ID so I'm going to just use add and then here I can use uh an inance of short video model so let me just create it really fast I'm going to just say short video model as you already know I have created and I'm going to just call it short video and it will be equal to short video model now let me just initialize this values first of all is the caption the user ID short video and that published and I will just take all these values from the parameters so let me just create that inside the parameters the first one is and all of them are going to be just required string caption the next one is going to be just string user ID string short video this is going to be the actual video and the final one is going to be just dead time it's going to be called Dead published why we give any error here okay so now it should be all right and I have all this one let's see what's a problem here the short video is actually not a string but let me open this short video model and this short video should be a string actually and there should be no problem yeah it's actually because of the renames as you can see this short video is actually the same to the short video which I have named to this in ense of short video model so I can actually change it to just video and this should be just all right let me also give this a video now everything is okay I can put a comma here and then a semicolon to reformat the codee and now inside the ad I can just use short video and then just the two map as you already saw we have done it multiple times and I will just add all the data inside the firer collection and I will also change the return type of it to something like a future of void and it should be all right now I will get back to the short video Details page and right here I can just say actually first of all I need to create a provider for this just like always let me just remove this too and here I'm going to just create a provider I will name it short video provider and it's going to be just like always equal to simple provider and here I will return short video repository the art is going to be just F this fire fireb offense I will do the same for the fire as well and that should be all right okay now let's actually publish the video right here and for doing it I need to convert this stateful widget into a consumer stateful widget so let me just import this and then I will take this consumer I put it right here and also here now I will be able to use this riff and I'm going to just say riffat and then I will use short video provider and then I can use this method add short video to the fer and the caption here is going to be just the caption controller. text the user ID is going to be just actually let me remove this user ID I don't need to initialize this value here and then I will get back to the short video repository because I have the OD actually here I don't need to uh give it a parameter so I will remove this user ID I don't need to take this as parameter and here the user ID is going to be just. karing user. uid and that should be all right okay and the next one is the video which I can just give it the viget do video and actually it's a type of file not a string so let me just check that and actually I can take the path yeah I me just say widget. video dop because I just want to store the path of this video and then the date publish is going to be just something like that which is the DAT time now and you already know so now it should be all right let me just synchronize this method and also make this a wait now everything should be okay and we will be able to actually upload the short video so now that we have upload the short video I need somewhere to actually get back the short videos and display it into a UI and inside a page and for doing it I need to go to the content feature and right here I have comments long video and the next I will create a new folder called short video okay now inside this short video I can just create a folder called pages and the first file is going to be Just sh video page okay now I'm going to just import the material. dart and create an thisel called short video page just like always let's create this scaffold inside the body I'm going to just create a safe area the child is going to be just a padding and I will have only a padding from the right uh from the top side and it's going to be just a padding of 20 okay now the sh for this padding is going to be just a column or actually I don't need it this column and I'm going to just display the data inside the N stream Builder okay that should be all right now I actually want to display the the data and just like always I can do it using an stream Builder and here the stream is going to be just the Firebase fire restore let me just create an any sense of Firebase fire restor and then I'm going to just open the collection of shirts where I just store all the short videos and then I can just say snapshots because and here I don't need any condition I don't need anything I just want to get all the data back it means all the sh videos back and then inside the Builder I want to create first of all some conditions which uh I'm going to just say if the data is not equal to I mean if it don't have the data so I'm going to just say the snapshot. data is equal to null or for example if snapshot so here I'm going to just say if a snapshot. data is equal to n or a snapshot. has data is not true just like always I'm going to just return this error page and in the next one I'm going to just say if snapshot do connection set is equal to connection set. waiting which in this case I'm going to just return the loader and finally when I get back the data I just want to return a list view. Builder here the inside the item Builder I can actually once again create this one I'm going to put a semicolon right here and actually I get the data and displayed right here so to get the data I'm going to just say snapshot. data. docs and it will just give me all the documents back I'm going to just put exclamation mark right here and then I will store it inside a variable called short videos or short video Maps the next I'm going to just I want to take each of this short videos so I'm I can just uh take one of them so I'm going to just and actually you want to convert it into a short video model so I'm going to just say short uh video model this is going to be the data type the data type and then I'm going to name it short video and it will be equal to short video model. from map and the map here is going to be just short video maps and I will just take each of this indexes yeah and actually here I need to specify the data because I don't want it to be like this and I actually want the data so that should be all right let me just remove this so what I have done here is just like always I get all the docks here which is of course that the short videos and then I convert it into a short video model just like this and now finally I just want to return uh a short video tile which I need to create so I'm going to just do like this and later on I can just create that I'm going to just create a new folder called widgets and inside that I can create this short video tile just like always let me just import the material. create the St this wiget called short video tile and now I can actually import this and that should be all right and this short video to takes a short video model as parameter so I'm going to just create this short video model I'm going to just call it short video then I can generate Constructor for it and that should be all right now let me also give value to the short video which is going to be equal to short video okay now everything should be good and we can actually display the data let me just create this short video to and this short video to is going to be just each short video that you want to display it's just the actual video the title of the video and then the date publish that's all so let me just create it instead of this placeholder I can actually return a p padding and here I will have a padding from the top side and then the child is going to be just a column so now uh for actually displaying the video I need to convert into a stateful widget and then I need to initialize this video player and first of all let me in uh let me just create the configuration for using the video player package and first of all I need to import that let me just import the video player because we want to display a video and for creating the configuration for video player first of all I need to create a controller so I'm going to just call it short video controller and initially it will be it will not be equal to anything so then I need to also specify the data type which is going to be just video player controller and that should be all right of course it's not final then I need to create an init set because the initialization and configuration will be done inside this and set and I can just do like this the name of the controller is short video controller and that should be all right I just need to take this and instead of this thing I need to actually show the actual video and the actual video here is going to be just the short video which I take from the parameters let me just first of all use a widget short video and the actual sh video that should be all right and this is the actual video which want to display and now inside the column I can just say whenever the short video controller is initialized I just want to check if this is initialized let me also put an exclamation mark here and only in this case I just want to show the as the actual value so I'm going to just create an this aspect ratio the aspect ratio here is going to be just L1 to 16 and that should be all right and the child is going to be just the video player and the controller is going to be just short video controller okay so that should be all right right now if we if the data is initialized I want to display this but if it is not initialized I'm going to just return something like a size box okay so now it should be all right and then we also put a cons here actually I'm not going to do this inside here but I need to do it for the column okay it should be right here I'll put this and then like this and this should be actually right here now after displaying the video I also want to display the caption and also the DAT publish so let me just create a row and right here I can actually create a text and then uh here I'm going to display the caption so I can actually display the actual caption I don't need to give it a hard code and here I'm going to just use this uh widget. short video. caption and let me just change the text style here so I will change the style property here and the text style is going to be just the F size of 20 and also a f Way of Bolt so now it should be all right let me just give it a const and then after this text I also want to display the de publish so let me just give it one another text and here the de publish is going to be just short video and here just the de published and then that should be all right let me also just convert it into a string and just just one thing that remember for displaying the date published and for displaying dates inside this project I'm going to use a package called time ago so I have already installed it inside my ppml file let me just show it to you it's going to be just this package and using this I can actually display the dates very beautifully and you can also just install this and then you'll be able to do so I will just import this package and now right here I can use a class of this uh actually first of all I need to make this time ago as like this so I'm going to just say I will use this as time ago and then I will be able to use that time ago. format and here the DAT is going to be just like this let me just remove this because I should not use I should not convert into a string and right now it should be all right so now everything is actually done let me also to change the main access alignment inside this row and I will give it something like the space between and now everything should be okay now I have to do one last step and inside the list with. Builder I need to add the item count property and the value of it is going to be just equal to snapshot. data. dos. length and it's basically just the number of short videos that we have inside this collection now everything is perfect and let's check if it's working or not so I'm going to just run the emulator now let's sayest if it's working or not so I'm going to just click right here to create a short I will just choose this video and now I will be navigated to this page which allow me to actually edit this short video I can choose whichever part of this video that I want and this is the demo of the video and once I'm done with everything I can just click here done to export the video and once it's exported I will be navigated to this video Details page which inside I can actually uh write a caption to this video and once I click on this button it will be published to the fire database so let me just give it a caption and I will just write first short video and I will hit publish now this video should be published so let's go and check the Firebase console to see if it's working or not and this collection of shirts is being created or not so let's just check it on I'm going to just uh refresh this page so as you can see this new collection of shirts is being created and in this collection the first video and the first short video is just like this the caption is first short video this is a dead publish short video this is the actual video and also this is going to be the user ID which is starting with B4 EP and this is my current user and my channel so the video is uploaded successfully and I just need to show it in the UI and of course I have already created that uh sh video page as you can see this is going to be the page actually the name is short video page yeah this is the page and I just need to put this page somewhere so first of all let me just uh close all the unnecessary pages and now I'm going to just open the page list and in the second page instead of just this Center text to say sh I'm going to just put the actual page so the name of page is just short video page and I have to just import it and it should be all right now let's check it out let me just do a hard restart first so now in the second page it should be the all the short videos and as you can see this is going to be the short video this is the demo of the video and this is the title first short video and also this is the date published 4 minutes ago so everything is working perfectly fine and the last thing that I need to do here is first of all give a p to this dead publish and also the title and also I want to be able to open this video I want to be able to pause and also play this video whenever I click on it I should be able to play it so let's work on this first let me just open the short video tile and inside that I'm going to just give a padding to this row at the bottom I'm going to just drop it with the padding and I will just give it a padding only from the right side a padding of 10 and also from the left side again a padding of 10 so that should be all right and it should be good yeah this is great and let me also give it a padding from the top side I think it's also good and I will give it a padding of something like six and it should be great yeah and the final thing is to just be able to play this video so let me just come here so I'm going to just wrap this aspect ratio with a gure detector and on the on property I will create this logic that whenever I click on this if it's not playing it should play and if it's playing it should just pause so let me just use this short video controller do value and then I'm going to just say if it's uh playing actually I need to create this inside condition so I'm going to just say if this is the case let me just put an exclamation mark here and also an exclamation mark at the beginning and what does it really mean is that short video controller. value that is playing but it's not true it means if the video is not playing in this case only I want it to be played so I'm going to just say value. playay or actually I don't need to use the value and I'm going to just say play the video and else if it's not the case I wanted the video to be pause so I'm going to just say short video controller do pause okay this is done the only thing I did was that I'm saying that if the video is not playing it should play the video and in the else cases it means that if the video is not it means if the video is playing in this case pause the video now it should be great and if I come here and click on the short video it should start playing and when I click again it stops when I click again it start again so everything is working perfectly fine and we are done with the short videos now let's just work on the final feature for this project which is going to be the search feature and I also want to be able to and let users be able to search both video videos and also channels so this is going to be the last feature that I'm going to add in this project so let's create it real quick inside the features folder I'm going to create a new folder called search and here let me just find it actually I can create a new folder inside it and the first one is going to be for Pages the second one is going to be for the wigets and the final one is going to be just for the providers so first of all I want to work on the UI of the search screen so let me just create create a new file inside the pages folder called search screen and after I'm done with the UI I can just work on the functionality of actually searching videos and channels so let me just import material. Dart then I can create an status fidget call it search screen and just like always I'm going to just return a simple scaffold and inside the body once again safe area the child is going to be just a padding and I will give it a padding from the top side just like always a padding of 20 okay so I'm done now here and the CH of this padding is going to be just a column and I will create everything inside this column so first of all let me tell you how this page is going to look like actually I want to create a page and first of all inside this column I will create a row and inside that row I will have an icon button and just an arrow button then next I want to create a text field which inside users will be able to se for the both videos and users so just is going to be just a simple text field and the final one I'm going to just add a search button which whenever user clicks on them they will be able to search for the videos and channels and everything and of course after at the end of the column I want to show all the uh found items so let's just create them as I said first let's work on the UI so I'm going to just create it real quick as you already see in the video this is the page that I want to create so first of all let's have a row and inside the Row first of all I have this icon button the unpress is going to be just empty for now and the icon is going to be just an icon of Arrow so I have this Arrow back this is the icon that I use here and I will just use this to navigate it back to the previous pitch let's also put some cons here to remove this blue warnings and after this icon button I actually want to create a text field so I'm going to just create a text form field here and and first of all let's change the UI for this text form field so I'm going to give it a decoration and using the input decoration I will give it some Styles first of all the hand text I will just give it a hand text of something like search YouTube and I also want to give it a border so I'm going to just use the outline inut border class and in the Border site I can use this class to actually change the color of this body border of this text F so I'm going to just change the color to something like maybe blue okay that's all right now let me just put this class somewhere in my project so I'm going to just take the search screen and find this Pages list and for now I'm going to just put this as a first list because it it makes my life much easier to see the changes inside this page but later on when I'm done with this page I will put it as a third page after the long video and short video pages but for now it's going to be just okay and let me just to hard start that you can see the changes of this search screen and I'm going to also just remove on the all the an necessary pages so I don't need them I'm currently working on this search screen and as you can see this is the icon button and I also need to wrap this side this uh text from filled with a size box that actually I can see it so let me just wrap it to the size box and here I'm going to give it a height of something like 50 and also a weight of like 200 and this is the pitch I actually need to increase the width for this so I'm going to give it something like 200 2080 and that should be much better or 70 is I believe it's okay so this is what I got it now and I'm going to also decrease the height to 45 and I think it is better and that's all right I also want to give this a border radius for this text F and for now this uh UI for the text is going to be okay but at the end I'm going to change this a little bit but for now let's be okay and continue with this so here I'm going to just use a preu widget called custom bottom it is a preu widget which I have already created and of course if you have downloaded the starting project you have all of them so I now have to initialize some of the values like icon data on T and half color and everything the icon is going to be just something icon. search we have this from the flutter itself the on Tab is going to be just empty for now and Al the half color it will be equal to true so that's uh so this should be all right and I should be able to see the icon actually here and this is going to be the icon and I also want to wrap this with a size box to give it my favorite uh height and weight so let me just give it a height of 34 and also a weight of 65 I believe that is the correct weight let's just check it out so this is what I have created created so far and actually I want to increase the height and a little the width for this uh search button so I'm going to just increase the height to something like 39 and I hope this fits this and I believe this is beautiful and later on if I want I can actually change the UI for this pitch much more and improve the UI and the ux for this page but for now I'm going to just be okay and now let's create the uh search user tile widget because whenever I'm uh searching for users so I should be able to see some users and I need to create that uh widget so as you can see in the page this is the exact widget that I want to create right now so I'm going to create a new file called search user tile widget or search channel tile widget so I'm going to create this page first of all let me just import the material. dart and create an status fet I'm going to just call it search channel tile I'm going to just call it like this and then I can actually create this page so as you saw in the video this is the page that I want to create and we will have a circle aatar first of all we have a row I have a circle AAR and the next child is going to be just a column inside which I display the display name the usern name number of subscriptions and also I want to have a subscribe button which all user to subscribe the specified channel so let's just create it first of all I will have a row and inside the children first of all I want to have a circle Avatar and the circle of water has a radius of 40 or 45 and also I would give it a background color of gray and I also want to wrap this uh row with a padding because I need to have some paddings from different directions like from the top side and also from left and right s side maybe so first of all Let me give it a padding from the top sides and a padding of 10 so after the circle aat I want to have the next child to be a column and inside this column I actually want to create first of all a display name so let me just create a Tex and I'm going to just call it Ahmed amini this is my display name I also change a style for this and I'm going to just give it a f size of 17 and also a f way and the F way that I'm going to just use here uh I'm going to just use a Funway of w500 okay after the display name I need to create a username so let me just create one I'm going to just call it AD Sign Ahmed amini this is going to be my hardcoded username but later on I will actually give it the actual username that I have but for now let's work on the UI as I said so the text St here I'm going to just give it a color of blue gray and I also want to change the phone size to something like tur in I want to make it a smaller and after the username I want to create the number of subscription and it's going to be for now just no subscriptions and again I want to give it a color of let me just change the text style and I will give it a color of blue gray okay this should be all right and I'm not going to change the F size for now and at the end I just want to create a subscribe button so let me just create that one as well and it's going to be just a flat button as you can see the text here is going to be just subscribe the unpress is going to be just empty for now and the color is going to be just black I think it looks perfect okay this should be it and now I want to actually use this that I can see the UI for this one so let me just take this and inside the search screen uh right here outside of the row and inside the column I want to display it in inside for now I'm going to just show hard Cod it I don't need to use any stream Builder or list with Builder I'm going to just do like this and this is what I have created so far and I need to actually change it a little so let me just get back uh I want to make this circle aat is smaller and also I need to change the main AIS alignment for this row and the main AIS alignment is going to be just something like space let's use a space around or maybe I should give it a space m or that's not looking very nice so I'm going to just use a space between and right now I also want to give an spor at the end of this row that makes that brings this column to this right here so at the end of this column or I should say at the end of the row I want to have a spacer ret yeah so let me just create an spacer here and now it's like here and I also want to give a padding to this column I'm going to give it a padding from the left and also from the right side so I will just give it a padding from the right side a padding of something or maybe from the left side ping like 20 and that should be all right or let me give it something like 35 and or I believe it should be 45 so for now it's going to be guess okay and I love this so I also want to change the radius for this circle aor and I I just give it 40 and this should be perfect for this thing and also let me just change the uh pading I'm going to also give a padding to this Row from the left side and a padding of 10 and that should be perfect so now I have this I also want to change the UI for this subscribe button and I need to make uh make this subscribe button to have a little smaller height and also I will widen this button so I'm going to just need to to wrap this flat button with a size box I will change the height to like 40 and I also want to give it a v so let me just give it a v of something like 80 and that should be perfect or I should increase it to something like 130 or 20 is okay as well or maybe even 10 because that looks perfect and now I also want to give this a size box to this subscribe button from the top side and I need to create a size box here and I will give it a height of like eight from the top side so that should be okay so now I have this and the search tile user widget is perfect and that is the way I want to and again if I want to improve the UI for this I can do it later on but for now let's be done with the UI and let's work on the logic for so first of all let's create the providers and inside this search and providers I'm going to just create a new file called search providers and here I need to actually create two providers one for the videos and also the next one is going to be for the channels so I'm going to just create both of them so the first one I'm going to just create call it all channels provider and using this provider I just want to get and retrieve all the channels POS possible inside this project so it means all channels or all users and let's create this simple provider and now I want to get back all the channels and to get the channels it's really simple it's not a big deal I can just use the Firebase fire store I'm going to just do it manually myself I don't need to use any provider or anything right here I'm going to just create an inance of Firebase fire store then I'm going to go inside the collection of users then I'm going to just get back all the channel and users inside this project of course I need to make this in and await this method now I'm going to just store this inside a variable called users map and this should be all right now I want to take each of the users from this users map so I'm going to just say users map and of course it's an iterable and then I can get all the docs of course now it's a list of variables and then I can use a method called map and this map just give me back each of the user so I'm going to just call this user and now what I want to do here is to actually use the user model and here I'm going to use a method called first of all let me just import this here I can use a method called from map and using this from map I can take each of this users and then I want to convert them into a model of user model and Fin finally at the end I want to convert everything into a list so let me just explain what I have done here first of all I will put some comments here to refer my deod what actually I have done here is first of all I took uh I went into the collection of users and restored them all inside a variable called users map and then I took docs and using this docs it means all the channels or all the users and then I use the map method to take each of the user from this collection from this list and then I convert them into a user model because I need a user model and not a map and then I finally convert everything into a list the result is going to be just a list of user models and I'm going to just call it users so that should be all right and finally I want to return this users and it's going to be just the return of this provider I exactly want to do the same for a video so let me just take this and copy one more time I'm going to just call this one all videos provider and this time I want to go inside the collection of videos and get everything and I'm going to just call it videos map then I will take each of this videos map I will have the docs and I want to do a map method here I will call it videos and of course this is going to be a a list of video models now I want to take each of the video and here I'm going to just use the video model and here let me just just Chang this to video and also here I'm going to just return a list of videos so now I have two providers one for the videos and one for the channels and using these two providers I can take all the videos and all the channels right here now let's get back to the search screen and here I can display all of them using a list. builder so first of all let me just create an expanded widget and the child is going to be just a simple list view. Builder and let me just tell you how I'm going to do this here we have the item Builder and that should be all right and I also have an item count and actually the way I want to create this uh first of all I will convert this St vet into a St vet and then inside this that I can create a list and this list is going to just called found items and for now it's going to be just empty and this found items is basically all the items that I have found all the videos in channels and everything all of them are going to just be inside this found items list so now let's get back to the list with that Builder here the item count is going to be just found items do length because as much item that we have right there it will be the item count for this list with that Builder and right here I'm going to just display all of them but before that I need to create a meod to filter the list because actually I don't want to just display all the videos or all the users that I have in the project I just want to display all the videos or users that the user have searched let me just explain myself I just want to display the searched or a specified users and videos based on what users have searched so for example if they search ah all the videos and channels that have this specific keywords they will be appear into the page so not all of them and for filtering the list I need to create a method here and I'm going to just create after this variable and I will just call it filter uh list okay this method is going to be just a syn I believe and I will just need to create them first of all uh I need to change this stateful widget into a consumer stateful widget because I need to use the providers that I just created a moment ago let me just import this and take this consumer and I will put it right here and also right there now I can use this refi to connect between different providers that I have and here I want to just first of all get all the channels that I have so I'm going to just use this all channels provider so now first of all I'm going to just get all the channels and as you know the result of this provider is just all the channel or I can just say as the result is a list of user models and I can just call it users let me just import this and that should be all right let's see what's wrong here and I also need to await this so now I have the users but I as I said before I don't want to display all the users I just just want to display a specified users that user have searched the specified users not all of them so for doing it I can actually create a condition I'm going to just say users and then I will use a method called where and using this where I can actually create a condition to say this element each of them is going to be just a user and here I want to create a where it means which users do I want to display and I'm going to just say each of the user that has actually a display name so I'm going to just search the users based on their display name and I'm going to just say user. display name do to string do to lower case so I will get the display name of the user and then I'm going to just say if it contains what I want which is going to be just the keyword that the user has just searched and I need to do it using a parameter so I'm going to just say keyword selected and I will just create here and I'm going to just say string keyword selected I will just uh fill that as parameter so if the display name of the user I going to convert it to string and then to ler case and if it contains if it contains the keyword selected in this case only I want to convert that into a list and do that stuff so I'm going to just say in this case I'm going to just convert it into a list all the users that has this condition I'm going to convert all of them into a list and finally store it inside a variable called found channels this is going to be the found channels and I can actually do the same for the video as well so let me just copy it one more time and in this case I'm going to call it found videos and I'm going to just map or fear and I'm going to just go through each of the video here let me just rename this to video and everything I also need to actually return something here so this should be returned here and also here and everything should be okay right now so these are the found channels and also these are going to be the found videos and here inside this method not outside I want to create another list which I'm going to just call it result and again it's going to be just empty for now okay so now I have this result and what I want to do is to add all the found channels and videos inside this result so I can just say result and then I'm going to use add and also I have this at all and I'm going to just use at all because I want to add a list to this result and here I'm going to add all the found channels right here so if you don't know and if you happen to use this at all it's actually a method that you can add a list into another list so what I'm doing right now is I'm adding a list of found channels into the list of result and I can just do it using this add all and actually I can do the same for the videos so I'm going to just say result. add all and I'm going to just add all the videos right here and at the end I'm going to just use a set set and inside the set set first of all I will Shuffle this list of uh result so let me just use the shuffle method it's going to just uh randomize all the items inside this rist of results because I don't want to be I don't want it to be a specific or for example first of all videos channels I want it to be shuffled and at the end I'm going to just add everything inside the list of results into this list of found items so I can just say found item should be equal to result and using this everything inside the result will be inside the found items so right now this list that I just created uh at the beginning this list of found items it has all the videos and channels so I can display it into this list with that Builder that I have created and actually I want to create another list inside list with Builder and it's going to be just a list for the widget because this found items is containing models it's not containing widgets but I need to work with the widgets and not models so I'm going to just uh create this list and I can just call it found you know items yeah this is the name found items and of course it's going to be just once again empty for now and here what I can actually do so this list of found items is going to just contain all the wigets into that list and as you know I have this found items and if I use the index inside that it means that each of this uh which I'm going to just call this variable uh something like selected item and what I mean by item is that it's not uh specified whe whether it is a video or a channel that's why I'm going to call it selected item so now the selected item is whether a video or it can be maybe a channel so now the final part is going to be just I need to create some conditions to see if it's a video or if it's a user and if it was a video I'm going to add a post or a video into the list of found items and if it is a user I'm going to add that one uh the search user tile widget into this list and if you wonder how can I do it I can do it using the type fill that I have created inside both users and also videos and as you remember from the previous that I told I need I needed to create this type and if you wonder why I need it so I need this type to specify whether it's a video or a post and of and of course I have created this inside each model of video and also channel so now I can create some conditions to say if the selected item do type this selected item the type if it is equal to a video in this case I want to add that video into the list of found items but if else if the selected item. type is equal to user in this case I'm going to add that user inside that list and for now it has this type uh it gets some error and maybe I should not make it funnel let's see what's wrong here and now the errors are gone and actually I have some typo here I have renamed two lists the same this found items I have here and also I have this found items there so I need to change this actually I'm going to keep this widget data type but I need to rename this I'm not going to call this found items but I can just call it items widget it was just uh some renames that caused this error so I can just call it items wiget so now back to what I said if the selected item the type is equal to a video I want to add that video to the list and if it is uh user I want to add the search user tile widget that I just created now into this list of items widget and let's just do that and also I can create other you know conditions as well that if for example this list is empty what I should happen for example if the list of found items is empty and this case for example I just want to return a size box but for now first of all let's add the video and also the user to the list so first of all I'm going to make this condition that if the selected type if this selected item it's a video all you want to add a post or a video into that list so I can just say in this case the items widget list do I'm going to just say add and then what I'm going to add here is going to be just the post widget that I have created and here I just need to give it the video which in this case going to be just the selected item so now it should be all right whenever it's a video I'm going to just add this post which you know it's the thumbnail and everything of the my video to this list of items widget but if it is a user in this case the list of items widget I will add a search user tile widget search Channel tile so this is what I'm going to add if it is a video for now I can just give it a const okay so let me just explain what I have done here I have a list of items widget of course it's a data type is a widget so it contains widget inside this list the next I have created an index for this final items it means that this selected item is just every single item that I that has been searched it can be a video it can be a user and I have just created this recation that if this item is a video in this case I want to add that video to that list of items wiget but if it is a user in this case I want to add that user to the list of items widget and if it is empty I just want to return a sized box and finally when this all conditions are done I'm going to just return this items widget but at the index number zero so if you wonder why I do need to use this index number zero because it is exactly what I need to do here and every time the list V that Builder rebuild itself it gets a new index and at each time the index number zero which is going to be the first item will appear and when I do that you will see that it's completely working and it's correct so at the end I'm going to just return the first item of this items widget list and that should be perfect now let me just use this method of filter list somewhere and the best place for doing it I believe is going to be just a inside the unchanged property for the text field me just find this text fi here I have an unchanged property and if you wonder when this metod triggers every time that I release a key on the keyboard This whenever you type something inside this text fil or you release a key this unchanged method will be triggered so I believe this is the best place because whenever a new character or a new key is released I want this filter list to be triggered and change the items so let me just use this filter list method here and the keyword selected here is going to be just it can be the value yeah I don't need to use any controller and I'm going to just do it using this value that I have here so this filter list should be a future let me just specify this that the result of this method is going to be just a future of void because I'm not returning anything and also I want to this me make this method a and aoid this so now this should be all right and it should display everything let me just do a hot restart okay so right now if I search for example a as you can see it's working now I can see this this is going to be the first user and also this is going to be the second user and I hope it's perfectly okay actually it's not okay because I haven't give it the actual value inside the search tile widget so for now as you can see this is just a hard C it but it's not an actual value and I need to give it actual value so I need to create that and here I can give it actually a user model because this is what it needs and I'm going to just call it user now let me just generate Constructor here and now I just want to take this user and put it where it needs also I need to put some cons here to remove this blue warnings first of all I need to give it a background image the circle AER and of course I need to display the port picture of the user who is displaying here and for D get just like always I can use a cache Network image provider and here I can just say user. profile picture the next one is going to be just the display name so let me just remove this hardcoded text and then instead I'm going to use user. display name and put accounts here the next one is going to be for the username it's user dot actually username and accounts here the next one is going to be just the number of subscriptions and here I can just say user do subscriptions. T string for now it's going to be all right and everything should be okay now inside this search screen I need to give a value for this search tile um search channel tile and it wants a user which is going to be just the selected item here so I need to just give it the selected item because this is what it takes now let me just do a hard to start and it should be working so if I search here something like a maybe it gives me back yeah this is going to be the channel and also this is the second Channel but I don't know why it's giving me back the same channels it should not be doing like this so we got some errors here and let me just find out what's wrong here actually I had some errors here which I just need to solve right now and first of all is that I have created this provider all channels provider but I haven't used actually the provider for the videos and as you can see I have used here the users any set of videos and I need to do like this videos and now let me just create the provider for the videos as well I mean I have to use this provider as well so this is going to be just a list of video models and I'm going to just call it videos and here I can just use ratch and here I'm going to just use all videos provider and that should be all right and of course I'm going to just await this method as well now I have this videos and instead of working on the display name I need to work under the title in terms of channels I want to I want to search on its display name if the keyboard selected is inside the display name of this specific Channel but in terms of videos I want to check the title if the keyword selected is inside the title of this specific video and now this should be all right and one other mistake that I made inside the list F the Builder I don't need to use else if I just need to use if and again right here I only need to use if instead of lse if because that's going to give give us some error and now everything should be just okay let me just do a hot rest start and now if I search for example for a as you can see I get one channel called Ahmed amini and also I get this video first video on the platform for example if I add H you can see the video disappears but I still I can get this video so everything is working perfectly fine so now that we are completely done with a search feature and as you can see I can search any user in video for example I search ah and as you can see all the channels or videos related to the my search will appear on this list for example right now I'm getting this Channel ahmar amini and for example right now we have arol M and all these channels and also videos so the search feature is completely work working perfect but now I want to just go one step further and what I want to do is whenever I click on a channel for example this mik acman I want to be navigated to this profile so when I click on mikar acan I should go to the Mikasa AC's profile and as you know I have already created this user Channel page and up to now I only have the UI but now I want to give it the actual value first of all I need to convert this status widget into a stateful widget and then I can just create a user ID so I'm going to just create this string user ID and using this user ID I can get the actual user of that a specific channel so I'm going to just generate Constructor for it and also let me just put a cons here to remove this blue warning so right now everything is perfect and I can just use a provider called each user data provider which I already have created inside the out feature and of course you should be familiar with this and using this any user data provider I can get the data of the channel which I have clicked on so let me just uh come here and here I just want to create a consumer widget and I can just get all the data using that so let me just copy this uh column I'm going to take this whole column and cut that make sure to just cut this column and here I can just create a consumer widget here I have a builder and here I can just use this ri. watch and here the method I want to use is that any user data provider and of course here I need to have a user ID which I can just say widget. user ID and it is the user ID that we get from the parameter and here we have this when that it can of course you're just familiar with this uh we can handle different conditions whether we have the data whether we have the error or loading first of all if we got the actual data I just want to return everything that I have and the next of course if you got any error I just want to return the error page and if you got uh if the data is loading I just want to uh show the loader pitch so that's all right now let me just show the actual value because using this any user data provider result of this method is going to be a user of course type is user model if you wonder which user is this it's based on the user ID that we give and right now that I have this user ID I need to go to the search screen and what I want to do is whenever I click on a channel so let me just come to this search channel tile and I want to just wrap the whole thing with a G detector and into the onp property I just want to I just want to make sure that when someone click on this specific Channel they should be navigated to that profile so I'm going to just create a navigation here and here I'm going to just return this user Channel page and of course as you can see it takes and it wants a user ID and the user ID is going to be just this user. user ID the one that we are getting from the parameter so everything should be all right now let me just get back to this user Channel page and here I just need to fill out all the data so first of all I need to give it a background image of course it's going to be the perfect picture so I'm going to just use once again the cach network image just like we always use and the URL is going to be just this data I'm going to just call this user because it is any user that uh we have clicked on and the profile picture is going to be just user do profile P now let me just remove this const and that should be all right the next let me also fill out the display name and it's of course just user. display name and again remove the const and put it here the next one is going to be the username and again that's going to be just user do username and remove the and put it here so I'm going to just do that for all of them and for example the number of subscriptions and instead of this no subscriptions I want to give it the actual value of number of subscriptions here so what I can use here is it should be user actually let me just put it inside the string and here I'm going to just say the value of it is equal to user do subscriptions. length and I just need to remove this cons and this should be all right and right now we are just getting the user. subscriptions. L and here I'm going to just say subscriptions and of course I'm going to just do the same for the number of videos as well so let me just copy that and paste it here and in instead of subscriptions I'm going to just say videos but it does it doesn't need a link because number of videos is an integer inside my model it's not a list so that should be all right and also let me just have some distance here and that should be all right so right now we're done here and of course I don't want to have this Boolean as I said before this Boolean was just temporary because I didn't have the actual value I just created this but now that I have I don't need this bullion anymore and I can just use the actual value of the videos and actually I need a new whole provider to show the value so let me just uh go back to show that this Boolean for now this should be all right but later on I'm going to just change it before that I will show you how this channel this page is going to look like so that should be all right also let me just return this one so now it should be good and let me just check it to you whether it's working or not and if it was working I will work on the videos as well so now when I click on this rmen arlet for example when I click on it as you can see I navigated to this arm in arlet profile this is the display name this is the profile picture username number of subscription and also a number of videos so this should be videos let me just change it real quick this is going to be number of videos and of course it says that for now it has no video so I'm going to just change right now so it's working as you can see we get the data of this specific Channel but now let me just show the videos of this specific channel so how can we do that as I already told you uh I'm not going to use this uh Boolean because it was just temporarily but now I want to use the actual value to see if we have videos or we don't have any video actually I need to create a new provider as I already told you so let me just create that one as well and I can create this provider anywhere I want for example I can create that right here so I'm going to just say this is for the provider and here I'm going to just create channel provider so here let me just create this I'm going to just uh call this provider something like each Channel videos provider because I want to get all the videos of a specific Channel using this provider so this should be all right and of course I'm going to just use a simple provider just like always and let's see how we can just create that one here I need to go first of all inside the collection of videos but actually I remember I don't want to use this provid I actually need to use a future provider because for need to get the value I need to use the VIN method again and that should be the perfect provider and instead of a simple provider I can use the feuture provider or I also can use the stream provider but here the feuture provider is perfect so here I need to go inside the collection of videos because I want to get all the videos of a specific channel so I need to go inside the video collection so let me just go first of all uh Into the Fire firer inance so I just need to create an inance of this Firebase fire store and then I can go inside the collection of videos and then here I just want to create a condition to say if the user ID because as you know I have a field inside a video collection called user ID and then I'm going to say if the user ID inside that video is equal to the user ID that I want to take from the parameters so I need to add this user ID as parameter and here of course this feature provider is not going to be just a feature provider not a simple feature provider but I'm going to just use the keyword family and now that should be all right so now I'm going to just say uh I create an inance of Firebase fire then I go inside the collection of videos and where the user ID is equal to this user ID that I take from the parameter in this case I want to get everything from this collection so now I need to store this inside a variable called videos map and now I got all these videos and now what I want to do is to just convert this list of videos into user model into video model actually so I can just say videos map and then I can use a method called first of all I need to go inside the docks of course uh I need to make this aist because of course it's a future provider I need to make this iniz and now it should be working perfectly so now inside this video map I can go into the docs and now I have all the videos and I can just call it videos okay I'm going to just call this videos and then I can go into the videos and then do the map and map means I can get each of this video and then I want to convert them into a video model so I can just say video model and then I will use the from map and the map is going to be just a video. data and finally at the end I'm going to just convert everything into a list and here this is going to be a list of video model so let me just so when I convert everything into a list I get this videos back and here I need to call this one so I'm going to just say final list of video model and I can just call it video models and that should be all right so now I have this video models and I can just return this video models okay perfect now I have this video models and this videos are going to be the videos of a specific Channel because everything is in this condition that I have created because I'm saying only on only and only I want the videos which the user ID is equal to the user ID that I take from the parameter so now that I have created this provider I can actually just go back to this user Channel page and here I can actually show the videos of this specific user and for doing it as you can see in this pitch I already have this first consumer bdet and using this consumer Viet I just get the user data of this specific user but I need to actually create a second consumer vget so let me just take this first one I'm going to just uh take the first consumer widget and I will just take it out and first of all I want to have a column inside this column I can have this consumer widget and and also right here after the first consumer vet I want to create another one so let me just write a comment here to say second consumer viget and using the second consumer vidget I can actually show all the videos of this specific user that we are in in the channel right now so I'm going to just create this uh consumer vidget and it has a builder now I can actually use this riat and the provider here is going to be just each Channel videos provider and I have to just uh initialize this user ID here which is going to be widget. user ID and now I can actually use this win method and now I can have uh based on different scenarios I can actually handle the data when I have this data when I have an error or when the data is loading so you're already familiar with this stuff so it should not be hard for you if the data is loading I'm going to just return a loader just like always when we got an error I'm going to just return this error page and when we have the actual data in this case what I want to return is uh let me just show it to you I have this right here let me just take this padding up to right here I'm going to just delete the rest of it I don't need it for now and I can actually show this inside the data so this should be good let me just put a semicolon here and everything must be good let me just see where is this error actually I need to return this and now everything should be good so basically I just want to display all the videos inside the second consumer widget so inside uh this column I have two consumer vets let me just uh uh walk you through it so what we have done inside this file I have a column inside that I have two consumer widgets inside the first consumer widget I just want to display all the user data like profile picture display name and everything and inside the second consumer vget I want to display the videos of that specific channel that we are in and we are clicked inside it so this data is going to be just the videos all the videos inside this Channel and actually I can just display all of them using a grid view. Builder it's a prebuilt widget that we have inside the flut SDK and actually I don't need this no video uh and I can just take it out and instead of the that I can display it using a grid view. Builder so now inside this grid view. Builder we have to required parameters this grid delegate and also the item Builder the first parameter of grid delegate is just something uh related to the UI so this is going to be uh what I use here the cross AIS count of two the cross AIS spacing of it and also the main AIS spacing of it this is something uh related to the UI and also I have this item Builder here and inside item Builder I can actually display the videos using this uh provider that I have just created so let me just do that real quick and what I can do is actually say if I want to just create a condition here to say if the videos is not empty in this case I want to just return a post here and the video here is going to be just videos index so that should be the video all the videos inside this specific Channel let me just reformat The Code by putting some comment here and now I think I can actually run the project to see if it's working or not and here I also need uh the item count property which it just it just tells us how many videos do we have here and the and it's going to be just something like videos. link so that should be good and here uh it just needs to return something here and I've I've just said here that if the videos is not empty so if we have some videos here I just want to return this post and in other cases I'm going to just return a size box means nothing so now this should be good and let me just uh run the emulator and also the project to see how does it look like and if it's working or not and also before running the emulator let me also uh do something here I actually want to take a I want to wrap this gv. Builder I can wrap it with a size box and I will just give it a height of something like 80 I hope that is the perfect size for this great V do Builder and now I think everything should be good so let me just run the project good the project is run and let me just test it out if I search your ah it should bring all the searches and all the results here and when I click on the second one Ahmed amini so this is the videos of this user this is the data and also this is going to be the videos and it should be working fine and this should be good now let me also do something else here and inside the first consumer vet I want to display uh some text so let me just uh create them first that you can understand what I mean I want to create a condition here so I'm going to just say user. videos do is empty or I can just say if the user. videos is equal to zero it means that the user has no video in this case I can actually display a t to say no video this user doesn't have any video but if the user has any video I just want to display a text to say this specific user I want to have the display name of this user so I'm going to just say user do display name and I'm going to just say here videos so this should be good let me just put a cons here and I also want to wrap this text with a center widget and what actually I'm doing here is to have a condition to say if this specific Channel doesn't have any video I just want to display a text to say no video but if it has any videos all you want to say okay the videos of this specific user I just want to display them and in the second consumer vet I can actually show the videos but in this uh part I just want to say okay uh this is going to be the videos of this user and let me just take this and I need to display it after this flat button not before it so let me just put it after this flat button and now it should be good let me just check it out if it's looking good or not and as you can see this is the text that I have created it looks like this Ahmed Amin's videos it's good I just need to uh change the text style of this and also its position so first of all let me just change the styling of this text the text style here I'm going to just change the font size to something like 23 and also I will give it a font way of Bol and this should be good about the text style let me also change its position by giving it a padding so I will just wrap this text with a padding and I will give it a padding from the left side a padding of 10 and also from the top side a padding of like for in and I hope this looks good so it looks like this videos and these are going to be the videos and when I click actually on this videos it will be navigated to that a specific video so everything is perfectly working great and these are the videos and actually I just want to display the thumbnails not all this information inside that post like we also have have the display name we have the dead population we have a lot of things inside this post but I just want to see the thumbnails of this videos and when the user clicks on them they should be navigated to that specific video and I also uh let me just change the text sty for this one I will give it a style and again I want to give it the same text style that I have for this one so let me just copy this and paste it right there F size of 23 and also F we of Bolt that when we don't have any video it should display a text to the user that there's no video inside this channel so this channel has not uploaded any video and now it should be great so this part is great and now I can display the videos of other users other channels but I also want to display videos of my own channel so how can I do it let me just open that my channel and inside my channel screen I also want to display my videos let me just put some cont here where should I actually put this videos actually when I click on my profile right here so this is inside the account page and when I click right on my profile I want to be navigated to this my channel page so let me just create this one as well uh inside the account page when I click on my own profile which is going to be just this row I think this row contains all this stuff or it should be this column yeah uh I'm going to just wrap this column with with gesture detector and in the on property I'm going to just make this that whenever someone clicks on this profile this column they should be navigated to this my channel page so I'm going to just create a navigation here and I'm going to just return my channel screen so this should be good let me just put some commas here to reformat the code and now when I actually click on my profile I should be navigated to this my channel page and that is is great so this page is already made and I just want to display my videos inside this page as well uh let me just go into through this my channel page and where I actually uh where I can actually put my videos it should be inside this top pages and actually I can create a whole maybe a whole new page for that because for now as you can see we are only showing some pages uh some vide like text Home Videos short community playlist Channel about but I don't want to have this and basically instead of it I want to have some actual pages so instead of this uh home the first one I want to have an actual page to display my videos inside that and inside my channel the parts I can actually have or maybe inside the pages yeah here I can have home page I can say home Channel page let me just UT the material. dart create an inad this fidget and I'm going to just call it home Channel page so that should be all right and right here I'm going to just create an scaffold maybe it's necessary or maybe not maybe I remove it uh so let's see how it does it look like and inside the body I can actually show all the videos so I can just copy everything from the previous example inside the user Channel page I have a second consumer wiget and I am sure that I can use the second consumer fdet to display all my videos inside my channel as well let me just take this I'm going to just copy and paste it right here of course I'm going to need a lot of things here first of all let me just import this post the error page and also the loader and basically I can also import this one and this FL River pod actually what I really need here is a user ID and the user ID here is going to be just the current user ID so I can just create an incense of Firebase OD and then the current user and the U ID because the user ID of this one is going to be my own user ID because we are working on my own channel page and all the videos of this one is going to be all the videos when the user ID is my own user ID that I'm currently signed in with uh let me just see what is the error right now and let me just remove this and this should be good so now let's do a hard rest start and before that let me just put that page right here this home Channel page and let's see if it's working or not and actually as you know I don't have any video inside this uh account I haven't uploaded any video with this account so I can also make a condition here I just remembered I can make a condition that do we have any video inside this page or not if we have video we are going to just display the videos but if we don't have any video I can just display a text to say no video inside this collection I don't know if there is any way to do it actually of course it is we have this videos and I'm going to just create the condition right here to say if the videos. length is equal to zero this means that we don't have any video which in this case I'm going to just uh return a text to say no video but if it is not the case it means we have video and in that case I'm going to just display all the videos we have let me just wrap this one with a center widget and put a cons right here and also I'm going to just change the text style for this text and I'm going to just give it a font size of 23 and a f Way of both so let me just create that the font size is going to be 23 and the f Way is going to be just a f Way of Bol everything should be perfect now and as you can see I get this no video because we don't have any video inside this channel so I haven't uploaded any from this Channel and now everything should be good and we are able to see the videos of my own channel and also other users Channel now that we are almost at the end of this tutorial I want to just make the UI and also the ux in some of the pages look a little better so so I'm going to just uh work on the UI first of all let me open this account page and as you can see this is the UI for the account page and it's really not looking very nice so let me just change some of this stuff here first of all I can remove temporarily this icon button and also I can just take out this circle aor and put it inside this row this is the perfect place for the circle aatar and this is what we got up to now I also want to wrap this row with a padding so I will give it a padding from the left side a padding of 20 and also I uh I can give it a padding from the top side and this is what we get up to here and also I want to bring this username to the start of this column so I think I can just uh give this uh column a cross axis alignment and this should be a start that is good and and also after the username I want to have a text here so let me just have a text here to say manage your Google account and this one I wanted to change the text style so I will give it first of all a color of blue and maybe a f Way of w500 yeah this is what I got here now let me also change the username I just want to give it an add signed at the beginning this is the username let me just take this and I'm going to just do like this and here just before it I wanted to have an add sign now it looks like add sign text so whatever the username is I want it to be add signed that username so that should be good and now let me just give it a padding from this to bottom side as well to this row so I'm going to just give a padding to this row only from the bottom side and I will give it a padding of ter so I wanted to have a great distance here and this is what we get actually now let me also give a padding to this items as well and I will give it a padding of maybe 20 so I'm going to just wrap this items with a padding and I will give it a padding from the left side and it should be a padding of 20 this should be good and this is what we get and also after this items I also want to add another text that we actually have in YouTube so I'm going to just add a text to say privacy policy dot terms of services and let me also change the style for this text I will give it a color of blue gray a font size of 1.5 and also a way of w500 let me just put some cons here to remove this blue warnings and this should be good and actually this is what we got up to here and before that I just need to have a spacer and also I need to wrap this text with a padding to give it a padding from the bottom side and it should be pading of 12 that is great now this is what I got up to here I have this uh information at the top side then I have this items and then I have this text also let me just give it a distance between this profile picture and this information so let me just create a size box between these two after the circle aor I can have a size box with a weight of like maybe five and this is what we get up to now so this is going to be our account page and right now it looks much better than the previous one and also I can actually remove the font wave for for this manage your Google account text let me just remove this phone to and this should be better so this is going to be the final one and when I click on it I navigated to this my screen page and everything is great so now I also want to work and improve the UI of the search screen as well the screen that right now I'm in and basically I can just change this text field and make it more beautiful and fancy so let me just open this sech screen and right here let me find the text field so here I'm going to just uh make this text field look a little more beautiful and for doing it I can do a lot of stuff here first I just need to change the color to gray color with a shade of 200 let me just remove this const and everything should be good and also I want to add a border radius to this uh border so I'm going to add a border radius here a border radius from the all sides it should be circular and I will give it a border radius of 18 I want this uh text F to have border radius as well and now I can just copy everything from this border and I'm creating some more border like Focus border also enabled border so I'm going to just copy the to this ones as well and the fil property will be true because I want this text field to have color so this is going to be the color of this text field and also the content padding I want it to have some padding from the top side uh I mean from the left side a padding of Daring and also from the bottom side a padding of 12 so I want it to be the padding and also let me put some commas here to reformat the code and I also want to change the hand style for this text field so I'm going to just give it a text Style and here I can change the font size to like 4 in and also the font weight to w500 now this should be good let me see it right here and this is what we got up to now let me also change the width of this to something like uh 295 actually it's a lot so let me just give it something like 280 or maybe it should be 275 and and also basically I also want to change this uh icon at the end as well so let me just find that the search button I want it to have a BD of something like 50 I want it to be a little smaller actually something like 53 should be good and I also want to increase the height to 43 or I should make it 55 I think that looks good and I also want to change the height of the size box to something like 43 I want it to be a little smaller and now I want to change this WID to 279 and I think that looks great and I also want to change the color of this one as well so I will change the color of this Arrow back to something like gray with a shade of 600 or 700 and let me just remove this cons and everything should be good so this is the new UI of this text f and I think it looks much beautiful now about the UI and the user experience inside this project I want to give you a final homework for the entire project I just want you to fix all the remaining stuff inside different files and different pages for example inside my home Channel as you can see I have zero subscriptions and zero videos so I want to make this condition that whenever we have no subscription it should be like no subscription and when we got no videos it means it's zero videos we should have a text to say no video so something like that I want you to do all this stuff inside different files and pages and just fix all this box this small box and this is going to be your final homework inside different files and different pages I have some hardcoded dat publish as well so I haven't had uh the actual value so I want you to give them the actual value and also use the time ago package to create an accurate uh de publish for all them so this is going to be your final homework to just solve all this small box inside different files and different pages and now I'm going to just work on the last feature here and it's to have the subscription The View and also the like feature actually before that let me just work on one other feature and it's going to be the feature of first comment in every video so when I open a video in this box right here all you want to have the First Command displayed and for doing it I need to create this feature inside this uh as you can see here I have this commment box and right here I have this container and inside this container in the child property I want to create a consumer widget inside which I can just display the first comment in every video so I'm going to just create a consumer widget here and inside the Builder I can actually create this functionality and actually before that for displaying the comment and the first comment inside this video I need to have a comment provider so uh inside the content here inside the comment folder I can create uh a comment provider and inside this provider that I'm going to just create right now I will be able to get all the comments and later on I can display the first comment inside that box in the video so I'm going to just call this uh comments provider and it will be equal to just a simple provider and here I can do everything right here so here first of all I'm going to just create an inance of Firebase fire store and then I'm going to go inside the collection of comments and here which comments do I want to get I need to use this where method to get a specific comments because I just don't want to get all the comments inside this collection because there are a lot of comments I just want to get every comments in every single video so I just want to do this and for doing it I need to say I just want to get all the comments where the video ID is equal to the video ID which I'm going to just take as parameter here maybe I should not create a simple provider or I should have of course I need to have a future provider not a simple provider so I'm going to create this feature provider and it's not a simple feature provider it is a feature provider. family because I want to have a parameter here which is going to be the video ID and let me just explain to you once again that what I'm doing here I don't want to get all the comments I'm going inside the collection of comments and then I'm saying okay uh inside this collection I want to take all the comments where the video ID is equal to the this video ID that I have and of course I will initialize this video ID right inside the video file and finally I'm going to just get all this comments let me just make this method as this and also await this and right now I get the result of this should be something like comments map but actually I don't need map and I just want to convert them into a comment model so for doing it I can just take this comments map and then I go through all the docks inside this comment map and then I can use the map method which give me access to all comments every single comment inside this list and then I can con conver them into a comment model so I'm going to just say comment model. from map and the map here is going to be comment do data of course you should be familiar with this because we have done it a lot of times and finally I'm going to just convert everything back to a list and of course the result of this is going to be a list of comment models first of all let me just put some comments here to refactor the code and here I'm going to just specify that the result of this all of them are going to be a list of comment model which I can just call it comments and finally I just want to return this comments from this provider so this is going to be the provider I have this feature provider that family which returns a comments and of course it takes as a parameter this video ID now I can just get back to the video inside this consumer widget I can use the Riff to say riff doat and now I use this comments provider first let me just import it and I also need to initialize the parameter which is going to be the video ID I believe I can just say vget do video. video ID and now the result of this should be a list of video models but it's an async value so you should be already familiar that the result of this provider is not going to be just a simple list of comment moduls and it's going to be actually Asing value so I'm going to just say the result of this is going to be async value of a list of comment models and I can just call it comments and now I actually can use this comments to display the first comment here and here I'm going to just create a condition first and I will just say if the comments this is going to be a list is empty so uh yeah first of all I should say comments. value now I have the list and I'm going to just say if it is empty in this case I'm going to just return a simple size box let me just put an exclamation mark here and now it should be good but if it is not empty in this case I'm going to just return a vget that I have already created and it's called the video first comment in this case I'm going to just return this video first comment and it is a vet that I have already created inside the starting project you can access this widget let me just uh go inside it and here you can only see a column inside B I have two rows the first row says this text comment and also it has a number of comments that we have inside this video and in the second row I have a circle aor inside which I show the guy who just uh posted that comment and also I have the actual comment the actual first comment on that video so here I need to create a parameter and it's going to be a comment model because I want to display that first comment and I can just call it first comment actually I'm going to just call this first comment let me also import this comment model and also generate Constructor now I have to initialize it inside this video and it asks me for a first comment and this first comments is going to be just the comments in index number zero so this is going to be the first comment actually first of all once again I need to use this value and then I can get the first comment here now it should be good let me just get back to this video first comment and I have to just initialize this first comment here we have the numbers and here I can just say first comment actually maybe instead of this first comment I should just get the whole comments yeah I think that's a better idea because as you can see here I also want to display the number of comments that we have inside this video so for ding get I need to have the whole comments not only the first comments so let me just change it back to the comments and this should be actually a list of comments a list of comment models and instead of first comment I can have the comments and here I can just say I want to just uh initialize the whole comments not only the first comment and here I need to change it to comments now everything should be good and I'm going to just use this comments and here I can say comments. length is actually the number of comments that we have inside this video this is a hardc text and I don't have to change it uh the next I also want to display the profile picture of the guy who just posted that comment so for ding GE I actually just need a user model or I can just take the perect picture but I prefer to have the whole user model so I'm going to just say user model and I have this user let me just generate Constructor for it and I also want to have this the value of the user should be only this user this user that I have it right here so let me just initialize it I'm going to say the user will be equal to user I should say user. value and inside this video first comment I can just initialize this background image here and the background image which is going to be the profile picture for this guy is going to be once again let me just use this cached Network image provider and the URL is going to be just user. profile picture this should be good and now let me just initialize the most important thing here which is going to be the first comment and it is only the comments and I want to take the first comment here and I want to just specify that I want to take the common texture that should be all right now let me just do a hot rest start and check it out whether it's working or not now I'm going to just write a comment here first comment and hit send and here I have the first comment and right now when I get back I should see the first comment here as well and here we go we have this command displayed right here but it has some errors some bottom overflow so let me just fix this real quick and now the error is fixed and as you can see the first comment is displayed properly now I want to add the liking functionality as well and for doing it I'm going to just do it right here whenever the users click on this Thum up button they should be able to like this video and I can just do it right here inside this on the property and I'm going to just create this method called like video so let me just create this method uh in this state and I'm going to just create it right here it's going to be an a method and I have to create the actual method inside this video rep itory inside this video repository after now I have only one method called upload video to the firer and I also want to put this method to like video as well right here so I can just create this method which I'm going to just call like video again it's an asynchron method and I should be able to like video here so the algorithm I'm going to just create for liking video is going to be something like if my uid is inside the list of likes on that specific video in that case it means that I have already liked that video so in this case I'm going to just dislike it but if it is the opposite I'm going to just dislike that video so if it's not clear for you just make sure to follow along and you will understand what I mean uh first of all I need to have some parameters here inside this like video and the first one is going to be just a list of all the likes so I want to just have access to the people who has liked that specific video the next parameter is going to be the video ID so I want to have access that video ID of the video that you are trying to like and the next one should be so maybe that's enough let me just create it and later on we will understand so what actually I want to do is first of all create an instance of Firebase fire store and then I'm going to go inside the collection of videos and then the doc is going to be the video ID so I have this inside my parameter I'm going to go inside the collection of videos and then I'm going to go inside the document with this video ID and then I'm going to just update so what should I update here is going to be first of all let me create this I'm going to update a parameter called likes and this is a list actually and I want to update this uh fi likes so I need to use this field value and then I can use this array Union if you are not already familiar with this thing a reunion field value it's just something that I can use to modify and update the value of this field in this case it's a likes it is a list and I just want to update this field so I can just use this field value. AR Union and I'm going to just go through this list of likes and add my uid so I can also have the current user uid here and I'm going to just add the current user ID inside this list but when are we doing this we will be doing this whenever the video is not already liked by me so if I haven't liked that video I want to do this so let me create this condition first of all I'm going to just cut it and here I'm going to create a condition to say if likes do so this likes is going to be a list let me also specify this that this likes is going to be a list if likes. contains my uid which is going to be current user ID and I'm going to just put an exclamation mark here to say it should be the verse what does it mean is if my current ID is not inside this likes list in this case I want to like that video because it means that I haven't liked that video and I want to do it so I can just paste this one it means that I have to like that video but if that is the opposite so I can just copy once again here from this side not exclamation mark to say if I have already liked that video so the likes list contains my uid it means that I have already liked that video and in this case I just want to dislike that video so I can just copy this one here and I'm going to just change this array Union to array remove let me explain one second that what I have done inside this method I have three parameters the likes list it's a list of all the likes inside that video the next I have this video ID and also I have the current user ID what I'm seeing here is if my current user ID is not inside this list of likes it means that I haven't like that video and in this case I want to like it I want to insert my uid inside the list of likes and if it is the reverse it means that I have already liked that video I want to do the opposite and I just want to remove my uid from this list now I can actually use this method before that let me also specify that this like video is going to be a type of future and it doesn't return anything so it can be just void and also I have to make this method a synchronize and also await this and also this one now it should be good and I can just use this and I can do it using this long video provider so let me just get back to this video and right here I can use a RI to say I want to watch this provider let me just import it and then I can use this like video I need to provide this uh three parameters here the likes and also video ID and current user U ID and also let me just just to be safe let me make these three parameters required because they should be required and I'm going to just put some required before them uh it's not that much necessary but just to be safe it's better choice now I can get back to this video and I have to initialize them the first one is going to be the current user ID and it can be just the U ID of my current user and I can just uh find it using this Firebase .n. current user. uid the next one is going to be the list of likes and I have again access to this uh let me just see it so this is the video and I can just have access to it using video. likes first of all let me just use this widget. video. likes and the next one is going to be the video ID and it can be again viget video. video ID so now it should be good just let me make this method a wait now it should work and before testing it out I also want to bring some changes when I like the video in default this button thumb up color is equal to black but whenever we like the video it should change to Blue so let me also create this functionality as well and it's really easy I can just give it a color and here the color is going to be based on a condition I'm going to just say uh if this widget. video. likes it means this list of likes contains my current user view IDE this fire . instance. Curren user uid if it contains that let me see what's wrong here so if this list of likes contains my current user uid it means that I have liked that video and in this case I want the color of this button to be blue but if it is not true I just wanted to have a color of black now it should be good and also I want to display the number of likes right here so I need to create a text here to say I want to display how many likes this uh video has so for doing it I can just create something like this and here I'm going to just say widget. video. likes. length I just want to display how many likes this video has so now everything should be perfect and let me just run the project to see if it's working or not so now let's check it out when I click on this like button and right now after I do a hot rest start as you can see the video is being liked now let me also put a size box here between these two so I'm going to go inside this video and then let me find the th up and right here I can just add a size box it will have a weight of like five and right now as you can see it looks much beautiful there is only one point about liking this video here and it is that it's not real time I did not use any stream for liking the video and as you saw I needed a hot restart to see the changes so here I'm going to give you another homework try to use a stream provider and make the changes in real time and that's not really hard so I'm going to give you a hint that how can you do it you can just create an stream provider and get all the data of videos using that stream provider and then use that value in the like uh section so you will be able to see all the changes in real time so now first of all let me put all the pages together and for doing it I'm going to just open this Pages list and here the first pitch here should be this long video screen after that I want this short video screen right after this long video and the next one is going to be search screen upload so search screen should be after this upload and the final page is going to be the logout page so now this should be good and we're good to go the next feature that I want to create is actually the view feat Fe so whenever the user clicks on a post and they are navigated to the video screen and they are just watching a video the views for that specific video should be incremented by one and the best place for creating this view functionality is going to be right inside this post that whenever the user clicks on a thumbnail and they are navigated to this video right after the navigation I want to increment the views of that video and for doing it I can just create an incense of Firebase fire ster and I'm going to going to go inside the collection of videos into the document of video ID so let me just find what is the video ID here I should have it as a parameter yeah I can just say video. video ID and then I'm going to just update one field here and it's going to be the field of views so I'm going to just say the field of views let me just uh like this that you can see the code properly so what I did I just went into the collection of videos the document of video ID so I want to just uh increment the views of this specific video I'm just updating it and I just want to make it this field so I'm going to just say field value you already know using this I can go inside this field and I want to increment and I'm going to just increment a number of one so just doing this I can actually increment the views filled inside this video by one and this should be good now the last feature that I also want to add inside this project is going to be the Subscribe Feature so whenever the user clicks subscribe on a specific Channel they should be able to subscribe that channel and I'm going to just create this function right inside the channel uh folder the users Channel and here I have a provider called Channel provider so I believe I can just create another provider for this and actually I need a provider or maybe I need a repository so I'm going to just create a new file called subscribe repository and here actually first of all let me create a class I'm going to just call this subscribe and here I can have first of all an innocense of Firebase firer just like what we did always and I think maybe I don't need an innocense of Firebase all so that should be it and now actually I want to generate Constructor for this that should be good so here I'm going to just create a method called subscribe Channel and a this method and here the way that you want to subscribe channels is exactly like we like the videos so they exactly the same we have likes list in the video model and also I have a subscribe subscriptions list inside the user model or the channel model so they're going to be the way of uh doing them is going to be really the same and there's no difference and just like the previous one I need to have three required parameters here the first one is going to be the user ID so this user ID is the user of the channel who we are trying to subscribe the next one is going to be the current user ID I mean the user of myself that I'm trying to subscribe a channel and also I may need the subscriptions list so I want to know all the people who have subscribed that channel so I need a subscriptions list as well here so now uh the way I'm doing it is again creating some conditions to say if the uh first of all let me specify that the subscriptions is a list I'm going to just say that if this list of subscriptions contains my user id the current user ID this means that I have already subscribed that a specific channel so for doing it I need to remove my subscription so let me just create an instance of Firebase firer I can just use this firer and then I'm going to go inside a collection of users the doc should be so I'm trying to remove my subscription from that specific channel so the doc here should be the user ID and I just want to update a field here which is going to be the field of subscription and here I'm going to just say fi value and I want to remove my subscription from this list so I'm going to just say remove the current user ID from here so that should be good I just need to do like this so what I said here is that if the list of subscriptions contains my user ID so this means that I have already subscribe this Channel and for doing it I just want to remove my subscriptions my user ID from this field of subscriptions so this was the first condition and the second one is going to be like this it's going to be exactly uh the reverse of this one I can say if the subscriptions let me copy this one and I just need to add an exclamation mark at the beginning to just reverse everything here I'm going to just say if the current user ID if my ID is not inside the list of sub subscriptions in this case I want to add it so I going to just copy this but I just need to change this AR remove to array Union I want to add my ID inside this collection so now everything should be okay let me just make this method a wait and also I will do this for this one so this should be good let me just correct this one and now I can actually use this subscribe Channel method and also I want to specify that this is a feature of void and so let me see where should I use actually this subscribe Channel method the first place that I'm going to use it is inside the video so let me open this video and find this uh subscribe flat button it should be uh here let me just find it real quick so here is the first place that actually I want to use it and actually here I want to subscribe user and I will have a comment here to say subscribe you Channel and also a just forgot to add a provider here so let me just find the subscribed repository and here I also want to add a provider here so I'm going to just call it subscribe Channel provider and it's going to be a simple provider and here I'm going to just return this subscribe and also I need to require this I need to make this required and now I have to initialize this fire ster which is going to be the Firebase firer do any sense so now I have this let me just use this provider inside video I'm going to go inside this video and here I can actually use this so I'm going to say riat this provider and I'm going to just subscribe the channel here I need to initialize some values the user ID the user ID here is going to be just uh let me just find it first of all I'm going to just put a comma here and also a s column okay I have a video that is one of the things I have and also I have this any user data provider which I get a user from this so I have everything here and the user ID is going to be just user. user ID I should have this uh value. user ID and this should be good the next I need the current user ID and it's really simple I can just get it using Firebase fire ster actually Firebase all I need to create an of firebase. instance docar user. uid and the next one is going to be the list of subscriptions and again easy I can just say widget. video. subscriptions actually again I need the user so I'm going to just say user. value. subscriptions so this should be okay and now I have actually all the values here and let me just make this meod a and await this and now I should be able to actually uh subscribe all the channels and one other Placer I also want to add this uh method here is going to be just I'm going to just copy this inside the search screen here is also one of the places that I can actually subscribe user inside this search channel tile so I also have I also should have uh a subscribe button here as you can see I have it and here I'm going to just I'm going to just paste this in here okay so I'm going to just convert this stess widget into a consumer vidget first and I need to add the viget dri here this should be good and I'm going to just import this I also need to import one let me see here first let me import this Firebase off and now this should be good the only thing I need here is going to be the value of user because I don't have the value of user here so let me see actually I have this yeah this is going to be the user so I have this I just need to remove this value I don't need to have it so now we are done here and it should be working and we should be able to subscribe channels so that was it and I hope you got the most out of this tutorial and now you can try building similar projects on your own to examine all the stuff you have learned here so bye and good luck
