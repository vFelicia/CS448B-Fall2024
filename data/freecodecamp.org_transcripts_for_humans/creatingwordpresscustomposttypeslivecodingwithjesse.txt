00:04 - hey everybody its Jessie and today I
00:11 - haven't even done anything yet and I
00:13 - already have one thumbs down on this
00:17 - video so I'm not mad about it
00:22 - I just wonder what what did I do I don't
00:25 - have a thumbs down it was already there
00:27 - like ten minutes ago so if you do
00:33 - dislike one of my videos let me know why
00:37 - I don't even care if you mean about it
00:40 - only cry a little bit but let me know
00:44 - why and if you don't want to call me out
00:46 - like in front of other people because
00:47 - you're afraid you know you people get
00:51 - mad about it or whatever just direct
00:53 - message me I won't call you out a few
00:55 - direct message me and are critical or
00:58 - whatever because I want to make this
01:01 - stream better so I really really
01:05 - appreciate all the positive feedback
01:06 - that I get and lately I've been getting
01:09 - a lot of positive feedback I've had some
01:12 - direct messages on Twitter and emails
01:14 - and you all been you know just really
01:17 - awesome and encouraging and I really
01:20 - appreciate that
01:22 - but if you don't like what I'm doing I
01:26 - you know if you have you know two
01:29 - minutes to explain why that would really
01:31 - help me out alright so I want to do two
01:39 - things today
01:41 - one thing obviously is make these custom
01:43 - post types like like the title of this
01:46 - the stream says the other thing though
01:49 - is I want to show you an error that I
01:52 - inadvertently caused when I set up the
01:55 - load balancer and that Sebastian caught
01:58 - so hey so Sebastian he's often in the
02:03 - live chat I don't even remember the last
02:07 - time he missed a live chat but last
02:10 - night Sebastian
02:12 - direct message me on Twitter and sent me
02:14 - a screenshot of some errors that he was
02:16 - seeing and I had not seen these errors
02:18 - before and once I did a little bit of
02:22 - research I found out what the problem is
02:25 - and so I think this is a problem that
02:29 - would be easy to have if you're doing
02:31 - load balancing I mean I've been working
02:33 - with next for a while now probably at
02:37 - least six months I've been working with
02:39 - next maybe longer what month is it
02:42 - yeah probably about six months and I've
02:45 - read through a lot of their
02:46 - documentation and I never saw this
02:47 - before so what's happening is this let
02:51 - me show you it's not gonna show up now I
02:57 - might have to show you on the yeah it's
03:01 - not going to show up here it'll show up
03:04 - on the server so let me bring in my oops
03:08 - actually I could have done it here yep
03:11 - let me bring this in and I'll go to one
03:15 - of these servers and let me let me
03:19 - change the color real quick because I
03:21 - know I had some I think it's there we go
03:27 - if you're using item and you press
03:29 - command I it will bring this up and you
03:31 - can change your colors but I just I
03:34 - haven't figured out how to get it to
03:35 - persist and change everything at once I
03:38 - haven't really taken that much time to
03:39 - try to figure it out the colors there we
03:41 - go maybe a week or two ago I had
03:47 - somebody that said that this black
03:49 - background was was just killing their
03:51 - eyes so I want to lighten it up a bit
03:54 - and so basically I'm going to go into
04:00 - one of the servers if you haven't seen
04:02 - the other videos where I set up load
04:05 - balancing right now this this site which
04:11 - I'll show you here in a second so this
04:14 - site that we've been working on for a
04:16 - while I'm doing this for anybody who's
04:18 - new is a react site and it's running
04:23 - next j/s which basically lets you
04:26 - scaffold your react app and it provides
04:29 - server-side rendering and routing right
04:31 - off the bat so it does a lot of cool
04:33 - stuff for you so you don't have to worry
04:35 - about that and you can just get started
04:37 - in you'll get to working on your app and
04:40 - I guess I had it right here too I didn't
04:42 - have to bring that one over so once I
04:47 - split it on to two different droplets on
04:50 - digitalocean so there's two instances of
04:53 - this app running and then I set up a
04:56 - load balancer I kind of use easy mode I
04:59 - set up the digitalocean load balancer
05:01 - it's like 20 bucks a month and it makes
05:04 - it really easy to do load balancing so
05:06 - at some point I would love to do like a
05:08 - live stream of setting up a load
05:10 - balancer maybe like from scratch and but
05:13 - for now that was a good first step for
05:16 - me into the world of load balancing but
05:21 - what happened that I didn't expect was
05:24 - this I should go so I'm going to open up
05:37 - this file okay so when you build your
05:41 - next app so when you run you know npm
05:45 - run build or yarn build or whatever you
05:48 - want to run it
05:49 - I think it's next build so however you
05:52 - run it it creates a unique ID well you
05:57 - need to build ID so my my deployment
06:02 - process for this is that I develop
06:05 - locally I push all the changes to a
06:07 - github repo and then I log on to the
06:09 - server I pull down the changes from
06:12 - github I build and then I start the app
06:17 - so on the server on one server there's
06:21 - one build ID and then you switch to the
06:23 - other one this is the other one not
06:25 - logged in right now with Logan the other
06:27 - one I have another build ID so there are
06:29 - two different IDs so then what would
06:31 - happen is I would I would come in here
06:36 - and I would click around and react would
06:39 - detect that the build ID was not the
06:42 - idea that it expected so this error
06:44 - wouldn't happen all the time
06:45 - it would only happen from what I could
06:49 - tell from what I read I think it was
06:52 - happening because sometimes part of the
06:56 - site was loading from one server and
06:58 - part from another server so like you
07:01 - know not every page has to load every
07:03 - resource right so you might get you know
07:08 - one request would get sent to one server
07:13 - one droplet and then a request you make
07:15 - a little bit later when you go to a
07:16 - different page might get sent to another
07:18 - one that's what seemed like was
07:20 - happening and then next detected like
07:23 - hey there's there's a difference in
07:24 - these I build ID numbers and it was
07:28 - giving me lots of errors okay so I
07:31 - wonder if I can show I'd like to show
07:36 - you what the errors look like in case
07:37 - you get them so you know let me let me
07:40 - look here at the screenshot that
07:43 - Sebastian sent
07:50 - let me bring this over
07:52 - it's kind of small try to zoom in okay
07:56 - so I can make this bigger so these are
08:04 - the areas that I was getting see invalid
08:07 - build ID basically there were actually
08:10 - two forms of this error there was it was
08:12 - displaying sometimes like this and
08:14 - sometimes it was displaying another way
08:16 - but basically both both times it was
08:19 - saying something about a build build err
08:21 - built idea okay so now we've got rid of
08:25 - those and here's how I fixed it so I was
08:30 - a little bit proud of myself when I
08:32 - thought about this so I didn't come up
08:33 - with it completely on my own I found I
08:36 - found this issue so somebody had had a
08:42 - similar issue and they reported it here
08:45 - in the github repo for next and then
08:49 - after some possible solutions and
08:52 - suggestions down here at some point
08:55 - I may be right around here okay so
08:59 - here's the suggestion to use a different
09:04 - build ID so make manually add a build ID
09:08 - that's the same ok the solution number
09:12 - one was well just build once and then
09:15 - copy that over and run that on two
09:17 - different servers but that's not that
09:20 - wasn't going to work with my deploy
09:21 - process so I didn't want to change my
09:23 - deployment process I want to find a
09:25 - different solution so the solution was
09:27 - just add something in add a step in to
09:30 - your build process that changes that ID
09:32 - to whatever you want it to be and make
09:34 - sure it's the same so the suggestion
09:38 - somewhere in the documentation for next
09:41 - it also suggested you could use the ID
09:46 - for the commit for the latest commit the
09:50 - - - like the head to the master branch
09:54 - and github I thought that's really cool
09:56 - so that's exactly what I did
10:00 - so check out my package.json here and
10:05 - here's what I added just this part so in
10:09 - the build process now I had this so this
10:16 - command get Rev parse head just gives
10:19 - you the ID and I know some of you
10:23 - probably know all this and this is old
10:26 - news for you but for there's a lot of
10:28 - people who are just starting out who
10:29 - might not be confident in their
10:31 - command-line skills so I'm going to just
10:34 - kind of explain what this does so I'm
10:35 - going to copy this come in in here and
10:37 - if you see this it just returns the ID
10:41 - of the latest commit so that's what we
10:47 - want we want this kind of unique ID but
10:50 - we want it to be different for each
10:51 - build but the same on both on both
10:56 - servers okay
10:58 - and then we're just automatically
11:00 - putting this into this file so if you're
11:03 - not familiar with this basically you
11:05 - know you put the sign in here what is
11:07 - this the greater than sign and then we
11:10 - specify the file and so whatever this
11:13 - returns becomes the contents of this
11:17 - file so it worked
11:23 - I now have those errors are gone the
11:27 - build IDs are now the same so anyway I
11:31 - thought that was a I mean it was a
11:35 - tricky problem for me when I first saw
11:36 - that last night I thought what is going
11:38 - on I have no idea you know what this is
11:41 - but not too bad after a little search so
11:46 - anyway I definitely wanted to point that
11:48 - out because I feel like if anybody had
11:50 - been following what I did with load
11:52 - balancing they probably got a similar
11:54 - error if they were using next as well
11:56 - and I didn't want to leave leave anyone
11:58 - hanging without you know bringing that
12:02 - up and explaining what I did so I mean
12:05 - this is all on github now you could
12:07 - check it out you know and add this to
12:09 - your project if you need to if you're
12:11 - having this
12:11 - error I'm going to check the live chat
12:14 - really quickly because I have some some
12:17 - comments in here before we get into the
12:20 - custom post types
12:21 - oh man Martin says two hours way too
12:26 - much it's a very good topic I liked the
12:28 - video before WordPress API but really
12:30 - two hours is way too much um yeah I kind
12:34 - of agree with you I don't I don't know
12:37 - let me know do you all like when I have
12:40 - the long streams like two hours or do
12:42 - you like it when I used to have a half
12:44 - hour streams so when I first started
12:47 - streaming I tried to set a half hour
12:49 - limit so I would code for like 25
12:52 - minutes and then I would answer
12:53 - questions for five minutes and then I'd
12:55 - be done because I thought the same way
12:58 - like hey nobody is going to watch the
12:59 - recording of a two hour video but a half
13:02 - hours more doable so let me know what
13:05 - you think it's just some of the more
13:07 - like detailed things that I had to do
13:10 - the more complicated things there is no
13:11 - way I could get it done in 25 minutes so
13:13 - I just kind of kept going so that we
13:15 - could do the whole thing I didn't want
13:18 - to break it up and have you know one
13:20 - thing take like three or four days so
13:23 - let me know I can definitely change it
13:26 - up if if you all think it should be
13:28 - shorter fine otherwise they'll kind of
13:30 - keep it going now I am I am doing I
13:33 - would kind of like to cut it back so
13:34 - it's more like an hour not not the two
13:36 - hours because that is a lot and I found
13:41 - like honestly like after I I'm talking
13:45 - for two hours uh my voice starts to go
13:49 - so I think if I did that every day I
13:51 - would lose my voice by the end of the
13:53 - week so I mean it's not the end of the
13:58 - world if my throat hurts a little bit
14:00 - from this but I think would be better if
14:03 - I still had a voice by the end of the
14:05 - week all right a lot of people saying hi
14:10 - hey everybody thanks for watching okay
14:14 - you you get not sure how to pronounce
14:19 - that I hope I pronounced it right you
14:21 - can says please start the technology
14:23 - from scratch that would help begin
14:25 - increase up their level that everyone up
14:28 - the level that would help everyone
14:29 - thanks you rock awesome thank thank you
14:32 - for the for the positive feedback there
14:34 - I really would like to start from
14:37 - scratch and I probably will end up
14:38 - starting from scratch soon when I move
14:40 - to my next project so this stream in
14:44 - particular is just what I have to do at
14:47 - work anyway I try to pick the most
14:50 - interesting thing that I'm going to do
14:52 - each day and save it for this livestream
14:55 - time and I get a lot of them more boring
14:58 - like copy and paste type of things out
15:01 - of the way early on in the day so
15:06 - sometimes we're doing more complex stuff
15:09 - and sometimes we'll be doing beginner
15:11 - stuff it's just it depends on what I
15:13 - have to work on that day but I know I've
15:17 - been saying this in promising this for a
15:18 - while but I am going to do some tutorial
15:21 - videos that will be pre-recorded and in
15:22 - those videos I will go over basic stuff
15:25 - and they'll be really targeted if
15:29 - someone will be targeted just that
15:31 - people who are really at the beginning
15:32 - stages so that is coming I have some
15:37 - outlines already ready for those videos
15:39 - I just need some quiet time to do the
15:42 - videos I've started to do one and then
15:45 - all my kids came home and it was just
15:48 - way too noisy and I don't have an office
15:51 - at home I need I need like to make a
15:54 - little office space where I could do
15:55 - this so anyway let me
16:01 - okay so Jordan says 30 to 60 minutes ok
16:06 - that's reasonable that's kind of the
16:08 - range that I think is probably best for
16:11 - me
16:12 - Rowan says I actually love these two 2.5
16:15 - hours stream but some topics can
16:18 - certainly be half or one hour ok cool
16:21 - yeah I do I kind of agree with that it
16:24 - it does depend on what we're doing as to
16:27 - the length
16:33 - see best to make sure topics are covered
16:36 - completely but an hour max good okay so
16:38 - an hour max an hour one and a half hours
16:42 - break it up
16:43 - okay so it seems like right around the
16:46 - one hour range seems to be kind of like
16:49 - the median of what people are saying so
16:52 - I'm going to try to keep things like an
16:55 - hour or less I will say a lot of the
16:59 - time at the end does come like we kind
17:02 - of get into a discussion about things so
17:04 - the actual coding time sometimes isn't
17:07 - that much but maybe maybe we can break
17:12 - it up maybe there can actually be a
17:14 - scheduled like question and answer time
17:17 - so that we can split up and have videos
17:20 - that are just coding and then videos
17:22 - that are more Q&A I don't know I have to
17:25 - think about that and see you know when
17:27 - that would be good to do I do I do like
17:32 - the idea Jordan says break it up into
17:34 - different streams multiple streams per
17:37 - day so like instead of making one long
17:40 - stream that's two hours I could do for
17:42 - half-hour streams so yeah that would be
17:46 - a little bit more work just to set all
17:48 - this times up and to make like video
17:50 - thumbnails for that but I guess I could
17:53 - use the same thumbnail and just change
17:55 - part 1 part 2 part 3 so that's that's a
17:59 - good idea I'll think about that one as
18:00 - well sometimes I don't know ahead of
18:02 - time how long a certain thing will take
18:05 - Roland says spontaneous Q&A is better
18:07 - yeah that's what I was thinking the
18:11 - scheduled Q&A might not work out the you
18:15 - know if we do get questions they just
18:17 - kind of flow out of what we're doing
18:20 - [Music]
18:23 - Danny says we be doing WordPress
18:25 - development stream yeah so I'm doing I'm
18:28 - going to do that right now
18:30 - sometimes I I'm not going to do a
18:32 - dedicated stream for WordPress like
18:35 - every you know every so often but every
18:37 - day but occasionally I will need to do
18:38 - WordPress stuff because I work with
18:40 - WordPress websites sometimes so we'll be
18:44 - incorporating that
18:45 - so let me get to it it's already been
18:49 - I'm talking here about you know cutting
18:53 - down my stream time and I've already
18:55 - spent the first almost 20 minutes on you
18:58 - know kind of beside the topic I mean now
19:01 - we haven't it was important we were
19:03 - trying to break down and troubleshoot an
19:05 - error so you know that was valuable but
19:10 - I do want to get to it okay somebody's
19:13 - joining an expecting wordpress I don't
19:15 - want to be disappointed so here I have
19:19 - let me move this over and just to show
19:25 - you how we're going to do some of these
19:27 - so I already have some custom post types
19:30 - running and I'm going to bring over my
19:32 - wordpress site as well to show you what
19:37 - post types I have running and what it
19:42 - kind of looks like here so I don't know
19:45 - how familiar you all are with WordPress
19:47 - it's a content management system that's
19:49 - built on PHP and normally the way you
19:54 - use WordPress is you have a theme and
19:56 - that's you know rendered it's you know
19:59 - PHP templates and it's all tied in here
20:03 - with this admin panel and that's how
20:06 - normal WordPress website works you know
20:08 - normally like you know you click a link
20:10 - it's a page refresh and everything
20:12 - everything's rendered on the server
20:13 - using PHP what I'm using WordPress is
20:17 - I'm using the API so all the content
20:19 - still goes in here and basically it's
20:25 - still running PHP behind the scenes but
20:27 - I don't use PHP to render anything okay
20:30 - there the display portion of it what
20:33 - people see with what the client sees you
20:36 - know for instance this is built with
20:39 - react and it lives on a different server
20:42 - than this so when this page loads a
20:46 - request is sent to WordPress saying I
20:51 - want to certain data and then it comes
20:55 - back in JSON format
20:58 - and then I handle on this end sorting it
21:03 - out and rendering it all so WordPress
21:06 - now is in I think the term people use is
21:10 - headless so we're using it as a headless
21:13 - CMS so WordPress isn't usually a
21:15 - headless CMS but we're using it in that
21:17 - way here is that all we care about is
21:20 - content going in here and we don't care
21:23 - about display here we do all the display
21:26 - stuff here so that's just a quick
21:30 - overview in case you're wondering what
21:32 - you know how WordPress ties in with with
21:35 - react and what we're doing I will I'm
21:41 - not going to go into a lot of the why of
21:43 - doing it like this because I've covered
21:44 - it before in videos and in the comments
21:47 - to some of the videos early on but just
21:53 - to to say a little I've found that when
21:57 - I make sites like this they are much
21:59 - faster than traditional WordPress sites
22:03 - that I've done and I'm able to do
22:06 - different things like yesterday we set
22:08 - up it's not live yet but yesterday we
22:11 - set up a like a live search that just
22:14 - automatically gave us search results and
22:16 - it was really cool
22:17 - not that you that's not possible with a
22:19 - normal WordPress site but this gives me
22:24 - a lot of freedom to use the build tools
22:26 - that I want and be able to do everything
22:30 - in JavaScript you know using react
22:32 - instead of having to do a lot of the
22:34 - templating in PHP and now if someone was
22:37 - really good with PHP maybe they'd like
22:39 - to do in a different way but I'm not
22:40 - great with PHP but I know enough to do
22:42 - custom post types so let me show you
22:44 - that what a custom post type is in case
22:48 - you're not case you're not sure so this
22:52 - is one custom post type it's called
22:54 - nearby events so this isn't default in
22:56 - WordPress I just made this name up
22:58 - nearby events will go to add one okay
23:02 - and I've also added some custom fields
23:05 - and we'll probably add some of these
23:07 - today I did not code these custom fields
23:10 - in PHP
23:11 - so what we'll do is I'll show you how to
23:13 - code in PHP the custom post types but
23:17 - then I'll show you the plug-in I use as
23:19 - well to do all these fields for me since
23:22 - I'm not really a PHP guy the custom post
23:26 - types are pretty easy to do but all the
23:29 - custom fields were just it was just too
23:31 - much work for me it made more sense to
23:34 - go with a plug-in and also if you're not
23:38 - familiar with WordPress plugins will
23:40 - cover it you know in a little while so
23:42 - it'll make more sense but basically I
23:46 - can just set out here's what I want
23:48 - here's all the fields that I want this
23:50 - gets put in here and then the data I get
23:53 - the data basically like this this isn't
23:57 - the same this is data for different
23:59 - custom post type but it gives you the
24:01 - same idea is that this is how I get the
24:03 - data that gets put into here and then I
24:07 - can do whatever I want with this in
24:08 - react okay does that make sense
24:11 - I'll check the live stream if this is
24:13 - like completely confusing to you let me
24:17 - know in the live chat and I can let me
24:21 - know what's confusing and I can't
24:22 - explain it otherwise I'm going to keep
24:24 - keep going and show you how how we set
24:28 - up these post types so there's probably
24:31 - a little delay so I'm going to wait just
24:33 - you know a few more seconds here to see
24:36 - if anybody has a question at this point
24:38 - because if you lost at this point I'd
24:41 - rather like try to catch you up a little
24:43 - bit then then you stay lost let's see
25:02 - okay rowan says you you just request
25:05 - content on api's probably as may be
25:07 - overkill though but better than learning
25:09 - a new CMS she was funny
25:15 - I'm not sure if that was in response was
25:19 - that in response to Danny or what also
25:22 - yeah it probably is overkill but in this
25:29 - particular case I didn't just need to
25:32 - make a site I need to make a site that
25:33 - was very impressive is there because of
25:36 - the circumstances surrounding why I got
25:38 - this project and everything I needed to
25:40 - make it in a very impressive sight that
25:44 - did more than a normal site would so
25:47 - that's part of the reason why I went
25:49 - with this as opposed to just a normal
25:52 - WordPress site there are some other
25:54 - really good reasons why and I think I
25:56 - went over those a previous video so I'll
25:58 - not go over them again here but if you
26:02 - are thinking like like Rohan that maybe
26:04 - this is overkill for just a normal
26:07 - website I I don't completely disagree
26:09 - with that but if you can make something
26:14 - better and you have the time to do it
26:16 - and the ability well you know why not do
26:19 - it alright so I'm going to continue I
26:25 - didn't have anybody say ok so that Rowan
26:27 - said that wasn't response to Danny so
26:29 - that's what I thought I just wanted to
26:30 - Claire this clarification
26:39 - okay Jake says overkill maybe it depends
26:43 - on whether or not you're doing edits are
26:45 - passing the site off the clients yeah
26:48 - okay Jake I'm glad that you are I'm glad
26:51 - you said that Jordan also mentions
26:53 - building custom CMS is a lot of work
26:55 - definitely a lot of work and Jake says
26:59 - WordPress really easy to understand for
27:01 - non techie people good I'm glad that
27:04 - that you both brought up those points
27:05 - because this this is exactly why I chose
27:10 - WordPress as the CMS because it's so
27:13 - easy for non tech people to use I'm not
27:17 - going to be maintaining this site in
27:18 - terms of content which is great I don't
27:21 - I don't ever want to maintain content on
27:23 - a site I just want to build new sites
27:25 - and make them better so other people so
27:29 - grad students who are getting their
27:32 - degree here I work at the University who
27:35 - are getting their you know their
27:37 - master's degree here and are trying to
27:40 - make a little bit extra money you know
27:41 - while they're in school so I can pay
27:43 - their rent and everything they're going
27:45 - to be up updating the content so the
27:48 - people updating this are constantly
27:50 - going to change it's probably going to
27:51 - be a new person every year every two
27:52 - years they may or may not have any
27:54 - experience okay so they're not getting
27:56 - their degree in anything computer
27:58 - related so they need something that's as
28:03 - simple as possible so the idea is I make
28:08 - pretty much everything that makes sense
28:13 - edit able through WordPress and then I
28:17 - make some tutorial videos so that the
28:21 - new person would just be able to watch
28:22 - you know a playlist of tutorials and
28:25 - they would be able to go in here and
28:26 - make any edits so I'm trying to make it
28:29 - as easy as possible and make kind of
28:30 - restrictions so I have restrictions on
28:33 - some post types like if you upload an
28:35 - image that's you know a certain size if
28:38 - it's not at least let's say 600 pixels
28:40 - wide then it won't display because I
28:43 - don't want pixelated looking images on
28:44 - the site so even if somebody were to
28:46 - upload you know a really small image
28:48 - because they don't realize you know the
28:51 - quality of images
28:53 - and how that works on websites then
28:55 - there's some protection that that won't
28:57 - make the site look bad
28:58 - okay so some of the fields don't allow
29:02 - HTML strips it out so there's some
29:04 - protections in there like that so
29:05 - setting it up like this definitely makes
29:09 - it easier for people to enter content
29:11 - and then it also gives me a lot of
29:13 - control over how that contents displayed
29:15 - and it takes that control away from the
29:17 - WordPress editor which in this case we
29:20 - want because it would be very easy for
29:23 - someone who didn't didn't really know
29:26 - anything about websites to kind of make
29:28 - it look make it look bad I mean not that
29:32 - they would mean to but it would be easy
29:34 - you know if they could just go in and
29:35 - put a bunch HTML and change the theme
29:38 - and everything like you normally could
29:39 - do on a wordpress site that wouldn't be
29:41 - great so
29:52 - let's see there's some questions I'm
29:55 - going to come back to the questions in
29:56 - the live chat so I see there's some
29:58 - discussion going on there but I want to
29:59 - get to this I'll come back at the end
30:01 - and kind of join in the discussion a bit
30:05 - let me show you now now that we've seen
30:08 - the custom photo types what it's going
30:09 - to look like I'm going to show you how
30:12 - we make them I know I've briefly went
30:15 - through this maybe last week at some
30:17 - point I just kind of showed it now we're
30:18 - actually going to make some things with
30:20 - this and then we're going to add the
30:22 - fields to it and then we're going to see
30:23 - what it looks like when it comes in the
30:26 - API so right here I've just been making
30:28 - a list I've been going through the site
30:30 - and making a list of all the sections
30:31 - that right now you can't edit through
30:35 - WordPress that need to be added I have
30:39 - two ideas for how to do this some of the
30:41 - sections would probably work well if I
30:44 - just make them a page because if it's a
30:47 - section that won't be repeated so for
30:51 - instance like this section here is going
30:58 - to be an intro section I always want
31:01 - this section to just be about a
31:04 - paragraph okay so I can make this
31:06 - section just be a page and not even
31:10 - necessarily a custom post type it would
31:12 - just be a page with the name resources
31:14 - intro okay we could give it that name
31:17 - and then I could pull that page based on
31:19 - the the slug which is and I kind of like
31:23 - a string version of an ID WordPress
31:26 - gives every page and post an ID that's a
31:28 - number but then they also give it a slug
31:31 - which is always a string that is a
31:34 - unique identifier so in this case I
31:38 - would search for this name of this page
31:41 - okay so I'm going to do that I'm not
31:43 - going to do the pages that right now
31:45 - because I don't have to custom code
31:47 - those so that's not as nice a thing to
31:50 - do on on the video but for sections
31:53 - they're going to repeat so like
31:59 - in is it events now sorry courses
32:03 - okay so courses some of these sections
32:06 - will be static pretty much and so we
32:09 - could just make them a page but some of
32:10 - them like these are basically the same
32:12 - thing repeated over and over again right
32:15 - so it's just just text I did have a
32:18 - request to add some images in here but
32:22 - I'm not 100% sure how I'm going to
32:24 - change how this looks to fit with that
32:26 - so so that's that's coming but for now
32:32 - at least these are all just going to be
32:34 - repetitive sections so that's perfect
32:37 - candidate for a custom post site so that
32:39 - we can set okay I you know use we just
32:44 - need a title and then we need text just
32:48 - very simple now some of these like have
32:51 - a little bit of more custom formatting
32:53 - like this has you know this quote here
32:55 - so there are going to be some that if
32:58 - somebody knows what they're doing they
33:00 - could throw some HTML in here and it
33:02 - could work I'll have to make sure that I
33:04 - have the style set properly on on this
33:07 - end for it to work but you know that's
33:10 - so I want to leave this whatever we make
33:15 - as the input for this we want to make it
33:17 - so that hTML is able to be put in so
33:20 - we'll make that like a WYSIWYG editor so
33:23 - I think this is a good candidate to do
33:25 - first so let's do that and I've already
33:28 - had it to the list I think I'm just
33:29 - going to call it ministry tracks so I
33:34 - see I know there's some stuff going on
33:37 - in the live chat so I will get to it
33:40 - I just want to kind of push ahead with
33:42 - us now so that I can try to keep to keep
33:46 - this to about an hour
33:48 - total for the live stream so what I'm
33:52 - going to do basically this makes a new
33:56 - custom post type this this portion here
33:59 - is basically thing that you need to
34:01 - change there's one portion at the bottom
34:03 - which basically initializes everything
34:05 - okay so this you only need to add one
34:10 - time this section down here
34:12 - I'm just going to move down so we're
34:14 - very clear that this is a new section
34:16 - and these are custom taxonomies I'm not
34:18 - going to do custom taxonomies today I
34:19 - don't think I need these for anything on
34:22 - the site at this point so as long as you
34:26 - add this one time at the bottom here to
34:28 - admit everything you can just put you
34:31 - know all of your post types in one big
34:37 - one big object I guess that's what I'm
34:43 - not sure what this isn't PHP is okay so
34:45 - one big function so this is greater
34:47 - create new type function so yeah all
34:53 - right so it all has to go in that
34:55 - function sorry I'm just like trying to
35:00 - make sure that I know what's going on in
35:05 - the PHP and can explain it as best I can
35:07 - I am NOT a PHP developer so if you know
35:14 - more about PHP than I do which is likely
35:16 - just bear with me here I know enough PHP
35:21 - to make things change in WordPress and
35:25 - upload files on a small website that's
35:29 - about it so I'm going to take this I
35:33 - just copied this and I'm going to paste
35:35 - it below and I'm going to do some
35:44 - kind of best editing here so you see
35:48 - basically in this point I'll go through
35:50 - them all oops I don't wanna so some of
35:54 - these are going to be singular in some
35:57 - plural so what I found is it's easiest
36:01 - to just select the singular and then the
36:06 - S on the end will come in so if you
36:09 - shoot I don't have this in a repo maybe
36:12 - I'll make like a gist or something and
36:15 - make this available in case you want to
36:18 - add this to WordPress and make your own
36:20 - post type so I'll make a note of that
36:23 - right now and make that available if you
36:28 - want because I imagine you'd be super
36:30 - hard to try to like look at this on the
36:32 - video and type it all out as I'm moving
36:34 - it around okay I may already have this
36:41 - somewhere and get up and just to
36:42 - forgotten about it but in case I don't
36:44 - know add it and then I'll add a link in
36:46 - this video so basically at this point
36:48 - I'm just going to type in the name that
36:50 - I want for this ministry tracks whoops
36:58 - okay so now I'll go through this so
37:02 - we're giving it the official name right
37:04 - ministry tracks these names up here
37:08 - these are going to be the ones that what
37:11 - you usually see displayed in the admin
37:13 - panel that's why I like you know this
37:15 - this looks like normal text okay it's
37:18 - not you know we're not doing like camel
37:21 - casing or anything like that because we
37:25 - want this to display you know in a
37:28 - manner that's intelligible to people who
37:30 - don't know anything about code in the
37:32 - admin side so this is the singular name
37:36 - and this is let me bring this over here
37:38 - so I can it also be easier if I give you
37:40 - like a side by side to show you what
37:42 - these mean okay so the name - I need to
37:49 - get this big enough
37:52 - there we go all right so your name is
37:57 - going to display here right your ad new
38:02 - all right it's gonna see like ad new
38:04 - whatever you want to say here so you
38:06 - could change this if you wanted you
38:08 - don't have to keep the defaults all
38:10 - right when you go to you know edit the
38:12 - item do this see you get the idea of all
38:16 - these are going to show up somewhere in
38:18 - the admin panel now down here these are
38:26 - going to be the names that like you'll
38:29 - use when you make a request to the API
38:31 - or if you are going to do other things
38:32 - like make another PHP plug-in to do
38:35 - something else or even if you're making
38:37 - a traditional WordPress site and you're
38:39 - going to render these in PHP templates
38:41 - and things these are what you'll use to
38:45 - reference that so we just need to change
38:53 - ministry and do I do I don't remember if
39:01 - I usually do
39:04 - hyphens or underscores or camelcase
39:08 - let's see what I did here okay I did a -
39:11 - great I'm not sure what's the convention
39:18 - in PHP is it usually underscores or said
39:22 - hyphens I see some underscores here at
39:24 - this point it's I've already done it
39:27 - differently so I don't really want to
39:28 - change it because then I'll have to
39:30 - change code in other places but just
39:33 - though this may not be the conventional
39:36 - way to do it in PHP just in terms of
39:40 - style so this is actually you know this
39:45 - is registering the post type we were
39:49 - giving it the options here okay so these
39:52 - options some of these it just depends on
39:53 - what you want to do so you might not
39:55 - need all of these but they're pretty
40:00 - some of them are pretty like self
40:02 - explanatory other ones so you might want
40:03 - to check out
40:04 - the documentation there's so much
40:06 - documentation for WordPress stuff so
40:08 - you'll be able to find exactly how to do
40:11 - this you know has archived true right
40:16 - this this means is this post type going
40:18 - to have that archive function if you see
40:20 - like on a lot of blogs you can go back
40:22 - the archive to like you know go back to
40:25 - the post from October 2016 right so do
40:27 - we want it to do that yes we want to do
40:30 - that I don't really know if I'll use
40:31 - that function but in case I do I'm just
40:35 - adding that is this public okay so you
40:38 - can have post types that aren't meant to
40:39 - be public they just you know you're
40:42 - tracking data in the admin panel you
40:44 - don't want people to see it you got to
40:46 - be logged in and stuff so we want this
40:49 - to be public and then we say supports
40:51 - and these are going to be the fields in
40:53 - here so I have actually taken these out
41:00 - for this post type but normally let me
41:03 - show you a post so by default this is
41:08 - kind of the fields that you have I
41:09 - actually added some up here but by
41:11 - default you'd have write your title so
41:14 - that's what this is talking about you
41:16 - have your editor here you have and
41:20 - decide I may have disabled excerpt so
41:24 - excerpt is just a smaller text input
41:28 - area where you could put in a custom
41:30 - excerpt for your post otherwise I think
41:35 - usually it's set to just take like the
41:37 - first so many characters and use that if
41:39 - you don't set it and then the the
41:41 - thumbnail so you can set you can add or
41:48 - take away these you know whatever you
41:49 - want it to have I think some of these
41:53 - have are probably like mandatory like I
41:56 - think every post has to have a title so
42:00 - you may not be able to take all of this
42:02 - out but you can certainly you know add
42:04 - things and but I have a kind of an
42:08 - easier way to add and take away things
42:10 - so I usually don't mess with this part
42:12 - in the PHP exclude from search false
42:17 - capability type so this is the type of
42:19 - supposed so we're going to rewrite the
42:24 - slug right so to ministry tracks and
42:30 - we're going to this is the important
42:33 - thing for the rest api do we want this
42:36 - to show up and be accessible from the
42:37 - rest api yes and do we want this to show
42:41 - in the menu yes I'm pretty sure that I
42:45 - it's been a long time since I mess with
42:47 - this to check it but I'm pretty sure
42:49 - this is like show in the in the admin
42:52 - menu so like here in the menu so yes we
42:57 - obviously want it to be here so that's
43:00 - that's it that's all it takes to do a
43:03 - custom post type so I'm going to save
43:06 - this unfortunately I am not able to get
43:11 - into the server right now
43:13 - so I was hoping that I could just kind
43:16 - of edit this like not that this would be
43:19 - a great idea but I was going to kind of
43:21 - just cowboy code this and edit it live
43:23 - since it's like it's really basic
43:26 - there's very little chance of me
43:27 - breaking anything since its it's just a
43:30 - really repetitive task copy and paste so
43:32 - normally you wouldn't want to edit
43:34 - things live but in any case I'm actually
43:38 - going to have to copy and paste this and
43:39 - then add this in so if you've never
43:42 - added a plug-in to WordPress kind of the
43:45 - the weird way to do it is I actually go
43:49 - into the plugins section and I find my
43:54 - plug-in which is here and you can edit
43:56 - it now I think you have to be an
43:58 - administrator so not every user can do
44:00 - this which is a good thing so all those
44:02 - people who I talked about that are going
44:03 - to be editing this then won't be able to
44:05 - do this so if you're making WordPress
44:08 - site for client definitely block stuff
44:09 - like this out for them so they can't
44:12 - come in and mess with these because they
44:14 - can definitely break your site so I'm
44:17 - just going to paste in everything that
44:18 - we did which this like I can't stand
44:21 - like having to copy and paste stuff when
44:23 - I'm working on a thing but Moe whoa
44:31 - we will check here and look now we have
44:38 - ministry tracks so if we go here we can
44:42 - add a ministry track right now I haven't
44:45 - set any of the stuff that we need I may
44:49 - not actually have to set anything custom
44:52 - here because we if you see the site what
45:00 - do we need here we need a title and we
45:02 - just need content here that's all we
45:04 - need for right now at some point later
45:05 - on we might need to add an image
45:07 - somewhere but by default this comes with
45:11 - a featured image so we can just use that
45:13 - but for right now I don't want there to
45:16 - be an excerpt and I don't want some of
45:19 - these other fields to show that that
45:21 - don't really make any sense in a
45:25 - headless CMS so there's going to be a
45:28 - field like if I were to put something
45:30 - here and save it there'd be a field to
45:31 - preview and it would show like what the
45:34 - URL is going to be I don't want that
45:36 - because if you click it it's not going
45:38 - to show this site it's going to show
45:40 - what it would look like if we're
45:42 - actually using a wordpress thing usually
45:45 - I don't even have a theme I I just block
45:47 - everything so if you try to go click
45:49 - that it will show you a blank page
45:51 - occasionally I have it redirect to the
45:54 - Rick Astley video for fun but but not on
45:58 - a important site not on client side so
46:03 - all right before I show you how to add
46:07 - custom fields and take them away I'm
46:09 - just going to check the live chat
46:10 - briefly just to make sure you that you
46:12 - all are with me let me scroll a little
46:17 - bit see what I've missed
46:31 - a few questions only answer a couple of
46:33 - them while I'm while I'm here there's
46:35 - not a lot and Ray I'm not sure I'm
46:41 - pronouncing that right it's a nd REI let
46:43 - me know how to pronounce that and I will
46:45 - make sure I pronounce it correctly it
46:48 - says why why would someone pay a
46:50 - developer to code on my website when he
46:52 - can make his own with WordPress that's a
46:54 - good point to be honest with you for
46:58 - some people in businesses it does make
47:01 - more sense for them to try to just do
47:03 - some type of simple site with WordPress
47:05 - or with you know there are there other
47:07 - things like what is it Squarespace or
47:09 - there are a lot of different services
47:12 - where you can go and just kind of drag
47:14 - and drop build a website honestly if
47:18 - you're just going to do a personal blog
47:19 - and you're not really making money off
47:21 - it then no don't pay a developer and I
47:24 - mean I'm I'm a developer so I mean I
47:26 - want I want people to pay me to make
47:28 - sites but realistically it doesn't make
47:30 - sense if you're very like a small
47:32 - business and you need something very
47:34 - simple let's say you're you're from an
47:38 - area where like for instance the area
47:40 - where I live is predominantly elderly so
47:44 - the population demographics here just
47:47 - like really really skewed in favor of
47:50 - people over 60 it's just the economy is
47:53 - really bad where I live so most of the
47:56 - people when they graduate from high
47:58 - school they leave because they can't
47:59 - find a job here so that's how it is so
48:03 - when I talk to people like a small local
48:07 - business and they want to know about a
48:09 - website
48:10 - my advice is sometimes you know you
48:14 - don't want me to do a website for you
48:16 - because you're not really going to make
48:17 - that money back that much you know your
48:20 - clients aren't your clients aren't going
48:23 - to be using your website that much if
48:25 - you have a presence on you know Google
48:28 - Maps that's what you need so I'm not Lee
48:32 - talking about really small clients they
48:34 - don't have a lot of money so I mean
48:35 - obviously bigger companies should have a
48:38 - website it should be a good website it
48:40 - should not just be you know regular
48:43 - defaults
48:43 - they should have somebody it's a
48:45 - professional working on it so that said
48:50 - for this site in particular it needed to
48:56 - be better I think I mentioned it earlier
48:58 - so this site needed to be more than just
49:01 - a normal WordPress site so that's why I
49:05 - did it like this
49:06 - and there's some other you know good
49:11 - answers as well that other people added
49:13 - to that uniqueness is one I mean yeah
49:16 - the if you have a unique site that's
49:21 - well done it definitely just adds at
49:24 - least in my mind if I go to somebody's
49:26 - site a company site if it's just basic
49:29 - WordPress site I don't think badly of
49:31 - them but if I go somewhere and they have
49:33 - a site that's like wow how did they do
49:35 - this site you know and I want to inspect
49:37 - the code and see this is really cool for
49:42 - me like it's just impressive I'm
49:45 - impressed with a company that takes the
49:47 - puts the thought into a site and has put
49:49 - the resources into doing something like
49:51 - that so not everybody's probably like
49:54 - that but it makes a big impact on me you
49:59 - know your site I mean consider your
50:01 - website like the online home of your
50:04 - business the online location so for some
50:09 - companies they could do with just a
50:10 - generic looking you know building to do
50:14 - their business in right but for some
50:16 - businesses they want to stand out they
50:18 - want to have nice architecture nice
50:20 - decorations right that that's kind of
50:22 - the difference is between you know I
50:25 - just have a little shop that looks like
50:27 - all the other little shops on the street
50:29 - or I have a place that people look at
50:32 - under like wow you know they walk in and
50:34 - it just attracts people because of how
50:36 - nice it is that's kind of the difference
50:39 - and if you want that you need to hire an
50:41 - architect that's you know that knows
50:42 - what they're doing and as you know some
50:45 - creative ability and an interior
50:46 - designer you know a decorator so
50:50 - hopefully that answered your question I
50:52 - probably spent too much time on that so
50:54 - sorry if I
50:55 - kind of over answered that let's see
51:13 - so I'm just I'm just getting through I'm
51:15 - almost to the end here of what's on the
51:16 - live chat all right so here's requested
51:27 - aft derp says is it better to have a
51:30 - main parent component and render that to
51:32 - the Dom or is it just the same to have
51:35 - many parents all separately rendered to
51:38 - the Dom competitor that's a no-no 70
51:45 - suppose I'm not like a hundred percent
51:48 - sure how to answer the question um let
51:52 - me just show you I haven't showed you
51:54 - any of the react stuff yet so let me
51:57 - just briefly kind of show you how a page
51:59 - works and it doesn't have to work like
52:01 - this
52:02 - this is kind of how things work in next
52:04 - when you're using next to build react
52:06 - stuff like this is my index so within
52:10 - this index file and I like that maybe
52:13 - I'm not really answering your question
52:14 - here but I'll give it a shot you know
52:17 - within my index this is actually it's
52:21 - not a good example because I'm not
52:22 - pulling in anything any other components
52:25 - really let's go to resources that's a
52:27 - better example
52:28 - so I'm importing all these other
52:30 - components these child components and
52:32 - I'm pulling them in so you know the
52:39 - sticky nav components here the title
52:40 - components here all these all the cards
52:44 - that I have on the page were just
52:45 - iterating over this data and then adding
52:48 - these cards to the page and that's a
52:50 - separate component so that's that's how
52:54 - I've been doing things I'm sure there
52:56 - are other ways to do things hopefully
52:58 - that clarified a little bit let me know
53:01 - if it didn't and I'll try later on maybe
53:03 - to give you a better explanation
53:05 - I had asked a few minutes ago about the
53:09 - different like using the - or the
53:11 - underscore for PHP and it seems like the
53:14 - underscore was kind of the way I should
53:16 - have gone and Jake says the underscore
53:21 - is the way to go but then you have an
53:23 - underscore in the URL and you don't want
53:25 - that so actually now that you
53:27 - that I remember that is the reason that
53:31 - is the reason why I did it like this and
53:35 - not on this site but on like months ago
53:39 - when I first started working with this I
53:42 - had used underscore and then it I didn't
53:46 - like then I ended up having to use
53:48 - underscores later on in other places and
53:51 - I didn't want to use underscores
53:53 - everywhere so that's why I did go with
53:55 - the - so thank you Thank You Jay
54:01 - reminded me of that and the Patrick says
54:05 - rickrolling clients priceless
54:07 - yeah it is pretty funny I actually got
54:11 - my I think I got my boss with that
54:13 - before um yeah it's funny but yeah I
54:18 - normally I don't do that for client
54:20 - sites but I think I may still have some
54:24 - WordPress installs where if you try to
54:26 - go to like the admin page you get
54:28 - rickrolled because I've changed the I
54:30 - change the URL for the login for the
54:33 - admin just to mess with somebody who
54:35 - might be trying to like get into my site
54:39 - and they're not supposed to be in there
54:43 - alright so let's get to I don't want to
54:46 - get completely off track here
54:49 - where we're going here we go let me show
54:53 - you how we're going to customize this
54:55 - for editing so I have a plug-in called
54:59 - advanced custom fields and it gives me
55:04 - this extra menu item there's a pro
55:06 - version of advanced custom fields but
55:08 - there's a free version in this case the
55:10 - free version does everything that I
55:12 - needed to do so it's fine I have used
55:15 - the pro version in other sites and it
55:18 - has some functionality that if you need
55:20 - it it definitely saves you time it's
55:22 - worth the money I think it was like 25
55:25 - dollars per site where you could pay
55:26 - $100 and use it on as many sites as you
55:28 - wanted I think it was in Australian
55:30 - dollars too so I'm not sure what that
55:32 - what that came out to and US dollars I
55:35 - think it ended up being cheaper in US
55:37 - dollars but at least at the time
55:41 - so let's go into we're going to add new
55:45 - and you get title let's go to ministry
55:50 - tracks info um I will say this you
55:58 - everything I'm about to do with this
55:59 - plugin you can do in PHP and just code
56:02 - it yourself I found that that was kind
56:06 - of would take too much time for me just
56:09 - because of my lack of experience with
56:10 - PHP if you're good with PHP give it a
56:13 - shot and that's one less plug-in you
56:15 - have to worry about but I kind of this
56:20 - is nice this this works it's free it's
56:24 - well maintained plug-in it consistently
56:26 - updated so I definitely recommend it and
56:30 - I get no I'm not sponsored by this
56:35 - plug-in so this is an honest
56:37 - recommendation I get nothing for that so
56:39 - what we're going to do here is want to
56:43 - say when the post type equals alright so
56:46 - when it equals ministry track okay then
56:51 - all this stuff that we're about to do
56:54 - will apply okay so we're going to apply
56:56 - it to just that one and we have some
57:02 - options as to where this is going to
57:03 - display it's not really a big deal it's
57:06 - your preference usually if the field is
57:08 - like really important I don't want
57:09 - people to miss it I put it high right
57:11 - after the title but you can put anywhere
57:14 - you want this like display style is um
57:18 - totally up to you in terms of your
57:20 - preferences I found that this the
57:23 - seamless kind of looks cooler but the
57:25 - standard fits in better with WordPress
57:27 - so it's like it looks more like it's
57:30 - supposed to be there and then here's a
57:33 - place the place where we can actually
57:34 - hide a lot of stuff that we don't need
57:37 - so I'm just going to hide everything for
57:39 - now because we're only going to show a
57:41 - few things so we don't want the
57:42 - permalink as I said because that'll take
57:44 - you it'll take them to the wrong place
57:46 - it'll be misleading we do want the
57:49 - content editor
57:50 - this post I don't always add this and
57:52 - what we want that we don't want the
57:54 - excerpt we don't want any of the normal
57:57 - custom fields because we're going to add
57:59 - our own custom fields here
58:02 - we don't want discussion comments
58:03 - because we're not going to have people
58:07 - be commenting on this custom post type
58:10 - we do want revisions so that they could
58:12 - go back and see what's been changed we
58:14 - do want the slug in case I need to
58:19 - double check what the slug is you know
58:21 - if I'm trying to troubleshoot something
58:24 - we're going to keep the author and that
58:26 - way people can see who's worked on that
58:30 - post before we don't need format because
58:33 - that has to do with the layout of a
58:34 - WordPress theme and we're not using the
58:36 - WordPress theme we're going to keep
58:38 - featured image because at some point I
58:41 - think we're going to add images to that
58:42 - section so I'm just going to leave it in
58:43 - there for now even though right now if
58:46 - you put an image in there it wouldn't
58:47 - display at all on our site in fact we
58:51 - haven't linked this up to our site at
58:52 - all so it has it is actually not going
58:54 - to display depending on we're not going
58:58 - to have time in this stream but maybe in
59:00 - a future stream we can link this up I
59:02 - know I've already showed how to do that
59:05 - in a previous stream but maybe it would
59:07 - be cool to do have like the whole thing
59:08 - in order now we'll see let me know if
59:11 - you're interested in that we are not
59:13 - going to add any categories or tags at
59:16 - this point we could always add it in
59:18 - later but I don't really see any need
59:20 - for this because of what we're going to
59:22 - be using this for we don't need that if
59:24 - this were more like a blog style thing
59:26 - we would leave these and we don't need
59:30 - the Trackbacks so we've got rid of a lot
59:34 - of the stuff on the page if I wanted to
59:37 - do a custom field which I don't need for
59:40 - this one but let's just say I go here to
59:42 - add a field I can add a label so I'm
59:45 - just going to do some nonsense here it
59:47 - gives it this field name this is the
59:49 - name of the field that will show up in
59:53 - the in the JSON so let me show you a guy
59:58 - here so like anything that you put here
60:02 - will show up under this
60:04 - çf section in your JSON and this is the
60:08 - name so you'll need to use this name in
60:11 - your API call and then no not in the API
60:15 - code you'll need to use this name when
60:17 - you're rendering out the contents of
60:19 - this so you can choose a field type to a
60:24 - lot of different things you can choose
60:26 - from and then if you get the pro version
60:29 - there's even more you can have some
60:33 - instructions so this is really important
60:34 - if you're making it for clients you know
60:36 - really spell out exactly what you want
60:38 - in that field and how it how you want it
60:41 - to be formatted you can make it required
60:42 - or not you can give it a default value
60:44 - placeholder text right so you can even
60:48 - said okay where do I want this this text
60:50 - to go so it really kind of nitpicky
60:52 - things as to how you want to align this
60:54 - but you know might be important this I
60:57 - almost always choose no formatting
61:00 - unless there's some really good reason
61:02 - why I want people to be able to use HTML
61:06 - in in whatever text area that is okay so
61:11 - normally not I don't use that and
61:14 - occasionally you don't want to character
61:16 - limit so for these I don't need a
61:21 - character limit because if you remember
61:23 - on the page we're just showing and
61:24 - hiding them so it's really not going to
61:26 - be a big deal to have them be super long
61:28 - because they won't be immediately
61:30 - displayed to the user won't make the
61:31 - page really long so we're not going to
61:33 - have a character limit there but I would
61:37 - recommend this for for things that you
61:38 - don't want to make super long because it
61:40 - would look bad put the character limit
61:42 - in there and then usually people who
61:45 - don't know about websites have a
61:46 - tendency to write way too much text and
61:49 - in general on a website you want less
61:51 - text you know unless you're writing a
61:54 - blog post or something then that's
61:56 - understandable but you know if it's on
61:58 - like your home page you to you know just
62:00 - skip out people never read all the text
62:02 - in any way so try to keep it short and
62:06 - to the point so that's basically it I
62:09 - would add this field and I don't really
62:13 - want to keep it but I'll just add it
62:15 - just for demonstration
62:16 - purposes and I'm going to publish this
62:20 - now when I go back up here to ministry
62:23 - tracks and I go to add new we can see it
62:27 - looks a bit different we don't have the
62:28 - excerpt anymore actually there's no
62:33 - option to get rid of these sharing
62:34 - buttons I am this is not going to hurt
62:38 - anything but actually if I can figure
62:40 - out how to get rid of this I may as well
62:41 - because it's kind of pointless in them I
62:44 - just be distracting so basically we have
62:47 - our all we have is just what we wanted
62:48 - to include our title our content our
62:51 - main content editor and then here's our
62:53 - field so we added one field here and
62:55 - then we just added another one in dis
62:56 - left at blank but that's where they
63:00 - would go like if we wanted to we could
63:02 - have this display up here but that's it
63:08 - you can see it just it looks like it's
63:10 - meant to be there if blends in really
63:12 - well with everything and that's where it
63:15 - added so at this point what I would do
63:17 - to kind of complete this process for
63:19 - this post type is I would go in here and
63:26 - basically at this point I would probably
63:28 - copy and paste or I would probably have
63:31 - somebody else do it because that's a
63:32 - little bit of kind of a waste of my time
63:34 - to just copy and paste so if I had maybe
63:35 - like a student worker who needed to get
63:38 - some hours in and maybe I would have
63:40 - them copy and paste this into here fill
63:44 - out all the tracks once I have the data
63:46 - in there then I would go in and pull
63:50 - this in so just like I'm doing here with
63:52 - these resources where I get I can make a
63:55 - call to the API here with fetch and then
63:58 - I get that data back I showed you what
64:00 - the JSON looks like and then I use that
64:03 - data down here to populate the page so
64:08 - that's what I would do for the the page
64:12 - the courses page with the ministry
64:13 - checks exactly like that so you can go
64:16 - and get up right now and check out this
64:17 - code and just kind of see what the next
64:18 - step would be just by checking out one
64:22 - of the pages where I'm actually
64:23 - importing data where you see this get
64:24 - initial props at the top of the
64:26 - component so that's it so I've come in
64:30 - it just slightly over an hours so we
64:33 - kind of hit our goal today of being
64:35 - about an hour I am going to keep going
64:39 - for a couple more minutes just to answer
64:40 - your questions so if you were only here
64:42 - for the code you can stop watching now
64:44 - and thanks for watching but if you do
64:48 - have a few more minutes to stick around
64:49 - for some questions go ahead and put your
64:53 - questions in the live chat and I will
64:55 - try to answer as many as I can as best I
64:59 - can
64:59 - and if your if you don't want to put
65:06 - your question in the live chat if you're
65:07 - a little nervous about that you can put
65:09 - it in a direct message to me on Twitter
65:12 - my Twitter a link to my Twitter account
65:15 - is in the description for this video or
65:18 - if you can't stick around for the answer
65:20 - you can put the question in the comments
65:22 - to this video and I will get to it I do
65:25 - read all your comments and everything
65:27 - that everyone sends me I read it all
65:28 - sometimes it takes me a few days to get
65:30 - to it but I do read it all and I will
65:33 - respond alright so let me get to to some
65:39 - of this live chat let's see there's not
65:42 - a whole lot here so the question answer
65:44 - session might be pretty short today
65:47 - which that's fine because I so some of
65:50 - you evidently are like staying up really
65:52 - late to watch this because your time
65:54 - zones are a lot different than my time
65:55 - zone so I appreciate that that you know
65:59 - you you like the screen enough to to
66:03 - stay up like that but I don't want to
66:04 - keep you up too late every night so I'll
66:07 - try to be shorter than normal
66:10 - let's see I'm going through I'm trying
66:13 - to find a question here that I haven't
66:15 - already addressed so haven't found very
66:18 - much yet okay Sebastian asked can't you
66:22 - redirect WP cat attack etics com2 the
66:25 - real site yeah so I thought of that
66:28 - before so just for some context here I
66:31 - had said before that on the WordPress
66:36 - select
66:38 - normally when you do something in
66:40 - WordPress and you save a post there'll
66:42 - be a link here where you
66:44 - check out your post or preview so
66:46 - there's a preview button you preview it
66:47 - with the way I've set it up here if you
66:51 - click this preview it's going to take
66:52 - you not to the site that you should go
66:56 - to not to catechetical comm but it's
66:57 - going to try to take you to the site
67:00 - that would be there if we were using the
67:03 - wordpress template and I usually just
67:06 - completely disable the template so it'll
67:08 - basically take you to a blank page but
67:10 - you know at best it's just you know it's
67:13 - misleading for people try to click that
67:16 - and they think oh wow this isn't what
67:18 - it's supposed to look like or they think
67:19 - hey this site is broken what happened so
67:22 - I just take that out I mean I I can take
67:25 - out the preview button if I really
67:27 - wanted to get into it into editing but
67:29 - I'm not super worried about that right
67:30 - now
67:31 - Sebastian is saying couldn't you just
67:33 - make all that redirect to the right
67:36 - place on the on the actual catechetical
67:39 - home site and I think that's probably
67:44 - possible and I'd like to do that there's
67:48 - actually another site that I did I can't
67:50 - show you it's a it's like an internal
67:52 - web site and my my bosses want it to be
67:56 - they want it to stay private it's
67:59 - basically just an internal bulletin
68:00 - realistically like 90% or more of the
68:03 - content there's no reason why I couldn't
68:05 - be public and it probably is public
68:06 - elsewhere but I'm not allowed to show it
68:10 - but I will say that the person in my
68:13 - department who has two input content for
68:16 - that has requested before that that
68:18 - exact feature of either that she can
68:20 - preview what it's going to look like so
68:22 - I'm working on a way to do that I would
68:25 - like it to be able to for there to be a
68:27 - feature where she can upload things and
68:30 - be able to preview it and see it on a
68:33 - page on the site I didn't actually build
68:36 - it with react I made like a single page
68:38 - app but I did it in like jQuery which
68:41 - that's that site was kind of small
68:43 - enough that it wasn't too much of a mess
68:45 - but I wouldn't want to do that again
68:47 - that was before I was confident enough
68:49 - with react to build it so I'd like to
68:54 - make a set page the
68:56 - only she would be able to see that she
68:59 - would be able to preview because right
69:02 - now if she puts something in it you know
69:06 - it's live so like it may only be live
69:09 - for a second but she has to make it live
69:11 - to see what it's really going to look
69:12 - like which I mean that's not really a
69:14 - good option so I mean I I definitely
69:16 - should have in hindsight I should have
69:19 - made that so that you there was some
69:22 - type of preview feature built in but it
69:26 - generally works there's not really a lot
69:28 - of leeway with how you can enter the
69:29 - content for that site but I'm definitely
69:31 - working on that and if I get a solution
69:35 - to it maybe I'll show you like on a demo
69:38 - site since I can't show you the actual
69:40 - site because that seems like it would be
69:42 - valuable if you're trying to have a
69:44 - similar set up to this all right
69:50 - okay so daftar have said that data
69:52 - answers question see that that question
69:55 - was about I almost called you a he I'm
69:57 - not sure if you he or she is sorry about
69:58 - that
69:59 - so dafter asked a question about how you
70:03 - set up how you render the components and
70:06 - things and react so I'm glad that that
70:08 - they'd answer your question authority
70:13 - Thor is here is that he nearly missed it
70:15 - again
70:18 - sorry you're missing it is it I don't I
70:21 - don't know why you're missing it is it a
70:23 - weird like it's it's usually a 2 p.m.
70:26 - Eastern Time so for some reason it seems
70:30 - like you're coming in an hour late is
70:32 - that like you just can't make it earlier
70:34 - or what how to make one too many
70:40 - relationship between custom posts so
70:43 - Andrew asks how to make one of many
70:45 - relationship between custom posts Andrew
70:47 - I'm not exactly sure what you're asking
70:50 - if you're still watching could you
70:52 - explain a little bit more because I'd
70:54 - like to answer your question but I don't
70:56 - I don't think I understand it well
70:57 - enough right now to give you a good
70:58 - answer Thor says it's 9:00 p.m. here
71:04 - should not really a problem alright so
71:07 - this is 9 p.m. there
71:09 - tomorrow watch it start watching at 8
71:11 - p.m. there and then you will be here on
71:13 - time if you can also for those of you
71:17 - who are watching really late all the
71:19 - time
71:19 - there may be some times where I have to
71:21 - do an earlier stream so that might be
71:23 - more convenient for you I'm thinking
71:25 - like they're definitely going to be some
71:27 - Monday's where I'll have meetings at 1
71:29 - that will probably go really long so
71:31 - I'll probably have to switch it up so
71:33 - far I've been able to skip some of those
71:36 - meetings because it wasn't really
71:37 - relevant for me but I think I'm going to
71:39 - have to start going to a few of them so
71:41 - just heads up on that so there will be a
71:43 - little change in time but that might be
71:44 - good for some people maybe some some
71:47 - people that can't you only watch live
71:48 - may be able to Jake says nice job Jesse
71:52 - I think you cleared some concepts that
71:54 - took me quite some time to figure out on
71:57 - my own
71:58 - awesome I'm glad I could be of some
72:01 - assistance to you Jake Roland says today
72:05 - is stark contrast to yesterday's it's
72:07 - just 12:35 a.m. we went to 2:10 a.m.
72:10 - yesterday yeah yesterday was super long
72:12 - I was I was actually super exhausted I
72:15 - remember yesterday I said I had to go to
72:17 - the store and pick up some stuff I was
72:19 - so exhausted after the livestream
72:21 - yesterday that I didn't I went home and
72:23 - just relaxed because I couldn't I
72:27 - couldn't even make it I was super hungry
72:28 - and tired and I thought I'm not going to
72:31 - try to go to the store now I'll probably
72:33 - buy everything and because I'm so hungry
72:36 - and tired
72:39 - let's see Thor asks why are you using
72:42 - WordPress oh ok sorry there's one before
72:46 - that so smilers asked what application
72:49 - is it I'm not sure what you're referring
72:52 - to I think I'm missing something so
72:54 - smile is a type of redactors you okay
72:59 - what type / - is using for code you mean
73:02 - that code editor uh it's if you mean my
73:07 - code editor I'm using Adam if you mean
73:10 - like the framework I'm using react on
73:14 - the on the front-end side of things to
73:18 - render everything and then I'm using
73:20 - WordPress
73:21 - to manage the content but I'm not using
73:24 - the template system that WordPress has
73:27 - so hopefully that answers your question
73:31 - let me know if it didn't so Thor says
73:34 - why are you using WordPress for this
73:35 - purpose is there nothing better for this
73:37 - for example a simple Django application
73:40 - or something like this the two main
73:46 - reasons why I'm using WordPress for this
73:48 - is number one because a lot of people
73:51 - who have no experience at all with code
73:52 - are going to be editing this and there's
73:54 - going to be a high turnover rate for
73:57 - people who are editing this so they need
73:58 - to be able to be trained very quickly
74:00 - and use this so WordPress is very user
74:03 - friendly in that way the second reason
74:05 - is because this site was a really tough
74:08 - schedule I didn't really have time to
74:09 - learn anything and I don't know
74:11 - something like Django
74:12 - I do I have done this exact thing with
74:15 - WordPress in the past so I knew that I
74:18 - could get it done on time if I did it
74:20 - this way so that's generally not a great
74:23 - idea to use something just because hey I
74:25 - know how to do it I'm just going to keep
74:27 - doing it this way but in this case it
74:30 - actually did work out well for the
74:33 - project so if on future projects if I
74:36 - have more time and it would work out
74:38 - better I'm definitely open to using
74:39 - something other than WordPress for
74:41 - content management actually let me know
74:43 - in the live chat or in the comments what
74:46 - you would recommend using if I if we
74:49 - weren't using WordPress what should have
74:53 - been used what do you think and maybe if
74:56 - I get some time I'll check out your
74:57 - suggestions and see because I'm I'm
74:59 - certainly open WordPress is a little bit
75:01 - of a resource hog it can be on the
75:02 - server so something more lightweight as
75:05 - long as it's still user friendly for for
75:08 - people who don't know about code I would
75:11 - definitely be open to using the other
75:12 - thing is WordPress has a huge user base
75:14 - and there's a lot of great documentation
75:16 - on it so that's really helpful for me at
75:19 - times when I need to do some custom
75:20 - things with it
75:24 - hooligan soft says hey hey what's up
75:29 - thanks for watching
75:32 - door says testing and production is
75:37 - great yeah I don't have a copy of the
75:43 - WordPress install either locally or on
75:46 - another server I'm thinking about
75:48 - getting one it's probably a good idea to
75:52 - get one I probably should do it but I
75:54 - just don't have a setup right now to be
75:55 - honest with you I'm a little bit
75:57 - intimidating with the idea of like how
75:59 - do I sync up the database do I have two
76:01 - separate databases and try to keep them
76:02 - in sync do I pull from the same database
76:04 - but if I do that is that really like a
76:08 - decent development environment you know
76:10 - because so whatever I don't know how to
76:13 - do that there is somebody else Brian
76:15 - works with me here and he has worked
76:18 - more with stuff like this and using
76:20 - WordPress and databases so I'm gonna
76:22 - maybe talk to him a little bit about
76:24 - that and see what he recommends in terms
76:27 - of having a like a testing environment
76:28 - or test you know a testing development
76:32 - server and if you all have any input on
76:36 - that I would appreciate it as well
76:38 - because I probably should have it you
76:40 - know in general you should never be
76:42 - editing a site live if if you don't have
76:45 - to if it's not an emergency hooligan
76:49 - soft says can you make tutorials from
76:50 - making WordPress theme from scratch um
76:53 - that would be really cool unfortunately
76:56 - I don't think I could make a good
76:58 - tutorial on making a wordpress theme
76:59 - from scratch because to do a theme from
77:03 - scratch you have to have some knowledge
77:05 - of PHP at least enough to do the
77:08 - WordPress PHP thing and I'm not
77:11 - confident in my skills to do that so I
77:14 - do know how to do a lot of customization
77:17 - from scratch I have I have honestly I
77:20 - have built a really basic theme from
77:22 - scratch before but that was a long time
77:25 - ago so I don't think I could do it
77:27 - justice I wouldn't feel comfortable
77:30 - putting out a tutorial like that I mean
77:33 - you all know I mean I attempt a lot of
77:35 - things that where I don't really know
77:37 - what I'm doing so I'm not opposed to
77:39 - doing that but to actually do like a
77:41 - from beginning to end tutorial on
77:43 - something I would want to be more
77:45 - knowledge of
77:45 - also but if anyone else knows of a good
77:48 - tutorial to make a theme from scratch
77:50 - please you know let let us know in the
77:54 - live chat or in the comments so that it
77:57 - can be a nice resource for whoever needs
77:59 - to do that rohan says i don't know how
78:02 - WP handles content but you can have an
78:05 - internal temp entry and use preview to
78:08 - generate page from that ok that's
78:11 - interesting I will have to keep that in
78:16 - mind and maybe look look up some more on
78:18 - that I'm just thinking about that for a
78:23 - second ok thank you for that suggestion
78:26 - andrew says is front end served by
78:28 - wordpress or some node app it's a node
78:31 - it's a node app so Andrew I'm using on a
78:34 - set to WordPress lives on one
78:36 - digitalocean droplet and then on another
78:39 - droplet we're really to other droplets I
78:41 - have clones of a node app it's react
78:46 - that actually renders all the data that
78:49 - it's getting from WordPress through the
78:50 - WordPress API and there's there's a load
78:53 - balancer that your shifts traffic
78:55 - between those two copies of the the node
78:58 - app another thing that I didn't mention
79:03 - when I was talking about WordPress that
79:04 - I'll mention briefly I just remembered
79:06 - the cool thing about using the WordPress
79:07 - API for this is the same content that
79:09 - you put into WordPress you can use for
79:12 - your website
79:13 - you could potentially add a theme on to
79:15 - this and have a traditional WordPress
79:17 - site if you wanted to there's nothing
79:18 - stopping you from doing that as well you
79:20 - can pull the data into anything that can
79:23 - get anything that can use an API a REST
79:27 - API and get in can process JSON data so
79:30 - and any app probably some Internet of
79:33 - Things stuff I've actually had an idea
79:35 - to make an Alexa skill for the Amazon
79:37 - echo that would pull data from the
79:39 - WordPress API and like read you the blog
79:42 - posts so I don't know if somebody's
79:45 - already done that and you know about it
79:47 - let me know and then maybe I won't do it
79:49 - because it's been done already but if it
79:52 - hasn't been done I'd like to do it and
79:53 - or if you want to take my idea and do it
79:56 - first just let me know because I think
79:58 - be cool just to use I won't be mad if
80:01 - you steal my idea but that's kind of
80:05 - cool that you could use it in a lot of
80:06 - different places so they'd all lives in
80:08 - one place and it's all easily editable
80:10 - and like imagine like if you wanted to
80:12 - keep everything in your organization all
80:14 - sync together in terms of the you know
80:18 - let's say you have like a business and
80:21 - you wanted like your times that you're
80:22 - open or even like on let's say your
80:25 - restaurant you change your menu
80:27 - frequently well you change your menu
80:29 - here in one place and it automatically
80:31 - syncs to you know you're at let's say
80:33 - you had an app I know this would be
80:34 - weird for a restaurant to have an app to
80:36 - and an Alexa skill and all this and now
80:39 - all of a sudden all the data is updated
80:41 - instantly everywhere there's some
80:42 - definitely some value in that and can
80:44 - save whoever's editing your content it
80:46 - saves them a lot of time all right let
80:49 - me continue on I'm nearly at the end
80:51 - here the live chat so where the stream
80:55 - is getting longer and in spite of my my
80:57 - efforts to make it shorter today it
80:59 - keeps going longer so sorry about that I
81:05 - just you know I don't want to leave you
81:07 - all hanging if you have questions so I
81:09 - definitely let's say this I want to try
81:11 - to cut it off at an hour and a half so
81:14 - that'll be in ten minutes we'll cut it
81:16 - off even if I haven't gotten through
81:17 - everything and then maybe I'll just try
81:20 - to answer your questions like maybe at
81:21 - the beginning of the next stream like
81:23 - tomorrow stream if I don't get to them
81:25 - all let's see Thoris will try it's not a
81:33 - time problem where something is just
81:35 - probably remembering it she probably set
81:38 - up reminder event or something okay all
81:41 - right cool Thor that's the Souris
81:44 - talking that's we were talking about
81:45 - that the time that he was kind of late
81:47 - getting in here to watch it so it's just
81:50 - a remembering thing so cool if you um if
81:54 - you're not already subscribed to the
81:56 - free code can't channel I think though
81:58 - if you have your notifications turned on
82:00 - and you subscribe I think they will
82:02 - alert you so you'll get like if you have
82:04 - the YouTube app it will alert on your
82:07 - phone you're going to notification
82:09 - or it can do like desktop notifications
82:12 - as well so that might be helpful to you
82:15 - I also post on Twitter usually like
82:19 - beforehand so that could be another
82:21 - reminder Andrew says custom post author
82:26 - custom post book add books to author
82:30 - okay so Andrews clarified its earlier
82:33 - question about how to make relationships
82:39 - between custom posts so yeah this is
82:43 - possible let me think for a second
82:47 - because I'm I have worked with this sort
82:51 - of thing before it's been a long time so
82:53 - let me let me just think for a second to
82:55 - make sure I I remember what's going on
83:03 - okay so here's what you can do um I do I
83:11 - believe in WordPress you can make so you
83:13 - would have the two custom posts write
83:15 - author and book that books to author how
83:20 - did I do this before
83:27 - you know what I think I didn't solve it
83:29 - in the best way so I wanted to be able
83:31 - to add books to author and Link it but I
83:33 - think what I ended up doing instead was
83:39 - did I make a taxonomy I may have made a
83:42 - taxonomy or some so I don't think I
83:44 - solved it correctly but I think it's
83:45 - possible I just don't I don't know how I
83:48 - can't remember exactly how I did a
83:50 - similar thing so I don't want to give
83:52 - you an answer so sorry I can't give you
83:55 - a good answer on that but I can tell you
83:59 - that I'm I'm almost positive that it's
84:01 - possible because I did look into it
84:02 - before I just
84:03 - I either couldn't get it working or it
84:05 - didn't seem like I needed it that much
84:08 - that it was worth the time but I I mean
84:12 - that's that's definitely something that
84:13 - comes up so I'm sure the answers is out
84:18 - there Jake says luca node who's pulling
84:26 - data from workforce api ok awesome so
84:28 - jake had already answered the question
84:30 - so sorry I should have read ahead and
84:32 - then I wouldn't have had to answer that
84:36 - John says I'm late for any fix all right
84:38 - sorry John you can watch the replay the
84:41 - replay will be oh man so we had a couple
84:44 - people who were late so the replay will
84:46 - be available in like a minute after I
84:49 - end this stream so I mean if you want to
84:52 - participate in the questions and stuff
84:54 - just add them in the comments below the
84:56 - video
84:59 - andrew says we're press gives you fast
85:01 - bootstrapper back-end and already has
85:03 - json api enabled with all endpoints yes
85:07 - excellent that's that's a great point
85:09 - yeah you you don't have to build any of
85:11 - that it just it comes it's just there
85:14 - and if you're using like managed hosting
85:17 - or you know like like GoDaddy or
85:20 - something like that they're like you
85:22 - know regular shared hosting account
85:23 - there's usually a one-click install for
85:26 - WordPress and it takes five minutes so
85:28 - in five minutes you have a REST API you
85:31 - know that's that's really easy so I'm
85:35 - sure they're probably better ways to
85:37 - build an eight
85:38 - but if you don't know how to do that I
85:40 - don't have time to mess with that then I
85:42 - mean you can't beat that that's that's
85:44 - just simple really simple Thor says ok
85:47 - thanks for answering never heard people
85:49 - using WordPress for this purpose just
85:50 - wondering yeah it's actually it's kind
85:52 - of new or the WordPress API has been
85:54 - around for a couple of years but it's
85:55 - been in like beta stage for a while it's
85:58 - only within the last year I think that
86:00 - it's it's like officially part of
86:03 - WordPress core used to be you had to get
86:05 - a separate plug-in and enable it and
86:07 - stuff so for a while there it was
86:10 - recommended not to use it on production
86:12 - sites I did still use it anyway because
86:14 - in my experience like it worked there
86:17 - were very few breaking changes that ever
86:19 - occurred and if it did happen it was
86:22 - well documented so I never had a problem
86:25 - with it but it's it's only recently that
86:28 - it's I think like at a stable enough
86:32 - point that a lot of people are starting
86:33 - to use it
86:35 - Andrew says yes is a good practice to
86:37 - keep staging in production even local in
86:40 - sync
86:41 - yeah that's the that's the goal that's
86:44 - what I should have set up so I pretty
86:48 - much have that for the node um a part of
86:52 - this but just not for the WordPress part
86:55 - Andrew says this is how WordPress that
86:58 - WordPress takes templates in theme I'm
87:04 - not sure what that was in response to
87:06 - Andrew so I don't remember I mean what I
87:10 - was talking about at that point so sorry
87:13 - Jordan says what size drop list ease
87:16 - actually so this is really cool um Oh
87:21 - Roland says the stream keeps dropping I
87:24 - haven't been watching the the stream
87:26 - stats oh I didn't see sorry about that
87:30 - actually when it goes that's weird okay
87:35 - sorry it was dropping right now it seems
87:36 - it's it's holding I'm like over 5,000
87:40 - kilobits per second so it should be good
87:43 - right now so sorry about the drop I mean
87:46 - obviously I don't really have control
87:48 - over that can
87:49 - action but I usually have a really good
87:50 - connection at work so Jordan the droplet
87:54 - size I'm using five-dollar droplets for
87:57 - everything so the to clone like no
88:01 - droplets are both five-dollar droplets
88:02 - and then WordPress's on a five dollar
88:04 - droplet usually it's recommended not to
88:06 - go with the $5 for WordPress but because
88:09 - I'm using it in this way just the
88:11 - headless part of WordPress and it's not
88:13 - having to do any like rendering of
88:15 - templates at all I've found that I can
88:18 - get away with putting WordPress on a
88:20 - five-dollar droplet and it's still
88:22 - really fast and it holds up
88:25 - I definitely be a point where if I get
88:27 - too much traffic I would have to upgrade
88:29 - it but that's actually been really nice
88:31 - that I'm able to to run it on a
88:35 - five-dollar droplet I'm also going to
88:37 - take advantage of once once all the post
88:40 - types and everything really get bailed
88:42 - out I'm going to turn on caching for the
88:44 - API and that's going to decrease the
88:46 - load on WordPress even further and then
88:49 - I do have caching set within node at the
88:53 - server level and then there's also
88:55 - caching going on on the client side with
88:58 - the serviceworker so there are three
89:01 - levels of caching if I have time I may
89:05 - even route this through CloudFlare and
89:08 - so there will essentially be four levels
89:11 - of caching going on so once if a request
89:15 - even got all the way back to WordPress
89:18 - it would be somewhat rare so it'll allow
89:22 - me it will allow me to run these on very
89:26 - cheap droplets because I'm kind of
89:30 - protecting them from the brunt of all
89:33 - the traffic that you would normally have
89:34 - on a wordpress site so so for right now
89:38 - that works I think is pretty cool that I
89:39 - can run it on lower droplets I mean not
89:41 - that I need to I'm sure you know for
89:43 - this project there was there was a
89:45 - budget that was large enough that I
89:46 - could have done a larger droplet but
89:47 - there's really no reason to the site is
89:49 - running very quickly and at least for me
89:54 - from from my testing it's been running
89:56 - very quick
89:57 - and the API calls are coming back you
90:00 - know very very fast you know within
90:02 - milliseconds
90:06 - let's see Jonathan says there's a PHP
90:10 - myadmin on your host server where
90:11 - WordPress is hosted this gives you full
90:13 - capabilities to run sequel off the
90:15 - database on the backend as well yeah
90:19 - actually I don't have PHP myadmin
90:22 - installed when I run WordPress on
90:24 - digitalocean
90:25 - so I'm not sure I actually had my
90:28 - colleague Brian set up the WordPress
90:30 - instance so he may have installed PHP
90:33 - myadmin or something like that I'll have
90:35 - to ask him about it but um when I've
90:38 - done installs of WordPress on digital
90:40 - ocean
90:41 - I haven't installed anything and if I do
90:43 - need to mess with sequel I've just done
90:45 - it from the command line and that's
90:49 - worked for me if you use a host like for
90:55 - some sites I do have on GoDaddy and I
90:57 - use SiteGround for some sites too
90:59 - those usually come with like cPanel and
91:02 - PHP myadmin so that makes it a lot
91:05 - easier if you have access to PHP myadmin
91:08 - and can use it use that it's way easier
91:11 - than the command line for that normally
91:14 - I do like the command line but for for
91:16 - doing database stuff I don't like it as
91:18 - much
91:20 - all right last andrew says last question
91:23 - for me do you sync your containers
91:25 - databases when using load balancing
91:27 - thanks so so no actually so the
91:30 - containers so the node apps have no
91:34 - databases and those two containers are
91:38 - where the load gets balanced between the
91:40 - API calls all go to just one instance of
91:43 - WordPress so there doesn't need to be
91:47 - any load balancing to there because you
91:49 - know obviously there's just one and
91:50 - that's where the database sits so so no
91:56 - I don't have to deal with syncing that
91:58 - to any of the you know for load
92:01 - balancing purposes
92:06 - okay someone asks and I can't pronounce
92:13 - this because it's in Russian says who is
92:14 - from Russia or who is speaking on
92:16 - Russian let's study together so I don't
92:21 - speak Russian if anybody else speaks
92:23 - Russian then you know get together maybe
92:27 - you guys can study together and you says
92:30 - better use my sequel workbench app to
92:33 - connect to database instead of PHP
92:35 - myadmin which has load on your server
92:37 - all right good to know I'll have to
92:38 - check that up Andrew knows Russian
92:42 - awesome okay and that's the end of the
92:44 - live chat did I make it um two minutes
92:46 - over what I wanted to be so almost made
92:49 - it lost track of time there at the end
92:51 - so still have but we have 32 viewers
92:54 - still even after all that time so a
92:56 - little bit lower than normal but it's
92:59 - been a long stream okay somebody joining
93:02 - us just now hey how's it going thanks
93:05 - for watching
93:07 - so I'll see tomorrow I should be I don't
93:12 - think I have any meetings or anything so
93:13 - it should be same time 2:00 p.m. Eastern
93:15 - Time
93:16 - thanks for watching I and feel free to
93:19 - ask me any questions and I appreciate
93:21 - all the the great interaction we've had
93:24 - in the live chat today and anyway for
93:30 - the for all the people that thumbs down
93:31 - this I had one earlier please let me
93:34 - know why you thumbs down it I won't be
93:36 - upset with you I just want to make it
93:38 - better so thanks for watching have a
93:42 - great day and I will see you tomorrow

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody its Jessie and today I haven't even done anything yet and I already have one thumbs down on this video so I'm not mad about it I just wonder what what did I do I don't have a thumbs down it was already there like ten minutes ago so if you do dislike one of my videos let me know why I don't even care if you mean about it only cry a little bit but let me know why and if you don't want to call me out like in front of other people because you're afraid you know you people get mad about it or whatever just direct message me I won't call you out a few direct message me and are critical or whatever because I want to make this stream better so I really really appreciate all the positive feedback that I get and lately I've been getting a lot of positive feedback I've had some direct messages on Twitter and emails and you all been you know just really awesome and encouraging and I really appreciate that but if you don't like what I'm doing I you know if you have you know two minutes to explain why that would really help me out alright so I want to do two things today one thing obviously is make these custom post types like like the title of this the stream says the other thing though is I want to show you an error that I inadvertently caused when I set up the load balancer and that Sebastian caught so hey so Sebastian he's often in the live chat I don't even remember the last time he missed a live chat but last night Sebastian direct message me on Twitter and sent me a screenshot of some errors that he was seeing and I had not seen these errors before and once I did a little bit of research I found out what the problem is and so I think this is a problem that would be easy to have if you're doing load balancing I mean I've been working with next for a while now probably at least six months I've been working with next maybe longer what month is it yeah probably about six months and I've read through a lot of their documentation and I never saw this before so what's happening is this let me show you it's not gonna show up now I might have to show you on the yeah it's not going to show up here it'll show up on the server so let me bring in my oops actually I could have done it here yep let me bring this in and I'll go to one of these servers and let me let me change the color real quick because I know I had some I think it's there we go if you're using item and you press command I it will bring this up and you can change your colors but I just I haven't figured out how to get it to persist and change everything at once I haven't really taken that much time to try to figure it out the colors there we go maybe a week or two ago I had somebody that said that this black background was was just killing their eyes so I want to lighten it up a bit and so basically I'm going to go into one of the servers if you haven't seen the other videos where I set up load balancing right now this this site which I'll show you here in a second so this site that we've been working on for a while I'm doing this for anybody who's new is a react site and it's running next j/s which basically lets you scaffold your react app and it provides serverside rendering and routing right off the bat so it does a lot of cool stuff for you so you don't have to worry about that and you can just get started in you'll get to working on your app and I guess I had it right here too I didn't have to bring that one over so once I split it on to two different droplets on digitalocean so there's two instances of this app running and then I set up a load balancer I kind of use easy mode I set up the digitalocean load balancer it's like 20 bucks a month and it makes it really easy to do load balancing so at some point I would love to do like a live stream of setting up a load balancer maybe like from scratch and but for now that was a good first step for me into the world of load balancing but what happened that I didn't expect was this I should go so I'm going to open up this file okay so when you build your next app so when you run you know npm run build or yarn build or whatever you want to run it I think it's next build so however you run it it creates a unique ID well you need to build ID so my my deployment process for this is that I develop locally I push all the changes to a github repo and then I log on to the server I pull down the changes from github I build and then I start the app so on the server on one server there's one build ID and then you switch to the other one this is the other one not logged in right now with Logan the other one I have another build ID so there are two different IDs so then what would happen is I would I would come in here and I would click around and react would detect that the build ID was not the idea that it expected so this error wouldn't happen all the time it would only happen from what I could tell from what I read I think it was happening because sometimes part of the site was loading from one server and part from another server so like you know not every page has to load every resource right so you might get you know one request would get sent to one server one droplet and then a request you make a little bit later when you go to a different page might get sent to another one that's what seemed like was happening and then next detected like hey there's there's a difference in these I build ID numbers and it was giving me lots of errors okay so I wonder if I can show I'd like to show you what the errors look like in case you get them so you know let me let me look here at the screenshot that Sebastian sent let me bring this over it's kind of small try to zoom in okay so I can make this bigger so these are the areas that I was getting see invalid build ID basically there were actually two forms of this error there was it was displaying sometimes like this and sometimes it was displaying another way but basically both both times it was saying something about a build build err built idea okay so now we've got rid of those and here's how I fixed it so I was a little bit proud of myself when I thought about this so I didn't come up with it completely on my own I found I found this issue so somebody had had a similar issue and they reported it here in the github repo for next and then after some possible solutions and suggestions down here at some point I may be right around here okay so here's the suggestion to use a different build ID so make manually add a build ID that's the same ok the solution number one was well just build once and then copy that over and run that on two different servers but that's not that wasn't going to work with my deploy process so I didn't want to change my deployment process I want to find a different solution so the solution was just add something in add a step in to your build process that changes that ID to whatever you want it to be and make sure it's the same so the suggestion somewhere in the documentation for next it also suggested you could use the ID for the commit for the latest commit the like the head to the master branch and github I thought that's really cool so that's exactly what I did so check out my package.json here and here's what I added just this part so in the build process now I had this so this command get Rev parse head just gives you the ID and I know some of you probably know all this and this is old news for you but for there's a lot of people who are just starting out who might not be confident in their commandline skills so I'm going to just kind of explain what this does so I'm going to copy this come in in here and if you see this it just returns the ID of the latest commit so that's what we want we want this kind of unique ID but we want it to be different for each build but the same on both on both servers okay and then we're just automatically putting this into this file so if you're not familiar with this basically you know you put the sign in here what is this the greater than sign and then we specify the file and so whatever this returns becomes the contents of this file so it worked I now have those errors are gone the build IDs are now the same so anyway I thought that was a I mean it was a tricky problem for me when I first saw that last night I thought what is going on I have no idea you know what this is but not too bad after a little search so anyway I definitely wanted to point that out because I feel like if anybody had been following what I did with load balancing they probably got a similar error if they were using next as well and I didn't want to leave leave anyone hanging without you know bringing that up and explaining what I did so I mean this is all on github now you could check it out you know and add this to your project if you need to if you're having this error I'm going to check the live chat really quickly because I have some some comments in here before we get into the custom post types oh man Martin says two hours way too much it's a very good topic I liked the video before WordPress API but really two hours is way too much um yeah I kind of agree with you I don't I don't know let me know do you all like when I have the long streams like two hours or do you like it when I used to have a half hour streams so when I first started streaming I tried to set a half hour limit so I would code for like 25 minutes and then I would answer questions for five minutes and then I'd be done because I thought the same way like hey nobody is going to watch the recording of a two hour video but a half hours more doable so let me know what you think it's just some of the more like detailed things that I had to do the more complicated things there is no way I could get it done in 25 minutes so I just kind of kept going so that we could do the whole thing I didn't want to break it up and have you know one thing take like three or four days so let me know I can definitely change it up if if you all think it should be shorter fine otherwise they'll kind of keep it going now I am I am doing I would kind of like to cut it back so it's more like an hour not not the two hours because that is a lot and I found like honestly like after I I'm talking for two hours uh my voice starts to go so I think if I did that every day I would lose my voice by the end of the week so I mean it's not the end of the world if my throat hurts a little bit from this but I think would be better if I still had a voice by the end of the week all right a lot of people saying hi hey everybody thanks for watching okay you you get not sure how to pronounce that I hope I pronounced it right you can says please start the technology from scratch that would help begin increase up their level that everyone up the level that would help everyone thanks you rock awesome thank thank you for the for the positive feedback there I really would like to start from scratch and I probably will end up starting from scratch soon when I move to my next project so this stream in particular is just what I have to do at work anyway I try to pick the most interesting thing that I'm going to do each day and save it for this livestream time and I get a lot of them more boring like copy and paste type of things out of the way early on in the day so sometimes we're doing more complex stuff and sometimes we'll be doing beginner stuff it's just it depends on what I have to work on that day but I know I've been saying this in promising this for a while but I am going to do some tutorial videos that will be prerecorded and in those videos I will go over basic stuff and they'll be really targeted if someone will be targeted just that people who are really at the beginning stages so that is coming I have some outlines already ready for those videos I just need some quiet time to do the videos I've started to do one and then all my kids came home and it was just way too noisy and I don't have an office at home I need I need like to make a little office space where I could do this so anyway let me okay so Jordan says 30 to 60 minutes ok that's reasonable that's kind of the range that I think is probably best for me Rowan says I actually love these two 2.5 hours stream but some topics can certainly be half or one hour ok cool yeah I do I kind of agree with that it it does depend on what we're doing as to the length see best to make sure topics are covered completely but an hour max good okay so an hour max an hour one and a half hours break it up okay so it seems like right around the one hour range seems to be kind of like the median of what people are saying so I'm going to try to keep things like an hour or less I will say a lot of the time at the end does come like we kind of get into a discussion about things so the actual coding time sometimes isn't that much but maybe maybe we can break it up maybe there can actually be a scheduled like question and answer time so that we can split up and have videos that are just coding and then videos that are more Q&A I don't know I have to think about that and see you know when that would be good to do I do I do like the idea Jordan says break it up into different streams multiple streams per day so like instead of making one long stream that's two hours I could do for halfhour streams so yeah that would be a little bit more work just to set all this times up and to make like video thumbnails for that but I guess I could use the same thumbnail and just change part 1 part 2 part 3 so that's that's a good idea I'll think about that one as well sometimes I don't know ahead of time how long a certain thing will take Roland says spontaneous Q&A is better yeah that's what I was thinking the scheduled Q&A might not work out the you know if we do get questions they just kind of flow out of what we're doing Danny says we be doing WordPress development stream yeah so I'm doing I'm going to do that right now sometimes I I'm not going to do a dedicated stream for WordPress like every you know every so often but every day but occasionally I will need to do WordPress stuff because I work with WordPress websites sometimes so we'll be incorporating that so let me get to it it's already been I'm talking here about you know cutting down my stream time and I've already spent the first almost 20 minutes on you know kind of beside the topic I mean now we haven't it was important we were trying to break down and troubleshoot an error so you know that was valuable but I do want to get to it okay somebody's joining an expecting wordpress I don't want to be disappointed so here I have let me move this over and just to show you how we're going to do some of these so I already have some custom post types running and I'm going to bring over my wordpress site as well to show you what post types I have running and what it kind of looks like here so I don't know how familiar you all are with WordPress it's a content management system that's built on PHP and normally the way you use WordPress is you have a theme and that's you know rendered it's you know PHP templates and it's all tied in here with this admin panel and that's how normal WordPress website works you know normally like you know you click a link it's a page refresh and everything everything's rendered on the server using PHP what I'm using WordPress is I'm using the API so all the content still goes in here and basically it's still running PHP behind the scenes but I don't use PHP to render anything okay there the display portion of it what people see with what the client sees you know for instance this is built with react and it lives on a different server than this so when this page loads a request is sent to WordPress saying I want to certain data and then it comes back in JSON format and then I handle on this end sorting it out and rendering it all so WordPress now is in I think the term people use is headless so we're using it as a headless CMS so WordPress isn't usually a headless CMS but we're using it in that way here is that all we care about is content going in here and we don't care about display here we do all the display stuff here so that's just a quick overview in case you're wondering what you know how WordPress ties in with with react and what we're doing I will I'm not going to go into a lot of the why of doing it like this because I've covered it before in videos and in the comments to some of the videos early on but just to to say a little I've found that when I make sites like this they are much faster than traditional WordPress sites that I've done and I'm able to do different things like yesterday we set up it's not live yet but yesterday we set up a like a live search that just automatically gave us search results and it was really cool not that you that's not possible with a normal WordPress site but this gives me a lot of freedom to use the build tools that I want and be able to do everything in JavaScript you know using react instead of having to do a lot of the templating in PHP and now if someone was really good with PHP maybe they'd like to do in a different way but I'm not great with PHP but I know enough to do custom post types so let me show you that what a custom post type is in case you're not case you're not sure so this is one custom post type it's called nearby events so this isn't default in WordPress I just made this name up nearby events will go to add one okay and I've also added some custom fields and we'll probably add some of these today I did not code these custom fields in PHP so what we'll do is I'll show you how to code in PHP the custom post types but then I'll show you the plugin I use as well to do all these fields for me since I'm not really a PHP guy the custom post types are pretty easy to do but all the custom fields were just it was just too much work for me it made more sense to go with a plugin and also if you're not familiar with WordPress plugins will cover it you know in a little while so it'll make more sense but basically I can just set out here's what I want here's all the fields that I want this gets put in here and then the data I get the data basically like this this isn't the same this is data for different custom post type but it gives you the same idea is that this is how I get the data that gets put into here and then I can do whatever I want with this in react okay does that make sense I'll check the live stream if this is like completely confusing to you let me know in the live chat and I can let me know what's confusing and I can't explain it otherwise I'm going to keep keep going and show you how how we set up these post types so there's probably a little delay so I'm going to wait just you know a few more seconds here to see if anybody has a question at this point because if you lost at this point I'd rather like try to catch you up a little bit then then you stay lost let's see okay rowan says you you just request content on api's probably as may be overkill though but better than learning a new CMS she was funny I'm not sure if that was in response was that in response to Danny or what also yeah it probably is overkill but in this particular case I didn't just need to make a site I need to make a site that was very impressive is there because of the circumstances surrounding why I got this project and everything I needed to make it in a very impressive sight that did more than a normal site would so that's part of the reason why I went with this as opposed to just a normal WordPress site there are some other really good reasons why and I think I went over those a previous video so I'll not go over them again here but if you are thinking like like Rohan that maybe this is overkill for just a normal website I I don't completely disagree with that but if you can make something better and you have the time to do it and the ability well you know why not do it alright so I'm going to continue I didn't have anybody say ok so that Rowan said that wasn't response to Danny so that's what I thought I just wanted to Claire this clarification okay Jake says overkill maybe it depends on whether or not you're doing edits are passing the site off the clients yeah okay Jake I'm glad that you are I'm glad you said that Jordan also mentions building custom CMS is a lot of work definitely a lot of work and Jake says WordPress really easy to understand for non techie people good I'm glad that that you both brought up those points because this this is exactly why I chose WordPress as the CMS because it's so easy for non tech people to use I'm not going to be maintaining this site in terms of content which is great I don't I don't ever want to maintain content on a site I just want to build new sites and make them better so other people so grad students who are getting their degree here I work at the University who are getting their you know their master's degree here and are trying to make a little bit extra money you know while they're in school so I can pay their rent and everything they're going to be up updating the content so the people updating this are constantly going to change it's probably going to be a new person every year every two years they may or may not have any experience okay so they're not getting their degree in anything computer related so they need something that's as simple as possible so the idea is I make pretty much everything that makes sense edit able through WordPress and then I make some tutorial videos so that the new person would just be able to watch you know a playlist of tutorials and they would be able to go in here and make any edits so I'm trying to make it as easy as possible and make kind of restrictions so I have restrictions on some post types like if you upload an image that's you know a certain size if it's not at least let's say 600 pixels wide then it won't display because I don't want pixelated looking images on the site so even if somebody were to upload you know a really small image because they don't realize you know the quality of images and how that works on websites then there's some protection that that won't make the site look bad okay so some of the fields don't allow HTML strips it out so there's some protections in there like that so setting it up like this definitely makes it easier for people to enter content and then it also gives me a lot of control over how that contents displayed and it takes that control away from the WordPress editor which in this case we want because it would be very easy for someone who didn't didn't really know anything about websites to kind of make it look make it look bad I mean not that they would mean to but it would be easy you know if they could just go in and put a bunch HTML and change the theme and everything like you normally could do on a wordpress site that wouldn't be great so let's see there's some questions I'm going to come back to the questions in the live chat so I see there's some discussion going on there but I want to get to this I'll come back at the end and kind of join in the discussion a bit let me show you now now that we've seen the custom photo types what it's going to look like I'm going to show you how we make them I know I've briefly went through this maybe last week at some point I just kind of showed it now we're actually going to make some things with this and then we're going to add the fields to it and then we're going to see what it looks like when it comes in the API so right here I've just been making a list I've been going through the site and making a list of all the sections that right now you can't edit through WordPress that need to be added I have two ideas for how to do this some of the sections would probably work well if I just make them a page because if it's a section that won't be repeated so for instance like this section here is going to be an intro section I always want this section to just be about a paragraph okay so I can make this section just be a page and not even necessarily a custom post type it would just be a page with the name resources intro okay we could give it that name and then I could pull that page based on the the slug which is and I kind of like a string version of an ID WordPress gives every page and post an ID that's a number but then they also give it a slug which is always a string that is a unique identifier so in this case I would search for this name of this page okay so I'm going to do that I'm not going to do the pages that right now because I don't have to custom code those so that's not as nice a thing to do on on the video but for sections they're going to repeat so like in is it events now sorry courses okay so courses some of these sections will be static pretty much and so we could just make them a page but some of them like these are basically the same thing repeated over and over again right so it's just just text I did have a request to add some images in here but I'm not 100% sure how I'm going to change how this looks to fit with that so so that's that's coming but for now at least these are all just going to be repetitive sections so that's perfect candidate for a custom post site so that we can set okay I you know use we just need a title and then we need text just very simple now some of these like have a little bit of more custom formatting like this has you know this quote here so there are going to be some that if somebody knows what they're doing they could throw some HTML in here and it could work I'll have to make sure that I have the style set properly on on this end for it to work but you know that's so I want to leave this whatever we make as the input for this we want to make it so that hTML is able to be put in so we'll make that like a WYSIWYG editor so I think this is a good candidate to do first so let's do that and I've already had it to the list I think I'm just going to call it ministry tracks so I see I know there's some stuff going on in the live chat so I will get to it I just want to kind of push ahead with us now so that I can try to keep to keep this to about an hour total for the live stream so what I'm going to do basically this makes a new custom post type this this portion here is basically thing that you need to change there's one portion at the bottom which basically initializes everything okay so this you only need to add one time this section down here I'm just going to move down so we're very clear that this is a new section and these are custom taxonomies I'm not going to do custom taxonomies today I don't think I need these for anything on the site at this point so as long as you add this one time at the bottom here to admit everything you can just put you know all of your post types in one big one big object I guess that's what I'm not sure what this isn't PHP is okay so one big function so this is greater create new type function so yeah all right so it all has to go in that function sorry I'm just like trying to make sure that I know what's going on in the PHP and can explain it as best I can I am NOT a PHP developer so if you know more about PHP than I do which is likely just bear with me here I know enough PHP to make things change in WordPress and upload files on a small website that's about it so I'm going to take this I just copied this and I'm going to paste it below and I'm going to do some kind of best editing here so you see basically in this point I'll go through them all oops I don't wanna so some of these are going to be singular in some plural so what I found is it's easiest to just select the singular and then the S on the end will come in so if you shoot I don't have this in a repo maybe I'll make like a gist or something and make this available in case you want to add this to WordPress and make your own post type so I'll make a note of that right now and make that available if you want because I imagine you'd be super hard to try to like look at this on the video and type it all out as I'm moving it around okay I may already have this somewhere and get up and just to forgotten about it but in case I don't know add it and then I'll add a link in this video so basically at this point I'm just going to type in the name that I want for this ministry tracks whoops okay so now I'll go through this so we're giving it the official name right ministry tracks these names up here these are going to be the ones that what you usually see displayed in the admin panel that's why I like you know this this looks like normal text okay it's not you know we're not doing like camel casing or anything like that because we want this to display you know in a manner that's intelligible to people who don't know anything about code in the admin side so this is the singular name and this is let me bring this over here so I can it also be easier if I give you like a side by side to show you what these mean okay so the name I need to get this big enough there we go all right so your name is going to display here right your ad new all right it's gonna see like ad new whatever you want to say here so you could change this if you wanted you don't have to keep the defaults all right when you go to you know edit the item do this see you get the idea of all these are going to show up somewhere in the admin panel now down here these are going to be the names that like you'll use when you make a request to the API or if you are going to do other things like make another PHP plugin to do something else or even if you're making a traditional WordPress site and you're going to render these in PHP templates and things these are what you'll use to reference that so we just need to change ministry and do I do I don't remember if I usually do hyphens or underscores or camelcase let's see what I did here okay I did a great I'm not sure what's the convention in PHP is it usually underscores or said hyphens I see some underscores here at this point it's I've already done it differently so I don't really want to change it because then I'll have to change code in other places but just though this may not be the conventional way to do it in PHP just in terms of style so this is actually you know this is registering the post type we were giving it the options here okay so these options some of these it just depends on what you want to do so you might not need all of these but they're pretty some of them are pretty like self explanatory other ones so you might want to check out the documentation there's so much documentation for WordPress stuff so you'll be able to find exactly how to do this you know has archived true right this this means is this post type going to have that archive function if you see like on a lot of blogs you can go back the archive to like you know go back to the post from October 2016 right so do we want it to do that yes we want to do that I don't really know if I'll use that function but in case I do I'm just adding that is this public okay so you can have post types that aren't meant to be public they just you know you're tracking data in the admin panel you don't want people to see it you got to be logged in and stuff so we want this to be public and then we say supports and these are going to be the fields in here so I have actually taken these out for this post type but normally let me show you a post so by default this is kind of the fields that you have I actually added some up here but by default you'd have write your title so that's what this is talking about you have your editor here you have and decide I may have disabled excerpt so excerpt is just a smaller text input area where you could put in a custom excerpt for your post otherwise I think usually it's set to just take like the first so many characters and use that if you don't set it and then the the thumbnail so you can set you can add or take away these you know whatever you want it to have I think some of these have are probably like mandatory like I think every post has to have a title so you may not be able to take all of this out but you can certainly you know add things and but I have a kind of an easier way to add and take away things so I usually don't mess with this part in the PHP exclude from search false capability type so this is the type of supposed so we're going to rewrite the slug right so to ministry tracks and we're going to this is the important thing for the rest api do we want this to show up and be accessible from the rest api yes and do we want this to show in the menu yes I'm pretty sure that I it's been a long time since I mess with this to check it but I'm pretty sure this is like show in the in the admin menu so like here in the menu so yes we obviously want it to be here so that's that's it that's all it takes to do a custom post type so I'm going to save this unfortunately I am not able to get into the server right now so I was hoping that I could just kind of edit this like not that this would be a great idea but I was going to kind of just cowboy code this and edit it live since it's like it's really basic there's very little chance of me breaking anything since its it's just a really repetitive task copy and paste so normally you wouldn't want to edit things live but in any case I'm actually going to have to copy and paste this and then add this in so if you've never added a plugin to WordPress kind of the the weird way to do it is I actually go into the plugins section and I find my plugin which is here and you can edit it now I think you have to be an administrator so not every user can do this which is a good thing so all those people who I talked about that are going to be editing this then won't be able to do this so if you're making WordPress site for client definitely block stuff like this out for them so they can't come in and mess with these because they can definitely break your site so I'm just going to paste in everything that we did which this like I can't stand like having to copy and paste stuff when I'm working on a thing but Moe whoa we will check here and look now we have ministry tracks so if we go here we can add a ministry track right now I haven't set any of the stuff that we need I may not actually have to set anything custom here because we if you see the site what do we need here we need a title and we just need content here that's all we need for right now at some point later on we might need to add an image somewhere but by default this comes with a featured image so we can just use that but for right now I don't want there to be an excerpt and I don't want some of these other fields to show that that don't really make any sense in a headless CMS so there's going to be a field like if I were to put something here and save it there'd be a field to preview and it would show like what the URL is going to be I don't want that because if you click it it's not going to show this site it's going to show what it would look like if we're actually using a wordpress thing usually I don't even have a theme I I just block everything so if you try to go click that it will show you a blank page occasionally I have it redirect to the Rick Astley video for fun but but not on a important site not on client side so all right before I show you how to add custom fields and take them away I'm just going to check the live chat briefly just to make sure you that you all are with me let me scroll a little bit see what I've missed a few questions only answer a couple of them while I'm while I'm here there's not a lot and Ray I'm not sure I'm pronouncing that right it's a nd REI let me know how to pronounce that and I will make sure I pronounce it correctly it says why why would someone pay a developer to code on my website when he can make his own with WordPress that's a good point to be honest with you for some people in businesses it does make more sense for them to try to just do some type of simple site with WordPress or with you know there are there other things like what is it Squarespace or there are a lot of different services where you can go and just kind of drag and drop build a website honestly if you're just going to do a personal blog and you're not really making money off it then no don't pay a developer and I mean I'm I'm a developer so I mean I want I want people to pay me to make sites but realistically it doesn't make sense if you're very like a small business and you need something very simple let's say you're you're from an area where like for instance the area where I live is predominantly elderly so the population demographics here just like really really skewed in favor of people over 60 it's just the economy is really bad where I live so most of the people when they graduate from high school they leave because they can't find a job here so that's how it is so when I talk to people like a small local business and they want to know about a website my advice is sometimes you know you don't want me to do a website for you because you're not really going to make that money back that much you know your clients aren't your clients aren't going to be using your website that much if you have a presence on you know Google Maps that's what you need so I'm not Lee talking about really small clients they don't have a lot of money so I mean obviously bigger companies should have a website it should be a good website it should not just be you know regular defaults they should have somebody it's a professional working on it so that said for this site in particular it needed to be better I think I mentioned it earlier so this site needed to be more than just a normal WordPress site so that's why I did it like this and there's some other you know good answers as well that other people added to that uniqueness is one I mean yeah the if you have a unique site that's well done it definitely just adds at least in my mind if I go to somebody's site a company site if it's just basic WordPress site I don't think badly of them but if I go somewhere and they have a site that's like wow how did they do this site you know and I want to inspect the code and see this is really cool for me like it's just impressive I'm impressed with a company that takes the puts the thought into a site and has put the resources into doing something like that so not everybody's probably like that but it makes a big impact on me you know your site I mean consider your website like the online home of your business the online location so for some companies they could do with just a generic looking you know building to do their business in right but for some businesses they want to stand out they want to have nice architecture nice decorations right that that's kind of the difference is between you know I just have a little shop that looks like all the other little shops on the street or I have a place that people look at under like wow you know they walk in and it just attracts people because of how nice it is that's kind of the difference and if you want that you need to hire an architect that's you know that knows what they're doing and as you know some creative ability and an interior designer you know a decorator so hopefully that answered your question I probably spent too much time on that so sorry if I kind of over answered that let's see so I'm just I'm just getting through I'm almost to the end here of what's on the live chat all right so here's requested aft derp says is it better to have a main parent component and render that to the Dom or is it just the same to have many parents all separately rendered to the Dom competitor that's a nono 70 suppose I'm not like a hundred percent sure how to answer the question um let me just show you I haven't showed you any of the react stuff yet so let me just briefly kind of show you how a page works and it doesn't have to work like this this is kind of how things work in next when you're using next to build react stuff like this is my index so within this index file and I like that maybe I'm not really answering your question here but I'll give it a shot you know within my index this is actually it's not a good example because I'm not pulling in anything any other components really let's go to resources that's a better example so I'm importing all these other components these child components and I'm pulling them in so you know the sticky nav components here the title components here all these all the cards that I have on the page were just iterating over this data and then adding these cards to the page and that's a separate component so that's that's how I've been doing things I'm sure there are other ways to do things hopefully that clarified a little bit let me know if it didn't and I'll try later on maybe to give you a better explanation I had asked a few minutes ago about the different like using the or the underscore for PHP and it seems like the underscore was kind of the way I should have gone and Jake says the underscore is the way to go but then you have an underscore in the URL and you don't want that so actually now that you that I remember that is the reason that is the reason why I did it like this and not on this site but on like months ago when I first started working with this I had used underscore and then it I didn't like then I ended up having to use underscores later on in other places and I didn't want to use underscores everywhere so that's why I did go with the so thank you Thank You Jay reminded me of that and the Patrick says rickrolling clients priceless yeah it is pretty funny I actually got my I think I got my boss with that before um yeah it's funny but yeah I normally I don't do that for client sites but I think I may still have some WordPress installs where if you try to go to like the admin page you get rickrolled because I've changed the I change the URL for the login for the admin just to mess with somebody who might be trying to like get into my site and they're not supposed to be in there alright so let's get to I don't want to get completely off track here where we're going here we go let me show you how we're going to customize this for editing so I have a plugin called advanced custom fields and it gives me this extra menu item there's a pro version of advanced custom fields but there's a free version in this case the free version does everything that I needed to do so it's fine I have used the pro version in other sites and it has some functionality that if you need it it definitely saves you time it's worth the money I think it was like 25 dollars per site where you could pay $100 and use it on as many sites as you wanted I think it was in Australian dollars too so I'm not sure what that what that came out to and US dollars I think it ended up being cheaper in US dollars but at least at the time so let's go into we're going to add new and you get title let's go to ministry tracks info um I will say this you everything I'm about to do with this plugin you can do in PHP and just code it yourself I found that that was kind of would take too much time for me just because of my lack of experience with PHP if you're good with PHP give it a shot and that's one less plugin you have to worry about but I kind of this is nice this this works it's free it's well maintained plugin it consistently updated so I definitely recommend it and I get no I'm not sponsored by this plugin so this is an honest recommendation I get nothing for that so what we're going to do here is want to say when the post type equals alright so when it equals ministry track okay then all this stuff that we're about to do will apply okay so we're going to apply it to just that one and we have some options as to where this is going to display it's not really a big deal it's your preference usually if the field is like really important I don't want people to miss it I put it high right after the title but you can put anywhere you want this like display style is um totally up to you in terms of your preferences I found that this the seamless kind of looks cooler but the standard fits in better with WordPress so it's like it looks more like it's supposed to be there and then here's a place the place where we can actually hide a lot of stuff that we don't need so I'm just going to hide everything for now because we're only going to show a few things so we don't want the permalink as I said because that'll take you it'll take them to the wrong place it'll be misleading we do want the content editor this post I don't always add this and what we want that we don't want the excerpt we don't want any of the normal custom fields because we're going to add our own custom fields here we don't want discussion comments because we're not going to have people be commenting on this custom post type we do want revisions so that they could go back and see what's been changed we do want the slug in case I need to double check what the slug is you know if I'm trying to troubleshoot something we're going to keep the author and that way people can see who's worked on that post before we don't need format because that has to do with the layout of a WordPress theme and we're not using the WordPress theme we're going to keep featured image because at some point I think we're going to add images to that section so I'm just going to leave it in there for now even though right now if you put an image in there it wouldn't display at all on our site in fact we haven't linked this up to our site at all so it has it is actually not going to display depending on we're not going to have time in this stream but maybe in a future stream we can link this up I know I've already showed how to do that in a previous stream but maybe it would be cool to do have like the whole thing in order now we'll see let me know if you're interested in that we are not going to add any categories or tags at this point we could always add it in later but I don't really see any need for this because of what we're going to be using this for we don't need that if this were more like a blog style thing we would leave these and we don't need the Trackbacks so we've got rid of a lot of the stuff on the page if I wanted to do a custom field which I don't need for this one but let's just say I go here to add a field I can add a label so I'm just going to do some nonsense here it gives it this field name this is the name of the field that will show up in the in the JSON so let me show you a guy here so like anything that you put here will show up under this çf section in your JSON and this is the name so you'll need to use this name in your API call and then no not in the API code you'll need to use this name when you're rendering out the contents of this so you can choose a field type to a lot of different things you can choose from and then if you get the pro version there's even more you can have some instructions so this is really important if you're making it for clients you know really spell out exactly what you want in that field and how it how you want it to be formatted you can make it required or not you can give it a default value placeholder text right so you can even said okay where do I want this this text to go so it really kind of nitpicky things as to how you want to align this but you know might be important this I almost always choose no formatting unless there's some really good reason why I want people to be able to use HTML in in whatever text area that is okay so normally not I don't use that and occasionally you don't want to character limit so for these I don't need a character limit because if you remember on the page we're just showing and hiding them so it's really not going to be a big deal to have them be super long because they won't be immediately displayed to the user won't make the page really long so we're not going to have a character limit there but I would recommend this for for things that you don't want to make super long because it would look bad put the character limit in there and then usually people who don't know about websites have a tendency to write way too much text and in general on a website you want less text you know unless you're writing a blog post or something then that's understandable but you know if it's on like your home page you to you know just skip out people never read all the text in any way so try to keep it short and to the point so that's basically it I would add this field and I don't really want to keep it but I'll just add it just for demonstration purposes and I'm going to publish this now when I go back up here to ministry tracks and I go to add new we can see it looks a bit different we don't have the excerpt anymore actually there's no option to get rid of these sharing buttons I am this is not going to hurt anything but actually if I can figure out how to get rid of this I may as well because it's kind of pointless in them I just be distracting so basically we have our all we have is just what we wanted to include our title our content our main content editor and then here's our field so we added one field here and then we just added another one in dis left at blank but that's where they would go like if we wanted to we could have this display up here but that's it you can see it just it looks like it's meant to be there if blends in really well with everything and that's where it added so at this point what I would do to kind of complete this process for this post type is I would go in here and basically at this point I would probably copy and paste or I would probably have somebody else do it because that's a little bit of kind of a waste of my time to just copy and paste so if I had maybe like a student worker who needed to get some hours in and maybe I would have them copy and paste this into here fill out all the tracks once I have the data in there then I would go in and pull this in so just like I'm doing here with these resources where I get I can make a call to the API here with fetch and then I get that data back I showed you what the JSON looks like and then I use that data down here to populate the page so that's what I would do for the the page the courses page with the ministry checks exactly like that so you can go and get up right now and check out this code and just kind of see what the next step would be just by checking out one of the pages where I'm actually importing data where you see this get initial props at the top of the component so that's it so I've come in it just slightly over an hours so we kind of hit our goal today of being about an hour I am going to keep going for a couple more minutes just to answer your questions so if you were only here for the code you can stop watching now and thanks for watching but if you do have a few more minutes to stick around for some questions go ahead and put your questions in the live chat and I will try to answer as many as I can as best I can and if your if you don't want to put your question in the live chat if you're a little nervous about that you can put it in a direct message to me on Twitter my Twitter a link to my Twitter account is in the description for this video or if you can't stick around for the answer you can put the question in the comments to this video and I will get to it I do read all your comments and everything that everyone sends me I read it all sometimes it takes me a few days to get to it but I do read it all and I will respond alright so let me get to to some of this live chat let's see there's not a whole lot here so the question answer session might be pretty short today which that's fine because I so some of you evidently are like staying up really late to watch this because your time zones are a lot different than my time zone so I appreciate that that you know you you like the screen enough to to stay up like that but I don't want to keep you up too late every night so I'll try to be shorter than normal let's see I'm going through I'm trying to find a question here that I haven't already addressed so haven't found very much yet okay Sebastian asked can't you redirect WP cat attack etics com2 the real site yeah so I thought of that before so just for some context here I had said before that on the WordPress select normally when you do something in WordPress and you save a post there'll be a link here where you check out your post or preview so there's a preview button you preview it with the way I've set it up here if you click this preview it's going to take you not to the site that you should go to not to catechetical comm but it's going to try to take you to the site that would be there if we were using the wordpress template and I usually just completely disable the template so it'll basically take you to a blank page but you know at best it's just you know it's misleading for people try to click that and they think oh wow this isn't what it's supposed to look like or they think hey this site is broken what happened so I just take that out I mean I I can take out the preview button if I really wanted to get into it into editing but I'm not super worried about that right now Sebastian is saying couldn't you just make all that redirect to the right place on the on the actual catechetical home site and I think that's probably possible and I'd like to do that there's actually another site that I did I can't show you it's a it's like an internal web site and my my bosses want it to be they want it to stay private it's basically just an internal bulletin realistically like 90% or more of the content there's no reason why I couldn't be public and it probably is public elsewhere but I'm not allowed to show it but I will say that the person in my department who has two input content for that has requested before that that exact feature of either that she can preview what it's going to look like so I'm working on a way to do that I would like it to be able to for there to be a feature where she can upload things and be able to preview it and see it on a page on the site I didn't actually build it with react I made like a single page app but I did it in like jQuery which that's that site was kind of small enough that it wasn't too much of a mess but I wouldn't want to do that again that was before I was confident enough with react to build it so I'd like to make a set page the only she would be able to see that she would be able to preview because right now if she puts something in it you know it's live so like it may only be live for a second but she has to make it live to see what it's really going to look like which I mean that's not really a good option so I mean I I definitely should have in hindsight I should have made that so that you there was some type of preview feature built in but it generally works there's not really a lot of leeway with how you can enter the content for that site but I'm definitely working on that and if I get a solution to it maybe I'll show you like on a demo site since I can't show you the actual site because that seems like it would be valuable if you're trying to have a similar set up to this all right okay so daftar have said that data answers question see that that question was about I almost called you a he I'm not sure if you he or she is sorry about that so dafter asked a question about how you set up how you render the components and things and react so I'm glad that that they'd answer your question authority Thor is here is that he nearly missed it again sorry you're missing it is it I don't I don't know why you're missing it is it a weird like it's it's usually a 2 p.m. Eastern Time so for some reason it seems like you're coming in an hour late is that like you just can't make it earlier or what how to make one too many relationship between custom posts so Andrew asks how to make one of many relationship between custom posts Andrew I'm not exactly sure what you're asking if you're still watching could you explain a little bit more because I'd like to answer your question but I don't I don't think I understand it well enough right now to give you a good answer Thor says it's 900 p.m. here should not really a problem alright so this is 9 p.m. there tomorrow watch it start watching at 8 p.m. there and then you will be here on time if you can also for those of you who are watching really late all the time there may be some times where I have to do an earlier stream so that might be more convenient for you I'm thinking like they're definitely going to be some Monday's where I'll have meetings at 1 that will probably go really long so I'll probably have to switch it up so far I've been able to skip some of those meetings because it wasn't really relevant for me but I think I'm going to have to start going to a few of them so just heads up on that so there will be a little change in time but that might be good for some people maybe some some people that can't you only watch live may be able to Jake says nice job Jesse I think you cleared some concepts that took me quite some time to figure out on my own awesome I'm glad I could be of some assistance to you Jake Roland says today is stark contrast to yesterday's it's just 1235 a.m. we went to 210 a.m. yesterday yeah yesterday was super long I was I was actually super exhausted I remember yesterday I said I had to go to the store and pick up some stuff I was so exhausted after the livestream yesterday that I didn't I went home and just relaxed because I couldn't I couldn't even make it I was super hungry and tired and I thought I'm not going to try to go to the store now I'll probably buy everything and because I'm so hungry and tired let's see Thor asks why are you using WordPress oh ok sorry there's one before that so smilers asked what application is it I'm not sure what you're referring to I think I'm missing something so smile is a type of redactors you okay what type / is using for code you mean that code editor uh it's if you mean my code editor I'm using Adam if you mean like the framework I'm using react on the on the frontend side of things to render everything and then I'm using WordPress to manage the content but I'm not using the template system that WordPress has so hopefully that answers your question let me know if it didn't so Thor says why are you using WordPress for this purpose is there nothing better for this for example a simple Django application or something like this the two main reasons why I'm using WordPress for this is number one because a lot of people who have no experience at all with code are going to be editing this and there's going to be a high turnover rate for people who are editing this so they need to be able to be trained very quickly and use this so WordPress is very user friendly in that way the second reason is because this site was a really tough schedule I didn't really have time to learn anything and I don't know something like Django I do I have done this exact thing with WordPress in the past so I knew that I could get it done on time if I did it this way so that's generally not a great idea to use something just because hey I know how to do it I'm just going to keep doing it this way but in this case it actually did work out well for the project so if on future projects if I have more time and it would work out better I'm definitely open to using something other than WordPress for content management actually let me know in the live chat or in the comments what you would recommend using if I if we weren't using WordPress what should have been used what do you think and maybe if I get some time I'll check out your suggestions and see because I'm I'm certainly open WordPress is a little bit of a resource hog it can be on the server so something more lightweight as long as it's still user friendly for for people who don't know about code I would definitely be open to using the other thing is WordPress has a huge user base and there's a lot of great documentation on it so that's really helpful for me at times when I need to do some custom things with it hooligan soft says hey hey what's up thanks for watching door says testing and production is great yeah I don't have a copy of the WordPress install either locally or on another server I'm thinking about getting one it's probably a good idea to get one I probably should do it but I just don't have a setup right now to be honest with you I'm a little bit intimidating with the idea of like how do I sync up the database do I have two separate databases and try to keep them in sync do I pull from the same database but if I do that is that really like a decent development environment you know because so whatever I don't know how to do that there is somebody else Brian works with me here and he has worked more with stuff like this and using WordPress and databases so I'm gonna maybe talk to him a little bit about that and see what he recommends in terms of having a like a testing environment or test you know a testing development server and if you all have any input on that I would appreciate it as well because I probably should have it you know in general you should never be editing a site live if if you don't have to if it's not an emergency hooligan soft says can you make tutorials from making WordPress theme from scratch um that would be really cool unfortunately I don't think I could make a good tutorial on making a wordpress theme from scratch because to do a theme from scratch you have to have some knowledge of PHP at least enough to do the WordPress PHP thing and I'm not confident in my skills to do that so I do know how to do a lot of customization from scratch I have I have honestly I have built a really basic theme from scratch before but that was a long time ago so I don't think I could do it justice I wouldn't feel comfortable putting out a tutorial like that I mean you all know I mean I attempt a lot of things that where I don't really know what I'm doing so I'm not opposed to doing that but to actually do like a from beginning to end tutorial on something I would want to be more knowledge of also but if anyone else knows of a good tutorial to make a theme from scratch please you know let let us know in the live chat or in the comments so that it can be a nice resource for whoever needs to do that rohan says i don't know how WP handles content but you can have an internal temp entry and use preview to generate page from that ok that's interesting I will have to keep that in mind and maybe look look up some more on that I'm just thinking about that for a second ok thank you for that suggestion andrew says is front end served by wordpress or some node app it's a node it's a node app so Andrew I'm using on a set to WordPress lives on one digitalocean droplet and then on another droplet we're really to other droplets I have clones of a node app it's react that actually renders all the data that it's getting from WordPress through the WordPress API and there's there's a load balancer that your shifts traffic between those two copies of the the node app another thing that I didn't mention when I was talking about WordPress that I'll mention briefly I just remembered the cool thing about using the WordPress API for this is the same content that you put into WordPress you can use for your website you could potentially add a theme on to this and have a traditional WordPress site if you wanted to there's nothing stopping you from doing that as well you can pull the data into anything that can get anything that can use an API a REST API and get in can process JSON data so and any app probably some Internet of Things stuff I've actually had an idea to make an Alexa skill for the Amazon echo that would pull data from the WordPress API and like read you the blog posts so I don't know if somebody's already done that and you know about it let me know and then maybe I won't do it because it's been done already but if it hasn't been done I'd like to do it and or if you want to take my idea and do it first just let me know because I think be cool just to use I won't be mad if you steal my idea but that's kind of cool that you could use it in a lot of different places so they'd all lives in one place and it's all easily editable and like imagine like if you wanted to keep everything in your organization all sync together in terms of the you know let's say you have like a business and you wanted like your times that you're open or even like on let's say your restaurant you change your menu frequently well you change your menu here in one place and it automatically syncs to you know you're at let's say you had an app I know this would be weird for a restaurant to have an app to and an Alexa skill and all this and now all of a sudden all the data is updated instantly everywhere there's some definitely some value in that and can save whoever's editing your content it saves them a lot of time all right let me continue on I'm nearly at the end here the live chat so where the stream is getting longer and in spite of my my efforts to make it shorter today it keeps going longer so sorry about that I just you know I don't want to leave you all hanging if you have questions so I definitely let's say this I want to try to cut it off at an hour and a half so that'll be in ten minutes we'll cut it off even if I haven't gotten through everything and then maybe I'll just try to answer your questions like maybe at the beginning of the next stream like tomorrow stream if I don't get to them all let's see Thoris will try it's not a time problem where something is just probably remembering it she probably set up reminder event or something okay all right cool Thor that's the Souris talking that's we were talking about that the time that he was kind of late getting in here to watch it so it's just a remembering thing so cool if you um if you're not already subscribed to the free code can't channel I think though if you have your notifications turned on and you subscribe I think they will alert you so you'll get like if you have the YouTube app it will alert on your phone you're going to notification or it can do like desktop notifications as well so that might be helpful to you I also post on Twitter usually like beforehand so that could be another reminder Andrew says custom post author custom post book add books to author okay so Andrews clarified its earlier question about how to make relationships between custom posts so yeah this is possible let me think for a second because I'm I have worked with this sort of thing before it's been a long time so let me let me just think for a second to make sure I I remember what's going on okay so here's what you can do um I do I believe in WordPress you can make so you would have the two custom posts write author and book that books to author how did I do this before you know what I think I didn't solve it in the best way so I wanted to be able to add books to author and Link it but I think what I ended up doing instead was did I make a taxonomy I may have made a taxonomy or some so I don't think I solved it correctly but I think it's possible I just don't I don't know how I can't remember exactly how I did a similar thing so I don't want to give you an answer so sorry I can't give you a good answer on that but I can tell you that I'm I'm almost positive that it's possible because I did look into it before I just I either couldn't get it working or it didn't seem like I needed it that much that it was worth the time but I I mean that's that's definitely something that comes up so I'm sure the answers is out there Jake says luca node who's pulling data from workforce api ok awesome so jake had already answered the question so sorry I should have read ahead and then I wouldn't have had to answer that John says I'm late for any fix all right sorry John you can watch the replay the replay will be oh man so we had a couple people who were late so the replay will be available in like a minute after I end this stream so I mean if you want to participate in the questions and stuff just add them in the comments below the video andrew says we're press gives you fast bootstrapper backend and already has json api enabled with all endpoints yes excellent that's that's a great point yeah you you don't have to build any of that it just it comes it's just there and if you're using like managed hosting or you know like like GoDaddy or something like that they're like you know regular shared hosting account there's usually a oneclick install for WordPress and it takes five minutes so in five minutes you have a REST API you know that's that's really easy so I'm sure they're probably better ways to build an eight but if you don't know how to do that I don't have time to mess with that then I mean you can't beat that that's that's just simple really simple Thor says ok thanks for answering never heard people using WordPress for this purpose just wondering yeah it's actually it's kind of new or the WordPress API has been around for a couple of years but it's been in like beta stage for a while it's only within the last year I think that it's it's like officially part of WordPress core used to be you had to get a separate plugin and enable it and stuff so for a while there it was recommended not to use it on production sites I did still use it anyway because in my experience like it worked there were very few breaking changes that ever occurred and if it did happen it was well documented so I never had a problem with it but it's it's only recently that it's I think like at a stable enough point that a lot of people are starting to use it Andrew says yes is a good practice to keep staging in production even local in sync yeah that's the that's the goal that's what I should have set up so I pretty much have that for the node um a part of this but just not for the WordPress part Andrew says this is how WordPress that WordPress takes templates in theme I'm not sure what that was in response to Andrew so I don't remember I mean what I was talking about at that point so sorry Jordan says what size drop list ease actually so this is really cool um Oh Roland says the stream keeps dropping I haven't been watching the the stream stats oh I didn't see sorry about that actually when it goes that's weird okay sorry it was dropping right now it seems it's it's holding I'm like over 5,000 kilobits per second so it should be good right now so sorry about the drop I mean obviously I don't really have control over that can action but I usually have a really good connection at work so Jordan the droplet size I'm using fivedollar droplets for everything so the to clone like no droplets are both fivedollar droplets and then WordPress's on a five dollar droplet usually it's recommended not to go with the $5 for WordPress but because I'm using it in this way just the headless part of WordPress and it's not having to do any like rendering of templates at all I've found that I can get away with putting WordPress on a fivedollar droplet and it's still really fast and it holds up I definitely be a point where if I get too much traffic I would have to upgrade it but that's actually been really nice that I'm able to to run it on a fivedollar droplet I'm also going to take advantage of once once all the post types and everything really get bailed out I'm going to turn on caching for the API and that's going to decrease the load on WordPress even further and then I do have caching set within node at the server level and then there's also caching going on on the client side with the serviceworker so there are three levels of caching if I have time I may even route this through CloudFlare and so there will essentially be four levels of caching going on so once if a request even got all the way back to WordPress it would be somewhat rare so it'll allow me it will allow me to run these on very cheap droplets because I'm kind of protecting them from the brunt of all the traffic that you would normally have on a wordpress site so so for right now that works I think is pretty cool that I can run it on lower droplets I mean not that I need to I'm sure you know for this project there was there was a budget that was large enough that I could have done a larger droplet but there's really no reason to the site is running very quickly and at least for me from from my testing it's been running very quick and the API calls are coming back you know very very fast you know within milliseconds let's see Jonathan says there's a PHP myadmin on your host server where WordPress is hosted this gives you full capabilities to run sequel off the database on the backend as well yeah actually I don't have PHP myadmin installed when I run WordPress on digitalocean so I'm not sure I actually had my colleague Brian set up the WordPress instance so he may have installed PHP myadmin or something like that I'll have to ask him about it but um when I've done installs of WordPress on digital ocean I haven't installed anything and if I do need to mess with sequel I've just done it from the command line and that's worked for me if you use a host like for some sites I do have on GoDaddy and I use SiteGround for some sites too those usually come with like cPanel and PHP myadmin so that makes it a lot easier if you have access to PHP myadmin and can use it use that it's way easier than the command line for that normally I do like the command line but for for doing database stuff I don't like it as much all right last andrew says last question for me do you sync your containers databases when using load balancing thanks so so no actually so the containers so the node apps have no databases and those two containers are where the load gets balanced between the API calls all go to just one instance of WordPress so there doesn't need to be any load balancing to there because you know obviously there's just one and that's where the database sits so so no I don't have to deal with syncing that to any of the you know for load balancing purposes okay someone asks and I can't pronounce this because it's in Russian says who is from Russia or who is speaking on Russian let's study together so I don't speak Russian if anybody else speaks Russian then you know get together maybe you guys can study together and you says better use my sequel workbench app to connect to database instead of PHP myadmin which has load on your server all right good to know I'll have to check that up Andrew knows Russian awesome okay and that's the end of the live chat did I make it um two minutes over what I wanted to be so almost made it lost track of time there at the end so still have but we have 32 viewers still even after all that time so a little bit lower than normal but it's been a long stream okay somebody joining us just now hey how's it going thanks for watching so I'll see tomorrow I should be I don't think I have any meetings or anything so it should be same time 200 p.m. Eastern Time thanks for watching I and feel free to ask me any questions and I appreciate all the the great interaction we've had in the live chat today and anyway for the for all the people that thumbs down this I had one earlier please let me know why you thumbs down it I won't be upset with you I just want to make it better so thanks for watching have a great day and I will see you tomorrow
