00:00 - hey everybody welcome back to css3 in 30
00:02 - days today is day 15 and we're going to
00:03 - be coding up a sticky sidebar what is a
00:06 - sticky sidebar and why would you use it
00:08 - well a sticky sidebar is essentially
00:10 - just a sidebar that sticks to the side
00:12 - of the page as you scroll
00:14 - so that the content in that sidebar is
00:16 - remains always visible
00:19 - and the reason why you'd want to do that
00:21 - is maybe you have an opt-in or a lead
00:23 - magnet a subscription form a call to
00:26 - action
00:27 - maybe an order purchase maybe you have a
00:29 - checkout and the sidebar has the
00:32 - checkout details with the price and the
00:34 - taxes and so on and as you're scrolling
00:36 - down that long page that sidebar remains
00:39 - in view so that you can always see
00:42 - important details maybe even the
00:43 - checkout button something like that
00:45 - there's some there are a few ideas uh to
00:47 - use the sticky sidebar so jump over here
00:48 - in my browser and let's see what that
00:50 - looks like here we simply have a info
00:53 - page we're doing that info page student
00:55 - page and final page convention that
00:57 - we've been doing uh a couple times and
01:00 - essentially this is just the
01:01 - instructions with two buttons one takes
01:03 - you to the student version which you're
01:04 - gonna be playing around with and the
01:06 - final version which you can use for
01:07 - reference let's go ahead and check out
01:08 - the final version just to see what's
01:10 - going on here is the layout we've got a
01:12 - left side left content with long
01:15 - filler text
01:17 - and the sidebar as you can see remains
01:19 - in view
01:21 - and that's kind of interesting
01:24 - you can position it any way you really
01:26 - want and if you wanted to use javascript
01:27 - or you wanted to get even crazier you
01:29 - can wait until you scroll down until
01:32 - this look this part of the page
01:35 - and then you have the sticky sidebar
01:37 - start moving but for this case we're
01:38 - just going to use css and keep it simple
01:41 - and just have that sidebar just remain
01:43 - in its position
01:45 - and it is quite easy it shouldn't take
01:47 - us very long at all here's a student
01:49 - version we haven't done any styles here
01:51 - in terms of laying out the sidebar
01:53 - sidebar is in fact down here with no
01:55 - styles whatsoever and it looks really
01:56 - bad so let's jump over to our code
01:58 - editor make sure you download the sticky
02:00 - sidebar number 15 course files and i'll
02:03 - wait here just a moment for you to go
02:05 - ahead and do that
02:08 - [Music]
02:29 - good that should be enough time here in
02:31 - the code editor i'm going to show you
02:32 - what the the code looks like real quick
02:35 - and then we're going to get started so
02:36 - the index file is simply that info page
02:38 - that has the information uh with the
02:40 - instructions you really don't need to
02:41 - concern yourself with it it is the
02:43 - student.html and the final.html are
02:46 - those are the html files that you need
02:47 - to concern yourself with i'll show you
02:48 - that in a sec sandbox.css is where
02:51 - you're going to style things up as usual
02:53 - final.css is where all of the styles are
02:55 - for you to reference just in case you
02:57 - need a little bit of help
02:59 - so student.html looks like this we have
03:01 - a div with the class of sticky sidebar
03:03 - lesson we're going to use that class in
03:05 - a moment it wraps everything including
03:08 - the sandbox div
03:10 - which is the left content and the sticky
03:12 - sidebar div which is the sticky sidebar
03:14 - on the right those are the two
03:16 - two or three elements that you need to
03:18 - know and concern yourself with so jump
03:20 - over into the sandbox.css and let's get
03:23 - ourselves coden coden coding let's get
03:27 - coding
03:28 - let's code
03:30 - sticky
03:31 - sidebar
03:33 - dash lesson sticky dash sidewire dash
03:36 - sticky shard bar luscious
03:38 - width eighty percent we're gonna say
03:40 - margin zero and auto that's just gonna
03:42 - make those things look a little bit like
03:44 - so there it is
03:46 - a little bit
03:47 - less wide then the reason we want to do
03:49 - that is we want to make some space for
03:52 - some things let's carry on
03:54 - sticky
03:55 - sidebar
03:56 - lesson
03:57 - after pseudo element after virtual last
04:01 - child after element whatever we want to
04:02 - call that thing the after
04:06 - display table
04:08 - content
04:09 - empty string clear both what is this
04:11 - everybody it is a clear fix
04:17 - clear fix okay uh and that's just simply
04:21 - to allow the footer to stay put rather
04:23 - than collapsing up when we start
04:24 - floating the next element which is the
04:27 - sticky sidebar lesson and then the
04:31 - sandbox we're going to style this one up
04:33 - it's going to be nice and simple we're
04:34 - going to give it a width 60 percent
04:38 - and then we're gonna we're gonna margin
04:40 - zero zero forty that is zero on the top
04:42 - zero on the left and right forty on the
04:44 - bottom just give it some space from the
04:46 - footer and we're gonna float that left
04:49 - so now if we save that and check it out
04:50 - footer stays put and the this content is
04:53 - over on the left at sixty percent width
04:55 - sticky sidebar is over on the right
04:57 - problem is the sticky sidebar doesn't
04:58 - look right so we're going to style it up
04:59 - real nice and pretty here so let's
05:02 - scroll down
05:03 - and do one last set of styles sticky
05:06 - sidebar coming for you sticky sidebar
05:09 - background we're gonna make it that pale
05:11 - blue color which is e7 ee f1
05:15 - padding 40 pixels 40 pixels 60 pixels
05:18 - that's 40 in the top 40 on the left and
05:19 - right 60 on the bottom
05:22 - and we're gonna go box sizing we're
05:24 - going to say border box what does border
05:25 - box do
05:27 - it essentially means that the padding
05:28 - that you add to the element doesn't add
05:30 - any width to the box itself it just
05:34 - maintains the the width that i determine
05:36 - and the padding stays on the inside
05:39 - by default when you add padding to a box
05:43 - it
05:44 - increases the width
05:45 - and that causes issues when you're doing
05:47 - math for floating and so on and so forth
05:49 - we want the box to say the same width
05:52 - that we determine and the padding on the
05:54 - inside if this makes any sense
05:57 - whatsoever
05:58 - to to to maintain the same width but the
06:00 - padding on the inside stays within there
06:02 - contained so that's what that does
06:04 - border radius
06:06 - two pixels a nice little subtle all the
06:08 - way around we're going to give it a box
06:10 - shadow and this is just going to be an
06:12 - offset 0 12 pixels 0 negative 6 pixels
06:16 - and then f
06:18 - a 9 0 3. all that's doing is that little
06:21 - 3d effect that offset pale blue shadow
06:24 - makes it look 3d you'll see in a sec
06:26 - here let's go check it out
06:28 - there it is it is over here on the right
06:31 - and it's got that two pixel border
06:33 - radius and then offset shadow
06:35 - but the problem with sticky sidebar is
06:37 - that there's no space in between the two
06:39 - it doesn't look very good and and that
06:41 - is a problem
06:43 - right there so let's go ahead
06:46 - and continue over here
06:48 - we're going to say position position
06:50 - fixed that's going to fix it in place
06:52 - but we got to tell it where to stay put
06:54 - 5 from the right
06:57 - the width will be 36 percent that's to
06:59 - give it a little bit of a gap between
07:00 - the sandbox
07:02 - because we don't want it to be the full
07:03 - width of its of what's left we want to
07:06 - give it some
07:07 - space from that sandbox i want to float
07:09 - that right
07:11 - save that
07:13 - come over here check out the student
07:14 - version
07:15 - sticky sidebar self-contained when i
07:18 - scroll down it stays put nice and in
07:21 - place
07:22 - and really
07:24 - that is it
07:26 - now i have a little challenge for you if
07:28 - you want to take this a bit further
07:29 - outside of the scope of this lesson but
07:31 - fully something that you should try
07:33 - is make this responsive currently it is
07:36 - not responsive so if i resize this we're
07:38 - just going to have a sticky sidebar that
07:40 - you know
07:41 - it doesn't look very good the text isn't
07:43 - right these these shouldn't be side by
07:45 - side on a mobile device they should be
07:47 - stacked or the sidebar should disappear
07:49 - or whatever it is that you feel
07:50 - necessary
07:52 - i want you to go ahead
07:53 - add some media queries here in your
07:55 - sandbox.css
07:56 - and stack these elements remove the
07:58 - floats remove the position fixed do
08:01 - whatever you feel is necessary to make
08:02 - this look right on mobile devices i
08:05 - suggest you do that as a little
08:07 - challenge
08:08 - see what you can come up with and i hope
08:10 - today's lesson was valuable to you today
08:13 - hope you have a few ideas running
08:15 - through your head of how you might want
08:16 - to use this in your own projects thanks
08:19 - for hanging out for a few minutes and
08:21 - i'll see you tomorrow in day number 16.

hey everybody welcome back to css3 in 30 days today is day 15 and we're going to be coding up a sticky sidebar what is a sticky sidebar and why would you use it well a sticky sidebar is essentially just a sidebar that sticks to the side of the page as you scroll so that the content in that sidebar is remains always visible and the reason why you'd want to do that is maybe you have an optin or a lead magnet a subscription form a call to action maybe an order purchase maybe you have a checkout and the sidebar has the checkout details with the price and the taxes and so on and as you're scrolling down that long page that sidebar remains in view so that you can always see important details maybe even the checkout button something like that there's some there are a few ideas uh to use the sticky sidebar so jump over here in my browser and let's see what that looks like here we simply have a info page we're doing that info page student page and final page convention that we've been doing uh a couple times and essentially this is just the instructions with two buttons one takes you to the student version which you're gonna be playing around with and the final version which you can use for reference let's go ahead and check out the final version just to see what's going on here is the layout we've got a left side left content with long filler text and the sidebar as you can see remains in view and that's kind of interesting you can position it any way you really want and if you wanted to use javascript or you wanted to get even crazier you can wait until you scroll down until this look this part of the page and then you have the sticky sidebar start moving but for this case we're just going to use css and keep it simple and just have that sidebar just remain in its position and it is quite easy it shouldn't take us very long at all here's a student version we haven't done any styles here in terms of laying out the sidebar sidebar is in fact down here with no styles whatsoever and it looks really bad so let's jump over to our code editor make sure you download the sticky sidebar number 15 course files and i'll wait here just a moment for you to go ahead and do that good that should be enough time here in the code editor i'm going to show you what the the code looks like real quick and then we're going to get started so the index file is simply that info page that has the information uh with the instructions you really don't need to concern yourself with it it is the student.html and the final.html are those are the html files that you need to concern yourself with i'll show you that in a sec sandbox.css is where you're going to style things up as usual final.css is where all of the styles are for you to reference just in case you need a little bit of help so student.html looks like this we have a div with the class of sticky sidebar lesson we're going to use that class in a moment it wraps everything including the sandbox div which is the left content and the sticky sidebar div which is the sticky sidebar on the right those are the two two or three elements that you need to know and concern yourself with so jump over into the sandbox.css and let's get ourselves coden coden coding let's get coding let's code sticky sidebar dash lesson sticky dash sidewire dash sticky shard bar luscious width eighty percent we're gonna say margin zero and auto that's just gonna make those things look a little bit like so there it is a little bit less wide then the reason we want to do that is we want to make some space for some things let's carry on sticky sidebar lesson after pseudo element after virtual last child after element whatever we want to call that thing the after display table content empty string clear both what is this everybody it is a clear fix clear fix okay uh and that's just simply to allow the footer to stay put rather than collapsing up when we start floating the next element which is the sticky sidebar lesson and then the sandbox we're going to style this one up it's going to be nice and simple we're going to give it a width 60 percent and then we're gonna we're gonna margin zero zero forty that is zero on the top zero on the left and right forty on the bottom just give it some space from the footer and we're gonna float that left so now if we save that and check it out footer stays put and the this content is over on the left at sixty percent width sticky sidebar is over on the right problem is the sticky sidebar doesn't look right so we're going to style it up real nice and pretty here so let's scroll down and do one last set of styles sticky sidebar coming for you sticky sidebar background we're gonna make it that pale blue color which is e7 ee f1 padding 40 pixels 40 pixels 60 pixels that's 40 in the top 40 on the left and right 60 on the bottom and we're gonna go box sizing we're going to say border box what does border box do it essentially means that the padding that you add to the element doesn't add any width to the box itself it just maintains the the width that i determine and the padding stays on the inside by default when you add padding to a box it increases the width and that causes issues when you're doing math for floating and so on and so forth we want the box to say the same width that we determine and the padding on the inside if this makes any sense whatsoever to to to maintain the same width but the padding on the inside stays within there contained so that's what that does border radius two pixels a nice little subtle all the way around we're going to give it a box shadow and this is just going to be an offset 0 12 pixels 0 negative 6 pixels and then f a 9 0 3. all that's doing is that little 3d effect that offset pale blue shadow makes it look 3d you'll see in a sec here let's go check it out there it is it is over here on the right and it's got that two pixel border radius and then offset shadow but the problem with sticky sidebar is that there's no space in between the two it doesn't look very good and and that is a problem right there so let's go ahead and continue over here we're going to say position position fixed that's going to fix it in place but we got to tell it where to stay put 5 from the right the width will be 36 percent that's to give it a little bit of a gap between the sandbox because we don't want it to be the full width of its of what's left we want to give it some space from that sandbox i want to float that right save that come over here check out the student version sticky sidebar selfcontained when i scroll down it stays put nice and in place and really that is it now i have a little challenge for you if you want to take this a bit further outside of the scope of this lesson but fully something that you should try is make this responsive currently it is not responsive so if i resize this we're just going to have a sticky sidebar that you know it doesn't look very good the text
