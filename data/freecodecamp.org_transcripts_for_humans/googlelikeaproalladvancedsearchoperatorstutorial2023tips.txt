00:00 - in this course Seth golden will teach
00:01 - you how to Google like a pro knowing how
00:04 - to craft the perfect queries can make a
00:07 - huge impact on your efficiency and
00:09 - overall experience Seth has been using
00:12 - Google to help him develop software for
00:14 - many years and he's currently a CS
00:16 - student at Yale University are you
00:19 - effective at searching the web you
00:21 - access the internet every single day
00:24 - after spending so much time searching do
00:27 - you consider yourself to be a pro
00:29 - okay did you know that you can force
00:32 - Google to search exactly for a
00:34 - particular term by putting double quotes
00:36 - around a word or phrase that quote is a
00:39 - search operator and it's extremely
00:41 - powerful maybe you already knew that but
00:44 - there's a lot more where that came from
00:46 - in this video
00:48 - searching is a skill not often taught in
00:50 - school or boot camps yet many people
00:53 - from programmers just getting started to
00:55 - senior Engineers heavily rely on it if
00:58 - you're spending a third of your time
01:00 - researching information that means a
01:02 - hefty chunk of your job is just being
01:05 - great with Google
01:06 - I'd argue it's among the most important
01:09 - skills a programmer can bring to the
01:11 - table
01:12 - but with millions of results to sit
01:14 - through most people struggle to pick out
01:16 - the most relevant
01:18 - the reality is you're not always going
01:20 - to know everything you will run into
01:23 - some bug you can't figure out
01:25 - maybe you decide to learn a new
01:27 - programming language or how to develop a
01:29 - feature I guarantee you'll use search to
01:31 - find relevant documentation and articles
01:33 - and potentially to help understand them
01:36 - becoming better at search will make a
01:39 - massive difference in your productivity
01:40 - and efficiency whether you're a software
01:43 - developer or not
01:45 - and if you're an online learner the
01:47 - number one reason why people fail to
01:50 - complete curricula such as that
01:51 - available on free code Camp is because
01:54 - they get stuck and can't figure out
01:55 - their problem the internet has almost
01:58 - all the answers but you need to be able
02:00 - to extract them
02:01 - in this video course I'm going to
02:03 - explain how Google works underneath the
02:06 - hood I'll discuss how to form the best
02:08 - queries a fancy word for questions and
02:11 - identify the best results and I'm going
02:14 - to introduce you to around 30 to 40
02:16 - search operators that will power up your
02:18 - searches to the next level
02:20 - you'll learn to use these operators to
02:22 - augment your existing searches and
02:25 - instead of randomly clicking on the
02:26 - first view of millions of results you'll
02:29 - be able to search for fewer higher
02:31 - quality answers
02:32 - while the info in this video is focused
02:35 - on Google as per the title much of it
02:38 - will apply to other popular search
02:39 - engines such as Bing DuckDuckGo Baidu
02:43 - Yahoo Brave kagi and more I'm also going
02:47 - to touch on more specialized and
02:49 - alternative search options towards the
02:51 - end this video does have a programming
02:53 - Ben but I'm going to try and keep it as
02:55 - approachable as possible even if it only
02:58 - offers you a couple new Tools in your
03:00 - search Arsenal this video could have a
03:02 - massive impact on your work simply
03:04 - because of how much you use search
03:06 - stop being a passive web searcher let's
03:09 - get started
03:10 - [Music]
03:18 - if you're watching this video you
03:20 - probably use Google a lot but that's
03:22 - pretty easy for me to predict everyone
03:24 - does the average person makes three to
03:27 - four Google searches per day
03:29 - as programmers we're super users often
03:32 - searching anywhere from 2 to 20 times
03:34 - that I certainly fall into that camp
03:36 - personally
03:38 - there are many awesome resources out
03:40 - there stack Overflow medium dev.2 and of
03:44 - course free code Camp which are
03:46 - accessible via a simple search
03:48 - a common misconception is that you're
03:50 - searching the web in reality you're
03:52 - searching Google's index of the web in
03:56 - many ways Google is like the Hub station
03:58 - that connects us to all the different
03:59 - parts of the internet where we hang out
04:01 - for many people that internet is Google
04:04 - and Facebook
04:06 - I'm going to help you understand how
04:08 - Google search works behind the scenes
04:10 - knowing why some sites rank higher than
04:13 - others may help you more effectively
04:15 - find what you're looking for
04:16 - if you're already familiar with how
04:18 - Google search works or more interested
04:20 - in ways that you can phrase search
04:21 - queries feel free to skip to the next
04:24 - part
04:27 - the original algorithm that Google used
04:29 - to order web pages was known as pagerank
04:32 - developed in 1996 by the founders of
04:35 - Google Sergey Brin and Larry Page the
04:38 - concept is basically what if we applied
04:40 - how citations work in Academia to the
04:43 - entire internet
04:44 - in the research world the more citations
04:46 - a paper has the more important and
04:49 - relevant it's considered to be pagerank
04:51 - similarly theorized that many websites
04:54 - would link the most important Pages a
04:57 - concept called backlinks it examines how
05:00 - many quality internal and external links
05:02 - a web page has to estimate its
05:04 - importance if a lot of high quality
05:06 - sites link to some new page that page
05:09 - might be high quality too when this
05:12 - algorithm was applied to a commercial
05:13 - search engine which was originally
05:15 - called backrub it was able to surface
05:17 - results that were more useful to
05:19 - Consumers pagerank is actually public
05:21 - domain even if you're not familiar with
05:23 - some of the math it's a pretty
05:25 - interesting read
05:26 - while pagerank is still considered as a
05:28 - factor when ordering search results
05:29 - today it's not quite the same as in the
05:32 - original paper plus it's now in
05:34 - combination with several other stronger
05:36 - signals
05:41 - so how does this work today
05:43 - here's where your search results
05:44 - currently come from
05:46 - first Google crawls the web that means
05:49 - it algorithmically discovers and
05:51 - compiles new and updated web pages into
05:54 - a massive internal database of millions
05:57 - and billions of sites
05:59 - there's also a few ways search engines
06:01 - like Google can find a new web page such
06:03 - as sending Bots also known as spiders to
06:06 - visit them following links from known
06:07 - Pages people can also submit Pages for
06:10 - Google to index which is called using a
06:12 - site map
06:13 - Google renders the web page during this
06:15 - process which includes running
06:17 - JavaScript in order to ensure that all
06:19 - content is visible and keep track of the
06:21 - information on each web page
06:23 - now that Google has this massive
06:25 - registry of information they need to
06:27 - organize it somehow
06:28 - the content in newly crawled web pages
06:31 - is analyzed and used for indexing if
06:34 - you're familiar with webdev this
06:35 - includes looking at Hidden metadata such
06:37 - as title tags in the HTML
06:40 - Google then tries to filter out low
06:42 - quality content this is really important
06:44 - as the reason you probably keep coming
06:46 - back to Google is because you find it
06:47 - reliably helpful
06:49 - search engines determine the quality of
06:51 - content through signals which are
06:53 - thousands of characteristics of web
06:55 - pages that align with what humans might
06:57 - interpret as high quality or reliable
07:00 - pagerank which I discussed before is one
07:02 - of those signals speed and web vitals
07:05 - are also strongly considered
07:06 - another is rankbrand which uses AI to
07:10 - conduct semantic search or make sense of
07:12 - the connections between links and
07:13 - content and web pages
07:15 - Google stated that rankbrain learns to
07:17 - improve over time and was at least at
07:19 - one point the third most important
07:21 - signal
07:22 - there are also thousands of search
07:24 - quality raters who have the job of
07:25 - ensuring these signals are working as
07:27 - intended
07:28 - after quality filtering Google clusters
07:31 - web pages with similar information one
07:34 - web page is selected to best represent
07:36 - each group of similar Pages this is what
07:38 - you see in the search results
07:40 - Google's algorithm is still somewhat
07:42 - Secret
07:43 - in part because of the Black Box nature
07:46 - of AI and in part to try and avoid
07:48 - people gaming the system
07:50 - so what happens when you search
07:52 - something
07:53 - whenever you enter a query Google does
07:56 - its best to use some of the signals I
07:58 - discussed before and interpret what your
08:00 - search means this can be tricky as like
08:02 - humans search engines have difficulty in
08:04 - identifying things like tone from text
08:07 - alone
08:08 - according to Google it took five years
08:11 - to develop their system for spelling
08:13 - mistakes and synonym matching but it's
08:15 - now used in around thirty percent of
08:16 - searches so I'd say it's probably worth
08:18 - it
08:19 - after Google has an idea of the meaning
08:21 - of your search they then scan their
08:23 - database for the web pages they believe
08:25 - will be most relevant
08:27 - relevancy is influenced by literally
08:30 - hundreds of factors such as your
08:32 - location and language
08:34 - because Google's registry is so massive
08:37 - there will often be millions of results
08:38 - relevant to your search
08:40 - those pages are ranked programmatically
08:43 - based on their relevance and then served
08:44 - to you usually in a few milliseconds
08:47 - let's say I search for science
08:49 - internships some information Google has
08:52 - on me from my last three months of usage
08:54 - my location is at a university
08:57 - I'm studying computer science I read The
09:00 - Verge TechCrunch and free code camp and
09:03 - three of my most visited websites are
09:05 - GitHub free codecamp and stack overflow
09:08 - Google was able to use this context in
09:10 - combination with my query Which is
09:12 - popular from my area and determined that
09:14 - what I actually want to see information
09:16 - on is not science internships but
09:19 - computer science internships and you can
09:22 - actually test how this works from any
09:23 - location
09:24 - now that you have a better idea of how
09:27 - Google serves web pages let's see how
09:29 - you can form better queries
09:34 - [Music]
09:44 - time to discuss the ultimate question
09:46 - for getting the most out of Google what
09:49 - should you actually type in the search
09:50 - box how can we take the inordinate
09:53 - number of results and filter them down
09:55 - to what you truly want
09:57 - be thoughtful searching efficiently is
10:00 - about finding the balance between
10:01 - concise and descriptive queries begin
10:04 - with something simple like what is X or
10:07 - how did y depending on the results of
10:09 - your search you can reformat your
10:11 - phrasing
10:12 - use what we learned about how Google
10:14 - works whenever you make a search put
10:17 - yourself in the mindset of the person
10:19 - writing your answer
10:20 - when rephrasing your question consider
10:23 - what words might they include in the
10:24 - title or content of your ideal web page
10:26 - what synonyms or key phrases
10:29 - for instance don't search I'm confused
10:32 - by when I should use semicolons Instead
10:34 - try when to use semicolons or semicolon
10:38 - grammar tips
10:40 - being more precise in your queries
10:42 - usually translates to more relevant
10:44 - results
10:46 - let's say you love to bake how to bake
10:48 - the best apple pie returns 214 Million
10:52 - results
10:53 - a more specific search such as best
10:56 - Dutch apple pie recipe has under 8
10:59 - million that are closer to what I'm
11:01 - craving
11:02 - as a patient you might search what's the
11:04 - best place to treat heart disease where
11:07 - a more effective search could be best
11:09 - hospital for Pediatric heart transplant
11:11 - and if you're debugging there's dozens
11:13 - of things you can try here
11:16 - still it's possible to be too specific
11:19 - consider what you actually want to learn
11:21 - and avoid including redundant or
11:23 - unnecessary terms in your query
11:25 - let's say I need to know how to execute
11:27 - a piece of code when a widget loads in
11:29 - flutter for a loading screen for example
11:32 - instead of searching flutter async login
11:34 - widget I can search flutter async widget
11:37 - while specifying loading might be more
11:40 - specific it can also cause Google to
11:42 - return fewer quality examples of what I
11:45 - really want to know which is the concept
11:46 - of asynchronous widgets in flutter
11:49 - think about how complex your query is
11:52 - can you break it down into smaller
11:54 - questions try to distill the core issue
11:57 - of your search into the set of terms
11:58 - that you use Google is often more
12:01 - effective when retrieving information
12:02 - for one question at a time
12:05 - watch your words when choosing words to
12:08 - include in a query there's a few things
12:10 - to keep in mind
12:12 - first every word is Meaningful as a
12:14 - single word can make a massive impact on
12:16 - the results you receive for example Dove
12:19 - a Dove d Dove and Dove chocolate will
12:21 - all return very different results in the
12:24 - last case it's very clear you're
12:25 - searching for the chocolate brand but
12:28 - even small words like a or V inform
12:30 - Google that you're not searching for the
12:32 - beauty products
12:33 - to be safe type words that commonly
12:36 - appear next to each other in the way
12:37 - that you'd expect to see them French
12:39 - horn not horn French
12:42 - spelling punctuation and capitalization
12:45 - do not matter
12:46 - free code Camp free code camp in all
12:48 - caps and free code camp and snake case
12:50 - or title case all return the exact same
12:52 - results
12:55 - Sergey Brin once said his goal was for
12:57 - Google to know what you're searching for
12:59 - before you do we haven't yet fully
13:02 - reached that point but it can certainly
13:03 - help you get a question from your head
13:05 - into the search bar a lot faster
13:07 - understanding how Google generates
13:09 - autocompletion can give you an idea of
13:11 - topics similar to what you're
13:12 - researching it can help you complete
13:14 - your queries more quickly Google States
13:17 - their autocomplete future reduces
13:18 - overall typing by around 25 which adds
13:21 - up to about 200 years worth of typing
13:23 - each day
13:24 - predictions are generated by comparing
13:26 - the characters that have been entered
13:28 - with what you've searched before and
13:29 - what other people in your region have
13:31 - searched Google also has systems for
13:33 - predicting portions of a search rather
13:35 - than the entire query their autocomplete
13:37 - engine will automatically shift from one
13:39 - mode to the other
13:41 - let's say you're confused by the complex
13:43 - IOS app development pipeline if you
13:46 - search tutorial for how to install Apple
13:48 - developer certificates Google may help
13:50 - finish the second part of that phrase as
13:52 - an extra tip if you can't remember a
13:54 - word when using autocomplete you can
13:56 - replace it with an underscore as a
13:58 - wildcard word
13:59 - if you want to get more unbiased results
14:01 - you can open up an incognito tab in
14:04 - Chrome that's accomplished with Ctrl
14:06 - shift n this will lock you out of all
14:09 - accounts and enable you to find results
14:10 - without the important influence of your
14:12 - personal search history
14:14 - these tips will hopefully help you ask
14:16 - better questions but even very specific
14:19 - searches can offer millions of results
14:21 - to sift through and the next part I'll
14:23 - discuss how you can pick out the most
14:25 - helpful ones
14:27 - [Music]
14:42 - thank you
14:45 - throughout the rest of this video I'm
14:47 - going to cover how to use keywords and
14:49 - operators to filter your results
14:50 - techniques features keyboard shortcuts
14:54 - Etc these will all help you obtain more
14:56 - helpful and relevant results but
14:58 - ultimately determining the most accurate
15:01 - and useful information is going to be up
15:03 - to you
15:04 - many people blindly trust the first
15:06 - three results will be best the number
15:09 - one position on the results page gets a
15:11 - third of all traffic but successful
15:13 - online research requires critical
15:15 - thinking the first search result the
15:18 - first stack Overflow answer those won't
15:20 - always be accurate or helpful let's
15:23 - examine the search results page or serp
15:25 - the one with all the Blue Links
15:28 - each result on the search results page
15:30 - has a title URL and description also
15:33 - known as the abstract snippet as I
15:35 - mentioned before these are ranked by
15:37 - relevance
15:38 - don't stop with the top result instead
15:41 - of randomly flicking on the first few
15:42 - links from the millions of results try
15:45 - this
15:46 - look at the entire page and consider the
15:49 - context surrounding the question you had
15:50 - or the concept you're trying to learn
15:52 - remember what you previously thought
15:55 - your ideal search result would include
15:56 - and it's title word content now see if
15:59 - any of the results on the serp match
16:01 - that info in their titles or
16:03 - descriptions reading results carefully
16:05 - is the most important part of this
16:07 - entire process
16:08 - the descriptions of each result often
16:11 - have relevant bolded terms in them if I
16:14 - search how to audit a class online I'll
16:16 - see the top result has bolded auditing a
16:18 - course
16:19 - if you see words or unfamiliar with in a
16:22 - title or description don't skip that
16:24 - result you can open another Tab and look
16:27 - up the definition and then return to
16:29 - your research
16:30 - another essential tool that Google
16:32 - Engineers recommend for finding an
16:34 - answer or getting a handle on a topic is
16:36 - called lateral browsing when I'm
16:38 - researching a topic or debugging some
16:40 - code I'll often control click on several
16:43 - results at once this will open them in
16:46 - new tabs for me to peruse swapping
16:48 - between is needed to cross-reference
16:50 - content when scanning through your
16:52 - search results take note of top level
16:53 - domain names or tlds these are the
16:56 - highest level of abstraction for domain
16:58 - name systems or the DNS and noted as the
17:01 - ending of each domain name tlds are
17:04 - important as a way of gauging reputation
17:06 - authenticity or authority
17:09 - in the United States sites for
17:11 - educational institutions will commonly
17:13 - end with DOT edu this is generally an
17:16 - easy way to identify more reputable
17:18 - sources it also applies for other tlds
17:21 - such as.gov for government websites you
17:24 - can often pick a website's Source based
17:26 - on their domain ending with a country
17:27 - code for instance sites based in Spain
17:30 - might end with es and sites in India
17:32 - often end with Dot in
17:34 - notably you don't need to live in a
17:36 - country to use their country code as a
17:38 - domain ending dot IO meant to refer to
17:42 - sites in the British Indian Ocean
17:43 - territory has been heavily adopted by
17:46 - computer scientists because it can refer
17:47 - to input output and because it sounds
17:50 - cool
17:51 - internationally many tlds combine a
17:54 - country code with endings such as dot
17:57 - geo.br.co.in which are the equivalent of
18:00 - dot gov and.com domains respectively
18:03 - you may come across information while
18:05 - searching the web that you question
18:08 - some info can change significantly based
18:10 - on context if you search for the number
18:13 - of programmers in the world that number
18:14 - will change based on how the source
18:16 - defines a programmer
18:18 - don't accept that anything you read on
18:20 - the Internet is authoritatively accurate
18:22 - Google does their best to filter out Bad
18:24 - actors but stuff slips through the
18:26 - cracks additionally even people with
18:29 - good intentions often make it difficult
18:30 - to verify their statements if I said 73
18:34 - of programmers go to bed before midnight
18:36 - how can you best confirm that ideally I
18:40 - have provided a source but I didn't so
18:42 - as far as you know I just pulled that
18:43 - number out of my butt who's considered a
18:46 - programmer time zone success so midnight
18:49 - where
18:50 - as an inquisitive person you can start
18:53 - by conducting another search of your own
18:55 - but take care to not include the answer
18:57 - in your query that's an easy way to have
18:59 - confirmation bias
19:01 - if you search for Are there 25 million
19:04 - programmers in the world chances are
19:06 - someone in the world has written down or
19:08 - recorded that statistic you've found it
19:11 - on the web but that doesn't mean the
19:13 - numbers right
19:14 - a search asking JavaScript is the most
19:17 - popular programming language is likely
19:19 - to pull up information saying that yeah
19:20 - people love JavaScript
19:22 - Instead try and write more General
19:24 - open-ended queries like most popular
19:27 - programming language 2022 or how many
19:30 - programmers in the world
19:32 - a fantastic way to verify information is
19:35 - to find several perspectives if multiple
19:38 - credible sources agree on an answer it's
19:41 - more likely to be correct check to see
19:44 - when content was written and where it's
19:45 - Source from then consider if that makes
19:48 - sense for the subject matter for
19:50 - instance an article about a quote
19:51 - attributed to a person who passed away
19:53 - long before any references connecting
19:55 - the two on the web
19:57 - did you know that the famous line Luke I
20:00 - am your father is different when set in
20:02 - Star Wars the line is actually no I am
20:05 - your father simply searching Luke I am
20:08 - your father will probably pull up this
20:09 - result that you can go deeper by
20:11 - searching for the original script of The
20:13 - Empire Strikes Back reputable sources
20:16 - are really important
20:17 - the new highly cited indicator that
20:19 - appears on sources that are being used
20:21 - as a reference for other news outlets is
20:23 - one feature that helps with this
20:26 - additionally check if a site you've
20:28 - discovered in your research has any
20:29 - reviews or if people have discussed it
20:31 - and forums like Reddit whenever you're
20:34 - reading information ask yourself why
20:36 - might this site not be reputable or
20:39 - trustworthy
20:40 - while forums are incredibly useful since
20:43 - anyone can post take everything set on
20:45 - stack exchange sites and similar sources
20:47 - with a grain of salt
20:49 - Wikipedia though is actually still a
20:51 - fantastic place to start a search
20:53 - because there are usually dozens of
20:55 - curated citations related to your topic
20:57 - to view
21:00 - one of the most important parts of
21:01 - thinking critically while searching the
21:03 - web is asking yourself effective
21:04 - questions is there evidence for this is
21:07 - it always the case what's an alternative
21:09 - viewpoint
21:10 - also ask yourself questions about these
21:13 - questions does that make sense what
21:16 - assumptions do I make can I break this
21:18 - down into smaller questions
21:20 - as humans we're hardwired to dislike
21:23 - information that conflicts with our
21:24 - pre-existing beliefs this is one of the
21:27 - trickier aspects of becoming a pro web
21:29 - searcher you need to be willing to
21:30 - accept all answers from trustworthy
21:33 - sources with an open mind even if it
21:36 - makes you feel uncomfortable if you are
21:38 - feeling emotional about an answer
21:39 - conduct another search to confirm its
21:41 - validity
21:43 - but stay skeptical if a piece of
21:45 - information seems sketchy maybe it is it
21:48 - can be worth it to see what conflicts of
21:50 - interest a source may have if a site is
21:52 - backed by a politically motivated or
21:54 - extremist organization it's likely that
21:57 - the authenticity of Journalism of that
21:59 - source is compromised many sites also
22:01 - pretend to be affiliated with a
22:03 - reputable person or organization so
22:05 - always assess whether what you're
22:07 - looking at is actually legitimate
22:09 - an easy way to do that is to do another
22:11 - query searching who owns
22:13 - freecodecamp.org will pull up the name
22:15 - Quincy Larson by reading more about
22:17 - Quincy perhaps by searching who is
22:20 - Quincy Larson I can discover that he is
22:22 - a highly transparent and reputable
22:24 - person without major conflicts of
22:25 - interest but wait this video is
22:28 - published on free codecamp's Channel
22:30 - which means that I could be biased when
22:32 - I said that although I promise you
22:34 - anyone who knows Quincy will back me up
22:36 - that he's amazing
22:38 - still it's important to verify that you
22:40 - can trust not only the platform
22:42 - information is published on but
22:44 - individual authors as well
22:46 - be careful of ellipses and result
22:48 - descriptions sometimes censuses will be
22:50 - cut up in a way that's misleading it's
22:52 - usually a good idea to validate an
22:54 - answer by clicking on the link and
22:56 - reading the original text
22:58 - you can also click on the vertical
23:00 - ellipses next to a search result title
23:01 - to see Google's new about Source feature
23:04 - this will give you information on why
23:06 - Google thought that that result might be
23:08 - relevant for you
23:09 - finally keep in mind that a website's
23:12 - ranking on your search results page is
23:14 - not a reflection of its credibility
23:16 - nutty stuff can be listed as top results
23:18 - if they're relevant to your query
23:20 - similarly anything that shows up as an
23:22 - ad has generally not been evaluated for
23:25 - accuracy by Google
23:27 - now that you're an expert at extracting
23:29 - and validating information from Google
23:31 - search results I'm going to speak about
23:32 - some awesome operators that will power
23:34 - up your queries
23:38 - thank you
23:44 - Google has dozens of features called
23:47 - search operators to improve your
23:49 - searches they're extremely powerful
23:51 - filters and utilities mostly focused on
23:53 - helping you achieve much more specific
23:55 - and relevant results you've probably
23:58 - used several without knowing some are
24:00 - keywords others are special characters
24:02 - they're mostly case insensitive meaning
24:05 - it usually doesn't matter if you
24:06 - capitalize them or not and all can be
24:08 - used anywhere in your query
24:11 - Google is updating these on a regular
24:13 - basis so the list might not be fully
24:15 - comprehensive at the time you're
24:16 - watching I have personally tested them
24:18 - so they should all work at the time of
24:20 - recording let's Dive In any search term
24:23 - or phrase will refine results by
24:25 - attempting to find exact and similar
24:27 - matches by default it will follow the
24:30 - steps I outline when discussing how
24:31 - Google works if you don't want to
24:33 - remember or reference the following
24:35 - search operators every time that you
24:37 - conduct more advanced queries you can
24:39 - visit google.com Advanced underscore
24:41 - search for a simple to use interface
24:44 - foreign
24:47 - matching operators remember that first
24:51 - example I mentioned in this video using
24:53 - double quotes around any term will force
24:55 - Google to match it exactly I find this
24:58 - to be among the most useful operators
25:00 - available
25:01 - let's say you have some specific word or
25:03 - phrase such as an error code or a
25:05 - message you come across while debugging
25:07 - putting quotes around it will cause
25:09 - Google to more accurately find the right
25:11 - stack of report poster GitHub discussion
25:14 - for example quote flutter end quote app
25:17 - development tutorials will only find app
25:19 - development tutorials specific to
25:21 - flutter you can also use double quotes
25:24 - to override spelling auto correction
25:26 - this is especially useful when you're
25:28 - dealing with names with unusual spelling
25:30 - or those that are very close to
25:31 - extremely popular similar searches for
25:34 - instance if you search my name Seth
25:36 - golden you're probably going to get a
25:38 - full page of results for Seth Godin the
25:40 - famous businessman and author by
25:42 - specifying quote Seth golden end quote
25:45 - you'd be able to find my personal site
25:47 - and blog you can also use this for
25:50 - specifying a particular author when
25:51 - searching articles learn from free
25:53 - courses Seth golden in quotes would
25:55 - filter by my name
25:58 - Google will sometimes return results
26:00 - with the term or topic that you don't
26:02 - want it happens the minus operator or
26:06 - exclusion operator when used preceding a
26:08 - word will filter out any results
26:10 - containing that word this is awesome you
26:14 - can use it to easily get rid of all
26:16 - those past keywords that invade your
26:17 - search results
26:18 - because let's say you search for website
26:21 - tutorial but you don't want it to
26:22 - include the framework jQuery you can
26:25 - search website tutorial minus jQuery and
26:28 - exclude jQuery from your results
26:32 - sometimes you just need a wild card the
26:34 - asterisk operator like a diamond
26:37 - Scrabble tile can be used as a stand-in
26:39 - for literally any word or phrase I often
26:42 - use it to replace words that I've
26:43 - forgotten I can't remember how to spell
26:45 - or generally to speed up a search Linus
26:48 - asterisk Linux so return results on
26:50 - Linus torbolds the creator of git and
26:52 - Linux more quickly than if I spelled out
26:55 - his name given that I provided
26:56 - appropriate context
26:58 - I find the Wild Card operators
27:00 - particularly useful though when
27:02 - debugging often the error message that
27:04 - I'm given contains a local directory
27:06 - that will only be relevant to me instead
27:09 - of pasting that whole block of text into
27:11 - Google replacing that section of the
27:13 - error with an asterisk can significantly
27:15 - improve results this can also be helpful
27:18 - when trying to find relevant
27:19 - walkthroughs for confusing homework
27:21 - questions
27:22 - often we deal with words that have
27:24 - multiple meanings but are used in
27:25 - dramatically different contexts a
27:27 - Blackberry is both a fruit and a cell
27:30 - phone a transistor is a processing unit
27:32 - and a fantastic video game
27:34 - searching by a word's proximity to
27:36 - another word using a round and then a
27:38 - variable number is a highly effective
27:41 - way to narrow results especially when
27:43 - the two words don't often appear right
27:45 - next to each other if Google can't find
27:47 - any examples of the two words around
27:49 - each other it's going to revert to
27:50 - ranking as normal
27:52 - let's say you're looking for a tutorial
27:53 - on managing memory and computer
27:55 - environments manage around for memory is
27:59 - likely to narrow in on those particular
28:00 - results by finding any web page
28:02 - containing an instance of the word
28:04 - manage within four words of the word
28:06 - memory
28:08 - football around 6 ESL will similarly
28:12 - help me fuzzy search for specifically
28:14 - European football instead of the
28:16 - American football results that I would
28:17 - normally see
28:19 - notably this particular operator must be
28:21 - capitalized to function properly
28:27 - next up date operators whether it's
28:30 - finding recent stack Overflow answers or
28:32 - reading a review from the time a movie
28:34 - was released I constantly want results
28:36 - from before or after a specific date you
28:39 - can accomplish this with the before and
28:41 - after operators simply follow either
28:44 - with the date in the format year year
28:46 - month month day day append it to your
28:49 - query and your set
28:51 - for example an error message after 2021
28:55 - 0101 will only return results since
28:58 - January 1st 2021 meaning that I won't
29:00 - have to sit through outdated answers
29:03 - you can also choose to only pass a year
29:05 - such as before 2020 or after 2017.
29:09 - python courses after 2021 would only
29:12 - give you recent courses so that you can
29:14 - be confident that everything's up to
29:16 - date
29:17 - but wait I have a start and an end date
29:20 - in mind well there's two ways you can
29:22 - approach that you can include both a
29:24 - before and after operator in your query
29:27 - or you can use the range operator
29:30 - ellipses you can find info and
29:32 - documentation for a less common
29:34 - programming language such as with
29:36 - closure 2016.2018
29:37 - [Music]
29:40 - you don't just have to use this for
29:42 - dates any numbers will work for example
29:45 - top
29:46 - 7.10 facts Apple Computers will find a
29:50 - top 10 list or top 7 list
29:52 - the ellipses operator can be a little
29:54 - finicky though so don't expect this one
29:56 - to work 100 of the time
30:00 - [Music]
30:02 - next up Source operators Google provides
30:05 - several options to filter by content
30:07 - type and source
30:09 - some people joke that Google is a better
30:12 - search engine for Reddit than Reddit
30:14 - amusingly enough I have found this to be
30:17 - often true many sites have periodically
30:19 - ineffective internal search engines
30:21 - including hugely popular ones such as
30:23 - Amazon
30:24 - I also find that sites like Reddit and
30:27 - similar forums can have more trustworthy
30:29 - human responses to my questions than the
30:31 - average first search result so I often
30:34 - choose to filter my results by these
30:35 - sites accordingly
30:37 - site is extraordinarily powerful because
30:40 - it allows you to force Google to only
30:42 - return results from a particular website
30:44 - a pending site colon freecodecamp.org to
30:48 - a query will only return results from
30:50 - free codecamp importantly you can also
30:53 - use sites with the top level domain
30:55 - endings or tlds that I discussed earlier
30:58 - in this video
30:59 - site.edu will restrict your results to
31:02 - purely educational resources such as
31:04 - with berkeley.edu or yale.edu
31:07 - search followed by a website URL
31:10 - accomplishes the same thing in most
31:11 - browsers but I prefer site URL because
31:14 - it's shorter
31:16 - on occasion you'll need to search for
31:18 - PDFs PowerPoints or other documents on
31:21 - the web to force Google to only display
31:23 - results that match a particular file
31:25 - extension you can use EXT or file type
31:28 - which are functionally identical simply
31:30 - follow either with an extension such as
31:33 - txt PDF docs PPT xox CSV ePub Etc in the
31:40 - format file type colon PDF
31:43 - I find this operator is super useful in
31:46 - searching for textbooks academic papers
31:48 - novels presentations and especially
31:51 - anything when relating to academic
31:53 - research
31:54 - unfortunately file type no longer works
31:57 - for MP3 files
31:59 - if you prefer to search the web for news
32:01 - rather than follow 400 RSS feeds like me
32:04 - this Source operator is a great way to
32:07 - specify the site that Google News should
32:08 - pull from for instance Amazon source
32:12 - techcruncher source The Verge GitHub
32:16 - your search results can be extremely
32:18 - different based on your location well
32:21 - Google tries to use your current
32:22 - location by default it's possible that
32:24 - you'll want to specify somewhere else
32:27 - in San Francisco will change my results
32:30 - to be more relevant to the Bay Area even
32:32 - if I'm searching from the East Coast
32:36 - I'm a fan of blogging and reading other
32:37 - people's blogs it's often a more
32:40 - personal and conversational experience
32:42 - about Niche topics of your interest
32:44 - while sub stack and similar providers
32:46 - have Consolidated a lot of bloggers many
32:48 - websites and companies still run their
32:50 - own blogs you can find these through the
32:52 - blog URL operator which attempts to find
32:55 - any blog posts under a domain
32:57 - blog URL google.com will pull out the
33:01 - blogs under Google's registrar it can be
33:04 - a little finicky sometimes though
33:08 - no website is ever able to escape going
33:11 - down every so often you can utilize the
33:14 - cache operator to pull Google's cached
33:16 - or backup saved version of any website
33:19 - for example I can see all of free
33:22 - codecamp's articles even if the site is
33:24 - down by typing cache freecodecamp.org
33:31 - next up Boolean operators Google
33:34 - automatically tries to include all the
33:37 - content within your query
33:39 - so and is best utilized in combination
33:41 - with other operators since it doesn't do
33:43 - anything by itself I'll discuss
33:44 - combining operators in more detail later
33:48 - as I just noted Google searches defaults
33:50 - including everything in your query the
33:52 - or operator is unique from other
33:55 - operators as it causes Google to alter
33:57 - that behavior and increase the number of
34:00 - search results rather than filtering
34:01 - some out
34:02 - using the pipe operator or
34:05 - A or B you can scan for a or b
34:10 - you'll get results related to a or b or
34:13 - importantly both
34:15 - if I'm interested in multiple variants
34:17 - of a data science algorithm I can
34:19 - conduct a search on k-means or k-means
34:22 - plus plus to return any result it refers
34:24 - to either
34:26 - the or operator is also useful when
34:28 - searching for something that's known by
34:30 - several names in the American Civil War
34:32 - the Union Soldiers referred to a
34:34 - conflict that took place in Virginia as
34:36 - the Battle of Bull Run but the
34:39 - Confederate soldiers kept their records
34:40 - based on waterways and in their records
34:42 - they called it the battle of Manassas
34:44 - when searching about this topic Battle
34:47 - of Bull Run and battle of Manassas each
34:50 - returns significantly less information
34:52 - than Battle of Bull Run or battle of
34:55 - Manassas
34:56 - as I noted before make sure you
34:58 - capitalize or or Google might not
35:01 - recognize it as an operator
35:04 - [Music]
35:06 - next up the in operators
35:09 - these operators can be used to massively
35:11 - narrow your search results based on the
35:13 - content included in my page metadata
35:16 - if you're unfamiliar with web dev by
35:18 - metadata I mean the URL or website link
35:21 - and internal information such as the
35:23 - page title content and anchors
35:26 - each of these operators has two versions
35:28 - an in option and an all-in option the
35:32 - results for both will be similar but all
35:34 - in will only return results containing
35:36 - all of the following terms they both
35:39 - help to ensure that the words you're
35:40 - looking for will actually be present on
35:42 - the pages returned as results
35:45 - websites will often put important
35:47 - information in the URL of web pages you
35:51 - can use in url tutorial to only return
35:54 - tutorials or all in url tutorial python
35:58 - app for more specificity
36:00 - remember how the file type operator no
36:02 - longer works for filtering Out MP3 files
36:05 - you can actually use the in url operator
36:08 - as a substitute such as searching for
36:10 - Lo-Fi in url MP3
36:14 - the title of a web page is one of the
36:16 - best ways to tell how relevant it will
36:18 - be to you in title flutter will only
36:21 - return websites that refer to flutter
36:23 - while all in title flutter app tutorial
36:25 - will have fewer hits
36:28 - the keyword you're looking for isn't
36:30 - always included in the title or URL in
36:32 - those cases in-text and all in text will
36:35 - have more benefit
36:38 - anchors are often invisible linkable
36:40 - section headers of web pages they're
36:42 - usually indicated by hashtags such as
36:44 - hashtag hero or hashtag testimonials in
36:47 - anchor and all in Anchor will help you
36:49 - identify web pages with such tags
36:52 - notably these inclusion search operators
36:55 - are often best used in combination with
36:57 - each other they help you extract web
36:59 - pages that might not have been surfaced
37:01 - otherwise
37:06 - finally Google provides many utility
37:09 - operators that you can use to quickly
37:11 - access all kinds of data I use these all
37:14 - the time
37:16 - wondering what a word means Define and
37:19 - then the word will tell you using
37:20 - Google's built-in dictionary it'll
37:22 - likely display in a side panel along
37:24 - with synonyms Define entrepreneurship
37:27 - will quickly pull up the definition and
37:29 - you don't even need to be able to spell
37:30 - the word properly
37:33 - related is one of the more interesting
37:35 - operators the Google offers it returns
37:37 - websites that are similar to The
37:40 - Following domain in the format related
37:42 - colon and then the web page URL
37:44 - it's useful for breadth of research
37:47 - particularly when trying to learn
37:48 - something for instance related
37:51 - freecodecamp.org will return sites like
37:53 - codeacademy.org coursera.org
37:56 - Etc
37:57 - need to check your public IP address the
38:00 - unique identifier that allows your
38:02 - computer to receive information just
38:04 - enter IP address and Google can display
38:06 - what it identifies as your public
38:07 - Internet Protocol
38:10 - do you know how many pounds are in a
38:11 - kilogram off the top of your head or how
38:13 - to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius or
38:16 - how many milliliters are in a quart by
38:19 - using the format X in y Google can
38:21 - swiftly tell you for example
38:24 - 456 dollars in euros will tell me that
38:27 - 456 dollars is at the time of recording
38:31 - 434.45 in euros
38:35 - online shopping is huge right now
38:38 - chances are you probably search Google
38:40 - to see different places that offer your
38:42 - item of interest if you're looking for a
38:44 - specific price you can search 300 with
38:47 - the dollar sign Android and Google will
38:50 - attempt to match that
38:51 - you can also apply the range operator
38:53 - here and search keyboard dollar sign 10
38:56 - dot dot dot dollar sign 50.
39:03 - looking for a social media account of a
39:05 - friend or content creator instead of
39:07 - searching their name prepend an at
39:10 - symbol to their social media handle to
39:12 - more effectively pull up all their
39:13 - social accounts
39:16 - want to immediately know the weather for
39:18 - any location you can just search the
39:20 - word weather for your location but to
39:22 - specify others append the location like
39:25 - weather colon Bangkok while you might
39:28 - use apps like Google or Apple Maps or
39:30 - ways for your mapping needs sometimes
39:32 - you'll need to search for One while it
39:34 - Returns the current location by default
39:35 - you can specify a particular location
39:37 - like map colon London
39:40 - there's a new movie out and you want to
39:42 - go see it while searching the movie
39:44 - titles usually enough to pull it up if
39:46 - it's based on a book or something
39:48 - similar your search might not pull up
39:49 - exactly what you want using movie
39:52 - Avengers endgame is then a foolproof way
39:55 - to get a lot of info about any film
39:57 - including reviews cast and crew and
39:59 - nearby show times
40:01 - fintech person you can see all the
40:03 - stonks for any ticker by searching
40:05 - stocks colon and then the appropriate
40:07 - ticker such as stocks colon Amazon for
40:10 - immediate information about the price
40:11 - history of Amazon
40:13 - there are several other tools you can
40:15 - access straight from Google's search bar
40:16 - if you type any math equation Google
40:19 - will automatically calculate the answer
40:21 - if you ever need an on-demand clock type
40:23 - timer or stopwatch to pull one up or
40:25 - type X minute timer to automatically
40:27 - start one search for flip a coin or roll
40:30 - a die when you need to cast a stitch in
40:32 - time or any other situation when
40:34 - generating a probability is necessary
40:37 - you can also pull up a quick reference
40:39 - tip calculator with tip calculator this
40:42 - calculator feature can also be useful
40:43 - for very important factoids like the
40:45 - number of horns on a unicorn and the
40:47 - probability of once in a blue moon
40:49 - together you can use these utilities to
40:52 - more quickly access everyday information
40:54 - while they may not be as essential in
40:56 - the software world they're still going
40:58 - to help you make better searches in your
40:59 - day-to-day life
41:02 - foreign
41:08 - these are a lot of tools that you can
41:10 - utilize to filter your searches and
41:12 - operators become even more powerful when
41:15 - you're able to combine them effectively
41:16 - for example how to build an asterisk app
41:20 - site colon freecodecamp.org minus
41:22 - flutter will give me results on any kind
41:25 - of app tutorial except letter on free
41:27 - codecamp containing the name Quincy
41:28 - Larson
41:29 - another helpful combination could
41:31 - include the site and URL and exclusion
41:33 - operators you can search site colon
41:36 - freecodecamp.org minus in url blog to
41:39 - get all the subdomains except blogs or
41:42 - you can find insecure pages on a website
41:45 - using site colon domainname.com where
41:48 - you fill in the appropriate domain name
41:49 - minus in URL https
41:54 - I find combining the wild card and exact
41:56 - match operators to be very useful
41:59 - quote python asterisk tutorial end quote
42:02 - will return any results with python and
42:04 - tutorial in that order with anything in
42:07 - between for example python app tutorial
42:10 - the wildcard operator is also very easy
42:13 - to include with other operators such as
42:15 - site and numerl you can use parentheses
42:18 - to power up your combinations of
42:19 - operators I commonly use these when
42:21 - grouping for order of operations with
42:23 - Boolean operators like or or when using
42:26 - synonyms if I want to specify a bunch of
42:29 - synonyms when searching for a resume I
42:31 - can do that keep in mind that the pipe
42:32 - operator or or operator are functionally
42:35 - identical
42:38 - Google processes and and or operators in
42:40 - a logical order make sure to use
42:42 - parentheses when necessary for instance
42:44 - Python and parentheses JavaScript or
42:47 - typescript parentheses will be
42:49 - interpreted as looking for results
42:50 - including Python and either JavaScript
42:53 - or typescript alternatively Python and
42:56 - JavaScript or pipe script will return
42:59 - results with python and JavaScript or
43:01 - results with just typescript not in any
43:03 - way related to python
43:05 - let's say I'm looking for tutorials on
43:07 - the language closure by linking together
43:09 - search operators I'm able to form a
43:11 - query which gives me only about a
43:13 - hundred highly focused results
43:15 - there are practically endless number of
43:17 - combinations of search operators I
43:19 - encourage you to consider what will be
43:21 - most beneficial for your search and mix
43:23 - and match accordingly

44:05 - next few parts I'm going to discuss
44:07 - several features specialized search
44:09 - options and search related tools that
44:11 - you might find helpful since you've used
44:13 - Google you're familiar with how to
44:15 - search for images just type in some
44:16 - keywords click on the images tab and
44:18 - voila but what if you already have the
44:21 - image or in front of it and you need to
44:23 - figure out what it is or where it's from
44:25 - Google image search and Google Lens are
44:28 - two powerful tools to accomplish that
44:30 - you can access reverse image search by
44:33 - clicking the camera icon or visiting
44:35 - images.google.com
44:37 - upload or drag your image into the
44:39 - search bar and it will scan the web for
44:41 - images that look similar for instance I
44:44 - have this image of some phones and a
44:45 - yellow background that I pulled off of
44:47 - unsplash and used in a blog post I can
44:50 - upload it to reverse image search and
44:52 - see all the other websites that are
44:53 - using it as part of their articles these
44:55 - include five ways the original iPhone
44:57 - was ahead of its time Apple now has one
45:00 - billion active iPhones around the world
45:02 - and these are the top four highest
45:04 - selling iPhones of all time I can also
45:06 - filter for other sizes of the image and
45:08 - photos that are similar plus you can use
45:11 - the color drop down menu under search
45:13 - tools to filter photos by color
45:14 - transparency picture size and animation
45:17 - effect to find that perfect gif this
45:20 - also works for faces clip art and line
45:22 - drawings
45:24 - reverse image search is useful if you
45:26 - already have a photo and you're sitting
45:28 - at a computer but what if there's
45:30 - something right in front of you that you
45:31 - want to learn about perhaps a product
45:33 - you'd like to find online or a location
45:34 - you're at Google lens is an awesome
45:37 - relatively new feature which debuted in
45:39 - 2017 and identifies objects in your
45:42 - camera lens in real time here I'm using
45:45 - it to take a picture of my desktop
45:46 - speakers Google Lens quickly identifies
45:49 - their Logitech speakers and pulls up
45:51 - search results of their pricing and
45:52 - availability
45:53 - you can use Google Lens to search for
45:55 - homework help or excerpts of books
45:57 - online and copy text from physical
45:59 - documents similar to Apple's live text
46:01 - feature
46:02 - I'm a particular fan of their real-time
46:04 - translate function I can point my camera
46:07 - at a menu in a foreign language and
46:09 - receive a version in my preferred
46:10 - language
46:12 - these image search options may be more
46:14 - helpful in your daily life than for
46:16 - software development but they're
46:17 - incredibly useful tools to have in your
46:19 - search Arsenal
46:23 - [Music]
46:31 - thank you
46:33 - everything that Google indexes is known
46:35 - as the visible web but sometimes you
46:38 - need to delve deeper this is usually
46:40 - because of the long tail
46:42 - many people treat Google as the
46:44 - all-encompassing internet if you can't
46:46 - find it on Google it simply does not
46:48 - exist but that's not entirely the case
46:51 - before anything else make sure the
46:53 - reason you're not seeing any results
46:54 - isn't just what you searched
46:57 - a lot of times the issue is information
46:59 - retrieval not the indexing of the
47:01 - information in the first place
47:03 - if you have a hyper-specific query every
47:06 - word that you've added makes it more
47:08 - likely that you've excluded results try
47:10 - broadening your search and it's possible
47:12 - the way you're looking for will pop up
47:14 - while Google tries their best to index
47:16 - everything that can be useful the web is
47:18 - a large and complex place and Google's
47:21 - best efforts to fight spam content can
47:24 - be missed that may be important in more
47:25 - Niche scenarios seen in things like
47:28 - their indexing of large websites with
47:29 - too many subdirectories or subdomains
47:31 - and attempting to cut back on duplicate
47:34 - content Google has in some cases
47:36 - completely wiped content off their serps
47:38 - sites like GitHub or offenders here
47:40 - where some repositories can no longer be
47:42 - found on Google because they're old or
47:44 - unused but while Google's better than
47:46 - ever for the majority of searches and
47:48 - Niche cases When there's less data to
47:50 - work with you could even find nothing
47:52 - in these cases you'll want to consider
47:55 - trying alternative search options and
47:56 - specialize in the area that you're
47:58 - looking for Google actually provides a
48:01 - few of its own for more Niche areas
48:04 - Google Scholar is a massive collection
48:07 - of scholarly literature from the global
48:09 - scientific community and it is an
48:11 - amazing research for serious research it
48:13 - is primarily made up of papers published
48:15 - in respective journals spanning
48:17 - everything from biology to Neuroscience
48:19 - to machine learning and natural language
48:21 - processing to Legal opinions
48:23 - it also includes scholarly sites and
48:25 - content from universities
48:27 - Scholars particularly useful when
48:29 - conducting more thorough research on an
48:31 - academic topic with some major perks
48:34 - over traditional search
48:35 - to start it provides links that direct
48:37 - to the full version of scholarly
48:39 - articles books and reports
48:42 - scholar enables you to see the number of
48:44 - citations papers have where they're
48:46 - published and any related authors or
48:48 - Affiliated institutions it also has
48:51 - built-in options to copy citations and
48:53 - export bibliographies in formal MOA APA
48:56 - bibtex format
48:58 - you can even dive deeper into individual
49:01 - authors and view their aggregate work
49:03 - it's similar to other academic search
49:05 - engines such as papers with code web of
49:07 - Science and scopus
49:09 - while the process of entering a query is
49:11 - the same as with normal search the
49:13 - results page is a little bit different
49:14 - if I search natural language processing
49:17 - you can see that the result blocks now
49:20 - each contain bibliographic info
49:23 - this includes the title of the article
49:25 - The Source the author or authors when it
49:29 - was published and who it was published
49:30 - by
49:31 - some results will even have options to
49:33 - see the abstract or even download the
49:35 - full document as a PDF
49:37 - the version you see in Google Scholar
49:38 - may not always be the final paper Google
49:41 - does its best to show the newest freely
49:43 - available version which often means a
49:45 - preprint
49:46 - adding a year restricting by a date
49:48 - range in your search can be very useful
49:50 - in getting more recent findings try and
49:53 - make use of some of the operators we
49:54 - discussed before including and or
49:56 - exclusion and exact match operators for
50:00 - instance Neuroscience author quote Seth
50:03 - golden end quote 2022 will pull up my
50:06 - recent paper on analyzing em images or
50:09 - quote machine learning unquote minus
50:12 - medicine minus biology will return
50:14 - results or ml papers that don't have it
50:16 - to do with those sub areas
50:18 - Google Scholar is not infallible
50:20 - citation data is often not fully
50:22 - comprehensive or up to date using the
50:25 - verification skills that I discussed
50:26 - earlier try to check out the original
50:28 - publisher as well to check your findings
50:32 - Google also supports a powerful patent
50:35 - search available at patents.google.com
50:37 - you can search Google Patent Search or
50:40 - Google patents advanced search on Google
50:42 - for more options and filters
50:44 - using this tool you can find information
50:46 - on patents searching by title number
50:49 - inventor signee and more Google
50:52 - currently keeps track of patents in
50:53 - North America Europe and Japan it's a
50:56 - great resource for anyone researching
50:58 - patent information which may not be
51:00 - readily available in a general search
51:05 - [Music]
51:15 - thank you
51:16 - [Music]
51:26 - if you're unfamiliar with common browser
51:28 - keybinds I'll share a few these are
51:30 - generally the same across all browsers
51:32 - and massively increased productivity
51:35 - replace control with command and ALT
51:37 - with option if you're using Mac OS
51:40 - as I mentioned in part 3 control click
51:42 - opens a link in a new tab
51:45 - control T opens a new tab
51:48 - control W closes the current tab
51:52 - control shift F or alt F focuses the
51:56 - search bar
51:58 - control R refreshes the page
52:02 - Control Alt R hard refreshes the page
52:05 - from origin
52:07 - and Ctrl F searches for text within a
52:10 - web page this last one is super critical
52:12 - to efficient searching I constantly use
52:15 - control F to find the content that I'm
52:17 - seeking on a web page it saves tons of
52:19 - time that I'd otherwise spend skimming
52:21 - information that's potentially unrelated
52:23 - to what I'm looking for knowing these
52:25 - keyboard shortcuts will hopefully help
52:27 - you navigate the browser and complete
52:28 - searches faster

52:38 - [Music]
52:42 - congrats you're now all powered up and
52:45 - ready to go and get the most out of
52:47 - Google that puts you ahead of most of
52:49 - the other 27 million developers in the
52:51 - world
52:52 - was that statistic real try and search
52:54 - for yourself
52:56 - I encourage you to consider how you can
52:58 - combine everything that I've discussed
52:59 - in this video to obtain the best answer
53:02 - to your question
53:03 - start with a simple search use specific
53:06 - terms to narrow Focus but avoid
53:08 - unnecessary or redundant terms put
53:11 - yourself in the mindset of the person
53:12 - writing your answer break down
53:14 - multi-part queries into several searches
53:17 - verify your results browse laterally use
53:21 - search operators and take advantage of
53:23 - specialized search engines
53:25 - searches will sometimes be simple other
53:28 - times you'll be deep in the weeds
53:31 - online detective work can be hard
53:33 - my last and most important piece of
53:36 - advice don't give up it might take two
53:39 - searches or three or six rephrase your
53:42 - query and try again
53:44 - you have access to all of human
53:46 - knowledge take advantage of it
53:48 - thank you for listening to this video
53:50 - course I hope it was of some help to you
53:53 - after finishing this course do you feel
53:56 - like your approach search differently
53:58 - I want to thank the amazing people at
54:00 - free code Camp who supported the
54:01 - development of this course additionally
54:03 - my appreciation goes out to Google
54:05 - search intern Eric bozen Lincoln Baxter
54:08 - and several Google Engineers who
54:10 - requested their names remain private for
54:12 - reviewing the course material and
54:13 - helping me make it the best possible
54:15 - That's all folks

Cleaned transcript:

in this course Seth golden will teach you how to Google like a pro knowing how to craft the perfect queries can make a huge impact on your efficiency and overall experience Seth has been using Google to help him develop software for many years and he's currently a CS student at Yale University are you effective at searching the web you access the internet every single day after spending so much time searching do you consider yourself to be a pro okay did you know that you can force Google to search exactly for a particular term by putting double quotes around a word or phrase that quote is a search operator and it's extremely powerful maybe you already knew that but there's a lot more where that came from in this video searching is a skill not often taught in school or boot camps yet many people from programmers just getting started to senior Engineers heavily rely on it if you're spending a third of your time researching information that means a hefty chunk of your job is just being great with Google I'd argue it's among the most important skills a programmer can bring to the table but with millions of results to sit through most people struggle to pick out the most relevant the reality is you're not always going to know everything you will run into some bug you can't figure out maybe you decide to learn a new programming language or how to develop a feature I guarantee you'll use search to find relevant documentation and articles and potentially to help understand them becoming better at search will make a massive difference in your productivity and efficiency whether you're a software developer or not and if you're an online learner the number one reason why people fail to complete curricula such as that available on free code Camp is because they get stuck and can't figure out their problem the internet has almost all the answers but you need to be able to extract them in this video course I'm going to explain how Google works underneath the hood I'll discuss how to form the best queries a fancy word for questions and identify the best results and I'm going to introduce you to around 30 to 40 search operators that will power up your searches to the next level you'll learn to use these operators to augment your existing searches and instead of randomly clicking on the first view of millions of results you'll be able to search for fewer higher quality answers while the info in this video is focused on Google as per the title much of it will apply to other popular search engines such as Bing DuckDuckGo Baidu Yahoo Brave kagi and more I'm also going to touch on more specialized and alternative search options towards the end this video does have a programming Ben but I'm going to try and keep it as approachable as possible even if it only offers you a couple new Tools in your search Arsenal this video could have a massive impact on your work simply because of how much you use search stop being a passive web searcher let's get started if you're watching this video you probably use Google a lot but that's pretty easy for me to predict everyone does the average person makes three to four Google searches per day as programmers we're super users often searching anywhere from 2 to 20 times that I certainly fall into that camp personally there are many awesome resources out there stack Overflow medium dev.2 and of course free code Camp which are accessible via a simple search a common misconception is that you're searching the web in reality you're searching Google's index of the web in many ways Google is like the Hub station that connects us to all the different parts of the internet where we hang out for many people that internet is Google and Facebook I'm going to help you understand how Google search works behind the scenes knowing why some sites rank higher than others may help you more effectively find what you're looking for if you're already familiar with how Google search works or more interested in ways that you can phrase search queries feel free to skip to the next part the original algorithm that Google used to order web pages was known as pagerank developed in 1996 by the founders of Google Sergey Brin and Larry Page the concept is basically what if we applied how citations work in Academia to the entire internet in the research world the more citations a paper has the more important and relevant it's considered to be pagerank similarly theorized that many websites would link the most important Pages a concept called backlinks it examines how many quality internal and external links a web page has to estimate its importance if a lot of high quality sites link to some new page that page might be high quality too when this algorithm was applied to a commercial search engine which was originally called backrub it was able to surface results that were more useful to Consumers pagerank is actually public domain even if you're not familiar with some of the math it's a pretty interesting read while pagerank is still considered as a factor when ordering search results today it's not quite the same as in the original paper plus it's now in combination with several other stronger signals so how does this work today here's where your search results currently come from first Google crawls the web that means it algorithmically discovers and compiles new and updated web pages into a massive internal database of millions and billions of sites there's also a few ways search engines like Google can find a new web page such as sending Bots also known as spiders to visit them following links from known Pages people can also submit Pages for Google to index which is called using a site map Google renders the web page during this process which includes running JavaScript in order to ensure that all content is visible and keep track of the information on each web page now that Google has this massive registry of information they need to organize it somehow the content in newly crawled web pages is analyzed and used for indexing if you're familiar with webdev this includes looking at Hidden metadata such as title tags in the HTML Google then tries to filter out low quality content this is really important as the reason you probably keep coming back to Google is because you find it reliably helpful search engines determine the quality of content through signals which are thousands of characteristics of web pages that align with what humans might interpret as high quality or reliable pagerank which I discussed before is one of those signals speed and web vitals are also strongly considered another is rankbrand which uses AI to conduct semantic search or make sense of the connections between links and content and web pages Google stated that rankbrain learns to improve over time and was at least at one point the third most important signal there are also thousands of search quality raters who have the job of ensuring these signals are working as intended after quality filtering Google clusters web pages with similar information one web page is selected to best represent each group of similar Pages this is what you see in the search results Google's algorithm is still somewhat Secret in part because of the Black Box nature of AI and in part to try and avoid people gaming the system so what happens when you search something whenever you enter a query Google does its best to use some of the signals I discussed before and interpret what your search means this can be tricky as like humans search engines have difficulty in identifying things like tone from text alone according to Google it took five years to develop their system for spelling mistakes and synonym matching but it's now used in around thirty percent of searches so I'd say it's probably worth it after Google has an idea of the meaning of your search they then scan their database for the web pages they believe will be most relevant relevancy is influenced by literally hundreds of factors such as your location and language because Google's registry is so massive there will often be millions of results relevant to your search those pages are ranked programmatically based on their relevance and then served to you usually in a few milliseconds let's say I search for science internships some information Google has on me from my last three months of usage my location is at a university I'm studying computer science I read The Verge TechCrunch and free code camp and three of my most visited websites are GitHub free codecamp and stack overflow Google was able to use this context in combination with my query Which is popular from my area and determined that what I actually want to see information on is not science internships but computer science internships and you can actually test how this works from any location now that you have a better idea of how Google serves web pages let's see how you can form better queries time to discuss the ultimate question for getting the most out of Google what should you actually type in the search box how can we take the inordinate number of results and filter them down to what you truly want be thoughtful searching efficiently is about finding the balance between concise and descriptive queries begin with something simple like what is X or how did y depending on the results of your search you can reformat your phrasing use what we learned about how Google works whenever you make a search put yourself in the mindset of the person writing your answer when rephrasing your question consider what words might they include in the title or content of your ideal web page what synonyms or key phrases for instance don't search I'm confused by when I should use semicolons Instead try when to use semicolons or semicolon grammar tips being more precise in your queries usually translates to more relevant results let's say you love to bake how to bake the best apple pie returns 214 Million results a more specific search such as best Dutch apple pie recipe has under 8 million that are closer to what I'm craving as a patient you might search what's the best place to treat heart disease where a more effective search could be best hospital for Pediatric heart transplant and if you're debugging there's dozens of things you can try here still it's possible to be too specific consider what you actually want to learn and avoid including redundant or unnecessary terms in your query let's say I need to know how to execute a piece of code when a widget loads in flutter for a loading screen for example instead of searching flutter async login widget I can search flutter async widget while specifying loading might be more specific it can also cause Google to return fewer quality examples of what I really want to know which is the concept of asynchronous widgets in flutter think about how complex your query is can you break it down into smaller questions try to distill the core issue of your search into the set of terms that you use Google is often more effective when retrieving information for one question at a time watch your words when choosing words to include in a query there's a few things to keep in mind first every word is Meaningful as a single word can make a massive impact on the results you receive for example Dove a Dove d Dove and Dove chocolate will all return very different results in the last case it's very clear you're searching for the chocolate brand but even small words like a or V inform Google that you're not searching for the beauty products to be safe type words that commonly appear next to each other in the way that you'd expect to see them French horn not horn French spelling punctuation and capitalization do not matter free code Camp free code camp in all caps and free code camp and snake case or title case all return the exact same results Sergey Brin once said his goal was for Google to know what you're searching for before you do we haven't yet fully reached that point but it can certainly help you get a question from your head into the search bar a lot faster understanding how Google generates autocompletion can give you an idea of topics similar to what you're researching it can help you complete your queries more quickly Google States their autocomplete future reduces overall typing by around 25 which adds up to about 200 years worth of typing each day predictions are generated by comparing the characters that have been entered with what you've searched before and what other people in your region have searched Google also has systems for predicting portions of a search rather than the entire query their autocomplete engine will automatically shift from one mode to the other let's say you're confused by the complex IOS app development pipeline if you search tutorial for how to install Apple developer certificates Google may help finish the second part of that phrase as an extra tip if you can't remember a word when using autocomplete you can replace it with an underscore as a wildcard word if you want to get more unbiased results you can open up an incognito tab in Chrome that's accomplished with Ctrl shift n this will lock you out of all accounts and enable you to find results without the important influence of your personal search history these tips will hopefully help you ask better questions but even very specific searches can offer millions of results to sift through and the next part I'll discuss how you can pick out the most helpful ones thank you throughout the rest of this video I'm going to cover how to use keywords and operators to filter your results techniques features keyboard shortcuts Etc these will all help you obtain more helpful and relevant results but ultimately determining the most accurate and useful information is going to be up to you many people blindly trust the first three results will be best the number one position on the results page gets a third of all traffic but successful online research requires critical thinking the first search result the first stack Overflow answer those won't always be accurate or helpful let's examine the search results page or serp the one with all the Blue Links each result on the search results page has a title URL and description also known as the abstract snippet as I mentioned before these are ranked by relevance don't stop with the top result instead of randomly flicking on the first few links from the millions of results try this look at the entire page and consider the context surrounding the question you had or the concept you're trying to learn remember what you previously thought your ideal search result would include and it's title word content now see if any of the results on the serp match that info in their titles or descriptions reading results carefully is the most important part of this entire process the descriptions of each result often have relevant bolded terms in them if I search how to audit a class online I'll see the top result has bolded auditing a course if you see words or unfamiliar with in a title or description don't skip that result you can open another Tab and look up the definition and then return to your research another essential tool that Google Engineers recommend for finding an answer or getting a handle on a topic is called lateral browsing when I'm researching a topic or debugging some code I'll often control click on several results at once this will open them in new tabs for me to peruse swapping between is needed to crossreference content when scanning through your search results take note of top level domain names or tlds these are the highest level of abstraction for domain name systems or the DNS and noted as the ending of each domain name tlds are important as a way of gauging reputation authenticity or authority in the United States sites for educational institutions will commonly end with DOT edu this is generally an easy way to identify more reputable sources it also applies for other tlds such as.gov for government websites you can often pick a website's Source based on their domain ending with a country code for instance sites based in Spain might end with es and sites in India often end with Dot in notably you don't need to live in a country to use their country code as a domain ending dot IO meant to refer to sites in the British Indian Ocean territory has been heavily adopted by computer scientists because it can refer to input output and because it sounds cool internationally many tlds combine a country code with endings such as dot geo.br.co.in which are the equivalent of dot gov and.com domains respectively you may come across information while searching the web that you question some info can change significantly based on context if you search for the number of programmers in the world that number will change based on how the source defines a programmer don't accept that anything you read on the Internet is authoritatively accurate Google does their best to filter out Bad actors but stuff slips through the cracks additionally even people with good intentions often make it difficult to verify their statements if I said 73 of programmers go to bed before midnight how can you best confirm that ideally I have provided a source but I didn't so as far as you know I just pulled that number out of my butt who's considered a programmer time zone success so midnight where as an inquisitive person you can start by conducting another search of your own but take care to not include the answer in your query that's an easy way to have confirmation bias if you search for Are there 25 million programmers in the world chances are someone in the world has written down or recorded that statistic you've found it on the web but that doesn't mean the numbers right a search asking JavaScript is the most popular programming language is likely to pull up information saying that yeah people love JavaScript Instead try and write more General openended queries like most popular programming language 2022 or how many programmers in the world a fantastic way to verify information is to find several perspectives if multiple credible sources agree on an answer it's more likely to be correct check to see when content was written and where it's Source from then consider if that makes sense for the subject matter for instance an article about a quote attributed to a person who passed away long before any references connecting the two on the web did you know that the famous line Luke I am your father is different when set in Star Wars the line is actually no I am your father simply searching Luke I am your father will probably pull up this result that you can go deeper by searching for the original script of The Empire Strikes Back reputable sources are really important the new highly cited indicator that appears on sources that are being used as a reference for other news outlets is one feature that helps with this additionally check if a site you've discovered in your research has any reviews or if people have discussed it and forums like Reddit whenever you're reading information ask yourself why might this site not be reputable or trustworthy while forums are incredibly useful since anyone can post take everything set on stack exchange sites and similar sources with a grain of salt Wikipedia though is actually still a fantastic place to start a search because there are usually dozens of curated citations related to your topic to view one of the most important parts of thinking critically while searching the web is asking yourself effective questions is there evidence for this is it always the case what's an alternative viewpoint also ask yourself questions about these questions does that make sense what assumptions do I make can I break this down into smaller questions as humans we're hardwired to dislike information that conflicts with our preexisting beliefs this is one of the trickier aspects of becoming a pro web searcher you need to be willing to accept all answers from trustworthy sources with an open mind even if it makes you feel uncomfortable if you are feeling emotional about an answer conduct another search to confirm its validity but stay skeptical if a piece of information seems sketchy maybe it is it can be worth it to see what conflicts of interest a source may have if a site is backed by a politically motivated or extremist organization it's likely that the authenticity of Journalism of that source is compromised many sites also pretend to be affiliated with a reputable person or organization so always assess whether what you're looking at is actually legitimate an easy way to do that is to do another query searching who owns freecodecamp.org will pull up the name Quincy Larson by reading more about Quincy perhaps by searching who is Quincy Larson I can discover that he is a highly transparent and reputable person without major conflicts of interest but wait this video is published on free codecamp's Channel which means that I could be biased when I said that although I promise you anyone who knows Quincy will back me up that he's amazing still it's important to verify that you can trust not only the platform information is published on but individual authors as well be careful of ellipses and result descriptions sometimes censuses will be cut up in a way that's misleading it's usually a good idea to validate an answer by clicking on the link and reading the original text you can also click on the vertical ellipses next to a search result title to see Google's new about Source feature this will give you information on why Google thought that that result might be relevant for you finally keep in mind that a website's ranking on your search results page is not a reflection of its credibility nutty stuff can be listed as top results if they're relevant to your query similarly anything that shows up as an ad has generally not been evaluated for accuracy by Google now that you're an expert at extracting and validating information from Google search results I'm going to speak about some awesome operators that will power up your queries thank you Google has dozens of features called search operators to improve your searches they're extremely powerful filters and utilities mostly focused on helping you achieve much more specific and relevant results you've probably used several without knowing some are keywords others are special characters they're mostly case insensitive meaning it usually doesn't matter if you capitalize them or not and all can be used anywhere in your query Google is updating these on a regular basis so the list might not be fully comprehensive at the time you're watching I have personally tested them so they should all work at the time of recording let's Dive In any search term or phrase will refine results by attempting to find exact and similar matches by default it will follow the steps I outline when discussing how Google works if you don't want to remember or reference the following search operators every time that you conduct more advanced queries you can visit google.com Advanced underscore search for a simple to use interface foreign matching operators remember that first example I mentioned in this video using double quotes around any term will force Google to match it exactly I find this to be among the most useful operators available let's say you have some specific word or phrase such as an error code or a message you come across while debugging putting quotes around it will cause Google to more accurately find the right stack of report poster GitHub discussion for example quote flutter end quote app development tutorials will only find app development tutorials specific to flutter you can also use double quotes to override spelling auto correction this is especially useful when you're dealing with names with unusual spelling or those that are very close to extremely popular similar searches for instance if you search my name Seth golden you're probably going to get a full page of results for Seth Godin the famous businessman and author by specifying quote Seth golden end quote you'd be able to find my personal site and blog you can also use this for specifying a particular author when searching articles learn from free courses Seth golden in quotes would filter by my name Google will sometimes return results with the term or topic that you don't want it happens the minus operator or exclusion operator when used preceding a word will filter out any results containing that word this is awesome you can use it to easily get rid of all those past keywords that invade your search results because let's say you search for website tutorial but you don't want it to include the framework jQuery you can search website tutorial minus jQuery and exclude jQuery from your results sometimes you just need a wild card the asterisk operator like a diamond Scrabble tile can be used as a standin for literally any word or phrase I often use it to replace words that I've forgotten I can't remember how to spell or generally to speed up a search Linus asterisk Linux so return results on Linus torbolds the creator of git and Linux more quickly than if I spelled out his name given that I provided appropriate context I find the Wild Card operators particularly useful though when debugging often the error message that I'm given contains a local directory that will only be relevant to me instead of pasting that whole block of text into Google replacing that section of the error with an asterisk can significantly improve results this can also be helpful when trying to find relevant walkthroughs for confusing homework questions often we deal with words that have multiple meanings but are used in dramatically different contexts a Blackberry is both a fruit and a cell phone a transistor is a processing unit and a fantastic video game searching by a word's proximity to another word using a round and then a variable number is a highly effective way to narrow results especially when the two words don't often appear right next to each other if Google can't find any examples of the two words around each other it's going to revert to ranking as normal let's say you're looking for a tutorial on managing memory and computer environments manage around for memory is likely to narrow in on those particular results by finding any web page containing an instance of the word manage within four words of the word memory football around 6 ESL will similarly help me fuzzy search for specifically European football instead of the American football results that I would normally see notably this particular operator must be capitalized to function properly next up date operators whether it's finding recent stack Overflow answers or reading a review from the time a movie was released I constantly want results from before or after a specific date you can accomplish this with the before and after operators simply follow either with the date in the format year year month month day day append it to your query and your set for example an error message after 2021 0101 will only return results since January 1st 2021 meaning that I won't have to sit through outdated answers you can also choose to only pass a year such as before 2020 or after 2017. python courses after 2021 would only give you recent courses so that you can be confident that everything's up to date but wait I have a start and an end date in mind well there's two ways you can approach that you can include both a before and after operator in your query or you can use the range operator ellipses you can find info and documentation for a less common programming language such as with closure 2016.2018 you don't just have to use this for dates any numbers will work for example top 7.10 facts Apple Computers will find a top 10 list or top 7 list the ellipses operator can be a little finicky though so don't expect this one to work 100 of the time next up Source operators Google provides several options to filter by content type and source some people joke that Google is a better search engine for Reddit than Reddit amusingly enough I have found this to be often true many sites have periodically ineffective internal search engines including hugely popular ones such as Amazon I also find that sites like Reddit and similar forums can have more trustworthy human responses to my questions than the average first search result so I often choose to filter my results by these sites accordingly site is extraordinarily powerful because it allows you to force Google to only return results from a particular website a pending site colon freecodecamp.org to a query will only return results from free codecamp importantly you can also use sites with the top level domain endings or tlds that I discussed earlier in this video site.edu will restrict your results to purely educational resources such as with berkeley.edu or yale.edu search followed by a website URL accomplishes the same thing in most browsers but I prefer site URL because it's shorter on occasion you'll need to search for PDFs PowerPoints or other documents on the web to force Google to only display results that match a particular file extension you can use EXT or file type which are functionally identical simply follow either with an extension such as txt PDF docs PPT xox CSV ePub Etc in the format file type colon PDF I find this operator is super useful in searching for textbooks academic papers novels presentations and especially anything when relating to academic research unfortunately file type no longer works for MP3 files if you prefer to search the web for news rather than follow 400 RSS feeds like me this Source operator is a great way to specify the site that Google News should pull from for instance Amazon source techcruncher source The Verge GitHub your search results can be extremely different based on your location well Google tries to use your current location by default it's possible that you'll want to specify somewhere else in San Francisco will change my results to be more relevant to the Bay Area even if I'm searching from the East Coast I'm a fan of blogging and reading other people's blogs it's often a more personal and conversational experience about Niche topics of your interest while sub stack and similar providers have Consolidated a lot of bloggers many websites and companies still run their own blogs you can find these through the blog URL operator which attempts to find any blog posts under a domain blog URL google.com will pull out the blogs under Google's registrar it can be a little finicky sometimes though no website is ever able to escape going down every so often you can utilize the cache operator to pull Google's cached or backup saved version of any website for example I can see all of free codecamp's articles even if the site is down by typing cache freecodecamp.org next up Boolean operators Google automatically tries to include all the content within your query so and is best utilized in combination with other operators since it doesn't do anything by itself I'll discuss combining operators in more detail later as I just noted Google searches defaults including everything in your query the or operator is unique from other operators as it causes Google to alter that behavior and increase the number of search results rather than filtering some out using the pipe operator or A or B you can scan for a or b you'll get results related to a or b or importantly both if I'm interested in multiple variants of a data science algorithm I can conduct a search on kmeans or kmeans plus plus to return any result it refers to either the or operator is also useful when searching for something that's known by several names in the American Civil War the Union Soldiers referred to a conflict that took place in Virginia as the Battle of Bull Run but the Confederate soldiers kept their records based on waterways and in their records they called it the battle of Manassas when searching about this topic Battle of Bull Run and battle of Manassas each returns significantly less information than Battle of Bull Run or battle of Manassas as I noted before make sure you capitalize or or Google might not recognize it as an operator next up the in operators these operators can be used to massively narrow your search results based on the content included in my page metadata if you're unfamiliar with web dev by metadata I mean the URL or website link and internal information such as the page title content and anchors each of these operators has two versions an in option and an allin option the results for both will be similar but all in will only return results containing all of the following terms they both help to ensure that the words you're looking for will actually be present on the pages returned as results websites will often put important information in the URL of web pages you can use in url tutorial to only return tutorials or all in url tutorial python app for more specificity remember how the file type operator no longer works for filtering Out MP3 files you can actually use the in url operator as a substitute such as searching for LoFi in url MP3 the title of a web page is one of the best ways to tell how relevant it will be to you in title flutter will only return websites that refer to flutter while all in title flutter app tutorial will have fewer hits the keyword you're looking for isn't always included in the title or URL in those cases intext and all in text will have more benefit anchors are often invisible linkable section headers of web pages they're usually indicated by hashtags such as hashtag hero or hashtag testimonials in anchor and all in Anchor will help you identify web pages with such tags notably these inclusion search operators are often best used in combination with each other they help you extract web pages that might not have been surfaced otherwise finally Google provides many utility operators that you can use to quickly access all kinds of data I use these all the time wondering what a word means Define and then the word will tell you using Google's builtin dictionary it'll likely display in a side panel along with synonyms Define entrepreneurship will quickly pull up the definition and you don't even need to be able to spell the word properly related is one of the more interesting operators the Google offers it returns websites that are similar to The Following domain in the format related colon and then the web page URL it's useful for breadth of research particularly when trying to learn something for instance related freecodecamp.org will return sites like codeacademy.org coursera.org Etc need to check your public IP address the unique identifier that allows your computer to receive information just enter IP address and Google can display what it identifies as your public Internet Protocol do you know how many pounds are in a kilogram off the top of your head or how to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius or how many milliliters are in a quart by using the format X in y Google can swiftly tell you for example 456 dollars in euros will tell me that 456 dollars is at the time of recording 434.45 in euros online shopping is huge right now chances are you probably search Google to see different places that offer your item of interest if you're looking for a specific price you can search 300 with the dollar sign Android and Google will attempt to match that you can also apply the range operator here and search keyboard dollar sign 10 dot dot dot dollar sign 50. looking for a social media account of a friend or content creator instead of searching their name prepend an at symbol to their social media handle to more effectively pull up all their social accounts want to immediately know the weather for any location you can just search the word weather for your location but to specify others append the location like weather colon Bangkok while you might use apps like Google or Apple Maps or ways for your mapping needs sometimes you'll need to search for One while it Returns the current location by default you can specify a particular location like map colon London there's a new movie out and you want to go see it while searching the movie titles usually enough to pull it up if it's based on a book or something similar your search might not pull up exactly what you want using movie Avengers endgame is then a foolproof way to get a lot of info about any film including reviews cast and crew and nearby show times fintech person you can see all the stonks for any ticker by searching stocks colon and then the appropriate ticker such as stocks colon Amazon for immediate information about the price history of Amazon there are several other tools you can access straight from Google's search bar if you type any math equation Google will automatically calculate the answer if you ever need an ondemand clock type timer or stopwatch to pull one up or type X minute timer to automatically start one search for flip a coin or roll a die when you need to cast a stitch in time or any other situation when generating a probability is necessary you can also pull up a quick reference tip calculator with tip calculator this calculator feature can also be useful for very important factoids like the number of horns on a unicorn and the probability of once in a blue moon together you can use these utilities to more quickly access everyday information while they may not be as essential in the software world they're still going to help you make better searches in your daytoday life foreign these are a lot of tools that you can utilize to filter your searches and operators become even more powerful when you're able to combine them effectively for example how to build an asterisk app site colon freecodecamp.org minus flutter will give me results on any kind of app tutorial except letter on free codecamp containing the name Quincy Larson another helpful combination could include the site and URL and exclusion operators you can search site colon freecodecamp.org minus in url blog to get all the subdomains except blogs or you can find insecure pages on a website using site colon domainname.com where you fill in the appropriate domain name minus in URL https I find combining the wild card and exact match operators to be very useful quote python asterisk tutorial end quote will return any results with python and tutorial in that order with anything in between for example python app tutorial the wildcard operator is also very easy to include with other operators such as site and numerl you can use parentheses to power up your combinations of operators I commonly use these when grouping for order of operations with Boolean operators like or or when using synonyms if I want to specify a bunch of synonyms when searching for a resume I can do that keep in mind that the pipe operator or or operator are functionally identical Google processes and and or operators in a logical order make sure to use parentheses when necessary for instance Python and parentheses JavaScript or typescript parentheses will be interpreted as looking for results including Python and either JavaScript or typescript alternatively Python and JavaScript or pipe script will return results with python and JavaScript or results with just typescript not in any way related to python let's say I'm looking for tutorials on the language closure by linking together search operators I'm able to form a query which gives me only about a hundred highly focused results there are practically endless number of combinations of search operators I encourage you to consider what will be most beneficial for your search and mix and match accordingly foreign next few parts I'm going to discuss several features specialized search options and search related tools that you might find helpful since you've used Google you're familiar with how to search for images just type in some keywords click on the images tab and voila but what if you already have the image or in front of it and you need to figure out what it is or where it's from Google image search and Google Lens are two powerful tools to accomplish that you can access reverse image search by clicking the camera icon or visiting images.google.com upload or drag your image into the search bar and it will scan the web for images that look similar for instance I have this image of some phones and a yellow background that I pulled off of unsplash and used in a blog post I can upload it to reverse image search and see all the other websites that are using it as part of their articles these include five ways the original iPhone was ahead of its time Apple now has one billion active iPhones around the world and these are the top four highest selling iPhones of all time I can also filter for other sizes of the image and photos that are similar plus you can use the color drop down menu under search tools to filter photos by color transparency picture size and animation effect to find that perfect gif this also works for faces clip art and line drawings reverse image search is useful if you already have a photo and you're sitting at a computer but what if there's something right in front of you that you want to learn about perhaps a product you'd like to find online or a location you're at Google lens is an awesome relatively new feature which debuted in 2017 and identifies objects in your camera lens in real time here I'm using it to take a picture of my desktop speakers Google Lens quickly identifies their Logitech speakers and pulls up search results of their pricing and availability you can use Google Lens to search for homework help or excerpts of books online and copy text from physical documents similar to Apple's live text feature I'm a particular fan of their realtime translate function I can point my camera at a menu in a foreign language and receive a version in my preferred language these image search options may be more helpful in your daily life than for software development but they're incredibly useful tools to have in your search Arsenal thank you everything that Google indexes is known as the visible web but sometimes you need to delve deeper this is usually because of the long tail many people treat Google as the allencompassing internet if you can't find it on Google it simply does not exist but that's not entirely the case before anything else make sure the reason you're not seeing any results isn't just what you searched a lot of times the issue is information retrieval not the indexing of the information in the first place if you have a hyperspecific query every word that you've added makes it more likely that you've excluded results try broadening your search and it's possible the way you're looking for will pop up while Google tries their best to index everything that can be useful the web is a large and complex place and Google's best efforts to fight spam content can be missed that may be important in more Niche scenarios seen in things like their indexing of large websites with too many subdirectories or subdomains and attempting to cut back on duplicate content Google has in some cases completely wiped content off their serps sites like GitHub or offenders here where some repositories can no longer be found on Google because they're old or unused but while Google's better than ever for the majority of searches and Niche cases When there's less data to work with you could even find nothing in these cases you'll want to consider trying alternative search options and specialize in the area that you're looking for Google actually provides a few of its own for more Niche areas Google Scholar is a massive collection of scholarly literature from the global scientific community and it is an amazing research for serious research it is primarily made up of papers published in respective journals spanning everything from biology to Neuroscience to machine learning and natural language processing to Legal opinions it also includes scholarly sites and content from universities Scholars particularly useful when conducting more thorough research on an academic topic with some major perks over traditional search to start it provides links that direct to the full version of scholarly articles books and reports scholar enables you to see the number of citations papers have where they're published and any related authors or Affiliated institutions it also has builtin options to copy citations and export bibliographies in formal MOA APA bibtex format you can even dive deeper into individual authors and view their aggregate work it's similar to other academic search engines such as papers with code web of Science and scopus while the process of entering a query is the same as with normal search the results page is a little bit different if I search natural language processing you can see that the result blocks now each contain bibliographic info this includes the title of the article The Source the author or authors when it was published and who it was published by some results will even have options to see the abstract or even download the full document as a PDF the version you see in Google Scholar may not always be the final paper Google does its best to show the newest freely available version which often means a preprint adding a year restricting by a date range in your search can be very useful in getting more recent findings try and make use of some of the operators we discussed before including and or exclusion and exact match operators for instance Neuroscience author quote Seth golden end quote 2022 will pull up my recent paper on analyzing em images or quote machine learning unquote minus medicine minus biology will return results or ml papers that don't have it to do with those sub areas Google Scholar is not infallible citation data is often not fully comprehensive or up to date using the verification skills that I discussed earlier try to check out the original publisher as well to check your findings Google also supports a powerful patent search available at patents.google.com you can search Google Patent Search or Google patents advanced search on Google for more options and filters using this tool you can find information on patents searching by title number inventor signee and more Google currently keeps track of patents in North America Europe and Japan it's a great resource for anyone researching patent information which may not be readily available in a general search thank you if you're unfamiliar with common browser keybinds I'll share a few these are generally the same across all browsers and massively increased productivity replace control with command and ALT with option if you're using Mac OS as I mentioned in part 3 control click opens a link in a new tab control T opens a new tab control W closes the current tab control shift F or alt F focuses the search bar control R refreshes the page Control Alt R hard refreshes the page from origin and Ctrl F searches for text within a web page this last one is super critical to efficient searching I constantly use control F to find the content that I'm seeking on a web page it saves tons of time that I'd otherwise spend skimming information that's potentially unrelated to what I'm looking for knowing these keyboard shortcuts will hopefully help you navigate the browser and complete searches faster foreign congrats you're now all powered up and ready to go and get the most out of Google that puts you ahead of most of the other 27 million developers in the world was that statistic real try and search for yourself I encourage you to consider how you can combine everything that I've discussed in this video to obtain the best answer to your question start with a simple search use specific terms to narrow Focus but avoid unnecessary or redundant terms put yourself in the mindset of the person writing your answer break down multipart queries into several searches verify your results browse laterally use search operators and take advantage of specialized search engines searches will sometimes be simple other times you'll be deep in the weeds online detective work can be hard my last and most important piece of advice don't give up it might take two searches or three or six rephrase your query and try again you have access to all of human knowledge take advantage of it thank you for listening to this video course I hope it was of some help to you after finishing this course do you feel like your approach search differently I want to thank the amazing people at free code Camp who supported the development of this course additionally my appreciation goes out to Google search intern Eric bozen Lincoln Baxter and several Google Engineers who requested their names remain private for reviewing the course material and helping me make it the best possible That's all folks
