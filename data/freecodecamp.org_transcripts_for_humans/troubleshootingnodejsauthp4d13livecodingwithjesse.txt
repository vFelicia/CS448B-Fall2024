00:07 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:10 - with Jessie and today we're going to try
00:15 - to get the authorization working the
00:20 - user login for our app and so I've done
00:25 - some troubleshooting today and I think
00:27 - I've ruled out the the email as the
00:31 - issue so yesterday we were thinking that
00:34 - there was maybe a port that was blocked
00:37 - that was stopping emails from working
00:39 - but that's not the case so I was able to
00:42 - test that out and on the master branch I
00:46 - don't have the login implemented but the
00:51 - email is there when you submit the form
01:00 - that I was going to show you but I can't
01:02 - log in right now so if we could log in
01:05 - there's a form all right so we can get
01:08 - to it on the master branch I can submit
01:11 - it successfully and I can get the email
01:13 - so that works so it's not the email so
01:16 - we have to look elsewhere so I did kind
01:21 - of scatter i scattered console logs all
01:25 - over the place throughout some of our
01:28 - node files here and I didn't I didn't
01:36 - come up with any definitive but I think
01:40 - it may have something to do with the
01:43 - database connection let me show you my
01:48 - my logs here so this is what I keep
01:51 - getting
01:57 - let's see here we go so this this error
02:01 - is is coming from client dot J s
02:05 - that's the area that I keep getting
02:07 - every time I try to log in so between
02:13 - what I was able to do with all the
02:14 - console logs and be able to successfully
02:18 - send emails and this error message that
02:22 - leads me to believe that maybe it has
02:24 - something to do with how we're
02:26 - interacting with with that database so I
02:29 - figure that's not a bad place to start
02:31 - with our troubleshooting
02:35 - so let's it was not much to see here
02:40 - just you know we can submit see actually
02:48 - let me restart this because we're not
02:54 - gonna get this will refresh
03:19 - all right let me check the live chat
03:21 - before we get started and then I'll
03:23 - start my timer and we'll do 25 minutes
03:26 - of in this case troubleshooting we may
03:29 - or not may or may not be writing that
03:32 - much code so you could see this is this
03:36 - is what happens when you submit we just
03:37 - keep getting the same error sorry it's
03:46 - just everything set up hey everybody
03:50 - CEO saying hey air in the live chat
04:00 - sebastian is asking if the the pool
04:04 - request he submitted to fix that UI
04:06 - glitch that was happening with the the
04:08 - drop down for to log out so i did emerge
04:15 - in that pool request i as far as i know
04:22 - it was working alright i didn't have
04:24 - time to test it that much so it was only
04:28 - really minimal changes just to CSS so i
04:32 - figured there's no harm in and merging
04:34 - it in but my take truth my browser stack
04:38 - has been insanely slow lately so if
04:43 - you're not familiar browser stack you
04:45 - can run you can test your websites on
04:48 - all different types of browser operating
04:53 - system device combinations so it's like
04:57 - you through your browser you can log in
05:01 - to these other devices and test it so
05:03 - for whatever reason it's just been
05:05 - really weird and slow and hard to test
05:08 - so i didn't test it yet just because I'm
05:09 - tired of the frustration of working with
05:12 - that
05:12 - so anyway it's it's in the master branch
05:16 - now so if anyone once has the code on
05:21 - your machine and you're running an on
05:23 - Mac please let me know if you see
05:26 - anything weird when you click on that
05:29 - that menu to
05:31 - logout but I think it should be fun
05:51 - okay
06:00 - all right so I have some some comments
06:03 - pertaining to the troubleshooting so
06:06 - let's just go right into that and and
06:08 - check out these comments I'm going to
06:10 - start my timer after this 25 minutes is
06:13 - up I'm going to take five minutes and go
06:15 - through the questions in the live chat
06:17 - so if you ask a question I will get to
06:20 - it eventually just hang in there and and
06:24 - you'll get your answer if you can't
06:25 - stick around for the answer just check
06:28 - out the recording of this video which
06:30 - will be available here on the free code
06:32 - camp YouTube channel
06:33 - shortly after I finished the stream
06:37 - alright so okay so Paco asks did you try
06:45 - to connect your mom go on another port
06:51 - okay no I haven't let's see and Harshit
06:59 - is asking about a user I've already
07:02 - created a user in the in the
07:05 - database so I'm using M lab just the
07:13 - free version of M lab just to set up a
07:16 - testing database so I do have a user
07:21 - created and that's the the user that I'm
07:26 - working with for for my database so
07:33 - where you have to put in your database
07:34 - user and password that's that's what I
07:37 - am using
07:46 - okay Sebastian followed up with
07:50 - initially talking about pull requests
07:52 - yes the white space was gone so there's
07:56 - no white space any there anymore they're
07:58 - on a Mac so that that issue was cleared
08:01 - up so thank you
08:33 - let's see
08:53 - okay so I'm trying to I'm trying to sort
08:56 - out Harshit is the one that that coded
09:00 - this pretty much everything having to do
09:04 - with the back end was done by Harsha so
09:07 - I'm trying to read these comments
09:10 - helping me out here so so harsh it's
09:16 - saying check your dot and file okay so
09:19 - what what do I need to check the string
09:22 - I have checked the string it's it's
09:25 - worth double-checking okay I should
09:30 - saying to use use his connection string
09:35 - okay let's see I have my dot M file open
09:45 - on my other screen obviously so that I
09:52 - don't show everybody all my stuff
10:01 - to
10:04 - okay cool so harsh it's going to message
10:07 - me the info so that I can I can try it
10:12 - with with his database info that's
10:15 - actually a good idea and then that old
10:17 - that should help us narrow down the
10:20 - issue
10:47 - okay so let me see while I'm waiting on
10:50 - on a Harsha - send me that info okay
10:55 - cool I just got it
10:57 - anyway I was going to say when we
11:00 - probably later on whenever I finish up
11:04 - with the coding and we do a question and
11:06 - answer session I'm gonna let you know
11:07 - how everything went with that react
11:09 - native that just to make a lungs long
11:14 - story short it passed the code review so
11:18 - it's officially accepted I've completed
11:19 - all the project for that nano degree
11:21 - which is awesome
11:23 - there's definitely a lot of work that I
11:25 - still would like to do on it and I got
11:27 - some really great feedback from my
11:29 - reviewers so I maybe I might actually
11:33 - turn that into some issues on the github
11:36 - repo and then if anybody would like to
11:37 - work on it with me then at least you'll
11:40 - know some of the things that need the
11:45 - need work alright so I got Harshit I got
11:48 - your your info I'm going to paste that
11:52 - now into my dot and file
12:08 - okay I'm saving that and let me let me
12:17 - restart this so you start this wait for
12:25 - that to refresh
12:33 - okay alright let's give this a shot now
12:59 - okay so waiting
13:08 - okay not sent let's see yep we got the
13:12 - same same error
13:24 - okay so since this same login info works
13:28 - for Harshit on his machine then it's
13:33 - probably it probably doesn't have
13:35 - anything to do with my my login
13:37 - credentials for the database it has
13:42 - something to do I guess with my
13:45 - development environment so well at least
13:50 - we've we've ruled that out okay
14:32 - okay hard sing hard code the string for
14:35 - now okay I can hard code it I will I'll
14:40 - do that on my other screen let's see
14:49 - actually let me yeah
15:16 - okay
15:23 - oops
15:35 - we
15:38 - first that
15:50 - okay still same there well almost the
15:59 - same we had a bit more up here the last
16:00 - time
16:02 - Eric connecting the TV
16:13 - interesting
16:20 - I'm going to try that one more time I'm
16:23 - just wondering why we got different
16:25 - messages
16:38 - okay
16:50 - okay
17:05 - hmm
17:25 - all right
17:37 - I'm gonna get off of this I don't want
17:39 - that off day Esther refresh and show
17:42 - harsh it's trying to use memory store
17:48 - for now I'll different Express session
17:57 - okay physically listen reacts yeah so
18:01 - dragon hunter the the repo is bulletin
18:05 - react
18:08 - okay so harsh is saying try to use a
18:11 - memory store for now from Express
18:15 - session okay you're gonna have to help
18:18 - me out with that because I've this is
18:20 - the first time I've used and
18:23 - Express so let's see
18:34 - okay so I'm going to remove i'll go from
18:37 - exposition
18:46 - I make that big here sorry that was
18:49 - probably too small for everybody
18:51 - I had it smaller earlier there we go
18:56 - okay okay so harsh the same I'm removing
19:02 - so I'm not sure exactly where to remove
19:05 - if if I remove this will that do the
19:07 - trick are there other places where I
19:09 - need to remove it from I'm gonna take
19:19 - that out now and I figured I'd get some
19:27 - sort of error okay so first we remove
19:35 - that okay cool
19:50 - okay so there's another place where we
19:52 - have to do this that's okay dragon
19:57 - hunter the branch someone right now is
19:59 - it's actually harsh it's pull request
20:05 - let me let me send you what PR is that
20:10 - 44 let me send you the get command I'm
20:15 - going to take by the gate command if
20:16 - anybody does want to check this out
20:17 - but you're not familiar with how to do
20:19 - this I'm just going to type it right
20:20 - into the live chat it's get fetch origin
20:27 - pull 44 and then age okay so get fetch
20:45 - origin pool and then 44 I'll put this up
20:49 - on the screen too if anybody wants to
20:50 - see this later on so this is what I'm
20:54 - doing git fetch origin pool so you're
20:57 - gonna pull request number 44 and then
21:00 - head and then at the end here you can
21:02 - name this whatever you want but that's
21:03 - what the branch is going to be called on
21:05 - your local machine so this is what I
21:06 - named it on my local machine but you can
21:09 - name it whatever you want after you pull
21:11 - this down you can switch to that branch
21:13 - make sure you run npm install or yarn
21:16 - because there's a lot of packages and
21:19 - then you should be able to to work on on
21:24 - this or at least follow follow along
21:27 - with what we're doing
21:34 - okay all right so let me go back to this
21:39 - John Hanson says I remember seeing
21:41 - something when using react with express
21:43 - and connecting through MongoDB there can
21:46 - be a shared connection issue between
21:47 - Express and react which can default on
21:50 - the same localhost 3000 okay so maybe
21:54 - maybe we're dealing with with a known
21:57 - issue here that's good to know because
21:59 - there'll probably be some some
22:02 - information about how how to fix it down
22:06 - let DVD compass see where was let
22:14 - me let me go back one so there was one
22:17 - other thing that I had to comment out
22:27 - well let's connect to the database from
22:29 - a GUI first okay
22:42 - we compass
23:13 - be able to
23:21 - could I use instead of compass the bongo
23:26 - DB compass could I just use the command
23:28 - line could I use the shell let me pull
23:42 - pull one over to my other screen here
24:09 - Harshit saying it will be very hard as
24:11 - you don't have longer that well wedding
24:14 - we should I mean all we really need to
24:17 - test is whether or not I can actually
24:20 - connect right so that that might be the
24:27 - only reason I'm asking is because I
24:28 - don't want to go through the to get the
24:32 - free version of Compass TV
24:37 - compass is like you gotta fill out all
24:41 - your contact info and everything so I
24:43 - was just going to try to avoid that and
24:46 - I wanted to download the show anyway
24:55 - oh here we go found another place where
24:57 - it's gonna let me download it without
24:59 - that alright I'll try that then I don't
25:01 - know what that other page was but it
25:03 - wanted a lot of contact info okay oh
25:09 - yeah now it's making me do this again
25:33 - I'm gonna show
25:41 - so I'm trying to install the shell
25:44 - but the the documentation page was just
25:48 - saying how to use it and not how to
25:49 - install it
26:30 - cool I think I could just use brew to
26:33 - install this let's see
26:59 - okay so I'm gonna try to use homebrew
27:01 - homebrew to install this
27:12 - okay cool let's see
27:19 - all right harsh dude I got your link I'm
27:21 - going to open this on my other screen
27:27 - okay so if you're just joining us you're
27:29 - not sure what's going on when installing
27:31 - some tools to help us test our database
27:34 - connection so I have a few things going
27:42 - right now so whatever tool ends up
27:45 - getting downloaded faster is what we're
27:48 - going to use
28:11 - all right so the compass is has
28:15 - three minutes left on the download
28:16 - homebrew is now about 15% done
28:21 - downloading so
28:33 - so we'll see see what happens it's a
28:36 - race so if you've never used homebrew
28:42 - here's what's going on here so if you're
28:45 - on a Mac you can use homebrew to install
28:47 - packages so there are different reasons
28:50 - why you might want to use home homebrew
28:52 - but it can be it can be useful so I just
28:58 - ran brew update which just updated
29:00 - homebrew it's good good there if you
29:04 - don't run homebrew often it's a good
29:06 - idea to just do a brew update every time
29:08 - you're going to install something new
29:09 - and then I'm doing brew install MongoDB
29:11 - so waiting on that looks like it's still
29:16 - saying three minutes left on the
29:18 - Compass something like the the home brew
29:25 - install might might win the race here
29:28 - okay let's see
29:39 - [Music]
29:42 - harsh harsh is saying check out all
29:44 - changes you might have done some
29:46 - breaking change is possible all I really
29:50 - added in were console logs and I think I
29:52 - actually got rid of all those so it
29:55 - should be everything should be exactly
29:58 - the same
29:59 - I can always pull the pull the branch
30:05 - down again
30:22 - sirrah mad
30:36 - okay
30:39 - all right so now we reverted all right
30:44 - so we do have Brian's asking about
30:46 - homebrew so while we're waiting for this
30:48 - to install we may as well talk about
30:50 - number so homebrew helps you it's been a
30:55 - while since I even read anything about
30:57 - homebrew but from what I remember when I
31:01 - was first researching this homebrew who
31:04 - helps you use C you install these
31:09 - packages but you do it in a way that
31:11 - protects your system so I don't know if
31:13 - sandboxing is the right word but I guess
31:20 - it's it's somewhat similar to that also
31:23 - it makes it easier really easy to update
31:25 - things so like if you install yarn
31:28 - through homebrew and you want to update
31:30 - yarn you just run the update through
31:33 - homebrew so there's no sometimes yarn
31:37 - for whatever reason can be tricky at
31:39 - least I've it's been tricky for me
31:41 - probably because on some of my scenes I
31:43 - use homebrew and some of machines I use
31:45 - I installed it other ways so anyway I'm
31:50 - gonna do my 5-minute break now and I'll
31:52 - just continue talking about homebrew for
31:54 - a minute here but it just kind of makes
31:59 - it easy to be able I mean you can see a
32:01 - lot of the packages here that are
32:03 - available
32:06 - this kind of simplifies installing
32:10 - packages you know you don't have to go
32:11 - like read the docs on how to manually
32:13 - install any of these it just it's there
32:15 - and it works so anyway I don't use it
32:20 - for everything but it is convenient for
32:23 - some things all right let me scroll up
32:27 - and see what questions you all have and
32:32 - try to answer as many as I can here in
32:34 - this little break
32:46 - Oh Goo's says I can't learn vanilla
32:50 - JavaScript could you guys help me yeah I
32:57 - would say if you're having trouble with
32:59 - vanilla JavaScript I mean you can
33:00 - certainly ask any questions here in the
33:02 - live chat or you know ask me questions
33:05 - on Twitter or something like that but I
33:09 - think checking out free code camps
33:15 - javascript exercises is a good way to
33:17 - get your hang of get the hang of all the
33:20 - syntax and run through some algorithms
33:22 - and things there are other great
33:24 - resources so code Academy has some nice
33:28 - like in browser tutorials and there's
33:32 - certainly a lot of YouTube videos
33:34 - there's a great JavaScript series here
33:37 - on free code camps channel that that Bo
33:40 - recorded so you know check that out
33:43 - there's also some good open source books
33:46 - so the you don't know J S series is
33:50 - available for free on github that's a
33:52 - great series so there's a lot of
33:54 - different things you could do to learn
33:56 - JavaScript it kind of depends on your
33:58 - preferred learning style I would say for
34:02 - me things I like the videos and I like
34:05 - reading and all that and the in browser
34:08 - exercises but I don't feel like I really
34:10 - get them the concepts and so I start to
34:13 - use it in my own projects and and need
34:15 - to modify things you know based on the
34:17 - project requirements then I find myself
34:20 - really getting the hang of these
34:22 - different concepts so no matter what you
34:24 - do to learn at first I would try to
34:27 - spend some time every day just you know
34:30 - a little bit of time every day actually
34:31 - using those concepts if you can it'll be
34:34 - much easier to keep those learn those
34:37 - concepts and remember them if you do a
34:39 - little bit every day as opposed to you
34:41 - know maybe taking one day a week and
34:43 - spending hours learning so that's that's
34:47 - just kind of some basic advice if you're
34:51 - having issues with a specific part of
34:54 - JavaScript you know that
34:56 - you know or let us know here in the live
34:58 - chat and I mean we could help you with
35:00 - that okay Blake asked about end rock at
35:13 - the beginning and Rock is the the
35:16 - service that I'm using to be able to let
35:20 - you all see on your computer in your
35:23 - browser the projects that I'm working on
35:25 - locally and you can inspect them however
35:29 - it's not really going to be of that much
35:31 - use right now because of the way we have
35:33 - the servers running so we will be using
35:37 - it in the future but for right now it's
35:42 - not it's not really gonna work and it
35:47 - has nothing to do with n grog and rocks
35:49 - working perfectly it's just what we have
35:51 - one on right now with the project
35:54 - Fernando says I'm from Argentina
35:57 - I need a job
36:02 - Fernando let's see if you if you're on
36:07 - Twitter and you wanna if you send me a
36:13 - tweet with I'm sorry if you tagged me in
36:16 - a tweet that maybe has a link to your
36:20 - github repository or your portfolio
36:22 - website and just saying the tweet like
36:25 - you know I'm looking for work this is
36:27 - what I do I'd be happy to retweet you I
36:29 - don't have that many followers I'm like
36:32 - just under 600 right now but maybe some
36:35 - of my followers may retweet as well and
36:37 - some of my followers do have a lot more
36:40 - followers on their account so that may
36:43 - help I don't I don't know of any jobs
36:44 - available right now and I'm not really
36:46 - in a position to make hiring decisions
36:48 - on my own where I'm working right now
36:51 - but I'd be more than happy to just try
36:53 - to get your name out there on Twitter a
36:55 - little bit more so my link to my Twitter
37:01 - account or at least my name on Twitter
37:03 - is is in the description for this video
37:08 - okay
37:19 - all right so that time is up let's do
37:22 - one more session hopefully we can get
37:25 - things something figured out in this
37:27 - session so let me scroll back down and
37:30 - let me grab let's see I have all my
37:34 - database info open on another screen so
37:40 - let me grab this and paste this in here
37:55 - okay all right so now that I have the
37:58 -  shell I'm going to let me get all
38:11 - the all the info in here just to just
38:17 - take me just a second I'm going to I'm
38:20 - going to build the string that I need to
38:22 - put in there on my other screen and then
38:27 - I'll paste it into the terminal
39:17 - okay so I'm not I'm not going to do this
39:21 - on the screen I'm doing some another
39:22 - screen because I have all my database
39:24 - info in here but right now it's it's in
39:29 - the process of connecting so let's see
39:32 - what happens I don't know how long it
39:34 - normally takes to connect
39:48 - okay actually interesting okay so we I
39:56 - did get by an error that gives me a
39:59 - little bit more information here
40:12 - hmm
40:18 - okay so is definitely the problem I
40:23 - think is with connecting to the database
40:25 - let's see oh there's a lot of capital
40:30 - letters in the live chat right now so
40:32 - let's see what har should say okay so
40:36 - harsh is saying that we should run a
40:39 - local database all right so let's do
40:44 - this
40:52 - start dB
41:00 - okay
41:35 - okay all right so we've started MongoDB
41:42 - let's see
41:50 - changing to mondo vocalist bulletin
42:08 - okay
42:24 - all right let's whoops
42:35 - okay so let me let me repeat what's
42:42 - going on in the live chat here sorry I
42:44 - think I've been pretty silent trying to
42:46 - read this so for everybody they can't
42:48 - see the live chat so what we're going to
42:52 - try to do is locally run a database so
42:55 -  DB which we can do now since we
42:58 - installed everything so we're going to
43:03 - start this so we've run on my other
43:05 - screen I guess I could pull this over
43:07 - now because I don't have any special
43:14 - there we go okay so let me the the zoom
43:21 - one i therm is a little odd but anyway
43:27 - alright so I was pasting the wrong stuff
43:29 - in here but basically an R should let me
43:33 - know so I did Bruce services start
43:35 - MongoDB and it started a database and
43:38 - then I mistakenly pasted this in here
43:41 - before I saw your comment about where to
43:43 - put that so let's
43:57 - yeah okay so I've done the brewery
44:01 - services start MongoDB and I'm gonna put
44:08 - I'm going to change the dot n file
44:30 - okay so I've changed the database in the
44:35 - dot M file all right now let's restart
44:41 - the server whoops
44:42 - I have it here
44:45 - oh no sorry start this up rates alright
44:59 - as soon as this refreshes we'll test it
45:00 - out
45:09 - okay I'm seeing some hopeful things in
45:12 - the console yes I hate okay so it says
45:18 - the email has been sent
45:19 - let me verify that I have my email upon
45:23 - on the other screen and yes okay I have
45:26 - the token and let me grab this token and
45:32 - we'll paste it in over here so everyone
45:34 - can see awesome
45:40 - all right really cool so let me recap
45:44 - just I guess I didn't need to zoom in
45:49 - that much but let's recap would just
45:52 - happen
45:53 - so our it seems that our whole problem
45:55 - for the last or at least not not our
45:58 - problem it works your Harshit right away
46:00 - but for me for some reason and possibly
46:03 - this has to do with with my network here
46:05 - although I did try it on another network
46:08 - so maybe it's not I'm not sure what the
46:10 - issue is but for whatever reason we
46:16 - couldn't connect to the database that I
46:18 - was trying to run through a service
46:19 - called M lab so instead we installed
46:24 -  with homebrew and then we just
46:28 - started up locally a database then I
46:32 - replace the local database in our DB
46:37 - hosts and our dot M file and that's the
46:40 - dot n files where you put information
46:42 - that you want to pull in as variables
46:44 - but you want to keep that secret so you
46:46 - don't put the dot end file in your
46:48 - github repo and nobody ever sees that
46:51 - okay get it it allows you to pull that
46:54 - into your source code but it remains
46:58 - hidden and you can still have things in
47:01 - your repository on github and you don't
47:05 - have to risk exposing API keys or
47:09 - passwords or anything like that so
47:11 - anyway so we changed our den file and
47:14 - then we're able to connect to the
47:15 - database so the authorization works as
47:21 - stated and you know exactly how how it
47:25 - was supposed to work so thanks harsh it
47:26 - great job on that so awesome
47:33 - well this is awesome so what I wanted
47:37 - let's let's test some of this out right
47:42 - great so you see we were able to log in
47:45 - let's check out let's check out where
47:49 - this is being stored at you have this on
47:54 - local storage or in cookies
48:19 - cool
48:21 - all right so okay heart should say we
48:28 - should test the form submission - that's
48:30 - a good idea so the form submission was
48:33 - working before let's test it again just
48:35 - to make sure I'm just gonna put some
48:38 - things in here and submit all right
48:41 - submitted let's double check my email
48:45 - yep I got it
48:47 - actually let's try to do that with a
48:49 - file as well so let's see let's send so
49:03 - I'm gonna send something okay this is
49:08 - reasonably thin this is something that a
49:11 - PDF is something something we'll
49:13 - probably get sent frequently so all
49:18 - right and
49:33 - okay cool when the attachment did come
49:35 - through great
49:47 - awesome okay okay so all that works all
49:55 - right so we may as well merge this now
49:58 - so let's go back to our our console and
50:03 - what I'm gonna do first and I always do
50:07 - this always do this when I have branches
50:13 - that I'm merging is first we're going to
50:15 - merge master into our other branch and
50:19 - then if something really goes wrong at
50:21 - least we haven't messed up our master
50:23 - branch right so let's do get merge
50:29 - master all right why are you up to date
50:32 - I actually merged beforehand so I was
50:35 - almost positive that was going to work
50:37 - sometimes you may have merged conflicts
50:40 - in this case there was there was nothing
50:42 - harsh it does a good job of keeping
50:44 - everything merged so anyway let's go
50:49 - let's do a git checkout master up master
50:57 - and now we'll get merge h off great okay
51:05 - let me just double check we should be
51:07 - all up to date with our packages but
51:09 - never hurts to run it again great we are
51:13 - up to date and now we'll do a git push
51:15 - origin master all right that's going to
51:18 - push our code up to github and then if
51:20 - anybody happens to be looking at this
51:21 - pull request it will change from open to
51:24 - merge whenever we do this so we don't
51:26 - even have to do anything in github right
51:31 - from the command line it's it's going to
51:32 - be taken care of all right great
51:39 - okay now here's the thing though we
51:47 - there's some things that will probably
51:50 - change just so that we can all work on
51:53 - this and test it out so for instance
51:55 - right now you have to put in a
51:56 - Franciscan University email address
52:00 - now granted you could have it sent to
52:03 - mail trap so like there are ways but I
52:06 - think it's it's probably a good idea to
52:09 - make some changes hopefully I can get
52:11 - those changes done today probably not
52:12 - doing the stream just to make it
52:15 - possible I guess to skip the login since
52:21 - we know it works basically so y'all can
52:23 - get in and you're locally on your
52:26 - machines and do you know check out other
52:28 - things and do other type of work so
52:30 - we'll see about that so for now just be
52:33 - aware that it's going to make you log in
52:35 - now if you try to download this okay so
52:41 - let me bring over I guess I don't have
52:45 - to bring over I just want to grab one
52:52 - more pull request and that's the last
52:57 - one that we currently have open which it
52:59 - feels really good to get all these pull
53:00 - requests taken care of I've been so
53:02 - behind on getting things merged and
53:04 - really it was it was this request that
53:07 - we just sorted out now that was making
53:09 - me fall behind the most I just kept
53:14 - trying to troubleshoot and didn't
53:16 - realize until we're there today that it
53:17 - was most likely a database thing okay so
53:23 - let's grab this poor request 47 and this
53:29 - is where har should implemented the
53:30 - masonry layout if you're not familiar
53:32 - with that it with what that is hopefully
53:34 - you'll see an example in just a minute
53:36 - so let's do a git fetch origin pool 47
53:44 - since it's pool requests 47 Ted and then
53:48 - we'll call this H masonry all right
53:53 - you don't have to name it H masonry you
53:56 - can name it whatever you want but I kind
53:59 - of like to put the first letter of the
54:02 - name of the person who's doing the pool
54:04 - request and then it just helps me keep
54:06 - straight who who did what and it helps
54:09 - me to be able to remember and give
54:11 - credit to the
54:12 - a person for doing this pool request so
54:15 - now let's check out let's do a get check
54:17 - out that new branch that we just created
54:19 - masonry and now whoops I keep forgetting
54:25 - I have the have a sent another screen
54:29 - recognized for your component oops I got
54:31 - to do a yarn it's a good idea to just
54:38 - run yarn all the time when you're
54:40 - pulling that down because if you don't
54:41 - need it it won't hurt anything but if
54:44 - you do need it it'll prevent you from
54:46 - maybe trying to troubleshoot something
54:49 - that you really shouldn't have to worry
54:52 - about because it should have been all
54:54 - taken care of
54:55 - oops let's try to restart before we do
55:08 - anything else
55:23 - okay great this is another thing that I
55:26 - found just from experience when you
55:29 - update when you switch to a new branch
55:31 - and you run yarn sometimes it's a good
55:34 - idea just to restart your server I know
55:37 - I've been very frustrated for a minute
55:39 - when things don't work and then luckily
55:42 - just a restart has been able to fix
55:45 - everything so try to do those two things
55:47 - run yarn or run NPM install and then
55:49 - restart the server before you try to
55:51 - troubleshoot anything it could save you
55:53 - a lot of time I know I've wasted a lot
55:55 - of time when I've forgotten to do that
55:58 - okay so anyway here's what we're talking
56:01 - about with masonry layout check that out
56:04 - that's just that looks cool write that
56:09 - all the cards just kind of flow so we
56:13 - had we talked about CSS grid so maybe it
56:16 - would be a good idea to explain the
56:17 - differences between what's going on here
56:19 - and CSS grid because certainly CSS grid
56:23 - is much more simple to to implement but
56:30 - what we had when we had the the grid was
56:35 - first initially when we implemented the
56:38 - grid we had these big gaps so we would
56:41 - have you know one two three and then our
56:43 - second row of three wouldn't start till
56:45 - here so it looked okay for these cards
56:48 - but then for this card there is this big
56:50 - white space then Harshit was able to set
56:53 - a uniform height for these and that got
56:58 - rid of our gaps but then on cards like
57:01 - this we would have a huge white space
57:03 - within the card so what what masonry
57:13 - does and behind the scenes what's going
57:16 - on here is using some JavaScript to
57:19 - position these so this is not CSS
57:22 - positioning each one of these actually
57:24 - has a position I mean I can you can
57:27 - actually see it happening in the console
57:31 - let's see
57:34 - maybe try to get to the right spot here
57:38 - and okay I guess the the first card is
57:48 - not really that useful to look at
57:50 - because all right so let me let me make
57:54 - this a bit bigger see all can can see it
57:56 - and then it'll be it'll be really
57:59 - obvious what's going on behind the
58:00 - scenes in just a second so let's bring
58:04 - this over I'm looking right here at this
58:08 - this positioning so it's absolute
58:10 - position right now it's left four
58:13 - hundred and some four and twenty six
58:14 - pixels top zero so as we move you can
58:21 - see the pixels changing so that's three
58:26 - eighteen three fifty so and now we have
58:30 - our top change so the absolute
58:34 - positioning is constantly changing based
58:37 - on the screen the screen size so that's
58:42 - that's the difference there is the CSS
58:46 - grid of course is CSS based positioning
58:48 - and this is certainly it uses CSS right
58:52 - which we're saying position:absolute
58:53 - left top those are CSS attributes but
58:59 - javascript is directly controlling those
59:01 - so anyway that's how you deal with
59:06 - masonry masonry can be a pain at times I
59:09 - know in previous projects we had
59:14 - implemented this with react before and
59:19 - it took a while to get that that was
59:20 - with project one it took it took a
59:22 - little while to get it working and I've
59:25 - tried to implement this with with some
59:27 - jQuery stuff before it's definitely it
59:30 - can be a pain at times especially if you
59:31 - have images to get the positioning
59:34 - correct you you need to be able to have
59:38 - everything get repositioned whenever the
59:40 - image is actually load there's a helper
59:42 - library for that as well but there's a
59:44 - lot of different things that could go
59:48 - when you're using this but I think the
59:49 - end result is is worth it and there's
59:54 - cool things you could do with this like
59:56 - like filtering to you know have things
60:00 - just switch around you know on the fly
60:04 - it looks nice there's different types of
60:08 - transitions that you could use so this
60:11 - there's different options so anyway
60:14 - really nice great work on that hard
60:17 - I really like that
60:19 - and you can see you know our ListView is
60:21 - still just regular ListView but when we
60:25 - go back to grid view much nicer so great
60:30 - that's great job and we should have the
60:32 - same thing here when we go to our
60:34 - categories as well right now we don't
60:38 - really have enough posts to be able to
60:39 - see you know the full grid in action
60:41 - here but very nice okay
60:46 - let me check my time all right so this
60:48 - I'm almost done with this 25 minutes so
60:50 - I'm just going to go into the live chat
60:52 - now and answer some of your questions so
60:54 - basically we've achieved what we met
60:56 - what we wanted to achieve we've
60:59 - successfully troubleshooted what was
61:01 - wrong with our auth and with our log in
61:05 - system and the problem ended up being
61:07 - just for some reason I can't connect to
61:10 - a remote database so we had to run it
61:13 - locally so everything seems to be
61:16 - working with that we're able to get this
61:19 - grid layout in and I guess we could
61:22 - merge that in right now as well since I
61:24 - have a minute left it'll only take a
61:26 - minute to merge so let's go ahead and
61:29 - and merge that while we're here so first
61:32 - let's do a git merge master all right we
61:39 - have a conflict all right this is cool
61:40 - I'm really glad we had a conflict ok
61:44 - hard saying to try the logout ok cool
61:47 - off shar the logout let me finish this
61:49 - merge and then we'll try that ok
61:55 - Harshit also wants to make sure that
61:57 - that it is known that
61:59 - to use materialized for masonry yeah I
62:01 - did see that that comment in your pool
62:04 - request so how should saying is a real
62:07 - pain yeah I do I appreciate all the work
62:10 - I mean I I know I've I've had a lot of
62:15 - pain in dealing with this as well both
62:17 - with react and with without react with
62:21 - with some javis a query based single
62:25 - page apps that I made before before I
62:28 - started streaming so I definitely
62:31 - appreciate all the work that went into
62:34 - that
62:35 - so let's um let's see oops
62:44 - trying to find oh here we go alright
62:47 - where's their merge conflict that it was
62:48 - in that CSS file was it not okay alright
62:53 - cool so here if you've never seen a
62:56 - conflict emerge conflict it can look
63:01 - different depending on what editor
63:03 - you're using but basically you're gonna
63:06 - have sections from each and then you're
63:10 - gonna have a section where it gets kind
63:12 - of telling you here's what we think it
63:14 - should look like and so you get to
63:17 - choose what you want so let's check out
63:19 - what's going on here so our head is
63:24 - going to be our current branch so our
63:26 - current branch is that masonry branch
63:31 - so whatever branch your own is the head
63:32 - and then our other branches our master
63:36 - branch so that's what we have currently
63:38 - on a master branch so probably what we
63:41 - want to do is keep whatever's in the
63:46 - master branch so yeah we don't want all
63:54 - this stuff so what we're gonna do then
63:55 - is use master ok so you won't always
64:03 - have that option it does depend on what
64:05 - you're doing with your or what kind of
64:07 - editor you're using my packages that you
64:09 - have so you may have to manually
64:12 - get rid of manually delete that but in
64:14 - this case we can just click use me and
64:16 - it handles it for us which is nice so
64:18 - now we have this padding right important
64:21 - I do believe we want to keep that but
64:24 - let's see oh no we do we need that we
64:33 - have it on body let me double check so
64:36 - let's double check in I guess I can just
64:40 - run this on the on my other screen let
64:47 - me double check quickly what we have
64:49 - here yes
64:54 - oops I need index that's CSS okay we are
65:03 - gonna keep that we are gonna keep this
65:11 - right let me check the live chat quickly
65:13 - Sebastian will know more than anyone
65:15 - whether or not we need to keep this so
65:17 - Sebastian if you're still with us in the
65:20 - live chat let me know I mean this is not
65:24 - really a big deal this is not hard to go
65:27 - back in and change this let's see we'll
65:35 - just we'll keep this in for now if we
65:37 - notice that something weird is happening
65:38 - with it we can always take it out but
65:40 - anyway now I've saved that and we can
65:46 - see if we go back in here we're gonna
65:54 - commit so let me double check and make
65:57 - sure ok was just with index it'll tell
66:00 - you what files have have conflicts so
66:02 - since it was just indexed on CSS we fix
66:05 - those conflicts let's go in here and get
66:09 - commit I'm gonna do a git commit I'm
66:12 - gonna put the commit message right in
66:15 - line here and say
66:37 - okay it's running our tests great okay
66:42 - awesome so the merge has worked
66:44 - now let's well let's quickly just double
66:48 - check and make sure everything's working
66:49 - I don't really have any reason to think
66:53 - that it wouldn't work but worth a shot
66:58 - and then we can also test out our logout
67:01 - as well all right looks good looks good
67:12 - great what else did we have this bad all
67:18 - right wonderful
67:20 - all right let's test our logout okay
67:24 - great we're able to log out and we'll
67:28 - just test a login great that was nice
67:30 - and quick we have our our token here and
67:40 - awesome loves us right back in wonderful
67:45 - okay now let's do get checkout master
67:49 - and we'll do a git merge H mace H
67:57 - masonry awesome now we have the masonry
68:03 - branch here and we can do a git master
68:11 - awesome so now everything should be
68:14 - up-to-date we'll have all our pull
68:16 - requests merge for the bulletins react
68:19 - wonderful okay we do still have we have
68:23 - one issue open and there's certainly
68:26 - more that needs to be done so maybe I'll
68:28 - try to add some more issues in here so
68:32 - if anybody would like to work on them
68:34 - you can work on them if anybody needs to
68:38 - get those last few pull requests in
68:40 - before for hack tober fast to get your
68:43 - t-shirt maybe I'll try to put in some
68:46 - some some of them are going to be more
68:48 - difficult some of the issues
68:49 - maybe you'll try to put in some easy
68:51 - ones if anybody's kind of new to coding
68:54 - but still wants to get the pull requests
68:57 - in also I still don't have all my pull
69:01 - requests in so if anybody has a project
69:03 - that you need some help with and would
69:05 - like me to open a pull request for your
69:07 - project let me know send me a link to
69:11 - your repository and let me know what
69:17 - need what you need work on so now that
69:20 - I've finished my class I may have a
69:23 - little extra time to work on stuff like
69:26 - that so I probably won't be able to like
69:30 - do anything really significant but you
69:35 - all helped me out so much it'd be cool
69:38 - if I could help you out with something
69:39 - as well all right so let me go through
69:45 - the live chat now and that'll be the
69:51 - last thing that we do let's see so if
70:00 - you have any questions please put them
70:03 - in the live chat now I'll do my best to
70:05 - answer all the questions if you don't
70:07 - have a question please consider sticking
70:09 - around and helping to answer some of the
70:10 - questions I'd love to have your
70:11 - expertise to help give the best answers
70:15 - we can to everybody that's that's asking
70:17 - questions but if you can't stick around
70:22 - you can always catch the Q&A session
70:26 - later in the recording and please join
70:29 - us again tomorrow should be around the
70:31 - same time today was a little later than
70:34 - normal but I like to stream around 2
70:36 - p.m. Eastern Time we may will probably
70:42 - end up working on some UI stuff tomorrow
70:43 - I haven't decided for sure but maybe
70:49 - we'll work on some of that we've had
70:51 - some heavy back-end stuff lately so it
70:54 - might be nice to switch it up do some
70:57 - some front end you know CSS work so but
71:02 - let me know if anybody
71:03 - as anything specifically they'd really
71:05 - like me to go over tomorrow let me know
71:07 - in the live chat right now or send me a
71:09 - message on Twitter and if if it's doable
71:12 - within the scope of the project I'd be
71:14 - more than happy to to steer the stream
71:17 - in that direction okay let me find where
71:21 - I left off
71:22 - there we are
71:25 - oh you know before I forget yesterday I
71:33 - had I think it was harsh it asked about
71:37 - freelancing and then I had someone on
71:38 - Twitter as well asked about freelancing
71:40 - so we'll see how much time the
71:43 - question/answer takes maybe I'll talk
71:45 - about it now but I've been thinking
71:46 - maybe I should do a video a short video
71:49 - and put it on my own YouTube channel
71:51 - about my experience as a freelancer and
71:53 - my advice to anybody that wants to be a
71:56 - freelance web developer so if you think
71:59 - you might be interested in that let me
72:01 - know if nobody's really interested maybe
72:03 - I won't take the time to do it but
72:05 - otherwise if you think it might be
72:07 - helpful for you I did freelance I was a
72:10 - freelance web developer for three years
72:12 - so and I still do freelancing on the
72:15 - side so I'm certainly not the best there
72:19 - is but I have a lot of you know
72:22 - experience about five years of
72:24 - experience so that at least I could give
72:28 - you some advice over the areas where I
72:30 - made mistakes in some of the areas where
72:32 - I was successful
72:58 - all right still I'm scrolling down
73:00 - looking for questions a lot of this
73:02 - section of live chat I was interacting a
73:05 - lot during the the coding so things that
73:09 - we've already talked about I'm just kind
73:11 - of skipping it over okay actually Rohan
73:19 - has a good comment here so previously we
73:23 - were talking about homebrew and I was
73:28 - trying to explain a little bit about
73:29 - what it does but I like what Rohan says
73:32 - here he says homebrew is a package
73:34 - manager for apps for mac just like NPM
73:39 - is for node packages so on Linux you
73:43 - would have apps and YUM so if you think
73:50 - of it like that I think that's
73:51 - definitely on the right track that'll
73:53 - make it easier if you've never done
73:55 - anything with homebrew basically the
73:58 - same thing does a very similar thing and
74:01 - then what is
74:02 - I forget the one that's for PHP but PHP
74:04 - has something similar
74:22 - okay rook asks if there's a Windows
74:25 - counterpart for homebrew Rowan says it's
74:29 - chocolaty okay that's awesome
74:31 - I've actually didn't know that I haven't
74:33 - really done anything on Windows for a
74:35 - few years now but when I did a lot of
74:39 - development on Windows I had no idea so
74:41 - that's that's awesome so for everyone on
74:44 - a Mac check out homebrew for as a
74:46 - package manager but if you're on a
74:47 - Windows machine check out chocolaty hug
74:54 - harsh it reminded me that my timer was
74:57 - not visible so sorry about that
74:59 - I always forget I just I gotta get used
75:02 - to putting it somewhere else I'm seeing
75:10 - all the horseshit trying to get my
75:13 - attention typing in in all caps so sorry
75:16 - for all the stress that my inattention
75:20 - cost you there I appreciate you being
75:22 - persistent in trying to get my attention
75:24 - though
76:07 - okay earlier I was checking I think I
76:11 - was checking on a different screen but I
76:13 - was mentioning local storage and cookies
76:17 - so I wanted to know where the where the
76:21 - login information was being stored so if
76:23 - you didn't if you didn't catch that I
76:26 - was able to log in on this tab and then
76:31 - this tab was still on the login screen
76:33 - and I just refreshed I was automatically
76:35 - logged in basically there's a cookie
76:41 - stored now currently the the live
76:44 - version of this that's a non react very
76:47 - uses local storage to accomplish the
76:50 - same thing basically to store user data
76:52 - so that the login session can persist so
76:58 - as long as you don't log out or clear
77:00 - your cookies then it should persist so
77:03 - actually not sure is if anyone has any
77:06 - opinion on which is better to use
77:07 - cookies or to use local storage let me
77:10 - know I'd be interested to see if there's
77:14 - if there's some good reason to use one
77:16 - or the other I know I believe cookies
77:21 - that have to be smaller so you have the
77:23 - opportunity to store more in local
77:25 - storage in this case we're not really
77:27 - storing that much so it shouldn't be an
77:29 - issue but if anyone's work with that or
77:32 - has any opinion on that please let me
77:35 - know
77:58 - okay Harshit earlier i was talking about
78:02 - how there might be an issue for for
78:05 - someone else to log in and Harshit said
78:07 - i i was setting up said you said that
78:11 - you need the franciscan needy you
78:13 - off-guard i simply implemented it yeah
78:18 - yeah don't worry i'm not upset that you
78:20 - implemented it i'm actually really glad
78:22 - that you did that because that's exactly
78:25 - what we need for when this goes live I
78:28 - was just trying to think of an easy way
78:30 - for other people to be able to
78:32 - contribute to the project maybe without
78:35 - having to set up a database and
78:37 - everything because I still want this to
78:39 - be as beginner-friendly as possible you
78:42 - know there's some there's some little
78:44 - things that people who are new could
78:45 - could contribute to the project but they
78:49 - may not be able to figure out I mean I
78:51 - did a whole database thing I needed your
78:54 - help to figure that out as well so I
78:56 - just wanted to try to think of some way
78:58 - to make it a bit easier so I'm thinking
79:00 - maybe maybe I could put something into
79:04 - where it checks whether it's in
79:05 - development mode or production and if
79:07 - it's in dev mode we just disabled the
79:09 - log in and then if it's in production
79:12 - then then it is enabled and then that
79:18 - might be the better way so we'll
79:20 - definitely still want to enable it and
79:22 - test it before we go live with it but
79:25 - when we're doing like UI work and things
79:28 - maybe we can just just disable that I
79:33 - know it's a tional II it's a pain like
79:36 - on the live version if I want to use I
79:40 - have authentication enabled all the time
79:43 - even if I'm running it locally and it's
79:46 - tough if I use like browser stack to
79:49 - test the browsers and browsers that
79:51 - don't have my local storage data so I
79:56 - have to log in I have another email sent
79:59 - and log in again on every different
80:01 - machine I want to be on if I want to
80:03 - test it on a phone or something like
80:05 - that so I end up having to log in quite
80:08 - a bit so it
80:12 - be cool if we came up with a simple way
80:14 - to disable the login for testing
80:17 - purposes so anyway I just don't want you
80:21 - to think that that was wrong to
80:24 - implement that that was perfect that was
80:25 - exactly what I wanted
80:38 - okay rooks asking what all those
80:40 - warnings actually mean the incorrect
80:42 - peer dependency yeah let's check that
80:44 - out but look at all these things all
80:49 - right let me read down and see if
80:50 - anybody else said anything
80:59 - and see
81:04 - okay I don't it looks like dragon hunter
81:07 - said I can RM RF node modules and then
81:10 - run yarn so would that get rid of this
81:14 - I'll try that out okay so actually this
81:19 - would be cool to run so if you end up
81:20 - having weird problems with your node
81:22 - modules I have done this in the past and
81:25 - it has fixed some of my problems
81:26 - it doesn't always but occasionally
81:28 - basically this is like completely wiping
81:31 - out all your node modules and
81:32 - reinstalling everything and starting
81:34 - from scratch let's do it it's not gonna
81:36 - hurt the project it's just going to take
81:38 - a couple minutes to get everything back
81:39 - but what you're using so we're going to
81:43 - use this RM RF oops RF do not use this
81:48 - unless you're really sure because what
81:50 - this is going to do RM is just remove
81:53 - right but this is gonna remove
81:55 - everything in a folder so all subfolders
81:59 - all files everything so only use this if
82:04 - you're really sure that you want
82:06 - everything to be gone alright this stuff
82:08 - does not go in the recycle bin this is
82:10 - gone like forever gone so having said
82:15 - that I know that I'm okay with my node
82:19 - modules being gone I've done this you
82:21 - know plenty of times so our node modules
82:25 - and when we when I run this everything's
82:28 - going to be gone and our node modules
82:29 - folder is gonna be gone so let's go CD
82:41 - right I can't I can't even get to that
82:44 - that that doesn't exist okay our node
82:46 - module so now we're gonna run yarn and
82:50 - know we're still getting the same errors
82:52 - okay so I guess I didn't fix it it's in
82:56 - Korea dependency hmm I don't really know
83:00 - what the issue is maybe if I updated all
83:03 - of our packages it might work I'm a
83:05 - hesitant to do that right now because
83:08 - but sometimes when you upgrade packages
83:11 - they break something if they're breaking
83:12 - changes within the packages so I'd
83:16 - rather not do that
83:18 - at the end of the day the end of a
83:19 - workday hum but let's just double-check
83:25 - everything still works it should work so
83:28 - let's refresh alright great still works
83:33 - see all right let's go back to the live
83:38 - chat
83:39 - oh cool dragon hunter says actually that
83:46 - grid is neat so a good job yeah
83:47 - definitely good job harsh it really like
83:50 - that
83:58 - okay rook said I just got an email from
84:00 - Codecademy that they teach grid now on
84:03 - their CSS court course doing that later
84:06 - get course first awesome yeah that
84:09 - that's the CSS grid is really good for a
84:14 - lot of things this is probably one of
84:15 - the very few use cases that I would want
84:18 - to go with something else just for this
84:19 - in particular CSS is it's good it's
84:25 - great it's always getting better but
84:27 - there's still no easy way to do
84:30 - something like this with CSS and be able
84:35 - to have as much control over layout as
84:38 - you could you know we're doing this with
84:41 - JavaScript
84:53 - okay John Hanson says grid so CSS grid
84:57 - has grid Auto flow row column row dense
85:02 - column dense which gives very tight fit
85:04 - and you can set min max on the rows and
85:06 - columns cool actually I would love to
85:10 - see an example of some something like
85:13 - this done with CSS grid if it's possible
85:17 - to do something that that truly looks
85:19 - like this if there's a pure CSS way to
85:23 - do it I'm I'm definitely open to it
85:35 - so I'm not aware at least the last time
85:38 - I tried to implement something like this
85:40 - which is normal CSS as far as I could
85:44 - tell with with researching it there was
85:46 - not a way to get this exact layout but
85:52 - maybe maybe something's happened since
85:53 - then with with CSS grid that allows it
86:16 - Blake says my droid is isn't displaying
86:19 - all my categories actually if you like
86:24 - if you're having trouble with with some
86:27 - of your files send me send me a link to
86:30 - your repo let me know what's going on I
86:33 - can take a look at it if you want me to
86:39 - harsh it says so so you now like
86:42 - password this NPM module I I don't have
86:47 - an opinion about it yet because I've
86:50 - only worked with it in terms of just
86:52 - reading the documentation to be able to
86:54 - understand what you did and try to
86:57 - troubleshoot so I don't know that I've
86:59 - used it enough to reasonably have an
87:02 - opinion about it but it's definitely
87:04 - working to do what we wanted to do in
87:08 - terms of the password let's login so I
87:09 - do like the results
87:19 - Harshit says will I get a t-shirt this
87:23 - as I have 20 PRS yeah I'm for sure you
87:26 - have you have enough full requests just
87:28 - on this project alone I mean I'm
87:31 - assuming you did sign up for hack tober
87:33 - fest so assuming you signed up you'll
87:36 - definitely get to keep this shirt
88:01 - okay so on Hanson saying so in react to
88:05 - change state on an imported component on
88:08 - click go up the Dom to retrieve a key
88:11 - value then uses that key to array dot
88:16 - fine using the key to locate it and pull
88:20 - in the data I'm not sure I'm not really
88:29 - sure how that works behind the scenes so
88:31 - I'm not I don't know that I could
88:34 - comment enough on the mechanics of what
88:37 - is happening behind the scenes within
88:38 - react okay cool it looks like a few of
88:43 - you are interested in freelancing advice
89:08 - oh cool thanks Harsha I mentioned
89:11 - there's a package manager for PHP but I
89:13 - couldn't remember it was its composer
89:15 - all right that makes sense I am I was
89:18 - thinking it started with like a calm I
89:21 - was thinking compass but I knew it was
89:22 - and I was just thinking that because we
89:24 - used something called compass earlier at
89:28 - least we're going to use it so awesome
89:30 - it's called composer for PHP so for any
89:32 - p8 I know we have some PHP people that
89:34 - watch the stream so if you haven't
89:37 - already used a check out composer as a
89:39 - package manager for PHP oh cool and
89:43 - Zuber mentions that rails have gem so
89:47 - gems the package manager and for dotnet
89:49 - the package manager is nugget awesome
89:56 - thanks for that Zuber I don't know that
89:59 - I've seen you that much in the live chat
90:01 - commenting so I don't know if if you're
90:03 - new here to the chat are you just
90:06 - usually not able to comment in the live
90:09 - chat that frequently but anyway welcome
90:11 - and thanks for contributing okay in ass
90:21 - where do you find customers for
90:23 - freelance projects okay cool I'll answer
90:27 - like I said I think I'm going to do a
90:28 - video and in going more depth into this
90:31 - but I'll definitely answer this about
90:33 - freelancing right now so the questions
90:37 - where do you find customers for
90:40 - freelance projects so I'm just going to
90:43 - speak from my experience and and maybe
90:45 - try to give some advice some more
90:47 - general advice but for me I'll tell you
90:52 - I'll tell you what didn't work so I got
90:56 - I think I got one customer through my
91:02 - website through the contact form on my
91:04 - website only one ever now I'm sure that
91:10 - my website helped because people could
91:13 - go there first and check me out or you
91:16 - know whatever it probably did help but
91:20 - the contact form on my
91:22 - it was not really that useful I did sign
91:27 - up for several different freelancing
91:31 - sites so I think I did just call it
91:35 - freelancer maybe it was called
91:37 - freelancer so I did that one I did she
91:41 - was the other one they still send me
91:43 - messages all the time no I can't
91:48 - remember what it was okay so I basically
91:50 - did one where they send you potential
91:54 - customers and you can bid on the project
91:57 - so basically you have to buy like tokens
91:59 - to be able to bid on it I only got one
92:02 - customer from that and it was a really
92:04 - small customer I don't think I made more
92:06 - than $100 off of working with that
92:09 - customer so that wasn't great the same
92:14 - thing with the freelance website I
92:16 - didn't really have a great experience it
92:19 - seems like you have to to get projects
92:22 - you just have to undercut everybody else
92:24 - in terms of price so low that it's it's
92:27 - basically like working for free it takes
92:30 - a lot of work to get enough reputation
92:32 - on those things
92:33 - so I don't personally recommend that
92:36 - unless you really have nowhere else to
92:37 - go and you just want to get some work
92:39 - for your portfolio then you know go
92:43 - ahead and go to those freelance websites
92:44 - what works for me the most was personal
92:51 - connections and I know when I heard this
92:56 - when I was starting out freelancing I
92:58 - always I didn't want to hear that right
93:00 - because I want to just be able to sit at
93:03 - my computer and code and get customers
93:05 - but that's not really how it how it
93:07 - works freelancing is about selling
93:10 - yourself just as much as it's about
93:11 - coding so you have to be willing to talk
93:18 - to people and let them know what you do
93:19 - and you know be able to show them some
93:23 - of your projects basically to talk about
93:25 - how great you are and how great work you
93:28 - have so if you're not comfortable with
93:30 - that I would rethink freelancing or at
93:32 - least think of a different
93:34 - so here's what I did starting out that
93:36 - really helped me I found someone who was
93:40 - willing to do the work to find customers
93:42 - and then they would give me the projects
93:47 - to work on but they needed a go-between
93:49 - between the customer and between me so I
93:51 - didn't have to handle contracts I didn't
93:54 - have to go to meetings with a customer
93:55 - I rarely had to speak on the phone with
93:58 - customers or email with them this person
94:01 - did all the work now the downside of
94:02 - that is that I made a lot less than I
94:05 - could have if I had done everything but
94:08 - it was nice because I got to focus all
94:10 - my energy on my time on just doing the
94:13 - work doing the coding so I was able to
94:15 - learn a lot more than I otherwise would
94:17 - have if I had to handle everything now
94:20 - through that I was able to build up my
94:22 - portfolio and focus on the coding and
94:26 - then I was able little by little to get
94:30 - some clients so at first maybe it was
94:32 - through family connections I just let my
94:35 - people in my family know you know aunts
94:37 - uncles cousins you know hey I'm working
94:39 - on this and then they would mention it
94:42 - to people that they knew so I got some
94:45 - work from that didn't make a ton of
94:47 - money off of it but I was still trying
94:49 - to build my portfolio I was able to
94:53 - through social media let people know
94:56 - what I was doing so I reached an even
94:59 - bigger audience of people that I still
95:01 - knew in real life and his friends with
95:03 - but then they could bring me connections
95:06 - so I had some of my best clients came
95:09 - from a connection of someone who was a
95:11 - former student of mine when I used to
95:13 - teach high school their boyfriend needed
95:16 - a website and then I did a website for
95:21 - their boyfriend their boyfriend's one of
95:23 - his best friends needed a website for
95:25 - their company saw what I did and then
95:28 - wanted me to work on their websites so I
95:30 - ended up getting into the New York City
95:32 - market through them even though I live
95:36 - far away from from New York City then
95:40 - through them the CEO of that company his
95:45 - his mom and
95:47 - dad runs several other companies in New
95:50 - York and I was able to do websites for
95:53 - them that ended up being one of my best
95:55 - clients I made the most money off of it
95:57 - was very very nice working relationship
96:02 - steady income the biggest client I ever
96:06 - had in terms of money I got because
96:11 - through social media
96:13 - someone who my wife went to college with
96:16 - worked for a company and her father was
96:19 - the CEO of the company found out through
96:23 - my wife that I did websites because she
96:27 - had just asked on social media hey does
96:29 - anybody know anything about websites my
96:31 - wife is able to say yeah got a client
96:33 - from that that was when I did that
96:35 - website and finally finished it and got
96:38 - paid that increased my income by 25%
96:44 - that year just from that one website so
96:47 - basically my point is my best clients
96:52 - came from personal connections sometimes
96:56 - I didn't actually know the people but
96:57 - people I knew knew those people so like
97:02 - I said maybe you might be comfortable
97:03 - this maybe you won't but what you really
97:05 - should be doing if you want to make
97:07 - freelancing work is talking about what
97:11 - you do to the people around you you
97:13 - don't have to be annoying about it you
97:15 - don't have to only talk about that but
97:16 - make sure that everybody on social media
97:19 - knows who you are and what you can do
97:21 - make sure that all your friends and
97:24 - family know what you can do and that's
97:28 - going to be your best clients if you
97:29 - want to advertise otherwise so I did
97:31 - paid ads on on Facebook on Twitter on
97:34 - LinkedIn Google Ads
97:37 - I did all those different ads I did not
97:42 - get customers from those ads was it was
97:46 - a good experience I learned how to use
97:49 - all this products and be able to advise
97:51 - clients on on how to use them search
97:54 - engine optimization it helped to get my
97:57 - website up to you know the
97:58 - first page of Google near the top for my
98:00 - local area but my best clients weren't
98:04 - from the local area anyway so that
98:06 - really wasn't it wasn't a big deal so
98:08 - all those things are good because
98:10 - clients will expect you to have them
98:12 - they'll expect you to have good SEO
98:13 - they'll expect you to have you know a
98:16 - good presence on social media and stuff
98:17 - and if you don't have that they might
98:19 - start to doubt well like does this
98:21 - person really know what they're doing
98:22 - they can't even manage their own website
98:24 - and brand so you have to do those things
98:27 - but don't expect that those things are
98:29 - going to bring you in a ton of clients
98:31 - maybe if you were well-known enough at
98:33 - some point it would help but at first
98:35 - personal connections are where it's at
98:37 - so I went on for a long time about that
98:40 - sorry but it's really important the
98:44 - other option that you have I mentioned I
98:46 - found someone who is willing to be the
98:48 - go-between between the clients and I
98:51 - there are services that do that as well
98:54 - if you can't find a personal connection
98:56 - that would want to do that for you so
98:59 - top towel is an organization that you
99:02 - you take a series of tests so that they
99:05 - know that you're a good developer and
99:06 - then they set you up with clients they
99:09 - handle all the contracts with clients
99:11 - they're the ones that pay you directly
99:13 - the clients don't pay you directly so it
99:17 - cuts down on a lot of that stuff that is
99:20 - not always easy to deal with right if
99:23 - you I've had situations where clients
99:25 - didn't pay me when they were supposed to
99:26 - pay me and it can be a mess and it
99:28 - really is stressful when you're counting
99:30 - on income for your family and you know a
99:34 - company is not paying you so that's a
99:37 - tough situation that's another thing I
99:39 - do recommend always always have a
99:41 - contract I I worked without contracts
99:44 - for a long time and I never had problems
99:45 - and I thought it was fine until somebody
99:48 - decided not to pay me and after that I
99:51 - never did work without a contract so you
99:55 - might be able to get lucky for a while I
99:57 - got lucky with it for like two years but
100:02 - then I had a client not pay me and it
100:04 - just it took forever to get paid luckily
100:06 - I did finally get paid but
100:08 - months after I was supposed to receive a
100:11 - payment so anyway I know I just threw a
100:15 - lot at you hopefully I'll have some time
100:18 - to put that in a more organized format
100:20 - in a video at some point but let me know
100:24 - if you have any other questions let me
100:27 - know maybe it'll be good I can write all
100:29 - the questions down and then try to make
100:31 - sure I answer them in my video
100:48 - Blake asks what should I use for
100:49 - wireframing on Windows for free um hmm
100:56 - I'm not sure of Windows what does the
101:02 - thing Adobe came out is it called Adobe
101:08 - XD it was something like that but I
101:12 - don't know if it was free it might have
101:14 - just been free when you they were
101:15 - testing it so I'm not sure I don't have
101:22 - anything that I use for Windows so I
101:24 - don't know of anything but if anyone
101:28 - else knows of anything good and free to
101:31 - do wireframes on Windows please put that
101:34 - in the lab chat now
101:46 - okay John Hanson says I think the big
101:49 - guys like Google are pushing for
101:50 - developers to use local storage dragon
101:53 - on it says go for local storage or local
101:56 - forage module okay cool yeah maybe we'll
102:07 - maybe we'll check into that it's
102:09 - switching it over to local storage
102:13 - Harshit says it would definitely be
102:14 - harder to set that up so we'll check it
102:17 - out
102:21 - maybe we'll see how difficult it will be
102:23 - if it'll be worth it to set it up I'm
102:25 - for this project I'm not worried one way
102:28 - or the other if we're gonna switch it
102:31 - over I would want to do it because if
102:33 - that's the the best practice to do then
102:36 - I think it would be cool to do that on
102:38 - the stream just to show this is how we
102:42 - should do things but otherwise I think
102:44 - cookies will be more than adequate for
102:47 - this use case rohan says the it's quite
102:54 - the irony because most of google
102:56 - services rely heavily on cookies most
102:58 - don't even touch local stores yeah
103:00 - you're right actually
103:02 - that's definitely true
103:22 - rook says Google is weird like that they
103:24 - don't even use angular from what I've
103:26 - heard oh yeah I don't I don't know I
103:29 - usually check with which sites are made
103:32 - out of I haven't done that for a while
103:33 - with Google Sites
103:46 - everyone says using Google API is it's
103:48 - quite common that you can see them say
103:50 - to do the opposite of what they usually
103:52 - say you would usually do really
103:55 - frustrating but that's Google they use
103:57 - angular across many things now
104:06 - okay so dragon hunter says HTTP only
104:09 - cookies are not vulnerable to XSS
104:12 - attacks cross-site scripting attacks but
104:15 - to CSRF attacks so the session could be
104:18 - hijacked okay actually to be honest with
104:22 - you for this project the data is not
104:26 - really sensitive most of the data that
104:29 - ends up in the bulletin is also publicly
104:31 - available through other channels so I'm
104:33 - not that worried about it to be honest
104:35 - with you I never thought that this
104:37 - bulletin should have to be password
104:39 - protected that was a decision made
104:40 - higher up and I fought against it but I
104:43 - lost so I'm not super worried about the
104:49 - security in terms of if somebody really
104:52 - wants to find out you know the what's
104:54 - going on in the bulletin like they're
104:57 - gonna know the dates of when you can go
104:59 - get training on PowerPoint and they're
105:02 - gonna they're going to know what open
105:04 - positions that we have at the University
105:06 - which you can already find out on the
105:07 - main website they're gonna see the
105:10 - chapel's schedule for when they're there
105:12 - are mass times which you can already see
105:13 - on the main web site so there are very
105:15 - few things it I would argue there's
105:18 - pretty much nothing that should that
105:21 - couldn't be public knowledge but anyway
105:25 - I was told that an easy password
105:27 - protected so that's what I'm going to do
105:28 - and I'm gonna provide a reasonable level
105:30 - of security but I'm not going to kind of
105:34 - over engineer this so that we're
105:35 - protected from all everything that could
105:38 - possibly happen if at some point we end
105:40 - up working with more sensitive data then
105:43 - definitely yes I think we should be as
105:45 - safe as we can but I think it
105:48 - potentially could be a waste of a waste
105:52 - of our time to really try to you know
105:55 - make this solid and you know airtight
105:57 - and no one can get in
106:10 - Harshit says I remember some guy named a
106:12 - folder it's the the little Tod icon and
106:16 - and he did RM RF tilde and his whole
106:20 - date it was wiped yeah yeah that you
106:23 - could literally wipe out everything on
106:25 - your hard drive with RM RF so like don't
106:28 - use it unless you for sure know what's
106:31 - going on dragon under says to choose
106:38 - between CSRF and XSS definitely take
106:43 - measures about XSS and forget about CSRF
106:47 - soar local storage all the way
106:56 - okay rook says I heard some guys on the
106:59 - syntax podcast talking about how scary
107:01 - our MRF is they suggest using something
107:06 - called trash it's on brew okay cool
107:08 - oh maybe I'll look into that right now I
107:13 - I rarely use RM RF when I do use it
107:16 - obviously like I I'm very careful about
107:18 - it but if I find myself having to use it
107:21 - more often might not be a bad idea to
107:23 - switch to something a little safer
107:40 - dragon hunter says is there a yarn lock
107:44 - like npm yeah yes there is a yarn lock
107:50 - file and then in a new version of NPM
107:52 - there's the equivalent file ok harsh
107:59 - it's saying basically since I'm using
108:01 - react 16 many packages are not updated
108:04 - that so that's that's probably why I'm
108:06 - getting the warnings okay dragon owner
108:17 - says our MRF node modules works with NPM
108:19 - it seems to not with yarn yeah I mean I
108:22 - guess if you really wanted to get rid of
108:23 - it you should get rid of your yarn lock
108:25 - file too so you could R get rid all the
108:28 - node modules and your yarn lock and then
108:31 - you could reinstall the from that way if
108:34 - you really wanted it to be totally clean
108:36 - slate all Roland says you could also use
108:44 - the force flag to force reinstall of all
108:47 - node packages all right good to know
108:50 - thanks your honor
109:34 - okay I think I think John Hanson is is
109:37 - explaining more is his question earlier
109:39 - about react like moving up to get I
109:44 - don't remember exactly what it was but
109:46 - he's saying vanilla Jas allows easily
109:50 - moving up and down the Dom to create
109:52 - comparison statement is true Falls to
109:54 - render an object I'm not sure if it's
109:56 - smart to do the same in react okay I'm
109:59 - not sure I might need to see a use case
110:01 - to give a decent answer to that so
110:05 - anyway so John if you if you have a use
110:10 - case then maybe I could I could give an
110:12 - opinion on that
110:28 - okay world's us how much would you
110:30 - charge or get for an average project
110:33 - okay I'm going to be I'm going to be
110:34 - completely honest here about what I
110:39 - charge and what I get so I'm not going
110:41 - to name names of clients and they may
110:43 - not want people to know what they what I
110:45 - get paid but I'll try to be vague about
110:47 - that but I'll tell you so when I started
110:49 - out five years ago I started out working
110:54 - getting work from someone else for $10
110:57 - an hour so which is a little bit crazy
111:02 - right I had two kids at the time and
111:07 - I've didn't pay $10 an hour or working
111:10 - less than full time doing this web work
111:14 - but the deal was basically the guy he
111:19 - knew me personally but he had no proof
111:22 - of my skills he just knew that back in
111:25 - high school I was smart and I was into
111:29 - technology stuff and he knew he could
111:31 - trust me so started me out and would say
111:35 - like hey I'll pay you $10 an hour but
111:39 - what I'll do is you know if you have a
111:41 - project that I need you to work on and
111:43 - you don't know how to do it I'll say you
111:45 - know take two hours I'll pay you for two
111:47 - hours to learn it and then do it right
111:49 - so I was able to learn a lot so I
111:52 - considered it like an internship only a
111:55 - paid internship which it really was kind
111:59 - of like that I learned a lot now what a
112:01 - you did say as well is that every slide
112:04 - on three months or something I'd be up
112:06 - for a race so I ended up making more
112:10 - than that quickly now along the way I
112:17 - moved up certainly whenever I got my own
112:19 - clients I would charge more I got to the
112:23 - point where one of my last projects that
112:26 - I worked on I ended up I did a react
112:30 - site that pooled data in from the
112:32 - WordPress API very similar to what we
112:36 - did on
112:38 - one of that we worked on it was actually
112:43 - it was almost identical in terms of the
112:46 - structure of the project as project one
112:50 - which was the catechetical Institute
112:51 - website and this project I did and I
112:54 - believe I made eleven thousand seven
113:04 - hundred dollars something like that
113:07 - somewhere around so like around twelve
113:10 - hundred dollars or twelve thousand
113:12 - dollars for that website so there was a
113:16 - whole range of stepping up what I would
113:20 - charge people and then it did sometimes
113:23 - depend on who I was doing the work for a
113:27 - nonprofit occasionally I would do work
113:31 - for free for a non-profit if I really
113:33 - wanted to Baal volunteer or I would at
113:36 - least I would give a discount sometimes
113:39 - if you know someone that was family or
113:42 - friend wanted something give him a
113:43 - discount but in general when you're
113:47 - freelancing it's always best to charge
113:50 - more than you think it's really worth
113:54 - because you have to consider more than
113:57 - just the project at hand because there's
113:59 - going to be over it so there's going to
114:01 - be meetings with the client phone calls
114:03 - you know Skype you know video
114:05 - conferencing there's going to be work on
114:08 - you getting a contract made and
114:11 - discussing that getting that sign you're
114:14 - gonna have to spend time sending bills
114:17 - making sure your client actually sends
114:19 - the bills so reminding them about that
114:23 - potentially even having disputes over
114:26 - billing there's going to be all this
114:29 - extra stuff then you have to worry about
114:30 - doing your taxes there's all this other
114:34 - stuff that's involved that you need to
114:37 - account for in the price so you're
114:40 - always going to end up charging more as
114:42 - a freelancer then you'd be willing to
114:43 - accept as a salary if you are on
114:46 - somebody's payroll and then don't forget
114:48 - about insurance as well health insurance
114:52 - you know sometimes your employer would
114:55 - cover that but now you are your own
114:56 - employer so always factoring more at
114:59 - this point in my with my work I would
115:04 - probably depends on the project
115:07 - potentially if it was some project I was
115:09 - really passionate about maybe I would I
115:13 - would do it for less but I wouldn't even
115:14 - consider doing work for anyone right now
115:16 - for less than $100 an hour
115:18 - if I was going hourly if we're talking a
115:21 - flat rate I mean I don't know that it
115:26 - would be worth my time to work on
115:28 - anything for less than like $5,000 I
115:32 - just wouldn't want to I just wouldn't
115:35 - want to deal with the whole process of
115:36 - building trust with a client and
115:38 - contracts and billing and all that in
115:40 - taxes unless I was making a decent chunk
115:43 - of money like I said it depends on the
115:47 - project if something I really wanted to
115:48 - work on then I would probably be willing
115:50 - to do less if something happened and I
115:54 - really needed money I'd probably be
115:55 - willing to do less but that's where I'm
115:57 - at right now I have income coming in
116:00 - that I'm able to pay my bills so I'm in
116:02 - a different position if I was at a point
116:05 - where I really needed to build up my
116:06 - portfolio I'd probably be willing to
116:08 - work for Less also it depends on where
116:11 - you're at if I lived in San Francisco I
116:13 - would I would never work for that little
116:17 - I would work one even more money because
116:19 - the cost of living is so much more I
116:21 - happen to live in the part of the United
116:23 - States where the cost of living is
116:24 - pretty low the area I live is
116:27 - economically depressed so I can I can
116:32 - charge less people in big cities would
116:35 - obviously want to charge more and then
116:36 - depending on what country you're from I
116:38 - it depends I don't know what you know
116:41 - the economies could be entirely
116:42 - different so anyway I could you know
116:47 - keep that in mind especially if your
116:49 - area like my area is economically
116:52 - depressed try to build up your client
116:54 - base outside that area for me I ended up
116:57 - building a client base in New York City
117:00 - I actually also had a client that she
117:04 - was based in Hawaii
117:06 - but she traveled quite a bit so I don't
117:09 - know how often she actually lived in
117:11 - Hawaii but those clients ended up being
117:14 - the most profitable because they for
117:18 - their market my prices seem like really
117:20 - good prayer for them for me I'd make
117:24 - from them more than anybody else was
117:26 - willing to pay in my local area so it
117:29 - was a great deal for both of us
117:30 - you know they were getting a better deal
117:32 - than they could get in their area and so
117:34 - was I so those kind of seek out those
117:38 - kind of deals and then you know you and
117:41 - the client can both be really happy
117:43 - about about what you're making hopefully
117:49 - that helped the original question was
117:50 - how much you charge or get for an
117:52 - average product project so that was
117:54 - probably way more than you wanted from
117:57 - that question but I hope it it helped
118:00 - you out at least some Blake as our vem
118:11 - and Emax considered code editors slash
118:14 - IDs
118:15 - I think the minimax would fall under the
118:19 - code editor category I don't think
118:23 - they're considered IDs I don't use them
118:27 - though I mean I've tried out vim but I
118:29 - don't actively use them so I don't know
118:33 - maybe for some I know there are some
118:36 - people who watch a stream that do use
118:38 - them so please correct me if I'm wrong
118:41 - about that
118:59 - okay harsh it's asking a question about
119:01 - a specific piece of code so let me let
119:05 - me get this on the screen
119:18 - okay let me pull this over here all
119:23 - right so let's check this code out so
119:24 - Harsha's question is okay so she's a
119:35 - verified label I have set up GPG keys
119:39 - what do you think about this
120:10 - actually I've never used these before so
120:12 - let me see
120:34 - okay cool so I I mean I think that's
120:38 - cool that's fine to do what's the what's
120:41 - the main benefit of the GPG key
121:20 - well okay so earlier I mentioned Adobe
121:23 - XD I didn't I didn't know what the
121:24 - status of that was so it seems like the
121:26 - beta version is is still free so if I
121:30 - guess if you can get ahold of the beta
121:31 - version then then you could use it John
121:38 - Hanson says true Jesse talking about
121:40 - what you do and know is a great selling
121:43 - strategy I've had offers to build sites
121:45 - I've had to turn down as I've got my job
121:48 - beside some websites or beyond my skills
121:51 - yeah actually that that reminds me is
121:54 - well if even if you know other
121:56 - developers and get to talk to them they
122:00 - may send you projects like I know I've
122:03 - had people ask me about doing websites
122:08 - for them and I've just been too busy at
122:10 - the time and so I've passed those
122:12 - projects along to other developers that
122:15 - I know and sometimes it works out really
122:19 - well for those developers so if you get
122:22 - to know other developers and let them
122:25 - know that you're you're open annoying
122:28 - work if they trust you and they've seen
122:30 - what you can do and they know it's good
122:32 - work then they probably will have no
122:33 - problem sending people to you so that's
122:38 - that's another good way to find work
122:57 - heart should ask if I've installed
122:59 - compass not yet it finished downloading
123:01 - I didn't saw at the but Harsha says you
123:05 - should see the database structure there
123:06 - ok cool off to check it out
123:20 - let's see if this bulletin was a real
123:24 - project how much would you have charged
123:27 - okay let me think about this
123:31 - the bulletin so the bulletin site is
123:41 - basically a blog site right it's a blog
123:45 - site it's set up WordPress if two
123:47 - different servers to set up probably not
123:50 - going to run load balancing it's not
123:52 - that important that it needs it
123:55 - I set up the SSL now the complicated
124:03 - thing I guess is the login but we may
124:07 - even have more to login then we
124:10 - currently have depending on on what
124:11 - happens with the IT department here
124:15 - let's see we have custom stuff done on
124:21 - the WordPress end so there is going to
124:22 - be custom post types who are already
124:24 - running the graph QL plug-in so it's a
124:31 - significant project I mean this this
124:33 - would be this project I'm thinking right
124:38 - now obviously is depending on the
124:42 - organization and and fact there's you
124:44 - know such as my time and things like
124:47 - that but I'm thinking this website would
124:49 - probably end up being you know more
124:54 - closer to like a ten thousand dollar
124:59 - site so our baby set that as a minimum
125:01 - of 10,000 dollar site I mean that's just
125:06 - kind of off the top of my head if I was
125:07 - really gonna price this out I would I
125:09 - would sit down and so like you know I do
125:13 - with my Trello boards and I break things
125:16 - down if I was really gonna give an
125:18 - estimate I would break all the work down
125:20 - like that estimate how long I take
125:22 - everything factoring in the
125:25 - obviously delays that normally happen
125:27 - and the other stuff that you need to do
125:29 - on a project so but a very loose
125:32 - estimate would probably be I probably
125:34 - wouldn't do it for less than than 10,000
125:39 - so that would I mean and that also
125:42 - includes like you know I'm doing this
125:44 - for clients so there would be rigorous
125:45 - testing there would be training involved
125:47 - I would probably do training videos and
125:49 - some in-person training for whoever is
125:51 - going to be you know inputting the data
125:53 - so it's not necessarily just the
125:56 - development I would include that in the
125:58 - cost as well but anyway that's what I
126:02 - would charge now but they said it does
126:06 - really make a difference there are times
126:07 - when if I'm really busy and someone
126:11 - wants me to do a website I I'll quote
126:14 - them something more than I normally
126:16 - would because my time is more scarce
126:20 - therefore it's more valuable to me so to
126:24 - make it worth my while to work on that
126:26 - project which basically means for me is
126:28 - I'm not gonna see my family while I'm
126:30 - doing that work right so so for me it's
126:36 - I guess there's two there's two sides to
126:39 - the pricing is how much value can you
126:40 - bring to the client which is important
126:42 - because that's what they care about but
126:44 - then there's also how much do you value
126:46 - your own time which is also important
126:48 - because that's what you care about so
126:50 - you need to think about both things and
126:52 - as long as what you value your time to
126:56 - be corresponds roughly to what they
126:59 - think the value you're gonna bring to
127:01 - them through your website is going to be
127:03 - then everybody's happy
127:04 - right so you just gotta meet up you have
127:11 - to find clients that kind of match up
127:14 - with with that so I mean obviously when
127:17 - you're thinking about how much you're
127:18 - gonna charge like you do think about
127:20 - your own experience and your skills as
127:22 - well but because that will help you to
127:26 - convince people that you're worth that
127:28 - much anyway hopefully that helps I don't
127:33 - know how much would you all charge where
127:36 - you're from your area
127:38 - and your skill set what do you think so
127:40 - if anybody has any estimates I know it's
127:43 - really hard to make estimates right on
127:44 - the spot
127:45 - but if anybody has estimates about what
127:48 - it would be like in your area of the
127:50 - world in terms of price let me know I'm
127:53 - really interested to hear that
128:16 - okay so the GPG code just actually
128:18 - verifies that that's really the person
128:21 - that says it is okay cool
128:23 - that's what I figured I just kind of
128:25 - want to know if there was some other
128:26 - reason so yeah I like that that's cool
128:36 - dragon owner said you should do some
128:38 - podcasting you sound like an authority
128:40 - figure I don't know about that I don't
128:47 - actually have any authority
128:49 - I guess my if I have authority it would
128:52 - only be if if people value what I say
128:54 - that would be the only authority that I
128:56 - that I would have but I have experience
128:59 - though so for whatever that's worth like
129:03 - I can definitely give that
129:20 - michail says hey Jesse watching project
129:23 - 2 day 2 now and saw that you went live
129:25 - not really have a chance to watch online
129:27 - but thanks make good work keep it up
129:30 - Oh awesome thanks for stopping and in
129:32 - saying that I really appreciate that and
129:34 - hopefully you can join us live at some
129:36 - point and let me know what you think or
129:38 - any questions that you have we're
129:39 - suggestions but anyway yeah thanks again
129:44 - Blake says $10,000 as well
129:47 - Harshit says you know $10,000 is a year
129:50 - income in India I didn't know that but
129:56 - that's that's cool to know world says it
130:02 - used graph q oh and react yeah I mean
130:06 - think about I think that's an important
130:11 - point to remember a world sang use graph
130:13 - QL and reacts like a client might not
130:17 - necessarily know what graph QL and react
130:20 - is or even care but as a developer like
130:23 - we know the value in that that reacting
130:25 - graph QL are really the technologies
130:30 - that are I don't want to say emerging
130:33 - because Reax been around for a while and
130:34 - graph heels been around for a while but
130:36 - in terms of like very widespread
130:37 - adoption you know the vast majority of
130:42 - the internet is still jQuery territory
130:44 - right I mean as much as developers you
130:48 - know kind of want to stay away from it
130:49 - realistically it's used on a huge
130:52 - portion of the internet right so some of
130:54 - these newer technologies that aren't
130:58 - really new to us because we're
131:00 - developers but in the grand scheme of
131:01 - things in terms of how much they're
131:04 - really used on the internet they they
131:05 - are pretty new they're pretty cutting
131:07 - edge so the value of being able to use
131:12 - those technologies I think warrants a
131:17 - higher price tag now you may have
131:20 - trouble convincing the average person
131:22 - the average client of why this is
131:26 - important for their site how will this
131:28 - will help their site to be better right
131:31 - so
131:33 - while for a project like this maybe it
131:36 - would be hard to find a client who's
131:37 - willing to see the value in this and
131:39 - want to pay that much so but if I were
131:43 - to do a site that had everything that
131:44 - we're doing using all the technology
131:46 - that we're using I would want to charge
131:48 - at least $10,000
131:51 - so there's definitely that do I think I
131:54 - could find a client locally that would
131:56 - pay ten thousand no not in my local area
131:58 - could I find one somewhere else
132:00 - definitely I've no doubt about it I've I
132:04 - personally have have known I know what
132:10 - companies have paid for websites I've
132:12 - worked on those websites as a
132:14 - subcontractor I know so I I know enough
132:17 - to know that there are a lot of
132:19 - companies out there government
132:21 - organizations and institutions that are
132:23 - willing to pay an obscene amount of
132:25 - money for products that aren't even
132:27 - really that good
132:28 - so if you're starting out $10,000 seems
132:33 - like a lot especially if you're dealing
132:35 - with like local small businesses but
132:38 - when you get to another level of client
132:40 - which should be the goal he really want
132:42 - to make money when you get up there to
132:44 - the larger organizations ten thousand
132:47 - dollars is nothing to them you know
132:50 - you're they're dealing with budgets of
132:51 - millions of dollars so if they're gonna
132:55 - they're gonna drop a hundred thousand
132:57 - dollars on a website and budget that out
132:59 - and saying okay we're gonna do a website
133:01 - every three or four years we're gonna
133:03 - get an update a hundred thousand for
133:05 - this you know so it you know it breaks
133:07 - down to you know maybe 20,000 a year
133:10 - 25,000 a year and they're gonna think
133:12 - that's not really a big deal right that
133:14 - doesn't even cover our electric bills
133:16 - you know they're they're gonna think in
133:18 - terms of I'm gonna spend twenty five
133:22 - thousand dollars a year on a website I
133:24 - buy one truck for my company and it's
133:27 - probably gonna cost me $20,000 $25,000
133:30 - right and they're mine like you got to
133:34 - put it to them like that right the
133:35 - website is the public face of a business
133:37 - how much do people spend on building a
133:40 - building for their business and making
133:42 - it look nice millions right I'm
133:46 - have homes that are in the millions of
133:47 - dollars so a business to build their
133:49 - actual physical business will think
133:52 - nothing about spending millions on it
133:54 - their website they're going to be able
133:56 - to reach more people so put in terms
133:58 - like that of how important it is ten
134:03 - thousand dollars is nothing I can come
134:05 - out with ten thousand dollars to some
134:07 - companies and they would laugh at me and
134:08 - say no because they're thinking the work
134:12 - that this guy's doing must be terrible
134:14 - if he thinks he can only get ten
134:15 - thousand dollars off of this right so
134:18 - when you when you're thinking about
134:20 - things like that don't get discouraged
134:26 - try to think in terms of what what are
134:32 - the budgets for these companies you know
134:35 - now if you're dealing with a really
134:37 - small business that has three employees
134:40 - and stuff yeah don't walk her in and say
134:42 - I'm gonna build your website and it's
134:44 - gonna cost ten thousand dollars they're
134:45 - gonna say you got to be kidding me like
134:48 - my rent every month is less than a
134:49 - thousand dollars I'm not going to pay
134:51 - you ten thousand dollars for a website
134:54 - because potentially that could be around
134:56 - here where I live
134:57 - that's really it's reasonable as some
135:00 - people have really low rents for their
135:02 - buildings so because the area is so
135:04 - depressed and other areas the United
135:05 - States that's kind of ridiculous but
135:08 - anyway just try to think like I mean I
135:12 - guess I'm trying to like give you a
135:14 - little pep talk at least to keep your
135:16 - mind open to the reality of what
135:19 - businesses spend and how they're
135:22 - thinking and what they are already
135:24 - paying for products so don't sell
135:27 - yourself short just because something
135:31 - might seem easy right to us building
135:33 - this there have been some there's been
135:35 - some trouble right there's been some
135:37 - hard things right that grid layout that
135:39 - masonry layout was a pain for Harshit to
135:41 - put in and the the author the whole
135:45 - authorization login system was really
135:47 - impressive and that took some time but
135:51 - really for us this seems like oh no big
135:54 - deal we do this every day but there's
135:56 - not a whole lot of people in the world
135:58 - that can
135:58 - this kind of thing and and do it
136:00 - professionally and be trustworthy and
136:02 - have it work and be able to handle a lot
136:05 - of people that there's value in that
136:10 - especially yeah big businesses see value
136:12 - in that so don't sell yourself short
136:15 - anyway I keep going off on these big
136:18 - tangents I need to just make this
136:19 - freelancing video and and then direct
136:21 - you all to that or my live streams are
136:23 - gonna end up being three hours long
136:25 - every day okay okay so for this same
136:34 - project rollin is saying in India if he
136:38 - were to try to sell the same project he
136:41 - would charge about three thousand five
136:43 - hundred US dollars equivalent now in
136:47 - India
137:04 - Rowland says there really isn't much
137:06 - demand for webpages or services here in
137:08 - India small businesses will go for the
137:09 - cheapest bidder and large companies have
137:12 - their own team or will contract with the
137:14 - whole team John Hanson says great advice
137:19 - awesome thanks for that yeah I mean
137:22 - hopefully the worst the client can say
137:25 - if you come out with a really outrageous
137:27 - offer that's our offer that seems
137:30 - outrageous to them you know a quote for
137:32 - a price the worst they can do is say no
137:34 - but you know so what they say no maybe
137:41 - you don't really want to work for a
137:43 - company that doesn't value what you do
137:45 - enough to pay you would what the work is
137:48 - really worth so so you just don't be
137:52 - afraid it's a bad path to go down to
137:55 - constantly be apprehensive about what a
137:57 - client's gonna think is reasonable and
137:59 - try to always undercut yourself because
138:02 - you go down that path and where does it
138:04 - stop you end up doing quality work for
138:07 - less money than you should and then you
138:11 - get the type of client who doesn't value
138:12 - your work so even though you know you're
138:15 - giving them a great deal they don't
138:17 - understand that and that's not really
138:19 - the type of client you want to be
138:20 - involved with I've been there I've been
138:22 - involved with that type of client you're
138:24 - giving them a great deal and and they're
138:25 - trying and then at the end of the day
138:27 - what they do is they try to you know if
138:31 - if you're saving them a thousand dollars
138:33 - off of what they would pay they're still
138:35 - gonna try to squeeze out you know an
138:37 - extra hundred dollars off you in the end
138:39 - and said well I'm not paying for this
138:40 - because something's off with it right
138:43 - that's what that's what ends up
138:46 - happening so just go for good quality
138:52 - clients that are willing to pay with
138:54 - something's worth and you'll be much
138:55 - happier if you have to take the the
138:58 - cheaper stuff to build your portfolio up
139:01 - there's nothing wrong with that if you
139:02 - have to take some of that stuff to pay
139:04 - the bills and take care of your family
139:06 - there's nothing wrong with that I've
139:07 - been there and I've done that but when
139:09 - you get to a point where you're
139:11 - comfortable enough with your finances
139:13 - that you can afford to take some risks
139:15 - go for the bigger clients and then
139:17 - once you get there and get those clients
139:19 - in your portfolio it'll be a lot easier
139:24 - uh okay let's see Blake says thanks did
139:33 - you see the link for the repo I did not
139:39 - see the link for the repo did you paste
139:43 - them in live chat I missed it
139:49 - if you could paste it again that'd be
139:50 - great I could try to go back through and
139:52 - look for it but it'll be more of a sure
139:55 - thing if you could paste it again Oh
140:03 - Harshit says yes you tried doing UI for
140:05 - emails tomorrow if you really want me to
140:08 - do you eyes for email I will do that but
140:11 - for those of you that have worked on UI
140:13 - for emails you understand where I'm
140:15 - coming from I'm sure if you haven't
140:17 - you'll see it's not it's not the easiest
140:21 - thing but I'll do it if that's what if
140:24 - this what you all want to see okay cool
140:27 - thanks Blake I got the URL now all right
140:36 - haha world says companies aren't
140:39 - apprehensive in selling you a smartphone
140:40 - for a thousand dollars yeah you're
140:43 - absolutely right I mean think about
140:45 - think about what companies expect you
140:47 - all to pay for their services and then
140:52 - you know maybe it'll make it easier for
140:57 - you to to charge them more
141:13 - all right so a Blake Blake let me know
141:17 - what in particular you want me to check
141:18 - out on this on this repo and I'll try to
141:21 - check it out
141:22 - and you can you don't have to tell me
141:24 - now if you want to make an issue on the
141:27 - repo then we could like we could talk
141:29 - about it you know in the comments of
141:31 - that issue if you want however you want
141:33 - to do it
141:54 - okay well I'm to the end of the live
141:59 - chat now I think we had a great chat we
142:01 - probably spent more time talking than we
142:02 - did with coding but today I feel like is
142:06 - the first time in a while that we
142:07 - accomplished everything that we wanted
142:08 - to accomplish actually a little bit more
142:11 - I didn't even expect to do the masonry
142:13 - layout and get that all merged in so we
142:15 - actually accomplished even more I know I
142:17 - ended up talking a lot so sorry if it
142:21 - was too much but I hope I helped some of
142:24 - you out and sharing my experiences with
142:27 - with freelancing but this dream has been
142:32 - really long and I'm actually like really
142:35 - hot and sweating right now because it's
142:37 - all in my office I didn't want to turn
142:38 - the fan on and mess up the audio so I've
142:42 - got to get a drink and get out of this
142:43 - office my wife just called me too so I'm
142:48 - gonna see what she needs and I'll be
142:51 - back tomorrow thank you so much for all
142:55 - your help
142:56 - Harshit especially thank you in
142:58 - Sebastian for your pool requests you all
143:01 - have been great and I mean Harshit I
143:04 - knew you're talking about freelancing
143:06 - stuff and you're still a student and
143:07 - you're young so that makes it hard but
143:09 - you have skills
143:10 - you definitely have skills so you just
143:15 - need the right connections and I think
143:17 - you'll be fine and in terms of doing
143:20 - work right now though when you're young
143:21 - this is a great opportunity to study and
143:24 - work on those side projects that you
143:26 - really really want to if you need the
143:29 - money I totally understand if you got to
143:31 - take some projects but otherwise I
143:32 - wouldn't worry about freelancing so much
143:34 - right now I would worry I would try to
143:37 - take advantage of this time in your life
143:39 - to work on things that you really want
143:41 - to work on because once you start
143:43 - working for clients you don't have the
143:45 - same amount of freedom like you could
143:46 - now so but anyway I think you have a lot
143:50 - of talent and I think so many of you in
143:53 - the live chat and the watch the shows
143:55 - have so much talent I'm always impressed
143:57 - with with which you all show me so
144:00 - anyway thank you and I will be back
144:06 - tomorrow
144:07 - so until then
144:08 - have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jessie and today we're going to try to get the authorization working the user login for our app and so I've done some troubleshooting today and I think I've ruled out the the email as the issue so yesterday we were thinking that there was maybe a port that was blocked that was stopping emails from working but that's not the case so I was able to test that out and on the master branch I don't have the login implemented but the email is there when you submit the form that I was going to show you but I can't log in right now so if we could log in there's a form all right so we can get to it on the master branch I can submit it successfully and I can get the email so that works so it's not the email so we have to look elsewhere so I did kind of scatter i scattered console logs all over the place throughout some of our node files here and I didn't I didn't come up with any definitive but I think it may have something to do with the database connection let me show you my my logs here so this is what I keep getting let's see here we go so this this error is is coming from client dot J s that's the area that I keep getting every time I try to log in so between what I was able to do with all the console logs and be able to successfully send emails and this error message that leads me to believe that maybe it has something to do with how we're interacting with with that database so I figure that's not a bad place to start with our troubleshooting so let's it was not much to see here just you know we can submit see actually let me restart this because we're not gonna get this will refresh all right let me check the live chat before we get started and then I'll start my timer and we'll do 25 minutes of in this case troubleshooting we may or not may or may not be writing that much code so you could see this is this is what happens when you submit we just keep getting the same error sorry it's just everything set up hey everybody CEO saying hey air in the live chat sebastian is asking if the the pool request he submitted to fix that UI glitch that was happening with the the drop down for to log out so i did emerge in that pool request i as far as i know it was working alright i didn't have time to test it that much so it was only really minimal changes just to CSS so i figured there's no harm in and merging it in but my take truth my browser stack has been insanely slow lately so if you're not familiar browser stack you can run you can test your websites on all different types of browser operating system device combinations so it's like you through your browser you can log in to these other devices and test it so for whatever reason it's just been really weird and slow and hard to test so i didn't test it yet just because I'm tired of the frustration of working with that so anyway it's it's in the master branch now so if anyone once has the code on your machine and you're running an on Mac please let me know if you see anything weird when you click on that that menu to logout but I think it should be fun okay all right so I have some some comments pertaining to the troubleshooting so let's just go right into that and and check out these comments I'm going to start my timer after this 25 minutes is up I'm going to take five minutes and go through the questions in the live chat so if you ask a question I will get to it eventually just hang in there and and you'll get your answer if you can't stick around for the answer just check out the recording of this video which will be available here on the free code camp YouTube channel shortly after I finished the stream alright so okay so Paco asks did you try to connect your mom go on another port okay no I haven't let's see and Harshit is asking about a user I've already created a user in the in the database so I'm using M lab just the free version of M lab just to set up a testing database so I do have a user created and that's the the user that I'm working with for for my database so where you have to put in your database user and password that's that's what I am using okay Sebastian followed up with initially talking about pull requests yes the white space was gone so there's no white space any there anymore they're on a Mac so that that issue was cleared up so thank you let's see okay so I'm trying to I'm trying to sort out Harshit is the one that that coded this pretty much everything having to do with the back end was done by Harsha so I'm trying to read these comments helping me out here so so harsh it's saying check your dot and file okay so what what do I need to check the string I have checked the string it's it's worth doublechecking okay I should saying to use use his connection string okay let's see I have my dot M file open on my other screen obviously so that I don't show everybody all my stuff to okay cool so harsh it's going to message me the info so that I can I can try it with with his database info that's actually a good idea and then that old that should help us narrow down the issue okay so let me see while I'm waiting on on a Harsha send me that info okay cool I just got it anyway I was going to say when we probably later on whenever I finish up with the coding and we do a question and answer session I'm gonna let you know how everything went with that react native that just to make a lungs long story short it passed the code review so it's officially accepted I've completed all the project for that nano degree which is awesome there's definitely a lot of work that I still would like to do on it and I got some really great feedback from my reviewers so I maybe I might actually turn that into some issues on the github repo and then if anybody would like to work on it with me then at least you'll know some of the things that need the need work alright so I got Harshit I got your your info I'm going to paste that now into my dot and file okay I'm saving that and let me let me restart this so you start this wait for that to refresh okay alright let's give this a shot now okay so waiting okay not sent let's see yep we got the same same error okay so since this same login info works for Harshit on his machine then it's probably it probably doesn't have anything to do with my my login credentials for the database it has something to do I guess with my development environment so well at least we've we've ruled that out okay okay hard sing hard code the string for now okay I can hard code it I will I'll do that on my other screen let's see actually let me yeah okay oops we first that okay still same there well almost the same we had a bit more up here the last time Eric connecting the TV interesting I'm going to try that one more time I'm just wondering why we got different messages okay okay hmm all right I'm gonna get off of this I don't want that off day Esther refresh and show harsh it's trying to use memory store for now I'll different Express session okay physically listen reacts yeah so dragon hunter the the repo is bulletin react okay so harsh is saying try to use a memory store for now from Express session okay you're gonna have to help me out with that because I've this is the first time I've used and Express so let's see okay so I'm going to remove i'll go from exposition I make that big here sorry that was probably too small for everybody I had it smaller earlier there we go okay okay so harsh the same I'm removing so I'm not sure exactly where to remove if if I remove this will that do the trick are there other places where I need to remove it from I'm gonna take that out now and I figured I'd get some sort of error okay so first we remove that okay cool okay so there's another place where we have to do this that's okay dragon hunter the branch someone right now is it's actually harsh it's pull request let me let me send you what PR is that 44 let me send you the get command I'm going to take by the gate command if anybody does want to check this out but you're not familiar with how to do this I'm just going to type it right into the live chat it's get fetch origin pull 44 and then age okay so get fetch origin pool and then 44 I'll put this up on the screen too if anybody wants to see this later on so this is what I'm doing git fetch origin pool so you're gonna pull request number 44 and then head and then at the end here you can name this whatever you want but that's what the branch is going to be called on your local machine so this is what I named it on my local machine but you can name it whatever you want after you pull this down you can switch to that branch make sure you run npm install or yarn because there's a lot of packages and then you should be able to to work on on this or at least follow follow along with what we're doing okay all right so let me go back to this John Hanson says I remember seeing something when using react with express and connecting through MongoDB there can be a shared connection issue between Express and react which can default on the same localhost 3000 okay so maybe maybe we're dealing with with a known issue here that's good to know because there'll probably be some some information about how how to fix it down let DVD compass see where was let me let me go back one so there was one other thing that I had to comment out well let's connect to the database from a GUI first okay we compass be able to could I use instead of compass the bongo DB compass could I just use the command line could I use the shell let me pull pull one over to my other screen here Harshit saying it will be very hard as you don't have longer that well wedding we should I mean all we really need to test is whether or not I can actually connect right so that that might be the only reason I'm asking is because I don't want to go through the to get the free version of Compass TV compass is like you gotta fill out all your contact info and everything so I was just going to try to avoid that and I wanted to download the show anyway oh here we go found another place where it's gonna let me download it without that alright I'll try that then I don't know what that other page was but it wanted a lot of contact info okay oh yeah now it's making me do this again I'm gonna show so I'm trying to install the shell but the the documentation page was just saying how to use it and not how to install it cool I think I could just use brew to install this let's see okay so I'm gonna try to use homebrew homebrew to install this okay cool let's see all right harsh dude I got your link I'm going to open this on my other screen okay so if you're just joining us you're not sure what's going on when installing some tools to help us test our database connection so I have a few things going right now so whatever tool ends up getting downloaded faster is what we're going to use all right so the compass is has three minutes left on the download homebrew is now about 15% done downloading so so we'll see see what happens it's a race so if you've never used homebrew here's what's going on here so if you're on a Mac you can use homebrew to install packages so there are different reasons why you might want to use home homebrew but it can be it can be useful so I just ran brew update which just updated homebrew it's good good there if you don't run homebrew often it's a good idea to just do a brew update every time you're going to install something new and then I'm doing brew install MongoDB so waiting on that looks like it's still saying three minutes left on the Compass something like the the home brew install might might win the race here okay let's see harsh harsh is saying check out all changes you might have done some breaking change is possible all I really added in were console logs and I think I actually got rid of all those so it should be everything should be exactly the same I can always pull the pull the branch down again sirrah mad okay all right so now we reverted all right so we do have Brian's asking about homebrew so while we're waiting for this to install we may as well talk about number so homebrew helps you it's been a while since I even read anything about homebrew but from what I remember when I was first researching this homebrew who helps you use C you install these packages but you do it in a way that protects your system so I don't know if sandboxing is the right word but I guess it's it's somewhat similar to that also it makes it easier really easy to update things so like if you install yarn through homebrew and you want to update yarn you just run the update through homebrew so there's no sometimes yarn for whatever reason can be tricky at least I've it's been tricky for me probably because on some of my scenes I use homebrew and some of machines I use I installed it other ways so anyway I'm gonna do my 5minute break now and I'll just continue talking about homebrew for a minute here but it just kind of makes it easy to be able I mean you can see a lot of the packages here that are available this kind of simplifies installing packages you know you don't have to go like read the docs on how to manually install any of these it just it's there and it works so anyway I don't use it for everything but it is convenient for some things all right let me scroll up and see what questions you all have and try to answer as many as I can here in this little break Oh Goo's says I can't learn vanilla JavaScript could you guys help me yeah I would say if you're having trouble with vanilla JavaScript I mean you can certainly ask any questions here in the live chat or you know ask me questions on Twitter or something like that but I think checking out free code camps javascript exercises is a good way to get your hang of get the hang of all the syntax and run through some algorithms and things there are other great resources so code Academy has some nice like in browser tutorials and there's certainly a lot of YouTube videos there's a great JavaScript series here on free code camps channel that that Bo recorded so you know check that out there's also some good open source books so the you don't know J S series is available for free on github that's a great series so there's a lot of different things you could do to learn JavaScript it kind of depends on your preferred learning style I would say for me things I like the videos and I like reading and all that and the in browser exercises but I don't feel like I really get them the concepts and so I start to use it in my own projects and and need to modify things you know based on the project requirements then I find myself really getting the hang of these different concepts so no matter what you do to learn at first I would try to spend some time every day just you know a little bit of time every day actually using those concepts if you can it'll be much easier to keep those learn those concepts and remember them if you do a little bit every day as opposed to you know maybe taking one day a week and spending hours learning so that's that's just kind of some basic advice if you're having issues with a specific part of JavaScript you know that you know or let us know here in the live chat and I mean we could help you with that okay Blake asked about end rock at the beginning and Rock is the the service that I'm using to be able to let you all see on your computer in your browser the projects that I'm working on locally and you can inspect them however it's not really going to be of that much use right now because of the way we have the servers running so we will be using it in the future but for right now it's not it's not really gonna work and it has nothing to do with n grog and rocks working perfectly it's just what we have one on right now with the project Fernando says I'm from Argentina I need a job Fernando let's see if you if you're on Twitter and you wanna if you send me a tweet with I'm sorry if you tagged me in a tweet that maybe has a link to your github repository or your portfolio website and just saying the tweet like you know I'm looking for work this is what I do I'd be happy to retweet you I don't have that many followers I'm like just under 600 right now but maybe some of my followers may retweet as well and some of my followers do have a lot more followers on their account so that may help I don't I don't know of any jobs available right now and I'm not really in a position to make hiring decisions on my own where I'm working right now but I'd be more than happy to just try to get your name out there on Twitter a little bit more so my link to my Twitter account or at least my name on Twitter is is in the description for this video okay all right so that time is up let's do one more session hopefully we can get things something figured out in this session so let me scroll back down and let me grab let's see I have all my database info open on another screen so let me grab this and paste this in here okay all right so now that I have the shell I'm going to let me get all the all the info in here just to just take me just a second I'm going to I'm going to build the string that I need to put in there on my other screen and then I'll paste it into the terminal okay so I'm not I'm not going to do this on the screen I'm doing some another screen because I have all my database info in here but right now it's it's in the process of connecting so let's see what happens I don't know how long it normally takes to connect okay actually interesting okay so we I did get by an error that gives me a little bit more information here hmm okay so is definitely the problem I think is with connecting to the database let's see oh there's a lot of capital letters in the live chat right now so let's see what har should say okay so harsh is saying that we should run a local database all right so let's do this start dB okay okay all right so we've started MongoDB let's see changing to mondo vocalist bulletin okay all right let's whoops okay so let me let me repeat what's going on in the live chat here sorry I think I've been pretty silent trying to read this so for everybody they can't see the live chat so what we're going to try to do is locally run a database so DB which we can do now since we installed everything so we're going to start this so we've run on my other screen I guess I could pull this over now because I don't have any special there we go okay so let me the the zoom one i therm is a little odd but anyway alright so I was pasting the wrong stuff in here but basically an R should let me know so I did Bruce services start MongoDB and it started a database and then I mistakenly pasted this in here before I saw your comment about where to put that so let's yeah okay so I've done the brewery services start MongoDB and I'm gonna put I'm going to change the dot n file okay so I've changed the database in the dot M file all right now let's restart the server whoops I have it here oh no sorry start this up rates alright as soon as this refreshes we'll test it out okay I'm seeing some hopeful things in the console yes I hate okay so it says the email has been sent let me verify that I have my email upon on the other screen and yes okay I have the token and let me grab this token and we'll paste it in over here so everyone can see awesome all right really cool so let me recap just I guess I didn't need to zoom in that much but let's recap would just happen so our it seems that our whole problem for the last or at least not not our problem it works your Harshit right away but for me for some reason and possibly this has to do with with my network here although I did try it on another network so maybe it's not I'm not sure what the issue is but for whatever reason we couldn't connect to the database that I was trying to run through a service called M lab so instead we installed with homebrew and then we just started up locally a database then I replace the local database in our DB hosts and our dot M file and that's the dot n files where you put information that you want to pull in as variables but you want to keep that secret so you don't put the dot end file in your github repo and nobody ever sees that okay get it it allows you to pull that into your source code but it remains hidden and you can still have things in your repository on github and you don't have to risk exposing API keys or passwords or anything like that so anyway so we changed our den file and then we're able to connect to the database so the authorization works as stated and you know exactly how how it was supposed to work so thanks harsh it great job on that so awesome well this is awesome so what I wanted let's let's test some of this out right great so you see we were able to log in let's check out let's check out where this is being stored at you have this on local storage or in cookies cool all right so okay heart should say we should test the form submission that's a good idea so the form submission was working before let's test it again just to make sure I'm just gonna put some things in here and submit all right submitted let's double check my email yep I got it actually let's try to do that with a file as well so let's see let's send so I'm gonna send something okay this is reasonably thin this is something that a PDF is something something we'll probably get sent frequently so all right and okay cool when the attachment did come through great awesome okay okay so all that works all right so we may as well merge this now so let's go back to our our console and what I'm gonna do first and I always do this always do this when I have branches that I'm merging is first we're going to merge master into our other branch and then if something really goes wrong at least we haven't messed up our master branch right so let's do get merge master all right why are you up to date I actually merged beforehand so I was almost positive that was going to work sometimes you may have merged conflicts in this case there was there was nothing harsh it does a good job of keeping everything merged so anyway let's go let's do a git checkout master up master and now we'll get merge h off great okay let me just double check we should be all up to date with our packages but never hurts to run it again great we are up to date and now we'll do a git push origin master all right that's going to push our code up to github and then if anybody happens to be looking at this pull request it will change from open to merge whenever we do this so we don't even have to do anything in github right from the command line it's it's going to be taken care of all right great okay now here's the thing though we there's some things that will probably change just so that we can all work on this and test it out so for instance right now you have to put in a Franciscan University email address now granted you could have it sent to mail trap so like there are ways but I think it's it's probably a good idea to make some changes hopefully I can get those changes done today probably not doing the stream just to make it possible I guess to skip the login since we know it works basically so y'all can get in and you're locally on your machines and do you know check out other things and do other type of work so we'll see about that so for now just be aware that it's going to make you log in now if you try to download this okay so let me bring over I guess I don't have to bring over I just want to grab one more pull request and that's the last one that we currently have open which it feels really good to get all these pull requests taken care of I've been so behind on getting things merged and really it was it was this request that we just sorted out now that was making me fall behind the most I just kept trying to troubleshoot and didn't realize until we're there today that it was most likely a database thing okay so let's grab this poor request 47 and this is where har should implemented the masonry layout if you're not familiar with that it with what that is hopefully you'll see an example in just a minute so let's do a git fetch origin pool 47 since it's pool requests 47 Ted and then we'll call this H masonry all right you don't have to name it H masonry you can name it whatever you want but I kind of like to put the first letter of the name of the person who's doing the pool request and then it just helps me keep straight who who did what and it helps me to be able to remember and give credit to the a person for doing this pool request so now let's check out let's do a get check out that new branch that we just created masonry and now whoops I keep forgetting I have the have a sent another screen recognized for your component oops I got to do a yarn it's a good idea to just run yarn all the time when you're pulling that down because if you don't need it it won't hurt anything but if you do need it it'll prevent you from maybe trying to troubleshoot something that you really shouldn't have to worry about because it should have been all taken care of oops let's try to restart before we do anything else okay great this is another thing that I found just from experience when you update when you switch to a new branch and you run yarn sometimes it's a good idea just to restart your server I know I've been very frustrated for a minute when things don't work and then luckily just a restart has been able to fix everything so try to do those two things run yarn or run NPM install and then restart the server before you try to troubleshoot anything it could save you a lot of time I know I've wasted a lot of time when I've forgotten to do that okay so anyway here's what we're talking about with masonry layout check that out that's just that looks cool write that all the cards just kind of flow so we had we talked about CSS grid so maybe it would be a good idea to explain the differences between what's going on here and CSS grid because certainly CSS grid is much more simple to to implement but what we had when we had the the grid was first initially when we implemented the grid we had these big gaps so we would have you know one two three and then our second row of three wouldn't start till here so it looked okay for these cards but then for this card there is this big white space then Harshit was able to set a uniform height for these and that got rid of our gaps but then on cards like this we would have a huge white space within the card so what what masonry does and behind the scenes what's going on here is using some JavaScript to position these so this is not CSS positioning each one of these actually has a position I mean I can you can actually see it happening in the console let's see maybe try to get to the right spot here and okay I guess the the first card is not really that useful to look at because all right so let me let me make this a bit bigger see all can can see it and then it'll be it'll be really obvious what's going on behind the scenes in just a second so let's bring this over I'm looking right here at this this positioning so it's absolute position right now it's left four hundred and some four and twenty six pixels top zero so as we move you can see the pixels changing so that's three eighteen three fifty so and now we have our top change so the absolute positioning is constantly changing based on the screen the screen size so that's that's the difference there is the CSS grid of course is CSS based positioning and this is certainly it uses CSS right which we're saying positionabsolute left top those are CSS attributes but javascript is directly controlling those so anyway that's how you deal with masonry masonry can be a pain at times I know in previous projects we had implemented this with react before and it took a while to get that that was with project one it took it took a little while to get it working and I've tried to implement this with with some jQuery stuff before it's definitely it can be a pain at times especially if you have images to get the positioning correct you you need to be able to have everything get repositioned whenever the image is actually load there's a helper library for that as well but there's a lot of different things that could go when you're using this but I think the end result is is worth it and there's cool things you could do with this like like filtering to you know have things just switch around you know on the fly it looks nice there's different types of transitions that you could use so this there's different options so anyway really nice great work on that hard I really like that and you can see you know our ListView is still just regular ListView but when we go back to grid view much nicer so great that's great job and we should have the same thing here when we go to our categories as well right now we don't really have enough posts to be able to see you know the full grid in action here but very nice okay let me check my time all right so this I'm almost done with this 25 minutes so I'm just going to go into the live chat now and answer some of your questions so basically we've achieved what we met what we wanted to achieve we've successfully troubleshooted what was wrong with our auth and with our log in system and the problem ended up being just for some reason I can't connect to a remote database so we had to run it locally so everything seems to be working with that we're able to get this grid layout in and I guess we could merge that in right now as well since I have a minute left it'll only take a minute to merge so let's go ahead and and merge that while we're here so first let's do a git merge master all right we have a conflict all right this is cool I'm really glad we had a conflict ok hard saying to try the logout ok cool off shar the logout let me finish this merge and then we'll try that ok Harshit also wants to make sure that that it is known that to use materialized for masonry yeah I did see that that comment in your pool request so how should saying is a real pain yeah I do I appreciate all the work I mean I I know I've I've had a lot of pain in dealing with this as well both with react and with without react with with some javis a query based single page apps that I made before before I started streaming so I definitely appreciate all the work that went into that so let's um let's see oops trying to find oh here we go alright where's their merge conflict that it was in that CSS file was it not okay alright cool so here if you've never seen a conflict emerge conflict it can look different depending on what editor you're using but basically you're gonna have sections from each and then you're gonna have a section where it gets kind of telling you here's what we think it should look like and so you get to choose what you want so let's check out what's going on here so our head is going to be our current branch so our current branch is that masonry branch so whatever branch your own is the head and then our other branches our master branch so that's what we have currently on a master branch so probably what we want to do is keep whatever's in the master branch so yeah we don't want all this stuff so what we're gonna do then is use master ok so you won't always have that option it does depend on what you're doing with your or what kind of editor you're using my packages that you have so you may have to manually get rid of manually delete that but in this case we can just click use me and it handles it for us which is nice so now we have this padding right important I do believe we want to keep that but let's see oh no we do we need that we have it on body let me double check so let's double check in I guess I can just run this on the on my other screen let me double check quickly what we have here yes oops I need index that's CSS okay we are gonna keep that we are gonna keep this right let me check the live chat quickly Sebastian will know more than anyone whether or not we need to keep this so Sebastian if you're still with us in the live chat let me know I mean this is not really a big deal this is not hard to go back in and change this let's see we'll just we'll keep this in for now if we notice that something weird is happening with it we can always take it out but anyway now I've saved that and we can see if we go back in here we're gonna commit so let me double check and make sure ok was just with index it'll tell you what files have have conflicts so since it was just indexed on CSS we fix those conflicts let's go in here and get commit I'm gonna do a git commit I'm gonna put the commit message right in line here and say okay it's running our tests great okay awesome so the merge has worked now let's well let's quickly just double check and make sure everything's working I don't really have any reason to think that it wouldn't work but worth a shot and then we can also test out our logout as well all right looks good looks good great what else did we have this bad all right wonderful all right let's test our logout okay great we're able to log out and we'll just test a login great that was nice and quick we have our our token here and awesome loves us right back in wonderful okay now let's do get checkout master and we'll do a git merge H mace H masonry awesome now we have the masonry branch here and we can do a git master awesome so now everything should be uptodate we'll have all our pull requests merge for the bulletins react wonderful okay we do still have we have one issue open and there's certainly more that needs to be done so maybe I'll try to add some more issues in here so if anybody would like to work on them you can work on them if anybody needs to get those last few pull requests in before for hack tober fast to get your tshirt maybe I'll try to put in some some some of them are going to be more difficult some of the issues maybe you'll try to put in some easy ones if anybody's kind of new to coding but still wants to get the pull requests in also I still don't have all my pull requests in so if anybody has a project that you need some help with and would like me to open a pull request for your project let me know send me a link to your repository and let me know what need what you need work on so now that I've finished my class I may have a little extra time to work on stuff like that so I probably won't be able to like do anything really significant but you all helped me out so much it'd be cool if I could help you out with something as well all right so let me go through the live chat now and that'll be the last thing that we do let's see so if you have any questions please put them in the live chat now I'll do my best to answer all the questions if you don't have a question please consider sticking around and helping to answer some of the questions I'd love to have your expertise to help give the best answers we can to everybody that's that's asking questions but if you can't stick around you can always catch the Q&A session later in the recording and please join us again tomorrow should be around the same time today was a little later than normal but I like to stream around 2 p.m. Eastern Time we may will probably end up working on some UI stuff tomorrow I haven't decided for sure but maybe we'll work on some of that we've had some heavy backend stuff lately so it might be nice to switch it up do some some front end you know CSS work so but let me know if anybody as anything specifically they'd really like me to go over tomorrow let me know in the live chat right now or send me a message on Twitter and if if it's doable within the scope of the project I'd be more than happy to to steer the stream in that direction okay let me find where I left off there we are oh you know before I forget yesterday I had I think it was harsh it asked about freelancing and then I had someone on Twitter as well asked about freelancing so we'll see how much time the question/answer takes maybe I'll talk about it now but I've been thinking maybe I should do a video a short video and put it on my own YouTube channel about my experience as a freelancer and my advice to anybody that wants to be a freelance web developer so if you think you might be interested in that let me know if nobody's really interested maybe I won't take the time to do it but otherwise if you think it might be helpful for you I did freelance I was a freelance web developer for three years so and I still do freelancing on the side so I'm certainly not the best there is but I have a lot of you know experience about five years of experience so that at least I could give you some advice over the areas where I made mistakes in some of the areas where I was successful all right still I'm scrolling down looking for questions a lot of this section of live chat I was interacting a lot during the the coding so things that we've already talked about I'm just kind of skipping it over okay actually Rohan has a good comment here so previously we were talking about homebrew and I was trying to explain a little bit about what it does but I like what Rohan says here he says homebrew is a package manager for apps for mac just like NPM is for node packages so on Linux you would have apps and YUM so if you think of it like that I think that's definitely on the right track that'll make it easier if you've never done anything with homebrew basically the same thing does a very similar thing and then what is I forget the one that's for PHP but PHP has something similar okay rook asks if there's a Windows counterpart for homebrew Rowan says it's chocolaty okay that's awesome I've actually didn't know that I haven't really done anything on Windows for a few years now but when I did a lot of development on Windows I had no idea so that's that's awesome so for everyone on a Mac check out homebrew for as a package manager but if you're on a Windows machine check out chocolaty hug harsh it reminded me that my timer was not visible so sorry about that I always forget I just I gotta get used to putting it somewhere else I'm seeing all the horseshit trying to get my attention typing in in all caps so sorry for all the stress that my inattention cost you there I appreciate you being persistent in trying to get my attention though okay earlier I was checking I think I was checking on a different screen but I was mentioning local storage and cookies so I wanted to know where the where the login information was being stored so if you didn't if you didn't catch that I was able to log in on this tab and then this tab was still on the login screen and I just refreshed I was automatically logged in basically there's a cookie stored now currently the the live version of this that's a non react very uses local storage to accomplish the same thing basically to store user data so that the login session can persist so as long as you don't log out or clear your cookies then it should persist so actually not sure is if anyone has any opinion on which is better to use cookies or to use local storage let me know I'd be interested to see if there's if there's some good reason to use one or the other I know I believe cookies that have to be smaller so you have the opportunity to store more in local storage in this case we're not really storing that much so it shouldn't be an issue but if anyone's work with that or has any opinion on that please let me know okay Harshit earlier i was talking about how there might be an issue for for someone else to log in and Harshit said i i was setting up said you said that you need the franciscan needy you offguard i simply implemented it yeah yeah don't worry i'm not upset that you implemented it i'm actually really glad that you did that because that's exactly what we need for when this goes live I was just trying to think of an easy way for other people to be able to contribute to the project maybe without having to set up a database and everything because I still want this to be as beginnerfriendly as possible you know there's some there's some little things that people who are new could could contribute to the project but they may not be able to figure out I mean I did a whole database thing I needed your help to figure that out as well so I just wanted to try to think of some way to make it a bit easier so I'm thinking maybe maybe I could put something into where it checks whether it's in development mode or production and if it's in dev mode we just disabled the log in and then if it's in production then then it is enabled and then that might be the better way so we'll definitely still want to enable it and test it before we go live with it but when we're doing like UI work and things maybe we can just just disable that I know it's a tional II it's a pain like on the live version if I want to use I have authentication enabled all the time even if I'm running it locally and it's tough if I use like browser stack to test the browsers and browsers that don't have my local storage data so I have to log in I have another email sent and log in again on every different machine I want to be on if I want to test it on a phone or something like that so I end up having to log in quite a bit so it be cool if we came up with a simple way to disable the login for testing purposes so anyway I just don't want you to think that that was wrong to implement that that was perfect that was exactly what I wanted okay rooks asking what all those warnings actually mean the incorrect peer dependency yeah let's check that out but look at all these things all right let me read down and see if anybody else said anything and see okay I don't it looks like dragon hunter said I can RM RF node modules and then run yarn so would that get rid of this I'll try that out okay so actually this would be cool to run so if you end up having weird problems with your node modules I have done this in the past and it has fixed some of my problems it doesn't always but occasionally basically this is like completely wiping out all your node modules and reinstalling everything and starting from scratch let's do it it's not gonna hurt the project it's just going to take a couple minutes to get everything back but what you're using so we're going to use this RM RF oops RF do not use this unless you're really sure because what this is going to do RM is just remove right but this is gonna remove everything in a folder so all subfolders all files everything so only use this if you're really sure that you want everything to be gone alright this stuff does not go in the recycle bin this is gone like forever gone so having said that I know that I'm okay with my node modules being gone I've done this you know plenty of times so our node modules and when we when I run this everything's going to be gone and our node modules folder is gonna be gone so let's go CD right I can't I can't even get to that that that doesn't exist okay our node module so now we're gonna run yarn and know we're still getting the same errors okay so I guess I didn't fix it it's in Korea dependency hmm I don't really know what the issue is maybe if I updated all of our packages it might work I'm a hesitant to do that right now because but sometimes when you upgrade packages they break something if they're breaking changes within the packages so I'd rather not do that at the end of the day the end of a workday hum but let's just doublecheck everything still works it should work so let's refresh alright great still works see all right let's go back to the live chat oh cool dragon hunter says actually that grid is neat so a good job yeah definitely good job harsh it really like that okay rook said I just got an email from Codecademy that they teach grid now on their CSS court course doing that later get course first awesome yeah that that's the CSS grid is really good for a lot of things this is probably one of the very few use cases that I would want to go with something else just for this in particular CSS is it's good it's great it's always getting better but there's still no easy way to do something like this with CSS and be able to have as much control over layout as you could you know we're doing this with JavaScript okay John Hanson says grid so CSS grid has grid Auto flow row column row dense column dense which gives very tight fit and you can set min max on the rows and columns cool actually I would love to see an example of some something like this done with CSS grid if it's possible to do something that that truly looks like this if there's a pure CSS way to do it I'm I'm definitely open to it so I'm not aware at least the last time I tried to implement something like this which is normal CSS as far as I could tell with with researching it there was not a way to get this exact layout but maybe maybe something's happened since then with with CSS grid that allows it Blake says my droid is isn't displaying all my categories actually if you like if you're having trouble with with some of your files send me send me a link to your repo let me know what's going on I can take a look at it if you want me to harsh it says so so you now like password this NPM module I I don't have an opinion about it yet because I've only worked with it in terms of just reading the documentation to be able to understand what you did and try to troubleshoot so I don't know that I've used it enough to reasonably have an opinion about it but it's definitely working to do what we wanted to do in terms of the password let's login so I do like the results Harshit says will I get a tshirt this as I have 20 PRS yeah I'm for sure you have you have enough full requests just on this project alone I mean I'm assuming you did sign up for hack tober fest so assuming you signed up you'll definitely get to keep this shirt okay so on Hanson saying so in react to change state on an imported component on click go up the Dom to retrieve a key value then uses that key to array dot fine using the key to locate it and pull in the data I'm not sure I'm not really sure how that works behind the scenes so I'm not I don't know that I could comment enough on the mechanics of what is happening behind the scenes within react okay cool it looks like a few of you are interested in freelancing advice oh cool thanks Harsha I mentioned there's a package manager for PHP but I couldn't remember it was its composer all right that makes sense I am I was thinking it started with like a calm I was thinking compass but I knew it was and I was just thinking that because we used something called compass earlier at least we're going to use it so awesome it's called composer for PHP so for any p8 I know we have some PHP people that watch the stream so if you haven't already used a check out composer as a package manager for PHP oh cool and Zuber mentions that rails have gem so gems the package manager and for dotnet the package manager is nugget awesome thanks for that Zuber I don't know that I've seen you that much in the live chat commenting so I don't know if if you're new here to the chat are you just usually not able to comment in the live chat that frequently but anyway welcome and thanks for contributing okay in ass where do you find customers for freelance projects okay cool I'll answer like I said I think I'm going to do a video and in going more depth into this but I'll definitely answer this about freelancing right now so the questions where do you find customers for freelance projects so I'm just going to speak from my experience and and maybe try to give some advice some more general advice but for me I'll tell you I'll tell you what didn't work so I got I think I got one customer through my website through the contact form on my website only one ever now I'm sure that my website helped because people could go there first and check me out or you know whatever it probably did help but the contact form on my it was not really that useful I did sign up for several different freelancing sites so I think I did just call it freelancer maybe it was called freelancer so I did that one I did she was the other one they still send me messages all the time no I can't remember what it was okay so I basically did one where they send you potential customers and you can bid on the project so basically you have to buy like tokens to be able to bid on it I only got one customer from that and it was a really small customer I don't think I made more than $100 off of working with that customer so that wasn't great the same thing with the freelance website I didn't really have a great experience it seems like you have to to get projects you just have to undercut everybody else in terms of price so low that it's it's basically like working for free it takes a lot of work to get enough reputation on those things so I don't personally recommend that unless you really have nowhere else to go and you just want to get some work for your portfolio then you know go ahead and go to those freelance websites what works for me the most was personal connections and I know when I heard this when I was starting out freelancing I always I didn't want to hear that right because I want to just be able to sit at my computer and code and get customers but that's not really how it how it works freelancing is about selling yourself just as much as it's about coding so you have to be willing to talk to people and let them know what you do and you know be able to show them some of your projects basically to talk about how great you are and how great work you have so if you're not comfortable with that I would rethink freelancing or at least think of a different so here's what I did starting out that really helped me I found someone who was willing to do the work to find customers and then they would give me the projects to work on but they needed a gobetween between the customer and between me so I didn't have to handle contracts I didn't have to go to meetings with a customer I rarely had to speak on the phone with customers or email with them this person did all the work now the downside of that is that I made a lot less than I could have if I had done everything but it was nice because I got to focus all my energy on my time on just doing the work doing the coding so I was able to learn a lot more than I otherwise would have if I had to handle everything now through that I was able to build up my portfolio and focus on the coding and then I was able little by little to get some clients so at first maybe it was through family connections I just let my people in my family know you know aunts uncles cousins you know hey I'm working on this and then they would mention it to people that they knew so I got some work from that didn't make a ton of money off of it but I was still trying to build my portfolio I was able to through social media let people know what I was doing so I reached an even bigger audience of people that I still knew in real life and his friends with but then they could bring me connections so I had some of my best clients came from a connection of someone who was a former student of mine when I used to teach high school their boyfriend needed a website and then I did a website for their boyfriend their boyfriend's one of his best friends needed a website for their company saw what I did and then wanted me to work on their websites so I ended up getting into the New York City market through them even though I live far away from from New York City then through them the CEO of that company his his mom and dad runs several other companies in New York and I was able to do websites for them that ended up being one of my best clients I made the most money off of it was very very nice working relationship steady income the biggest client I ever had in terms of money I got because through social media someone who my wife went to college with worked for a company and her father was the CEO of the company found out through my wife that I did websites because she had just asked on social media hey does anybody know anything about websites my wife is able to say yeah got a client from that that was when I did that website and finally finished it and got paid that increased my income by 25% that year just from that one website so basically my point is my best clients came from personal connections sometimes I didn't actually know the people but people I knew knew those people so like I said maybe you might be comfortable this maybe you won't but what you really should be doing if you want to make freelancing work is talking about what you do to the people around you you don't have to be annoying about it you don't have to only talk about that but make sure that everybody on social media knows who you are and what you can do make sure that all your friends and family know what you can do and that's going to be your best clients if you want to advertise otherwise so I did paid ads on on Facebook on Twitter on LinkedIn Google Ads I did all those different ads I did not get customers from those ads was it was a good experience I learned how to use all this products and be able to advise clients on on how to use them search engine optimization it helped to get my website up to you know the first page of Google near the top for my local area but my best clients weren't from the local area anyway so that really wasn't it wasn't a big deal so all those things are good because clients will expect you to have them they'll expect you to have good SEO they'll expect you to have you know a good presence on social media and stuff and if you don't have that they might start to doubt well like does this person really know what they're doing they can't even manage their own website and brand so you have to do those things but don't expect that those things are going to bring you in a ton of clients maybe if you were wellknown enough at some point it would help but at first personal connections are where it's at so I went on for a long time about that sorry but it's really important the other option that you have I mentioned I found someone who is willing to be the gobetween between the clients and I there are services that do that as well if you can't find a personal connection that would want to do that for you so top towel is an organization that you you take a series of tests so that they know that you're a good developer and then they set you up with clients they handle all the contracts with clients they're the ones that pay you directly the clients don't pay you directly so it cuts down on a lot of that stuff that is not always easy to deal with right if you I've had situations where clients didn't pay me when they were supposed to pay me and it can be a mess and it really is stressful when you're counting on income for your family and you know a company is not paying you so that's a tough situation that's another thing I do recommend always always have a contract I I worked without contracts for a long time and I never had problems and I thought it was fine until somebody decided not to pay me and after that I never did work without a contract so you might be able to get lucky for a while I got lucky with it for like two years but then I had a client not pay me and it just it took forever to get paid luckily I did finally get paid but months after I was supposed to receive a payment so anyway I know I just threw a lot at you hopefully I'll have some time to put that in a more organized format in a video at some point but let me know if you have any other questions let me know maybe it'll be good I can write all the questions down and then try to make sure I answer them in my video Blake asks what should I use for wireframing on Windows for free um hmm I'm not sure of Windows what does the thing Adobe came out is it called Adobe XD it was something like that but I don't know if it was free it might have just been free when you they were testing it so I'm not sure I don't have anything that I use for Windows so I don't know of anything but if anyone else knows of anything good and free to do wireframes on Windows please put that in the lab chat now okay John Hanson says I think the big guys like Google are pushing for developers to use local storage dragon on it says go for local storage or local forage module okay cool yeah maybe we'll maybe we'll check into that it's switching it over to local storage Harshit says it would definitely be harder to set that up so we'll check it out maybe we'll see how difficult it will be if it'll be worth it to set it up I'm for this project I'm not worried one way or the other if we're gonna switch it over I would want to do it because if that's the the best practice to do then I think it would be cool to do that on the stream just to show this is how we should do things but otherwise I think cookies will be more than adequate for this use case rohan says the it's quite the irony because most of google services rely heavily on cookies most don't even touch local stores yeah you're right actually that's definitely true rook says Google is weird like that they don't even use angular from what I've heard oh yeah I don't I don't know I usually check with which sites are made out of I haven't done that for a while with Google Sites everyone says using Google API is it's quite common that you can see them say to do the opposite of what they usually say you would usually do really frustrating but that's Google they use angular across many things now okay so dragon hunter says HTTP only cookies are not vulnerable to XSS attacks crosssite scripting attacks but to CSRF attacks so the session could be hijacked okay actually to be honest with you for this project the data is not really sensitive most of the data that ends up in the bulletin is also publicly available through other channels so I'm not that worried about it to be honest with you I never thought that this bulletin should have to be password protected that was a decision made higher up and I fought against it but I lost so I'm not super worried about the security in terms of if somebody really wants to find out you know the what's going on in the bulletin like they're gonna know the dates of when you can go get training on PowerPoint and they're gonna they're going to know what open positions that we have at the University which you can already find out on the main website they're gonna see the chapel's schedule for when they're there are mass times which you can already see on the main web site so there are very few things it I would argue there's pretty much nothing that should that couldn't be public knowledge but anyway I was told that an easy password protected so that's what I'm going to do and I'm gonna provide a reasonable level of security but I'm not going to kind of over engineer this so that we're protected from all everything that could possibly happen if at some point we end up working with more sensitive data then definitely yes I think we should be as safe as we can but I think it potentially could be a waste of a waste of our time to really try to you know make this solid and you know airtight and no one can get in Harshit says I remember some guy named a folder it's the the little Tod icon and and he did RM RF tilde and his whole date it was wiped yeah yeah that you could literally wipe out everything on your hard drive with RM RF so like don't use it unless you for sure know what's going on dragon under says to choose between CSRF and XSS definitely take measures about XSS and forget about CSRF soar local storage all the way okay rook says I heard some guys on the syntax podcast talking about how scary our MRF is they suggest using something called trash it's on brew okay cool oh maybe I'll look into that right now I I rarely use RM RF when I do use it obviously like I I'm very careful about it but if I find myself having to use it more often might not be a bad idea to switch to something a little safer dragon hunter says is there a yarn lock like npm yeah yes there is a yarn lock file and then in a new version of NPM there's the equivalent file ok harsh it's saying basically since I'm using react 16 many packages are not updated that so that's that's probably why I'm getting the warnings okay dragon owner says our MRF node modules works with NPM it seems to not with yarn yeah I mean I guess if you really wanted to get rid of it you should get rid of your yarn lock file too so you could R get rid all the node modules and your yarn lock and then you could reinstall the from that way if you really wanted it to be totally clean slate all Roland says you could also use the force flag to force reinstall of all node packages all right good to know thanks your honor okay I think I think John Hanson is is explaining more is his question earlier about react like moving up to get I don't remember exactly what it was but he's saying vanilla Jas allows easily moving up and down the Dom to create comparison statement is true Falls to render an object I'm not sure if it's smart to do the same in react okay I'm not sure I might need to see a use case to give a decent answer to that so anyway so John if you if you have a use case then maybe I could I could give an opinion on that okay world's us how much would you charge or get for an average project okay I'm going to be I'm going to be completely honest here about what I charge and what I get so I'm not going to name names of clients and they may not want people to know what they what I get paid but I'll try to be vague about that but I'll tell you so when I started out five years ago I started out working getting work from someone else for $10 an hour so which is a little bit crazy right I had two kids at the time and I've didn't pay $10 an hour or working less than full time doing this web work but the deal was basically the guy he knew me personally but he had no proof of my skills he just knew that back in high school I was smart and I was into technology stuff and he knew he could trust me so started me out and would say like hey I'll pay you $10 an hour but what I'll do is you know if you have a project that I need you to work on and you don't know how to do it I'll say you know take two hours I'll pay you for two hours to learn it and then do it right so I was able to learn a lot so I considered it like an internship only a paid internship which it really was kind of like that I learned a lot now what a you did say as well is that every slide on three months or something I'd be up for a race so I ended up making more than that quickly now along the way I moved up certainly whenever I got my own clients I would charge more I got to the point where one of my last projects that I worked on I ended up I did a react site that pooled data in from the WordPress API very similar to what we did on one of that we worked on it was actually it was almost identical in terms of the structure of the project as project one which was the catechetical Institute website and this project I did and I believe I made eleven thousand seven hundred dollars something like that somewhere around so like around twelve hundred dollars or twelve thousand dollars for that website so there was a whole range of stepping up what I would charge people and then it did sometimes depend on who I was doing the work for a nonprofit occasionally I would do work for free for a nonprofit if I really wanted to Baal volunteer or I would at least I would give a discount sometimes if you know someone that was family or friend wanted something give him a discount but in general when you're freelancing it's always best to charge more than you think it's really worth because you have to consider more than just the project at hand because there's going to be over it so there's going to be meetings with the client phone calls you know Skype you know video conferencing there's going to be work on you getting a contract made and discussing that getting that sign you're gonna have to spend time sending bills making sure your client actually sends the bills so reminding them about that potentially even having disputes over billing there's going to be all this extra stuff then you have to worry about doing your taxes there's all this other stuff that's involved that you need to account for in the price so you're always going to end up charging more as a freelancer then you'd be willing to accept as a salary if you are on somebody's payroll and then don't forget about insurance as well health insurance you know sometimes your employer would cover that but now you are your own employer so always factoring more at this point in my with my work I would probably depends on the project potentially if it was some project I was really passionate about maybe I would I would do it for less but I wouldn't even consider doing work for anyone right now for less than $100 an hour if I was going hourly if we're talking a flat rate I mean I don't know that it would be worth my time to work on anything for less than like $5,000 I just wouldn't want to I just wouldn't want to deal with the whole process of building trust with a client and contracts and billing and all that in taxes unless I was making a decent chunk of money like I said it depends on the project if something I really wanted to work on then I would probably be willing to do less if something happened and I really needed money I'd probably be willing to do less but that's where I'm at right now I have income coming in that I'm able to pay my bills so I'm in a different position if I was at a point where I really needed to build up my portfolio I'd probably be willing to work for Less also it depends on where you're at if I lived in San Francisco I would I would never work for that little I would work one even more money because the cost of living is so much more I happen to live in the part of the United States where the cost of living is pretty low the area I live is economically depressed so I can I can charge less people in big cities would obviously want to charge more and then depending on what country you're from I it depends I don't know what you know the economies could be entirely different so anyway I could you know keep that in mind especially if your area like my area is economically depressed try to build up your client base outside that area for me I ended up building a client base in New York City I actually also had a client that she was based in Hawaii but she traveled quite a bit so I don't know how often she actually lived in Hawaii but those clients ended up being the most profitable because they for their market my prices seem like really good prayer for them for me I'd make from them more than anybody else was willing to pay in my local area so it was a great deal for both of us you know they were getting a better deal than they could get in their area and so was I so those kind of seek out those kind of deals and then you know you and the client can both be really happy about about what you're making hopefully that helped the original question was how much you charge or get for an average product project so that was probably way more than you wanted from that question but I hope it it helped you out at least some Blake as our vem and Emax considered code editors slash IDs I think the minimax would fall under the code editor category I don't think they're considered IDs I don't use them though I mean I've tried out vim but I don't actively use them so I don't know maybe for some I know there are some people who watch a stream that do use them so please correct me if I'm wrong about that okay harsh it's asking a question about a specific piece of code so let me let me get this on the screen okay let me pull this over here all right so let's check this code out so Harsha's question is okay so she's a verified label I have set up GPG keys what do you think about this actually I've never used these before so let me see okay cool so I I mean I think that's cool that's fine to do what's the what's the main benefit of the GPG key well okay so earlier I mentioned Adobe XD I didn't I didn't know what the status of that was so it seems like the beta version is is still free so if I guess if you can get ahold of the beta version then then you could use it John Hanson says true Jesse talking about what you do and know is a great selling strategy I've had offers to build sites I've had to turn down as I've got my job beside some websites or beyond my skills yeah actually that that reminds me is well if even if you know other developers and get to talk to them they may send you projects like I know I've had people ask me about doing websites for them and I've just been too busy at the time and so I've passed those projects along to other developers that I know and sometimes it works out really well for those developers so if you get to know other developers and let them know that you're you're open annoying work if they trust you and they've seen what you can do and they know it's good work then they probably will have no problem sending people to you so that's that's another good way to find work heart should ask if I've installed compass not yet it finished downloading I didn't saw at the but Harsha says you should see the database structure there ok cool off to check it out let's see if this bulletin was a real project how much would you have charged okay let me think about this the bulletin so the bulletin site is basically a blog site right it's a blog site it's set up WordPress if two different servers to set up probably not going to run load balancing it's not that important that it needs it I set up the SSL now the complicated thing I guess is the login but we may even have more to login then we currently have depending on on what happens with the IT department here let's see we have custom stuff done on the WordPress end so there is going to be custom post types who are already running the graph QL plugin so it's a significant project I mean this this would be this project I'm thinking right now obviously is depending on the organization and and fact there's you know such as my time and things like that but I'm thinking this website would probably end up being you know more closer to like a ten thousand dollar site so our baby set that as a minimum of 10,000 dollar site I mean that's just kind of off the top of my head if I was really gonna price this out I would I would sit down and so like you know I do with my Trello boards and I break things down if I was really gonna give an estimate I would break all the work down like that estimate how long I take everything factoring in the obviously delays that normally happen and the other stuff that you need to do on a project so but a very loose estimate would probably be I probably wouldn't do it for less than than 10,000 so that would I mean and that also includes like you know I'm doing this for clients so there would be rigorous testing there would be training involved I would probably do training videos and some inperson training for whoever is going to be you know inputting the data so it's not necessarily just the development I would include that in the cost as well but anyway that's what I would charge now but they said it does really make a difference there are times when if I'm really busy and someone wants me to do a website I I'll quote them something more than I normally would because my time is more scarce therefore it's more valuable to me so to make it worth my while to work on that project which basically means for me is I'm not gonna see my family while I'm doing that work right so so for me it's I guess there's two there's two sides to the pricing is how much value can you bring to the client which is important because that's what they care about but then there's also how much do you value your own time which is also important because that's what you care about so you need to think about both things and as long as what you value your time to be corresponds roughly to what they think the value you're gonna bring to them through your website is going to be then everybody's happy right so you just gotta meet up you have to find clients that kind of match up with with that so I mean obviously when you're thinking about how much you're gonna charge like you do think about your own experience and your skills as well but because that will help you to convince people that you're worth that much anyway hopefully that helps I don't know how much would you all charge where you're from your area and your skill set what do you think so if anybody has any estimates I know it's really hard to make estimates right on the spot but if anybody has estimates about what it would be like in your area of the world in terms of price let me know I'm really interested to hear that okay so the GPG code just actually verifies that that's really the person that says it is okay cool that's what I figured I just kind of want to know if there was some other reason so yeah I like that that's cool dragon owner said you should do some podcasting you sound like an authority figure I don't know about that I don't actually have any authority I guess my if I have authority it would only be if if people value what I say that would be the only authority that I that I would have but I have experience though so for whatever that's worth like I can definitely give that michail says hey Jesse watching project 2 day 2 now and saw that you went live not really have a chance to watch online but thanks make good work keep it up Oh awesome thanks for stopping and in saying that I really appreciate that and hopefully you can join us live at some point and let me know what you think or any questions that you have we're suggestions but anyway yeah thanks again Blake says $10,000 as well Harshit says you know $10,000 is a year income in India I didn't know that but that's that's cool to know world says it used graph q oh and react yeah I mean think about I think that's an important point to remember a world sang use graph QL and reacts like a client might not necessarily know what graph QL and react is or even care but as a developer like we know the value in that that reacting graph QL are really the technologies that are I don't want to say emerging because Reax been around for a while and graph heels been around for a while but in terms of like very widespread adoption you know the vast majority of the internet is still jQuery territory right I mean as much as developers you know kind of want to stay away from it realistically it's used on a huge portion of the internet right so some of these newer technologies that aren't really new to us because we're developers but in the grand scheme of things in terms of how much they're really used on the internet they they are pretty new they're pretty cutting edge so the value of being able to use those technologies I think warrants a higher price tag now you may have trouble convincing the average person the average client of why this is important for their site how will this will help their site to be better right so while for a project like this maybe it would be hard to find a client who's willing to see the value in this and want to pay that much so but if I were to do a site that had everything that we're doing using all the technology that we're using I would want to charge at least $10,000 so there's definitely that do I think I could find a client locally that would pay ten thousand no not in my local area could I find one somewhere else definitely I've no doubt about it I've I personally have have known I know what companies have paid for websites I've worked on those websites as a subcontractor I know so I I know enough to know that there are a lot of companies out there government organizations and institutions that are willing to pay an obscene amount of money for products that aren't even really that good so if you're starting out $10,000 seems like a lot especially if you're dealing with like local small businesses but when you get to another level of client which should be the goal he really want to make money when you get up there to the larger organizations ten thousand dollars is nothing to them you know you're they're dealing with budgets of millions of dollars so if they're gonna they're gonna drop a hundred thousand dollars on a website and budget that out and saying okay we're gonna do a website every three or four years we're gonna get an update a hundred thousand for this you know so it you know it breaks down to you know maybe 20,000 a year 25,000 a year and they're gonna think that's not really a big deal right that doesn't even cover our electric bills you know they're they're gonna think in terms of I'm gonna spend twenty five thousand dollars a year on a website I buy one truck for my company and it's probably gonna cost me $20,000 $25,000 right and they're mine like you got to put it to them like that right the website is the public face of a business how much do people spend on building a building for their business and making it look nice millions right I'm have homes that are in the millions of dollars so a business to build their actual physical business will think nothing about spending millions on it their website they're going to be able to reach more people so put in terms like that of how important it is ten thousand dollars is nothing I can come out with ten thousand dollars to some companies and they would laugh at me and say no because they're thinking the work that this guy's doing must be terrible if he thinks he can only get ten thousand dollars off of this right so when you when you're thinking about things like that don't get discouraged try to think in terms of what what are the budgets for these companies you know now if you're dealing with a really small business that has three employees and stuff yeah don't walk her in and say I'm gonna build your website and it's gonna cost ten thousand dollars they're gonna say you got to be kidding me like my rent every month is less than a thousand dollars I'm not going to pay you ten thousand dollars for a website because potentially that could be around here where I live that's really it's reasonable as some people have really low rents for their buildings so because the area is so depressed and other areas the United States that's kind of ridiculous but anyway just try to think like I mean I guess I'm trying to like give you a little pep talk at least to keep your mind open to the reality of what businesses spend and how they're thinking and what they are already paying for products so don't sell yourself short just because something might seem easy right to us building this there have been some there's been some trouble right there's been some hard things right that grid layout that masonry layout was a pain for Harshit to put in and the the author the whole authorization login system was really impressive and that took some time but really for us this seems like oh no big deal we do this every day but there's not a whole lot of people in the world that can this kind of thing and and do it professionally and be trustworthy and have it work and be able to handle a lot of people that there's value in that especially yeah big businesses see value in that so don't sell yourself short anyway I keep going off on these big tangents I need to just make this freelancing video and and then direct you all to that or my live streams are gonna end up being three hours long every day okay okay so for this same project rollin is saying in India if he were to try to sell the same project he would charge about three thousand five hundred US dollars equivalent now in India Rowland says there really isn't much demand for webpages or services here in India small businesses will go for the cheapest bidder and large companies have their own team or will contract with the whole team John Hanson says great advice awesome thanks for that yeah I mean hopefully the worst the client can say if you come out with a really outrageous offer that's our offer that seems outrageous to them you know a quote for a price the worst they can do is say no but you know so what they say no maybe you don't really want to work for a company that doesn't value what you do enough to pay you would what the work is really worth so so you just don't be afraid it's a bad path to go down to constantly be apprehensive about what a client's gonna think is reasonable and try to always undercut yourself because you go down that path and where does it stop you end up doing quality work for less money than you should and then you get the type of client who doesn't value your work so even though you know you're giving them a great deal they don't understand that and that's not really the type of client you want to be involved with I've been there I've been involved with that type of client you're giving them a great deal and and they're trying and then at the end of the day what they do is they try to you know if if you're saving them a thousand dollars off of what they would pay they're still gonna try to squeeze out you know an extra hundred dollars off you in the end and said well I'm not paying for this because something's off with it right that's what that's what ends up happening so just go for good quality clients that are willing to pay with something's worth and you'll be much happier if you have to take the the cheaper stuff to build your portfolio up there's nothing wrong with that if you have to take some of that stuff to pay the bills and take care of your family there's nothing wrong with that I've been there and I've done that but when you get to a point where you're comfortable enough with your finances that you can afford to take some risks go for the bigger clients and then once you get there and get those clients in your portfolio it'll be a lot easier uh okay let's see Blake says thanks did you see the link for the repo I did not see the link for the repo did you paste them in live chat I missed it if you could paste it again that'd be great I could try to go back through and look for it but it'll be more of a sure thing if you could paste it again Oh Harshit says yes you tried doing UI for emails tomorrow if you really want me to do you eyes for email I will do that but for those of you that have worked on UI for emails you understand where I'm coming from I'm sure if you haven't you'll see it's not it's not the easiest thing but I'll do it if that's what if this what you all want to see okay cool thanks Blake I got the URL now all right haha world says companies aren't apprehensive in selling you a smartphone for a thousand dollars yeah you're absolutely right I mean think about think about what companies expect you all to pay for their services and then you know maybe it'll make it easier for you to to charge them more all right so a Blake Blake let me know what in particular you want me to check out on this on this repo and I'll try to check it out and you can you don't have to tell me now if you want to make an issue on the repo then we could like we could talk about it you know in the comments of that issue if you want however you want to do it okay well I'm to the end of the live chat now I think we had a great chat we probably spent more time talking than we did with coding but today I feel like is the first time in a while that we accomplished everything that we wanted to accomplish actually a little bit more I didn't even expect to do the masonry layout and get that all merged in so we actually accomplished even more I know I ended up talking a lot so sorry if it was too much but I hope I helped some of you out and sharing my experiences with with freelancing but this dream has been really long and I'm actually like really hot and sweating right now because it's all in my office I didn't want to turn the fan on and mess up the audio so I've got to get a drink and get out of this office my wife just called me too so I'm gonna see what she needs and I'll be back tomorrow thank you so much for all your help Harshit especially thank you in Sebastian for your pool requests you all have been great and I mean Harshit I knew you're talking about freelancing stuff and you're still a student and you're young so that makes it hard but you have skills you definitely have skills so you just need the right connections and I think you'll be fine and in terms of doing work right now though when you're young this is a great opportunity to study and work on those side projects that you really really want to if you need the money I totally understand if you got to take some projects but otherwise I wouldn't worry about freelancing so much right now I would worry I would try to take advantage of this time in your life to work on things that you really want to work on because once you start working for clients you don't have the same amount of freedom like you could now so but anyway I think you have a lot of talent and I think so many of you in the live chat and the watch the shows have so much talent I'm always impressed with with which you all show me so anyway thank you and I will be back tomorrow so until then have a great day
