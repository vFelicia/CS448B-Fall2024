00:00 - hey what's up my name is matt woods and
00:02 - i'm going to talk a little bit today
00:04 - about how i landed my dream software job
00:06 - in about 12 months you see
00:10 - i'm relatively new to development and
00:12 - all this kind of stuff and but i've
00:14 - always loved computers i've always kind
00:16 - of nerded out over technology and was
00:18 - big into video games and always was kind
00:20 - of the go-to tech person with computers
00:23 - and everything but it wasn't until
00:25 - uh like a couple years ago that i really
00:27 - bear down and got serious about software
00:29 - got involved in like a coding boot camp
00:31 - and like really started to run with it
00:33 - and learn javascript and learn some php
00:34 - and different things um and it
00:36 - eventually uh getting involved in the
00:38 - community all these crazy things and so
00:39 - i'm gonna i'm gonna talk a little bit
00:40 - about um basically my journey um from
00:44 - about a year ago when i went to my first
00:46 - software development conference with
00:48 - thunderplanes and how the people i met
00:50 - there and the habits i built along the
00:52 - way helped me actually get a full-time
00:54 - job there we're actually the ship code
00:56 - to production where i work on an awesome
00:58 - marketing team and get to use the best
01:00 - parts of marketing that i love and in
01:02 - development and get to bring those two
01:04 - skills together and uh some skills that
01:07 - like whether you're you're more on the
01:08 - technical side or whether you want to
01:10 - work in a software business just some
01:11 - stuff that anyone can pick up and use
01:13 - but it's mainly going to focus on kind
01:14 - of the development side of that
01:16 - um
01:17 - and so
01:18 - i remember uh
01:20 - man when i started this journey
01:23 - you know
01:24 - like 12 18 months ago
01:26 - i had never really touched javascript
01:28 - before i was always someone who had like
01:30 - poked around with html and css it kind
01:32 - of stayed in my lane uh and kind of done
01:34 - some fun and stuff i'd like messed
01:35 - around with like bootstraps and some
01:37 - styling things uh like made some quick
01:39 - tweaks on websites maybe messed around
01:41 - with some wordpress themes but i never
01:43 - really like dug and built something from
01:45 - the ground up or built something that i
01:46 - can say like uh that was original that
01:48 - i'd made it i had an idea in my head and
01:51 - i wrote some code and i made it work um
01:53 - and then i i think back and compare that
01:55 - to the past
01:56 - a few weeks and things i've been working
01:58 - on where i've actually gotten to to pair
02:00 - on real like code that's going to go
02:02 - production with like uh the co-founder
02:04 - of the startup that i'm working at that
02:05 - has you know 28 people in oklahoma city
02:08 - and new york and we have you know
02:11 - thousands and thousands of people that
02:13 - use our app
02:14 - we're tackling real code and i'm getting
02:16 - to actually see work that i do go out
02:18 - into the real world and be seen by more
02:20 - people than i ever thought possible
02:21 - which totally just blows my mind and i
02:23 - couldn't know that the things that i was
02:25 - i'd hope that the things i was learning
02:26 - would be that applicable but it's a
02:28 - whole different thing to actually see it
02:30 - in action
02:31 - um
02:31 - some other crazy things that have
02:33 - happened recently is just being able to
02:34 - build my network and meet other people
02:36 - in software and be able to like really
02:38 - advance my career by leaps and bounds to
02:40 - the point where like uh i wanted to
02:43 - get to know other people in this area
02:45 - that i'm looking to grow in this growth
02:46 - professional area where you're kind of
02:48 - combining engineering and marketing and
02:50 - the best parts of both and so i decided
02:52 - to go on kind of this connection spree
02:54 - and reach out to a bunch of people who
02:55 - knew this better than i did so i reached
02:57 - out to people from facebook and spotify
02:59 - and airbnb and pinterest and google and
03:02 - all like the companies that i could the
03:03 - best companies i could think of that
03:04 - actually have these growth teams that
03:06 - combined engineering and marketing and i
03:08 - was able to connect with 25 really
03:10 - qualified people in less than 24 hours
03:13 - because of the connections i've been
03:14 - able to make um
03:16 - habitually with some of the stuff i'm
03:17 - going to talk about in a little bit uh
03:20 - and that's been a huge game changer for
03:21 - my career and just
03:23 - even going beyond oklahoma city with
03:24 - some of the connections i've been able
03:26 - to make
03:26 - as well as just like getting involved
03:28 - with events and different uh being able
03:30 - to share my work out in public and it's
03:32 - open doors to meet founders ceos and
03:34 - excellent engineers and marketers from
03:37 - all kinds of awesome companies uh in
03:39 - oklahoma city but also uh in boston and
03:42 - san francisco and other places and i've
03:43 - actually gotten to meet some of them
03:45 - face to face and that's been a total uh
03:46 - game-changing experience um
03:49 - and i've made lots of valuable
03:51 - connections that i treasure this day and
03:53 - i'm hoping it's just the beginning um so
03:56 - i'm going to talk about how that
03:57 - happened too
03:58 - but really if i had to like narrow down
04:01 - uh the three things that i want to talk
04:03 - about these three key habits that kind
04:04 - of opened the door to me being able to
04:06 - step into my dream job and software uh
04:09 - i'd say that there were these three
04:11 - things i'm going to go more in depth on
04:12 - each of these the first habit
04:14 - is becoming an automatic learning
04:16 - machine and i'm going to talk about what
04:18 - that means and kind of how you can build
04:20 - that up yourself
04:22 - the second thing is building a three
04:24 - circle network and i'll explain what
04:26 - those three circles are and why each of
04:28 - them matter and you have to do them in
04:29 - sequence and then the last step is
04:32 - sharing your byproducts
04:34 - basically as you're learning the stuff
04:35 - how you can put it on the world to not
04:37 - only help other people but to help
04:39 - yourself
04:40 - get the job and the and the do the work
04:43 - that you want to do and live the life
04:44 - you want to live uh because that's why
04:46 - we're doing this stuff
04:48 - so uh anyways i'll have to say hi my
04:50 - name is matt uh i'm a marketer and
04:52 - developer at tailwind right now
04:55 - you can check me out on twitter at
04:57 - matafur tweet me with any questions or
04:58 - follow-up stuff you have after this
05:00 - uh or you can check out my website at
05:02 - mattwoods.io
05:04 - and we are always hiring at tailwind so
05:05 - if you're interested
05:07 - in kickstarting your development
05:09 - career or making a change always let me
05:12 - know
05:13 - happy to chat about that too but i want
05:15 - to dive into this first
05:16 - habit this becoming an automatic
05:19 - learning machine i think more than
05:21 - anything this is the thing that enabled
05:23 - me to make the jump from what i was
05:25 - doing before which is like working at a
05:27 - marketing agency and hop into
05:29 - a a software startup at tailwind where
05:33 - i'm actually shipping code and doing
05:34 - these things and so i was at the
05:36 - marketing agency when i was like
05:39 - starting to kind of
05:40 - jump into this coding journey but i
05:42 - wasn't really sure where to start and i
05:43 - think like a lot of people i i kind of
05:45 - had this feeling i was talking to
05:47 - a buddy
05:48 - uh earlier this week who's just getting
05:51 - started in coding and one of his number
05:53 - one questions was basically why am i
05:55 - feeling so apprehensive towards getting
05:57 - involved in new projects and getting
06:00 - started in coding um and it's a really
06:03 - good question and i think it's one that
06:05 - pretty much everyone feels when they're
06:06 - getting started uh and my answer is like
06:09 - you know to fight that apprehension that
06:11 - everyone feels that you need to give
06:12 - yourself
06:13 - more
06:14 - wins you need things that you're going
06:15 - to feel good about that you can like
06:17 - plant a flag in the ground and say hey i
06:19 - built this i did this i feel good about
06:21 - this coding is exciting it's not easy
06:24 - but i did it and i want to do more of it
06:26 - so how do you get those wins well it
06:28 - doesn't just happen it doesn't just fall
06:30 - on your lap this stuff is hard but the
06:32 - way that you get better to get those
06:34 - wins is you have to ship
06:37 - more and when i say ship you know it's
06:39 - not like you know carnival cruise lines
06:41 - type of thing we're talking about um
06:43 - taking a piece of code a project
06:46 - something and putting it out in the
06:48 - world to where it's you know it may not
06:50 - be quote unquote finished and perfect
06:52 - but it is done and you are getting it
06:53 - out in front of real people real users
06:56 - real uh getting real feedback in the
06:58 - real world
06:59 - um
07:00 - i saw this tweet the other day by one of
07:02 - my buddies ezra
07:03 - who also started kind of learning to
07:05 - code around the same time that i did and
07:07 - i thought it was really insightful what
07:09 - he said was the biggest challenge i feel
07:12 - as a new or fresh developer is always
07:14 - comparing myself to other developers and
07:16 - i always get stuck wondering how they
07:17 - got there versus just learning how to
07:19 - work on stuff myself and just talk about
07:20 - this discipline of like putting your
07:22 - head down and building
07:24 - code is just something we all have to
07:26 - learn we all have to get better at
07:28 - because it's the only way that you get
07:31 - better
07:32 - i think one of the mistakes when when
07:34 - you get started with this habit of
07:35 - learning to code too is that you wanna
07:38 - you wanna start really big you wanna
07:39 - make the full app with like the the
07:41 - billing and the cool feature and this
07:42 - crazy marketing side it looks slick and
07:44 - it like gives slack a run for their
07:46 - money but i think actually the best way
07:49 - to go around this is
07:51 - to start small and consistent i read
07:54 - this book about how
07:56 - to basically create a habit of learning
07:58 - that really transformed the way i think
08:01 - about this and i i still reference it to
08:03 - this day it's called the one thing by
08:04 - gary keller and he the way he talks
08:06 - about it is like if you want the best
08:08 - chance to succeed at anything you want
08:10 - your approach should always be the same
08:12 - you have to go small because if you go
08:13 - too big uh you're not going to build up
08:16 - this feedback loop of getting a you know
08:18 - doing something hard but rewarding
08:20 - getting the win
08:22 - learning from it doing something a
08:23 - little bigger getting the win right if
08:25 - you if you start too big you're never
08:26 - going to get that feedback you're never
08:28 - going to get that win and you're not
08:29 - going to stay with it and so many people
08:31 - drop off and i came close at times like
08:33 - it can be really discouraging when
08:34 - you're getting started but sticking it
08:36 - out can make such a big difference
08:38 - um i think really
08:41 - building this coding habit
08:42 - to comes down to
08:44 - these two things healthy inputs
08:46 - and healthy output just like you know
08:49 - any any good system is going to
08:50 - understand its inputs and outputs you
08:52 - are a system when you're learning to
08:53 - code and you have to understand what
08:55 - you're putting into your learning
08:56 - environment to succeed and what's what
08:59 - what you're out putting into the world
09:01 - to make it an ultimate success and so in
09:04 - terms of input what are you putting in
09:06 - uh so this can look different for
09:08 - different people uh but some examples
09:10 - are like tutorials of like following
09:12 - different classes these are more
09:13 - accessible than they've ever been online
09:15 - uh you can join classes which is one of
09:17 - the things i did
09:19 - you can listen to podcast things like
09:21 - syntax and full stack radio and
09:22 - different uh great podcast by developers
09:25 - that can supplement things in uh in your
09:27 - learning journey you can go to events
09:30 - these can be virtual events these can be
09:31 - real events i recommend both uh even
09:34 - checking out blog posts basically
09:35 - there's anywhere you can get information
09:36 - that will put new ideas that will show
09:38 - you how to do things that will reinforce
09:40 - things you already know you need to be
09:42 - putting the right things in
09:44 - to fuel your learning engine
09:46 - but then
09:47 - one of the most common traps that i've
09:49 - definitely felt myself starting to slip
09:50 - towards at times is you can get in kind
09:52 - of this like um
09:54 - it's kind of like groundhog day but with
09:56 - tutorials where you're just watching
09:58 - someone else build something and then
09:59 - you're parroting them and just like
10:01 - typing out the same stuff and then
10:03 - you're not doing anything yourself
10:04 - you're not actually internalizing any of
10:06 - it you're just copying a bunch of
10:07 - tutorials you're reading a bunch of blog
10:09 - posts but you're not actually you're not
10:10 - actually producing anything if someone
10:12 - asked you to sit down and code even a
10:15 - simple to-do app you would freeze or you
10:17 - get stuck or you'd have to go find
10:19 - someone else's finished work which isn't
10:20 - what you want you want to be able to
10:22 - understand and internalize the
10:23 - fundamentals enough to do great work
10:25 - yourself and so
10:26 - you need outputs right you need to
10:28 - create a forcing function
10:31 - uh for yourself to ship and when i say
10:33 - forcing function
10:35 - this is something
10:36 - that is like an external pressure or
10:38 - something that that
10:40 - helps motivate you to actually get
10:42 - something done it can be
10:44 - like a mentor who holds you accountable
10:45 - it can be a small group it can be
10:48 - like a deadline that you give yourself
10:50 - to make sure that you actually follow
10:52 - through otherwise when things get hard
10:54 - you'll just stop you'll put it aside
10:56 - you'll think maybe i'll get to this
10:58 - later i'll learn this the right way to
11:00 - do something later uh but the reality is
11:02 - you don't always get there and then
11:04 - you're stuck so we don't want uh that
11:07 - situation either
11:08 - so this can look different for for every
11:10 - person it will look different for every
11:11 - person but for me um some of the inputs
11:14 - that really helped me uh first one was
11:17 - uh okay coders if and this is a
11:19 - phenomenal program if you're in the
11:21 - oklahoma city area okay coders is is
11:23 - like a
11:25 - a boot camp kind of so it starts out at
11:26 - like html and css and goes into
11:28 - javascript and you have some projects
11:30 - that you work towards at the end and you
11:31 - work with the team
11:33 - and you're taught by real developers in
11:34 - the community and so it was great just
11:36 - for me as kind of like it was actually a
11:38 - little bit of both i got to
11:40 - learn some of the fundamentals i got to
11:43 - practice them and i was motivated and
11:45 - excited enough from that input of being
11:47 - in that class a couple times a week to
11:49 - go on home and practice every single
11:51 - night and reinforce that learning habit
11:53 - which makes a huge difference i can't
11:55 - tell you how many of my teammates were
11:57 - so excited um
11:59 - but they just didn't do the practice at
12:01 - home and so some of it just didn't stick
12:03 - which is so frustrating uh because i
12:06 - know like before
12:07 - the last couple years i started and
12:09 - stopped a few times because it just
12:11 - hadn't stuck
12:12 - so it's super easy to slip into but if
12:14 - you can get excited enough and then have
12:16 - that forcing function of hey we got this
12:17 - big project hey i get out gotta show
12:20 - this this new thing i'm working on at
12:22 - next week's class it'll force you to
12:24 - ship it'll force you to get stuff done
12:26 - and that can be invaluable
12:28 - tutorials can be great i learn really
12:30 - well by like watching videos and then
12:33 - putting it aside and like doing it on my
12:34 - own and that's my learning style but
12:36 - it's going to be different for every
12:38 - person so figure out what works well for
12:39 - you if it works to like go through and
12:41 - just read the documentation and just
12:43 - freestyle it great awesome um if videos
12:46 - work well for you too cool do that but
12:48 - just
12:49 - experiment with a few and figure out
12:51 - what works for you uh as an input
12:54 - podcast can be great i just enjoy
12:56 - podcast anyways and so i'm going to
12:57 - listen to them and
12:59 - they might as well be helping me learn
13:01 - different things get exposed to new
13:02 - ideas um
13:04 - and so it it's just one of those things
13:06 - that doesn't really hurt it's not going
13:08 - to like teach me how to write uh a good
13:10 - function or uh or like organize my code
13:13 - well but it'll expose me to new ideas
13:15 - and keep me excited and motivated which
13:17 - in itself is really valuable
13:19 - and then events i'm going to talk more
13:20 - about events in a little bit but super
13:21 - valuable and there's a lot of stuff that
13:23 - goes along with events that you really
13:25 - can't get anywhere else in my opinion
13:27 - and so i highly highly recommend local
13:30 - and and online events
13:33 - in communities if you're able to get
13:34 - involved with that
13:36 - as far as output the two things that
13:37 - really made a big difference for me is
13:39 - number one uh like mentors
13:41 - i'll talk a little bit about this in a
13:43 - little bit but having mentors who are
13:46 - at the next step ahead of you who have
13:47 - actually done this stuff and can give
13:49 - you feedback and give you some tough
13:50 - love can help you ship stuff is super
13:53 - valuable when you're learning to
13:54 - actually ship this stuff and get it out
13:56 - the door
13:57 - as well as like actual work projects
13:59 - when i was able to take some of the
14:01 - advanced like css stuff i was learning
14:04 - implement little bits of javascript like
14:06 - even at my last job before i joined
14:08 - tailwind getting able to put that to
14:11 - work on projects that the the company
14:12 - was getting paid for was super valuable
14:15 - and so um
14:17 - that the sooner you can get to that and
14:19 - actually work it into your day-to-day
14:20 - work uh the better the sooner you can
14:23 - actually create projects that people use
14:25 - or use yourself that is a huge win so
14:28 - whenever possible i highly recommend
14:31 - aiming for that
14:33 - all right
14:34 - other things uh that help with shipping
14:36 - i'm focusing a lot on shipping um
14:40 - because this is like really the
14:41 - transformational thing that will
14:43 - separate you from like a hey i want to
14:45 - do code
14:46 - i want to be a programmer
14:48 - but just kind of that want to be wishful
14:50 - thinking stage to actually doing it
14:52 - actually achieving it actually being
14:54 - ready for the job or the opportunity
14:55 - when it comes along because reality is
14:57 - like the opportunity can come along but
14:59 - the right opportunity
15:01 - if you're not ready for it will like
15:02 - totally crush you or totally disappoint
15:04 - you because you're not ready for it you
15:05 - haven't put in the hard work of actually
15:07 - i'm actually doing this stuff
15:09 - but if you have it's gonna feel so good
15:12 - um and it's actually easier if you keep
15:14 - doing smaller projects all along the way
15:16 - rather than just trying to cram it in or
15:18 - like just force feed yourself
15:20 - documentation or something like that so
15:22 - some of the stuff that i actually
15:23 - shipped that got me ready for the stuff
15:25 - i do today
15:26 - uh all kinds of stuff but um some of the
15:28 - more original stuff is like i built like
15:30 - a habit tracking app in okay coders
15:32 - which was fun we did like we used like
15:34 - phonegap and cordova
15:36 - um like basically built this like
15:38 - website that would load on your phone
15:39 - and like you could load it in ios and
15:41 - android and that was like super fun and
15:44 - we built this app called like 21 that
15:45 - would help you build a habit over 21
15:47 - days it's super exciting
15:48 - another one that we did actually for
15:51 - tailwind before i joined as kind of like
15:53 - an okay coders project was like this
15:54 - search tool where we took in a bunch of
15:56 - data and we were able to to organize it
15:59 - by categories and make these different
16:00 - pages um for like these certain types
16:02 - like pinterest pins then we could search
16:04 - through it and only return certain pins
16:07 - based on the search query to the user
16:09 - and we used react for that and so is a
16:11 - great way to like
16:12 - cut our teeth on javascript and actually
16:14 - build something that was like really
16:15 - useful um and as an example of the kind
16:17 - of thing that we like might actually
16:19 - build someday tailwind and so that was
16:21 - really exciting there were also some
16:22 - things i did that just kind of scratched
16:24 - my own itch i decided that i wanted to
16:26 - learn to build an api so i just did it
16:28 - um i met with my mentor he gave me some
16:31 - some tips
16:32 - on how to actually do this stuff and i
16:34 - would build some of it show him the code
16:36 - he would show me how to make it better
16:38 - show me the next thing to do okay great
16:39 - you wrote the you wrote it let's write
16:41 - some tests for it let's actually add on
16:43 - to it let's uh create something to seed
16:45 - some data into it and work with the file
16:47 - system doing all these things so i
16:48 - learned a lot on that project i was also
16:51 - just doing these like quick uh projects
16:54 - of like creating a blog or redoing my
16:56 - personal website or making like a random
16:58 - quote generator um and so just these
17:00 - quick and easy like front uh kind of
17:03 - front end stuff
17:04 - that were fun that were interactive that
17:06 - keep you motivated and uh
17:09 - are not that bad to create once you get
17:11 - in the habit of it
17:14 - some other ways to get ideas for things
17:15 - that you can be shipping so you can just
17:17 - ship more because really the more you
17:19 - ship the more you'll come up with ideas
17:21 - the more you'll understand what to learn
17:23 - like this really is like the linchpin
17:25 - habit that helps you that helps make
17:27 - everything after it easier to the 20 you
17:29 - can focus on that'll make the other 80
17:31 - that people normally worry about when
17:33 - they're learning to code
17:34 - so much easier trust me i wish i'd done
17:36 - this more when i was getting started but
17:38 - a few ideas that that i highly recommend
17:41 - uh to my friends when they're learning
17:43 - to code uh one is like pair with someone
17:45 - who actually shipped so if you know a
17:47 - developer if you know someone who
17:49 - actually works on this kind of stuff who
17:50 - is shipping code regularly uh and it's
17:53 - being used by people or or who always
17:55 - comes up with great side project ideas
17:57 - just like get with them and say hey can
17:59 - i just watch you code or hey can we work
18:01 - on this small part of this idea i have
18:02 - together or hey can we grab copy and
18:05 - like walk through this thing i mean
18:06 - actually the faster you can get into
18:08 - real code the better i think i've
18:09 - learned more from actually pairing over
18:11 - real code uh with like the developers i
18:14 - work with than than any other than any
18:17 - other thing that i've done it is
18:18 - insanely productive um if you can it can
18:22 - be kind of scary because you know you're
18:23 - you're like oh i'm gonna have to look
18:24 - stuff up in real time or
18:26 - what if i make a mistake with this
18:28 - person is no way more than me i'll feel
18:30 - really dumb but it's really just
18:32 - something you have to get over because
18:33 - the learning is worth it um
18:35 - it's so worth it
18:37 - another thing that you can do that i i
18:39 - like to try is sort of copying on easy
18:41 - mode so what i mean by this is uh there
18:44 - are tons of apps out there that you
18:46 - probably use every day you know
18:48 - like slack like your to-do list like
18:51 - like yet another email tool um that you
18:54 - know people use these you know people
18:56 - need these
18:57 - um and so
18:58 - it's not really a question of like if
19:00 - this is a good idea or not it's just a
19:01 - question of um
19:03 - can you build this or not like the the
19:06 - mailchimp or slack or like these these
19:08 - super popular apps everyone knows that
19:09 - they want them or even like uber uh what
19:12 - if you could take that app and just make
19:13 - a super simple easy version of that
19:16 - super simplified down or maybe you focus
19:18 - on the design you just break up a small
19:20 - piece what if you just made like a
19:22 - really simplistic version of mailchimp
19:24 - what if you just made a like a clone of
19:27 - uber's like home page what if you just
19:30 - you know you can pull some of these
19:32 - ideas and it can make it sort of easy
19:34 - for you to get started because you're
19:35 - just copying someone else's idea and and
19:38 - putting your own spin on it
19:40 - they're actually holding
19:41 - whole tutorial sites that just focus on
19:43 - sort of this thing of making an easy
19:45 - clone so it's a really fun way uh to do
19:47 - this and it can feel good too because
19:49 - you feel like oh i understand why this
19:52 - company did it this way it's really
19:53 - motivating
19:54 - another thing that i really like is this
19:56 - airbnb 10 to 1 exercise so
19:59 - this is an exercise that airbnb is one
20:02 - of their founders kind of goes through
20:04 - when he's thinking of like a new
20:05 - experience or product to create so he
20:08 - will think of like okay if i'm
20:10 - trying to create like a vacation for
20:12 - someone what is the absolute
20:14 - best vacation they could create like on
20:16 - a 10 out of 10 scale like what is the or
20:18 - like i think he actually goes from one
20:20 - to ten so he'll be like what's the worst
20:21 - experience okay you go to like your
20:22 - airbnb and and nobody's there right and
20:25 - you just leave and you're super
20:26 - frustrated you want your money back okay
20:28 - what's like a good experience like a
20:29 - five out of ten okay they go in there
20:31 - they show your room it's fine it's clean
20:33 - it's a reasonable price good location
20:35 - cool awesome what about like uh like a
20:37 - nine or ten out of ten though there's
20:39 - like a parade when you get in they know
20:41 - your favorite candy
20:43 - like everyone welcomes you in it's like
20:44 - the beatles like rolling into town
20:47 - uh like you get exclusive reservations
20:50 - the finest restaurant kind of the
20:51 - ultimate experience
20:53 - you can do this and then like he will
20:54 - take the like the ultimate one with this
20:56 - crazy
20:57 - like over-the-top uh like experience and
21:00 - he'll pair it down step by step until he
21:02 - gets to something that's between like
21:04 - terrible or very achievable and like
21:06 - exceptional and that's like what he
21:07 - builds um you can do the same thing with
21:09 - your app so if you think like okay i'm
21:10 - gonna make
21:11 - uh you know a
21:14 - um
21:14 - you know a recipe app what is the
21:16 - ultimate recipe app okay it like reads
21:18 - my mind and it like understands like all
21:20 - my dietary habits and what grocery
21:22 - stores are closest to me when it's
21:24 - building my list and it just it
21:25 - integrates with here you can think of
21:27 - all these crazy features you could have
21:29 - and you can strip those away one by one
21:31 - by one and bring it down a level bring
21:33 - it down a level and that can somewhere
21:35 - in there you may find a really unique
21:36 - approach you wouldn't normally think of
21:38 - um
21:40 - that you can still actually build or
21:42 - build a copy of that or build a mock of
21:44 - that or build something and that can be
21:45 - a creative way to get a cool idea that
21:48 - you might not normally think of
21:50 - some other places that you can find
21:52 - great quoting exercises to ship more
21:54 - stuff are our free code camp they have
21:57 - awesome exercises along the way and they
21:58 - also have lots of lessons as i'm sure
22:00 - you guys know if you're checking out
22:01 - this video but if you don't like free
22:02 - code camp projects are awesome that's
22:04 - where i got some ideas like the random
22:06 - quote generator um and there's also if
22:08 - you once you get done you can compare it
22:10 - to other people have done the same
22:11 - project which is also super helpful for
22:13 - javascript 30 by west boss this is one
22:16 - of my absolute favorite courses that i
22:18 - always recommend to people and it's
22:20 - totally free you can go in and he gives
22:22 - you like 30
22:23 - bite-sized sort of project that you can
22:26 - actually ship and make things on over
22:28 - about 30 days and this is insanely cool
22:31 - because it's you don't have to mess
22:33 - around with your development environment
22:34 - or a framework or something crazy it's
22:36 - all vanilla javascript there's some
22:38 - really cool like styling already baked
22:40 - in so you feel good about it and it
22:42 - feels like you're getting some quick
22:43 - wins so highly recommend that course
22:46 - um as like a quick one to get off the
22:48 - ground after you've uh brushed up on
22:49 - some of the basics of javascript
22:53 - the next thing uh
22:55 - it's just like if you were excited about
22:56 - learning something cool if you're
22:57 - excited about learning react or react
22:59 - native if you just really want to
23:01 - understand how databases work and how to
23:04 - work with them
23:05 - come up with an idea that just helps you
23:07 - learn that thing
23:08 - right come up with an idea that works
23:10 - really cool that works really well with
23:12 - react and you're excited about maybe
23:14 - it's totally
23:15 - useless or silly or whatever who cares
23:17 - like just make it
23:18 - and just focus on learning that
23:20 - technology and that's a great way to
23:21 - build your skill set
23:23 - and then the last one one of my favorite
23:25 - ones in the world is like just get paid
23:26 - to actually make things just get paid um
23:29 - i've gotten paid uh
23:31 - to do like freelance projects just web
23:33 - design and baking a little bit of
23:35 - javascript or try out some new css
23:36 - things or whenever i get to to put these
23:39 - things to practice uh at work um
23:42 - it's even better because i you know i'm
23:44 - spending
23:45 - maybe a few days of like you know my
23:48 - nine to five or
23:49 - squeezing a little time on a weekend and
23:51 - like i get recognition for it at work or
23:52 - i can get work resources or i get a
23:55 - chunk of my day that i get to focus on
23:57 - that so and this is especially good if
23:59 - you uh are like really busy or it's hard
24:02 - for you to carve out time on nights and
24:04 - weekends at home
24:06 - sometimes that happens sometimes you
24:07 - have kids sometimes you have a crazy
24:08 - schedule
24:09 - but if you can
24:11 - find a way like work with your boss work
24:13 - with the people um at your company to to
24:17 - get paid to actually learn this stuff
24:19 - and and make something that's valuable
24:21 - for the company to use uh or the client
24:23 - to use do that every time the sooner you
24:25 - can get to that even if it's just you
24:27 - know html and css even if it's just a
24:29 - little bit of simple javascript um
24:32 - that's a huge win
24:34 - because you're getting paid you're
24:35 - growing your skills and then you can
24:37 - level up and start doing more stuff
24:39 - making your own stuff getting paid more
24:41 - to do cool stuff for the same company
24:43 - you never know what opportunities that
24:45 - could unlock but it's been super
24:46 - powerful for me
24:48 - and then uh what to actually learn so
24:50 - yeah i've been focusing more on like on
24:52 - all this obviously on how you learn and
24:55 - the habits you build to learn
24:57 - because i really do believe that's more
24:59 - important than like a specific tech
25:00 - stack
25:01 - once you understand the fundamentals
25:03 - once you learn understand how to do this
25:05 - stuff once it's habitual and automatic
25:07 - and you don't even think about it
25:08 - switching from ruby to php or from
25:11 - javascript to
25:12 - you know whatever the next great thing
25:14 - is isn't going to be such a big deal
25:16 - but that being said it does kind of help
25:18 - to understand the lay of the land and so
25:21 - uh there's this great uh sort of like
25:23 - web developer
25:24 - road map flowchart that's super helpful
25:27 - at least when i was getting started to
25:28 - understand
25:30 - what's out there kind of where am i out
25:32 - of my journey on the front end of the
25:33 - back end and what things can i keep an
25:35 - eye out for or learn about um so that's
25:38 - super helpful highly recommend that you
25:40 - check it out i'm not going gonna walk
25:41 - you through it now
25:42 - but definitely an excellent excellent
25:44 - resource if you haven't checked it out
25:46 - before
25:48 - all right
25:49 - the second habit that i think is super
25:51 - crucial um when you're
25:54 - if you're gonna get your dream job in
25:55 - software uh is i recommend building a
25:58 - three-circle
25:59 - network so what i mean by that is
26:01 - normally when people think about
26:02 - networking they jump straight to like
26:04 - terrible networking events with like
26:06 - platters of food and people are like
26:08 - throwing their business cards at you and
26:09 - just like it's kind of like a i don't
26:11 - know this whole like sleazy used car
26:13 - salesman schtick and
26:16 - you just feel like people are talking at
26:17 - each other but not really connecting
26:19 - yeah nobody wants that um but what i
26:22 - think
26:23 - good networking is
26:25 - is just helping people and being part of
26:27 - the community and giving back and this
26:30 - starts with what i call like your inner
26:32 - circle so i think of it in like these
26:33 - three terms
26:34 - your inner circle uh your professional
26:36 - network
26:37 - and what i call the crowd
26:40 - and so we're going to start with the
26:41 - inner circle what is the inner circle
26:43 - your inner circle when you're starting
26:44 - out networking is like your mentors your
26:47 - peers and the people that you are
26:49 - helping immediately it's like a small
26:51 - core group of people these are people
26:53 - that you can like learn from and lean on
26:55 - for like these 10x big growth decisions
26:58 - uh or trajectory that you're on and like
27:00 - these tough decisions that you're making
27:01 - these are people that can help keep you
27:03 - accountable for your side projects that
27:04 - can help you get introductions for your
27:06 - first job that can
27:08 - um basically you can turn to for honest
27:11 - and helpful and real feedback
27:13 - um
27:14 - got this idea kind of from like a like a
27:16 - five-star general i think i heard about
27:18 - uh and his
27:20 - habit at all times was to have three
27:23 - people in his life one who was a step
27:25 - ahead of him in his career for someone
27:27 - who had done the things that he wants to
27:29 - do
27:30 - who has experience who was wiser older
27:33 - and had value to pass down to him that
27:36 - he didn't know to ask for or and he can
27:39 - turn to that person when when he needs
27:40 - advice when he needs help
27:42 - also someone you respect that is like at
27:45 - your level but it's like best in class
27:47 - it is doing good work that can can keep
27:50 - like kind of light a fire onto you and
27:52 - keep you moving forward and show you
27:54 - what's possible at your level and you
27:56 - can get honest and real feedback that
27:58 - maybe isn't
27:59 - it doesn't make sense to get from a
28:00 - mentor and then of course like you've if
28:04 - you once you get your the next step that
28:07 - you want to take once you get that job
28:08 - that opportunity you get to ship that
28:10 - project it's i really think you have an
28:12 - obligation or an opportunity to turn
28:15 - around and help other people who were
28:17 - who were in your shoes a few months ago
28:18 - or a few years ago and so always being
28:21 - willing to help lend a hand to people
28:23 - and and pass that on pay that forward is
28:26 - i think so critically important and and
28:29 - i think everyone should take the chance
28:30 - to do that
28:32 - uh then there's also your professional
28:34 - network i think this is what most people
28:35 - think of when they think of networking
28:37 - um i tend to think of this just in terms
28:40 - of like who can i ask a favor from with
28:42 - a quick message
28:44 - this is i like people
28:46 - uh from like professional groups people
28:48 - from teclahoma
28:49 - probably or like free code camp would
28:51 - often fall into this i think uh
28:54 - another really critical thing to
28:57 - define in this stage is like a super
28:59 - connector so if you know there's like i
29:01 - have this friend when i was in college
29:03 - named maggie i and whenever we were
29:05 - working on a group project where we had
29:06 - to go like
29:07 - uh we're working on a project we had to
29:09 - go like interview
29:10 - professors or go find other students who
29:12 - knew
29:13 - uh who had specialties with different
29:14 - things i just asked her hey who do you
29:15 - know and she just send me over like a
29:17 - list of like all these people to get in
29:18 - touch with like immediately oh i know
29:20 - brad over here oh i know this professor
29:22 - over here oh i can call them a favor
29:23 - over here they just know all these
29:25 - people you want to know people like that
29:28 - in your industry and be building those
29:30 - connections so that when
29:32 - uh you know if something horrible
29:34 - happens and you lose your job like great
29:35 - you can reach out to that person they
29:36 - can connect you to the right people it's
29:39 - like hey i really need help with the
29:40 - side project i need help with this
29:41 - volunteer thing i'm doing who
29:44 - i don't know who to ask for who do you
29:45 - know you want those people who are super
29:48 - deeply connected especially if that's
29:51 - not your thing you want to know those
29:52 - people it's so helpful classmates family
29:54 - friends relatives former co-workers you
29:57 - know the point here is like you know
29:58 - more people than you think you do
30:00 - a lot of times you tend to discount oh i
30:03 - don't know any people in software oh i
30:05 - don't know any people with the kinds of
30:06 - jobs i want to have but you have friends
30:09 - you have family you have relatives and
30:11 - they might know people like that so feel
30:13 - free to like reach out and and connect
30:15 - with those people and look for the
30:16 - second and third degree connections who
30:18 - can get you in the door who can connect
30:20 - you with a super connector who can show
30:22 - you a professional group that you didn't
30:23 - know about
30:24 - um
30:25 - this is super key to positioning
30:27 - yourself to be able to get that job in 6
30:30 - 9 12 24 months whatever that is
30:34 - and then the crowd this is like who can
30:36 - i meaningfully help today i'm going to
30:38 - talk in a little bit about like sharing
30:40 - your byproducts and sharing what you're
30:41 - learning but the point is this is like
30:43 - social media email subscribers people
30:45 - who visit your website or blog or watch
30:47 - your videos or
30:48 - uh listen to your podcast whatever that
30:50 - thing is but um i i believe that once
30:52 - you like have your mentors and your
30:55 - peers and that close
30:57 - knit inner circle in place
30:59 - and once you have a professional network
31:01 - of of people that you can connect with
31:04 - and and be a part of that you should
31:06 - be like putting stuff out in the world
31:08 - like in your space so if you're like
31:10 - really into react like awesome uh how
31:13 - can you go help the react community how
31:16 - can you build a following how can you
31:18 - you know whether that's on twitter
31:19 - that's on youtube videos or whether
31:20 - that's teaching other people how to do
31:22 - something in your framework like
31:24 - find ways that you can help other people
31:27 - because that is going to come back
31:29 - around when you need it most especially
31:31 - when it comes to to landing a job
31:34 - and a lot of times it's it's hard to see
31:36 - what that'll look like but
31:38 - i've it's pretty
31:40 - people who build that habit of helping
31:42 - people and building a crowd and building
31:43 - an audience
31:45 - it usually comes back around in a good
31:47 - way to help them out
31:49 - and it's a huge advantage
31:52 - uh and this has just like totally
31:55 - been a key factor in like my journey
31:57 - like there's no way i'd be diving as
31:59 - deeply into marketing or software
32:01 - development if it weren't for like this
32:02 - huge crowd of passionate talented people
32:04 - who have like introduced me to new tech
32:07 - uh got me
32:08 - like involved in communities and got me
32:10 - excited about it uh like introduce new
32:13 - strategies uh for projects and code and
32:16 - doing exciting things uh giving me
32:18 - feedback and like blog posts and
32:20 - podcasts and courses and
32:22 - side project ideas and everything uh and
32:24 - like we talked about like actually
32:26 - keeping me accountable the ship work
32:28 - whether it's you know just like
32:30 - a blog post or a video or like putting
32:32 - together an api or whatever it is like
32:34 - having people around you at each of
32:36 - those levels the inner circle your
32:38 - professional network the crowd is going
32:40 - to be
32:40 - a huge help
32:43 - to actually getting stuff done
32:46 - um
32:47 - and there are like lots of other things
32:49 - that i learned
32:51 - in this sort of like networking journey
32:53 - but
32:54 - i think one of the main ones that that's
32:56 - helpful for everyone is just that don't
32:58 - get discouraged when people don't get
33:00 - back to you right away with your
33:02 - follow-up
33:03 - endless follow-up needs to be your new
33:06 - default i think so many times when i was
33:09 - reaching out um about jobs and when i'd
33:12 - meet a great connection for someone i
33:14 - wanted to to learn from uh sometimes
33:17 - they they wouldn't give back to me right
33:18 - away and
33:19 - it was so easy for me at first to
33:21 - attribute that to like oh they don't
33:23 - like me they don't think i'm any good or
33:25 - maybe they're they're just like hostile
33:27 - towards me but usually it's just
33:29 - busyness people are so crazy busy and i
33:32 - know i'm busy so many times uh and and
33:34 - so sometimes i won't get back to people
33:36 - as quickly as i should but it's
33:38 - you know
33:39 - that person might think i'm i'm mad at
33:41 - them but i'm not i'm not i'm just like
33:42 - super busy and if they keep following up
33:44 - i want to help them i want to connect
33:46 - with them i want to get to know them i'm
33:48 - so just
33:48 - making endless follow-up your new
33:50 - default is so critical
33:52 - um to making that happen
33:55 - i got encouraged by this story one time
33:57 - by this the ceo who once followed up
33:59 - with an investor
34:01 - 48 times in a row without a response and
34:03 - then on you know 47 times he you know
34:06 - he'd reach out every few days every few
34:07 - weeks whatever and and he would leave an
34:10 - email leave a message and just didn't
34:11 - get back to him on the 48th time that
34:14 - investor got back to him and said oh
34:16 - sorry i've just had a lot of fires
34:17 - burning i've been super busy uh can you
34:19 - meet tomorrow morning
34:20 - and they met and he invested in his
34:21 - company
34:22 - a lot of times
34:24 - you know people who you want to work
34:26 - with or who are doing great stuff
34:29 - are just super busy and so the more you
34:31 - can
34:33 - do follow up well have that endless
34:35 - follow-up that continual follow-up go
34:37 - the distance with that um to help them
34:39 - out um a lot of times as long as you're
34:41 - not doing that in an obnoxious way as
34:43 - long as you're doing that from a good
34:44 - place
34:45 - um
34:46 - and you're doing it and like doing the
34:48 - hard work
34:50 - of having something to show having
34:51 - something to bring to that meeting um
34:54 - making that worthwhile for both of you
34:56 - um that can actually be a great great
34:57 - experience for everyone involved
35:00 - um and so like this is like a general
35:02 - fault that i scheduled that i've used
35:04 - before um for jobs or getting coffee or
35:06 - just like finding mentors or things like
35:08 - that i'm just like reaching out and then
35:11 - making sure that i follow up like after
35:13 - two days after four days after a week
35:14 - after a few weeks and on and on and on
35:17 - to make sure that i don't let that slip
35:18 - through the cracks and that if uh
35:20 - something doesn't work out it's not
35:22 - because i was too lazy or forgetful um
35:26 - to do them the courtesy of like actually
35:28 - following through
35:31 - all right
35:32 - last habit number three sharing your
35:35 - byproducts this is a super key idea i
35:38 - believe and the reason
35:40 - why why does it matter of like sharing
35:41 - your byproducts and also what does this
35:43 - mean
35:44 - um
35:46 - let me share what this means first so
35:49 - if you're following all the stuff i've
35:50 - talked about you're connecting with
35:52 - people you're you're learning building
35:54 - first you're becoming a learning machine
35:56 - by creating these quick wins by
35:58 - creating the right inputs and the right
36:00 - forcing functions to force you to put
36:01 - stuff out in the world you're going to
36:03 - be learning cool stuff you'll be like
36:05 - you know messing around in javascript
36:06 - you'll be building websites you'll be
36:08 - creating apps you have these great side
36:09 - project ideas you'll you'll learn new
36:11 - things
36:12 - so you'll be creating stuff
36:14 - um and it's tempting to just just let
36:17 - that out and just let that sit you know
36:19 - i shift that thing great awesome move on
36:20 - to the next thing
36:21 - but what i believe you should do and i
36:23 - learned this from like uh this this
36:25 - article from the basecamp folks who are
36:27 - who makes this awesome app um and they
36:29 - put a lot of great blog posts out into
36:31 - the world but about like selling your
36:32 - byproducts
36:34 - um and about like if you are learning
36:36 - these things in real time if you are you
36:38 - the byproduct of that is like hey you
36:39 - have like a cool learning that went
36:40 - along with it
36:42 - uh as you were learning this as you were
36:45 - navigating it as you were encountering
36:47 - new problems and finding new ways to
36:48 - solve it other people would benefit from
36:50 - that if they just knew
36:52 - what you knew if you just documented the
36:54 - things that you learned the things you
36:55 - worked on and put it out in the world in
36:56 - a blog post and a video and a social
36:58 - media post anyway
37:00 - um even a lightning talk and a real
37:02 - person event speaking um that would help
37:04 - someone else
37:05 - and so often people feel like they need
37:08 - to to be a guru right to have it all
37:10 - together to have it figured out so they
37:12 - like put on their creator cap and they
37:14 - feel like they have to be some social
37:16 - media influencer or have to have done
37:17 - this for 30 years and know everything
37:19 - inside and out and write the book on it
37:21 - but that's actually not true you can
37:23 - help people by just documenting your
37:24 - honest experience of what you've been
37:27 - learning and just share that in a quick
37:29 - lightning talk share that in a quick
37:30 - social media post and a tweet another
37:32 - quick screencast and that can help
37:34 - people that is the byproduct of the hard
37:37 - work and the learning that you've
37:38 - already been doing so why not
37:41 - so the reason why
37:43 - sharing your byproduct is so impactful
37:46 - is because it helps others first off
37:48 - um
37:49 - which is so fulfilling and you've been
37:52 - helped by other people's you get to help
37:53 - them too that feels really good it is
37:55 - worthwhile to deal just for that but
37:57 - beyond that when you help other people
37:59 - you end up helping yourself too
38:01 - when you when you help people out in
38:03 - your community they're going to want to
38:04 - help you out too
38:05 - if you help them learn anything they
38:06 - want to hook you up with a new job
38:08 - they'll want to help you on your side
38:09 - project they'll want to help you fix
38:11 - that bug
38:12 - send people your way when you're hiring
38:14 - whatever that is you want to always be
38:16 - helping um
38:17 - and giving back to the community and
38:19 - then it just creates opportunities by
38:22 - showing your work putting it out on
38:24 - github
38:25 - sharing the process of why you built
38:27 - something a certain way that shows
38:28 - people how you think and people will be
38:30 - attracted to that people notice that
38:32 - stuff and then
38:33 - people who some people who might have
38:35 - overlooked you before realize wow okay
38:36 - this person actually knows what they're
38:38 - doing i really want to work with them i
38:40 - really want to hear them speak i really
38:42 - want to to hop on a side project with
38:45 - them or invite them in you never know
38:46 - what's going to happen
38:48 - but people can't discover the cool stuff
38:50 - you're doing if you don't tell them
38:51 - about it it's simple but it's so easy to
38:54 - overlook
38:56 - some practical
38:57 - um
38:58 - ways that this has looked for me
39:00 - uh it's just like whenever i get a
39:02 - chance to
39:03 - public speak i always say yes
39:06 - i it's so
39:07 - it was really like intimidating to jump
39:09 - into it first before i started public
39:11 - speaking it was my number one fear
39:13 - but once i hopped in once i muscled
39:15 - through it like it has been so rewarding
39:17 - and even though it's been scary
39:19 - um i've never regretted saying yes to a
39:22 - public speaking opportunity
39:24 - last year at teclahoma
39:26 - thunderplanes
39:28 - at this conference um
39:30 - i had never done a lightning talk before
39:31 - which is a line attack is like a five
39:33 - minute
39:34 - presentation in front of people kind of
39:36 - impromptu
39:38 - on just one simple idea that you want to
39:39 - share
39:40 - so i gave one on like how to market your
39:42 - side project and how to find great ideas
39:45 - and i gave that talk and one of the
39:47 - people in the audience was a developer
39:49 - at tailwind and so afterwards like he
39:50 - came up to me and said like hey man
39:51 - great talk
39:53 - um and we got to talking about his
39:55 - lightning talk about react and he
39:57 - introduced me to his co-worker
39:59 - and we all chatted uh and then they just
40:02 - introduced me to the ceo of tailwind
40:04 - that went really well
40:06 - and they got me connected with the
40:07 - director of marketing and that got the
40:10 - whole interview process started and i
40:11 - eventually ended up hopping on board
40:13 - their team
40:14 - so it's
40:16 - if you actually connect the dots like me
40:18 - stepping out and giving a lightning talk
40:20 - actually opened the door to me
40:22 - getting like my dream job at a tech
40:24 - startup in oklahoma city um it's kind of
40:27 - crazy to think about like if i would
40:28 - have like sat down and had been too
40:30 - timid to do that
40:32 - that might not have happened or it might
40:33 - not have happened as fast which is is
40:35 - crazy um so
40:37 - again when when it came up my second
40:39 - year thunder planes of course i did a
40:40 - lightning talk and i didn't you never
40:42 - feel as ready as you want to you don't
40:44 - you never feel like those butterflies
40:45 - are like that it gets totally easy or
40:47 - not scary but it's always worth it and i
40:49 - always recommend
40:51 - doing that
40:52 - the other thing when it comes to
40:53 - documenting this stuff is just like keep
40:55 - it simple pick one primary channel and
40:58 - just stick to it if you love being on
40:59 - video just do videos um if you're on
41:01 - instagram all the time give it a shot
41:03 - just do a quick instagram post when
41:04 - you're coding and share what you're
41:06 - working on if you like writing stuff out
41:08 - in blog posts cool awesome that's great
41:10 - uh write a blog post after you finish
41:13 - like learning something or shipping some
41:14 - code
41:15 - do you have some friends and you just
41:17 - like talking about the latest and
41:19 - greatest like
41:20 - uh things in
41:21 - you know python that you're working on
41:23 - cool awesome sort of python podcast and
41:25 - and just document this stuff every week
41:27 - and just have a fun time doing it
41:30 - if you pick that one thing and you stick
41:32 - to it it gets way easier to build a
41:34 - crowd because you're talking about what
41:35 - you already know you have this forcing
41:37 - function of hey i'm going to make a blog
41:39 - post every week i'm going to put a
41:40 - podcast out every week it can be so so
41:43 - helpful
41:46 - another thing that i found is really
41:47 - helpful when you're figuring out well
41:48 - like what can i really talk about i feel
41:50 - like i'm rehashing the same stuff that
41:52 - everyone is talking about we don't need
41:54 - another you know
41:57 - uh to-do list tutorial in javascript
41:59 - okay fine like i get that too like you
42:01 - want stuff that's going to stand out and
42:03 - it's something that only you can create
42:06 - um
42:06 - so
42:08 - at first i say just go back to row one
42:10 - you know always be shipping but beyond
42:11 - that once you get in the habit to or if
42:13 - you need something a little bit
42:14 - different i find this trick of like
42:16 - you're finding your superpower really
42:18 - helpful
42:19 - so this is an idea from like scott adams
42:21 - the creator of bilbert and his his idea
42:24 - is basically that you can could take two
42:26 - skills so for me like i
42:29 - started growing my marketing skills like
42:31 - early on and so i feel really confident
42:34 - that
42:34 - uh like
42:36 - that skills and then i also started like
42:38 - learning the code and software
42:39 - development and building apps and great
42:41 - okay cool so if i take the overlap
42:43 - between those two contrasting
42:45 - specialties that i have those two skills
42:47 - uh i have like marketing and development
42:49 - and so i can combine those and be like a
42:50 - marketing developer and find things okay
42:52 - cool marketing apis and okay cool how
42:55 - can we build a bot that
42:57 - helps people on your homepage and does
42:58 - these cool marketing things cool how can
43:00 - i automate my emails in this cool way
43:02 - that's like a cool marketing thing and
43:04 - you can find things that most developers
43:06 - aren't talking about and most marketers
43:07 - don't know how to do and that can be
43:09 - super valuable
43:10 - so yours will look different than this
43:12 - but you can find uh other things
43:15 - that are in addition to software
43:16 - development and layer them on top and
43:18 - that overlap is what you can talk about
43:20 - that's unique to you and really valuable
43:22 - and showcases uh what you're passionate
43:24 - about and what you're good at which can
43:25 - be make it a lot easier to get started
43:27 - just documenting this stuff
43:29 - another great thing about sharing your
43:31 - byproducts is it makes it so much easier
43:33 - to come up with ideas for things to
43:34 - actually make which goes back to one of
43:36 - the other problems and barriers that you
43:39 - you run into when you're trying to get
43:40 - started creating
43:42 - um
43:43 - and so i found it really helpful if
43:45 - you're putting stuff out in the world it
43:46 - becomes and you have people that are
43:47 - paying attention on twitter on your
43:49 - email list or at meetups it gets easier
43:51 - to like tap your community for these
43:54 - insights as you're ongoing so you can
43:56 - discover pain points right if you're
43:58 - like really involved in the javascript
43:59 - community and you have javascript
44:00 - friends and you're talking about this
44:02 - you can maybe discover a need for like a
44:04 - new package that you could write or a
44:05 - new open source thing you could start
44:07 - if you have an idea
44:09 - if you're starting a following uh for
44:12 - uh like marketers and you're coding
44:14 - things for them uh you can put out a
44:16 - quick tweet and be like hey would it be
44:17 - helpful if i coded this kind of things
44:18 - and you can validate ideas quickly and
44:20 - get feedback from the stuff you're
44:21 - working on uh which can be really really
44:24 - helpful it can help you validate ideas
44:26 - really quickly
44:27 - this is something that i've actually
44:28 - done as well um it's just like i had an
44:31 - idea for a site app that i wanted to
44:33 - work on
44:34 - to
44:34 - uh just like brush up on some coding
44:36 - skills like and so i was like okay what
44:38 - if i can make an app that'll help people
44:40 - meet up for coffee and like sink their
44:41 - calendars and find a free time for both
44:43 - of them
44:44 - so i just put up a quick thing on
44:46 - linkedin because i'm pretty active on
44:47 - linkedin and i get like 41 likes and 18
44:49 - comments i got like a list of i followed
44:52 - up with each and every one of those
44:53 - people one-on-one you can see even some
44:55 - of these people i don't know these
44:56 - people they're second-degree connections
44:59 - and so i was still able to connect with
45:01 - them
45:02 - grab their emails and follow up with
45:04 - them and i didn't actually end up
45:06 - getting as far with that app as i wanted
45:07 - yet
45:08 - um
45:09 - but when i have something to show on my
45:10 - next side project i'm going to plan on
45:12 - like repeating this process and like
45:14 - reaching out making a list and reaching
45:16 - out to people and that way i can i can
45:18 - develop it faster come up with more
45:19 - ideas avoid that block and get more of
45:21 - those quick ones and always be shipping
45:23 - um so and this just came from like
45:25 - documenting the the stuff i was going to
45:27 - work on i didn't i wasn't even planning
45:29 - to post about this side project that i
45:31 - was working on i was like oh it's small
45:32 - it's silly who really cares but more
45:34 - people cared than i thought and so
45:37 - giving this a chance just documenting it
45:40 - and putting it out there in the world uh
45:42 - was a huge advantage and i'm super glad
45:44 - that i did
45:45 - so
45:46 - those are really like the three ideas um
45:49 - in a nutshell that took me from like not
45:52 - really knowing
45:53 - how to code or feeling like i want to be
45:55 - a lot of ways who started to stop so
45:57 - many times to actually getting my foot
45:59 - in the door
46:00 - meeting the right people having the
46:02 - skills built up
46:04 - and and sharing what i was doing to
46:05 - where like i was able to to join this
46:07 - awesome job at tillwind
46:09 - and i love going to work every day i
46:11 - work with some of the best people on the
46:12 - planet and and i'm so happy
46:15 - that i get to do it it's exciting it's
46:17 - fresh it's fun and like i i'm even more
46:19 - excited for like my side projects
46:21 - because the things i'm learning at work
46:23 - like feed into the things i'm doing
46:24 - outside of work in coding and marketing
46:26 - in in the people that i'm meeting and so
46:29 - and and the things the people i'm
46:30 - meeting outside like feed right back
46:31 - into work and make me more excited and
46:33 - it's such a cool place to be and so i'm
46:35 - so glad i started those habits you know
46:37 - like 12 to 18 months ago of just like
46:40 - putting my learning on autopilot
46:42 - building those those networks and
46:44 - hopping in the oklahoma city community
46:46 - uh starting to document my work these
46:48 - things make such a big difference over
46:49 - the long run and so that's my experience
46:52 - um again uh hit me up on linkedin
46:55 - twitter
46:56 - email me whatever i'm happy to talk more
46:59 - about um these ideas and what they're
47:01 - like
47:02 - yeah cool thanks guys so much for
47:04 - listening appreciate it take care

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up my name is matt woods and i'm going to talk a little bit today about how i landed my dream software job in about 12 months you see i'm relatively new to development and all this kind of stuff and but i've always loved computers i've always kind of nerded out over technology and was big into video games and always was kind of the goto tech person with computers and everything but it wasn't until uh like a couple years ago that i really bear down and got serious about software got involved in like a coding boot camp and like really started to run with it and learn javascript and learn some php and different things um and it eventually uh getting involved in the community all these crazy things and so i'm gonna i'm gonna talk a little bit about um basically my journey um from about a year ago when i went to my first software development conference with thunderplanes and how the people i met there and the habits i built along the way helped me actually get a fulltime job there we're actually the ship code to production where i work on an awesome marketing team and get to use the best parts of marketing that i love and in development and get to bring those two skills together and uh some skills that like whether you're you're more on the technical side or whether you want to work in a software business just some stuff that anyone can pick up and use but it's mainly going to focus on kind of the development side of that um and so i remember uh man when i started this journey you know like 12 18 months ago i had never really touched javascript before i was always someone who had like poked around with html and css it kind of stayed in my lane uh and kind of done some fun and stuff i'd like messed around with like bootstraps and some styling things uh like made some quick tweaks on websites maybe messed around with some wordpress themes but i never really like dug and built something from the ground up or built something that i can say like uh that was original that i'd made it i had an idea in my head and i wrote some code and i made it work um and then i i think back and compare that to the past a few weeks and things i've been working on where i've actually gotten to to pair on real like code that's going to go production with like uh the cofounder of the startup that i'm working at that has you know 28 people in oklahoma city and new york and we have you know thousands and thousands of people that use our app we're tackling real code and i'm getting to actually see work that i do go out into the real world and be seen by more people than i ever thought possible which totally just blows my mind and i couldn't know that the things that i was i'd hope that the things i was learning would be that applicable but it's a whole different thing to actually see it in action um some other crazy things that have happened recently is just being able to build my network and meet other people in software and be able to like really advance my career by leaps and bounds to the point where like uh i wanted to get to know other people in this area that i'm looking to grow in this growth professional area where you're kind of combining engineering and marketing and the best parts of both and so i decided to go on kind of this connection spree and reach out to a bunch of people who knew this better than i did so i reached out to people from facebook and spotify and airbnb and pinterest and google and all like the companies that i could the best companies i could think of that actually have these growth teams that combined engineering and marketing and i was able to connect with 25 really qualified people in less than 24 hours because of the connections i've been able to make um habitually with some of the stuff i'm going to talk about in a little bit uh and that's been a huge game changer for my career and just even going beyond oklahoma city with some of the connections i've been able to make as well as just like getting involved with events and different uh being able to share my work out in public and it's open doors to meet founders ceos and excellent engineers and marketers from all kinds of awesome companies uh in oklahoma city but also uh in boston and san francisco and other places and i've actually gotten to meet some of them face to face and that's been a total uh gamechanging experience um and i've made lots of valuable connections that i treasure this day and i'm hoping it's just the beginning um so i'm going to talk about how that happened too but really if i had to like narrow down uh the three things that i want to talk about these three key habits that kind of opened the door to me being able to step into my dream job and software uh i'd say that there were these three things i'm going to go more in depth on each of these the first habit is becoming an automatic learning machine and i'm going to talk about what that means and kind of how you can build that up yourself the second thing is building a three circle network and i'll explain what those three circles are and why each of them matter and you have to do them in sequence and then the last step is sharing your byproducts basically as you're learning the stuff how you can put it on the world to not only help other people but to help yourself get the job and the and the do the work that you want to do and live the life you want to live uh because that's why we're doing this stuff so uh anyways i'll have to say hi my name is matt uh i'm a marketer and developer at tailwind right now you can check me out on twitter at matafur tweet me with any questions or followup stuff you have after this uh or you can check out my website at mattwoods.io and we are always hiring at tailwind so if you're interested in kickstarting your development career or making a change always let me know happy to chat about that too but i want to dive into this first habit this becoming an automatic learning machine i think more than anything this is the thing that enabled me to make the jump from what i was doing before which is like working at a marketing agency and hop into a a software startup at tailwind where i'm actually shipping code and doing these things and so i was at the marketing agency when i was like starting to kind of jump into this coding journey but i wasn't really sure where to start and i think like a lot of people i i kind of had this feeling i was talking to a buddy uh earlier this week who's just getting started in coding and one of his number one questions was basically why am i feeling so apprehensive towards getting involved in new projects and getting started in coding um and it's a really good question and i think it's one that pretty much everyone feels when they're getting started uh and my answer is like you know to fight that apprehension that everyone feels that you need to give yourself more wins you need things that you're going to feel good about that you can like plant a flag in the ground and say hey i built this i did this i feel good about this coding is exciting it's not easy but i did it and i want to do more of it so how do you get those wins well it doesn't just happen it doesn't just fall on your lap this stuff is hard but the way that you get better to get those wins is you have to ship more and when i say ship you know it's not like you know carnival cruise lines type of thing we're talking about um taking a piece of code a project something and putting it out in the world to where it's you know it may not be quote unquote finished and perfect but it is done and you are getting it out in front of real people real users real uh getting real feedback in the real world um i saw this tweet the other day by one of my buddies ezra who also started kind of learning to code around the same time that i did and i thought it was really insightful what he said was the biggest challenge i feel as a new or fresh developer is always comparing myself to other developers and i always get stuck wondering how they got there versus just learning how to work on stuff myself and just talk about this discipline of like putting your head down and building code is just something we all have to learn we all have to get better at because it's the only way that you get better i think one of the mistakes when when you get started with this habit of learning to code too is that you wanna you wanna start really big you wanna make the full app with like the the billing and the cool feature and this crazy marketing side it looks slick and it like gives slack a run for their money but i think actually the best way to go around this is to start small and consistent i read this book about how to basically create a habit of learning that really transformed the way i think about this and i i still reference it to this day it's called the one thing by gary keller and he the way he talks about it is like if you want the best chance to succeed at anything you want your approach should always be the same you have to go small because if you go too big uh you're not going to build up this feedback loop of getting a you know doing something hard but rewarding getting the win learning from it doing something a little bigger getting the win right if you if you start too big you're never going to get that feedback you're never going to get that win and you're not going to stay with it and so many people drop off and i came close at times like it can be really discouraging when you're getting started but sticking it out can make such a big difference um i think really building this coding habit to comes down to these two things healthy inputs and healthy output just like you know any any good system is going to understand its inputs and outputs you are a system when you're learning to code and you have to understand what you're putting into your learning environment to succeed and what's what what you're out putting into the world to make it an ultimate success and so in terms of input what are you putting in uh so this can look different for different people uh but some examples are like tutorials of like following different classes these are more accessible than they've ever been online uh you can join classes which is one of the things i did you can listen to podcast things like syntax and full stack radio and different uh great podcast by developers that can supplement things in uh in your learning journey you can go to events these can be virtual events these can be real events i recommend both uh even checking out blog posts basically there's anywhere you can get information that will put new ideas that will show you how to do things that will reinforce things you already know you need to be putting the right things in to fuel your learning engine but then one of the most common traps that i've definitely felt myself starting to slip towards at times is you can get in kind of this like um it's kind of like groundhog day but with tutorials where you're just watching someone else build something and then you're parroting them and just like typing out the same stuff and then you're not doing anything yourself you're not actually internalizing any of it you're just copying a bunch of tutorials you're reading a bunch of blog posts but you're not actually you're not actually producing anything if someone asked you to sit down and code even a simple todo app you would freeze or you get stuck or you'd have to go find someone else's finished work which isn't what you want you want to be able to understand and internalize the fundamentals enough to do great work yourself and so you need outputs right you need to create a forcing function uh for yourself to ship and when i say forcing function this is something that is like an external pressure or something that that helps motivate you to actually get something done it can be like a mentor who holds you accountable it can be a small group it can be like a deadline that you give yourself to make sure that you actually follow through otherwise when things get hard you'll just stop you'll put it aside you'll think maybe i'll get to this later i'll learn this the right way to do something later uh but the reality is you don't always get there and then you're stuck so we don't want uh that situation either so this can look different for for every person it will look different for every person but for me um some of the inputs that really helped me uh first one was uh okay coders if and this is a phenomenal program if you're in the oklahoma city area okay coders is is like a a boot camp kind of so it starts out at like html and css and goes into javascript and you have some projects that you work towards at the end and you work with the team and you're taught by real developers in the community and so it was great just for me as kind of like it was actually a little bit of both i got to learn some of the fundamentals i got to practice them and i was motivated and excited enough from that input of being in that class a couple times a week to go on home and practice every single night and reinforce that learning habit which makes a huge difference i can't tell you how many of my teammates were so excited um but they just didn't do the practice at home and so some of it just didn't stick which is so frustrating uh because i know like before the last couple years i started and stopped a few times because it just hadn't stuck so it's super easy to slip into but if you can get excited enough and then have that forcing function of hey we got this big project hey i get out gotta show this this new thing i'm working on at next week's class it'll force you to ship it'll force you to get stuff done and that can be invaluable tutorials can be great i learn really well by like watching videos and then putting it aside and like doing it on my own and that's my learning style but it's going to be different for every person so figure out what works well for you if it works to like go through and just read the documentation and just freestyle it great awesome um if videos work well for you too cool do that but just experiment with a few and figure out what works for you uh as an input podcast can be great i just enjoy podcast anyways and so i'm going to listen to them and they might as well be helping me learn different things get exposed to new ideas um and so it it's just one of those things that doesn't really hurt it's not going to like teach me how to write uh a good function or uh or like organize my code well but it'll expose me to new ideas and keep me excited and motivated which in itself is really valuable and then events i'm going to talk more about events in a little bit but super valuable and there's a lot of stuff that goes along with events that you really can't get anywhere else in my opinion and so i highly highly recommend local and and online events in communities if you're able to get involved with that as far as output the two things that really made a big difference for me is number one uh like mentors i'll talk a little bit about this in a little bit but having mentors who are at the next step ahead of you who have actually done this stuff and can give you feedback and give you some tough love can help you ship stuff is super valuable when you're learning to actually ship this stuff and get it out the door as well as like actual work projects when i was able to take some of the advanced like css stuff i was learning implement little bits of javascript like even at my last job before i joined tailwind getting able to put that to work on projects that the the company was getting paid for was super valuable and so um that the sooner you can get to that and actually work it into your daytoday work uh the better the sooner you can actually create projects that people use or use yourself that is a huge win so whenever possible i highly recommend aiming for that all right other things uh that help with shipping i'm focusing a lot on shipping um because this is like really the transformational thing that will separate you from like a hey i want to do code i want to be a programmer but just kind of that want to be wishful thinking stage to actually doing it actually achieving it actually being ready for the job or the opportunity when it comes along because reality is like the opportunity can come along but the right opportunity if you're not ready for it will like totally crush you or totally disappoint you because you're not ready for it you haven't put in the hard work of actually i'm actually doing this stuff but if you have it's gonna feel so good um and it's actually easier if you keep doing smaller projects all along the way rather than just trying to cram it in or like just force feed yourself documentation or something like that so some of the stuff that i actually shipped that got me ready for the stuff i do today uh all kinds of stuff but um some of the more original stuff is like i built like a habit tracking app in okay coders which was fun we did like we used like phonegap and cordova um like basically built this like website that would load on your phone and like you could load it in ios and android and that was like super fun and we built this app called like 21 that would help you build a habit over 21 days it's super exciting another one that we did actually for tailwind before i joined as kind of like an okay coders project was like this search tool where we took in a bunch of data and we were able to to organize it by categories and make these different pages um for like these certain types like pinterest pins then we could search through it and only return certain pins based on the search query to the user and we used react for that and so is a great way to like cut our teeth on javascript and actually build something that was like really useful um and as an example of the kind of thing that we like might actually build someday tailwind and so that was really exciting there were also some things i did that just kind of scratched my own itch i decided that i wanted to learn to build an api so i just did it um i met with my mentor he gave me some some tips on how to actually do this stuff and i would build some of it show him the code he would show me how to make it better show me the next thing to do okay great you wrote the you wrote it let's write some tests for it let's actually add on to it let's uh create something to seed some data into it and work with the file system doing all these things so i learned a lot on that project i was also just doing these like quick uh projects of like creating a blog or redoing my personal website or making like a random quote generator um and so just these quick and easy like front uh kind of front end stuff that were fun that were interactive that keep you motivated and uh are not that bad to create once you get in the habit of it some other ways to get ideas for things that you can be shipping so you can just ship more because really the more you ship the more you'll come up with ideas the more you'll understand what to learn like this really is like the linchpin habit that helps you that helps make everything after it easier to the 20 you can focus on that'll make the other 80 that people normally worry about when they're learning to code so much easier trust me i wish i'd done this more when i was getting started but a few ideas that that i highly recommend uh to my friends when they're learning to code uh one is like pair with someone who actually shipped so if you know a developer if you know someone who actually works on this kind of stuff who is shipping code regularly uh and it's being used by people or or who always comes up with great side project ideas just like get with them and say hey can i just watch you code or hey can we work on this small part of this idea i have together or hey can we grab copy and like walk through this thing i mean actually the faster you can get into real code the better i think i've learned more from actually pairing over real code uh with like the developers i work with than than any other than any other thing that i've done it is insanely productive um if you can it can be kind of scary because you know you're you're like oh i'm gonna have to look stuff up in real time or what if i make a mistake with this person is no way more than me i'll feel really dumb but it's really just something you have to get over because the learning is worth it um it's so worth it another thing that you can do that i i like to try is sort of copying on easy mode so what i mean by this is uh there are tons of apps out there that you probably use every day you know like slack like your todo list like like yet another email tool um that you know people use these you know people need these um and so it's not really a question of like if this is a good idea or not it's just a question of um can you build this or not like the the mailchimp or slack or like these these super popular apps everyone knows that they want them or even like uber uh what if you could take that app and just make a super simple easy version of that super simplified down or maybe you focus on the design you just break up a small piece what if you just made like a really simplistic version of mailchimp what if you just made a like a clone of uber's like home page what if you just you know you can pull some of these ideas and it can make it sort of easy for you to get started because you're just copying someone else's idea and and putting your own spin on it they're actually holding whole tutorial sites that just focus on sort of this thing of making an easy clone so it's a really fun way uh to do this and it can feel good too because you feel like oh i understand why this company did it this way it's really motivating another thing that i really like is this airbnb 10 to 1 exercise so this is an exercise that airbnb is one of their founders kind of goes through when he's thinking of like a new experience or product to create so he will think of like okay if i'm trying to create like a vacation for someone what is the absolute best vacation they could create like on a 10 out of 10 scale like what is the or like i think he actually goes from one to ten so he'll be like what's the worst experience okay you go to like your airbnb and and nobody's there right and you just leave and you're super frustrated you want your money back okay what's like a good experience like a five out of ten okay they go in there they show your room it's fine it's clean it's a reasonable price good location cool awesome what about like uh like a nine or ten out of ten though there's like a parade when you get in they know your favorite candy like everyone welcomes you in it's like the beatles like rolling into town uh like you get exclusive reservations the finest restaurant kind of the ultimate experience you can do this and then like he will take the like the ultimate one with this crazy like overthetop uh like experience and he'll pair it down step by step until he gets to something that's between like terrible or very achievable and like exceptional and that's like what he builds um you can do the same thing with your app so if you think like okay i'm gonna make uh you know a um you know a recipe app what is the ultimate recipe app okay it like reads my mind and it like understands like all my dietary habits and what grocery stores are closest to me when it's building my list and it just it integrates with here you can think of all these crazy features you could have and you can strip those away one by one by one and bring it down a level bring it down a level and that can somewhere in there you may find a really unique approach you wouldn't normally think of um that you can still actually build or build a copy of that or build a mock of that or build something and that can be a creative way to get a cool idea that you might not normally think of some other places that you can find great quoting exercises to ship more stuff are our free code camp they have awesome exercises along the way and they also have lots of lessons as i'm sure you guys know if you're checking out this video but if you don't like free code camp projects are awesome that's where i got some ideas like the random quote generator um and there's also if you once you get done you can compare it to other people have done the same project which is also super helpful for javascript 30 by west boss this is one of my absolute favorite courses that i always recommend to people and it's totally free you can go in and he gives you like 30 bitesized sort of project that you can actually ship and make things on over about 30 days and this is insanely cool because it's you don't have to mess around with your development environment or a framework or something crazy it's all vanilla javascript there's some really cool like styling already baked in so you feel good about it and it feels like you're getting some quick wins so highly recommend that course um as like a quick one to get off the ground after you've uh brushed up on some of the basics of javascript the next thing uh it's just like if you were excited about learning something cool if you're excited about learning react or react native if you just really want to understand how databases work and how to work with them come up with an idea that just helps you learn that thing right come up with an idea that works really cool that works really well with react and you're excited about maybe it's totally useless or silly or whatever who cares like just make it and just focus on learning that technology and that's a great way to build your skill set and then the last one one of my favorite ones in the world is like just get paid to actually make things just get paid um i've gotten paid uh to do like freelance projects just web design and baking a little bit of javascript or try out some new css things or whenever i get to to put these things to practice uh at work um it's even better because i you know i'm spending maybe a few days of like you know my nine to five or squeezing a little time on a weekend and like i get recognition for it at work or i can get work resources or i get a chunk of my day that i get to focus on that so and this is especially good if you uh are like really busy or it's hard for you to carve out time on nights and weekends at home sometimes that happens sometimes you have kids sometimes you have a crazy schedule but if you can find a way like work with your boss work with the people um at your company to to get paid to actually learn this stuff and and make something that's valuable for the company to use uh or the client to use do that every time the sooner you can get to that even if it's just you know html and css even if it's just a little bit of simple javascript um that's a huge win because you're getting paid you're growing your skills and then you can level up and start doing more stuff making your own stuff getting paid more to do cool stuff for the same company you never know what opportunities that could unlock but it's been super powerful for me and then uh what to actually learn so yeah i've been focusing more on like on all this obviously on how you learn and the habits you build to learn because i really do believe that's more important than like a specific tech stack once you understand the fundamentals once you learn understand how to do this stuff once it's habitual and automatic and you don't even think about it switching from ruby to php or from javascript to you know whatever the next great thing is isn't going to be such a big deal but that being said it does kind of help to understand the lay of the land and so uh there's this great uh sort of like web developer road map flowchart that's super helpful at least when i was getting started to understand what's out there kind of where am i out of my journey on the front end of the back end and what things can i keep an eye out for or learn about um so that's super helpful highly recommend that you check it out i'm not going gonna walk you through it now but definitely an excellent excellent resource if you haven't checked it out before all right the second habit that i think is super crucial um when you're if you're gonna get your dream job in software uh is i recommend building a threecircle network so what i mean by that is normally when people think about networking they jump straight to like terrible networking events with like platters of food and people are like throwing their business cards at you and just like it's kind of like a i don't know this whole like sleazy used car salesman schtick and you just feel like people are talking at each other but not really connecting yeah nobody wants that um but what i think good networking is is just helping people and being part of the community and giving back and this starts with what i call like your inner circle so i think of it in like these three terms your inner circle uh your professional network and what i call the crowd and so we're going to start with the inner circle what is the inner circle your inner circle when you're starting out networking is like your mentors your peers and the people that you are helping immediately it's like a small core group of people these are people that you can like learn from and lean on for like these 10x big growth decisions uh or trajectory that you're on and like these tough decisions that you're making these are people that can help keep you accountable for your side projects that can help you get introductions for your first job that can um basically you can turn to for honest and helpful and real feedback um got this idea kind of from like a like a fivestar general i think i heard about uh and his habit at all times was to have three people in his life one who was a step ahead of him in his career for someone who had done the things that he wants to do who has experience who was wiser older and had value to pass down to him that he didn't know to ask for or and he can turn to that person when when he needs advice when he needs help also someone you respect that is like at your level but it's like best in class it is doing good work that can can keep like kind of light a fire onto you and keep you moving forward and show you what's possible at your level and you can get honest and real feedback that maybe isn't it doesn't make sense to get from a mentor and then of course like you've if you once you get your the next step that you want to take once you get that job that opportunity you get to ship that project it's i really think you have an obligation or an opportunity to turn around and help other people who were who were in your shoes a few months ago or a few years ago and so always being willing to help lend a hand to people and and pass that on pay that forward is i think so critically important and and i think everyone should take the chance to do that uh then there's also your professional network i think this is what most people think of when they think of networking um i tend to think of this just in terms of like who can i ask a favor from with a quick message this is i like people uh from like professional groups people from teclahoma probably or like free code camp would often fall into this i think uh another really critical thing to define in this stage is like a super connector so if you know there's like i have this friend when i was in college named maggie i and whenever we were working on a group project where we had to go like uh we're working on a project we had to go like interview professors or go find other students who knew uh who had specialties with different things i just asked her hey who do you know and she just send me over like a list of like all these people to get in touch with like immediately oh i know brad over here oh i know this professor over here oh i can call them a favor over here they just know all these people you want to know people like that in your industry and be building those connections so that when uh you know if something horrible happens and you lose your job like great you can reach out to that person they can connect you to the right people it's like hey i really need help with the side project i need help with this volunteer thing i'm doing who i don't know who to ask for who do you know you want those people who are super deeply connected especially if that's not your thing you want to know those people it's so helpful classmates family friends relatives former coworkers you know the point here is like you know more people than you think you do a lot of times you tend to discount oh i don't know any people in software oh i don't know any people with the kinds of jobs i want to have but you have friends you have family you have relatives and they might know people like that so feel free to like reach out and and connect with those people and look for the second and third degree connections who can get you in the door who can connect you with a super connector who can show you a professional group that you didn't know about um this is super key to positioning yourself to be able to get that job in 6 9 12 24 months whatever that is and then the crowd this is like who can i meaningfully help today i'm going to talk in a little bit about like sharing your byproducts and sharing what you're learning but the point is this is like social media email subscribers people who visit your website or blog or watch your videos or uh listen to your podcast whatever that thing is but um i i believe that once you like have your mentors and your peers and that close knit inner circle in place and once you have a professional network of of people that you can connect with and and be a part of that you should be like putting stuff out in the world like in your space so if you're like really into react like awesome uh how can you go help the react community how can you build a following how can you you know whether that's on twitter that's on youtube videos or whether that's teaching other people how to do something in your framework like find ways that you can help other people because that is going to come back around when you need it most especially when it comes to to landing a job and a lot of times it's it's hard to see what that'll look like but i've it's pretty people who build that habit of helping people and building a crowd and building an audience it usually comes back around in a good way to help them out and it's a huge advantage uh and this has just like totally been a key factor in like my journey like there's no way i'd be diving as deeply into marketing or software development if it weren't for like this huge crowd of passionate talented people who have like introduced me to new tech uh got me like involved in communities and got me excited about it uh like introduce new strategies uh for projects and code and doing exciting things uh giving me feedback and like blog posts and podcasts and courses and side project ideas and everything uh and like we talked about like actually keeping me accountable the ship work whether it's you know just like a blog post or a video or like putting together an api or whatever it is like having people around you at each of those levels the inner circle your professional network the crowd is going to be a huge help to actually getting stuff done um and there are like lots of other things that i learned in this sort of like networking journey but i think one of the main ones that that's helpful for everyone is just that don't get discouraged when people don't get back to you right away with your followup endless followup needs to be your new default i think so many times when i was reaching out um about jobs and when i'd meet a great connection for someone i wanted to to learn from uh sometimes they they wouldn't give back to me right away and it was so easy for me at first to attribute that to like oh they don't like me they don't think i'm any good or maybe they're they're just like hostile towards me but usually it's just busyness people are so crazy busy and i know i'm busy so many times uh and and so sometimes i won't get back to people as quickly as i should but it's you know that person might think i'm i'm mad at them but i'm not i'm not i'm just like super busy and if they keep following up i want to help them i want to connect with them i want to get to know them i'm so just making endless followup your new default is so critical um to making that happen i got encouraged by this story one time by this the ceo who once followed up with an investor 48 times in a row without a response and then on you know 47 times he you know he'd reach out every few days every few weeks whatever and and he would leave an email leave a message and just didn't get back to him on the 48th time that investor got back to him and said oh sorry i've just had a lot of fires burning i've been super busy uh can you meet tomorrow morning and they met and he invested in his company a lot of times you know people who you want to work with or who are doing great stuff are just super busy and so the more you can do follow up well have that endless followup that continual followup go the distance with that um to help them out um a lot of times as long as you're not doing that in an obnoxious way as long as you're doing that from a good place um and you're doing it and like doing the hard work of having something to show having something to bring to that meeting um making that worthwhile for both of you um that can actually be a great great experience for everyone involved um and so like this is like a general fault that i scheduled that i've used before um for jobs or getting coffee or just like finding mentors or things like that i'm just like reaching out and then making sure that i follow up like after two days after four days after a week after a few weeks and on and on and on to make sure that i don't let that slip through the cracks and that if uh something doesn't work out it's not because i was too lazy or forgetful um to do them the courtesy of like actually following through all right last habit number three sharing your byproducts this is a super key idea i believe and the reason why why does it matter of like sharing your byproducts and also what does this mean um let me share what this means first so if you're following all the stuff i've talked about you're connecting with people you're you're learning building first you're becoming a learning machine by creating these quick wins by creating the right inputs and the right forcing functions to force you to put stuff out in the world you're going to be learning cool stuff you'll be like you know messing around in javascript you'll be building websites you'll be creating apps you have these great side project ideas you'll you'll learn new things so you'll be creating stuff um and it's tempting to just just let that out and just let that sit you know i shift that thing great awesome move on to the next thing but what i believe you should do and i learned this from like uh this this article from the basecamp folks who are who makes this awesome app um and they put a lot of great blog posts out into the world but about like selling your byproducts um and about like if you are learning these things in real time if you are you the byproduct of that is like hey you have like a cool learning that went along with it uh as you were learning this as you were navigating it as you were encountering new problems and finding new ways to solve it other people would benefit from that if they just knew what you knew if you just documented the things that you learned the things you worked on and put it out in the world in a blog post and a video and a social media post anyway um even a lightning talk and a real person event speaking um that would help someone else and so often people feel like they need to to be a guru right to have it all together to have it figured out so they like put on their creator cap and they feel like they have to be some social media influencer or have to have done this for 30 years and know everything inside and out and write the book on it but that's actually not true you can help people by just documenting your honest experience of what you've been learning and just share that in a quick lightning talk share that in a quick social media post and a tweet another quick screencast and that can help people that is the byproduct of the hard work and the learning that you've already been doing so why not so the reason why sharing your byproduct is so impactful is because it helps others first off um which is so fulfilling and you've been helped by other people's you get to help them too that feels really good it is worthwhile to deal just for that but beyond that when you help other people you end up helping yourself too when you when you help people out in your community they're going to want to help you out too if you help them learn anything they want to hook you up with a new job they'll want to help you on your side project they'll want to help you fix that bug send people your way when you're hiring whatever that is you want to always be helping um and giving back to the community and then it just creates opportunities by showing your work putting it out on github sharing the process of why you built something a certain way that shows people how you think and people will be attracted to that people notice that stuff and then people who some people who might have overlooked you before realize wow okay this person actually knows what they're doing i really want to work with them i really want to hear them speak i really want to to hop on a side project with them or invite them in you never know what's going to happen but people can't discover the cool stuff you're doing if you don't tell them about it it's simple but it's so easy to overlook some practical um ways that this has looked for me uh it's just like whenever i get a chance to public speak i always say yes i it's so it was really like intimidating to jump into it first before i started public speaking it was my number one fear but once i hopped in once i muscled through it like it has been so rewarding and even though it's been scary um i've never regretted saying yes to a public speaking opportunity last year at teclahoma thunderplanes at this conference um i had never done a lightning talk before which is a line attack is like a five minute presentation in front of people kind of impromptu on just one simple idea that you want to share so i gave one on like how to market your side project and how to find great ideas and i gave that talk and one of the people in the audience was a developer at tailwind and so afterwards like he came up to me and said like hey man great talk um and we got to talking about his lightning talk about react and he introduced me to his coworker and we all chatted uh and then they just introduced me to the ceo of tailwind that went really well and they got me connected with the director of marketing and that got the whole interview process started and i eventually ended up hopping on board their team so it's if you actually connect the dots like me stepping out and giving a lightning talk actually opened the door to me getting like my dream job at a tech startup in oklahoma city um it's kind of crazy to think about like if i would have like sat down and had been too timid to do that that might not have happened or it might not have happened as fast which is is crazy um so again when when it came up my second year thunder planes of course i did a lightning talk and i didn't you never feel as ready as you want to you don't you never feel like those butterflies are like that it gets totally easy or not scary but it's always worth it and i always recommend doing that the other thing when it comes to documenting this stuff is just like keep it simple pick one primary channel and just stick to it if you love being on video just do videos um if you're on instagram all the time give it a shot just do a quick instagram post when you're coding and share what you're working on if you like writing stuff out in blog posts cool awesome that's great uh write a blog post after you finish like learning something or shipping some code do you have some friends and you just like talking about the latest and greatest like uh things in you know python that you're working on cool awesome sort of python podcast and and just document this stuff every week and just have a fun time doing it if you pick that one thing and you stick to it it gets way easier to build a crowd because you're talking about what you already know you have this forcing function of hey i'm going to make a blog post every week i'm going to put a podcast out every week it can be so so helpful another thing that i found is really helpful when you're figuring out well like what can i really talk about i feel like i'm rehashing the same stuff that everyone is talking about we don't need another you know uh todo list tutorial in javascript okay fine like i get that too like you want stuff that's going to stand out and it's something that only you can create um so at first i say just go back to row one you know always be shipping but beyond that once you get in the habit to or if you need something a little bit different i find this trick of like you're finding your superpower really helpful so this is an idea from like scott adams the creator of bilbert and his his idea is basically that you can could take two skills so for me like i started growing my marketing skills like early on and so i feel really confident that uh like that skills and then i also started like learning the code and software development and building apps and great okay cool so if i take the overlap between those two contrasting specialties that i have those two skills uh i have like marketing and development and so i can combine those and be like a marketing developer and find things okay cool marketing apis and okay cool how can we build a bot that helps people on your homepage and does these cool marketing things cool how can i automate my emails in this cool way that's like a cool marketing thing and you can find things that most developers aren't talking about and most marketers don't know how to do and that can be super valuable so yours will look different than this but you can find uh other things that are in addition to software development and layer them on top and that overlap is what you can talk about that's unique to you and really valuable and showcases uh what you're passionate about and what you're good at which can be make it a lot easier to get started just documenting this stuff another great thing about sharing your byproducts is it makes it so much easier to come up with ideas for things to actually make which goes back to one of the other problems and barriers that you you run into when you're trying to get started creating um and so i found it really helpful if you're putting stuff out in the world it becomes and you have people that are paying attention on twitter on your email list or at meetups it gets easier to like tap your community for these insights as you're ongoing so you can discover pain points right if you're like really involved in the javascript community and you have javascript friends and you're talking about this you can maybe discover a need for like a new package that you could write or a new open source thing you could start if you have an idea if you're starting a following uh for uh like marketers and you're coding things for them uh you can put out a quick tweet and be like hey would it be helpful if i coded this kind of things and you can validate ideas quickly and get feedback from the stuff you're working on uh which can be really really helpful it can help you validate ideas really quickly this is something that i've actually done as well um it's just like i had an idea for a site app that i wanted to work on to uh just like brush up on some coding skills like and so i was like okay what if i can make an app that'll help people meet up for coffee and like sink their calendars and find a free time for both of them so i just put up a quick thing on linkedin because i'm pretty active on linkedin and i get like 41 likes and 18 comments i got like a list of i followed up with each and every one of those people oneonone you can see even some of these people i don't know these people they're seconddegree connections and so i was still able to connect with them grab their emails and follow up with them and i didn't actually end up getting as far with that app as i wanted yet um but when i have something to show on my next side project i'm going to plan on like repeating this process and like reaching out making a list and reaching out to people and that way i can i can develop it faster come up with more ideas avoid that block and get more of those quick ones and always be shipping um so and this just came from like documenting the the stuff i was going to work on i didn't i wasn't even planning to post about this side project that i was working on i was like oh it's small it's silly who really cares but more people cared than i thought and so giving this a chance just documenting it and putting it out there in the world uh was a huge advantage and i'm super glad that i did so those are really like the three ideas um in a nutshell that took me from like not really knowing how to code or feeling like i want to be a lot of ways who started to stop so many times to actually getting my foot in the door meeting the right people having the skills built up and and sharing what i was doing to where like i was able to to join this awesome job at tillwind and i love going to work every day i work with some of the best people on the planet and and i'm so happy that i get to do it it's exciting it's fresh it's fun and like i i'm even more excited for like my side projects because the things i'm learning at work like feed into the things i'm doing outside of work in coding and marketing in in the people that i'm meeting and so and and the things the people i'm meeting outside like feed right back into work and make me more excited and it's such a cool place to be and so i'm so glad i started those habits you know like 12 to 18 months ago of just like putting my learning on autopilot building those those networks and hopping in the oklahoma city community uh starting to document my work these things make such a big difference over the long run and so that's my experience um again uh hit me up on linkedin twitter email me whatever i'm happy to talk more about um these ideas and what they're like yeah cool thanks guys so much for listening appreciate it take care
