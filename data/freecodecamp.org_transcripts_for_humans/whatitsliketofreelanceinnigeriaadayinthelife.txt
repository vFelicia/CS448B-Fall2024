00:00 - hello everybody my name is peter
00:02 - ambanugo and i'm a software developer
00:04 - from nigeria
00:06 - i'm working on a
00:08 - real-time state synchronization service
00:12 - and i should be able to launch it by the
00:14 - end of the month this match
00:16 - i currently work from home that's where
00:18 - i do most of my work i have a small
00:21 - office set up in
00:23 - an unused room here and maybe not too
00:26 - small
00:27 - quite okay and comfortable for me
00:30 - i can show you my decks now
00:33 - so this is my
00:35 - small home office
00:38 - i have just
00:40 - a macbook pro
00:42 - without an external monitor by planning
00:44 - that
00:46 - um here
00:49 - i will keep some small quotes which i do
00:52 - meditate on reflect
00:54 - on this my
00:56 - internet modem
00:59 - for my current project which is a
01:00 - real-time state sync
01:02 - library
01:04 - state sync service
01:06 - i just started working on it and i
01:09 - decided to start with the dashboard so
01:12 - i
01:14 - practically start off my morning with
01:17 - positive intent
01:19 - by reading and reflecting on
01:24 - some audios already
01:27 - a
01:27 - chapter from
01:29 - a book called daily stoic by ryan
01:32 - holiday
01:35 - i
01:36 - that's the first thing i read after
01:39 - before i get to start my work
01:42 - reflect on the words on it
01:44 - then i
01:45 - do some gratitude exercise by
01:50 - by listening some
01:52 - gratitude you
01:54 - like this
01:56 - which i use today
01:58 - or days which i use most of the
02:01 - time
02:04 - after the gratitude exercise i do listen
02:07 - to some motivational
02:09 - inspirational thoughts too
02:12 - to keep my mind boosted and energized
02:16 - so today i listen to
02:19 - this
02:20 - recording
02:23 - and yesterday i listened to this
02:25 - so they helped me to
02:28 - get started with the day
02:30 - with high energy and
02:32 - clarity
02:35 - and
02:37 - some people do start off the idea with
02:39 - emails
02:41 - i sometimes don't look at my email
02:46 - and sometimes
02:50 - i quickly check my email to see if
02:52 - there's any important
02:54 - email coming in that needs to affect how
02:56 - i arranged my day because i do
02:59 - organize my activity for the day the
03:02 - night before so that i can get started
03:04 - immediately
03:07 - so
03:08 - i already have in mind what i'm going to
03:10 - work on for today and after my
03:13 - reflection i'm going to kick start my
03:16 - day with
03:17 - some coding on aws london api gateway
03:22 - i
03:22 - write down my activity for the day
03:26 - on
03:27 - documented visual studio code
03:31 - and
03:34 - you can see what i have for today
03:36 - i do track my
03:38 - the time spent on activities
03:41 - on a tool called kanban flow which i use
03:44 - for time tracking
03:47 - and i have various both here
03:51 - and
03:53 - it helped me with time management
03:57 - i use that to
03:59 - respect at the end of the week to see
04:01 - how much
04:03 - i spent and in what areas i spent them
04:06 - on
04:08 - and they chose the pomodoro technique
04:11 - for me i used 20 minutes time in tower
04:14 - and in a day i aim for
04:17 - three to four hours of focus work not
04:20 - including break times
04:22 - so in total including breaks about i
04:24 - spent about five
04:26 - hours on my laptop five six hours
04:31 - walking
04:33 - but try to do focus work for three to
04:36 - four hours
04:38 - sometimes
04:40 - during my short breaks i do come out to
04:43 - stretch and
04:45 - get a feel of the sun
04:47 - as
04:48 - today it's quite sunny
04:50 - and very hot
04:53 - as you can see
05:06 - so i'm trying to
05:09 - purely small
05:10 - service
05:12 - with slamdan
05:14 - aws flanders api gateway
05:18 - i'm near to using the wwe slambandgate
05:21 - api gateway so followed some basic
05:24 - instruction from their documentation
05:28 - and i've been able to set up a quick
05:30 - lambda
05:31 - and i think the ui is quite easy to use
05:35 - and i've been able to
05:38 - set up
05:39 - some things
05:40 - just with the click of some buttons
05:43 - and it's worked for me and except that
05:46 - i've not been able to
05:48 - connect the api gate with a connected
05:51 - vehicle to an api gateway
05:53 - to give a proper response so i'm getting
05:57 - an error here
05:59 - and i've done a quick google search
06:02 - which has pointed me to
06:04 - this resource
06:06 - that i need to set the response code
06:13 - so i'll be setting up a response code so
06:17 - it behaves properly
06:36 - i run this test again
06:39 - i expect to get a different result
06:43 - so here is saying successfully completed
06:47 - and it works
06:49 - so part of
06:51 - my day involves trying to
06:55 - figure out some
06:57 - new things on how to use things by going
06:59 - through documentations online or
07:02 - equity google search so that i have not
07:04 - going through long tutorials
07:07 - because there are a lot of things in the
07:08 - documentation you need to take weeks to
07:10 - go finish all of them and
07:12 - i just need to achieve
07:15 - what i need to achieve as soon as
07:17 - possible
07:19 - so quick
07:21 - do it yourself and google search helps
07:23 - me
07:24 - to solve this problem
07:30 - so today after walk um
07:33 - i decided to go for a run
07:36 - and i'll be
07:37 - doing a five kilometer today
07:40 - i do this sometimes after walk
07:43 - in the evening on fridays or saturday
07:46 - so today i'll be going for my room
