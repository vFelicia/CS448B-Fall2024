00:00 - all right today we're going to be
00:01 - talking about data networks you've heard
00:04 - of networks before maybe a water Network
00:06 - a road Network even a television network
00:09 - or a cell phone network today we're
00:11 - talking about data networks which are
00:13 - the networks that computers use the
00:15 - three types we're going to cover in this
00:17 - video are the local area network the
00:19 - wide area network and the virtual
00:21 - private Network a local area network is
00:25 - just a small group of computers that are
00:27 - connected together the most important
00:30 - thing about a local area network is that
00:32 - those computers are close together so
00:34 - your Wi-Fi at Starbucks or at a school
00:37 - that is local area network that you can
00:39 - only connect to if you're actually close
00:41 - to that a wide area network is two local
00:45 - area networks that have been connected
00:47 - over a long distance so maybe a School
00:49 - in Colorado wants to connect with a
00:51 - school in Missouri they could use a wide
00:54 - area network you might think that those
00:56 - are connected over the internet and in
00:58 - the case of a virtual private private
01:00 - Network which accomplishes basically the
01:02 - same thing as a wide area network it is
01:05 - vpn's use the internet to connect their
01:07 - two local area networks however a wide
01:10 - area network will usually rent a cable
01:13 - from an internet company and connect
01:15 - that way so just to review a local area
01:18 - network is a group of computers
01:20 - connected close to each other a wide
01:22 - area network and a virtual private
01:24 - Network are two local area networks or
01:27 - more that have been connected over long
01:29 - distance es the wide area network
01:32 - accomplishes this by renting a line from
01:34 - an internet company and a virtual
01:36 - private network does it over the
01:38 - internet
