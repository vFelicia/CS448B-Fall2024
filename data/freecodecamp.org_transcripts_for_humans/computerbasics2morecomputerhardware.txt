00:02 - Let's quick review.
00:03 - The four basic parts 
of a computer are:
00:06 - the Input–like the mouse 
or the keyboard
00:08 - The Output– what you're 
seeing on the monitor
00:10 - or hearing through
 the speakers
00:11 - the CPU– the 
Central Processing Unit
00:14 - and the Memory.
00:15 - Now Memory can be short-term 
memory called RAM
00:18 - or longer term memory. 
That is usually is a hard drive,
00:21 - but can also be like 
a CD-ROM or Flash Drive
00:25 - anything like that.
00:26 - In addition to those 
four basic parts,
00:28 - we have three more things 
we're going to discuss today.
00:30 - The Motherboard, Expansion Cards, 
and Power Supply.
00:34 - The Motherboard is what 
connects everything.
00:37 - While the data is flying 
around over here
00:38 - trying to figure out 
where to go,
00:40 - the Motherboard 
helps route it.
00:42 - So it goes to the 
right place.
00:44 - Expansion cards are 
sound cards, video cards,
00:46 - that kind of thing that 
can really up your experience
00:49 - as a user.
00:50 - Power supply is 
as it sounds–
00:52 - what gets power 
to the computer.
00:54 - It's usually the part of the 
computer that has that fan on
00:56 - it to keep it from overheating.
00:58 - So let's do a quick review.
01:00 - In addition to the 
four basic parts of
01:01 - Input/Output, Central Processing Unit, 
and Memory
01:05 - We usually have a

Hi, I'm Briana from freeCodeCamp. Let's quick review. The four basic parts of a computer are the Input–like the mouse or the keyboard The Output– what you're seeing on the monitor or hearing through the speakers the CPU– the Central Processing Unit and the Memory. Now Memory can be shortterm memory called RAM or longer term memory. That is usually is a hard drive, but can also be like a CDROM or Flash Drive anything like that. In addition to those four basic parts, we have three more things we're going to discuss today. The Motherboard, Expansion Cards, and Power Supply. The Motherboard is what connects everything. While the data is flying around over here trying to figure out where to go, the Motherboard helps route it. So it goes to the right place. Expansion cards are sound cards, video cards, that kind of thing that can really up your experience as a user. Power supply is as it sounds– what gets power to the computer. It's usually the part of the computer that has that fan on it to keep it from overheating. So let's do a quick review. In addition to the four basic parts of Input/Output, Central Processing Unit, and Memory We usually have a Motherboard, Expansion Cards, and a Power Supply.
