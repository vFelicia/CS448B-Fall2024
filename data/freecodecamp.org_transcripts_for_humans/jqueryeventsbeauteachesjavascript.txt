00:00 - in my last video I introduced jQuery in
00:03 - this video I'm going to talk a little
00:04 - more about jQuery events so here's a
00:08 - basic event so I'm going to select a
00:11 - paragraph tag and then I'm going to
00:13 - attach a click event so when any
00:16 - paragraph is clicked this function right
00:18 - here is run and in the console it's just
00:21 - going to say you clicked a paragraph now
00:23 - in my last video I told you that your
00:25 - code should usually be in a document.
00:27 - ready function to make sure the document
00:29 - is fully loaded before the other code is
00:31 - run while it is still used document.
00:34 - ready is now deprecated and there's a
00:36 - more concise way to do the same thing
00:39 - I'm going to put this whole thing in
00:40 - another function we're going to just put
00:42 - a dollar sign and then we're going to
00:45 - put this in a function here now instead
00:48 - of document. ready it's just dollar sign
00:51 - and then the function so I'm going to
00:52 - take this here and put it right in here
00:55 - there we go let's try this out okay now
00:58 - when I click this paragraph you click
01:00 - the paragraph you click the paragraph
01:02 - you click the paragraph and if I had
01:03 - multiple paragraphs every paragraph
01:05 - would have that same click event so in
01:08 - jQuery most Dom events have an
01:10 - equivalent jQuery method here's some
01:12 - more common ones we have um double click
01:16 - Mouse enter mouse leave Mouse down Mouse
01:22 - up and hover so let me show you some
01:26 - examples of here so if I just put Mouse
01:28 - leave here okay now when I click the
01:31 - paragraph nothing happens but if I make
01:32 - my mouse leave the paragraph it's going
01:34 - to say you click the paragraph it really
01:36 - should say you left the paragraph So
01:38 - double click Mouse enter mouse leave
01:40 - Mouse down Mouse up these are pretty
01:42 - self-explanatory now the hover method
01:44 - takes two functions and is a combination
01:47 - of the mouse enter and mouse leave
01:49 - methods so so the first function is
01:52 - executed when the mouse enters the HTML
01:54 - element and the second function is
01:56 - executed when the mouse leaves the
01:58 - element so
02:00 - let me show you an example of
02:03 - that okay so there's two functions
02:06 - they're just separated with a comma
02:07 - here's the first function comma and then
02:09 - we have the the second function here so
02:12 - if I run that when I enter the paragraph
02:16 - you entered when I leave the paragraph
02:18 - you left I also want to show you some
02:20 - common form events so we have Focus blur
02:25 - and
02:26 - change so if I add an input field here
02:31 - okay so now I'm selecting the input
02:33 - field that I added up above and we're
02:36 - going to do the focus event so in the
02:39 - focus event that just means when it gets
02:42 - focused so if I click into this input
02:44 - field it's going to say you did
02:46 - something down in the console and blur
02:49 - is when you leave the input field and if
02:52 - you do change that's just if the text in
02:56 - the input field changes so if I put
02:58 - hello here it says you did something if
03:01 - I say buy and then it says you did
03:04 - something again because the text changed
03:06 - from Hello to buy I had to hit tab to
03:09 - exit the field before it recognized that
03:11 - the text changed now all of the events I
03:15 - have showed you so far are actually just
03:17 - shorthand for the on method let me show
03:20 - you what I mean so if we go back to the
03:23 - original um click method on the
03:25 - paragraph here so we we have this click
03:28 - event this this could be written
03:30 - differently instead of Click we're going
03:32 - to put on here now we're going to pass
03:35 - in the word
03:39 - click and then we s the function so now
03:42 - it's paragraph onclick So when you click
03:46 - the paragraph you're we're going to run
03:48 - this function and that's going to act
03:50 - just the same way so if I click this
03:52 - paragraph you click the paragraph when
03:55 - you use the on method you can do some
03:57 - additional things for instance it is
03:59 - easy to add multiple events so after
04:02 - click here I'm going to put Mouse enter
04:05 - now you can put any number of events
04:07 - here as long as they are separated by
04:09 - the space character so I'm going to run
04:11 - that now when I enter the paragraph it's
04:15 - going to say you click the paragraph and
04:17 - when I click a paragraph it's going to
04:18 - say you click the paragraph so this will
04:20 - bind the same action to multiple events
04:24 - you can also use the on method to bind
04:26 - different actions you can pass an object
04:29 - into on
04:30 - with one or more key value pairs with
04:32 - the key being the event name and the
04:34 - value being the function to handle the
04:37 - event so here's the example of this
04:40 - inside the on method we have this object
04:43 - here and inside the object there are two
04:45 - key value pairs so key is click the
04:48 - value is the function we're going to run
04:50 - key is mouse over the value is the
04:51 - function we're going to run here so
04:53 - let's run that and see what happens when
04:56 - the mouse goes over it says hovered when
04:58 - I click it says say clicked and you can
05:01 - also remove an event listener with the
05:03 - off method so let me put in this we're
05:07 - going to select a
05:08 - pag. off click we're going to turn the
05:11 - click method off the click event handler
05:13 - off so if I go over the paragraph it's
05:15 - going to say hovered if I click the
05:16 - paragraph nothing's happening I'm
05:18 - clicking but nothing's appearing in the
05:20 - console because we turned off the click
05:22 - Handler and there's one final thing I
05:24 - want to show you which is that you can
05:26 - set up an event to run only once with
05:29 - with the one method you can change the
05:32 - on to one you on now it's one it's just
05:36 - going to run once so before it would
05:38 - show hovered even every time I went over
05:41 - it so I'm going go over it once go off
05:43 - it go over it again and it's not showing
05:46 - hovered again even though I'm moving my
05:48 - mouse on and off of it it only runs one
05:50 - time if you use the one
05:53 - method okay that's jQuery events thanks
05:57 - for watching my name is boars don't
05:59 - forget to subscribe and remember use
06:01 - your code for good

in my last video I introduced jQuery in this video I'm going to talk a little more about jQuery events so here's a basic event so I'm going to select a paragraph tag and then I'm going to attach a
