00:04 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:06 - with jesse i'm jesse and today i want to
00:10 - do a recap of the project that we just
00:12 - launched
00:14 - and go over like how we did it the
00:17 - decisions that we made why we made them
00:19 - uh and then talk a little bit about the
00:21 - the next steps uh for for what's gonna
00:24 - happen i also have some nice analytics
00:27 - to share with you just about you know
00:29 - how well the site's doing
00:31 - and um
00:33 - so we're not really gonna do a lot of
00:34 - coding right now um it's gonna
00:38 - be more like just kind of overview also
00:40 - um you know feel free to ask questions
00:44 - uh definitely open to questions
00:46 - and also i want to give you a little
00:48 - update on like my situation uh for work
00:51 - and everything because there's gonna be
00:52 - some changes coming up
00:54 - uh so that's the plan for today
00:58 - uh sorry for the short notice on the
01:00 - stream too i
01:02 - i was just really busy and didn't um
01:05 - i wanted to stream but i didn't get it
01:07 - scheduled early enough so there maybe
01:09 - had been some issues with notifications
01:11 - not being received
01:12 - um but hopefully
01:15 - looks like
01:16 - you know there's a lot of you in the in
01:17 - the stream so i'm hoping that everything
01:20 - works with the notifications
01:22 - okay
01:24 - so first uh let me explain
01:26 - uh some of the the changes right i don't
01:29 - want to leave anybody in suspense right
01:31 - so
01:32 - uh i am most likely uh going to be
01:36 - leaving my position right now uh at the
01:38 - university and finding employment
01:41 - somewhere else so if you follow me on
01:43 - social media you probably already know
01:45 - this
01:45 - uh i've i've received already uh
01:48 - thankfully us a lot of uh not not direct
01:53 - offers but
01:54 - a lot of invitations to apply uh to
01:57 - places and offers from people to um to
02:00 - recommend me
02:02 - so i'm very grateful for that and thank
02:05 - you so much to everyone who who
02:07 - retweeted my tweet or shared it on
02:10 - on instagram
02:12 - or on linkedin
02:14 - uh thank you so much for that uh the the
02:16 - response and the reach that that got is
02:19 - just amazing
02:20 - and um
02:22 - i like i'm very very grateful thank you
02:24 - thank you so much for that
02:26 - so
02:27 - uh i don't know
02:29 - where i'll be at and i'm not sure how
02:31 - quickly i'll be
02:33 - i'll be leaving here so for now
02:36 - um
02:39 - i i guess i'll still be working on this
02:41 - project and i'm still gonna do my stream
02:44 - so i'm gonna i'm gonna keep doing my
02:46 - stream and then depending on what
02:49 - position i get
02:52 - we'll just have to see i'd love to keep
02:54 - doing the stream it may be that i won't
02:56 - be able to stream my everyday work but
02:58 - i'll have to stream the side project
03:01 - and it may be you know maybe the stream
03:03 - has to
03:05 - has to move to like a saturday or maybe
03:08 - it's going to be in the evenings instead
03:10 - of in the morning so
03:12 - um
03:13 - so there are probably going to be some
03:15 - changes to the stream but not just yet
03:18 - out um
03:19 - i'll still be streaming
03:22 - although uh
03:23 - next week i may not be able to stream
03:25 - that much
03:26 - because i will be
03:27 - at uh react training
03:30 - in washington dc so i'm excited about
03:32 - that to learn some new stuff
03:35 - um
03:36 - so
03:37 - just to give you a little heads up
03:40 - too about why why this is happening um
03:43 - so
03:44 - as you all most of you know who have
03:47 - watched the stream this project we've
03:48 - been working on since january
03:51 - has launched
03:54 - it would launch like two to three weeks
03:55 - ago but if you go to the website now if
03:58 - you go to the url you'll see the old
04:00 - website
04:01 - so uh unfortunately
04:03 - is somebody higher up in the
04:05 - organization
04:06 - for some reason unknown to me
04:11 - didn't like the website and instructed
04:14 - the it department to change it back to
04:16 - the old website and this was all without
04:19 - consulting me
04:21 - so at this point i don't know what the
04:23 - problem was
04:24 - i have some guesses but that's just
04:26 - based on stuff i've heard from other
04:28 - people
04:30 - so
04:31 - i don't know why the site was taken down
04:34 - i've gotten
04:36 - no attempt to contact me to explain
04:38 - anything or to ask me to change anything
04:41 - as we'll see in a second the site was
04:44 - definitely meeting the requirements and
04:46 - surpassing them it was
04:48 - based on the analytics it was already
04:50 - hitting our goals for what we wanted the
04:53 - site to do
04:54 - and as far this this person that made
04:57 - the call didn't even look at the
04:59 - analytics
05:00 - um
05:01 - i
05:03 - from from everything i understand about
05:04 - it the call was made without
05:07 - without that so um and this person's
05:11 - actually somewhat new to the
05:12 - organization and hasn't even been
05:14 - involved in the process so this is
05:16 - pretty like kind of disturbing to me
05:18 - um
05:19 - and so i mean that was okay that was
05:22 - definitely a hit to the ego but what
05:24 - really pushed me over the edge is just
05:25 - the way it all happened uh from what i
05:27 - understand
05:28 - um
05:30 - you know the people who did actually get
05:32 - to talk to this person
05:34 - uh say he was he was not very nice about
05:37 - the whole thing um
05:40 - treated treated people in a way that no
05:42 - one should be treated right
05:44 - so
05:46 - given that i just don't feel comfortable
05:49 - being around if
05:50 - you know one of the main people in
05:52 - charge is is treating people like that
05:54 - um
05:55 - so
05:58 - what i'll do is i'm going to try to make
05:59 - sure that
06:01 - people know about it
06:02 - um
06:03 - hopefully somebody will do something
06:05 - about it
06:07 - but
06:08 - you know at the end of the day it's it's
06:10 - not an environment that i want to be in
06:12 - so while i'm still here i'm going to do
06:14 - whatever i can to try to make it better
06:16 - for the people that are staying
06:18 - um but then i you know i gotta get out
06:22 - it's
06:23 - uh so like you know personally you know
06:25 - i struggle with depression anxiety and
06:27 - things so
06:28 - i'm
06:29 - i was just been not feeling very good
06:31 - the last couple of days i'm pretty calm
06:33 - now
06:34 - i actually have a really bad headache so
06:37 - when i get anxiety usually that caffeine
06:39 - makes it worse so i totally cut caffeine
06:41 - out yesterday
06:43 - and i've been getting these headaches i
06:44 - think maybe i was drinking too much
06:46 - caffeine and now i'm going through
06:47 - withdrawal so
06:49 - my head hurts so bad right now but i
06:52 - know
06:53 - based on my past experience situations
06:55 - like this could make me have a panic
06:57 - attack so i don't want to chance that
06:59 - so i'm just trying to be as as calm as i
07:01 - can
07:02 - and just keep doing what i'm doing
07:05 - you know talking to people uh about new
07:07 - job opportunities and
07:10 - you know thinking about
07:13 - okay how do i want to work my resume you
07:15 - know i'm thinking about maybe redoing my
07:18 - personal website since i haven't touched
07:20 - it in years
07:21 - uh
07:22 - you know been talking with my wife
07:24 - about what we want to do
07:26 - and been thinking about ways to just
07:28 - address the situation
07:30 - in the most professional way possible
07:34 - without
07:36 - the way i see there are several options
07:38 - like i could freak out and be very
07:40 - unprofessional about this or i could
07:42 - just try to hide and i don't want to do
07:44 - either right i don't want to hide
07:47 - because i don't want this to happen to
07:48 - other people in the organization and i
07:51 - don't want to freak out because that'll
07:52 - probably make things worse so i'm trying
07:54 - to find a middle ground to
07:56 - get the word out in a very logical way
07:59 - um
08:00 - to the people that need to know
08:03 - um and and make a good case
08:06 - uh for
08:07 - for not only this site but for
08:09 - um
08:11 - you know for making sure that people are
08:13 - treated with respect
08:15 - uh so
08:18 - yeah so i um
08:20 - anyway and i it's it was just one person
08:23 - right so this is not like a huge
08:25 - organizational thing um
08:27 - you know i
08:28 - generally over my three years here
08:31 - you know 99 of people have been very
08:34 - friendly you know just even over the top
08:36 - like beyond what you'd expect people to
08:38 - be
08:40 - so this is a new individual here
08:42 - unfortunately they have a lot of
08:44 - authority
08:46 - so
08:47 - i don't i don't really know this person
08:49 - i haven't even gotten a chance to know
08:50 - them so i'm not
08:52 - i'm not even sure what to think about it
08:54 - you know
08:56 - um other than it shouldn't it shouldn't
08:58 - no one should ever treat another person
09:00 - like that
09:02 - okay
09:03 - so let's get on to
09:06 - the site is some happier stuff i'm
09:08 - actually still like i'm really proud of
09:10 - this site despite what this other person
09:13 - may think
09:14 - like objectively speaking we did a good
09:17 - job with this site uh the the technology
09:20 - is sound it's you know somewhat cutting
09:23 - edge
09:24 - um
09:26 - i think uh we accomplished what our
09:28 - goals were
09:30 - right so if someone wanted to disagree
09:31 - with what the goals were in the first
09:33 - place
09:34 - you know that's understandable they
09:35 - could do that but in terms of does this
09:37 - website meet the goals does it does it
09:40 - me does it fulfill the requirements of
09:42 - the project i think
09:43 - most definitely it does
09:45 - um
09:47 - so let's check out the analytics first
09:50 - and let me give you if you're not sure
09:52 - what website i'm talking about this is
09:54 - the one that we built i still have it up
09:55 - at a
09:57 - um
09:59 - at a test link that i had running anyway
10:01 - so i never took down the tesling
10:04 - and uh i just want to say hi i see a lot
10:06 - of activity in the chat so let me
10:08 - um
10:09 - let me switch up to this screen you can
10:12 - see it for a second and i just want to
10:13 - say hello to everyone
10:15 - um so hey um
10:19 - i see there are some questions i'll get
10:20 - to some of the the more like technical
10:22 - questions in a second but i want to
10:24 - answer any questions that have to do
10:25 - with what we just talked about first
10:28 - um
10:29 - carl asked if i'd still on my live
10:31 - stream no matter what i do want to try
10:34 - as hard as i can to keep doing this live
10:36 - stream
10:38 - as long as you all think that it's
10:40 - valuable to you and to the community i
10:42 - will i want to keep doing it
10:51 - yeah steven says so no feedback no
10:53 - mock-up changes what the heck yeah i
10:55 - mean that's
10:56 - it's it's a
10:58 - it's an unprecedented situation i've
11:00 - never had this happen before you know uh
11:02 - for someone to be dissatisfied with with
11:05 - your work but then give absolutely no
11:07 - feedback
11:17 - um
11:19 - mario says thank you for being open and
11:21 - saying uh as it is you you're welcome i
11:24 - yeah i mean i just especially for you
11:26 - all that have been with me here through
11:28 - this project for so long
11:30 - i
11:31 - i want you all to know what's really
11:32 - going on you know
11:34 - um
11:36 - when i say this even though this is live
11:38 - and anybody could watch it like
11:40 - it doesn't feel like i'm just announcing
11:42 - this to the public right like
11:44 - we've all been together many of us for
11:46 - you know well over a year
11:48 - working on projects you know so you're
11:51 - you know we have a community here you
11:53 - know we have a team here so you all
11:55 - deserve to know why the work that you
11:58 - some of you have actually contributed
12:00 - code and many of you contributed ideas
12:02 - so this is all very much our work why
12:03 - it's not there anymore
12:10 - and it says that person acts very mature
12:12 - we are supporting you in your decision
12:14 - thank you thank you so much i appreciate
12:16 - it
12:18 - okay
12:20 - all right so let's let's check out then
12:23 - um some of the analytics and then maybe
12:26 - um
12:28 - we'll see what it looks like in terms of
12:30 - questions in there maybe go over some
12:31 - stuff so
12:33 - i'm gonna make this as big as i can
12:36 - but
12:37 - here's the analytics that i i was
12:39 - impressed i was honestly surprised at
12:41 - how good some of these numbers were i
12:44 - mean i know
12:46 - it's one thing to to have an idea and a
12:48 - plan
12:49 - and and no
12:51 - you know have a good idea that it will
12:52 - work and it's another thing to actually
12:54 - see the results so i'm gonna go over
12:56 - these really quick
12:58 - uh especially for those of you who are
12:59 - just listening and can't read this
13:01 - i took the analytics and i actually
13:04 - removed steubenville the city that the
13:06 - university is in from the results
13:09 - right because that uh
13:11 - the target audience is not people
13:12 - already on campus and most of our
13:15 - students don't actually come from
13:16 - steubenville so we remove stevenville
13:18 - completely so
13:20 - i compared uh the same time period in
13:23 - 2017 to the time period the website was
13:26 - live
13:27 - because
13:28 - we're trying to track like applications
13:31 - and that's very cyclical so the only way
13:33 - to be fair about it is the same time
13:35 - period in in that same year right
13:39 - so
13:39 - we had
13:40 - 67
13:43 - decrease in page load times right which
13:45 - was expected right we knew it was going
13:47 - to be a lot faster home page even
13:49 - greater decrease
13:51 - uh the next number i think is really
13:53 - important so we're targeting prospective
13:55 - students right we want them
13:57 - to come to our website want them to
13:59 - apply to learn more about this
14:00 - university so
14:03 - google analytics doesn't let you
14:06 - it doesn't show you data specifically
14:07 - about people under 25 but you can tell
14:10 - because
14:11 - if you just take the total number of
14:13 - visits minus
14:15 - all the visits from the age groups they
14:17 - do give you data from which starts at 25
14:20 - and goes up to however high
14:23 - somebody can live to
14:25 - then we can get a better idea of okay
14:27 - well the group that's left over is
14:30 - younger than 25
14:32 - they are most likely majority made up of
14:34 - people who
14:36 - um
14:38 - are in that group that age group of our
14:41 - target audience so anyway we have a 48
14:44 - increase in people visiting our site
14:47 - from that from that age group which is
14:49 - great
14:50 - uh because that's what we were we had in
14:52 - mind the entire time uh we had an
14:54 - increase in visits to the application
14:56 - uh of seven percent increase which is a
14:59 - really nice a nice increase i need to
15:01 - get the data on the inquiry form too i
15:03 - forgot to do that but that's also an
15:05 - important form that we're trying to
15:07 - drive people to
15:08 - um we actually had a big increase in the
15:10 - time spent on the home page which is
15:12 - interesting because the old homepage was
15:15 - huge
15:16 - it took very long a long time to load
15:18 - partly because there's so much content i
15:20 - mean very small text images videos
15:23 - everywhere and you could scroll for
15:25 - three days through it it was long you
15:27 - can see it now at the main website it
15:30 - you know the old website is back online
15:31 - now
15:32 - but the interesting thing is we got rid
15:34 - of all that and had a very minimal
15:36 - simplistic home page
15:37 - and we had an increase of people's of
15:40 - the time spent on the home page by 48
15:43 - and you know from just looking at that
15:47 - face value kind of trying to figure out
15:49 - why
15:49 - you know i think the busyness of the old
15:52 - homepage was a turn off it was
15:54 - overwhelming
15:56 - and when we actually broke it down and
15:58 - only showed people some very important
16:00 - facts
16:03 - they they stayed and they read those
16:05 - so
16:07 - there may be other ways to interpret
16:09 - that but that seems
16:10 - like a pretty good way um
16:13 - to kind of view that statistic to me
16:16 - and it's almost counterintuitive right
16:17 - we we gave them less content
16:20 - and then they ended up spending more
16:22 - time on the page
16:24 - um also i'm not going to go through
16:26 - every department but you
16:28 - like one of the big things we wanted to
16:30 - do is show that we have good academic
16:32 - programs here where we are a catholic
16:34 - school and we have a well-known
16:36 - reputation for being catholic
16:38 - so
16:40 - based on our market research we already
16:41 - know that
16:42 - that people don't doubt that but what
16:44 - people doubt is our academics they don't
16:47 - know if we're actually good academically
16:48 - so there are students that would like to
16:50 - come here
16:52 - because they're catholic students and
16:53 - they they want to be here but
16:56 - they're not sure they'll get a good
16:57 - education here
16:58 - so
16:59 - what we were trying to do is appeal to
17:01 - those students
17:03 - by showcasing
17:05 - our
17:06 - academic programs right on the home page
17:09 - and you know we succeeded in bringing in
17:11 - more people so you could see the masters
17:13 - in theology had a bit of an increase
17:16 - some of these like theology program had
17:18 - a 275 percent increase in traffic to
17:20 - that page so you can see just some of
17:22 - the other programs here
17:24 - um
17:25 - some really big numbers here uh huge
17:28 - increases so
17:31 - you know based on these analytics i
17:33 - think we definitely succeeded
17:35 - in in our goals
17:37 - uh for this website right and and this
17:40 - was just really
17:42 - the first phase i mean you all know
17:45 - there are so many ideas for what we
17:47 - wanted to do
17:48 - that are going to come later on or were
17:50 - going to come later on probably not now
17:53 - um
17:54 - so really this is comparing a site that
17:56 - had already gone through a whole year
17:58 - development from an old agency working
18:00 - on it and talking about the old site and
18:02 - then years of development after that
18:04 - comparing it to a site that just came
18:07 - out
18:08 - and
18:09 - you know basically we've done
18:12 - just kind of me and you all have done
18:15 - for less than a year
18:17 - launched it
18:18 - and had very little time to make any
18:20 - improvements and we still had these kind
18:22 - of numbers i mean i to me i think that's
18:24 - that's very impressive i'm proud of it i
18:26 - think you all should be proud of it
18:28 - because you're a big part of it so no
18:29 - matter what happens with this site
18:32 - um
18:33 - this is a successful site and the data
18:35 - shows it
18:37 - um you you can't
18:39 - you can't argue the the numbers um
18:43 - so
18:43 - anyway
18:45 - i wanted to share that with you
18:48 - because i think that's it's just so
18:49 - impressive and um you know all the
18:52 - thought that we put into this site and
18:55 - uh you know everything
18:56 - uh it it paid off
19:00 - okay let me
19:03 - i guess i don't need to show anything
19:04 - right now let's just put this in the
19:06 - background because we're just gonna talk
19:08 - about stuff for a little bit so uh i'm
19:10 - going to take
19:12 - a little bit of time right now to answer
19:14 - some of the questions that you have and
19:16 - then we're going to dive into
19:18 - some of the technology
19:20 - just to refresh your mind in case you
19:22 - haven't been watching these streams this
19:24 - was built with react with next js we're
19:27 - using apollo graphql
19:29 - we use node
19:33 - wordpress for the content management
19:35 - system with a wp graphql plugin we have
19:38 - algolia now for search which i did
19:40 - finish
19:41 - and implemented so you can try out the
19:44 - search now it's way faster
19:48 - we're using google cloud platform to
19:50 - host most of this cloud sql
19:53 - um
19:55 - and
19:56 - what do we have cloud sql the the cloud
19:59 - storage bucket uh and we're using app
20:01 - engine to host the react app we're using
20:03 - digitalocean
20:04 - uh for the wordpress
20:07 - application or the wordpress
20:09 - installation so
20:11 - all those technologies went into this so
20:12 - if you have questions about any of those
20:14 - technologies why we use them or anything
20:16 - feel free to put them in there now i can
20:18 - go into a lot more detail about it
20:22 - hey harshit's here uh and we'll only be
20:24 - around here for a few minutes
20:25 - says now all we need is a good svg
20:28 - loader for the loading screen yeah for
20:30 - sure i am i thought about that the other
20:32 - night um you know sometimes you just
20:34 - think about a project at nighttime
20:36 - you're not even working on it it just
20:37 - occurred to me like
20:39 - we still have the words loading come up
20:41 - when you're looking like we never
20:43 - actually put a real loader in there and
20:45 - we did on the on the search page so i
20:47 - thought well at the very least we can
20:49 - just grab what we did on the search page
20:51 - and then put that in for the loader on
20:53 - all the other pages in place of the
20:55 - words loading so
20:58 - that'll probably be on the list
21:01 - but once again i don't really know how
21:03 - much more work i'll be doing on this
21:05 - unfortunately because
21:07 - you know we still had a lot of good
21:08 - things that could have been done
21:11 - so let me
21:15 - i'm going to scroll up and answer some
21:17 - questions here
21:21 - uh sedek said is it possible to build a
21:23 - kickstarter clone with react.js oh most
21:25 - definitely
21:26 - yeah
21:27 - uh you can definitely do that in react
21:30 - um
21:32 - i
21:33 - i think probably any site on the
21:35 - internet could be redone
21:37 - in in react because
21:39 - it's it's javascript in html and css
21:42 - which is what everything's built out of
21:44 - um it doesn't even matter what the back
21:46 - end is really
21:49 - so you could you could remake really
21:52 - anything
21:53 - you know any ui
21:55 - you know whatever and react components
22:09 - romani says how to make a big web app
22:11 - with react
22:13 - um
22:15 - i mean if you're going to make something
22:16 - a big one it's
22:18 - i
22:19 - you can definitely do it with react i
22:21 - would just if it's going to be really
22:22 - large structure is important um so in
22:27 - that case
22:28 - i would most definitely think about
22:30 - reusability of your components so like
22:32 - your actual
22:34 - code base can remain small and
22:38 - easy to work with
22:40 - uh
22:41 - sometimes in smaller projects
22:43 - and i know we've done it and we've done
22:45 - it in this project sometimes is we'll
22:47 - say ah you know what we could really
22:48 - refactor this and reuse it but
22:50 - let's just get this done quick and do it
22:53 - and then you may or may not ever go back
22:54 - and redo that
22:56 - now if the project starts to grow and
22:57 - grow and grow
22:58 - that could really make things difficult
23:01 - to navigate
23:02 - and your project could just balloon and
23:04 - your code base gets huge
23:06 - so i would be more care if you know
23:09 - right above the bat it's gonna be a very
23:11 - big project then you should be more
23:13 - careful about
23:14 - um
23:17 - things like that like how are you gonna
23:19 - handle that structure and things like
23:21 - that and
23:22 - make sure that that's all planned out so
23:25 - that you don't have those moments where
23:26 - you just say ah you know we could do it
23:28 - like this but it'll be faster to do this
23:31 - you know it you can get away with that
23:34 - when it's not that large but you
23:36 - on a large application it could down the
23:38 - road uh not be good for you
23:42 - so if you have any that's kind of really
23:44 - like a large topic so you have any
23:45 - specific questions you know please let
23:47 - me know
23:54 - uh diy coder says the work is really
23:57 - good appreciate this hard work but using
23:58 - react for making website is this
24:00 - overkill or is this the way to do it
24:02 - uh yeah i mean you could say this is
24:04 - overkill
24:05 - we definitely
24:06 - you know we could have built this
24:08 - website using something else right uh
24:11 - you could
24:14 - i would say this though like i would
24:18 - i have no idea how i would have worked
24:21 - out all the routing for this if we were
24:23 - doing this in let's say just plain
24:25 - javascript and i had to do like i don't
24:27 - know i used like jquery for my to do
24:30 - custom routing it would have been insane
24:32 - it's already insane using you know react
24:35 - uh state management would have been a
24:37 - huge problem so
24:39 - uh this website in particular we had so
24:42 - much content coming over like it let's
24:45 - just say for instance
24:47 - i try to do it in wordpress
24:50 - that also would have been a huge thing
24:52 - uh in terms of
24:53 - making sure all the urls work right
24:59 - it would have been
25:02 - it i think it would have been very
25:03 - challenging and difficult to do this
25:07 - in in
25:08 - other in other ways so
25:11 - in this particular case even though it's
25:13 - just a website
25:15 - being able to use react in the whole
25:17 - react ecosystem helped me a lot
25:21 - but you're right normally for a website
25:23 - react is potentially overkill
25:26 - although to be honest with you
25:29 - if you use create react app to start up
25:31 - a website really quickly
25:34 - um
25:35 - it's
25:36 - it's really easy to build out a site
25:38 - with react um
25:40 - you know potentially even easier than if
25:42 - you were to just do a straight html css
25:46 - than other javascript site
25:49 - okay now it depends like if you're not
25:51 - used to react of course react is going
25:53 - to be really difficult
25:54 - but you know it's
25:57 - it's so the barrier to entry for react
26:00 - is so low now
26:01 - and that's a good thing
26:03 - uh that
26:07 - you know it it doesn't feel like
26:08 - overkill right to build anything in
26:10 - react
26:12 - so
26:14 - um
26:16 - yeah so i would
26:20 - yeah i would say for a regular website
26:23 - it potentially could be overkill but
26:25 - it's not
26:27 - like it's not the end of the world right
26:28 - if you're gonna
26:30 - um
26:31 - uh do something in uh and react at least
26:34 - that's that's the way i feel right it's
26:37 - um it all depends on your project what
26:40 - the resources are how much time you're
26:41 - going to take and what your level of
26:43 - ability is with it right
26:50 - then i'm sorry if i'm not as with it as
26:53 - i normally am it's just my headache is
26:55 - i try to take some painkillers my
26:58 - headache is not getting better at all
27:12 - uh limbaugh says i'm new here thanks in
27:14 - advance for sharing i'm in need of
27:16 - inspiration to study on oh well thank
27:19 - you so much for watching and welcome
27:22 - and um
27:24 - yeah for inspiration
27:28 - i would just say
27:32 - i want to say like keep at it keep
27:34 - getting better every day you'll be
27:35 - amazed at how far you've come in a month
27:38 - you know in in a year
27:40 - you'll look back and it
27:42 - it'll be
27:43 - it'll be like wow i
27:45 - you know like i i couldn't do i couldn't
27:48 - even think about doing what i'm doing
27:49 - now a year ago you know you you'll hit
27:52 - that moment and it feels really good
27:57 - all right and oops says which is better
27:59 - angular or react it definitely
28:03 - def oh um
28:06 - someone wants the old website link i'm
28:08 - gonna type it in right now
28:14 - okay so the old website which is now
28:16 - live in place of this one i just linked
28:18 - here
28:19 - uh so
28:21 - you can check out the old website
28:25 - it may take a while to load
28:31 - all right okay so the question was
28:32 - angular vs react it all depends on your
28:35 - situation
28:37 - on your project
28:39 - uh on what you're good with you can
28:41 - build really awesome things or really
28:43 - terrible things with either one
28:46 - so
28:47 - the the way to go is just look at the
28:49 - strengths and weaknesses of react and
28:52 - angular and look at what you need to do
28:54 - for your project and the strengths and
28:56 - weaknesses you have or your team has
28:58 - and then you pick which which you have
29:00 - to pick so it's it's not a
29:03 - an answer that you can give a blanket
29:05 - answer over everything right
29:07 - uh it definitely depends on specifics
29:14 - hopefully that makes sense
29:17 - i know it doesn't help it's easier if
29:19 - you can just have a this is the best
29:21 - thing go with it but that's not really
29:23 - how this this works
29:46 - um limbaugh says trying to understand
29:49 - why next js is needed okay the reason we
29:52 - went with next.js is for server-side
29:54 - rendering okay so if you're not familiar
29:56 - with nexjs
29:58 - uh
29:59 - it's
30:00 - it works with react right so you you run
30:03 - next js it builds out the basics bare
30:06 - bones of all your react project it
30:08 - handles your webpack config and it gives
30:10 - you a basic like file structure and it
30:13 - handles routing for you
30:16 - in this case we have custom routing but
30:19 - normally it handles the routing for you
30:21 - but what it does that is really awesome
30:24 - is server-side rendering by default
30:27 - why do we need server-side rendering
30:29 - because search engines won't be able to
30:31 - see your content right so they won't
30:33 - stick around long enough to wait to make
30:36 - the api call to get the data back and
30:39 - display it on the page right all click
30:41 - client side
30:42 - but
30:43 - when you render on the server what gets
30:45 - sent to the search engines when they
30:48 - come to your site and anybody else who
30:49 - comes to your site for
30:52 - they get html html css right
30:57 - all there
30:59 - and
31:00 - then after that what next will do
31:04 - is offer client-side routing so you
31:06 - really get the best of both worlds you
31:08 - get that server-side routing for that
31:10 - really fast
31:11 - initial load time
31:13 - and the
31:14 - um
31:15 - the ability for search engines to see
31:17 - your content
31:18 - and then after that you get that speed
31:21 - of it it actually pre-fetches content
31:26 - so that when a user clicks on a link
31:28 - sometimes they actually have
31:30 - instantaneous load so zero second load
31:33 - time
31:34 - because the data is already there so
31:36 - really awesome
31:38 - uh it definitely helps out
31:40 - right i
31:41 - i
31:43 - would not want to have to handle
31:45 - all the stuff that it does in the
31:46 - background on my own so they do a great
31:49 - job
31:50 - it's it's updated so frequently
31:53 - and it's very very reliable
32:00 - uh zubair says is this project going to
32:02 - be an app react native expo app well
32:04 - it's it's a progressive web app
32:07 - um so
32:09 - that's what we ended up building
32:12 - uh max says is python's still a good
32:14 - idea to learn yeah absolutely there's a
32:16 - lot of good work in um machine learning
32:19 - happening with python as far as i know
32:22 - uh so
32:23 - it depends on what you're into which you
32:25 - want to work with but
32:27 - you know python is definitely worthwhile
32:31 - uh marcio says hey jesse thank you for
32:34 - doing this you're welcome uh great value
32:37 - uh question how do i know that i'm ready
32:39 - to start learning a framework from your
32:41 - perspective of course
32:47 - if you have a good understanding of html
32:49 - css and at least basic javascript
32:52 - then i would say go ahead and learn the
32:54 - framework especially if there's a
32:56 - project that you want to use it with you
32:58 - think it would be beneficial
33:00 - um it can definitely help it could help
33:02 - you make some good stuff you know faster
33:04 - than you you would otherwise be able to
33:07 - um if there's a framework that a you
33:10 - know would look really good on your
33:11 - resume then that's you know that's a
33:13 - great bonus to to be able to have that
33:14 - on there if you've worked with it so
33:17 - just make sure though that you keep up
33:19 - your skills
33:21 - so as you're using this framework
33:25 - try not to get
33:26 - locked in too much depending on the
33:28 - framework it's it's easier harder to do
33:30 - that but make sure your your vanilla
33:32 - javascript skills still improve
33:35 - right your css html is still improved so
33:39 - as long as you're doing that and not
33:40 - really locking yourself in i think
33:42 - you're fine of course if you want to
33:44 - lock yourself in you know go ahead and
33:45 - do it but
33:46 - it does it may make it a bit harder down
33:49 - the road if that particular framework
33:51 - falls out of fashion uh it may make it
33:54 - harder to switch if you don't keep up
33:55 - with some of the other stuff
33:58 - hopefully it answered your question
34:05 - uh it says harsha by the way
34:07 - franciscan.edu going to the old site for
34:09 - me
34:11 - uh is it removed maybe i missed
34:13 - something at the beginning
34:15 - yeah
34:18 - yeah okay let me paste this so this is
34:22 - harsha you did miss something so uh if
34:24 - you want to at some point if you have
34:25 - time go back and watch the first couple
34:27 - of minutes
34:28 - um
34:29 - but basically
34:31 - the short story is uh the old website is
34:35 - back up and the new website that we made
34:37 - has been taken down
34:41 - but you can still see it at that
34:43 - the link that i just pasted in
34:53 - michael cruz says
34:55 - i want to watch live but i really want
34:56 - to know what's happened since yesterday
35:01 - so you go back
35:03 - can you go back and rewind and just
35:05 - watch the first 10 minutes and then come
35:07 - back
35:09 - you watch it on double speed and you'll
35:10 - catch up i guess
35:17 - okay
35:18 - uh rush
35:20 - rushikesh
35:22 - sorry if i'm mispronouncing this uh but
35:24 - they say i'm just a beginner in web
35:26 - development
35:27 - uh before react
35:29 - what
35:30 - should i learn or clear my basics yeah
35:32 - uh html css javascript focus on those if
35:36 - you're a beginner
35:37 - and um and and you'll be fine with that
35:41 - and then whenever you need to use a
35:43 - framework
35:45 - and you start working on more complex
35:47 - things
35:48 - when a framework will really help you
35:50 - then jump into that framework
35:53 - phoenix says hey jesse what's up
35:56 - congratulations i guess i can say that
35:58 - now right also i saw your instagram
36:00 - status
36:00 - uh was this a contract project
36:03 - no um
36:05 - so i explain a lot of it in more detail
36:07 - in the first 10 minutes of the stream
36:09 - but just you know long story short i
36:11 - will be i'm going to leave my position
36:14 - you know i'm most likely going to leave
36:16 - my position here at the university and
36:18 - find another job so if you want to know
36:20 - why that's happening watch the first 10
36:22 - minutes of this video
36:26 - let's see
36:27 - uh
36:29 - zhang zhao i'm not sure i pronounced
36:31 - that apologies um it says i'm currently
36:35 - only comfortable with html css and
36:36 - javascript for the front end part how do
36:40 - i get the big picture when it comes to
36:42 - web development like how does the front
36:43 - end talk to the back end
36:45 - um
36:47 - yeah i would say
36:49 - you know probably look up some tutorials
36:51 - and courses if you go through the free
36:52 - code camp lessons
36:54 - at some point it transitions into that
36:57 - you know after you learn a lot of the
36:58 - front end stuff
37:00 - so that'll give you a good idea about
37:02 - how that that part works
37:06 - yeah so i mean you don't have to go
37:07 - through everything but if you just kind
37:09 - of skip to that part and kind of look
37:10 - over what's going on that may give you a
37:12 - good idea about what to focus in on more
37:15 - you know to be able to find some videos
37:17 - or um
37:19 - you know tutorials about it
37:23 - uh zooper says what database are you
37:25 - using my sql wordpress api yeah so we
37:27 - have my sequel
37:29 - and we're using the rest api and
37:32 - actually are we even using that anymore
37:35 - i think we're all graphql now
37:37 - uh we did use the rest api for search
37:40 - but now we switch to algolia for search
37:42 - so now i think we're using graphql with
37:44 - wordpress
37:47 - so we use the plugin called wp graphql
37:50 - to be able to use graphql
37:52 - with it
37:55 - michael creo says there's no such thing
37:56 - as just the website yeah
38:00 - it's always more
38:05 - it's really hot in my office so i'm
38:07 - going to turn my fan on low
38:13 - so if it's too noisy let me know
38:18 - but it's like it's insanely hot so i
38:21 - just need to need a little fan there
38:28 - it says swan says hey jesse why have you
38:31 - chose react instead of polymer or vue.js
38:33 - for example okay really good question
38:36 - um
38:38 - so
38:40 - let's see i
38:44 - don't know very much at all about
38:45 - polymer so it wasn't even really on my
38:47 - radar as a possibility i knew a little
38:50 - bit about vue but i had never used it
38:52 - before on uh on a project
38:55 - and when we first started working on
38:56 - this project the timeline was very
38:58 - condensed we ended up getting a very big
39:01 - extension on the timeline
39:03 - but you know a lot of the reasons for
39:04 - that are
39:06 - determined by people you know higher up
39:08 - above me in the organization so
39:11 - uh when we initially started
39:14 - i needed to go with something that i
39:16 - already knew and we had already built
39:18 - several things in react
39:20 - we already had a lot of code that i
39:22 - could knew i could reuse
39:24 - so that's why we ended up going with
39:26 - react
39:27 - had i had all the time in the world to
39:30 - learn and try something else
39:32 - i'm not sure if i would have gone with
39:34 - react i think it definitely worked in
39:36 - this situation
39:38 - so i'm not saying react was the absolute
39:40 - best way to go for this but given the
39:42 - constraints of the project it was the
39:44 - way to go
39:46 - uh for us for this for this project
39:51 - limbaugh says what you just said there
39:53 - helps me a lot
39:54 - oh awesome really glad i could help
39:58 - um nobody says you may not remember me
40:01 - but i do remember you uh you may not
40:03 - remember me but last year i used to pop
40:05 - on these streams and uh you inspired me
40:08 - to take uh programming what a year now i
40:11 - am
40:12 - i'm now a semi software engineer working
40:15 - in a real react project oh awesome i'm
40:18 - so glad you came back and told me that
40:20 - and i i do i remember i remember um i
40:24 - remember the name at least of you coming
40:26 - in here and talking so
40:28 - um that's so cool
40:30 - i love it whenever i hear things like
40:32 - that so
40:34 - that's really awesome if if you get a
40:36 - chance pop back in sometime and you know
40:38 - let me know how your project's going
40:42 - uh nasar says how are you
40:45 - uh
40:46 - i'm okay
40:47 - i'm okay i've been better a lot of stuff
40:49 - going on right now you could watch the
40:51 - first 10 minutes of this video uh if you
40:53 - want to know more about what's happening
40:56 - um but like right now i have a really
40:58 - really bad headache it just keeps
41:00 - getting worse so
41:01 - um
41:02 - but other than that i guess i can't
41:04 - complain i got a great wife and four
41:07 - healthy children and
41:09 - so
41:10 - i shouldn't complain
41:13 - you know
41:14 - it could be a lot worse
41:20 - uh diy coder says yes component reuse is
41:22 - a huge plus and routing also
41:25 - yeah for sure definitely agree with that
41:28 - harshit says algolia search for now it
41:31 - is gonna be expensive um
41:34 - let's see
41:36 - i lost my place
41:38 - it's gonna be expensive monetary costs
41:40 - there yeah uh
41:42 - so right now i'm just on the essentials
41:44 - plan so the lowest paid plan
41:47 - and since the site's not live i it's not
41:50 - going to be a big deal for now
41:53 - but yeah i
41:56 - for the time that it was live i was
41:58 - trying to monitor it
42:02 - sorry
42:04 - oh
42:06 - um
42:10 - i lost my train of thought i'm really
42:11 - sorry
42:13 - oh when i did when the site was live uh
42:16 - i had my
42:18 - dashboard for um
42:20 - algolia up
42:22 - all the time on all my computers so i
42:24 - always knew it was happening
42:33 - lisa he says feel better thank you i
42:35 - appreciate it
42:39 - a mod learns code says hi there have a
42:41 - nice day everyone hey how's it going
42:43 - thanks i hope you have a nice day as
42:45 - well
42:47 - phoenix says
42:48 - also since the time i started working on
42:50 - my blog site i have learned
42:52 - i've had learning i've had a ton of
42:55 - learning
42:56 - uh and the things that can go wrong are
42:57 - endless also it's now that i realize how
43:00 - important good a good documentation is
43:03 - yeah yeah documentation is good i i
43:06 - often slack on the documentation myself
43:09 - um
43:10 - but that's a good point
43:14 - limbaugh says wow awesome i really
43:16 - needed this
43:17 - uh cool i'm glad i'm glad you like this
43:23 - carabbo says the old site looks dated it
43:25 - it does it really does um it was very
43:28 - surprising to me when they switched back
43:30 - because it was pretty much unanimous
43:32 - from everybody i talked to that
43:34 - they did not like the old site so um
43:40 - and
43:41 - you know it was pretty much the
43:43 - consensus that like anything would be an
43:45 - improvement as long as it was faster
43:48 - um so yeah i was i was very
43:52 - surprised by it
43:58 - ours it says i just remember
44:01 - did you
44:02 - enable uh material ui css minification
44:05 - before prod uh command you in the page
44:08 - and check
44:09 - if not that will speed the page up by
44:11 - another five percent oh okay
44:14 - um
44:15 - that is a good tip i don't even remember
44:18 - i don't recall ever doing that
44:23 - let's see
44:36 - let's see our sources
44:38 - styles
44:40 - oh no that's not it
44:53 - no it's not i'm wondering like where are
44:56 - bundled styles coming from
45:00 - i don't think it's this no that's not it
45:03 - this is our just tiny bit of css which
45:05 - actually i didn't minify that either
45:09 - anyway i don't know how to check that
45:10 - out but
45:12 - that's good and see that's the thing too
45:13 - like the site was very fast
45:16 - and we hadn't we've done almost nothing
45:18 - to optimize the speed
45:20 - right like
45:22 - even the images aren't optimized we
45:24 - didn't run them through uh image
45:27 - compression or anything like that
45:29 - it was just so it was fast
45:31 - so all that stuff was gonna come later
45:34 - um
45:35 - but
45:37 - you know shaving so much time off that
45:39 - load time by switching the site was was
45:41 - worth it even if it wasn't completely as
45:43 - 100 optimized as it could be
45:46 - it was still really good
45:50 - uh i'm online learning code said i've
45:52 - heard about koa js
45:55 - can you explain the purpose of this
45:56 - technology briefly thanks potatoes i
45:59 - don't really know very much at all about
46:01 - koa so uh i am sorry about that but i
46:05 - i don't know enough to uh to give a good
46:07 - explanation
46:08 - if anybody else knows anything about koa
46:10 - please uh let me know
46:13 - roland says what is react i don't have
46:15 - any idea of this react is a javascript
46:17 - library for building uh web apps
46:21 - and you can build other things with it
46:22 - too
46:26 - yeah that's pretty
46:30 - it's like the basic
46:33 - concept of react um so
46:36 - yeah so it helps you to build
46:39 - uh to build websites and web apps
46:42 - and
46:45 - it it's very helpful with things like
46:47 - state management
46:54 - harshed says
46:57 - oh okay it says cola js server side
46:59 - framework built by the same people
47:00 - working on express uh jesse might not
47:02 - know about it because he mostly does
47:04 - front end you're absolutely right
47:06 - uh co is used for making performant apis
47:09 - okay cool thanks harshit
47:13 - matt desja says good morning all good
47:14 - morning thank you for uh for watching
47:17 - and stuff and in the live chat
47:20 - limbaugh says game says is access fus
47:23 - part of the same app or completely
47:25 - separate app it is completely separate
47:27 - um so it's actually run by an entirely
47:31 - different company different servers
47:33 - everything
47:34 - i don't have access to it although i was
47:36 - able to send
47:39 - a style sheet
47:41 - to this company and have them upload it
47:44 - so i was able to adjust the styles a bit
47:47 - make it a little bit more like material
47:49 - design style
47:50 - and
47:52 - but that was that was about it is it's
47:54 - pretty limited
48:10 - matt justice says uh best of luck in
48:12 - your transition jesse thank you so much
48:14 - i appreciate it
48:18 - uh roland says i'm curious about react
48:20 - nodes something like that even though i
48:22 - don't know uh any of those yeah it's uh
48:26 - react is a javascript library to build
48:28 - things like maybe like on on the client
48:31 - side like front end stuff node is using
48:33 - javascript on the back end so server
48:36 - side javascript
48:44 - a ish says graphql so uh graphql it's uh
48:48 - query language right so
48:50 - normally if you wanted to get well
48:52 - there's several ways to get data right
48:54 - but one way to get data um to your your
48:57 - front end is to use an api right and and
49:00 - the standard right now is kind of like
49:02 - rest apis
49:04 - um it's like a method of creating an api
49:07 - and getting data from it but the latest
49:09 - thing is graphql
49:12 - and the main difference is with a rest
49:15 - api you pre-build these these api
49:18 - endpoints and when you
49:19 - send a request to the endpoint you will
49:22 - get back a certain amount of data in a
49:24 - certain structure
49:25 - um
49:26 - based on what was already
49:29 - you know pre-made for that endpoint to
49:30 - give you in graphql when you send the
49:33 - request you tell graphql exactly what
49:36 - data you want and it sends you back just
49:39 - that data right no more no less so
49:43 - you uh you can end up making less api
49:46 - calls
49:47 - because
49:48 - right you don't have to hit multiple
49:50 - endpoints to get all the data you want
49:51 - and then the total amount of data that
49:53 - gets transferred is less
49:54 - because you just get what you want so
49:57 - um
49:58 - it is in that respect graphql was most
50:01 - definitely you know better
50:03 - um
50:04 - than
50:05 - a rest api in terms of how you build it
50:07 - on the back end i don't know enough
50:08 - about that to really know the pros and
50:10 - cons of it all but that's kind of
50:13 - i guess the
50:14 - the most concise way i can put uh you
50:17 - know what is graphql what is the
50:18 - difference between graphql and a rest
50:20 - api
50:22 - roland says where can i learn php
50:24 - um
50:25 - a lot of places i guess uh maybe if
50:27 - you're really new um
50:30 - try out
50:31 - uh like codecademy
50:34 - they have these like interactive courses
50:36 - uh i've done some of their courses
50:38 - before i almost positive they have a php
50:40 - course so i would check that out first
50:43 - michael says okay i'll watch later from
50:44 - the beginning just don't burn any
50:46 - bridges that you might need later it's
50:47 - always darkest before the dawn that is
50:50 - good advice i appreciate that uh thanks
50:52 - michael
50:54 - mattheson says oh feel better jesse i
50:56 - hope so and thanks for saying that
50:59 - uh limbaugh says health and long life to
51:02 - you all thank you thank you and you too
51:06 - um john f says how did free code cam
51:08 - contact you about streaming here um i
51:11 - started doing live streaming on my own
51:12 - channel and i did a few live streams and
51:15 - i i knew that i didn't really know what
51:17 - i was doing so i posted in the free code
51:19 - camp forum a link to my live streams and
51:22 - i asked if anybody would be able to give
51:24 - me advice on how to do a better job
51:26 - and beau karns who does a ton of awesome
51:30 - javascript tutorial videos for free code
51:32 - camp
51:33 - contacted me and asked if i'd be
51:36 - interested in live coding for free code
51:39 - camp uh and then shortly afterwards i
51:42 - also talked to quincy who's the head of
51:43 - free code camp
51:45 - and then i just i started doing live
51:48 - streams and they went well uh people
51:50 - watched them you know quincy and bo like
51:52 - them so
51:53 - here i am i
51:55 - still still doing the streams
52:03 - let's see mark marcio says thank you
52:05 - thanks for answering my questions i hope
52:07 - you keep doing this kind of live
52:08 - question answer take some advil and rest
52:11 - uh
52:12 - thanks thank you
52:14 - for that advice i think i i probably
52:16 - will
52:17 - just go home after the stream and and
52:19 - relax a little bit
52:24 - nobody says yes i'll pop back more often
52:26 - i can now start to understand what was
52:28 - going on unlike last year thank you all
52:30 - right cool
52:31 - very cool
52:32 - um
52:33 - stephen says hey jesse i twitter message
52:36 - you austin texas there's a ton of react
52:38 - jobs available
52:40 - uh indeed you ship rooster teeth etc all
52:42 - here oh really cool thank you so much
52:46 - um jennings al says hope you feel better
52:49 - if you have time exercise yeah that's
52:51 - true i didn't get my my regular workout
52:53 - in today or yesterday uh so i i need to
52:57 - work out
52:58 - like today
52:59 - um
53:01 - or else i'm gonna it's definitely gonna
53:03 - impact my mental health if i if i quit
53:06 - with my workouts
53:08 - um
53:10 - aish says is routing there in both react
53:13 - and node.js
53:15 - yes yes so we have both server side and
53:17 - client-side routing
53:20 - stephen says
53:22 - plus pay
53:24 - says plus pay is way higher in austin
53:27 - yeah that's for sure well one thing is
53:28 - i'm almost guaranteed to be paid more at
53:31 - a new position than i am paid
53:33 - here
53:34 - higher education uh doesn't neces
53:37 - especially at a non-profit institution
53:39 - doesn't really pay as well as
53:42 - other
53:43 - other industries
53:50 - limbaugh says is there a video where you
53:52 - talk much about price to maintain an app
53:54 - this size uh yeah so
53:59 - an app like this right now
54:01 - and while it was live i believe we were
54:04 - spending maybe like 500 a month on all
54:07 - the hosting and everything that goes
54:10 - with that
54:15 - and that 500 it might have been a little
54:16 - bit overkill because i didn't want the
54:18 - site to go down or slow up so it
54:20 - potentially after the site had been live
54:22 - for a while we could check the analytics
54:24 - and fine-tune things we might have been
54:25 - able to get that cost down a little bit
54:27 - more
54:28 - but that cost includes a server a
54:30 - droplet on digitalocean
54:32 - um cloud sql database and google cloud
54:34 - platform also on google cloud platform
54:37 - app engine
54:38 - instances and
54:40 - storage buckets
54:42 - and then included with that cost is also
54:44 - the cost of the algolia search
54:48 - service
54:52 - there are a few other things we want i
54:54 - wanted to add in that would have cost
54:55 - more so i wanted to add in sentry for
54:57 - error tracking
54:59 - and i also wanted to add a cdn
55:02 - so those would have brought the price up
55:04 - a bit more maybe another 100 bucks or so
55:07 - maybe 200 depending on the traffic
55:15 - steven says g fuel coffee i know i'm
55:18 - trying to cut out caffeine but man maybe
55:20 - i should just
55:22 - maybe i should just give in
55:24 - caffeine
55:27 - um
55:29 - chang yon
55:30 - song
55:32 - sorry about the name says hello it's 2
55:34 - a.m in korea first time to watch a live
55:36 - and ask a question uh what would you
55:38 - recommend to study before learning react
55:40 - um says someone already asked sorry for
55:43 - answering this again
55:44 - uh yeah no problem it's uh i learned
55:46 - html css and javascript
55:49 - and that's that's all you need before
55:50 - you learn react
55:54 - irish it says just watch the first 10
55:55 - minutes feel better thank you i
55:57 - appreciate it
56:00 - emiliano says hi jesse here from
56:02 - argentina greetings
56:04 - hey how's it going thanks for watching
56:07 - um shadrach says greetings from nigeria
56:10 - um let's say
56:15 - uh ch changgyon says uh thanks actually
56:19 - i'm studying javascript i was just
56:20 - wondering if there's more yeah no
56:22 - javascript's good you know and then you
56:24 - should be able to jump into react it'll
56:26 - take a little time to get used to it but
56:29 - if you're solid with javascript then
56:31 - you know go ahead and jump in
56:36 - um
56:41 - let's see
56:43 - five
56:45 - i'm not sure how to pronounce this
56:47 - um but anyways which frame shirt
56:49 - framework should i use for back end
56:52 - um
56:54 - i don't know i mean i like express would
56:55 - you consider expressive framework i'm
56:57 - not really sure what to call it but i i
56:59 - usually use node and express
57:01 - i but i mean it really just depends on
57:03 - like a lot of factors for what you're
57:05 - trying to do
57:12 - um which course is better
57:15 - today's generation
57:17 - i'm not exactly sure what you're asking
57:18 - so maybe clarify that a little bit
57:20 - please and i can i can answer
57:23 - um
57:25 - harsh it's saying click view source of
57:27 - course
57:28 - why wouldn't i remember a view source
57:31 - because i only use view source when i
57:33 - accidentally click it when i'm trying to
57:34 - hit inspect
57:37 - and
57:39 - yeah it looks like it's not even
57:40 - minified
57:42 - well that's awesome
57:45 - i'm actually really happy about that
57:47 - because that means we can make this even
57:52 - faster cool
58:00 - phoenix says i would like this
58:02 - opportunity to thank you for all these

61:13 - 500 um
61:16 - is a
61:20 - i would say not that much at all for a
61:22 - larger organization i mean like the
61:24 - university employs
61:27 - like four or five hundred people
61:29 - you know so for our organization that
61:31 - size five hundred dollars a month is not
61:34 - not really that much um
61:37 - you know we probably spend more than
61:38 - that on
61:39 - water electricity internet like pretty
61:42 - much every other thing that we have
61:59 - i'm really sorry i'm having trouble
62:00 - pronouncing this
62:03 - why are you
62:05 - sorry uh says hey jesse
62:08 - i'm experienced with react js node.js
62:10 - and mongodb how do i come up with ideas
62:12 - for side projects that have potential to
62:14 - generate income and future and become my
62:16 - own startup
62:18 - um
62:19 - i don't know that's that's if if i knew
62:22 - a really good answer to that question
62:23 - then i'd probably do it too
62:25 - um but
62:26 - yeah i mean i would say if you're
62:29 - looking for good ideas of things that
62:30 - people actually want to use so you can
62:32 - make money from just uh ask people
62:34 - around you like
62:36 - what what do you wish you could do like
62:38 - what what things in your life do you
62:40 - wish could be automated or enhanced or
62:43 - somehow with you know something on your
62:45 - phone or whatever right um think about
62:49 - what you do every day like is there
62:50 - something you could build that would
62:52 - help you
62:53 - odds are if you build something and it
62:55 - helps you it'll probably help other
62:57 - people so think that's a good place to
62:59 - start right and then if you build it
63:01 - nobody wants it well at least you build
63:02 - something cool that'll help you out
63:04 - right so you haven't lost everything
63:05 - right
63:07 - um bill corn says i came in late and
63:09 - just watched the beginning of the stream
63:10 - i'm so excited to hear that jesse
63:12 - uh that jesse is looking
63:15 - isn't looking for a job because he was
63:16 - fired jesse is awesome thank you thank
63:19 - you so much about yeah yeah i i was not
63:22 - fired i don't think i will end up being
63:24 - fired so
63:26 - it was not it was not fired so this is
63:28 - of of my own free will
63:32 - um matt duchess says vitamin b works
63:34 - better than caffeine yeah you're right
63:36 - actually i think i do have some vitamin
63:39 - b pills at home so
63:41 - maybe i'll just take that when i go home
63:50 - oh okay so then one of the names i
63:52 - couldn't pronounce is siddharth but it's
63:54 - it's written with uh like half in in
63:58 - numbers so
63:59 - okay i kind of thought it might be
64:01 - something like that but
64:02 - i was trying to limit how silly i
64:04 - sounded so i just didn't try it
64:07 - thank you for telling me though and if
64:09 - i've mispronounced anyone's name please
64:11 - let me know how to pronounce it and i'll
64:12 - do my best to remember that and
64:13 - pronounce it the right way every time
64:17 - uh himanshu says what to learn to start
64:19 - making websites html css and javascript
64:23 - that's what you need you learn those
64:24 - you'll be good and you can build you can
64:26 - build anything with that
64:30 - delay b says what back end should i
64:33 - learn with react there is no job with
64:36 - node.js and i don't want to do php um
64:43 - i don't know i mean if you can't find a
64:45 - job with node something what else do
64:46 - people use for backups like python um
64:50 - there's a whole area that uses like net
64:53 - framework with c sharp so i mean that
64:56 - you know maybe that would be
64:58 - my advice
65:05 - uh md
65:07 - says hello
65:09 - um
65:10 - daily at what time the classes begin and
65:13 - i want to learn from starting how can i
65:15 - learn uh
65:18 - you know what i the
65:20 - i'm assuming you're talking about these
65:21 - live streams
65:23 - you know we've been starting at such
65:25 - weird times so i can't really say it'd
65:27 - be nice if i get back on a normal
65:29 - schedule but right now just too many
65:31 - things are going on that i i can't stick
65:34 - to a certain time so
65:36 - unfortunately there is no set time right
65:38 - now
65:41 - shang xiao says many people use coding
65:42 - as an escape as a way to find another
65:44 - route in their life hope whoever is
65:47 - doing it finds passion and luck along
65:49 - the way
65:52 - yeah that's cool learning how to code
65:54 - definitely has helped a lot of people
65:56 - just
65:56 - you know have a totally different
65:59 - lifestyle
66:01 - a lot of times you know for the better
66:05 - lymbola says i strongly suggest jonas at
66:07 - udemy
66:08 - uh i took
66:10 - many before him and jonas advanced css
66:12 - course is the best that i found thank
66:14 - you so much for that recommendation so
66:16 - jonas has an advanced css course on
66:18 - udemy check that out
66:21 - um richaus says what are the
66:23 - prerequisites for learning react uh
66:25 - javascript for sure i mean html and css
66:28 - and javascript if you know those you're
66:30 - good to learn react siddhar says which
66:33 - languages are you comfortable with and
66:34 - how did you start your journey as a web
66:36 - developer
66:37 - um
66:39 - javascript i'm most comfortable with i
66:41 - know a little php
66:43 - and
66:45 - i've done a little bit with python
66:47 - before with c sharp um
66:50 - java c plus plus like i've done a little
66:53 - bit with a lot of stuff but i'm only
66:54 - really confident with javascript
66:57 - and
66:58 - somewhat
67:00 - maybe confident with php
67:07 - md bubba says please tell me i can
67:09 - contact with you i want to learn
67:12 - um you can find me on like twitter and i
67:15 - think i have a link to my twitter in the
67:17 - in the description
67:19 - uh
67:21 - that i don't really do like courses or
67:23 - anything like that so if you have any
67:24 - questions i'll do my best to help out
67:26 - but you know for right now i don't i'm
67:28 - not doing courses although that might be
67:29 - something that you know i might do at
67:31 - some point
67:33 - [Music]
67:37 - okay emiliano wants to know
67:40 - um what other css framework do i
67:42 - recommend
67:44 - um
67:47 - i mean i i use
67:49 - mostly material ui i like that if i'm
67:52 - not doing react i use materialize css
67:58 - sorry
68:00 - so i haven't really used a lot of other
68:02 - frameworks
68:03 - so i don't know that i can really give
68:05 - any good recommendations outside of
68:06 - those ones
68:08 - um
68:13 - says codeigniter or laravel
68:16 - um as far as i know code igniter is
68:18 - pretty outdated correct me if i'm wrong
68:20 - so i would probably go with laravel if i
68:22 - were you those are both uh for php
68:30 - uh manu says uh
68:32 - what should i learn before react
68:35 - uh javascript css html
68:45 - uh swan says why didn't you use uh
68:48 - serverless tech for your back end cloud
68:50 - functions firebase um
68:53 - yeah we
68:57 - i thought about that
68:59 - but uh you know it's something that i
69:01 - wasn't familiar enough with that i was
69:04 - confident in doing it in a project of
69:05 - this size
69:07 - you know in this this much importance
69:09 - you know
69:10 - um so the way we're doing it now you
69:13 - know it's for the most part we've tested
69:14 - out before so i felt more confident in
69:16 - that
69:17 - um
69:18 - mit says make some series of kali linux
69:22 - tutorial i don't i've never used kali
69:24 - linux so if i end up using it maybe i'll
69:26 - do a series on it
69:31 - julia says hello jesse uh
69:34 - should you use uh saga or redux thunk i
69:38 - have used thunk before i like it i have
69:40 - not used sagas before
69:49 - uh julia says
69:51 - uh
69:53 - what do you think about laravel is it a
69:54 - good to learn yeah if you're gonna learn
69:56 - a php framework i
69:59 - from what my limited knowledge about it
70:01 - i do recommend laravel i've heard good
70:03 - things about it
70:06 - shrey says i'm currently working with
70:08 - asp.net
70:10 - and
70:12 - microsoft sql server
70:14 - is the dotnet framework losing its
70:15 - significance what future do you imagine
70:17 - isn't storefront.net framework
70:19 - i don't really know i mean i'm not a
70:20 - huge fan of.net framework but i see a
70:22 - lot there's a lot of new stuff happening
70:24 - with it um even like microsoft is
70:28 - really kind of changing the way it it
70:31 - interacts with the developer community
70:34 - so
70:35 - you know i think it'll be around for a
70:36 - while just because of microsoft really
70:39 - um
70:40 - and there's so many companies that are
70:42 - already kind of entrenched in the whole
70:44 - net world it's not going anywhere
70:46 - anytime soon
70:47 - so if if it can be
70:49 - i think
70:51 - if the net world can be more integrated
70:53 - with the rest of like the javascript dev
70:55 - world
70:57 - and take advantage a lot of that stuff i
70:59 - i think it has a good shot at you know
71:01 - being relevant and being around you know
71:03 - for a long time
71:08 - so dar says can i get javascript
71:09 - tutorials at free code cam yeah there's
71:11 - a whole course on javascript on the
71:14 - freecodecam.org website but then also we
71:17 - have a ton of video
71:20 - tutorials as well on our youtube channel
71:29 - andrew says hey jesse site looks great i
71:32 - saw on instagram you're looking around
71:33 - for your opportunities i'm sure you'll
71:34 - be picked up in no time oh thank you i
71:37 - appreciate it
71:39 - um
71:44 - a man who asks what's the best procedure
71:46 - for learning react in a pro way online
71:48 - courses
71:50 - um
71:52 - how to turn off my music my headache's
71:54 - getting so terrible
71:56 - um
72:01 - uh so anything else we're doing a
72:04 - project in that but looking into
72:06 - documentation makes that kind of
72:07 - difficult
72:08 - um free codecamp has some react stuff
72:10 - now on freecodecam.org
72:16 - wow
72:17 - i
72:18 - need to like take a nap
72:20 - um yeah so i would check that out
72:23 - there's definitely a lot of good
72:24 - tutorial videos on react out there
72:26 - so that might be a little bit easier
72:29 - than trying to read the documentation
72:46 - says i'm mostly just fixing bugs at work
72:48 - small issues which arise out of changes
72:50 - such additions the code base is this
72:52 - what developers do in the us yeah but it
72:54 - depends some developers main job is
72:56 - fixing bugs maintenance other developers
72:59 - build new stuff
73:01 - and don't handle you know live you know
73:03 - products so
73:04 - it just kind of depends
73:12 - juggernaut says jesse if you could
73:14 - choose where you want to go what's your
73:15 - dream
73:18 - don't even know um
73:22 - i don't know i have to think about that
73:24 - uh
73:27 - yeah i guess it is like
73:29 - there's different parts to that so it's
73:31 - like right now like i always got to
73:32 - think about like my fame my wife and
73:34 - family you know it's not just like where
73:36 - do i want to go that would be awesome
73:38 - it's you know where could i go that
73:39 - would be the best for my kids that would
73:41 - have good schools and things like that
73:43 - so it's kind of a complicated question
73:46 - uh because i have to think about all
73:47 - those things so
73:49 - um yeah so i'm not exactly exactly sure
73:52 - i mean in terms of work though
73:54 - um
73:56 - i love working on cutting edge stuff
74:00 - and i i love working on things that
74:04 - that would actually help people
74:12 - um siddhartha says i'm learning
74:13 - javascript but i don't know where to
74:15 - implement that i mean i want to work on
74:16 - some projects um from where should i get
74:19 - one
74:20 - yep check out the free code camp
74:23 - curriculum because they'll have a lot of
74:24 - sample projects where you'll be able to
74:26 - use javascript on
74:29 - i would recommend that
74:30 - that's a good place to start
74:33 - uh is it would still be useful to learn
74:35 - jquery in 2018 um yeah you know what
74:38 - there's still a lot of companies that
74:40 - use jquery for their website so
74:42 - knowing jquery is still good
74:45 - um
74:46 - going forward i expect probably the use
74:48 - of jquery will go down because there are
74:50 - other things taking its place
74:53 - so i don't know what the outlook is like
74:54 - for the future but
74:58 - a lot of companies
75:00 - depending on how big they are and what
75:01 - the industry is like are very very slow
75:03 - to change things
75:05 - so there's still going to be jquery jobs
75:07 - around for a long time just because of
75:10 - that
75:15 - um mit says
75:18 - what should i do so that people know me
75:22 - hmm really sorry i just can't quit
75:25 - yawning so people know me in the it
75:27 - field
75:29 - this is what happens when you try to
75:30 - give up caffeine i guess
75:34 - yeah get involved um online like i mean
75:38 - as a developer like twitter is a huge
75:41 - thing so i don't know if it's the same
75:43 - with it stuff but yeah like get involved
75:46 - on twitter you know follow the people
75:48 - that are the like leaders in your field
75:51 - uh you know like retweet their stuff try
75:53 - to interact
75:55 - um
75:56 - that's probably that's a really good you
75:57 - know good way to go if you can like
75:59 - write articles like tutorials
76:02 - or you know do videos like i don't
76:04 - really write that much but i like to do
76:06 - the videos
76:08 - um
76:09 - you know volunteer to help people go to
76:11 - conferences uh when you go to
76:14 - conferences make sure you talk to as
76:15 - many people as you can
76:17 - so all those things will will help
76:22 - marlin says have you ever noticed
76:24 - jankiness when your background loads for
76:26 - the first time with react i get no lag
76:28 - when using the image tag but when i
76:30 - switch to background image it takes
76:31 - about two seconds to load yeah sometimes
76:34 - when you use background image you can
76:36 - have a little bit of jank so
76:37 - um
76:38 - try not to use it hold on let's say this
76:43 - hey
76:46 - all right thank you
76:51 - cool i just got handed a like a print
76:54 - brochure thing and
76:56 - so i can check it out see if i want to
76:57 - use any photos for the website and then
77:00 - they will get me the photos so that's
77:02 - kind of cool
77:04 - so my team here is very helpful like the
77:06 - other people in in this department um
77:09 - are super helpful
77:11 - uh
77:12 - sorry i was right in the middle i think
77:14 - oh the jankiness with the background
77:15 - image yeah so using a css background
77:17 - image uh definitely takes
77:21 - it
77:22 - it stresses out the browser more than
77:24 - using an image tag so you want to be
77:25 - careful with that
77:27 - don't use it like a bunch on one page
77:30 - try to make sure your image is optimized
77:33 - and if you have a ton of stuff going on
77:35 - on a page you maybe don't want to use it
77:39 - trying to do
77:41 - like parallax things like we're doing
77:43 - here
77:44 - right with our um
77:46 - i don't even remember what it's called
77:48 - in css now
77:51 - it's a property when you use a
77:52 - background image that that makes it do
77:54 - that so that can also cause some trouble
77:57 - so if you disable that
77:59 - you'll you'll have a much better time of
78:00 - it so
78:01 - if you notice let's say like that the
78:04 - image isn't showing up first it could be
78:06 - that like maybe you want to take that
78:08 - css
78:10 - and load it sooner right so if you have
78:12 - the css for that in a css file and it's
78:15 - waiting its turn to get loaded
78:18 - then
78:19 - it's going to take a while so what you
78:20 - can do
78:21 - you can make that background css be
78:23 - inline in the html and it'll load
78:27 - a lot more quickly
78:30 - or
78:30 - if you don't want to put it like right
78:32 - in the html tag you could just take it
78:34 - and put a style tag at the head
78:37 - of your document and put that above all
78:39 - the other things that you you want to
78:41 - load like all your files you're bringing
78:43 - in
78:43 - and that's kind of like a little trick
78:45 - to use for
78:46 - the stuff that's like users will see
78:49 - immediately
78:50 - i mean and then of course like the image
78:51 - size itself will definitely have an
78:53 - impact on how fast it loads too
79:03 - emiliano's coffee coffee coffee
79:06 - um
79:07 - trey says how is work like for trainee
79:09 - software developers in the us who are
79:11 - straight out of college in the first six
79:12 - months i honestly have no idea because
79:14 - that's not the route i went so i i've
79:16 - never
79:17 - i i've never seen it
79:26 - oh okay so
79:27 - uh i got a pronunciation here so wa wah
79:30 - weiru
79:32 - let me know if that's the right
79:33 - pronunciation thank you so much for for
79:35 - letting me know how to pronounce that
79:37 - um jesse says or
79:39 - andrew says jesse do companies use
79:41 - create react app in production
79:44 - i'm not sh
79:45 - i'm not sure i mean it's it's pretty
79:47 - commonly used
79:52 - but i couldn't tell you right now like
79:54 - of a specific company that does use it
79:56 - so i mean i
79:58 - i don't know i imagine yes but i
80:00 - definitely have to look that up i
80:02 - wouldn't want to say for sure without
80:04 - without checking
80:06 - uh siddhar says how's o'reilly's
80:08 - javascript book for learning javascript
80:11 - i want to have a handbook kind of thing
80:13 - for html css so that i can memorize them
80:16 - i don't know i haven't checked out that
80:18 - book so
80:19 - uh there are some good there's a
80:20 - javascript book called eloquent
80:22 - javascript that's really good and then
80:24 - there's a book series called you don't
80:26 - know js that also is very good so
80:29 - they're available online but you you can
80:31 - get them in print as well so check those
80:34 - out
80:35 - uh siddharth says what can i do to
80:36 - memorize html and css3 tags and
80:38 - attributes just use them
80:40 - right i've never attempted to memorize
80:42 - them like just use them
80:44 - and if you code every day with them you
80:47 - will remember them
80:48 - uh so that's i think is the the best way
80:51 - to go about memorization right because
80:54 - just look them up
80:56 - and you will remember them right
81:00 - the annoyance of having to look them up
81:02 - will force you to memorize them right
81:05 - it's so much better to do it that way
81:07 - than to try to like sit down and read a
81:09 - list of them right you may as well be
81:11 - actually getting coding done
81:13 - while you're memorizing
81:14 - hopefully that that makes sense
81:17 - it's just like the best way to learn a
81:18 - language is to actually speak it be
81:20 - immersed in it
81:22 - you know like a spoken language i think
81:24 - that's the same way with a
81:26 - computer language right just
81:29 - [Music]
81:30 - just use it
81:31 - and
81:32 - look up what you need to until you don't
81:34 - need to look it up anymore
81:37 - java oracle python which one
81:40 - do i have to learn uh for a job you can
81:42 - get a job with any of them it just
81:43 - depends on what you want to do
81:45 - so just figure out what you want to do
81:47 - and then do a little bit of research on
81:49 - what companies are using what language
81:52 - right and and then you know do a search
81:56 - see what how many jobs there are for
81:58 - that and that should kind of tell you
82:00 - phoenix says are you wearing red pants
82:02 - yeah i'm wearing red pants so
82:04 - i don't know if
82:05 - you can see
82:07 - i'm wearing yeah i'm wearing red pants
82:10 - so
82:17 - yeah
82:19 - they are
82:21 - if anybody is interested in wearing the
82:23 - same red pants as me you can find them
82:26 - they're bonobos is the brand and they're
82:28 - bonobos uh chinos i don't know what
82:31 - exactly the
82:33 - color isn't called or anything like that
82:35 - but
82:36 - they're nice pants they fit well
82:46 - uh andrew said oh andrew was talking to
82:49 - somebody else um juggernaut says jesse
82:52 - uh you want to continue web development
82:54 - or you're looking for other endeavors
82:55 - like systems games etc
82:57 - i'm thinking i'll probably just continue
82:59 - with like react development because
83:01 - that's most likely what i'll be able to
83:03 - get a job in but i'd definitely be open
83:05 - to other things like
83:07 - game development sounds fun uh anything
83:09 - that has to do with some like newer
83:12 - stuff uh like machine learning
83:15 - uh sounds really cool
83:17 - um
83:18 - you know like uh vr or ar sounds awesome
83:22 - to work with so i'm open to new
83:24 - opportunities i just am not sure that i
83:28 - have the skill set to get hired in those
83:30 - positions right now
83:37 - uh md baba says i want to learn machine
83:39 - learning how can i learn
83:40 - um try out
83:43 - udacity has some machine learning
83:44 - courses i think they have some free ones
83:47 - so see try those out
83:49 - because i i think they're pretty good
83:51 - and see if you like it if you really
83:53 - like it and you want to do their paid
83:54 - courses then those are available too
83:58 - julia says well i have to
84:00 - to know object oriented php in order to
84:02 - start learning laravel i don't know i
84:04 - don't know enough about laravel so
84:06 - sorry
84:08 - uh par says what is your view on google
84:10 - versus oracle um
84:14 - if you mean like the whole lawsuit that
84:16 - was going on between them i i think it's
84:20 - i side with google in that lawsuit so
84:22 - basically like google was using so
84:25 - oracle owns the language java google was
84:28 - using java in android's operating system
84:32 - and oracle sued them
84:34 - um claiming that
84:36 - i think like google owed them a bunch of
84:38 - money for using java when because they
84:40 - own java so it's kind of ridiculous like
84:44 - if we start saying that companies can
84:46 - own programming languages
84:48 - that's just crazy right it to me like if
84:50 - that's how oracle oracle is going to do
84:52 - this
84:53 - then
84:55 - you know people aren't going to use it
84:56 - anymore right it's so
84:59 - that's like probably an
85:00 - oversimplification of what's happening
85:02 - and i could be wrong so if i'm wrong
85:04 - correct me please but
85:05 - um
85:07 - i just think it sets a bad standard if
85:09 - you're going to allow
85:11 - oracle to
85:13 - kind of win that that case
85:17 - um
85:19 - manuswar says hi what are the languages
85:22 - i should go for if i want to become an
85:24 - ethical hacker as well as get into
85:26 - android development
85:27 - um
85:28 - java or or kotlin for android
85:31 - development and as a hacker like i mean
85:33 - you you just need whatever you're trying
85:35 - to hack you need to know how that works
85:38 - so
85:40 - um
85:40 - you would i would assume i'm i'm not a
85:43 - hacker so
85:44 - this is assumption so you know
85:47 - don't take it as the way to go
85:49 - but i would assume you would need to
85:50 - have more of a general knowledge of a
85:52 - lot of systems uh and then you would
85:54 - need to like seriously do your homework
85:56 - on
85:57 - the particular system you're about to
85:59 - hack
86:01 - uh siddharth says is there any direct
86:03 - use of c language and web development in
86:06 - web development not that i know of i've
86:08 - never come across it but it you know
86:10 - could be out there
86:11 - um what about c sharp
86:14 - yeah c sharp is used in like dot net
86:16 - framework stuff so i have come across
86:18 - that in for the back end in web
86:20 - development limbala says have you used
86:23 - react native and what do you think about
86:25 - it as
86:26 - uh as a newbie learning react i'm not
86:29 - sure if i should focus on progressive
86:30 - web apps with react or react native you
86:33 - learn react first unless for some reason
86:35 - you really need to make a mobile app
86:37 - um
86:38 - i like react native i i really like
86:42 - like building things with react native
86:43 - and i i hope that i can do more with it
86:45 - in the future so
86:47 - but
86:48 - i think if you're coming from
86:50 - knowing html and css and javascript
86:54 - trying to get into the react world it's
86:56 - an easier jump to learn
86:58 - regular react first than to go into
87:00 - react native because there's a few
87:02 - extra kind of things you have to think
87:04 - about when you're building for
87:06 - um
87:07 - for a mobile phone right to building an
87:10 - uh mobile app right so it
87:13 - it's a little bit easier
87:15 - uh if you're still doing things to the
87:17 - web
87:18 - and a lot of what you learn in react
87:20 - will help you to learn react native
87:26 - yeah uh lymbala says i'm focusing on
87:28 - mobile apps or small businesses yeah if
87:30 - you're focusing on mobile apps then then
87:32 - learn react native first because that's
87:34 - what you'll need
87:36 - i know progressive web apps can be
87:38 - downloaded on the home screen but a lot
87:40 - of people just don't get that yet
87:43 - and don't realize that that's a thing so
87:46 - probably you're going to have a better
87:48 - time of it
87:50 - and a better time selling your services
87:52 - to small businesses if you use a mobile
87:55 - app
87:59 - um
88:01 - so ron says can i go for the react
88:03 - without the node.js yeah for sure you
88:05 - don't have to use node.js for react
88:09 - great can be used with any type of
88:10 - backend
88:18 - we have another react versus angular
88:20 - question
88:21 - uh so
88:22 - i'm just gonna say it it just depends on
88:25 - your project there's there's no
88:27 - there's no quick answer for react versus
88:29 - angular
88:32 - marlon says thanks for the help jesse
88:34 - gonna try sorting this background jank
88:36 - out by the way how do you personally go
88:37 - about styling and react style components
88:40 - um i have used style components before
88:42 - but normally um just use like css and js
88:47 - sometimes i use normal style sheets
88:49 - sometimes i just do inline styles i do a
88:51 - variety of things i haven't decided on
88:54 - what i really like want to stick with
88:56 - yet
88:58 - siddhar says uh what are the steps to
89:00 - become a full stack web developer um you
89:03 - could either start with the front or the
89:04 - back end i started with front end so
89:06 - i'll go over that
89:08 - html javascript css
89:10 - um after that then
89:13 - then you start to learn more about
89:15 - back-end stuff so if you already know
89:17 - javascript i recommend going with node
89:20 - learn about a little bit about node how
89:22 - to set up
89:23 - uh you know your your server your your
89:26 - basic routing maybe do like some
89:29 - handling of form data emails things like
89:31 - that
89:32 - in node
89:34 - um learn about apis how to build apis
89:37 - how to use apis like
89:39 - you know and and branch out from there
89:41 - right and i mean that's just the
89:43 - javascript ecosystem so there's a whole
89:45 - lot of other stuff if you want to get
89:46 - into other languages
89:51 - and i'm sure i mean i'm probably i'm
89:52 - leaving out a lot of stuff right so but
89:54 - that's just the basic
89:56 - route you take
89:58 - uh limbala says thanks so much for these
90:00 - uh so useful answers i will be checking
90:02 - out your 200 other videos here
90:05 - yeah
90:06 - if anybody ever manages to watch all of
90:08 - my videos please let me know because
90:10 - that would be i mean i've been around
90:12 - for all of them
90:13 - but
90:15 - that's a lot of content right
90:20 - in apologies because i'm sure i probably
90:21 - have some like weird annoying things
90:23 - that i do and and having to suffer
90:25 - through all those uh
90:28 - probably not the best
90:30 - um
90:32 - but balaji says is there any way to
90:35 - improve the speed access of websites
90:37 - much faster than regular scripts
90:39 - languages
90:40 - uh yeah there's there's definitely a lot
90:42 - you can do um
90:44 - you know one of the biggest things that
90:46 - i always do going in if people want me
90:48 - to improve speed is check the image
90:49 - sizes so many times it's that images are
90:52 - way too large
90:54 - you know they're only showing a tiny
90:55 - image but in reality the file is
90:57 - actually huge
90:59 - image compression
91:01 - could be even like you know what's being
91:03 - loaded and when is it being loaded
91:06 - um
91:07 - sometimes websites will have all this
91:08 - tracking stuff so you got your analytics
91:10 - and then you got your social media
91:12 - things that come in and they said way
91:14 - too much going on and don't realize how
91:16 - much it's it's impacting
91:19 - uh their site right if you use like some
91:21 - third-party things sometimes they're
91:23 - bringing in whole libraries like and you
91:25 - don't even realize like other versions
91:27 - of jquery and stuff just to do one tiny
91:29 - little thing
91:30 - so like all of those things can can
91:32 - definitely help out with speed you can
91:34 - set up like a cdn
91:36 - and that'll help the speed so
91:39 - there's a lot of uh quick things you can
91:41 - do that don't really take that much time
91:43 - but can have a huge impact on your site
91:45 - speed
91:48 - i think i did a video once where we try
91:50 - to take an old site and make it faster
91:53 - or like a couple of videos
91:56 - it may it'll be one of my early videos
91:58 - on free code camp or it may be one of my
92:00 - videos i did on my own channel uh before
92:02 - i started doing free code camp so i
92:04 - think there's a link to my channel in
92:05 - the description if you want to try to
92:06 - find it
92:08 - um
92:09 - i do have some some videos on there as
92:11 - well
92:16 - uh s
92:18 - sumits
92:23 - says what do you think about reason ml
92:25 - and reason reacts
92:27 - uh
92:28 - reason seems really cool when i went to
92:29 - react rally ken wheeler gave a talk
92:32 - about reason and that was the first time
92:34 - i really like learned anything about
92:36 - reason other than just hearing it
92:38 - and it seems really awesome
92:40 - i don't know enough about it to really
92:42 - give a good explanation of it um but
92:46 - it's something that
92:48 - i would be open to using
92:50 - in the future and i think it could help
92:51 - me write like better better code
92:54 - so
92:57 - i'm definitely
92:58 - i'm i'm a fan of it but a very new fan
93:04 - uh
93:05 - saran says do web development does web
93:07 - development involve algorithms and data
93:09 - structure in javascript
93:11 - not really a lot i mean
93:13 - algorithms and stuff like that you need
93:16 - to know for job interviews right
93:18 - but in reality like you don't use them
93:22 - very much at all in day-to-day web
93:24 - development so
93:27 - if you're not great with them don't
93:28 - worry you can still be a good web
93:30 - developer without being great at
93:31 - algorithms
93:34 - siddhar says thanks a lot for your for
93:36 - the answers going to watch your
93:38 - javascript tutorials awesome yeah and
93:40 - check out like on this on this channel
93:42 - uh beau carnes does a ton of javascript
93:44 - tutorials that are awesome
93:46 - uh constantine says hey jesse how long
93:50 - did it take you to become a front end
93:51 - atlanta first shot so i was a freelancer
93:54 - for a while so maybe like three years
93:57 - before i got this full-time job so like
93:59 - during that time it's not like i was
94:00 - always looking for jobs i was
94:02 - freelancing right so um
94:06 - but
94:07 - like i learned more and more as time
94:09 - progressed and i picked up more clients
94:11 - and try to do more challenging jobs
94:14 - so it was like a three year period of me
94:16 - slowly picking up new things but working
94:19 - while i was doing it getting basically
94:20 - getting paid to learn
94:23 - so i don't think it would always take it
94:25 - certainly wouldn't take three years
94:28 - for most people but because i was
94:30 - freelancing while i was doing it i
94:31 - wasn't really like
94:33 - actively looking for for full-time um
94:37 - like a full-time developer position
94:42 - siddhar says keep teaching us and uh
94:45 - balaji says thanks for your knowledge it
94:47 - is so useful
94:48 - oh i i appreciate you saying this
94:51 - um
94:52 - every says hi jesse just watch the first
94:54 - 10 minutes of the streaming i'm really
94:56 - sorry for what happened to you uh
94:58 - hashtag we are with you thank you so
95:00 - much i appreciate that
95:02 - um
95:03 - make tutorials on operating system
95:05 - programming it's hard to learn
95:07 - yeah i don't know anything about that so
95:09 - i can only make a tutorial on things i
95:11 - know about
95:12 - um
95:14 - soran says thanks for guiding us through
95:16 - live videos and always up to
95:18 - uh live with jesse
95:20 - uh
95:21 - nami says hello jesse you're a great
95:23 - teacher and i've learned a lot but still
95:26 - lost i need help with javascript and
95:28 - learning the codes
95:30 - and let me know i'm um i'm about to end
95:33 - the stream now but
95:34 - mammy you know get a hold of me on
95:37 - twitter or something you can always ask
95:38 - me a question on there as well
95:43 - man as far as how to get started in
95:44 - android development
95:46 - uh you could if you want to just do
95:48 - android and you don't want to do like
95:49 - react native um then you know try to
95:52 - find some android tutorials you're
95:54 - probably gonna end up using java or
95:56 - kotlin for that
95:59 - siddharth says what is franciscan uh
96:01 - franciscan if university of steubenville
96:04 - is the college that i currently work for
96:08 - uh saron says do you have experience
96:09 - with machine learning with javascript
96:11 - very very little experience like i've
96:13 - done some tutorials and watched videos
96:15 - on using brain js and tensorflow
96:18 - um js
96:20 - so i i have some ideas for stuff i want
96:22 - to build but i just haven't built
96:24 - anything yet
96:28 - uh ahmad says afternoon javascript which
96:30 - framework do you prefer reactor angular
96:32 - i prefer react but i don't have a
96:34 - problem with angular i just i just work
96:36 - with react
96:37 - so
96:38 - all right i'm going to end things now
96:40 - i've been streaming for a while and
96:44 - i think
96:46 - i've gotten so many messages i keep
96:48 - seeing my phone going off so i'm going
96:50 - to check these and hopefully if there's
96:52 - nothing like major that i need to do at
96:54 - work i'm going to i'm going to head home
96:56 - for the day and uh and relax a little
96:58 - bit
97:01 - tadar says you made the franciscan
97:03 - website yes i did so the website you see
97:05 - back here this is what we made um
97:08 - in live stream the whole process
97:14 - all right so i see a few more things
97:16 - coming up but i'm gonna
97:18 - i'm gonna have to cut the stream off it
97:20 - there's so many great questions i i
97:21 - really enjoy this but this this could
97:23 - probably keep going forever um but i i
97:26 - love all the questions i love all like
97:28 - the
97:29 - the interest and everything and i'm
97:32 - gonna try to do another stream you know
97:33 - when i can
97:35 - and uh hopefully after i do my react
97:37 - training next week i'll have a ton of
97:39 - new stuff to share with you about react
97:41 - so i'm super excited about that and i'll
97:43 - definitely let you know all the cool
97:44 - stuff that i learned
97:46 - if anybody happens to be in the dc area
97:48 - specifically in like um tyson's corner
97:52 - virginia around there uh let me know
97:55 - you know maybe we can hang out next week
97:57 - or something
97:58 - um
97:59 - and uh yeah so until next time have a
98:01 - wonderful day
98:03 - and
98:04 - thanks again

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today i want to do a recap of the project that we just launched and go over like how we did it the decisions that we made why we made them uh and then talk a little bit about the the next steps uh for for what's gonna happen i also have some nice analytics to share with you just about you know how well the site's doing and um so we're not really gonna do a lot of coding right now um it's gonna be more like just kind of overview also um you know feel free to ask questions uh definitely open to questions and also i want to give you a little update on like my situation uh for work and everything because there's gonna be some changes coming up uh so that's the plan for today uh sorry for the short notice on the stream too i i was just really busy and didn't um i wanted to stream but i didn't get it scheduled early enough so there maybe had been some issues with notifications not being received um but hopefully looks like you know there's a lot of you in the in the stream so i'm hoping that everything works with the notifications okay so first uh let me explain uh some of the the changes right i don't want to leave anybody in suspense right so uh i am most likely uh going to be leaving my position right now uh at the university and finding employment somewhere else so if you follow me on social media you probably already know this uh i've i've received already uh thankfully us a lot of uh not not direct offers but a lot of invitations to apply uh to places and offers from people to um to recommend me so i'm very grateful for that and thank you so much to everyone who who retweeted my tweet or shared it on on instagram or on linkedin uh thank you so much for that uh the the response and the reach that that got is just amazing and um i like i'm very very grateful thank you thank you so much for that so uh i don't know where i'll be at and i'm not sure how quickly i'll be i'll be leaving here so for now um i i guess i'll still be working on this project and i'm still gonna do my stream so i'm gonna i'm gonna keep doing my stream and then depending on what position i get we'll just have to see i'd love to keep doing the stream it may be that i won't be able to stream my everyday work but i'll have to stream the side project and it may be you know maybe the stream has to has to move to like a saturday or maybe it's going to be in the evenings instead of in the morning so um so there are probably going to be some changes to the stream but not just yet out um i'll still be streaming although uh next week i may not be able to stream that much because i will be at uh react training in washington dc so i'm excited about that to learn some new stuff um so just to give you a little heads up too about why why this is happening um so as you all most of you know who have watched the stream this project we've been working on since january has launched it would launch like two to three weeks ago but if you go to the website now if you go to the url you'll see the old website so uh unfortunately is somebody higher up in the organization for some reason unknown to me didn't like the website and instructed the it department to change it back to the old website and this was all without consulting me so at this point i don't know what the problem was i have some guesses but that's just based on stuff i've heard from other people so i don't know why the site was taken down i've gotten no attempt to contact me to explain anything or to ask me to change anything as we'll see in a second the site was definitely meeting the requirements and surpassing them it was based on the analytics it was already hitting our goals for what we wanted the site to do and as far this this person that made the call didn't even look at the analytics um i from from everything i understand about it the call was made without without that so um and this person's actually somewhat new to the organization and hasn't even been involved in the process so this is pretty like kind of disturbing to me um and so i mean that was okay that was definitely a hit to the ego but what really pushed me over the edge is just the way it all happened uh from what i understand um you know the people who did actually get to talk to this person uh say he was he was not very nice about the whole thing um treated treated people in a way that no one should be treated right so given that i just don't feel comfortable being around if you know one of the main people in charge is is treating people like that um so what i'll do is i'm going to try to make sure that people know about it um hopefully somebody will do something about it but you know at the end of the day it's it's not an environment that i want to be in so while i'm still here i'm going to do whatever i can to try to make it better for the people that are staying um but then i you know i gotta get out it's uh so like you know personally you know i struggle with depression anxiety and things so i'm i was just been not feeling very good the last couple of days i'm pretty calm now i actually have a really bad headache so when i get anxiety usually that caffeine makes it worse so i totally cut caffeine out yesterday and i've been getting these headaches i think maybe i was drinking too much caffeine and now i'm going through withdrawal so my head hurts so bad right now but i know based on my past experience situations like this could make me have a panic attack so i don't want to chance that so i'm just trying to be as as calm as i can and just keep doing what i'm doing you know talking to people uh about new job opportunities and you know thinking about okay how do i want to work my resume you know i'm thinking about maybe redoing my personal website since i haven't touched it in years uh you know been talking with my wife about what we want to do and been thinking about ways to just address the situation in the most professional way possible without the way i see there are several options like i could freak out and be very unprofessional about this or i could just try to hide and i don't want to do either right i don't want to hide because i don't want this to happen to other people in the organization and i don't want to freak out because that'll probably make things worse so i'm trying to find a middle ground to get the word out in a very logical way um to the people that need to know um and and make a good case uh for for not only this site but for um you know for making sure that people are treated with respect uh so yeah so i um anyway and i it's it was just one person right so this is not like a huge organizational thing um you know i generally over my three years here you know 99 of people have been very friendly you know just even over the top like beyond what you'd expect people to be so this is a new individual here unfortunately they have a lot of authority so i don't i don't really know this person i haven't even gotten a chance to know them so i'm not i'm not even sure what to think about it you know um other than it shouldn't it shouldn't no one should ever treat another person like that okay so let's get on to the site is some happier stuff i'm actually still like i'm really proud of this site despite what this other person may think like objectively speaking we did a good job with this site uh the the technology is sound it's you know somewhat cutting edge um i think uh we accomplished what our goals were right so if someone wanted to disagree with what the goals were in the first place you know that's understandable they could do that but in terms of does this website meet the goals does it does it me does it fulfill the requirements of the project i think most definitely it does um so let's check out the analytics first and let me give you if you're not sure what website i'm talking about this is the one that we built i still have it up at a um at a test link that i had running anyway so i never took down the tesling and uh i just want to say hi i see a lot of activity in the chat so let me um let me switch up to this screen you can see it for a second and i just want to say hello to everyone um so hey um i see there are some questions i'll get to some of the the more like technical questions in a second but i want to answer any questions that have to do with what we just talked about first um carl asked if i'd still on my live stream no matter what i do want to try as hard as i can to keep doing this live stream as long as you all think that it's valuable to you and to the community i will i want to keep doing it yeah steven says so no feedback no mockup changes what the heck yeah i mean that's it's it's a it's an unprecedented situation i've never had this happen before you know uh for someone to be dissatisfied with with your work but then give absolutely no feedback um mario says thank you for being open and saying uh as it is you you're welcome i yeah i mean i just especially for you all that have been with me here through this project for so long i i want you all to know what's really going on you know um when i say this even though this is live and anybody could watch it like it doesn't feel like i'm just announcing this to the public right like we've all been together many of us for you know well over a year working on projects you know so you're you know we have a community here you know we have a team here so you all deserve to know why the work that you some of you have actually contributed code and many of you contributed ideas so this is all very much our work why it's not there anymore and it says that person acts very mature we are supporting you in your decision thank you thank you so much i appreciate it okay all right so let's let's check out then um some of the analytics and then maybe um we'll see what it looks like in terms of questions in there maybe go over some stuff so i'm gonna make this as big as i can but here's the analytics that i i was impressed i was honestly surprised at how good some of these numbers were i mean i know it's one thing to to have an idea and a plan and and no you know have a good idea that it will work and it's another thing to actually see the results so i'm gonna go over these really quick uh especially for those of you who are just listening and can't read this i took the analytics and i actually removed steubenville the city that the university is in from the results right because that uh the target audience is not people already on campus and most of our students don't actually come from steubenville so we remove stevenville completely so i compared uh the same time period in 2017 to the time period the website was live because we're trying to track like applications and that's very cyclical so the only way to be fair about it is the same time period in in that same year right so we had 67 decrease in page load times right which was expected right we knew it was going to be a lot faster home page even greater decrease uh the next number i think is really important so we're targeting prospective students right we want them to come to our website want them to apply to learn more about this university so google analytics doesn't let you it doesn't show you data specifically about people under 25 but you can tell because if you just take the total number of visits minus all the visits from the age groups they do give you data from which starts at 25 and goes up to however high somebody can live to then we can get a better idea of okay well the group that's left over is younger than 25 they are most likely majority made up of people who um are in that group that age group of our target audience so anyway we have a 48 increase in people visiting our site from that from that age group which is great uh because that's what we were we had in mind the entire time uh we had an increase in visits to the application uh of seven percent increase which is a really nice a nice increase i need to get the data on the inquiry form too i forgot to do that but that's also an important form that we're trying to drive people to um we actually had a big increase in the time spent on the home page which is interesting because the old homepage was huge it took very long a long time to load partly because there's so much content i mean very small text images videos everywhere and you could scroll for three days through it it was long you can see it now at the main website it you know the old website is back online now but the interesting thing is we got rid of all that and had a very minimal simplistic home page and we had an increase of people's of the time spent on the home page by 48 and you know from just looking at that face value kind of trying to figure out why you know i think the busyness of the old homepage was a turn off it was overwhelming and when we actually broke it down and only showed people some very important facts they they stayed and they read those so there may be other ways to interpret that but that seems like a pretty good way um to kind of view that statistic to me and it's almost counterintuitive right we we gave them less content and then they ended up spending more time on the page um also i'm not going to go through every department but you like one of the big things we wanted to do is show that we have good academic programs here where we are a catholic school and we have a wellknown reputation for being catholic so based on our market research we already know that that people don't doubt that but what people doubt is our academics they don't know if we're actually good academically so there are students that would like to come here because they're catholic students and they they want to be here but they're not sure they'll get a good education here so what we were trying to do is appeal to those students by showcasing our academic programs right on the home page and you know we succeeded in bringing in more people so you could see the masters in theology had a bit of an increase some of these like theology program had a 275 percent increase in traffic to that page so you can see just some of the other programs here um some really big numbers here uh huge increases so you know based on these analytics i think we definitely succeeded in in our goals uh for this website right and and this was just really the first phase i mean you all know there are so many ideas for what we wanted to do that are going to come later on or were going to come later on probably not now um so really this is comparing a site that had already gone through a whole year development from an old agency working on it and talking about the old site and then years of development after that comparing it to a site that just came out and you know basically we've done just kind of me and you all have done for less than a year launched it and had very little time to make any improvements and we still had these kind of numbers i mean i to me i think that's that's very impressive i'm proud of it i think you all should be proud of it because you're a big part of it so no matter what happens with this site um this is a successful site and the data shows it um you you can't you can't argue the the numbers um so anyway i wanted to share that with you because i think that's it's just so impressive and um you know all the thought that we put into this site and uh you know everything uh it it paid off okay let me i guess i don't need to show anything right now let's just put this in the background because we're just gonna talk about stuff for a little bit so uh i'm going to take a little bit of time right now to answer some of the questions that you have and then we're going to dive into some of the technology just to refresh your mind in case you haven't been watching these streams this was built with react with next js we're using apollo graphql we use node wordpress for the content management system with a wp graphql plugin we have algolia now for search which i did finish and implemented so you can try out the search now it's way faster we're using google cloud platform to host most of this cloud sql um and what do we have cloud sql the the cloud storage bucket uh and we're using app engine to host the react app we're using digitalocean uh for the wordpress application or the wordpress installation so all those technologies went into this so if you have questions about any of those technologies why we use them or anything feel free to put them in there now i can go into a lot more detail about it hey harshit's here uh and we'll only be around here for a few minutes says now all we need is a good svg loader for the loading screen yeah for sure i am i thought about that the other night um you know sometimes you just think about a project at nighttime you're not even working on it it just occurred to me like we still have the words loading come up when you're looking like we never actually put a real loader in there and we did on the on the search page so i thought well at the very least we can just grab what we did on the search page and then put that in for the loader on all the other pages in place of the words loading so that'll probably be on the list but once again i don't really know how much more work i'll be doing on this unfortunately because you know we still had a lot of good things that could have been done so let me i'm going to scroll up and answer some questions here uh sedek said is it possible to build a kickstarter clone with react.js oh most definitely yeah uh you can definitely do that in react um i i think probably any site on the internet could be redone in in react because it's it's javascript in html and css which is what everything's built out of um it doesn't even matter what the back end is really so you could you could remake really anything you know any ui you know whatever and react components romani says how to make a big web app with react um i mean if you're going to make something a big one it's i you can definitely do it with react i would just if it's going to be really large structure is important um so in that case i would most definitely think about reusability of your components so like your actual code base can remain small and easy to work with uh sometimes in smaller projects and i know we've done it and we've done it in this project sometimes is we'll say ah you know what we could really refactor this and reuse it but let's just get this done quick and do it and then you may or may not ever go back and redo that now if the project starts to grow and grow and grow that could really make things difficult to navigate and your project could just balloon and your code base gets huge so i would be more care if you know right above the bat it's gonna be a very big project then you should be more careful about um things like that like how are you gonna handle that structure and things like that and make sure that that's all planned out so that you don't have those moments where you just say ah you know we could do it like this but it'll be faster to do this you know it you can get away with that when it's not that large but you on a large application it could down the road uh not be good for you so if you have any that's kind of really like a large topic so you have any specific questions you know please let me know uh diy coder says the work is really good appreciate this hard work but using react for making website is this overkill or is this the way to do it uh yeah i mean you could say this is overkill we definitely you know we could have built this website using something else right uh you could i would say this though like i would i have no idea how i would have worked out all the routing for this if we were doing this in let's say just plain javascript and i had to do like i don't know i used like jquery for my to do custom routing it would have been insane it's already insane using you know react uh state management would have been a huge problem so uh this website in particular we had so much content coming over like it let's just say for instance i try to do it in wordpress that also would have been a huge thing uh in terms of making sure all the urls work right it would have been it i think it would have been very challenging and difficult to do this in in other in other ways so in this particular case even though it's just a website being able to use react in the whole react ecosystem helped me a lot but you're right normally for a website react is potentially overkill although to be honest with you if you use create react app to start up a website really quickly um it's it's really easy to build out a site with react um you know potentially even easier than if you were to just do a straight html css than other javascript site okay now it depends like if you're not used to react of course react is going to be really difficult but you know it's it's so the barrier to entry for react is so low now and that's a good thing uh that you know it it doesn't feel like overkill right to build anything in react so um yeah so i would yeah i would say for a regular website it potentially could be overkill but it's not like it's not the end of the world right if you're gonna um uh do something in uh and react at least that's that's the way i feel right it's um it all depends on your project what the resources are how much time you're going to take and what your level of ability is with it right then i'm sorry if i'm not as with it as i normally am it's just my headache is i try to take some painkillers my headache is not getting better at all uh limbaugh says i'm new here thanks in advance for sharing i'm in need of inspiration to study on oh well thank you so much for watching and welcome and um yeah for inspiration i would just say i want to say like keep at it keep getting better every day you'll be amazed at how far you've come in a month you know in in a year you'll look back and it it'll be it'll be like wow i you know like i i couldn't do i couldn't even think about doing what i'm doing now a year ago you know you you'll hit that moment and it feels really good all right and oops says which is better angular or react it definitely def oh um someone wants the old website link i'm gonna type it in right now okay so the old website which is now live in place of this one i just linked here uh so you can check out the old website it may take a while to load all right okay so the question was angular vs react it all depends on your situation on your project uh on what you're good with you can build really awesome things or really terrible things with either one so the the way to go is just look at the strengths and weaknesses of react and angular and look at what you need to do for your project and the strengths and weaknesses you have or your team has and then you pick which which you have to pick so it's it's not a an answer that you can give a blanket answer over everything right uh it definitely depends on specifics hopefully that makes sense i know it doesn't help it's easier if you can just have a this is the best thing go with it but that's not really how this this works um limbaugh says trying to understand why next js is needed okay the reason we went with next.js is for serverside rendering okay so if you're not familiar with nexjs uh it's it works with react right so you you run next js it builds out the basics bare bones of all your react project it handles your webpack config and it gives you a basic like file structure and it handles routing for you in this case we have custom routing but normally it handles the routing for you but what it does that is really awesome is serverside rendering by default why do we need serverside rendering because search engines won't be able to see your content right so they won't stick around long enough to wait to make the api call to get the data back and display it on the page right all click client side but when you render on the server what gets sent to the search engines when they come to your site and anybody else who comes to your site for they get html html css right all there and then after that what next will do is offer clientside routing so you really get the best of both worlds you get that serverside routing for that really fast initial load time and the um the ability for search engines to see your content and then after that you get that speed of it it actually prefetches content so that when a user clicks on a link sometimes they actually have instantaneous load so zero second load time because the data is already there so really awesome uh it definitely helps out right i i would not want to have to handle all the stuff that it does in the background on my own so they do a great job it's it's updated so frequently and it's very very reliable uh zubair says is this project going to be an app react native expo app well it's it's a progressive web app um so that's what we ended up building uh max says is python's still a good idea to learn yeah absolutely there's a lot of good work in um machine learning happening with python as far as i know uh so it depends on what you're into which you want to work with but you know python is definitely worthwhile uh marcio says hey jesse thank you for doing this you're welcome uh great value uh question how do i know that i'm ready to start learning a framework from your perspective of course if you have a good understanding of html css and at least basic javascript then i would say go ahead and learn the framework especially if there's a project that you want to use it with you think it would be beneficial um it can definitely help it could help you make some good stuff you know faster than you you would otherwise be able to um if there's a framework that a you know would look really good on your resume then that's you know that's a great bonus to to be able to have that on there if you've worked with it so just make sure though that you keep up your skills so as you're using this framework try not to get locked in too much depending on the framework it's it's easier harder to do that but make sure your your vanilla javascript skills still improve right your css html is still improved so as long as you're doing that and not really locking yourself in i think you're fine of course if you want to lock yourself in you know go ahead and do it but it does it may make it a bit harder down the road if that particular framework falls out of fashion uh it may make it harder to switch if you don't keep up with some of the other stuff hopefully it answered your question uh it says harsha by the way franciscan.edu going to the old site for me uh is it removed maybe i missed something at the beginning yeah yeah okay let me paste this so this is harsha you did miss something so uh if you want to at some point if you have time go back and watch the first couple of minutes um but basically the short story is uh the old website is back up and the new website that we made has been taken down but you can still see it at that the link that i just pasted in michael cruz says i want to watch live but i really want to know what's happened since yesterday so you go back can you go back and rewind and just watch the first 10 minutes and then come back you watch it on double speed and you'll catch up i guess okay uh rush rushikesh sorry if i'm mispronouncing this uh but they say i'm just a beginner in web development uh before react what should i learn or clear my basics yeah uh html css javascript focus on those if you're a beginner and um and and you'll be fine with that and then whenever you need to use a framework and you start working on more complex things when a framework will really help you then jump into that framework phoenix says hey jesse what's up congratulations i guess i can say that now right also i saw your instagram status uh was this a contract project no um so i explain a lot of it in more detail in the first 10 minutes of the stream but just you know long story short i will be i'm going to leave my position you know i'm most likely going to leave my position here at the university and find another job so if you want to know why that's happening watch the first 10 minutes of this video let's see uh zhang zhao i'm not sure i pronounced that apologies um it says i'm currently only comfortable with html css and javascript for the front end part how do i get the big picture when it comes to web development like how does the front end talk to the back end um yeah i would say you know probably look up some tutorials and courses if you go through the free code camp lessons at some point it transitions into that you know after you learn a lot of the front end stuff so that'll give you a good idea about how that that part works yeah so i mean you don't have to go through everything but if you just kind of skip to that part and kind of look over what's going on that may give you a good idea about what to focus in on more you know to be able to find some videos or um you know tutorials about it uh zooper says what database are you using my sql wordpress api yeah so we have my sequel and we're using the rest api and actually are we even using that anymore i think we're all graphql now uh we did use the rest api for search but now we switch to algolia for search so now i think we're using graphql with wordpress so we use the plugin called wp graphql to be able to use graphql with it michael creo says there's no such thing as just the website yeah it's always more it's really hot in my office so i'm going to turn my fan on low so if it's too noisy let me know but it's like it's insanely hot so i just need to need a little fan there it says swan says hey jesse why have you chose react instead of polymer or vue.js for example okay really good question um so let's see i don't know very much at all about polymer so it wasn't even really on my radar as a possibility i knew a little bit about vue but i had never used it before on uh on a project and when we first started working on this project the timeline was very condensed we ended up getting a very big extension on the timeline but you know a lot of the reasons for that are determined by people you know higher up above me in the organization so uh when we initially started i needed to go with something that i already knew and we had already built several things in react we already had a lot of code that i could knew i could reuse so that's why we ended up going with react had i had all the time in the world to learn and try something else i'm not sure if i would have gone with react i think it definitely worked in this situation so i'm not saying react was the absolute best way to go for this but given the constraints of the project it was the way to go uh for us for this for this project limbaugh says what you just said there helps me a lot oh awesome really glad i could help um nobody says you may not remember me but i do remember you uh you may not remember me but last year i used to pop on these streams and uh you inspired me to take uh programming what a year now i am i'm now a semi software engineer working in a real react project oh awesome i'm so glad you came back and told me that and i i do i remember i remember um i remember the name at least of you coming in here and talking so um that's so cool i love it whenever i hear things like that so that's really awesome if if you get a chance pop back in sometime and you know let me know how your project's going uh nasar says how are you uh i'm okay i'm okay i've been better a lot of stuff going on right now you could watch the first 10 minutes of this video uh if you want to know more about what's happening um but like right now i have a really really bad headache it just keeps getting worse so um but other than that i guess i can't complain i got a great wife and four healthy children and so i shouldn't complain you know it could be a lot worse uh diy coder says yes component reuse is a huge plus and routing also yeah for sure definitely agree with that harshit says algolia search for now it is gonna be expensive um let's see i lost my place it's gonna be expensive monetary costs there yeah uh so right now i'm just on the essentials plan so the lowest paid plan and since the site's not live i it's not going to be a big deal for now but yeah i for the time that it was live i was trying to monitor it sorry oh um i lost my train of thought i'm really sorry oh when i did when the site was live uh i had my dashboard for um algolia up all the time on all my computers so i always knew it was happening lisa he says feel better thank you i appreciate it a mod learns code says hi there have a nice day everyone hey how's it going thanks i hope you have a nice day as well phoenix says also since the time i started working on my blog site i have learned i've had learning i've had a ton of learning uh and the things that can go wrong are endless also it's now that i realize how important good a good documentation is yeah yeah documentation is good i i often slack on the documentation myself um but that's a good point limbaugh says wow awesome i really needed this uh cool i'm glad i'm glad you like this carabbo says the old site looks dated it it does it really does um it was very surprising to me when they switched back because it was pretty much unanimous from everybody i talked to that they did not like the old site so um and you know it was pretty much the consensus that like anything would be an improvement as long as it was faster um so yeah i was i was very surprised by it ours it says i just remember did you enable uh material ui css minification before prod uh command you in the page and check if not that will speed the page up by another five percent oh okay um that is a good tip i don't even remember i don't recall ever doing that let's see let's see our sources styles oh no that's not it no it's not i'm wondering like where are bundled styles coming from i don't think it's this no that's not it this is our just tiny bit of css which actually i didn't minify that either anyway i don't know how to check that out but that's good and see that's the thing too like the site was very fast and we hadn't we've done almost nothing to optimize the speed right like even the images aren't optimized we didn't run them through uh image compression or anything like that it was just so it was fast so all that stuff was gonna come later um but you know shaving so much time off that load time by switching the site was was worth it even if it wasn't completely as 100 optimized as it could be it was still really good uh i'm online learning code said i've heard about koa js can you explain the purpose of this technology briefly thanks potatoes i don't really know very much at all about koa so uh i am sorry about that but i i don't know enough to uh to give a good explanation if anybody else knows anything about koa please uh let me know roland says what is react i don't have any idea of this react is a javascript library for building uh web apps and you can build other things with it too yeah that's pretty it's like the basic concept of react um so yeah so it helps you to build uh to build websites and web apps and it it's very helpful with things like state management harshed says oh okay it says cola js server side framework built by the same people working on express uh jesse might not know about it because he mostly does front end you're absolutely right uh co is used for making performant apis okay cool thanks harshit matt desja says good morning all good morning thank you for uh for watching and stuff and in the live chat limbaugh says game says is access fus part of the same app or completely separate app it is completely separate um so it's actually run by an entirely different company different servers everything i don't have access to it although i was able to send a style sheet to this company and have them upload it so i was able to adjust the styles a bit make it a little bit more like material design style and but that was that was about it is it's pretty limited matt justice says uh best of luck in your transition jesse thank you so much i appreciate it uh roland says i'm curious about react nodes something like that even though i don't know uh any of those yeah it's uh react is a javascript library to build things like maybe like on on the client side like front end stuff node is using javascript on the back end so server side javascript a ish says graphql so uh graphql it's uh query language right so normally if you wanted to get well there's several ways to get data right but one way to get data um to your your front end is to use an api right and and the standard right now is kind of like rest apis um it's like a method of creating an api and getting data from it but the latest thing is graphql and the main difference is with a rest api you prebuild these these api endpoints and when you send a request to the endpoint you will get back a certain amount of data in a certain structure um based on what was already you know premade for that endpoint to give you in graphql when you send the request you tell graphql exactly what data you want and it sends you back just that data right no more no less so you uh you can end up making less api calls because right you don't have to hit multiple endpoints to get all the data you want and then the total amount of data that gets transferred is less because you just get what you want so um it is in that respect graphql was most definitely you know better um than a rest api in terms of how you build it on the back end i don't know enough about that to really know the pros and cons of it all but that's kind of i guess the the most concise way i can put uh you know what is graphql what is the difference between graphql and a rest api roland says where can i learn php um a lot of places i guess uh maybe if you're really new um try out uh like codecademy they have these like interactive courses uh i've done some of their courses before i almost positive they have a php course so i would check that out first michael says okay i'll watch later from the beginning just don't burn any bridges that you might need later it's always darkest before the dawn that is good advice i appreciate that uh thanks michael mattheson says oh feel better jesse i hope so and thanks for saying that uh limbaugh says health and long life to you all thank you thank you and you too um john f says how did free code cam contact you about streaming here um i started doing live streaming on my own channel and i did a few live streams and i i knew that i didn't really know what i was doing so i posted in the free code camp forum a link to my live streams and i asked if anybody would be able to give me advice on how to do a better job and beau karns who does a ton of awesome javascript tutorial videos for free code camp contacted me and asked if i'd be interested in live coding for free code camp uh and then shortly afterwards i also talked to quincy who's the head of free code camp and then i just i started doing live streams and they went well uh people watched them you know quincy and bo like them so here i am i still still doing the streams let's see mark marcio says thank you thanks for answering my questions i hope you keep doing this kind of live question answer take some advil and rest uh thanks thank you for that advice i think i i probably will just go home after the stream and and relax a little bit nobody says yes i'll pop back more often i can now start to understand what was going on unlike last year thank you all right cool very cool um stephen says hey jesse i twitter message you austin texas there's a ton of react jobs available uh indeed you ship rooster teeth etc all here oh really cool thank you so much um jennings al says hope you feel better if you have time exercise yeah that's true i didn't get my my regular workout in today or yesterday uh so i i need to work out like today um or else i'm gonna it's definitely gonna impact my mental health if i if i quit with my workouts um aish says is routing there in both react and node.js yes yes so we have both server side and clientside routing stephen says plus pay says plus pay is way higher in austin yeah that's for sure well one thing is i'm almost guaranteed to be paid more at a new position than i am paid here higher education uh doesn't neces especially at a nonprofit institution doesn't really pay as well as other other industries limbaugh says is there a video where you talk much about price to maintain an app this size uh yeah so an app like this right now and while it was live i believe we were spending maybe like 500 a month on all the hosting and everything that goes with that and that 500 it might have been a little bit overkill because i didn't want the site to go down or slow up so it potentially after the site had been live for a while we could check the analytics and finetune things we might have been able to get that cost down a little bit more but that cost includes a server a droplet on digitalocean um cloud sql database and google cloud platform also on google cloud platform app engine instances and storage buckets and then included with that cost is also the cost of the algolia search service there are a few other things we want i wanted to add in that would have cost more so i wanted to add in sentry for error tracking and i also wanted to add a cdn so those would have brought the price up a bit more maybe another 100 bucks or so maybe 200 depending on the traffic steven says g fuel coffee i know i'm trying to cut out caffeine but man maybe i should just maybe i should just give in caffeine um chang yon song sorry about the name says hello it's 2 a.m in korea first time to watch a live and ask a question uh what would you recommend to study before learning react um says someone already asked sorry for answering this again uh yeah no problem it's uh i learned html css and javascript and that's that's all you need before you learn react irish it says just watch the first 10 minutes feel better thank you i appreciate it emiliano says hi jesse here from argentina greetings hey how's it going thanks for watching um shadrach says greetings from nigeria um let's say uh ch changgyon says uh thanks actually i'm studying javascript i was just wondering if there's more yeah no javascript's good you know and then you should be able to jump into react it'll take a little time to get used to it but if you're solid with javascript then you know go ahead and jump in um let's see five i'm not sure how to pronounce this um but anyways which frame shirt framework should i use for back end um i don't know i mean i like express would you consider expressive framework i'm not really sure what to call it but i i usually use node and express i but i mean it really just depends on like a lot of factors for what you're trying to do um which course is better today's generation i'm not exactly sure what you're asking so maybe clarify that a little bit please and i can i can answer um harsh it's saying click view source of course why wouldn't i remember a view source because i only use view source when i accidentally click it when i'm trying to hit inspect and yeah it looks like it's not even minified well that's awesome i'm actually really happy about that because that means we can make this even faster cool phoenix says i would like this opportunity to thank you for all these streams uh that that you did i stumbled on this on my worst times and i have been better and hooked ever since oh thank you for saying that i'm i'm so glad that that this stream is has helped you out and um and thanks for being here i know you you know you contribute a lot to the chat and things i really appreciate that swan says first thanks for answering my question i watched the part where you explained why you quit be strong man you you're amazing i hope you know it uh that guy's just allergic to intellect good luck yeah i actually didn't i didn't quit yet so like i'm in my office right now so i'm gonna be here for a little while longer so i have no idea how much longer it just it depends i guess on when i find something else and and what hap i don't think that i'm gonna get fired over anything um but yeah so i don't know exactly how long i'll be here but i haven't exactly quit yet but it's not it's not a secret that i'm looking for other employment the head of my department knows um there's actually other people the university that are helping me look for for new work so it's i i'm okay talking about it phoenix says you are also one of the major reasons that i went ahead and loved development the way you just dive into new tech framework and then make things work is amazing thanks i really appreciate that they don't always work but sometimes you try things out it doesn't work but yeah it's it's fun i mean this work is awesome it's so fun you get to try new things all the time and even if it doesn't work like it's still fun and you learn something right and uh and a lot of times it does work and it's really awesome um i want to learn css3 to a dope level from where should i learn it um hey well i mean you could it depends on where you're at right now if you're just starting out check out the free code cam lessons if you're a little bit more advanced then i don't really know there's probably some some good css books um videos uh i don't know if there's online tutorials advanced css hmm i'm not exactly sure if anybody has any that if you know of any really advanced css tutorials please let us know in the chat or in the comments if you're watching this later um donchi says hey jesse what do you think about the python framework django for web development thank you in advance keep up the good work i don't know very much at all about django i've heard of it and that's about it so apologies for that i just uh i i just don't know enough to give you a good answer limbaugh says 500 ouch thanks to the uh detailed answer yeah i mean 500 um is a i would say not that much at all for a larger organization i mean like the university employs like four or five hundred people you know so for our organization that size five hundred dollars a month is not not really that much um you know we probably spend more than that on water electricity internet like pretty much every other thing that we have i'm really sorry i'm having trouble pronouncing this why are you sorry uh says hey jesse i'm experienced with react js node.js and mongodb how do i come up with ideas for side projects that have potential to generate income and future and become my own startup um i don't know that's that's if if i knew a really good answer to that question then i'd probably do it too um but yeah i mean i would say if you're looking for good ideas of things that people actually want to use so you can make money from just uh ask people around you like what what do you wish you could do like what what things in your life do you wish could be automated or enhanced or somehow with you know something on your phone or whatever right um think about what you do every day like is there something you could build that would help you odds are if you build something and it helps you it'll probably help other people so think that's a good place to start right and then if you build it nobody wants it well at least you build something cool that'll help you out right so you haven't lost everything right um bill corn says i came in late and just watched the beginning of the stream i'm so excited to hear that jesse uh that jesse is looking isn't looking for a job because he was fired jesse is awesome thank you thank you so much about yeah yeah i i was not fired i don't think i will end up being fired so it was not it was not fired so this is of of my own free will um matt duchess says vitamin b works better than caffeine yeah you're right actually i think i do have some vitamin b pills at home so maybe i'll just take that when i go home oh okay so then one of the names i couldn't pronounce is siddharth but it's it's written with uh like half in in numbers so okay i kind of thought it might be something like that but i was trying to limit how silly i sounded so i just didn't try it thank you for telling me though and if i've mispronounced anyone's name please let me know how to pronounce it and i'll do my best to remember that and pronounce it the right way every time uh himanshu says what to learn to start making websites html css and javascript that's what you need you learn those you'll be good and you can build you can build anything with that delay b says what back end should i learn with react there is no job with node.js and i don't want to do php um i don't know i mean if you can't find a job with node something what else do people use for backups like python um there's a whole area that uses like net framework with c sharp so i mean that you know maybe that would be my advice uh md says hello um daily at what time the classes begin and i want to learn from starting how can i learn uh you know what i the i'm assuming you're talking about these live streams you know we've been starting at such weird times so i can't really say it'd be nice if i get back on a normal schedule but right now just too many things are going on that i i can't stick to a certain time so unfortunately there is no set time right now shang xiao says many people use coding as an escape as a way to find another route in their life hope whoever is doing it finds passion and luck along the way yeah that's cool learning how to code definitely has helped a lot of people just you know have a totally different lifestyle a lot of times you know for the better lymbola says i strongly suggest jonas at udemy uh i took many before him and jonas advanced css course is the best that i found thank you so much for that recommendation so jonas has an advanced css course on udemy check that out um richaus says what are the prerequisites for learning react uh javascript for sure i mean html and css and javascript if you know those you're good to learn react siddhar says which languages are you comfortable with and how did you start your journey as a web developer um javascript i'm most comfortable with i know a little php and i've done a little bit with python before with c sharp um java c plus plus like i've done a little bit with a lot of stuff but i'm only really confident with javascript and somewhat maybe confident with php md bubba says please tell me i can contact with you i want to learn um you can find me on like twitter and i think i have a link to my twitter in the in the description uh that i don't really do like courses or anything like that so if you have any questions i'll do my best to help out but you know for right now i don't i'm not doing courses although that might be something that you know i might do at some point okay emiliano wants to know um what other css framework do i recommend um i mean i i use mostly material ui i like that if i'm not doing react i use materialize css sorry so i haven't really used a lot of other frameworks so i don't know that i can really give any good recommendations outside of those ones um says codeigniter or laravel um as far as i know code igniter is pretty outdated correct me if i'm wrong so i would probably go with laravel if i were you those are both uh for php uh manu says uh what should i learn before react uh javascript css html uh swan says why didn't you use uh serverless tech for your back end cloud functions firebase um yeah we i thought about that but uh you know it's something that i wasn't familiar enough with that i was confident in doing it in a project of this size you know in this this much importance you know um so the way we're doing it now you know it's for the most part we've tested out before so i felt more confident in that um mit says make some series of kali linux tutorial i don't i've never used kali linux so if i end up using it maybe i'll do a series on it julia says hello jesse uh should you use uh saga or redux thunk i have used thunk before i like it i have not used sagas before uh julia says uh what do you think about laravel is it a good to learn yeah if you're gonna learn a php framework i from what my limited knowledge about it i do recommend laravel i've heard good things about it shrey says i'm currently working with asp.net and microsoft sql server is the dotnet framework losing its significance what future do you imagine isn't storefront.net framework i don't really know i mean i'm not a huge fan of.net framework but i see a lot there's a lot of new stuff happening with it um even like microsoft is really kind of changing the way it it interacts with the developer community so you know i think it'll be around for a while just because of microsoft really um and there's so many companies that are already kind of entrenched in the whole net world it's not going anywhere anytime soon so if if it can be i think if the net world can be more integrated with the rest of like the javascript dev world and take advantage a lot of that stuff i i think it has a good shot at you know being relevant and being around you know for a long time so dar says can i get javascript tutorials at free code cam yeah there's a whole course on javascript on the freecodecam.org website but then also we have a ton of video tutorials as well on our youtube channel andrew says hey jesse site looks great i saw on instagram you're looking around for your opportunities i'm sure you'll be picked up in no time oh thank you i appreciate it um a man who asks what's the best procedure for learning react in a pro way online courses um how to turn off my music my headache's getting so terrible um uh so anything else we're doing a project in that but looking into documentation makes that kind of difficult um free codecamp has some react stuff now on freecodecam.org wow i need to like take a nap um yeah so i would check that out there's definitely a lot of good tutorial videos on react out there so that might be a little bit easier than trying to read the documentation says i'm mostly just fixing bugs at work small issues which arise out of changes such additions the code base is this what developers do in the us yeah but it depends some developers main job is fixing bugs maintenance other developers build new stuff and don't handle you know live you know products so it just kind of depends juggernaut says jesse if you could choose where you want to go what's your dream don't even know um i don't know i have to think about that uh yeah i guess it is like there's different parts to that so it's like right now like i always got to think about like my fame my wife and family you know it's not just like where do i want to go that would be awesome it's you know where could i go that would be the best for my kids that would have good schools and things like that so it's kind of a complicated question uh because i have to think about all those things so um yeah so i'm not exactly exactly sure i mean in terms of work though um i love working on cutting edge stuff and i i love working on things that that would actually help people um siddhartha says i'm learning javascript but i don't know where to implement that i mean i want to work on some projects um from where should i get one yep check out the free code camp curriculum because they'll have a lot of sample projects where you'll be able to use javascript on i would recommend that that's a good place to start uh is it would still be useful to learn jquery in 2018 um yeah you know what there's still a lot of companies that use jquery for their website so knowing jquery is still good um going forward i expect probably the use of jquery will go down because there are other things taking its place so i don't know what the outlook is like for the future but a lot of companies depending on how big they are and what the industry is like are very very slow to change things so there's still going to be jquery jobs around for a long time just because of that um mit says what should i do so that people know me hmm really sorry i just can't quit yawning so people know me in the it field this is what happens when you try to give up caffeine i guess yeah get involved um online like i mean as a developer like twitter is a huge thing so i don't know if it's the same with it stuff but yeah like get involved on twitter you know follow the people that are the like leaders in your field uh you know like retweet their stuff try to interact um that's probably that's a really good you know good way to go if you can like write articles like tutorials or you know do videos like i don't really write that much but i like to do the videos um you know volunteer to help people go to conferences uh when you go to conferences make sure you talk to as many people as you can so all those things will will help marlin says have you ever noticed jankiness when your background loads for the first time with react i get no lag when using the image tag but when i switch to background image it takes about two seconds to load yeah sometimes when you use background image you can have a little bit of jank so um try not to use it hold on let's say this hey all right thank you cool i just got handed a like a print brochure thing and so i can check it out see if i want to use any photos for the website and then they will get me the photos so that's kind of cool so my team here is very helpful like the other people in in this department um are super helpful uh sorry i was right in the middle i think oh the jankiness with the background image yeah so using a css background image uh definitely takes it it stresses out the browser more than using an image tag so you want to be careful with that don't use it like a bunch on one page try to make sure your image is optimized and if you have a ton of stuff going on on a page you maybe don't want to use it trying to do like parallax things like we're doing here right with our um i don't even remember what it's called in css now it's a property when you use a background image that that makes it do that so that can also cause some trouble so if you disable that you'll you'll have a much better time of it so if you notice let's say like that the image isn't showing up first it could be that like maybe you want to take that css and load it sooner right so if you have the css for that in a css file and it's waiting its turn to get loaded then it's going to take a while so what you can do you can make that background css be inline in the html and it'll load a lot more quickly or if you don't want to put it like right in the html tag you could just take it and put a style tag at the head of your document and put that above all the other things that you you want to load like all your files you're bringing in and that's kind of like a little trick to use for the stuff that's like users will see immediately i mean and then of course like the image size itself will definitely have an impact on how fast it loads too emiliano's coffee coffee coffee um trey says how is work like for trainee software developers in the us who are straight out of college in the first six months i honestly have no idea because that's not the route i went so i i've never i i've never seen it oh okay so uh i got a pronunciation here so wa wah weiru let me know if that's the right pronunciation thank you so much for for letting me know how to pronounce that um jesse says or andrew says jesse do companies use create react app in production i'm not sh i'm not sure i mean it's it's pretty commonly used but i couldn't tell you right now like of a specific company that does use it so i mean i i don't know i imagine yes but i definitely have to look that up i wouldn't want to say for sure without without checking uh siddhar says how's o'reilly's javascript book for learning javascript i want to have a handbook kind of thing for html css so that i can memorize them i don't know i haven't checked out that book so uh there are some good there's a javascript book called eloquent javascript that's really good and then there's a book series called you don't know js that also is very good so they're available online but you you can get them in print as well so check those out uh siddharth says what can i do to memorize html and css3 tags and attributes just use them right i've never attempted to memorize them like just use them and if you code every day with them you will remember them uh so that's i think is the the best way to go about memorization right because just look them up and you will remember them right the annoyance of having to look them up will force you to memorize them right it's so much better to do it that way than to try to like sit down and read a list of them right you may as well be actually getting coding done while you're memorizing hopefully that that makes sense it's just like the best way to learn a language is to actually speak it be immersed in it you know like a spoken language i think that's the same way with a computer language right just just use it and look up what you need to until you don't need to look it up anymore java oracle python which one do i have to learn uh for a job you can get a job with any of them it just depends on what you want to do so just figure out what you want to do and then do a little bit of research on what companies are using what language right and and then you know do a search see what how many jobs there are for that and that should kind of tell you phoenix says are you wearing red pants yeah i'm wearing red pants so i don't know if you can see i'm wearing yeah i'm wearing red pants so yeah they are if anybody is interested in wearing the same red pants as me you can find them they're bonobos is the brand and they're bonobos uh chinos i don't know what exactly the color isn't called or anything like that but they're nice pants they fit well uh andrew said oh andrew was talking to somebody else um juggernaut says jesse uh you want to continue web development or you're looking for other endeavors like systems games etc i'm thinking i'll probably just continue with like react development because that's most likely what i'll be able to get a job in but i'd definitely be open to other things like game development sounds fun uh anything that has to do with some like newer stuff uh like machine learning uh sounds really cool um you know like uh vr or ar sounds awesome to work with so i'm open to new opportunities i just am not sure that i have the skill set to get hired in those positions right now uh md baba says i want to learn machine learning how can i learn um try out udacity has some machine learning courses i think they have some free ones so see try those out because i i think they're pretty good and see if you like it if you really like it and you want to do their paid courses then those are available too julia says well i have to to know object oriented php in order to start learning laravel i don't know i don't know enough about laravel so sorry uh par says what is your view on google versus oracle um if you mean like the whole lawsuit that was going on between them i i think it's i side with google in that lawsuit so basically like google was using so oracle owns the language java google was using java in android's operating system and oracle sued them um claiming that i think like google owed them a bunch of money for using java when because they own java so it's kind of ridiculous like if we start saying that companies can own programming languages that's just crazy right it to me like if that's how oracle oracle is going to do this then you know people aren't going to use it anymore right it's so that's like probably an oversimplification of what's happening and i could be wrong so if i'm wrong correct me please but um i just think it sets a bad standard if you're going to allow oracle to kind of win that that case um manuswar says hi what are the languages i should go for if i want to become an ethical hacker as well as get into android development um java or or kotlin for android development and as a hacker like i mean you you just need whatever you're trying to hack you need to know how that works so um you would i would assume i'm i'm not a hacker so this is assumption so you know don't take it as the way to go but i would assume you would need to have more of a general knowledge of a lot of systems uh and then you would need to like seriously do your homework on the particular system you're about to hack uh siddharth says is there any direct use of c language and web development in web development not that i know of i've never come across it but it you know could be out there um what about c sharp yeah c sharp is used in like dot net framework stuff so i have come across that in for the back end in web development limbala says have you used react native and what do you think about it as uh as a newbie learning react i'm not sure if i should focus on progressive web apps with react or react native you learn react first unless for some reason you really need to make a mobile app um i like react native i i really like like building things with react native and i i hope that i can do more with it in the future so but i think if you're coming from knowing html and css and javascript trying to get into the react world it's an easier jump to learn regular react first than to go into react native because there's a few extra kind of things you have to think about when you're building for um for a mobile phone right to building an uh mobile app right so it it's a little bit easier uh if you're still doing things to the web and a lot of what you learn in react will help you to learn react native yeah uh lymbala says i'm focusing on mobile apps or small businesses yeah if you're focusing on mobile apps then then learn react native first because that's what you'll need i know progressive web apps can be downloaded on the home screen but a lot of people just don't get that yet and don't realize that that's a thing so probably you're going to have a better time of it and a better time selling your services to small businesses if you use a mobile app um so ron says can i go for the react without the node.js yeah for sure you don't have to use node.js for react great can be used with any type of backend we have another react versus angular question uh so i'm just gonna say it it just depends on your project there's there's no there's no quick answer for react versus angular marlon says thanks for the help jesse gonna try sorting this background jank out by the way how do you personally go about styling and react style components um i have used style components before but normally um just use like css and js sometimes i use normal style sheets sometimes i just do inline styles i do a variety of things i haven't decided on what i really like want to stick with yet siddhar says uh what are the steps to become a full stack web developer um you could either start with the front or the back end i started with front end so i'll go over that html javascript css um after that then then you start to learn more about backend stuff so if you already know javascript i recommend going with node learn about a little bit about node how to set up uh you know your your server your your basic routing maybe do like some handling of form data emails things like that in node um learn about apis how to build apis how to use apis like you know and and branch out from there right and i mean that's just the javascript ecosystem so there's a whole lot of other stuff if you want to get into other languages and i'm sure i mean i'm probably i'm leaving out a lot of stuff right so but that's just the basic route you take uh limbala says thanks so much for these uh so useful answers i will be checking out your 200 other videos here yeah if anybody ever manages to watch all of my videos please let me know because that would be i mean i've been around for all of them but that's a lot of content right in apologies because i'm sure i probably have some like weird annoying things that i do and and having to suffer through all those uh probably not the best um but balaji says is there any way to improve the speed access of websites much faster than regular scripts languages uh yeah there's there's definitely a lot you can do um you know one of the biggest things that i always do going in if people want me to improve speed is check the image sizes so many times it's that images are way too large you know they're only showing a tiny image but in reality the file is actually huge image compression could be even like you know what's being loaded and when is it being loaded um sometimes websites will have all this tracking stuff so you got your analytics and then you got your social media things that come in and they said way too much going on and don't realize how much it's it's impacting uh their site right if you use like some thirdparty things sometimes they're bringing in whole libraries like and you don't even realize like other versions of jquery and stuff just to do one tiny little thing so like all of those things can can definitely help out with speed you can set up like a cdn and that'll help the speed so there's a lot of uh quick things you can do that don't really take that much time but can have a huge impact on your site speed i think i did a video once where we try to take an old site and make it faster or like a couple of videos it may it'll be one of my early videos on free code camp or it may be one of my videos i did on my own channel uh before i started doing free code camp so i think there's a link to my channel in the description if you want to try to find it um i do have some some videos on there as well uh s sumits says what do you think about reason ml and reason reacts uh reason seems really cool when i went to react rally ken wheeler gave a talk about reason and that was the first time i really like learned anything about reason other than just hearing it and it seems really awesome i don't know enough about it to really give a good explanation of it um but it's something that i would be open to using in the future and i think it could help me write like better better code so i'm definitely i'm i'm a fan of it but a very new fan uh saran says do web development does web development involve algorithms and data structure in javascript not really a lot i mean algorithms and stuff like that you need to know for job interviews right but in reality like you don't use them very much at all in daytoday web development so if you're not great with them don't worry you can still be a good web developer without being great at algorithms siddhar says thanks a lot for your for the answers going to watch your javascript tutorials awesome yeah and check out like on this on this channel uh beau carnes does a ton of javascript tutorials that are awesome uh constantine says hey jesse how long did it take you to become a front end atlanta first shot so i was a freelancer for a while so maybe like three years before i got this fulltime job so like during that time it's not like i was always looking for jobs i was freelancing right so um but like i learned more and more as time progressed and i picked up more clients and try to do more challenging jobs so it was like a three year period of me slowly picking up new things but working while i was doing it getting basically getting paid to learn so i don't think it would always take it certainly wouldn't take three years for most people but because i was freelancing while i was doing it i wasn't really like actively looking for for fulltime um like a fulltime developer position siddhar says keep teaching us and uh balaji says thanks for your knowledge it is so useful oh i i appreciate you saying this um every says hi jesse just watch the first 10 minutes of the streaming i'm really sorry for what happened to you uh hashtag we are with you thank you so much i appreciate that um make tutorials on operating system programming it's hard to learn yeah i don't know anything about that so i can only make a tutorial on things i know about um soran says thanks for guiding us through live videos and always up to uh live with jesse uh nami says hello jesse you're a great teacher and i've learned a lot but still lost i need help with javascript and learning the codes and let me know i'm um i'm about to end the stream now but mammy you know get a hold of me on twitter or something you can always ask me a question on there as well man as far as how to get started in android development uh you could if you want to just do android and you don't want to do like react native um then you know try to find some android tutorials you're probably gonna end up using java or kotlin for that siddharth says what is franciscan uh franciscan if university of steubenville is the college that i currently work for uh saron says do you have experience with machine learning with javascript very very little experience like i've done some tutorials and watched videos on using brain js and tensorflow um js so i i have some ideas for stuff i want to build but i just haven't built anything yet uh ahmad says afternoon javascript which framework do you prefer reactor angular i prefer react but i don't have a problem with angular i just i just work with react so all right i'm going to end things now i've been streaming for a while and i think i've gotten so many messages i keep seeing my phone going off so i'm going to check these and hopefully if there's nothing like major that i need to do at work i'm going to i'm going to head home for the day and uh and relax a little bit tadar says you made the franciscan website yes i did so the website you see back here this is what we made um in live stream the whole process all right so i see a few more things coming up but i'm gonna i'm gonna have to cut the stream off it there's so many great questions i i really enjoy this but this this could probably keep going forever um but i i love all the questions i love all like the the interest and everything and i'm gonna try to do another stream you know when i can and uh hopefully after i do my react training next week i'll have a ton of new stuff to share with you about react so i'm super excited about that and i'll definitely let you know all the cool stuff that i learned if anybody happens to be in the dc area specifically in like um tyson's corner virginia around there uh let me know you know maybe we can hang out next week or something um and uh yeah so until next time have a wonderful day and thanks again
