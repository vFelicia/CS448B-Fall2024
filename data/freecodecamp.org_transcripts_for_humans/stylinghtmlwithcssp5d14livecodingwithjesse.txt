00:07 - hey everybody it's jesse and welcome to
00:10 - live coding with jesse
00:13 - and today we're going to do really basic
00:15 - stuff so
00:17 - we have some html and we need to style
00:19 - it this is within the context of our
00:22 - react app
00:23 - but we're not really going to do any
00:25 - react stuff today
00:28 - so
00:29 - if you're here for react and you're used
00:31 - to the react stuff then you might be
00:33 - disappointed um
00:35 - but this should be
00:37 - a great stream for beginners because
00:40 - normally if you're interested in web
00:42 - development you start out learning html
00:45 - and css
00:47 - so if you're in that
00:49 - that area of just just starting out
00:52 - then stick around for this video
00:55 - and if you're a little bit more advanced
00:58 - in that area
00:59 - it would still be cool to stick around
01:01 - and help answer some questions uh in the
01:03 - live chat uh from some of the newer
01:05 - people and
01:07 - you never know i'll probably mess
01:09 - something up so help is always
01:10 - appreciated
01:13 - uh okay so i think
01:16 - i do have a meeting about this site that
01:19 - i will be creating in the stream
01:21 - in an hour and a half
01:24 - so i'm just gonna try to do two pomodoro
01:26 - sessions
01:28 - and uh some question answer and then
01:30 - finish up
01:32 - uh so we do have kind of a cap we can't
01:34 - go longer than
01:36 - i'd say hour and fifteen minutes
01:39 - uh that should give me enough time
01:42 - to get ready and get to my meeting
01:45 - okay
01:46 - so we have uh a good number of viewers
01:48 - so maybe some new people uh let me just
01:51 - explain briefly how this is gonna go so
01:54 - i'm about to start a pomodoro timer
01:58 - it's a 25 minute session we're going to
02:00 - code for 25 minutes
02:03 - and then i'm going to take a five minute
02:04 - break and check out the live chat answer
02:06 - any questions that you have in the live
02:08 - chat then i'm going to do another 25
02:10 - minute session of code
02:12 - and then after that i'm going to answer
02:14 - all the questions in the live chat so if
02:16 - you ask a question in the chat and i
02:18 - haven't got to it yet just hang on
02:21 - and i will get to it before the stream
02:24 - is over
02:26 - and then if you can't stick around for
02:27 - the whole stream don't worry about it
02:29 - you can watch it later on uh it will be
02:32 - available here on the free code camp
02:34 - youtube channel
02:37 - uh there's more information in the
02:38 - description like links to the github
02:40 - repo and
02:42 - um
02:43 - i don't know what else i have in there i
02:45 - guess there's a lot of stuff i always
02:47 - just copy and paste it so i don't even
02:49 - know what i have in there but there are
02:51 - some helpful links in there
02:52 - okay so let's start this up
02:55 - and then i'm gonna go over here to my
02:57 - editor i happen to be using visual
02:59 - studio code
03:02 - sometimes i use atom but today i'm using
03:05 - visual studio code
03:06 - and
03:08 - i'm going to shrink this terminal just a
03:10 - bit because we won't be using it too
03:11 - much
03:13 - what i do want to do though
03:16 - is save what i was just working on
03:19 - which is actually a whole nother
03:21 - uh page uh react component so it's not
03:24 - quite working but it's almost there so
03:27 - i'm going to save it now
03:29 - so we can start fresh and make a nice
03:33 - git commit at the end of the stream
03:37 - let me check the status
03:40 - we're going to add this file
03:45 - oops
03:46 - and then i'm going to leave a message so
03:55 - and we'll check out what i've just done
03:57 - here in a in a future stream i've
03:59 - already brought in all the
04:01 - all the data
04:02 - into our wordpress installation
04:04 - uh so we'll need to do some styling for
04:07 - that page at some point
04:09 - um there we go
04:11 - whoa we got a lot of testing going on
04:16 - it's good all the tests are passing i
04:18 - have not made a test yet for this
04:20 - directory.js it wouldn't pass because
04:22 - it's not working
04:24 - but once we get it working
04:26 - then we want to get tests on it as well
04:29 - be very similar to the tests we have for
04:31 - faculty.js
04:33 - okay so let's get to some of our html
04:36 - and css so this is our
04:39 - our react component
04:41 - we're not really going to do anything
04:43 - at all with this react component we're
04:45 - going to be mostly working in
04:48 - dev tools and chrome devtools
04:51 - and then we're just going to kind of
04:52 - copy over our styles
04:55 - so what i would like to do though is
04:57 - make a new folder
04:59 - in our static
05:02 - file so i know if you're if you're
05:04 - familiar with react and you've done
05:06 - things with react this is not at all the
05:07 - normal react way to do things so if
05:10 - you're confused just hold on for a few
05:12 - more minutes and it'll become really
05:13 - obvious why we have to do things this
05:15 - way okay so this is not ideal i wouldn't
05:18 - normally want to do it this way
05:20 - but everything is entirely valid in
05:22 - terms of just regular html
05:25 - uh
05:26 - but
05:28 - because of the time frame where the site
05:29 - has to be made live we're gonna i guess
05:32 - kind of do things a little bit weird at
05:33 - first to save time and then after we
05:35 - launch behind the scenes we're going to
05:37 - clean everything up little by little
05:40 - so that it'll be a smooth transition but
05:42 - it'll buy us a lot more time to make
05:44 - things right
05:46 - i do see a lot of activity in the live
05:48 - chat so if you're just joining a live
05:50 - chat i will take a break after a little
05:52 - while and i'll answer all the questions
05:54 - in the live chat so just hang in there
05:56 - i'm i'm not ignoring you at least not
05:58 - for
05:59 - not forever
06:00 - all right so let's make a new folder
06:04 - and you can also do this from the
06:05 - command line uh
06:07 - but if you're not that familiar with the
06:09 - command line it might be easier to do it
06:10 - like this
06:12 - new folder and we're going to call this
06:15 - styles
06:17 - and then within the styles folder we're
06:19 - going to make a new file
06:21 - and we're going to call this
06:26 - faculty
06:28 - dot css because that's the page that
06:30 - we're going to be on so
06:32 - it may make more sense at some point to
06:35 - extract some of the things we put in
06:36 - faculty out you know up to um
06:40 - a different
06:41 - uh set of css a different file and then
06:44 - share it among components but for now
06:46 - this this should be good uh we're i
06:49 - normally would like to use sas instead
06:51 - of just plain css but we don't have that
06:53 - set up yet for this project so maybe
06:55 - we'll set it up later but
06:57 - um
06:58 - today it should be
07:00 - it should actually be better this way
07:02 - because it'll be you know more basic for
07:03 - those of you who haven't really gotten
07:05 - into sas
07:06 - all right so let me bring over
07:09 - the site so you all can see what we're
07:11 - starting with
07:13 - uh and what we're starting with is just
07:15 - the very you know basic
07:18 - basic of
07:20 - of sites
07:21 - html with almost no styling
07:24 - so
07:25 - this is what we're starting with we have
07:27 - this data
07:28 - which doesn't look like much i know
07:31 - but
07:33 - what
07:35 - what we have here behind the scenes is a
07:38 - lot of structure to this data in terms
07:40 - of the tags
07:42 - so we just need to style those uh it'll
07:44 - probably be a good idea to make these
07:47 - images actually work the paths all broke
07:49 - when we transfer things from one
07:50 - database to another
07:52 - so let me make these images work first
07:55 - i'd hope to have time to do this
07:57 - beforehand but i got caught up uh with
07:59 - some other data
08:02 - so just for this
08:08 - i'm going to change i'm going to
08:10 - manually change the the files there
08:24 - and i'm gonna add
08:36 - so on my other screen
08:41 - i'm just changing the urls for these
08:44 - images manually
08:46 - so that they will point to the right
08:47 - place
08:48 - so i believe
08:50 - we only have two images
08:54 - let's see
09:01 - okay let's update that
09:03 - and see
09:05 - if we have images now
09:07 - there we go we have images
09:08 - okay so one of these images is supposed
09:11 - to be for
09:13 - a
09:14 - a detail view and one is supposed to be
09:17 - for what they call a list view on the
09:18 - other side
09:20 - so we'll just hide one of them for now
09:25 - eventually
09:26 - we won't have to deal with two at all
09:29 - but for right now
09:32 - i don't want to edit the data too much
09:34 - because we have a lot of data here and
09:37 - and any manual editing we do is is going
09:39 - to end up taking a long time if we want
09:42 - to duplicate that for everything
09:44 - so
09:45 - for now let's just take
09:48 - the smaller of the two images which i
09:50 - believe is
09:52 - this image
09:54 - let's see image there we go and for the
09:57 - list view image we want to just hide
09:59 - that completely so that'll be the first
10:01 - thing that we put here in our css so
10:06 - let me make sure this view image yep all
10:08 - lower case
10:12 - list you image
10:14 - and
10:15 - i'm going to say
10:17 - display
10:19 - none
10:25 - okay you know what i forgot to uh to
10:27 - actually hook this in here uh so let's
10:29 - do that as
10:30 - as well let's see
10:33 - so my
10:34 - let me see for my react people here
10:37 - what's the easiest way right now for me
10:39 - to connect this to the component
10:41 - uh from my static files
10:44 - i'll check the the chat in just a minute
10:46 - after delay's over and see what what you
10:48 - are saying
10:57 - but for now
11:00 - we could do
11:05 - none okay so
11:07 - if you've never used chrome dev tools
11:10 - before
11:12 - it's really good you can inspect
11:14 - anything on a page and manipulate it
11:16 - right here in your browser none of the
11:17 - changes are permanent if you refresh the
11:20 - page they all go away
11:22 - but it allows you to make a lot of
11:23 - changes here
11:25 - uh really easily just to see what
11:27 - they're like
11:28 - um so that's kind of you know what we're
11:32 - what we're gonna do for it for this okay
11:34 - so i could see
11:36 - uh
11:37 - using next head is probably the best way
11:39 - to go according to harshit so thank you
11:46 - all right
11:47 - so let's go
11:50 - import and this is some react stuff so
11:53 - if you're not really familiar with react
11:54 - don't worry about this we're going to go
11:56 - back to the normal css here in a second
11:59 - let's see
12:06 - and we're just doing this so that our
12:08 - css will be applied to these this
12:11 - component which controls that page
12:14 - okay so
12:16 - just have to do a little bit you know
12:19 - differently than you know we normally
12:21 - would
12:22 - uh so let's
12:24 - let's see if i can put
12:38 - all right so within the head then can i
12:40 - just put regular
12:42 - link tags
12:45 - i think i think i can i think we could
12:47 - do just regular link tag
12:53 - all right so we will do that
12:58 - link
12:59 - is it
13:00 - source for a link tag
13:02 - or href i can never remember
13:10 - i think it's an href
13:13 - i guess we'll find out in a second
13:16 - um
13:23 - okay so we have to do rel and ahref
13:32 - h
13:34 - thanks thanks everyone in the live chat
13:36 - for helping out with that
13:37 - okay so our href is going to be
13:41 - what we got static
13:44 - where we'll be at
13:48 - right let's just try it as
13:52 - static
13:53 - css
14:04 - oops
14:11 - all right let's see
14:20 - okay not working
14:23 - let's just inspect this and see i
14:25 - imagine it has something to do with the
14:26 - path
14:29 - um
14:53 - mm-hmm
15:02 - uh rayon is saying add in type text css
15:07 - okay we'll add that in
15:18 - all right let's check that out then
15:24 - hmm
15:28 - all right let's see let's check our
15:29 - sources see if it'll tell us oops i mean
15:32 - our console
15:33 - um
15:37 - okay so that's definitely not the right
15:39 - path
15:52 - static
16:15 - can i see the structure all right here's
16:17 - our folder structure
16:19 - um
16:22 - style
16:23 - oh you know what it's the wrong thing i
16:26 - didn't call it css i call it styles
16:29 - sorry about that everyone
16:31 - my fault there we go now it works okay
16:35 - great
16:36 - um
16:38 - all right so now whatever styles we end
16:39 - up putting in our faculty.css
16:43 - uh will automatically be reflected here
16:46 - okay wonderful
16:49 - all right so here's i
16:50 - wha how we want this page to look
16:55 - let's kind of move this about here
17:01 - uh so this title
17:03 - we'll want this to be much larger so i
17:05 - guess let's start at the top and and
17:07 - work our way down from there
17:09 - so
17:11 - name is
17:13 - the name of this tag let's see what we
17:15 - want
17:17 - we definitely want
17:19 - let's see
17:24 - all right let's take this root
17:28 - details
17:42 - all right so i definitely know i want a
17:44 - different font as well so let's just do
17:46 - this on main
17:53 - we're going to do
17:55 - font family
17:56 - and
17:59 - roboto
18:00 - and
18:05 - sans serif as a backup
18:10 - and
18:13 - there we go
18:15 - all right so we got the font we want
18:18 - now let's work on our
18:24 - title
18:28 - all right sorry our name
18:31 - all right so let's do font size
18:35 - um what do we want let's try 24 pixels
18:38 - see how that looks
18:39 - okay i like that 24 looks good
18:42 - this is going to be pretty experimental
18:44 - as well um as we're going through since
18:47 - we have to work with
18:48 - an html structure that we didn't create
18:50 - ourselves
18:52 - we're just going to have to try some
18:53 - things out which i think is kind of fun
18:55 - it's not the fastest way to do things
18:57 - but
18:58 - it is interesting
19:00 - all right so let's let's throw this in
19:02 - uh under
19:04 - our name
19:06 - and
19:15 - one good thing about this is all these
19:17 - custom html tags are named
19:20 - you know very nicely it makes sense the
19:22 - way they're named
19:23 - we probably should have this in some
19:25 - sort of container
19:27 - so
19:30 - let's see
19:43 - let's see what container class we're
19:44 - using here
19:48 - i assume we're using something here
19:51 - all right let's check it out
19:55 - um
19:56 - where are we at
20:06 - index
20:13 - all right yeah let's put in a grid
20:14 - container in here
20:28 - actually i went for the entire thing
20:37 - yeah we'll start out with a grid
20:38 - container
20:41 - we will need to pull this in i assume
20:43 - grid
20:47 - so
20:48 - sorry i said i wasn't going to do too
20:50 - much with react but
20:52 - i guess we will be doing a bit with
20:54 - react
21:05 - uh so all this is gonna do what it
21:07 - should do is give us some nicer margins
21:12 - and i believe it made them worse
21:16 - okay
21:18 - i think maybe we'll need to wrap this in
21:20 - some grid items as well
21:41 - yeah let's try putting this in a good
21:42 - item you know what
21:44 - i think we did have some inline styles
21:46 - though
21:49 - did we
22:06 - all right
22:07 - let's let's go back to our css for now
22:13 - and
22:15 - well let's do this first
22:22 - are we getting this
22:27 - expected a different indentation
22:30 - all right there we go
22:31 - um
22:33 - let's go
22:35 - red
22:37 - item
22:40 - i thought it was great item
22:44 - okay it's like this
22:53 - and
22:56 - there we go so for for those of you who
22:59 - are interested in
23:00 - your kind of why we're doing this in
23:03 - react
23:05 - we're using materialize or i'm sorry
23:08 - material ui
23:10 - the beta version of material ui
23:12 - for these components and
23:17 - let's see
23:18 - i've messed something up
23:22 - let's see
23:23 - see how bad it messed it up
23:25 - okay not terribly
23:28 - but why am i doing this now
23:39 - oh no i guess those are just the regular
23:41 - colors
23:43 - i'm not used to this color scheme it was
23:45 - supposed to be the same color scheme i
23:46 - used for adam
23:48 - but i think there are some differences
23:52 - um
23:54 - there we go
23:58 - how harsh it's saying in the live chat
24:00 - to use format on save
24:03 - i will i will use that i don't since i
24:06 - don't have a lot of time on this stream
24:07 - i'll i'm not going to switch it right
24:09 - now but
24:10 - i will
24:12 - use that later on
24:14 - okay so
24:17 - that little distraction i had with using
24:19 - grid actually didn't do anything
24:25 - um
24:26 - but
24:27 - let's see
24:30 - i guess
24:52 - i guess it's okay for now
25:05 - okay
25:07 - all right so let's look at what else we
25:09 - have here
25:10 - i do want to put
25:13 - i want to find the
25:15 - container i guess this would be it this
25:20 - this container here for the test
25:22 - or even maine
25:28 - i suppose we could do it on main
25:32 - all right so let's go to our our main
25:34 - here and
25:36 - try to put in
25:40 - a let me think
25:45 - i need
25:46 - margin
25:48 - need some sort of padding or margin
25:51 - maybe i don't want to do it on main
25:53 - let's just do it on this content div
26:03 - margin
26:05 - and we just want
26:07 - 16
26:08 - pixels all right that's fine for now i
26:11 - just wanted to get it off of the very
26:12 - edge of the page
26:15 - where i'm going to have to think up some
26:16 - other way but i'd like to maybe do it
26:18 - within this grid
26:20 - system
26:22 - i also have to check out the
26:23 - documentation i suppose
26:25 - but i don't want to get into it right
26:27 - now because i've said that this is going
26:28 - to be you know mostly regular html css
26:32 - and that would be getting into more of
26:34 - the material ui
26:38 - react components so i don't want to get
26:40 - into that right now
26:42 - so let's just do this on our css
26:45 - so we're going to make
26:49 - actually
26:50 - let's get rid of that we'll have more
26:52 - room and i can make this a bit bigger
26:54 - okay so
26:56 - i'm not going to do it on the main let's
26:58 - do it
27:00 - right there
27:02 - and then
27:05 - let me just do
27:10 - and i want to do its
27:13 - data test id content
27:17 - okay
27:23 - how do we do this
27:26 - oh you know what it's not like that it's
27:27 - like this
27:30 - all right so we're gonna put in brackets
27:31 - and we're gonna say
27:34 - um
27:35 - what was that called again data test id
27:47 - all right so this should select that
27:49 - i think
27:51 - let's see if it does
28:00 - interesting um
28:03 - i think it's just doing that because i
28:04 - haven't put anything in here
28:06 - uh and we're gonna add that margin
28:09 - 16 pixels
28:12 - there we go
28:13 - so let me make sure that this worked
28:14 - before i try to explain what's going on
28:16 - i don't want to explain something that's
28:17 - wrong let's do a refresh here yep that
28:20 - looks good
28:22 - so what i've done here is
28:26 - i've selected div you know the divs but
28:29 - i want a specific div so i only want the
28:31 - divs
28:32 - where it has an attribute of data test
28:34 - id
28:36 - and that attribute equals content so if
28:38 - you ever have an
28:41 - html element
28:43 - that has
28:44 - some type of custom
28:46 - attribute you can grab that attribute
28:49 - use it to select that div
28:53 - and
28:55 - and grab pretty much anything you know
28:56 - any custom attribute so that's kind of
28:58 - useful
28:59 - uh
29:01 - the syntax is maybe a little bit
29:03 - different than you normally use but you
29:05 - know it could be like i said it could be
29:06 - with anything the only thing you do you
29:08 - use these square brackets
29:10 - uh the first item you just type it out
29:13 - as normal equals and then the second
29:14 - part after the equal sign is you're
29:17 - going to want to put that in single or
29:18 - double quotes
29:22 - all right
29:23 - so now we can move on
29:26 - and i think
29:28 - i don't mind it being
29:38 - i don't mind it being like this on a
29:41 - small screen but on a large screen i'd
29:43 - very much like to take up more space and
29:45 - kind of have things side by side
29:47 - uh so i'm okay with the name and the
29:50 - picture being here
29:52 - um but then maybe let's let's move
29:55 - this other data up
29:57 - and uh make it
29:59 - kind of a whole another another column
30:02 - you know if we can
30:12 - all right so first let's inspect this
30:18 - and
30:20 - let's figure out if we have
30:24 - something that kind of goes around the
30:26 - whole thing
30:28 - i don't know that we do
30:30 - hmm
30:31 - well that root component goes around
30:33 - quite a lot of it
30:47 - let's do that then let's put the root
30:50 - component we'll keep it
30:53 - that's that's actually really weird
30:57 - that's that's very odd how it how it was
31:00 - assembled in there
31:02 - um
31:04 - education
31:05 - because the title for this section
31:10 - is within that root component but then
31:12 - the data for that the rest of the
31:14 - content for that section is down here
31:16 - outside of it
31:19 - all right this is some interesting
31:22 - markup here
31:26 - it's it's going to be a little bit more
31:27 - difficult to do what i want
31:30 - i'm not sure what this f is just hanging
31:31 - out here
31:36 - what is this f
31:47 - well i guess we'll we'll figure out
31:49 - where it's from
31:51 - at some point and get rid of it
31:58 - there we go details type
32:01 - f all right let's get rid of that as
32:03 - well so we're going to want details type
32:06 - to display none
32:12 - um let's just add it on here
32:19 - so if you're doing you know css and you
32:22 - want to apply the same styles to more
32:24 - than one element
32:26 - you can do that just with a comma
32:28 - and a space in between
32:30 - so we should if we refresh
32:34 - we shouldn't see that f anymore great so
32:36 - we don't see that f okay
32:41 - again if you didn't uh if you weren't
32:42 - here from the beginning
32:44 - um
32:45 - we didn't create this html we're kind of
32:47 - stuck with it at first
32:49 - um so
32:51 - that's why we're we're kind of doing
32:53 - some weird things here but
32:55 - realistically on the job
32:58 - you may get stuck with some markup that
33:00 - you have no control over and you just
33:02 - have to do the best you can with what
33:03 - you've been given that's happened to me
33:05 - quite a lot
33:06 - uh as a front-end developer so
33:11 - i know it would be better if we could do
33:13 - it differently and change the markup but
33:15 - you can't always do that
33:17 - okay so now let's take
33:21 - hmm
33:30 - cv link
33:32 - interesting
33:39 - not exactly the best title
33:43 - we may have to come up with some
33:45 - creative way to
33:48 - change this
33:50 - i'm going to think about that um
33:53 - right here this is a link to you know
33:55 - curriculum vitae uh pdf i hope it's a
33:58 - pdf it is uh but you wouldn't really
34:02 - know that
34:03 - right off the bat
34:05 - so we're gonna need to add something in
34:06 - here
34:09 - and maybe change the title
34:17 - okay
34:18 - so
34:20 - this phone number
34:23 - i want it up closer to the picture
34:27 - so hopefully it's in yes
34:31 - no right we can't
34:34 - can't do that
34:38 - i think we're just gonna have to bring
34:41 - everything over huh
35:08 - hmm
35:14 - all right new plan
35:17 - let's try to get it to where all these
35:19 - details are automatically open and see
35:21 - how much we're dealing with before i
35:23 - decide on what columns we're using
35:27 - um so you can see
35:29 - in this case we do have quite a lot
35:31 - of information
35:35 - so let's let's work with that first
35:38 - the markup
35:39 - it's just making it a little difficult
35:41 - to really do the columns the way i want
35:45 - so we we still may be able to do it
35:52 - but i'd rather do
35:54 - do something first that i know
35:58 - needs done
36:00 - all right so wow these details
36:03 - what changes
36:22 - so as long as they have open on them
36:25 - it's okay
36:27 - i guess
36:32 - so we're gonna need some
36:39 - hmm
36:51 - i need to change this
37:04 - okay uh harsh it
37:06 - sorry i just um i just saw that i you
37:09 - are talking about using ngrok
37:11 - yeah let's get ngrok up and running let
37:13 - me find my terminal
37:21 - where's my terminal
37:27 - i thought i had ngrok open already i
37:29 - guess i didn't
37:37 - okay
37:38 - um
37:45 - shoot i can't remember
37:48 - how's
37:56 - there we go
38:05 - nope it's not
38:07 - http
38:10 - 3000
38:12 - okay
38:15 - all right i'm going to paste the link
38:16 - here into the live chat if you follow
38:19 - that link you'll be able to see what i'm
38:21 - seeing
38:23 - so you'll you'll want to go i'm going to
38:25 - paste in the
38:30 - where i'm at
38:32 - um
38:33 - so
38:35 - after ngrok
38:37 - after the the ngrok.io part you're going
38:40 - to want to add what i've just pasted in
38:42 - as well so slash faculty
38:44 - slash haney hyphen eric
38:48 - so you just copy and paste it right
38:50 - there
38:54 - all right so i think the best thing to
38:57 - do now would be to add some logic
39:00 - in our component
39:04 - sorry for the yawn
39:08 - okay
39:10 - and my timer is up and i have no idea
39:12 - how long it's been up i um
39:15 - i was focused and i didn't even hear it
39:21 - okay i will take a short break now and
39:23 - go to the live chat see what questions
39:25 - are there and then we'll continue on
39:27 - after that
39:29 - and we may need to cut the second
39:31 - session short
39:33 - second code session short since we went
39:35 - long on the first one i'm gonna scroll
39:37 - all the way up to the top of the live
39:38 - chat and uh just get it to as many
39:40 - questions as i can
39:48 - uh
39:49 - manoj says
39:51 - should i and sorry if i mispronounced
39:53 - that please let me know how to pronounce
39:55 - it properly
39:56 - so should i learn js or ts i'm assuming
39:59 - javascript or typescript
40:01 - um
40:02 - if you're gonna go for something first
40:05 - uh
40:07 - i would learn javascript first
40:10 - but i i have no experience at all with
40:12 - with typescript so
40:14 - you may want to talk to somebody who
40:16 - uses typescript
40:17 - to get another opinion on that
40:24 - let's see
40:33 - uh no beer said in response to that uh
40:36 - you can learn typescript because
40:37 - typescript has some advanced program
40:39 - that can convert into javascript
40:41 - so that that's cool
40:43 - the the only thing i would say to that i
40:45 - guess is um
40:47 - since javascript is way more widely used
40:49 - in typescript
40:51 - knowing javascript will help you to be
40:54 - able to read other people's code and
40:56 - contribute to their code base more
40:59 - easily
41:00 - so it does kind of depend on what kind
41:01 - of work you see yourself doing if it's
41:03 - all new stuff or you kind of have
41:05 - control over what goes into it then you
41:07 - know use whatever you want
41:09 - but if you'd like to get involved in
41:11 - existing projects
41:14 - javascript might be better for you
41:26 - uh unidos says i'm a i'm from developer
41:29 - from brazil and other countries do they
41:30 - accept foreign as well
41:32 - i don't i mean it just depends on the
41:34 - country uh and on the place so like i'm
41:36 - from the united states uh even within
41:39 - the united states it would depend on
41:40 - where you are within the country as to
41:43 - whether or not foreigners are accepted
41:44 - well uh there are some areas of the
41:46 - country where they're very you know
41:48 - accepted in other areas of the country
41:50 - where you know not so much
41:52 - uh and i imagine other countries are the
41:54 - same it just it just kind of depends on
41:57 - on where you're at so it's kind of a
41:58 - difficult question to answer like you
42:00 - know in general across the board
42:04 - but uh even in you know in my uh
42:07 - university where i work we do have some
42:09 - employees
42:10 - who have come from other countries just
42:13 - you know to work here and as far as i
42:15 - know they
42:16 - you know everything's going pretty well
42:18 - for him i'm not i don't know about you
42:20 - know the outside of of the workplace how
42:23 - things go for them but
42:25 - um
42:26 - at least within the workplace
42:27 - you know the university that i work for
42:29 - is pretty open to that
42:39 - um menno says very confused between
42:42 - angular react and view
42:44 - um
42:46 - i
42:51 - i guess
42:52 - there are definite differences i i don't
42:54 - really think i can i can really do a
42:56 - great job of explaining all the
42:57 - differences to you
43:00 - but i think the best way to really get a
43:02 - good idea is to do like the basic hello
43:05 - world example for react angular and view
43:09 - it shouldn't take you too long
43:11 - and then you'll get at least a little
43:13 - idea of what each one is like
43:16 - you certainly won't be anywhere near
43:18 - experienced in in any of them
43:21 - uh but
43:22 - maybe you just kind of see
43:25 - what it's like and then maybe watch some
43:27 - videos of people doing something a
43:29 - little bit more advanced with each one
43:32 - uh that way you don't have to spend a
43:33 - ton of time learning you know before you
43:35 - make your decision but you might be able
43:37 - to make a more informed decision on
43:39 - which one you'd like to learn more
43:41 - last question uh no beer asks why don't
43:44 - you use sass i think that's very logical
43:46 - for styling dom
43:49 - and it looks like
43:50 - rhaegal already says he said the answer
43:53 - but basically it's i just didn't have
43:55 - sas set up yet
43:57 - so for sash you need to be able to
43:59 - you know compile that into regular
44:02 - css so
44:04 - once i get that set up i would much
44:06 - rather use sas i prefer that but at
44:08 - least for now we're just doing regular
44:10 - css
44:11 - okay so i'm gonna make a note of where
44:14 - i've left off at
44:16 - and we're gonna do
44:19 - some more coding
44:25 - so here's what i'm going to do
44:27 - since i have a lot in the live chat i'm
44:29 - going to plan on
44:31 - taking a good bit of time
44:33 - to
44:34 - to answer the questions so this next
44:37 - session i'm just going to do a 10 minute
44:39 - session for coding and then see where we
44:41 - are
44:42 - uh harshit says it looked like
44:44 - engroc has crashed
44:53 - crashed
44:55 - i'm not sure i'm seeing
44:57 - let me let me uh
44:59 - check this as well
45:01 - because i'm seeing a lot of activity
45:03 - you know looking like it didn't crash
45:05 - but
45:07 - let's see
45:09 - okay it's still working for me
45:22 - yeah okay it's still working for me so i
45:24 - don't maybe um
45:26 - try to refresh the browser or go back to
45:29 - it
45:30 - i did go to a faculty page
45:33 - and it worked
45:35 - make sure
45:38 - everything's spelled correctly
45:55 - so let me i'm gonna paste the complete
45:57 - link in right now
46:00 - so this link right now is working for me
46:04 - no it's not when i click from within
46:06 - there it doesn't work
46:08 - interesting
46:14 - what's the difference
46:21 - that's odd
46:23 - that's really odd
46:39 - all right i just typed in the faculty
46:42 - member's name
46:43 - and and see if you can just copy and
46:46 - paste that in because for some reason it
46:48 - doesn't work with the link but it does
46:50 - work
46:52 - when i type it in manually
46:57 - so
46:58 - i don't know
46:59 - all right
47:02 - orson says maybe it's because we're
47:04 - using the development build right now
47:06 - yeah it's entirely possible uh that
47:09 - that's that's why it's not working
47:12 - okay so let's get a bit more done here
47:17 - and
47:19 - okay so we want to get these details
47:24 - few i've actually never used the details
47:27 - uh html element
47:30 - this is the first time i've ever seen it
47:33 - so
47:36 - i'm not sure
47:40 - it looks like there is some default
47:41 - activity here in that it automatically
47:44 - shows details
47:46 - and it automatically has this open close
47:49 - action going on
47:51 - so we really don't want that
47:55 - i don't think there's
47:57 - that much data that we really need the
47:59 - open and close stuff going on
48:01 - so
48:03 - actually this one might be long
48:07 - yeah that might be a bit longer but
48:11 - and that's that's going to need some
48:13 - work on the formatting
48:15 - but for now at least let's
48:19 - let's change these details
48:21 - uh and everywhere we have a details tag
48:25 - we need to change that
48:29 - i guess just to a div
48:32 - let's give it a div with the class
48:37 - um
48:42 - i i thought we maybe could give it a
48:43 - class details but now that i think about
48:45 - it
48:46 - we really don't even need that
48:50 - okay rook rook says so it's a basic html
48:53 - element thanks yeah that's uh the more i
48:56 - look at it the more i i think it's got
48:58 - to be a basic html element
49:00 - right so
49:04 - i like i said i've never seen it before
49:06 - but it that's how it behaves
49:09 - so unfortunately i don't think we're
49:11 - going to be able to use css for this one
49:14 - we're going to have to use a little bit
49:15 - of javascript
49:19 - so let's see
49:21 - let's go back to our component here our
49:24 - faculty.js component
49:26 - and
49:28 - let's see what we can do
49:38 - so this is all going to come to us as a
49:40 - string
49:44 - right
49:46 - yeah it's all going to be a string
49:49 - let's see
49:51 - if we can
49:56 - if we can do something so let's say um
50:06 - format content
50:13 - all right so
50:15 - let me do a bit of
50:19 - javascript here
50:21 - so what we've done here we're just going
50:23 - to make a function here and we're using
50:25 - an arrow function okay and that's
50:27 - because we want to have proper access to
50:30 - the word this
50:31 - uh in here
50:32 - so
50:36 - let's go within here we're gonna want to
50:39 - grab this data
50:44 - now within here we already have we've
50:46 - already grabbed this props but we don't
50:48 - do it outside of here so we need to
50:50 - start with this props
50:52 - um
51:02 - start um
51:12 - okay
51:13 - and
51:16 - isaiah is asking can anyone see my my
51:18 - chat uh isaiah i do i see your chat
51:27 - okay
51:28 - do it in render
51:32 - okay harsh is saying you can use a
51:34 - regular expression to do it in render
51:38 - um that's true i was kind of thinking
51:40 - that we may have some other things that
51:42 - we want to change so i would just make
51:45 - this uh function be where we make all
51:48 - those
51:48 - changes but i'm certainly open to other
51:51 - ideas
51:52 - uh also i was gonna do like a you know
51:56 - like a fine
51:57 - because i'm not great with regular
51:59 - expressions
52:02 - but
52:02 - at some point we could certainly change
52:04 - it if it would make the code more
52:05 - concise
52:09 - uh let's see stator factory edge is not
52:16 - content we're going to want to
52:19 - let's see
52:40 - okay um rook work pasted some helpful
52:44 - information from mdn which is the
52:46 - mozilla developer network
52:48 - uh i'm going to read this out just since
52:51 - you know we were talking about what kind
52:52 - of tag that details tag was it says
52:54 - details is used to create a disclosure
52:57 - widget in which information is visible
53:00 - only when the widget is toggled into an
53:02 - open state a summary or label can be
53:05 - provided using the summary element
53:09 - interesting
53:11 - interesting
53:14 - okay
53:20 - uh let's see
53:33 - i got i'm gonna have to look up uh
53:35 - the syntax on replace
53:41 - i can't even remember the last time i
53:43 - used it
53:45 - all right
53:47 - so let's go
53:49 - all right so dot replace it looks like
53:51 - the first thing
53:52 - the first string is what we are looking
53:54 - for in the second one is what we want to
53:56 - replace what if we want to do multiple
53:58 - things at once can we do that
54:29 - all right um well i don't want double
54:31 - quotes i'm not thinking all right let's
54:33 - go with
54:34 - um
54:35 - actually can do this
54:37 - let's say
54:41 - what did we want details
54:50 - yeah we want to replace details
54:53 - um
54:54 - globally so we want to get all of the
54:56 - details replaced and we want to replace
54:59 - that with
55:01 - div
55:03 - and let's just say class
55:07 - equals
55:14 - double quotes here
55:17 - class equals details that way um
55:21 - i'll be able to tell which which ones
55:23 - we've actually changed like that easily
55:27 - let's see if that'll work don't do this
55:29 - alright what about closing tag
55:34 - yeah hardship that's what
55:37 - yeah the closing tag will be missed so
55:39 - that's why i was asking if we could do
55:41 - two things at once otherwise i'm just
55:43 - gonna have to do content replace twice
55:45 - in a row
55:50 - so it looks like in the documentation
55:52 - i'm not seeing
55:54 - let's see
55:55 - blue house car
56:01 - oh here we go
56:02 - we can do
56:05 - i know we can't
56:11 - i'm not seeing a way that i could
56:14 - i can get multiple things and replace
56:16 - them all with the same thing but i'm not
56:18 - seeing in documentation where i can
56:22 - um get
56:25 - multiple things and then replace them
56:28 - with multiple things
56:44 - so i mean potentially
56:48 - potentially we could do this
57:07 - oh no this is not gonna be good we need
57:08 - to escape that how do we escape
57:15 - okay
57:16 - harsh it's um
57:18 - has some code that
57:21 - that may work here so let's check that
57:23 - out
57:26 - um if you're
57:28 - haven't haven't watched uh before um
57:31 - harshit here is a member of the
57:33 - community he watches the streams and
57:35 - contributes quite a bit of really good
57:37 - code so
57:39 - when i say harsh it that's what uh
57:41 - that's who i'm talking about
57:44 - uh so i'm gonna check
57:46 - what he has going on here
57:57 - okay our i see what you've done the
58:00 - only problem i have with that though is
58:02 - what if the word details
58:05 - is also contained in there and i don't
58:08 - want to change the word details that's
58:10 - why i've added in
58:13 - you know this
58:15 - and as well as this one
58:21 - the thing is though i'm going to need
58:25 - to escape that
58:32 - so let me i'll bring this over quickly
58:35 - just to see
58:37 - so
58:38 - so hardships will definitely work
58:40 - a harshit solution here so we're
58:42 - replacing all instances of details with
58:45 - div
58:46 - but what i'm saying is what
58:48 - if you know what if in here
58:51 - in in these paragraphs
58:54 - what if the word details was inside of
58:56 - here that would then get replaced with
58:58 - div and we certainly don't want that
59:11 - okay
59:13 - we're probably going to wrap this up
59:14 - soon i just got a notification that my
59:16 - meeting is in 30 minutes i do have to
59:18 - walk somewhere else on campus so i need
59:20 - to allow for time for that
59:33 - okay
59:33 - um so let me let's go back
59:36 - uh to whoops my timer did go off
59:40 - all right you know what i'm i'm gonna go
59:41 - to live chat because i promised earlier
59:43 - that i'll get through all the questions
59:44 - in the live chat so
59:46 - harsha said uh that he's gonna work on
59:49 - this
59:50 - um
59:51 - what we were just working on here
59:54 - to be able to make sure that it replaces
59:56 - only the detail tags and nothing else
60:00 - so
60:01 - okay harsh it says it's fixed so let me
60:03 - check that out now okay wonderful
60:06 - wonderful
60:07 - all right so let's
60:09 - let's use this now
60:13 - i'm going to copy and paste here what
60:14 - what hardship has done
60:18 - um hardship i'm just doing it like that
60:20 - because that's definitely going to be a
60:21 - lot faster than um
60:24 - uh the pull requests
60:25 - been merging the pull requests as
60:28 - expected
60:29 - what did i do wrong did i put this in
60:31 - the wrong spot
60:43 - no i didn't
60:44 - i did not put in the wrong spot
60:46 - maybe i just don't
60:52 - properly
60:57 - okay so it looks like a
61:00 - double quote there we go so we needed
61:02 - one more double quotes
61:06 - okay wonderful
61:10 - eagle i forgot an equals
61:12 - thanks harshit
61:14 - like why
61:16 - oh well
61:17 - sometimes that happens stuff you do all
61:19 - the time and it's just like
61:22 - you forget so why are what's it saying
61:24 - now i expected a comma somewhere
61:37 - oh and it's expecting
61:40 - that
61:42 - a space is required after comma
61:46 - there we go all right
61:48 - great
61:50 - uh data is not defined
61:53 - content is assigned a value but never
61:56 - used
61:57 - uh okay
62:05 - okay i see how harsh it also did this a
62:07 - bit differently so
62:08 - um
62:10 - let's see
62:20 - so
62:21 - i should put this
62:24 - here
62:26 - so let's do that
62:30 - this is the last thing we'll do
62:33 - and then we'll finish up
62:40 - okay
62:42 - so
62:43 - if you're not familiar with const uh
62:45 - it's the same
62:47 - it fulfills the same function in this
62:49 - case as if we were to use their var
62:53 - um
62:54 - so i'm not going to get into the details
62:55 - of what's different about const but
62:57 - uh that's basically what we're doing
62:59 - we're just declaring a variable
63:02 - and now we're taking that data we had
63:04 - before but now we're replacing some of
63:07 - the bits of data and putting in some
63:08 - some different things
63:11 - so now we don't need this anymore
63:17 - uh so that's nice that that got rid of
63:19 - um a lot of
63:22 - extra lines that we didn't need way to
63:25 - say constant sound value
63:27 - yeah and we need
63:29 - data oh okay are we inside we're not
63:32 - inside the render anymore are we no
63:34 - we're not so
63:40 - crazy
63:52 - not here you're not there not there it
63:54 - won't work so harsh is saying it won't
63:56 - work
63:57 - so things have changed oh yeah return
64:00 - change
64:02 - i need to see this file
64:04 - the whole file it's not showing me the
64:06 - whole file right now what i'm looking at
64:09 - faculty render return layout
64:12 - oh okay i see
64:14 - so harsh it has changed more
64:18 - um
64:19 - than what we originally had
64:24 - absolutely
64:29 - oh i see i see what i messed up
64:36 - that was the first that's what messed me
64:38 - up i just saw a layout and uh and that
64:41 - okay
64:45 - the details too okay
64:48 - of course
64:49 - all right wonderful
64:58 - and then within this
65:01 - we just need to put
65:03 - content
65:06 - all right let's check that out
65:10 - no
65:11 - oops did i forget
65:14 - an equals i did
65:19 - all right
65:25 - great
65:26 - all right so
65:28 - hmm
65:32 - um you know what
65:48 - i don't think it works
66:14 - this has to be a casting caching issue
66:27 - hmm
66:32 - uh let me try a different faculty member
66:41 - oh okay harsh is saying it's detail okay
66:45 - it's detail and not details
66:48 - okay
66:53 - there we go
67:04 - come on
67:22 - oops
67:28 - well if it is caching i know it'll fix
67:30 - it
67:37 - let's just restart the server
67:45 - okay that'll be the last thing i try and
67:47 - then i i've got to get to the questions
67:49 - or i'll never get through them all
67:56 - hmm
68:03 - it's very odd
68:17 - oh wait a sec it is details within us
68:36 - so actually we were right before it was
68:38 - details with an s
68:43 - so let me save that and refresh
68:47 - and
68:52 - uh
68:54 - let's go with a different faculty member
68:57 - uh let's try
69:00 - we'll try someone different they're
69:02 - they're not gonna have a um
69:07 - let's see
69:09 - they're not gonna have a an image
69:11 - because i didn't change it for anyone
69:12 - else let's try one that's easy okay
69:16 - walker
69:18 - john that's easy to spell
69:21 - no it's still the same
69:25 - details
69:28 - okay i've got to stop with with this i
69:30 - got to get to the live chat so i'm going
69:32 - to have to go fast as it is
69:38 - all right so let me scroll up to where i
69:39 - left off so
69:41 - uh if you are new
69:43 - this happens
69:44 - i don't know if i'd say frequently but
69:46 - it happens
69:48 - regularly that uh we in fact don't
69:53 - get done what we wanted to get done
69:54 - which is fine because this is supposed
69:56 - to be a portrayal of
69:58 - an accurate portrayal of my work as a
70:00 - front-end developer and things don't
70:01 - always work out
70:03 - the way that i expect them to
70:06 - so this will work out at some point
70:08 - we'll just have it'll just take longer
70:09 - than i thought
70:11 - so unfortunately we won't be able to
70:12 - solve it on today's stream but
70:15 - i'll certainly
70:16 - if we figure it out before tomorrow's
70:18 - stream i'll i'll certainly explain it to
70:20 - everyone tomorrow
70:22 - all right so
70:23 - i'm gonna do my best to get through this
70:25 - all these questions
70:28 - uh if i happen to not get to your
70:29 - question or i miss it just ask me the
70:31 - same question in the comments below uh
70:33 - this video or you can send me the
70:35 - question on twitter and i'll be happy to
70:37 - answer later on
70:41 - okay
70:42 - uh reijan asks which software i'm using
70:44 - i'm using visual studio code
70:54 - let's see
71:00 - jewel says hello hey how's it going
71:03 - thanks for watching
71:05 - uh
71:07 - let's see
71:16 - um no brs is is it free open source a
71:20 - visual studio code is is free
71:52 - uh someone says uh i should go now why
71:55 - is it so boring um
71:57 - coding is actually really cool so i
71:59 - apologize if the stream is boring it's
72:01 - probably entirely my fault so uh
72:05 - don't don't blame the code blame me
72:09 - if you'd like to give me some uh some
72:11 - helpful tips you know some helpful
72:13 - advice on how i can make this more
72:15 - exciting uh please let me know i'm
72:18 - always trying to improve
72:24 - uh andrew davis says is grid hard to
72:27 - learn i'm having trouble understanding
72:29 - how it works
72:30 - um no beer says nope uh it's easy but
72:33 - you have to practice it more and more
72:37 - cool and i i don't think i can improve
72:39 - on that that answer that's you know
72:40 - that's perfect um
72:44 - as long as you practice it
72:46 - it'll become like second nature and
72:47 - you'll be able to use it
72:51 - you'll be able to use it easily
73:07 - g streak says the reason i don't watch
73:09 - live streams
73:11 - i'm assuming i messed something up at
73:12 - that point i don't remember what was
73:14 - going on then but uh
73:18 - yeah things do get messed up if that in
73:20 - fact was the case
73:22 - if that's the reason then yeah it
73:24 - happens you can't there's no editing on
73:26 - live streams things break things don't
73:28 - work and you know you just gotta work
73:30 - through it but that's in a sense the
73:32 - point of this live stream is
73:34 - the value in it is seeing things break
73:36 - and seeing how we work through it
73:51 - okay no beer said uh when we use the css
73:56 - we did not actually need the quotes
73:58 - around content so i was mistaken i i
74:03 - i guess i've always thought that was
74:04 - necessary
74:05 - uh
74:06 - i was mistaken on that so i guess you
74:08 - don't need you don't need that so thanks
74:10 - for that no beer i appreciate you
74:12 - pointing that out
74:15 - ah john hanson said yes he's going to
74:17 - bring in the important i can feel it i
74:19 - didn't have to bring it important well
74:21 - not yet at least
74:22 - i'm sure it will happen later on
74:41 - uh
74:42 - a studio s how many days a week do you
74:44 - live stream i try to do five but
74:46 - sometimes things happen like i meetings
74:48 - or other things
74:49 - so i don't always get five days a week
74:52 - but i do try monday through friday
74:55 - yesterday i didn't get a chance to
74:57 - stream uh that was because we had
74:58 - someone else streaming so uh go ahead
75:00 - and check that out i think it was uh
75:02 - ethan uh was live streaming so
75:05 - uh sorry about not streaming but it was
75:06 - kind of in that same time period where i
75:08 - normally stream and um
75:11 - so
75:12 - you know i just kind of
75:14 - watched his stream and uh commented on
75:16 - there and
75:19 - so
75:20 - we're going to do a better job of trying
75:21 - to coordinate stream time so hopefully
75:23 - we won't both try to stream at the same
75:25 - time
75:30 - uh products geek says what do you use to
75:33 - make the drop down i'm assuming you're
75:35 - talking about these drop downs here in
75:36 - the details and
75:39 - this is just an html element if you use
75:42 - the details element it automatically
75:44 - creates this for you
75:47 - which i just learned today so
75:50 - it seems pretty useful if you're trying
75:52 - to keep the site you know kind of really
75:54 - light
75:58 - uh let's see
75:59 - isaiah says hi hey my name is jose i'm
76:02 - 14 years old
76:03 - uh if you want to check out my code pen
76:06 - it's isaiah ct
76:08 - i'm wondering what projects i can make i
76:10 - finished the port i know html css js and
76:13 - basic ruby and python this is my
76:15 - portfolio
76:17 - um let's see
76:22 - this is darno okay so uh must not have
76:24 - let isaiah it usually doesn't let you
76:27 - put in um urls if you put some spaces in
76:31 - the url usually it works
76:33 - if you want me to see your portfolio
76:35 - feel free to direct message me on
76:36 - twitter
76:38 - or you could just you know tag me in
76:40 - twitter
76:41 - uh with the link to your portfolio i'd
76:43 - be happy to check it out
76:48 - uh the question is what's the best way
76:50 - for me to be able to get my stuff seen
76:52 - um
76:57 - it's i guess it's tough to get your own
76:59 - project scene out there unless you kind
77:00 - of directly send it to different
77:02 - companies as you know check out my
77:03 - portfolio i'm looking for internships or
77:05 - jobs or whatever uh otherwise um you
77:09 - could
77:09 - consider contributing to open source
77:11 - projects and then that way um you know
77:14 - your your github profile
77:16 - will grow right and your name will be
77:18 - out there for in these other projects
77:20 - that people already look at a lot so
77:22 - that's a good way to do it as well
77:31 - um isaiah says where's the best place to
77:34 - learn to make servers
77:37 - um
77:42 - you know what i i don't know that i'm
77:44 - the best to answer that um
77:47 - because i mainly do front end
77:49 - uh so some of the back end people what
77:51 - resources do you recommend for isaiah uh
77:54 - to be able to learn more about about
77:56 - servers
77:57 - if you know any resources let me know
78:00 - i wish i could answer that question
78:01 - better but
78:03 - i guess i'm running out of time so maybe
78:05 - if i had a little bit more time to think
78:06 - about it
78:08 - i could come up with something but like
78:10 - i said uh usually if i have to do
78:13 - anything with a server i look up the
78:14 - documentation on digitalocean they have
78:16 - good documentation
78:18 - and i just follow the instructions
78:27 - isaiah says do you have any insight of
78:29 - the new courses coming to free code camp
78:31 - my 14 year old brain needs more um
78:34 - i haven't seen that much of the new
78:36 - stuff but from what i've seen it looks
78:37 - really good
78:39 - so i'm excited about it i think i'm
78:42 - going to try some of the new stuff out
78:43 - when it does come out as far as i know
78:45 - it's supposed to come out around
78:47 - christmas time
78:48 - so sometime at the end of this month
78:50 - hopefully it's on schedule
78:52 - um but
78:54 - as far as specifics i don't really know
78:56 - a lot of specifics uh i know there's
78:58 - going to be some ex6 stuff in there
79:01 - i'm sorry es6 in there
79:05 - um
79:06 - there'll be some more react stuff uh
79:10 - some stuff with sas so
79:12 - that's all i know for sure
79:15 - you can of course check out all the new
79:17 - stuff already if you want to um you know
79:20 - check out the free code camp github uh
79:24 - repositories
79:26 - and you could see it all we can even
79:28 - contribute if you'd like
79:33 - all right constantine asked is that a
79:35 - valid way to declare a function no it
79:37 - wasn't a valid way i just for some
79:39 - reason completely forgot the right way
79:41 - to do an arrow function even though
79:43 - we use them here all the time on the
79:45 - stream so oh you know what i took it out
79:47 - so sorry but anyway that yeah that in
79:49 - fact was the wrong way to do it
80:16 - uh let's see
80:19 - duncan says uh may i request live coding
80:22 - in java
80:23 - uh i would not be the one to be able to
80:25 - do live coding in java because my java
80:28 - skills are
80:30 - limited to like a one day course that i
80:32 - took at some point where we like kind of
80:35 - made a game and that was years ago so i
80:37 - don't remember any of it
80:38 - um
80:40 - so if someone else
80:42 - has some java skills and would like to
80:43 - live stream you know maybe get in
80:45 - contact with quincy uh maybe on twitter
80:48 - or something or send him an email
80:51 - with maybe some examples of your live
80:53 - coding uh which you've done before and
80:56 - maybe he might be interested i don't
80:57 - really make those decisions it's more up
80:59 - to quincy so i i can't say one way or
81:02 - another whether
81:03 - um whether you'd be able to do it i just
81:05 - you know encourage you to
81:07 - you know do some live coding on your own
81:09 - and then you know share it with with
81:11 - quincy uh quincy uh larson is the the
81:15 - head of free code camp
81:24 - uh matt says thanks for this jesse great
81:26 - learning experience oh you're welcome
81:27 - i'm i'm glad that uh this was a good
81:30 - experience for you
81:31 - uh edwin says thanks for sharing man i
81:34 - had a hard time trying to solve problems
81:35 - but it's great to feel we're not alone
81:37 - definitely not i have a hard time all
81:39 - the time
81:41 - uh but it's part of the fun of it it's
81:43 - always like a puzzle you know you gotta
81:44 - fix something and then once it works
81:46 - it's awesome
81:54 - okay uh harsh it said a resource for
81:57 - learning back end is from imad course so
82:00 - imad uh so see imad.tech
82:04 - um matt says linda is also a good place
82:07 - to learn about servers or udemy
82:17 - uh harsha says can i make some graphql
82:19 - tutorials for free code cam channels or
82:21 - maybe some mongodb stuff that would be
82:24 - great like i said do do some stuff on
82:26 - your own
82:27 - and then um send it to quincy or
82:31 - i mean i could
82:34 - um anyway i say probably the best thing
82:36 - is make some videos first put it on your
82:38 - own youtube channel
82:40 - and then
82:41 - we'll figure out uh who who at free code
82:44 - camp needs to check that out
82:46 - to prove it to be on free code cam's
82:48 - channel so that's the the first step
82:50 - then is just you know make some content
82:51 - at first
83:02 - oh okay let me show thomas okay harshit
83:05 - has finally figured this out uh it was
83:07 - case sensitive
83:09 - um and we had to replace
83:11 - we we had to use uh uppercase
83:18 - uh let's see let's replace details with
83:22 - details let's try it one more time and
83:24 - then i really have to go i'm afraid i'm
83:26 - going to be late for my meeting
83:29 - my boss is going to be at this meeting
83:31 - so
83:32 - really don't want to be late
83:35 - no is it still not working
83:44 - no
83:45 - still not working
83:46 - um
83:47 - all right i'm definitely gonna have to
83:49 - stop now uh so i'm not late for my
83:51 - meeting so anyway thank you so much
83:53 - everyone for watching uh i really
83:56 - appreciate all the help that you had and
83:57 - all the you know the awesome comments
84:00 - and everyone who helped out you know
84:01 - some people asking questions in the live
84:03 - chat uh you all had some great answers
84:06 - for them uh so really appreciate that uh
84:09 - for everybody that watched you know uh
84:10 - check
84:12 - check me out later on in the week i'll
84:13 - be streaming uh all this week hopefully
84:16 - if i'm not too busy here at work
84:19 - and
84:20 - you can follow me on twitter i usually
84:22 - tweet about what i'm gonna stream about
84:24 - earlier in the day
84:25 - please follow the free code camp youtube
84:27 - channel and
84:28 - set notifications so that you know
84:30 - whenever
84:31 - new videos come out and new streams come
84:33 - on uh so
84:35 - most likely i'll be back tomorrow with
84:37 - another stream until then have a great
84:39 - day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody it's jesse and welcome to live coding with jesse and today we're going to do really basic stuff so we have some html and we need to style it this is within the context of our react app but we're not really going to do any react stuff today so if you're here for react and you're used to the react stuff then you might be disappointed um but this should be a great stream for beginners because normally if you're interested in web development you start out learning html and css so if you're in that that area of just just starting out then stick around for this video and if you're a little bit more advanced in that area it would still be cool to stick around and help answer some questions uh in the live chat uh from some of the newer people and you never know i'll probably mess something up so help is always appreciated uh okay so i think i do have a meeting about this site that i will be creating in the stream in an hour and a half so i'm just gonna try to do two pomodoro sessions and uh some question answer and then finish up uh so we do have kind of a cap we can't go longer than i'd say hour and fifteen minutes uh that should give me enough time to get ready and get to my meeting okay so we have uh a good number of viewers so maybe some new people uh let me just explain briefly how this is gonna go so i'm about to start a pomodoro timer it's a 25 minute session we're going to code for 25 minutes and then i'm going to take a five minute break and check out the live chat answer any questions that you have in the live chat then i'm going to do another 25 minute session of code and then after that i'm going to answer all the questions in the live chat so if you ask a question in the chat and i haven't got to it yet just hang on and i will get to it before the stream is over and then if you can't stick around for the whole stream don't worry about it you can watch it later on uh it will be available here on the free code camp youtube channel uh there's more information in the description like links to the github repo and um i don't know what else i have in there i guess there's a lot of stuff i always just copy and paste it so i don't even know what i have in there but there are some helpful links in there okay so let's start this up and then i'm gonna go over here to my editor i happen to be using visual studio code sometimes i use atom but today i'm using visual studio code and i'm going to shrink this terminal just a bit because we won't be using it too much what i do want to do though is save what i was just working on which is actually a whole nother uh page uh react component so it's not quite working but it's almost there so i'm going to save it now so we can start fresh and make a nice git commit at the end of the stream let me check the status we're going to add this file oops and then i'm going to leave a message so and we'll check out what i've just done here in a in a future stream i've already brought in all the all the data into our wordpress installation uh so we'll need to do some styling for that page at some point um there we go whoa we got a lot of testing going on it's good all the tests are passing i have not made a test yet for this directory.js it wouldn't pass because it's not working but once we get it working then we want to get tests on it as well be very similar to the tests we have for faculty.js okay so let's get to some of our html and css so this is our our react component we're not really going to do anything at all with this react component we're going to be mostly working in dev tools and chrome devtools and then we're just going to kind of copy over our styles so what i would like to do though is make a new folder in our static file so i know if you're if you're familiar with react and you've done things with react this is not at all the normal react way to do things so if you're confused just hold on for a few more minutes and it'll become really obvious why we have to do things this way okay so this is not ideal i wouldn't normally want to do it this way but everything is entirely valid in terms of just regular html uh but because of the time frame where the site has to be made live we're gonna i guess kind of do things a little bit weird at first to save time and then after we launch behind the scenes we're going to clean everything up little by little so that it'll be a smooth transition but it'll buy us a lot more time to make things right i do see a lot of activity in the live chat so if you're just joining a live chat i will take a break after a little while and i'll answer all the questions in the live chat so just hang in there i'm i'm not ignoring you at least not for not forever all right so let's make a new folder and you can also do this from the command line uh but if you're not that familiar with the command line it might be easier to do it like this new folder and we're going to call this styles and then within the styles folder we're going to make a new file and we're going to call this faculty dot css because that's the page that we're going to be on so it may make more sense at some point to extract some of the things we put in faculty out you know up to um a different uh set of css a different file and then share it among components but for now this this should be good uh we're i normally would like to use sas instead of just plain css but we don't have that set up yet for this project so maybe we'll set it up later but um today it should be it should actually be better this way because it'll be you know more basic for those of you who haven't really gotten into sas all right so let me bring over the site so you all can see what we're starting with uh and what we're starting with is just the very you know basic basic of of sites html with almost no styling so this is what we're starting with we have this data which doesn't look like much i know but what what we have here behind the scenes is a lot of structure to this data in terms of the tags so we just need to style those uh it'll probably be a good idea to make these images actually work the paths all broke when we transfer things from one database to another so let me make these images work first i'd hope to have time to do this beforehand but i got caught up uh with some other data so just for this i'm going to change i'm going to manually change the the files there and i'm gonna add so on my other screen i'm just changing the urls for these images manually so that they will point to the right place so i believe we only have two images let's see okay let's update that and see if we have images now there we go we have images okay so one of these images is supposed to be for a a detail view and one is supposed to be for what they call a list view on the other side so we'll just hide one of them for now eventually we won't have to deal with two at all but for right now i don't want to edit the data too much because we have a lot of data here and and any manual editing we do is is going to end up taking a long time if we want to duplicate that for everything so for now let's just take the smaller of the two images which i believe is this image let's see image there we go and for the list view image we want to just hide that completely so that'll be the first thing that we put here in our css so let me make sure this view image yep all lower case list you image and i'm going to say display none okay you know what i forgot to uh to actually hook this in here uh so let's do that as as well let's see so my let me see for my react people here what's the easiest way right now for me to connect this to the component uh from my static files i'll check the the chat in just a minute after delay's over and see what what you are saying but for now we could do none okay so if you've never used chrome dev tools before it's really good you can inspect anything on a page and manipulate it right here in your browser none of the changes are permanent if you refresh the page they all go away but it allows you to make a lot of changes here uh really easily just to see what they're like um so that's kind of you know what we're what we're gonna do for it for this okay so i could see uh using next head is probably the best way to go according to harshit so thank you all right so let's go import and this is some react stuff so if you're not really familiar with react don't worry about this we're going to go back to the normal css here in a second let's see and we're just doing this so that our css will be applied to these this component which controls that page okay so just have to do a little bit you know differently than you know we normally would uh so let's let's see if i can put all right so within the head then can i just put regular link tags i think i think i can i think we could do just regular link tag all right so we will do that link is it source for a link tag or href i can never remember i think it's an href i guess we'll find out in a second um okay so we have to do rel and ahref h thanks thanks everyone in the live chat for helping out with that okay so our href is going to be what we got static where we'll be at right let's just try it as static css oops all right let's see okay not working let's just inspect this and see i imagine it has something to do with the path um mmhmm uh rayon is saying add in type text css okay we'll add that in all right let's check that out then hmm all right let's see let's check our sources see if it'll tell us oops i mean our console um okay so that's definitely not the right path static can i see the structure all right here's our folder structure um style oh you know what it's the wrong thing i didn't call it css i call it styles sorry about that everyone my fault there we go now it works okay great um all right so now whatever styles we end up putting in our faculty.css uh will automatically be reflected here okay wonderful all right so here's i wha how we want this page to look let's kind of move this about here uh so this title we'll want this to be much larger so i guess let's start at the top and and work our way down from there so name is the name of this tag let's see what we want we definitely want let's see all right let's take this root details all right so i definitely know i want a different font as well so let's just do this on main we're going to do font family and roboto and sans serif as a backup and there we go all right so we got the font we want now let's work on our title all right sorry our name all right so let's do font size um what do we want let's try 24 pixels see how that looks okay i like that 24 looks good this is going to be pretty experimental as well um as we're going through since we have to work with an html structure that we didn't create ourselves we're just going to have to try some things out which i think is kind of fun it's not the fastest way to do things but it is interesting all right so let's let's throw this in uh under our name and one good thing about this is all these custom html tags are named you know very nicely it makes sense the way they're named we probably should have this in some sort of container so let's see let's see what container class we're using here i assume we're using something here all right let's check it out um where are we at index all right yeah let's put in a grid container in here actually i went for the entire thing yeah we'll start out with a grid container we will need to pull this in i assume grid so sorry i said i wasn't going to do too much with react but i guess we will be doing a bit with react uh so all this is gonna do what it should do is give us some nicer margins and i believe it made them worse okay i think maybe we'll need to wrap this in some grid items as well yeah let's try putting this in a good item you know what i think we did have some inline styles though did we all right let's let's go back to our css for now and well let's do this first are we getting this expected a different indentation all right there we go um let's go red item i thought it was great item okay it's like this and there we go so for for those of you who are interested in your kind of why we're doing this in react we're using materialize or i'm sorry material ui the beta version of material ui for these components and let's see i've messed something up let's see see how bad it messed it up okay not terribly but why am i doing this now oh no i guess those are just the regular colors i'm not used to this color scheme it was supposed to be the same color scheme i used for adam but i think there are some differences um there we go how harsh it's saying in the live chat to use format on save i will i will use that i don't since i don't have a lot of time on this stream i'll i'm not going to switch it right now but i will use that later on okay so that little distraction i had with using grid actually didn't do anything um but let's see i guess i guess it's okay for now okay all right so let's look at what else we have here i do want to put i want to find the container i guess this would be it this this container here for the test or even maine i suppose we could do it on main all right so let's go to our our main here and try to put in a let me think i need margin need some sort of padding or margin maybe i don't want to do it on main let's just do it on this content div margin and we just want 16 pixels all right that's fine for now i just wanted to get it off of the very edge of the page where i'm going to have to think up some other way but i'd like to maybe do it within this grid system i also have to check out the documentation i suppose but i don't want to get into it right now because i've said that this is going to be you know mostly regular html css and that would be getting into more of the material ui react components so i don't want to get into that right now so let's just do this on our css so we're going to make actually let's get rid of that we'll have more room and i can make this a bit bigger okay so i'm not going to do it on the main let's do it right there and then let me just do and i want to do its data test id content okay how do we do this oh you know what it's not like that it's like this all right so we're gonna put in brackets and we're gonna say um what was that called again data test id all right so this should select that i think let's see if it does interesting um i think it's just doing that because i haven't put anything in here uh and we're gonna add that margin 16 pixels there we go so let me make sure that this worked before i try to explain what's going on i don't want to explain something that's wrong let's do a refresh here yep that looks good so what i've done here is i've selected div you know the divs but i want a specific div so i only want the divs where it has an attribute of data test id and that attribute equals content so if you ever have an html element that has some type of custom attribute you can grab that attribute use it to select that div and and grab pretty much anything you know any custom attribute so that's kind of useful uh the syntax is maybe a little bit different than you normally use but you know it could be like i said it could be with anything the only thing you do you use these square brackets uh the first item you just type it out as normal equals and then the second part after the equal sign is you're going to want to put that in single or double quotes all right so now we can move on and i think i don't mind it being i don't mind it being like this on a small screen but on a large screen i'd very much like to take up more space and kind of have things side by side uh so i'm okay with the name and the picture being here um but then maybe let's let's move this other data up and uh make it kind of a whole another another column you know if we can all right so first let's inspect this and let's figure out if we have something that kind of goes around the whole thing i don't know that we do hmm well that root component goes around quite a lot of it let's do that then let's put the root component we'll keep it that's that's actually really weird that's that's very odd how it how it was assembled in there um education because the title for this section is within that root component but then the data for that the rest of the content for that section is down here outside of it all right this is some interesting markup here it's it's going to be a little bit more difficult to do what i want i'm not sure what this f is just hanging out here what is this f well i guess we'll we'll figure out where it's from at some point and get rid of it there we go details type f all right let's get rid of that as well so we're going to want details type to display none um let's just add it on here so if you're doing you know css and you want to apply the same styles to more than one element you can do that just with a comma and a space in between so we should if we refresh we shouldn't see that f anymore great so we don't see that f okay again if you didn't uh if you weren't here from the beginning um we didn't create this html we're kind of stuck with it at first um so that's why we're we're kind of doing some weird things here but realistically on the job you may get stuck with some markup that you have no control over and you just have to do the best you can with what you've been given that's happened to me quite a lot uh as a frontend developer so i know it would be better if we could do it differently and change the markup but you can't always do that okay so now let's take hmm cv link interesting not exactly the best title we may have to come up with some creative way to change this i'm going to think about that um right here this is a link to you know curriculum vitae uh pdf i hope it's a pdf it is uh but you wouldn't really know that right off the bat so we're gonna need to add something in here and maybe change the title okay so this phone number i want it up closer to the picture so hopefully it's in yes no right we can't can't do that i think we're just gonna have to bring everything over huh hmm all right new plan let's try to get it to where all these details are automatically open and see how much we're dealing with before i decide on what columns we're using um so you can see in this case we do have quite a lot of information so let's let's work with that first the markup it's just making it a little difficult to really do the columns the way i want so we we still may be able to do it but i'd rather do do something first that i know needs done all right so wow these details what changes so as long as they have open on them it's okay i guess so we're gonna need some hmm i need to change this okay uh harsh it sorry i just um i just saw that i you are talking about using ngrok yeah let's get ngrok up and running let me find my terminal where's my terminal i thought i had ngrok open already i guess i didn't okay um shoot i can't remember how's there we go nope it's not http 3000 okay all right i'm going to paste the link here into the live chat if you follow that link you'll be able to see what i'm seeing so you'll you'll want to go i'm going to paste in the where i'm at um so after ngrok after the the ngrok.io part you're going to want to add what i've just pasted in as well so slash faculty slash haney hyphen eric so you just copy and paste it right there all right so i think the best thing to do now would be to add some logic in our component sorry for the yawn okay and my timer is up and i have no idea how long it's been up i um i was focused and i didn't even hear it okay i will take a short break now and go to the live chat see what questions are there and then we'll continue on after that and we may need to cut the second session short second code session short since we went long on the first one i'm gonna scroll all the way up to the top of the live chat and uh just get it to as many questions as i can uh manoj says should i and sorry if i mispronounced that please let me know how to pronounce it properly so should i learn js or ts i'm assuming javascript or typescript um if you're gonna go for something first uh i would learn javascript first but i i have no experience at all with with typescript so you may want to talk to somebody who uses typescript to get another opinion on that let's see uh no beer said in response to that uh you can learn typescript because typescript has some advanced program that can convert into javascript so that that's cool the the only thing i would say to that i guess is um since javascript is way more widely used in typescript knowing javascript will help you to be able to read other people's code and contribute to their code base more easily so it does kind of depend on what kind of work you see yourself doing if it's all new stuff or you kind of have control over what goes into it then you know use whatever you want but if you'd like to get involved in existing projects javascript might be better for you uh unidos says i'm a i'm from developer from brazil and other countries do they accept foreign as well i don't i mean it just depends on the country uh and on the place so like i'm from the united states uh even within the united states it would depend on where you are within the country as to whether or not foreigners are accepted well uh there are some areas of the country where they're very you know accepted in other areas of the country where you know not so much uh and i imagine other countries are the same it just it just kind of depends on on where you're at so it's kind of a difficult question to answer like you know in general across the board but uh even in you know in my uh university where i work we do have some employees who have come from other countries just you know to work here and as far as i know they you know everything's going pretty well for him i'm not i don't know about you know the outside of of the workplace how things go for them but um at least within the workplace you know the university that i work for is pretty open to that um menno says very confused between angular react and view um i i guess there are definite differences i i don't really think i can i can really do a great job of explaining all the differences to you but i think the best way to really get a good idea is to do like the basic hello world example for react angular and view it shouldn't take you too long and then you'll get at least a little idea of what each one is like you certainly won't be anywhere near experienced in in any of them uh but maybe you just kind of see what it's like and then maybe watch some videos of people doing something a little bit more advanced with each one uh that way you don't have to spend a ton of time learning you know before you make your decision but you might be able to make a more informed decision on which one you'd like to learn more last question uh no beer asks why don't you use sass i think that's very logical for styling dom and it looks like rhaegal already says he said the answer but basically it's i just didn't have sas set up yet so for sash you need to be able to you know compile that into regular css so once i get that set up i would much rather use sas i prefer that but at least for now we're just doing regular css okay so i'm gonna make a note of where i've left off at and we're gonna do some more coding so here's what i'm going to do since i have a lot in the live chat i'm going to plan on taking a good bit of time to to answer the questions so this next session i'm just going to do a 10 minute session for coding and then see where we are uh harshit says it looked like engroc has crashed crashed i'm not sure i'm seeing let me let me uh check this as well because i'm seeing a lot of activity you know looking like it didn't crash but let's see okay it's still working for me yeah okay it's still working for me so i don't maybe um try to refresh the browser or go back to it i did go to a faculty page and it worked make sure everything's spelled correctly so let me i'm gonna paste the complete link in right now so this link right now is working for me no it's not when i click from within there it doesn't work interesting what's the difference that's odd that's really odd all right i just typed in the faculty member's name and and see if you can just copy and paste that in because for some reason it doesn't work with the link but it does work when i type it in manually so i don't know all right orson says maybe it's because we're using the development build right now yeah it's entirely possible uh that that's that's why it's not working okay so let's get a bit more done here and okay so we want to get these details few i've actually never used the details uh html element this is the first time i've ever seen it so i'm not sure it looks like there is some default activity here in that it automatically shows details and it automatically has this open close action going on so we really don't want that i don't think there's that much data that we really need the open and close stuff going on so actually this one might be long yeah that might be a bit longer but and that's that's going to need some work on the formatting but for now at least let's let's change these details uh and everywhere we have a details tag we need to change that i guess just to a div let's give it a div with the class um i i thought we maybe could give it a class details but now that i think about it we really don't even need that okay rook rook says so it's a basic html element thanks yeah that's uh the more i look at it the more i i think it's got to be a basic html element right so i like i said i've never seen it before but it that's how it behaves so unfortunately i don't think we're going to be able to use css for this one we're going to have to use a little bit of javascript so let's see let's go back to our component here our faculty.js component and let's see what we can do so this is all going to come to us as a string right yeah it's all going to be a string let's see if we can if we can do something so let's say um format content all right so let me do a bit of javascript here so what we've done here we're just going to make a function here and we're using an arrow function okay and that's because we want to have proper access to the word this uh in here so let's go within here we're gonna want to grab this data now within here we already have we've already grabbed this props but we don't do it outside of here so we need to start with this props um start um okay and isaiah is asking can anyone see my my chat uh isaiah i do i see your chat okay do it in render okay harsh is saying you can use a regular expression to do it in render um that's true i was kind of thinking that we may have some other things that we want to change so i would just make this uh function be where we make all those changes but i'm certainly open to other ideas uh also i was gonna do like a you know like a fine because i'm not great with regular expressions but at some point we could certainly change it if it would make the code more concise uh let's see stator factory edge is not content we're going to want to let's see okay um rook work pasted some helpful information from mdn which is the mozilla developer network uh i'm going to read this out just since you know we were talking about what kind of tag that details tag was it says details is used to create a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an open state a summary or label can be provided using the summary element interesting interesting okay uh let's see i got i'm gonna have to look up uh the syntax on replace i can't even remember the last time i used it all right so let's go all right so dot replace it looks like the first thing the first string is what we are looking for in the second one is what we want to replace what if we want to do multiple things at once can we do that all right um well i don't want double quotes i'm not thinking all right let's go with um actually can do this let's say what did we want details yeah we want to replace details um globally so we want to get all of the details replaced and we want to replace that with div and let's just say class equals double quotes here class equals details that way um i'll be able to tell which which ones we've actually changed like that easily let's see if that'll work don't do this alright what about closing tag yeah hardship that's what yeah the closing tag will be missed so that's why i was asking if we could do two things at once otherwise i'm just gonna have to do content replace twice in a row so it looks like in the documentation i'm not seeing let's see blue house car oh here we go we can do i know we can't i'm not seeing a way that i could i can get multiple things and replace them all with the same thing but i'm not seeing in documentation where i can um get multiple things and then replace them with multiple things so i mean potentially potentially we could do this oh no this is not gonna be good we need to escape that how do we escape okay harsh it's um has some code that that may work here so let's check that out um if you're haven't haven't watched uh before um harshit here is a member of the community he watches the streams and contributes quite a bit of really good code so when i say harsh it that's what uh that's who i'm talking about uh so i'm gonna check what he has going on here okay our i see what you've done the only problem i have with that though is what if the word details is also contained in there and i don't want to change the word details that's why i've added in you know this and as well as this one the thing is though i'm going to need to escape that so let me i'll bring this over quickly just to see so so hardships will definitely work a harshit solution here so we're replacing all instances of details with div but what i'm saying is what if you know what if in here in in these paragraphs what if the word details was inside of here that would then get replaced with div and we certainly don't want that okay we're probably going to wrap this up soon i just got a notification that my meeting is in 30 minutes i do have to walk somewhere else on campus so i need to allow for time for that okay um so let me let's go back uh to whoops my timer did go off all right you know what i'm i'm gonna go to live chat because i promised earlier that i'll get through all the questions in the live chat so harsha said uh that he's gonna work on this um what we were just working on here to be able to make sure that it replaces only the detail tags and nothing else so okay harsh it says it's fixed so let me check that out now okay wonderful wonderful all right so let's let's use this now i'm going to copy and paste here what what hardship has done um hardship i'm just doing it like that because that's definitely going to be a lot faster than um uh the pull requests been merging the pull requests as expected what did i do wrong did i put this in the wrong spot no i didn't i did not put in the wrong spot maybe i just don't properly okay so it looks like a double quote there we go so we needed one more double quotes okay wonderful eagle i forgot an equals thanks harshit like why oh well sometimes that happens stuff you do all the time and it's just like you forget so why are what's it saying now i expected a comma somewhere oh and it's expecting that a space is required after comma there we go all right great uh data is not defined content is assigned a value but never used uh okay okay i see how harsh it also did this a bit differently so um let's see so i should put this here so let's do that this is the last thing we'll do and then we'll finish up okay so if you're not familiar with const uh it's the same it fulfills the same function in this case as if we were to use their var um so i'm not going to get into the details of what's different about const but uh that's basically what we're doing we're just declaring a variable and now we're taking that data we had before but now we're replacing some of the bits of data and putting in some some different things so now we don't need this anymore uh so that's nice that that got rid of um a lot of extra lines that we didn't need way to say constant sound value yeah and we need data oh okay are we inside we're not inside the render anymore are we no we're not so crazy not here you're not there not there it won't work so harsh is saying it won't work so things have changed oh yeah return change i need to see this file the whole file it's not showing me the whole file right now what i'm looking at faculty render return layout oh okay i see so harsh it has changed more um than what we originally had absolutely oh i see i see what i messed up that was the first that's what messed me up i just saw a layout and uh and that okay the details too okay of course all right wonderful and then within this we just need to put content all right let's check that out no oops did i forget an equals i did all right great all right so hmm um you know what i don't think it works this has to be a casting caching issue hmm uh let me try a different faculty member oh okay harsh is saying it's detail okay it's detail and not details okay there we go come on oops well if it is caching i know it'll fix it let's just restart the server okay that'll be the last thing i try and then i i've got to get to the questions or i'll never get through them all hmm it's very odd oh wait a sec it is details within us so actually we were right before it was details with an s so let me save that and refresh and uh let's go with a different faculty member uh let's try we'll try someone different they're they're not gonna have a um let's see they're not gonna have a an image because i didn't change it for anyone else let's try one that's easy okay walker john that's easy to spell no it's still the same details okay i've got to stop with with this i got to get to the live chat so i'm going to have to go fast as it is all right so let me scroll up to where i left off so uh if you are new this happens i don't know if i'd say frequently but it happens regularly that uh we in fact don't get done what we wanted to get done which is fine because this is supposed to be a portrayal of an accurate portrayal of my work as a frontend developer and things don't always work out the way that i expect them to so this will work out at some point we'll just have it'll just take longer than i thought so unfortunately we won't be able to solve it on today's stream but i'll certainly if we figure it out before tomorrow's stream i'll i'll certainly explain it to everyone tomorrow all right so i'm gonna do my best to get through this all these questions uh if i happen to not get to your question or i miss it just ask me the same question in the comments below uh this video or you can send me the question on twitter and i'll be happy to answer later on okay uh reijan asks which software i'm using i'm using visual studio code let's see jewel says hello hey how's it going thanks for watching uh let's see um no brs is is it free open source a visual studio code is is free uh someone says uh i should go now why is it so boring um coding is actually really cool so i apologize if the stream is boring it's probably entirely my fault so uh don't don't blame the code blame me if you'd like to give me some uh some helpful tips you know some helpful advice on how i can make this more exciting uh please let me know i'm always trying to improve uh andrew davis says is grid hard to learn i'm having trouble understanding how it works um no beer says nope uh it's easy but you have to practice it more and more cool and i i don't think i can improve on that that answer that's you know that's perfect um as long as you practice it it'll become like second nature and you'll be able to use it you'll be able to use it easily g streak says the reason i don't watch live streams i'm assuming i messed something up at that point i don't remember what was going on then but uh yeah things do get messed up if that in fact was the case if that's the reason then yeah it happens you can't there's no editing on live streams things break things don't work and you know you just gotta work through it but that's in a sense the point of this live stream is the value in it is seeing things break and seeing how we work through it okay no beer said uh when we use the css we did not actually need the quotes around content so i was mistaken i i i guess i've always thought that was necessary uh i was mistaken on that so i guess you don't need you don't need that so thanks for that no beer i appreciate you pointing that out ah john hanson said yes he's going to bring in the important i can feel it i didn't have to bring it important well not yet at least i'm sure it will happen later on uh a studio s how many days a week do you live stream i try to do five but sometimes things happen like i meetings or other things so i don't always get five days a week but i do try monday through friday yesterday i didn't get a chance to stream uh that was because we had someone else streaming so uh go ahead and check that out i think it was uh ethan uh was live streaming so uh sorry about not streaming but it was kind of in that same time period where i normally stream and um so you know i just kind of watched his stream and uh commented on there and so we're going to do a better job of trying to coordinate stream time so hopefully we won't both try to stream at the same time uh products geek says what do you use to make the drop down i'm assuming you're talking about these drop downs here in the details and this is just an html element if you use the details element it automatically creates this for you which i just learned today so it seems pretty useful if you're trying to keep the site you know kind of really light uh let's see isaiah says hi hey my name is jose i'm 14 years old uh if you want to check out my code pen it's isaiah ct i'm wondering what projects i can make i finished the port i know html css js and basic ruby and python this is my portfolio um let's see this is darno okay so uh must not have let isaiah it usually doesn't let you put in um urls if you put some spaces in the url usually it works if you want me to see your portfolio feel free to direct message me on twitter or you could just you know tag me in twitter uh with the link to your portfolio i'd be happy to check it out uh the question is what's the best way for me to be able to get my stuff seen um it's i guess it's tough to get your own project scene out there unless you kind of directly send it to different companies as you know check out my portfolio i'm looking for internships or jobs or whatever uh otherwise um you could consider contributing to open source projects and then that way um you know your your github profile will grow right and your name will be out there for in these other projects that people already look at a lot so that's a good way to do it as well um isaiah says where's the best place to learn to make servers um you know what i i don't know that i'm the best to answer that um because i mainly do front end uh so some of the back end people what resources do you recommend for isaiah uh to be able to learn more about about servers if you know any resources let me know i wish i could answer that question better but i guess i'm running out of time so maybe if i had a little bit more time to think about it i could come up with something but like i said uh usually if i have to do anything with a server i look up the documentation on digitalocean they have good documentation and i just follow the instructions isaiah says do you have any insight of the new courses coming to free code camp my 14 year old brain needs more um i haven't seen that much of the new stuff but from what i've seen it looks really good so i'm excited about it i think i'm going to try some of the new stuff out when it does come out as far as i know it's supposed to come out around christmas time so sometime at the end of this month hopefully it's on schedule um but as far as specifics i don't really know a lot of specifics uh i know there's going to be some ex6 stuff in there i'm sorry es6 in there um there'll be some more react stuff uh some stuff with sas so that's all i know for sure you can of course check out all the new stuff already if you want to um you know check out the free code camp github uh repositories and you could see it all we can even contribute if you'd like all right constantine asked is that a valid way to declare a function no it wasn't a valid way i just for some reason completely forgot the right way to do an arrow function even though we use them here all the time on the stream so oh you know what i took it out so sorry but anyway that yeah that in fact was the wrong way to do it uh let's see duncan says uh may i request live coding in java uh i would not be the one to be able to do live coding in java because my java skills are limited to like a one day course that i took at some point where we like kind of made a game and that was years ago so i don't remember any of it um so if someone else has some java skills and would like to live stream you know maybe get in contact with quincy uh maybe on twitter or something or send him an email with maybe some examples of your live coding uh which you've done before and maybe he might be interested i don't really make those decisions it's more up to quincy so i i can't say one way or another whether um whether you'd be able to do it i just you know encourage you to you know do some live coding on your own and then you know share it with with quincy uh quincy uh larson is the the head of free code camp uh matt says thanks for this jesse great learning experience oh you're welcome i'm i'm glad that uh this was a good experience for you uh edwin says thanks for sharing man i had a hard time trying to solve problems but it's great to feel we're not alone definitely not i have a hard time all the time uh but it's part of the fun of it it's always like a puzzle you know you gotta fix something and then once it works it's awesome okay uh harsh it said a resource for learning back end is from imad course so imad uh so see imad.tech um matt says linda is also a good place to learn about servers or udemy uh harsha says can i make some graphql tutorials for free code cam channels or maybe some mongodb stuff that would be great like i said do do some stuff on your own and then um send it to quincy or i mean i could um anyway i say probably the best thing is make some videos first put it on your own youtube channel and then we'll figure out uh who who at free code camp needs to check that out to prove it to be on free code cam's channel so that's the the first step then is just you know make some content at first oh okay let me show thomas okay harshit has finally figured this out uh it was case sensitive um and we had to replace we we had to use uh uppercase uh let's see let's replace details with details let's try it one more time and then i really have to go i'm afraid i'm going to be late for my meeting my boss is going to be at this meeting so really don't want to be late no is it still not working no still not working um all right i'm definitely gonna have to stop now uh so i'm not late for my meeting so anyway thank you so much everyone for watching uh i really appreciate all the help that you had and all the you know the awesome comments and everyone who helped out you know some people asking questions in the live chat uh you all had some great answers for them uh so really appreciate that uh for everybody that watched you know uh check check me out later on in the week i'll be streaming uh all this week hopefully if i'm not too busy here at work and you can follow me on twitter i usually tweet about what i'm gonna stream about earlier in the day please follow the free code camp youtube channel and set notifications so that you know whenever new videos come out and new streams come on uh so most likely i'll be back tomorrow with another stream until then have a great day
