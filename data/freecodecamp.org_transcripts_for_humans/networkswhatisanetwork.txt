00:00 - Hi, I'm Rouli from Free Code Camp. Today we are going to talk about: what is a
00:04 - network? So, before we answer that
question let's take the example of two
00:07 - people who are trying to communicate
with each other. So what happens here?
00:10 - When one person talks he's creating
vibrations in the air which is the
00:14 - medium and these vibrations reach the
other party and that's how two people
00:20 - communicate. So one person talks and the vibrations travel through the medium and
00:25 - reach the other person who is listening.
Now, in case of two computers how do they
00:29 - talk? They don't have mouths yet or they can't create vibrations in there in the air, so
00:34 - how do they talk? So, here what we have to do is we need to create some sort of
00:39 - connection between these two computers. So, a connection between two or more
00:44 - computers, or more devices, to communicate between them is called a network.
