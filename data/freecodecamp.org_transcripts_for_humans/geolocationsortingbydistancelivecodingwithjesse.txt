00:06 - hey everybody it's
00:07 - Jesse and we're going to do some
00:11 - geolocation stuff today so the BR
00:14 - there's a geolocation API for the
00:16 - browser where I'm sure you've seen this
00:20 - before a website will ask you know can
00:23 - we get your location or something like
00:26 - that and if you allow them to get your
00:29 - location then usually they use that to
00:31 - tell you either you know what's the
00:34 - weather near you or what events are near
00:37 - you or maybe give you get you directions
00:40 - to somewhere so in this case we want to
00:43 - get the location of the user and then
00:45 - compare it to the location of our events
00:48 - and then order our
00:50 - events from those that are closest to
00:53 - those that are farest
00:55 - away uh before I get started I just want
00:58 - to let you know that about 12 minutes
01:01 - ago the power went out here so if
01:06 - everything just gets cut off it's the
01:08 - power probably went out again so it's
01:10 - there are big thunderstorms happening
01:12 - right now so uh hopefully it won't
01:15 - happen again uh but if it does I'll try
01:18 - to get restarted and get back on as soon
01:20 - as I can I've never had a stream cut out
01:23 - in the middle so I'm not even sure if I
01:25 - can join the same stream again or not
01:27 - I'm thinking yes
01:30 - um cuz I I wouldn't have actually
01:32 - clicked the button to stop the
01:34 - stream it'll just say like I've lost
01:37 - connection so as long as I get the
01:38 - computer up and running and start OBS
01:41 - again to start streaming should be good
01:44 - to go uh
01:46 - so also I want
01:50 - to acknowledge the contributions that
01:53 - you all have made so a lot of people
01:56 - contribute in the live chat and are very
01:59 - helpful uh but then also I've
02:02 - had some people contribute directly uh
02:07 - to the repository for the site we've
02:09 - been working on so uh so V and uh Danny
02:13 - and uh Fabian
02:16 - or I thought about it the other day uh
02:19 - since you're from France it's probably
02:21 - not pronounced Fabian so Fabian I'm not
02:24 - sure let me know if you're
02:26 - watching um so anyway thanks so much for
02:30 - these uh contributions
02:34 - and feel free to contribute I started
02:36 - putting some issues
02:38 - in uh in the
02:41 - repo so I'm going to make try to
02:44 - remember to put the issues in here and
02:48 - maybe if if you've never contributed to
02:49 - a repository before some of these are
02:52 - going to be pretty easy some more in
02:54 - depth but you know maybe it'll get you
02:56 - some practice in how to contribute and
03:00 - uh you know certainly nobody feel
03:02 - obligated to contribute this is
03:04 - definitely the project is completely my
03:07 - responsibility but uh I know it's some
03:10 - sometimes it's intimidating to try to
03:11 - submit pool requests to projects so this
03:13 - might be a nice like small project uh to
03:17 - get just to get a feel for for how you
03:19 - do it and uh if you need any help let me
03:22 - know and I could try to walk you through
03:24 - it uh and if you submit a pool request
03:26 - and it's not exactly what I need no big
03:28 - deal I'll just let you know what needs
03:31 - changed and you make the changes and
03:33 - submit it again uh I'm I'm Lu going to
03:36 - be
03:37 - upset if you submit a bunch of pool
03:39 - requests uh I'm I'm happy for the
03:41 - assistance
03:44 - so anyway let's let's get
03:48 - started let me move this out of here
03:51 - because we won't need it right
03:54 - now
03:56 - so here's the steps I was just kind of
03:59 - thinking in the last few minutes before
04:00 - I start this video what we need to do we
04:03 - need to
04:05 - add let me know if this is too small I
04:08 - think this is the same font size we had
04:11 - yesterday I don't think I mess with it
04:12 - so if it was okay yesterday it should
04:14 - still be good um we need to add a map
04:19 - field to the nearby event custom post
04:23 - type so that's going to show up in
04:25 - WordPress so let me let me show you this
04:27 - here I actually already added it
04:30 - but I didn't add in an API key and I
04:33 - need to so that's why this isn't working
04:35 - right now so that step is partially
04:40 - finished once that's in place we'll
04:44 - we'll fill out some data in there so we
04:46 - have something coming in through the API
04:48 - and then we need to prompt the user for
04:50 - their location that's the part where
04:52 - we'll use the geolocation API which I
04:54 - had open somewhere but after I had to
04:57 - restart my computer uh from the
05:00 - the power
05:01 - outage all my windows are in different
05:03 - places so I'll try to find it it might
05:06 - actually be faster to just search for it
05:08 - again because I have so many windows
05:10 - open um after that we need to compare
05:14 - the user's location to the event
05:16 - location so this should be we're we'll
05:20 - have the latitude and longitude for both
05:23 - of
05:24 - these then we're going to show the
05:27 - events um we're going to put the closest
05:30 - events that are closest to the user
05:32 - first and then go from there to those
05:36 - are farthest away the last one I think
05:39 - is just wishful thinking and that's end
05:40 - the stream one time which rarely ever
05:43 - happens but I'm going to try uh so I was
05:46 - in a little bit earlier than normal this
05:48 - morning so I I really don't want to be
05:50 - here super
05:53 - late and I also work through my lunch
05:55 - break so I can definitely get out of
05:58 - here I could probably leave now and be
06:01 - fine but I want to do the
06:04 - stream so I'm gonna check the uh the
06:07 - live chat and just say hello to
06:09 - everybody before we get
06:12 - started hey
06:16 - everyone AAR says hello from
06:20 - Mars
06:23 - Hi Sam says I enjoy that these are
06:26 - becoming a more daily thing yeah it's
06:28 - it's intended to be a daily thing at
06:30 - least Monday through Friday uh but I had
06:34 - some there were sometimes when I
06:36 - was I couldn't stream because either I
06:39 - was sick or uh occasionally the stream
06:43 - time
06:43 - changes because I have
06:46 - meetings uh but basically yeah it's it
06:49 - should be pretty much every day if I
06:55 - can hey No No's back uh how's it going
07:00 - says uh second time on the
07:05 - streams uh and old ask does Jesse like
07:08 - to HTML CSS JS beginner kind of stuff um
07:13 - yes I do like to do that so if you're
07:16 - more like at the beginner level and
07:18 - you're looking at this like this is over
07:21 - my head we're at the end of a project so
07:24 - at the beginning of this project uh if
07:26 - you go back and watch some of the first
07:28 - recordings it'll be way more beginner
07:31 - level now we're to the end so you know
07:34 - we've already taken a lot of those
07:35 - little steps and now we have something a
07:38 - lot more complex so it's hard to jump in
07:40 - at this point although I'm still going
07:42 - to try to explain things as best I can
07:44 - so hopefully no matter what level you're
07:46 - at you'll still get something out of
07:49 - it um as soon as I'm done with this
07:51 - project I'll jump into another project
07:53 - and that'll be like starting all over
07:55 - again so I always try to do something
07:58 - new or something better or try a new
08:00 - tool or something so each project will
08:02 - be a little bit different but it's end
08:04 - up it's going to be like a cycle
08:07 - of you know going back to the basics of
08:10 - setting up a site and then building on
08:13 - that so if it's if it's a little bit
08:16 - over your head right now don't worry you
08:18 - know give it a week or so I'll be done
08:20 - with this site and then you know we'll
08:22 - be right back to some basic stuff I am
08:24 - also going to put some videos on my
08:26 - personal channel that are going to be
08:28 - more like really basic level tutorial
08:31 - videos and uh I have I have some
08:34 - outlines and some notes ready for those
08:36 - it's just a matter of finding a little
08:37 - bit of time where it's quiet enough uh
08:40 - at my house or some time at at work to
08:44 - just do those
08:47 - videos
08:50 - okay all right great Rohan says font
08:53 - size is good uh and also ask Google Maps
08:56 - API yeah so I'm going to be using the
08:59 - Google Maps API at the very least within
09:02 - WordPress here to pull up a Google map
09:06 - and basically what I want so you can see
09:10 - this right
09:12 - now the uh content editor comes in
09:17 - here fills out the title of the event
09:20 - the date and then the display date which
09:23 - uh if you if you're not sure why I have
09:25 - two different dates here uh check out
09:27 - yesterday's episode and I I explained
09:29 - why I needed uh the date in two
09:31 - different formats here um you know and
09:34 - they fill out this basic
09:35 - info but now in addition to the location
09:39 - and this is how it will actually display
09:41 - I also want them to put the location in
09:43 - here if they search and type in the
09:45 - location here then it it should on the
09:49 - API end it'll come out with with some
09:54 - data uh probably multiple Fields but one
09:57 - of those fields will contain the
09:58 - latitude and longitude and that's what I
10:01 - need so that's that's where I'm going to
10:03 - use the Google Maps API here and then
10:07 - we'll see for this
10:09 - step compare the user location to event
10:14 - location I may need
10:18 - to use some sort of API so I don't I
10:22 - don't really know what the best API is I
10:26 - I did a little bit of research
10:27 - beforehand so if you all have experience
10:29 - with this let me know what you think I'm
10:31 - also thinking a really kind of fast way
10:34 - to do this potentially could be to just
10:37 - do some comparisons with just the raw
10:40 - latitude and
10:42 - longitude uh potentially it might be
10:46 - possible to just do some basic
10:49 - math comparing the latitude longitude of
10:53 - the event to the user location and then
10:55 - be able to give a rough kind of estimate
10:57 - of distance
10:59 - uh from the user so this you know these
11:01 - aren't going to be pinpoint locations
11:03 - they're just going to be the general
11:05 - location of a city so it doesn't need to
11:06 - be like super
11:08 - exact so if you have any ideas for that
11:11 - as well let me know we you know we we'll
11:14 - get into that more when we get to this
11:16 - step though and then see what the best
11:18 - way uh to do this would be if you're
11:20 - just joining for the first
11:22 - time I will say these aren't tutorials
11:27 - this is me just doing my daily work so
11:29 - that's why I'm saying things like I
11:30 - don't really know what we're going to do
11:31 - let's try it uh
11:34 - because that's that's my work I know I
11:37 - want to do this this part of the website
11:39 - is arguably going to be the most useful
11:42 - part of the site to our users and I
11:45 - think this feature in particular will be
11:49 - the most useful feature of this part of
11:53 - the site this nearby events part so um
11:57 - so I know I want it I know how I want it
11:59 - to work and I just need to figure out
12:01 - how to make it work with with all of you
12:09 - helping all
12:11 - right let's see just had a bunch of
12:14 - stuff in the live chat so I just want to
12:15 - check it out very
12:17 - quickly and this will give you uh a few
12:20 - minutes too to um think about these
12:23 - these steps and these
12:25 - questions um philli says I'm a
12:28 - self-taught coach and I just recently
12:30 - stumbled on your site best self-learning
12:32 - resource ever wow that's I'm glad you
12:35 - think that awesome uh and thanks thanks
12:38 - for saying that uh I love uh comments
12:41 - like that it uh keeps me going and keeps
12:44 - me thinking that this is a worthwhile
12:46 - thing to do so I really appreciate
12:48 - that um WIS M23 says hi I am new here
12:52 - hey welcome uh welcome to the channel
12:55 - ask any questions if if you're confused
12:57 - about what's going on the people in the
12:59 - live chat are super helpful and
13:01 - knowledgeable and I also try to get to
13:04 - all the questions as well sometimes I
13:06 - don't get to them till the end of the
13:07 - stream uh if you can't stick around to
13:10 - the end end of the stream just direct
13:12 - message me on Twitter or something and
13:13 - and I can answer your question uh later
13:15 - on so but uh
13:19 - welcome
13:23 - um SM says how would you recommend
13:26 - learning react the free code Camp course
13:27 - doesn't have much on it yet
13:30 - yeah that's true it doesn't have much on
13:32 - it yet
13:34 - um I would say like tutorial videos are
13:37 - nice the react documentation itself like
13:40 - the basic react website has a pretty
13:43 - good kind of walkth through for react
13:45 - and I
13:47 - think I think code academy um has a
13:51 - react course now for
13:53 - free I like vaguely remember taking that
13:56 - course a while back when it first came
13:58 - out so
14:00 - that's those are my that's my best
14:02 - advice and check out some of the earlier
14:04 - videos when we just started this project
14:07 - it'll maybe get you a good idea of how
14:09 - to like get started and then you can
14:10 - mess around with it and that's kind of
14:13 - the best way really is you know use
14:16 - something to jump start a project and
14:18 - then so you can actually start changing
14:21 - things and see what happens
14:23 - so uh and I'm I'm sure some of you all
14:26 - that are watching probably have some
14:27 - great resources too so uh you know
14:29 - please put that in the live chat as well
14:32 - or in the comments this
14:34 - video um kak ask this is react native
14:38 - right no it's just regular react uh not
14:41 - react native yet I'd love to do
14:44 - something with react native uh at some
14:46 - point if I
14:47 - can I don't have any projects coming
14:50 - up at my job that will need react native
14:54 - anytime
14:56 - soon so it might have to be a side
14:58 - project
15:03 - uh yeah coac says uh so what's the scope
15:06 - of this project R react on WordPress
15:08 - yeah basically WordPress is the content
15:11 - management and it exists on a separate
15:13 - server and then we use the WordPress API
15:15 - to pull in all the content into a react
15:18 - site that has server side rendering and
15:21 - it runs on a totally different server uh
15:25 - running node and uh and react uh we
15:28 - actually engine X running as
15:37 - well yeah Rohan uh is is asking we doing
15:40 - browser location or IP based we're going
15:42 - to do the browser
15:47 - location Sam says uh Google Maps has a
15:50 - shortest path map so yeah maybe that
15:54 - might be the best
15:55 - thing best thing to do
15:59 - all right I think that's it for I really
16:02 - at the beginning I I want to see if
16:04 - there's anybody new that has any
16:06 - questions to kind of get them in I don't
16:07 - want them to to leave and you know think
16:09 - they're being ignored and leave so
16:13 - um so I'm going to get check out so kak
16:18 - asks why use a separate react site for
16:21 - pulling content from
16:23 - WordPress if you can stick around to the
16:26 - towards the end I will answer that in in
16:29 - depth uh for now I'm sure a few of the
16:32 - people in the live chat that have heard
16:34 - me say this a couple of times can um can
16:37 - fill you in so if somebody wants to take
16:39 - that on and and fill him in really quick
16:41 - I'll get started um but I'll definitely
16:44 - answer you at the end give a more full
16:47 - explanation uh and then if if you get a
16:49 - chance to watch some of the past videos
16:51 - I do explain it kind of as I'm going uh
16:54 - what I'm doing uh
16:56 - but um let's let's get started so first
17:00 - things first let's get this thing
17:02 - working so we need to get an API
17:05 - key for
17:10 - Google Google Maps so let me look
17:15 - up I like I said the power went out and
17:18 - now my windows are in the wrong places
17:21 - so I had a lot of this documentation
17:26 - ready and now I don't know where it is
17:28 - Maybe maybe I did just close it out but
17:31 - so let's try
17:33 - this um let's
17:36 - see ACF map field there we go all right
17:41 - so I'm just going to I'm using the
17:42 - plugin Advanced custom fields and that
17:45 - just helps me make these custom Fields a
17:47 - lot faster than I would be able to if I
17:49 - was doing it in like a custom plugin
17:52 - with PHP just because I'm not great with
17:56 - PHP so if you're not awesome at PHP I
18:01 - recommend using something like
18:03 - this so let's see here we
18:07 - go so API
18:16 - key all right it looks like I will have
18:18 - to edit some PHP
18:21 - so oh well I guess
18:25 - so I guess I can't get around it here
18:30 - so unexpectedly we'll be doing a little
18:33 - PHP today little WordPress
18:36 - PHP uh this doesn't look too difficult
18:38 - I'm saying put this in the functions.php
18:43 - file I kind of don't want to put it in
18:45 - functions.php we do already have our
18:47 - custom plugin I'd hate to throw it in
18:50 - with that
18:52 - but it somewhat fits in there because
18:55 - that plugin is creating custom post
18:56 - types and this is just enabling a field
18:59 - for one of those custom post types that
19:01 - we're already creating so it may make
19:04 - sense to put that in there I just always
19:06 - hate to edit functions.php
19:09 - directly um especially since we're not
19:13 - really using any of the functions for
19:15 - the themes right now uh since we're just
19:18 - using the
19:19 - API so yeah we'll try to put this in our
19:22 - plugin uh that we we edited I don't
19:25 - maybe sometime last week we were editing
19:27 - that
19:29 - so anyway let's get the API key
19:32 - first and get a key I I kind of think
19:36 - that I already
19:38 - have gotten the key
19:41 - before new project
19:44 - uh
19:49 - CI create inable API
20:04 - all right
20:08 - awesome all right so yeah definitely you
20:11 - can all see this API key right now so uh
20:14 - don't go crazy with it um and this is
20:18 - probably a great idea to restrict its
20:22 - usage so let's do that as well since I'm
20:24 - putting it on YouTube
20:30 - and we want it to only come
20:33 - [Music]
20:34 - from uh let me
20:37 - think this will probably be coming
20:40 - from the WordPress install
20:44 - so so will
20:57 - be get start
20:58 - [Music]
21:01 - and I'm not exactly sure where the rest
21:03 - of that will
21:07 - be so I'm going to save
21:11 - that hopefully I did that right and it
21:14 - will
21:15 - work if we try to use this API key and
21:18 - it doesn't work then might maybe I'll
21:19 - come back here and take out that
21:21 - restriction
21:22 - because it's possible I mess that up and
21:25 - that will mess
21:27 - up us trying to use the uh the API so
21:31 - now let's go back and see we need to put
21:35 - this in
21:37 - here uh I have let's throw that API key
21:41 - in right here so I don't lose it in case
21:45 - I
21:45 - accidentally copy something
21:48 - else
21:51 - and let me
21:56 - grab so I still if if you remember the
21:59 - last time we were editing this plugin
22:01 - this PHP plugin I
22:05 - um I
22:08 - never I didn't get uh FTP working so it
22:11 - was supposed to be set up so that I
22:14 - could use SSH or FTP to get into that
22:17 - server uh I didn't set up the server but
22:21 - um I'm not sure exactly what happened
22:23 - but I couldn't get in
22:26 - so I ended up just just doing
22:30 - this which oops I'm going to have to
22:33 - make this bigger um so I'll end up going
22:39 - to the
22:41 - plugins
22:42 - and where's mine at going to
22:47 - edit and just copy and pasting this
22:49 - which I know this is this like makes me
22:52 - sad to do this
22:54 - but at this point especially since we're
22:57 - streaming this will be way faster than
22:59 - trying to figure out why I can't get
23:01 - into the server uh a more sensible
23:05 - way
23:08 - so I'm just going to put this over
23:12 - here and I'm going
23:15 - to grab
23:23 - this and put
23:26 - this let's see
23:30 - I want to make sure I put it it looks
23:33 - like I can just put it at the very
23:34 - bottom but still inside this
23:42 - PHP yeah so this function I just want to
23:44 - make sure I'm not putting it inside of
23:46 - another function and messing things up
23:49 - um okay this should work also another
23:53 - reason why this makes me really sad to
23:54 - do it like this is this is a live site
23:56 - right now and if I mess this up the site
24:00 - will go down
24:04 - temporarily there is some caching
24:06 - involved so there's a decent chance that
24:10 - if it's only down for a few seconds no
24:11 - one will notice where' I put that API
24:14 - key oh right
24:16 - here all right and after I do this and
24:19 - see if it works I'm going to check check
24:22 - back in with the uh live chat as well so
24:25 - if you're feeling ignored you won't be
24:27 - ignored for long
24:29 - uh that looks like the only thing I had
24:34 - to I had to
24:36 - change
24:37 - so I'm going
24:40 - to as much as much as it hurts me to do
24:43 - this I'm going to copy and paste back
24:46 - in all right so we have this down here
24:49 - let's update the
24:52 - file I'm a little apprehensive because
24:55 - if you've ever worked with WordPress and
24:57 - if you know if you make an error in one
24:59 - of these occasionally what will happen
25:01 - is you'll get this white screen with
25:03 - some text on it I think it's a white
25:04 - screen or grayish maybe and you're
25:08 - locked out and the only way to get back
25:11 - in is you actually have to get to the
25:12 - files so since I can't do that I really
25:16 - hope
25:18 - that um the person who set up the server
25:23 - is still here at work so that I can run
25:26 - in real quick and have him do it so
25:29 - let's give it a shot just I I am saying
25:32 - like you should probably never do it
25:34 - like this this is not the right way to
25:36 - do
25:39 - it all right awesome so it worked it
25:43 - worked also keep your WordPress up to
25:46 - date I don't have it up I'm like one
25:48 - version behind right now and uh I don't
25:51 - want to update until I back up my uh my
25:53 - database so I didn't have time to do
25:55 - that yet so I'm going to back up the
25:57 - database and then I'm to update it might
25:59 - be cool for me to back up the database
26:01 - like on a video just to show you how to
26:03 - manually back it up I won't do it live
26:05 - probably but maybe if I do that like at
26:10 - some point soon maybe I'll record it I
26:12 - don't know let me know if you're
26:13 - interested in anything like
26:16 - that okay
26:18 - so we need to go back
26:22 - to
26:24 - events and in this one let's go back in
26:28 - here and see yes all right so that's
26:32 - definitely better than the big error
26:34 - page and let's see where is this at
26:37 - Marietta hey that's not that far from
26:39 - where I'm
26:43 - at Marietta
26:46 - Ohio awesome okay so maretta Ohio and
26:50 - let's update that I'm actually really
26:52 - interested to see what comes out in the
26:55 - API from this because I haven't seen it
26:57 - yet so I'm going to bring
27:00 - in this I was actually I was trying to
27:04 - get something to work and uh I'm just
27:06 - briefly I'm just going to tell you in
27:07 - case you have any ideas because I
27:08 - couldn't get it to work so I have this
27:10 - plugin called mult it's multiple post
27:12 - types for the WordPress API so you're
27:13 - supposed to be able to just let me see
27:16 - if I can zoom this
27:18 - in there we go so you're supposed to be
27:20 - able to just type in multiple post type
27:23 - and then you can access different post
27:26 - types like this which it does it works
27:28 - like this so I can actually get all my
27:30 - pages and all my posts just like this
27:33 - but if I want to use some parameters
27:36 - here to maybe filter
27:38 - this I can't get it to work basically
27:41 - it'll filter everything the same way I
27:43 - can't get it to
27:44 - filter just one so like let's say if I
27:47 - want one particular page and I search
27:50 - for it by the slug for that page I won't
27:53 - get any posts because it'll actually be
27:55 - searching for posts with that same Slug
27:57 - and it didn't matter where I put that
28:00 - filter uh in here or what order I did it
28:03 - I still got the same result so I'm
28:06 - wondering if this plugin in fact just
28:08 - can't do that maybe it wasn't designed
28:10 - to do that if that's the case then I'm
28:13 - in a bit of trouble because I was
28:14 - relying on this uh to be able to load
28:18 - multiple different post Types on one
28:20 - page which I'm going to need to
28:22 - do so let me know if you have any ideas
28:25 - with that another alternative that that
28:28 - I didn't want to do cuz it would result
28:29 - in multiple API calls but if it's the
28:31 - only way to do it uh then I'm fine with
28:35 - it would be to figure
28:39 - out here
28:44 - in basically in get initial
28:47 - props I'd like to be able to make
28:49 - multiple API calls in
28:52 - here so I if you I've tried to make
28:55 - multiple API calls in here it's only
28:57 - ever resulted an error for me but I
29:00 - there's got to be some way to do it
29:03 - right I mean if we can make one API call
29:06 - then we can make two right and I'm just
29:08 - missing uh
29:11 - somehow how how to do this
29:15 - so so think about that if you have a
29:17 - minute and if you have any thoughts let
29:20 - me know I'm going to give it a shot
29:22 - obviously and try to work through it but
29:25 - um if you all have any input that may
29:26 - help me to work through it a lot faster
29:30 - and I would appreciate that all right so
29:33 - let's
29:35 - go back here to what we were going to do
29:38 - and I want to see what kind of data I'm
29:41 - getting here so what was this
29:46 - nearby nearby event and I've already
29:48 - searched that at some point
29:50 - so there we go that's the one I wanted
29:53 - so let's go down here to if you've never
29:55 - seen this before this is uh this is Json
29:58 - so this is what Json formatted data
30:00 - looks like
30:03 - and this in par normally you'll see this
30:06 - actually but I have a uh Chrome plugin
30:10 - that makes it look like this much easier
30:12 - to read uh but the WordPress API formats
30:15 - everything like
30:17 - this and what I want to do normally I I
30:21 - edit I don't get all this extra stuff
30:23 - that I don't
30:24 - need but I'm looking okay so the field
30:28 - that I want would be location uncore
30:33 - map and really what I'm most interested
30:36 - in is this latitude and
30:39 - longitude awesome so we have that there
30:42 - we know how to get it so let's go back
30:44 - to our steps to see where we're at
30:48 - so uh add map field good that's done so
30:53 - we we completed this first
30:55 - one and so let me
31:07 - all right that'll be completed trying to
31:10 - think I was trying to think of like what
31:11 - could I what symbol could I use that
31:13 - would indicate completed and I couldn't
31:14 - really find
31:16 - anything uh so I know there's some way
31:18 - to do like a check mark or something but
31:22 - it's not really a check mark but I think
31:24 - it's like a math symbol but
31:26 - anyway uh uh now
31:30 - let's let's go to this this
31:33 - part so since I I kind of lost the
31:37 - documentation that I was trying to use
31:40 - let's look it up again
31:44 - and geolocation
31:47 - API let me make this bigger so you all
31:50 - can see and yep that's what I was
31:53 - looking for so using geolocation
31:58 - oh and I said I was going to check the
32:00 - live chat and I forgot so let me check
32:02 - it again got a lot of activity going on
32:04 - here I'm going to scroll through real
32:06 - quick
32:29 - okay so I'm I'm right now I'm just kind
32:31 - of scrolling through for any questions
32:34 - that are really relevant right now so if
32:38 - I skip your comment I I've seen it and
32:40 - I'm going to come back to it towards the
32:41 - end of the stream so I'm
32:44 - not uh I'm seeing them and I I do
32:49 - definitely intend to get to them
33:18 - um okay Rohan says this is uh pretty
33:22 - relevant uh changing the API key and
33:24 - using an environment variable to store
33:26 - it after the video might be a good
33:30 - idea so yeah
33:32 - actually maybe I I should change the API
33:35 - key I don't think I'll need to use an
33:37 - environment variable because it's not
33:38 - actually going to go in any of the code
33:41 - if you remember we
33:43 - um well we put it in the WordPress
33:47 - plugin that is not actually in the the
33:50 - GitHub repo or anything like that that
33:52 - plug-in only
33:54 - exists um on that WordPress server and
33:58 - and is is not really uh publicly
34:01 - accessible as far as I know so let me
34:03 - know if I'm wrong about that but it it
34:06 - should be just enough to change the API
34:08 - key uh if I'm not mistaken but that I
34:10 - mean that's that's good
34:13 - advice I don't know maybe somebody try
34:15 - to use that same API key I'll put it up
34:18 - on the screen somebody try to use my API
34:21 - key uh and see if it works for you
34:28 - I don't mean to order anybody around
34:30 - just if you feel like it please try to
34:32 - use my API key
34:34 - uh I feel like I'm being a little bit
34:37 - bossy today I don't know I got very
34:40 - little sleep last night my kids were
34:42 - awake several of my children were awake
34:45 - multiple times last night and then I had
34:49 - meetings all morning
34:53 - so it's just kind of feeling a little a
34:56 - little little weird
35:22 - tired okay Amelia says uh I was kind of
35:26 - lost but I'm seeing that nearby is
35:28 - already a plugin for WordPress right uh
35:31 - amelo yeah I made this uh plugin so here
35:36 - you can see the plugin it's hard to tell
35:37 - because it's I haven't saved it as a PHP
35:40 - file locally so it's it doesn't have the
35:42 - syntax highlighting but basically you
35:46 - you can kind of see here like I'm
35:48 - registering a post type this is the
35:49 - resource post type so I'm I'm
35:52 - registering this post type here and
35:53 - giving it all the how I want the names
35:55 - to display saying I wanted to show up in
35:58 - the rest API uh and then I'm doing that
36:02 - for a bunch of them so all these
36:04 - different post types and then somewhere
36:07 - at the bottom here I
36:09 - actually yeah I create create new type
36:12 - so uh so yeah so I just made this plugin
36:15 - just to add all these post types and
36:17 - down here I have just some of the code
36:19 - for custom taxonomies it's all commented
36:21 - out right now cuz I don't have any
36:23 - taxonomies yet I may not need them so
36:27 - hopefully that clears things up for
36:37 - you whoa Rohan says you can force syntax
36:40 - highlighting by changing it at the
36:42 - bottom right
36:43 - corner let me check out the bottom right
36:46 - corner I actually never mess with any of
36:48 - this stuff in the bottom right
36:53 - corner what
36:56 - Rohan you you are U my favorite person
36:59 - of the day unless somebody else unless
37:03 - somebody else comes up with something
37:05 - amazing Rohan definitely wins uh
37:07 - favorite person award for today that is
37:10 - awesome you don't know how many times
37:12 - I've
37:13 - um I've had a file I didn't really want
37:16 - to save it locally I just needed to edit
37:18 - it really quick and and I have actually
37:23 - saved it with a file extension at the
37:25 - end just to get the syntax highlighting
37:27 - and so my my file structure on my
37:30 - computer is filled with just these files
37:32 - that I'll never use again and usually
37:35 - multiple versions of these files so
37:39 - that's
37:41 - awesome if that's like really obvious uh
37:45 - I mean then then I'm a Noob and I'm fine
37:47 - with that uh I'm really excited about
37:50 - that all right
37:53 - awesome so does that mean I could do it
37:55 - with this too and make this Mark down if
37:57 - I wanted
38:05 - to and could I then use
38:09 - sorry uh markdown preview will this
38:15 - work oh no did it open a third pane oh
38:19 - awesome so that does work that's so
38:23 - cool this also is a problem too off like
38:26 - I just I don't want to actually save
38:28 - this file I don't need to but I did want
38:30 - it to actually show up and be able to
38:31 - use markdown and now I can although I I
38:35 - definitely don't want it to be in this
38:36 - third pain here I want this to go
38:40 - away and I don't need this anymore so I
38:44 - want this to go away
38:47 - well let me just move it over because if
38:50 - I am going to change that API key
38:52 - sometime soon I'll just leave
38:55 - this should I leave it no I don't really
38:57 - need it it won't be hard for me to just
38:59 - put the API key directly into the
39:00 - WordPress editor even though it's like
39:03 - there's no syntax highlighting it's kind
39:05 - of hard to deal with but all right great
39:08 - let me get back
39:12 - to that's so cool
39:16 - um let's let's get back to the
39:22 - project uh Sam says too bad you guys
39:24 - aren't using them
39:27 - yeah we've talked about Vim before on
39:30 - this stream and uh basically my opinion
39:33 - on Vim is I'm super jealous of everyone
39:36 - that knows how to use him and when I see
39:39 - somebody use it it's like I don't know
39:43 - it's like a when when you're a little
39:45 - kid and you see like the older kids and
39:47 - they look really cool that's like my
39:49 - view on people that use them
39:53 - so uh it just looks really cool when
39:55 - they're using it and uh I want to be
39:58 - like that one day when I grow up I want
40:01 - to use
40:07 - them all right so let's get
40:13 - to geolocation apis publisher Navigator
40:18 - geolocation
40:21 - object I'm I'm sure this is just like
40:24 - riveting to watch me go through
40:25 - documentation so sorry about that but I
40:29 - do want this to be an accurate
40:31 - representation of my daily work and a
40:32 - lot of my daily work is spent going
40:35 - through
40:40 - documentation oh okay let's just grab
40:43 - this really quick and see what we can do
40:46 - with
40:47 - it
40:50 - um actually let me just throw this in
40:52 - here because I want to change this to a
40:57 - console
40:59 - log
41:02 - and yeah that looks good let's log that
41:06 - and let's throw this in
41:10 - here um where we
41:15 - at honestly I I guess I can just inspect
41:19 - any site it doesn't really matter I just
41:21 - want the um the JavaScript console open
41:27 - this should
41:29 - work I'm just gonna throw this in the
41:33 - console yep
41:36 - allow yeah why not you can know where I
41:38 - am what let's try it again there we go
41:42 - yeah I had
41:44 - to oh it just took a minute okay cool so
41:47 - there we go now you all know where uh my
41:50 - location is which was it's not really a
41:53 - secret
41:56 - so evidently this
41:58 - is I mean obviously this is probably not
42:02 - my exact location because it's going
42:04 - through like my my ISP so I'm not really
42:06 - even sure where that would be uh
42:12 - but that's what we
42:15 - want
42:17 - so here's the thing I don't think I want
42:20 - a user to be prompted with this right
42:22 - away and uh I'll show you why if you've
42:25 - seen the site that page on the site
42:27 - before you probably already know why uh
42:30 - it's pretty obvious but for everyone
42:31 - that's new or hasn't hasn't seen this
42:33 - page
42:35 - before
42:37 - um I guess I don't even have this page
42:39 - open anymore uh you know what I wonder
42:42 - if my
42:44 - uh my Dev server was um shut off
42:49 - whenever the power went out so it should
42:53 - be I restarted it so it should be
42:56 - working now and if you want to check it
42:58 - out it's at katak
43:00 - x.com um if you can't spell that which I
43:04 - have to think to spell that and I've
43:06 - typed it a million times there's a link
43:09 - in the
43:10 - description all right so we're going to
43:12 - the events page so it actually be
43:14 - cats.com
43:16 - events okay so here's the events page
43:18 - right so if I were to just automatically
43:21 - ask for the users's location they'd get
43:23 - here and it would pop up and ask them
43:25 - and they would think
43:27 - assuming that this is the first time
43:28 - they've been to this page they'll think
43:30 - why do you need to know where I'm at
43:33 - right that's what I would
43:39 - think hey Quincy
43:42 - uh so uh Quincy Larson just joined the
43:46 - live chat if you don't know who that is
43:47 - that's the founder of free code Camp so
43:51 - um that's this is really cool that he's
43:53 - in the live chat uh thanks thanks for
43:56 - joining the live chat and um I'm geeking
44:00 - out a little bit that you're in the live
44:01 - chat because I remember watching Quincy
44:03 - do a live
44:05 - chat oh I don't know like two years ago
44:07 - or something I can't remember but kind
44:09 - of early on in free code Camp he was
44:11 - doing like a live um a live stream and I
44:17 - actually remember I was like on my
44:18 - exercise bike working out and um so uh I
44:23 - remember exactly what I was doing when I
44:25 - was watching that I don't know it might
44:27 - have been one of the New Year's streams
44:29 - something like
44:30 - that oh
44:33 - cool
44:34 - so I apologize for all the the geeking
44:38 - out I'm doing right here but I am going
44:39 - to read this because it's awesome Quincy
44:41 - says Hey Jesse longtime fan of your work
44:43 - I've never gotten to watch you live
44:44 - before I really really appreciate that I
44:48 - I mean I like I really look up to your
44:50 - work Quincy and everything you've done
44:52 - with free code camp and it's definitely
44:54 - helped me in my career I mean not just
44:57 - just my career but my family and being
44:58 - able to provide for them
45:00 - so uh so I'm going to stop now and get
45:03 - back to my stream but I just want to let
45:05 - you know I really really appreciate it
45:06 - and I appreciate the opportunity to
45:08 - stream for free code Camp uh it's really
45:11 - been amazing for me and uh we kind of
45:13 - got a nice Community built around here
45:15 - so I think it's helping people um so
45:19 - thank you for that opportunity all right
45:21 - so to get back to what we were talking
45:23 - about and I know it looks like there's a
45:25 - lot of activity going on the live chat
45:27 - so I will get to that in a minute but I
45:29 - definitely do want
45:31 - to get this a little bit more done
45:34 - before I really kind of dig into the
45:35 - questions in the live
45:37 - chat so like I said you go to this page
45:40 - right if the user gets prompted here at
45:43 - this page for their location say you
45:47 - know
45:48 - allow allow us to know your location
45:51 - they're going to have no idea why we
45:52 - want to know their location because the
45:54 - link only it's just said events okay so
45:57 - they're going to have to scroll all the
45:58 - way down to here before they might have
46:01 - any idea of why we would want their
46:04 - location so I don't want it to just go
46:07 - off right off the bat so I'm thinking
46:10 - there's there's maybe two
46:12 - options actually three here's the three
46:14 - options I'm thinking about and you all
46:16 - let me know what you
46:19 - think uh is the best so first idea is I
46:23 - just have it set so that when you scroll
46:25 - to this point then uh this
46:29 - fires what so
46:32 - this basically fires obviously I'm not
46:35 - going to console log but uh this is
46:37 - going to fire and give us the latitude
46:40 - and longitude which is what we
46:42 - need so that also I think might be a
46:45 - little bit jarring uh to the user
46:47 - because potentially you know maybe they
46:50 - they're going to see that before they
46:51 - see this so I'm not that's probably the
46:54 - lowest on my list second option would be
46:57 - when they click location for for sorting
47:01 - and I am going to probably put some sort
47:03 - of Icon next to each uh header that's
47:07 - that's
47:08 - sortable when they click here then it
47:11 - would pop up and ask I'm hesitant to do
47:14 - it like that though because I would like
47:16 - users to be able to click
47:18 - here and sort this
47:24 - alphabetically the third option is I put
47:27 - a button somewhere around here that says
47:33 - something like show nearest Events first
47:36 - or something uh I know uh Andrew uh
47:40 - who's in the live chat I don't think I
47:42 - saw Andrew in here yet today maybe he
47:44 - couldn't join us today but Andrew sent a
47:46 - link to some nice um basically form
47:51 - design let me let me share this with you
47:53 - if you weren't in yesterday I didn't get
47:54 - a chance to see this uh I know the link
47:56 - Link at first the link as it was pasted
47:58 - in the chat didn't work so maybe you
48:00 - didn't get a chance to see this but uh
48:03 - this was kind of cool just showed a lot
48:04 - of different way to do tables but what I
48:07 - noticed in here that I wanted to kind of
48:10 - look at more and maybe try to implement
48:12 - was the way they did it's down towards
48:15 - the bottom okay so
48:18 - here so they have
48:22 - this where maybe I could do something
48:25 - like this at the top of the events table
48:30 - here oops and you know something like
48:34 - that up here probably underneath this
48:38 - this um H H tag but right about
48:42 - there maybe I could do something there
48:46 - that would work and it would look nice I
48:48 - kind of I like how that works I still
48:50 - want to keep with a material design feel
48:54 - since that's what we're going for with
48:55 - this site so
48:58 - uh you know right off the bat I mean the
49:01 - button can be anything it doesn't have
49:02 - to look good but then at some point you
49:04 - know we're going to we're going to have
49:05 - to style it so I'll leave off The
49:07 - Styling for
49:08 - later uh maybe maybe I'll do that you
49:12 - know when I'm not streaming uh depending
49:15 - on how long this takes but I do want to
49:18 - have a button I think so that the user's
49:21 - not like abruptly faced with this
49:23 - decision to allow me to do something uh
49:27 - in this case know where they're at uh so
49:31 - let me know what you think about that or
49:33 - if you have any thoughts on in terms of
49:35 - the UI where I should put that for now
49:38 - just to get this working I don't think
49:40 - there's any problem with me just saying
49:42 - this is going to pop up immediately
49:43 - right just for testing that's
49:46 - fine and uh
49:49 - while while I was showing you that my um
49:54 - command line my terminal was visible
49:56 - which it was covered up before and I
49:58 - just noticed that I am on the master
50:00 - branch and I don't want to make changes
50:01 - on the master Branch for this because
50:03 - this is uh pretty pretty big feature you
50:07 - know this is not a huge site so this
50:09 - feature is is pretty big uh in terms of
50:11 - the scope of the site so I definitely
50:14 - want to do it on another Branch if
50:15 - you're not familiar with with using the
50:18 - terminal or using G get let you make
50:21 - these like alternate versions of the
50:23 - project I like to think of it as like
50:25 - parallel universes so if you've ever
50:27 - seen any movies or had comic books or
50:29 - something that has that concept it's
50:32 - like there are these little parallel
50:33 - universes called get branches where it's
50:36 - your project but it's it's different and
50:39 - you can do whatever you want in there
50:41 - and then if you mess it up or you need
50:44 - to go back you can just switch back to
50:46 - your master Branch
50:47 - so that's what I'm going to do now I'm
50:49 - just going to create a branch and I'll
50:51 - I'll show you so I'm going to type in
50:54 - get get branch uh let me make this a bit
50:58 - bigger in case you can't see especially
51:00 - I'm thinking maybe if someone's on a
51:01 - phone it might be pretty hard to see
51:04 - this
51:05 - so just a little bigger hopefully that's
51:08 - enough uh so I already have all these
51:11 - branches and you see most of them are
51:13 - basically they correspond to some kind
51:16 - of major feature uh that I wanted to put
51:19 - in that I knew would would take me a
51:20 - while and I'd have to go back to masonry
51:22 - and make some or master and make some
51:24 - little changes along the way
51:27 - so let's call this
51:30 - one uh let's call it
51:33 - geolocation so we're going to go get
51:38 - Branch
51:40 - Geo
51:45 - geolocation right I was just double
51:47 - checking to make sure I spelled that
51:48 - right and now when I sayp get
51:51 - Branch uh I did that I I know probably a
51:55 - lot of you know this in this is basic
51:57 - but in case somebody's not familiar with
51:58 - the command line to get to do this
52:01 - basically where I'm going through this
52:02 - really quickly um I just type I I hit
52:06 - the up uh key the up Arrow key on my
52:09 - keyboard and I can go back through like
52:11 - my history of commands so very useful so
52:14 - now I have get branch and check it out
52:16 - geolocation is there now if I want to
52:19 - navigate to that parallel universe that
52:22 - version of my uh my site I just go get
52:29 - checkout and there there are shortcuts
52:31 - for all of these commands I usually just
52:33 - use the long ones because I haven't
52:35 - really bothered to memorize the
52:36 - shortcuts but uh just know you usually
52:39 - don't have to type this much to your
52:41 - commands uh goo and also a good tip I
52:45 - can just type in Geo and then hit Tab
52:48 - and it'll autocomplete because there's
52:49 - nothing else that starts with Gio I
52:51 - probably I could have just typed G and
52:52 - it would autocomplete so that can also
52:55 - save you a lot of time when you're
52:57 - typing on the command line and there we
53:00 - go now I'm on the branch geolocation I
53:02 - could do whatever I want on this branch
53:04 - and it's not going to affect any of
53:06 - these other branches but when I'm ready
53:08 - and this feature is is ready to go and I
53:11 - want it to go live I can merge it into
53:13 - the master branch and now that feature
53:16 - will be in master and it'll it'll get
53:18 - along nicely with everything else I've
53:20 - done in master
53:22 - and and I can push it live uh and
53:25 - everything will work so that's kind of
53:27 - the beauty of get uh among other things
53:30 - that's what's really cool about it okay
53:33 - so I didn't really intend to do uh like
53:36 - a get or terminal tutorial but seemed
53:39 - like a good time to talk about it so now
53:41 - that I'm on uh a separate Branch now I
53:44 - feel confident that I can start changing
53:46 - things up
53:48 - and I can start changing things with
53:50 - Reckless abandon confident that my
53:52 - project is safe so let's grab this piece
53:56 - of code
53:57 - I don't need this
53:59 - anymore and we want to be on the events
54:03 - page so let's go to events.jpg
54:11 - [Music]
54:18 - [Music]
54:26 - here
54:29 - and we I we'll just console log this for
54:32 - now just so we make sure it's working uh
54:34 - and then in let's try putting a
54:36 - component did Mount the only thing I'm
54:38 - worried about
54:41 - is I don't think this will fire on the
54:45 - server side I should I should remember
54:48 - this by now because I've dealt with this
54:49 - for months now uh let me know what you
54:52 - think I'll check the live chat in a
54:53 - minute uh after the you guys hear this
54:56 - from the delay
54:58 - um I'm worried because I'm not sure that
55:01 - Navigator is actually available on the
55:05 - server so it may throw an error but
55:09 - let's just let's see if it
55:11 - does get
55:14 - location and I'm going to save that and
55:18 - we will find
55:19 - out I guess
55:25 - quickly oops
55:26 - get location is what do you mean it's
55:28 - not
55:37 - defined maybe it's just what's up with
55:40 - this there we go
55:42 - no did I spell it wrong
56:01 - all right I'm going to check the live
56:02 - chat because it should have been the
56:04 - delay should have been over by
56:05 - now also I want to check in as I haven't
56:08 - really looked at it for a few
56:10 - minutes so I'm just going to scroll up a
56:13 - bit just to
56:15 - um see if if anybody's confused or if
56:18 - you have some really good advice for me
56:20 - or anything
56:32 - oh Sam says practical Vim is a book that
56:34 - changes lives all right thanks for
56:37 - that practical Vim I'll have to remember
56:40 - that one I am serious I would like to
56:43 - learn Vi at some point I don't know if
56:45 - it'll happen in the near future but i'
56:48 - I'd love to do
56:52 - it okay good so Sebastian tested the API
56:55 - key for Google Google Maps and it said
56:57 - refer not allowed map error awesome so
56:59 - it seems like my API key is safe for the
57:01 - time being uh I'm guessing though as
57:05 - always there's probably some way to like
57:07 - spoof the
57:09 - URL and get it anyway so somebody who
57:13 - wasn't very nice and sees my API key
57:16 - probably could do that so I should
57:17 - probably change it
57:18 - anyway uh
57:23 - but probably not a huge deal right now
57:28 - but I'll get it changed here within the
57:29 - next day or
57:39 - so oh okay I just saw um when Quincy
57:44 - first came in he said he uh noticed the
57:46 - stream was going on and tweeted about it
57:48 - awesome thank you
57:56 - um all right I'm almost through down to
57:59 - uh the bottom here with the
58:01 - live uh
58:13 - chat there's there is some discussion in
58:15 - the live chat about the beta curriculum
58:17 - for free code Camp so if you don't
58:18 - haven't heard about that check that out
58:21 - there's um even if you've been through
58:22 - the old curriculum there's a new one
58:25 - that's
58:26 - uh that's coming out I don't know when
58:30 - but if you'd like to help out with it uh
58:34 - check it out do some go through it do
58:36 - testing and contribute and um I know
58:40 - like
58:41 - everybody's uh is waiting and
58:43 - anticipating that new curriculum so uh
58:46 - it would be awesome if you could help
58:47 - out with
58:52 - that last night I actually uh started
58:56 - I started back in to pick up where I
58:58 - left off a long time ago with free code
59:00 - camps um with their lessons because I
59:04 - got really busy and just stopped
59:06 - progressing uh so I picked back up and I
59:09 - made which one did I do the
59:13 - weather I think I started redoing the
59:16 - weather one I had I had gotten it pretty
59:18 - much to where it worked before and then
59:19 - I got really like worried I wanted to
59:23 - make it really good instead of just
59:24 - getting it done so I just scrap that
59:26 - whole one and I'm going to redo
59:36 - it okay philli says nearby events button
59:39 - near the top of the event list yeah I
59:43 - think that's what it's going to happen
59:44 - that's what I'm going to go
59:48 - with oh cool Quincy said uh I'm honored
59:51 - to have played a part in your own coding
59:52 - Journey Bo and I are thrilled that
59:54 - you've been streaming so much a awesome
59:56 - I'm I'm glad I I wondered if uh if you
60:00 - all were happy that I was streaming so
60:01 - much or not so I didn't want to take
60:03 - advantage of the opportunity to stream
60:05 - on the channel so uh but I'm I'm glad if
60:08 - you're all right with that I'm going to
60:09 - keep keep streaming you know I think
60:12 - streaming Monday through Friday
60:14 - is I I I'm going to keep it up as for as
60:17 - long as it's helpful and as long as my
60:19 - boss lets me do it uh
60:22 - so oh and I mentioned Bo if you don't
60:25 - know Bo does all the like JavaScript
60:27 - tutorial videos on free code camps
60:29 - YouTube channel and they're awesome so
60:32 - check them out uh if you can if you get
60:34 - a
60:46 - chance okay Rohan says the Sorting menu
60:50 - and by
60:51 - location um should trigger permission
60:54 - request and probably have subtext of
60:56 - location permission required okay I
60:59 - haven't thought of that but that might
61:00 - be a good
61:02 - idea I guess I can't show you the page
61:04 - right now because I'm getting
61:06 - this error
61:10 - which I just left it at the error for
61:13 - now
61:14 - um partly because I figured if it was
61:17 - some silly mistake that I made somebody
61:19 - would would just see it and let me know
61:22 - you all usually catch my mistakes before
61:23 - I do
61:33 - get I feel like I'm in a mood today to
61:36 - make silly mistakes just because of uh
61:39 - of lack of sleep
61:43 - so I'm getting down towards the bottom
61:45 - we'll see maybe
61:50 - somebody somebody caught it
61:58 - oh we got some talk about web assembly
62:00 - uh I'm not going to go through that
62:02 - right now in the live chat but I'm super
62:03 - interested in web assembly I haven't had
62:05 - time to check it out too
62:08 - much okay so Rohan did confirm Navigator
62:12 - is not available in the uh in node
62:15 - environment so that's what we thought uh
62:18 - you have to use a client side
62:28 - okay Quincy said the curriculum the beta
62:30 - curriculum that I was just mentioning a
62:32 - few minutes ago will come out uh ASAP so
62:35 - as soon as possible
62:38 - um oh and Quincy's going to try to
62:41 - stream uh working through it once more
62:45 - of it is stable that's awesome and it
62:48 - says we're also building a jsbin like
62:50 - interface so you can build projects
62:52 - there that's really cool
62:57 - uh Bob asks it's actually Bob 2010 asks
63:02 - kind of random question but how does
63:03 - free code can't make money there's lots
63:05 - of ongoing development reliable servers
63:07 - at set with very little ads is it a
63:09 - charity I'm assuming that Quincy
63:11 - answered this so let me read down and he
63:14 - did Quincy said we are a donor supported
63:16 - nonprofit you can donate here uh
63:18 - freecodecamp.com
63:20 - donate so I encourage you to do that uh
63:24 - if you can not everybody's in a position
63:27 - to donate which I totally understand i'
63:29 - I've been there uh but if you're at a
63:31 - point in your career in your life where
63:35 - you have a little bit to spare uh please
63:38 - you know spare some for free code camp
63:40 - and uh I like I I definitely don't get
63:42 - paid for any of this so it's going to be
63:44 - going to help run you know keep up those
63:46 - servers and things like that it's not
63:48 - going you know in any anyone's pocket um
63:53 - oh Amelia said you are truly an
63:55 - inspiration with this streams man I
63:57 - really appreciate that thank you uh
63:59 - thank you for saying
64:05 - that oh okay here's a good tip
64:09 - so Q I know I've I've seen your name
64:13 - before and I know you told me how to
64:15 - pronounce it and I can't remember
64:21 - so it's q n o x I'm not even going to
64:24 - try it this time because I know I'm
64:26 - going to mess it up I'm really sorry
64:28 - that I forgot how to pronounce it uh but
64:31 - good tip um if you do controlr it's a
64:35 - good way to search past types commands
64:38 - as well and it's useful for Less typing
64:41 - that's really cool I did not know
64:44 - that you all are always giving me really
64:47 - awesome
64:49 - tips so control
64:51 - [Music]
64:53 - R oh nice
64:56 - really cool I don't know if you could
64:57 - see that but it turned into into this
65:01 - awesome really cool I'm assuming
65:03 - controller will get me out of it
65:06 - hopefully no let's see what will get me
65:09 - out of this q
65:13 - no uh control c yeah control C when in
65:17 - doubt control
65:19 - C and that will get you
65:22 - out all right Rohan ask to zoom into the
65:25 - air oh yeah sorry I I'm really sorry
65:28 - everybody I um I showed you this really
65:30 - tiny error message and I'm sure no one
65:32 - could actually see it
65:35 - so uh really sorry about that so looks
65:38 - like page of
65:40 - events well there's no way I have that
65:42 - many lines in that
65:49 - file so I'll leave this up for a couple
65:52 - more seconds and then I'm going to check
65:54 - the uh the file as well and I've gotten
65:56 - to the bottom of the live chat so it's
65:57 - back back to this
66:09 - now oh Jennifer says live streaming is
66:12 - terrific keep it up please awesome I'm
66:15 - I'm glad that uh that you you like it I
66:19 - intend to keep it up for as long as it
66:20 - is useful to you all I will definitely
66:23 - keep this up
66:28 - there we go uh Nico says what is the
66:31 - editor uh I'd love to go back at some
66:33 - point and see like what our streak is of
66:36 - um how many times uh people want to know
66:39 - about the editor which ni I'm not I'm
66:42 - not making fun of that question or
66:44 - anything because it's probably one of
66:45 - the first times you watched I have no
66:48 - problem with people asking all the time
66:49 - about the editor um but uh I find
66:53 - everybody's really interested in it uh
66:55 - so I was the same way when I watch
66:57 - videos of people doing stuff I always
66:59 - wonder what their tools are
67:01 - so um Don't Mind questions about it but
67:04 - it is Adam so uh it was answered in the
67:07 - live
67:08 - chat um but in case you're watching
67:11 - later on can't see the live chat the
67:12 - editor is Adam I have a link uh so you
67:14 - can learn more about it in the
67:16 - description all right so this has
67:18 - probably been up long enough for you all
67:20 - to check it out I'm going to move this
67:22 - over and see what's going on now
67:25 - I I don't really expect that to be much
67:27 - use because obviously that's telling me
67:30 - that I have an error on line
67:36 - 1,67 obviously I don't have a line
67:39 - 1067
67:45 - so here's the
67:48 - problem I think it's needs to be this
67:50 - git
67:51 - location and I may have to use an arrow
67:54 - function here so let's do this
67:57 - yep there it was awesome that works
68:01 - so it's crazy that that having to use
68:05 - this happens like nearly every time I
68:08 - stream I have some error because I
68:10 - forgot to use this and I still don't
68:13 - remember it right off the bat but at
68:14 - least this time I remembered uh
68:18 - without without having to wait for
68:20 - somebody in the live chat to tell
68:23 - me so I think I'm getting
68:32 - better oh
68:35 - uh okay so C Kno so the I couldn't
68:39 - remember how to pronounce it qox okay I
68:43 - remember you saying like for I remember
68:45 - you saying that now but I don't mind you
68:47 - say it however you want no I want to say
68:48 - it the right way so I'll I'll try to
68:51 - remember it'll be easier to remember now
68:52 - that this is twice that I asked so uh
68:55 - third time's a charm hopefully I'll
68:57 - remember remember next time but uh this
68:59 - is interesting Quincy says we hope to
69:03 - bring back the live stream Summits as
69:05 - soon as we ship beta uh we're all in
69:09 - heads down mode right now trying to uh
69:12 - QA it and ship it so that's that's
69:14 - really awesome news there's going to be
69:16 - some really exciting stuff happening
69:17 - with free code Camp uh soon
69:25 - Alexander says put the editor in the
69:27 - title also and people less people will
69:29 - ask now I I really don't mind when
69:31 - people ask because then often the next
69:34 - thing that happens is there's a
69:35 - discussion in the live chat about which
69:38 - editor do you want to use which I think
69:39 - is cool because people get to learn more
69:42 - about other people's editors Cu uh
69:44 - sometimes people just use the editor
69:46 - that they're comfortable with and not
69:49 - really make the switch that's that's
69:51 - usually what I do is it's just so much
69:54 - easier to stay still
69:56 - right then than to move and try to get
69:59 - you know use something new but if I see
70:02 - everybody talking about it in the live
70:04 - chat I'm way more likely to have
70:06 - motivation to try
70:08 - it okay so check that
70:11 - out so that worked actually I want
70:15 - to let me clear this out because we did
70:18 - there was an error at first
70:29 - okay we didn't get the error again all
70:31 - right so um I thought maybe that had
70:34 - been left over from previously so I just
70:35 - wanted to verify that um and since I had
70:39 - already given permission here it didn't
70:41 - ask me for permission again you see the
70:43 - console log automatically came up
70:47 - here uh for my latitude longitude okay
70:50 - so we're good next
70:53 - step and how long is this been going on
70:56 - okay so we're already at an hour and 10
70:58 - minutes for this stream so uh the last
71:00 - step
71:01 - here so this this step is this step is
71:05 - done for it's not going to
71:08 - happen uh but we got step one and step
71:12 - two are done now let's do the
71:16 - comparison so here's the thing I know I
71:18 - asked this at the beginning of the
71:19 - Stream So if you weren't around at the
71:21 - beginning I'll repeat
71:23 - it I I have this idea and I'm not sure
71:27 - if this will work that instead of making
71:29 - some call out to another API to have
71:32 - them compare
71:36 - locations what if I can just do some
71:39 - sort of math to compare these
71:41 - numbers and figure out which set of
71:44 - numbers has the least difference between
71:47 - them so basically it would be something
71:49 - like like okay
71:51 - so we have latitude and longitude I
71:54 - guess that's the order I can't remember
71:55 - what order I I wanted to get them in I
71:58 - guess that's important to know so let me
72:00 - double check that since we're going to
72:01 - be doing some math on
72:02 - it uh okay latitude first and then
72:07 - longitude so like for instance we can
72:10 - take my latitude minus the latitude of
72:15 - the
72:16 - event and get that and then do the same
72:19 - thing here and get whatever that is and
72:22 - then add these two numbers together and
72:25 - then we can use that number to order
72:29 - everything does that even make sense to
72:31 - me it makes some sense I will have to
72:34 - make sure we have some negative stuff
72:35 - going on here so I'll have to just be
72:38 - careful and watch out that I'm not uh
72:44 - maybe I I was thinking I could take the
72:46 - absolute value of this but that's I I
72:48 - don't think that's a legit solution
72:51 - because we need the absolute value right
72:54 - because that's
72:56 - that would or we need the negative in
72:58 - there to show like
73:01 - um it would make a big difference so we
73:04 - need that in there uh so anyway that's
73:08 - my idea and it would save us a lot of
73:11 - extra API calls because remember you
73:13 - know we have a lot of
73:15 - events down here and we need to actually
73:18 - compare whoa let me make that
73:21 - smaller you know we need to compare to
73:24 - each one of these events that's showing
73:26 - up here so right now it's not a huge
73:29 - list but it's going to get bigger
73:32 - so if this works this will definitely be
73:35 - preferable because doing some simple
73:38 - math is a lot faster than making you
73:41 - know 100 API calls also I don't know if
73:45 - if there is an API if it will let me
73:47 - make that many calls all the time so I'm
73:49 - going to check the live chat and see
73:50 - what what your opinion is
74:10 - uh Q Knox he had me in the in the live
74:14 - chat or actually he or she I'm not
74:16 - really sure so sorry sorry for assuming
74:18 - there but qo says um you forgot to use
74:21 - this so somebody did in the live chat
74:23 - catch me on that so
74:25 - so
74:28 - um ran says he says I'm getting faster
74:32 - so yeah I'm getting faster with
74:35 - that
74:41 - uh oh okay Patrick is linking to a stack
74:49 - Overflow uh page so I'm assuming that
74:53 - this is in response to to how to do the
74:56 - math
74:57 - on on these why do I have this open
75:00 - twice anyway I guess I can get rid of at
75:03 - least one of
75:07 - those says Patrick also says it may be
75:10 - overkill for this but you need uh great
75:13 - circle
75:17 - distances okay uh M Madu I I think
75:20 - that's how you pronounce it sorry if
75:22 - it's wrong says like your scroll at the
75:25 - bottom what did you use
75:27 - um just kind of really quickly you mean
75:31 - this scroll like this horizontal
75:33 - scroll uh this is just this is act this
75:37 - part is all CSS if you check out the
75:41 - materialize I think it's materialized
75:44 - css.com it's a fra JavaScript framework
75:47 - or I'm sorry like a CSS framework
75:49 - there's JavaScript included too it's um
75:51 - comparable to bootstrap if you're
75:53 - familiar with that
75:55 - and they have this responsive table
75:58 - class so I modified it slightly so that
76:00 - it
76:01 - would uh I had some formatting issues so
76:04 - I had to modify that and then I wanted
76:06 - it to work on all screen sizes but it's
76:08 - basically pretty much exactly how how it
76:11 - was for there so that's how I did that
76:14 - and then these just
76:16 - take um check out the GitHub
76:19 - repo I have a function called H scroller
76:22 - I think so check out that function in
76:24 - the app.js file and if you have
76:28 - questions about it let me know you can
76:29 - message me on Twitter and I can explain
76:31 - it but if you check that out it's really
76:33 - simple I'm just um incrementing the
76:37 - scroll position the horizontal scroll
76:39 - position and then decrementing it uh or
76:42 - decrement how do you say that decrement
76:43 - or decrement
76:45 - anyway hey Andrew is here how's it going
76:48 - Andrew glad you can make
76:51 - it all right we have some other ideas
76:54 - here about how to do this
76:57 - math oh Patrick said I actually bombed
77:00 - an interview on this exact question that
77:01 - you are implementing all right well
77:04 - now's the time to make up for let's get
77:06 - it done uh Rohan says we could probably
77:09 - calculate the uh Delta SL difference
77:11 - between difference and sort by sort by
77:15 - that between oh between
77:21 - locations
77:23 - okay all right so let's just try some
77:26 - let's try some of this math out
77:28 - so we can just take these values here I
77:34 - guess first of all let me where we
77:38 - at I need to find my WordPress because
77:42 - I'd like to have more than one uh
77:45 - example here so let me just throw in a
77:48 - map location for let's do three so two
77:52 - more events and then that'll give us
77:55 - uh a couple
77:58 - of couple of pieces of data with
78:00 - latitude and
78:01 - longitude to work
78:04 - with
78:06 - so where is this at St Moville that's
78:10 - where I'm at okay so that this actually
78:13 - this might be a nice case to
78:16 - see to see if anything weird happens in
78:18 - our math if the latitude and longitude
78:21 - match up I doubt they'll match up
78:22 - exactly but um
78:31 - cool all right so there's a second one
78:35 - and let's see I want this one to be in a
78:38 - different place so all right Austin
78:39 - Texas that's definitely a different
78:41 - place that
78:46 - works oh um I meant to mention this at
78:49 - some point in the Stream So I guess I'll
78:50 - just mention it now while I'm updating
78:53 - this uh I just started I don't know if
78:56 - you're all familiar with the free code
78:58 - camp like groups I can't remember what
79:01 - they they call them officially but
79:02 - basically all around the world there are
79:04 - people that get together and uh they
79:07 - code together and they help each other
79:09 - uh learn how to code so you can start
79:12 - them if there you can find out about
79:14 - them uh check out the free code Camp uh
79:17 - website there's a page on there where
79:20 - you can look up they use
79:23 - geolocation to look up a group near you
79:27 - uh and if there's not a group near you
79:29 - you can make one so that was my case
79:30 - there is no Stevenville free code camp
79:32 - at least there wasn't until last night
79:35 - and I created one so I don't think
79:38 - anybody watching here is anywhere close
79:40 - to Stubenville Ohio uh that's that's
79:43 - near Pittsburgh so you might be more
79:45 - familiar with where Pittsburgh is uh but
79:48 - if you are in the area or ever happen to
79:50 - be close to here let me know and then
79:52 - maybe you could come to one of our
79:53 - meetups uh they're actually they're
79:55 - building a new coffee shop really close
79:57 - to where I work so when that opens that
80:00 - that's probably where we're going to
80:01 - meet and uh it's supposed to be have
80:04 - really nice coffee and great Bagels
80:07 - so uh any of you are welcome to attend
80:11 - uh if you're ever in the area all right
80:13 - I don't need this anymore just going to
80:16 - clean this up I don't
80:18 - need yeah I don't need
80:21 - this and I probably don't need that so
80:23 - let's just move this over
80:26 - here and let's refresh this so that we
80:31 - can make sure and just verify that we
80:33 - have the data okay that's first one we
80:35 - had it already we have it here and we
80:38 - have data here great all right so we
80:39 - have three events to test this out
80:44 - on
80:46 - and I think we can test the theory
80:49 - without even writing any code uh because
80:52 - basically I we can just do this math
80:55 - not by hand I'm obviously going to use a
80:57 - calculator uh but I don't even need that
80:59 - I could probably just round this out it
81:02 - doesn't need to be exact but just as a
81:04 - proof of concept before we actually
81:06 - start to code this because if it doesn't
81:08 - work when we try to do this math there's
81:10 - no sense in and wasting time trying to
81:12 - code it uh if logically it's just not
81:14 - going to work uh
81:18 - so let me
81:24 - actually this
81:26 - is this sounds like a job for Google
81:28 - Sheets so let me bring over a Google
81:32 - sheet uh spreadsheet would be helpful
81:37 - here all right so I'm going to bring
81:39 - over Google sheet and I'm just going to
81:41 - throw some of this data in here very
81:45 - quickly all right
81:48 - so actually let me go
81:52 - L and
81:56 - long is that how you abbreviate
81:58 - longitude no LG they're abbreviating it
82:02 - okay
82:04 - um I remember in school when we learned
82:07 - about latitude and longitude I always
82:10 - thought about to remember which one's
82:13 - which I always thought like lat is fat
82:16 - and like the Earth looked like it was
82:19 - kind of fat around the middle and so I
82:21 - remembered that Latitude was like around
82:24 - around the equator
82:26 - and might be a silly way to remember it
82:29 - but it worked for me when I was in uh
82:31 - when I was in grade
82:35 - school all right so there's one
82:39 - location and let me quickly grab the
82:41 - other two and once they're in there then
82:45 - we can just make a formula and that way
82:47 - we don't have to do the math separately
82:49 - for every single one of
82:52 - these and since I know I I know which
82:56 - ones are closer so basically it should
82:58 - result the result should be
83:04 - that Stubenville obviously is the
83:07 - closest because that's where I'm at and
83:10 - then the next one would be Marietta Ohio
83:14 - and then the farthest one away is Austin
83:17 - Texas so we know what we it should
83:21 - be and let me grab
83:26 - let me grab
83:30 - mine and I'll just throw that in here
83:33 - for
83:41 - now all right actually I kind of want
83:45 - these to
83:47 - go shoot that's not what I want anyway I
83:51 - just throw in another
83:52 - row I wanted a little bit more space
83:54 - between here so
83:56 - basically we're going to
83:59 - take
84:03 - um uh right
84:07 - here yeah we'll just put it right here
84:09 - so I'm going to go equals oh this is
84:11 - really small I'm sorry everyone I should
84:13 - have made this a lot bigger so you could
84:15 - see
84:17 - it
84:19 - okay I'm going to glance quickly at the
84:21 - live chat just to see if I'm missing
84:24 - something something like really obvious
84:25 - that somebody's trying to tell
84:31 - me
84:33 - okay nothing there so here's what we're
84:36 - going to do we're going to
84:39 - take I guess it doesn't it might not
84:42 - really matter which one I take
84:44 - first uh let's go with we'll take
84:49 - E4 oops
84:55 - and we want E4
84:59 - minus
85:02 - a and then we want to add
85:06 - that to the longitude which would
85:12 - be F4
85:15 - minus there we
85:17 - go and we want these to be constants so
85:23 - I don't know how you do this in Google
85:24 - this is how you do an Excel you just put
85:27 - like a dollar sign next to
85:30 - it let me well it's worth a try to see
85:33 - if that works or not uh to make this a
85:37 - constant because I'm going to do
85:41 - this let me see what it
85:44 - did
85:47 - E4 so it needs to be E4 every time nope
85:50 - that's not
85:51 - it so I don't really know how to make
85:53 - that eon
85:54 - constant so I am going to have to
85:57 - manually modify that which kind of
86:00 - stinks
86:03 - E4
86:10 - F4
86:13 - E4 it's crazy I haven't used
86:17 - excel in so long like possibly I don't
86:22 - know 10 years or more
86:25 - and I can remember how to do stuff in
86:26 - Excel I've been using Google
86:29 - Sheets for a really long time now and I
86:32 - I don't know how to do that uh okay so
86:35 - let's E4 F4 A5
86:38 - B5 all right so let's just see if this
86:42 - is at all
86:44 - reasonable uh this
86:46 - one yeah actually this looks like it
86:48 - works out so this one was the one from
86:51 - from Marietta which comes in second
86:54 - place in terms of distance this one is
86:57 - the one from
86:58 - Stubenville which which comes in first
87:02 - place in in terms of being the
87:05 - closest and this one is farthest away
87:08 - and this is Austin Texas so obviously
87:11 - this is not like a completely
87:15 - conclusive
87:17 - test it was only three uh three
87:20 - locations but I think that that makes me
87:23 - pretty
87:25 - certain that this should work if you see
87:27 - anything that I'm missing oh I had to
87:30 - just do um dollar signs for both of
87:33 - them oh man I was so
87:42 - close Okay
87:44 - so I think this
87:47 - worked so basically this is the formula
87:50 - that we
87:51 - need that'll give us these numbers and
87:54 - then we sort by these numbers it sounds
87:57 - simple when I say that but if you tuned
87:59 - in yesterday and saw how much trouble I
88:01 - had with trying to sort
88:03 - things you'll know that it's it's not
88:06 - that simple at least for me it's not
88:08 - that
88:09 - simple all right so
88:14 - um let
88:16 - me check the live chat quickly um Sam
88:21 - says you can use Google Sheets it's a
88:22 - free backend for small project projects
88:24 - yes you can I've actually done projects
88:26 - like that uh and it's really cool I've
88:30 - done it before to store form
88:33 - data and I also had uh one of the
88:37 - students had to do a website as a like a
88:40 - senior project like a senior thesis
88:42 - project and he um I I helped work with
88:46 - him on it this was just this past uh
88:49 - spring he he did the project and
88:54 - I advised him to use Google Sheets for a
88:58 - backend and Pull It in uh with
89:00 - JavaScript like real time it ended up
89:02 - being really really cool uh and it
89:04 - worked and I uh when he gave his
89:08 - presentation his classmates were
89:10 - impressed with his site so I was really
89:11 - happy for him he actually got a job as a
89:14 - Java developer out near Washington
89:17 - DC uh which is
89:22 - awesome Yep Sam says you can write app
89:24 - script and it will serve data as a web
89:27 - app Sam says I'm probably going to write
89:30 - going to probably write a blog post
89:31 - about it it's really cool awesome go for
89:33 - it Sam I'll read that blog post send me
89:35 - a link to it when it's
89:37 - done uh yeah you can do cool stuff with
89:41 - um the back like I know I've I've gotten
89:43 - form data and then based on that form
89:45 - data I've sent the data
89:48 - to uh obviously I've logged it into
89:50 - Google sheet but then I've also sent
89:52 - emails out from from uh from the Google
89:56 - sheet uh with Gmail so like all
89:59 - automatically happening so really cool
90:02 - stuff
90:05 - um Brandon says this this site has some
90:08 - js Snippets for calculating distance
90:10 - between lat and longitude cool I think I
90:14 - think this is going to work the way we
90:15 - did it if it doesn't and I start getting
90:17 - some weird stuff happening I'll check
90:19 - out what some other people did but
90:22 - usually I'm all for looking up with
90:24 - other people did not Reinventing the
90:25 - wheel but in this
90:27 - case I thought I'd just test my idea and
90:30 - even if you know everybody else already
90:33 - figured this out before
90:35 - me it feels good that I did it myself
90:38 - and didn't look it up I mean if I did
90:40 - this all the time I'd never get anything
90:42 - done but every once in a while it's nice
90:45 - it's nice to do that so let's at least
90:49 - try to get you know do this math and get
90:53 - that working
90:55 - let me see what time it is 330 an hour
90:57 - and a half okay um yeah let's maybe try
91:02 - to get a little bit more a little bit
91:04 - more
91:06 - done
91:13 - so just trying to think where I should
91:16 - do
91:18 - this I like this git location function
91:20 - being really simple so I don't think I'm
91:22 - going to add anything to it it's just
91:23 - literally going to get to location
91:28 - and so probably want another
91:37 - function
91:40 - and let me
91:48 - see actually I just realized
91:52 - now I haven't merge the Sorting into
91:55 - master so whenever I made this Branch
91:57 - based on master I don't have any of that
91:59 - in
92:00 - there
92:04 - and I wish I did have it in there I
92:08 - really don't want to do it on the same
92:09 - Branch
92:11 - but I want some of
92:14 - that how about this um let me obvious I
92:18 - think this is possible and it shouldn't
92:19 - make
92:22 - any it shouldn't mess anything up but I
92:25 - can just merge the branch that we were
92:26 - doing the Sorting on into this branch
92:28 - and then I'll have those changes
92:31 - correct I'm going to try it first I'm
92:33 - going to save this
92:35 - stuff where is
92:37 - my okay
92:40 - so in my terminal I have it set so to
92:43 - show a little asteris when there's
92:45 - changes uh so it may or may not happen
92:48 - when your terminal depending on how you
92:50 - set it
92:51 - up so this tells me I type get status it
92:54 - tells me what
92:58 - changed and now I'm going to do get
93:01 - commit and I'm just going to write am
93:04 - okay that means I'm going to add and
93:05 - write a commit message at the same time
93:08 - which I use this a lot because normally
93:12 - you know I'm making really small commits
93:14 - and it's fine to do that occasionally
93:15 - you want to maybe break it up and only
93:18 - commit certain
93:20 - files uh you know individually so get
93:24 - commit am and I'm just going to say uh
93:28 - get
93:31 - location yeah get user
93:37 - location that's pretty much all we did
93:39 - right we just got the user
93:44 - location all right and all right great
93:47 - everything worked so now I'm going to
93:50 - merge the other Branch uh
93:54 - I forgot what I called
93:58 - it and events sorted okay so let's do a
94:03 - get
94:06 - merge event
94:12 - sorted uh oh and looks like we're going
94:14 - to have merge conflicts oh no we didn't
94:17 - okay it's just asking me to do a
94:25 - a
94:26 - message I don't know
94:31 - um
94:34 - um I'm always really terrible about
94:36 - merge messages like I just wanted to
94:39 - merge the branches I don't know what to
94:41 - say
94:45 - um
94:47 - merge
94:50 - features into
94:56 - geolocation BR all right not sure if
95:00 - that's decent commit message or not
95:04 - but it's all I can come up with right
95:07 - now
95:09 - so I'm going to close I really kind of
95:11 - wish I didn't set this to come up in
95:13 - Adam it's actually a lot easier just to
95:14 - have it come up in like Nano or
95:16 - something right in the
95:17 - terminal uh it's more of a pain to do it
95:20 - an Adam so there we go yep so
95:24 - you check this out if you haven't done
95:26 - merging before with Git check out maybe
95:29 - like two days the episode I did I think
95:31 - two days ago we did some merging and
95:33 - stuff maybe three days ago so at some
95:35 - point this week I went through like more
95:37 - thoroughly how to do merges so I
95:41 - actually kind of wish I had merge
95:42 - conflicts because I didn't get to
95:44 - demonstrate that live and that would
95:46 - have been probably useful if you've
95:48 - never had any conflicts just to see the
95:50 - process for resolving this but I'm sure
95:53 - it'll happen one day when I'm streaming
95:55 - so we'll get to see it at some point
95:59 - so let's check
96:02 - out what we have here awesome okay so
96:06 - this gives us a much better picture of
96:09 - what this page is actually going to look
96:12 - like once we get all the Sorting
96:15 - sorted and
96:17 - um so here here's what we want
96:24 - we're going to
96:27 - save some of this
96:29 - [Music]
96:31 - data how I going to save
96:35 - this all right so this is the part where
96:37 - I may need your help because I'm
96:40 - feeling really uh kind of tired and my
96:43 - brain is not working so here's what we
96:46 - want to do let's go back to our list
96:47 - just to keep keep me on track uh so
96:50 - we've got this we've got this we we need
96:53 - to compare location so let's do this
96:56 - let's compare this and then what I'm
96:59 - worried about is getting to the point
97:03 - where I'm actually sorting so I
97:05 - obviously need to do the comparison save
97:08 - that data and then do something with
97:10 - that data to sort it uh but then have
97:12 - that
97:14 - associated with the actual of the rest
97:16 - of the data for the
97:18 - event okay so hopefully that makes sense
97:21 - uh to you all
97:26 - okay
97:27 - so where we at we'll just do another
97:30 - function here let's go
97:34 - compare compare
97:36 - location I kind of just want to say l
97:39 - just loc but I've already used location
97:42 - so I'm just going to stick with that it
97:44 - probably would have been sufficient just
97:46 - to say
97:47 - look uh all right so here's what we want
97:50 - to do we want to take
97:57 - are oh actually we need we need this so
98:00 - we need to
98:08 - save I'm thinking maybe I ought to just
98:10 - save this into state if there's any
98:14 - reason why I shouldn't just save it into
98:16 - State instead of just some variable
98:17 - somewhere let me know
98:20 - but uh I don't I can't really think of
98:22 - any reason I couldn't just put this in
98:25 - state
98:27 - so uh let's see I'm going to break it
98:30 - out into two things so it's going to
98:33 - be uh this Dot and let's use an arrow
98:42 - function um Arrow function is going to
98:46 - as Patrick uh so eloquently wrote in the
98:49 - live chat yesterday it's going to
98:51 - lexically bind the value of
98:54 - this
98:56 - so basically this is going to mean what
98:59 - I want it to mean
99:01 - so uh you can check out I I tried to
99:05 - explain it I think yesterday in my
99:07 - stream so you can check that out or uh
99:09 - you know look it up for a a better
99:11 - explanation than I gave
99:14 - so now I don't want to say this right
99:16 - here what I want to say is this set
99:20 - State and
99:23 - we're going to say curly brackets and we
99:28 - want um
99:32 - user
99:35 - lat and we want that to
99:38 - be
99:42 - position okay uh let me know if I do I
99:46 - have to Define this up here first before
99:49 - I do this so let me know I'm going to
99:51 - finish it out with this one but then
99:54 - uh if if you know off hand otherwise
99:56 - I'll just save it and see if I get an
99:58 - error uh and then we'll
100:00 - know set
100:14 - States I it seems like I'm doing this
100:18 - with a lot less errors than yesterday if
100:21 - you're here yesterday you know it was
100:24 - slightly painful uh all the all the
100:28 - mistakes I was making just you know
100:29 - syntax errors spelling errors logic
100:32 - errors it's all over the place errors
100:36 - okay
100:38 - so let me comment this out quickly just
100:41 - to save this and see what's going on see
100:43 - if it
100:46 - works
100:49 - where I don't know where I put it events
100:53 - there
101:02 - go okay so uh Patrick says not sure if
101:05 - it is required but I have always seen
101:07 - the default State get initialized with
101:09 - all the values okay cool I'm I'm fine
101:14 - with doing that I actually think it's it
101:16 - would be helpful for someone trying to
101:18 - read this if they could see everything
101:20 - that is is going to end up being in
101:23 - State instead of having to read through
101:25 - and piece together what's there so I'm
101:27 - going to do that even if it's not
101:28 - necessary so uh so this may not be
101:32 - necessary
101:37 - but I think it would just be good
101:41 - practice so how should
101:45 - I data type onance
101:54 - I'm I'm thinking I I don't really need
101:56 - to set this to anything uh is there a
101:59 - way that I can just set this with no
102:02 - value should I just make it at this
102:05 - point an empty string is
102:08 - that is that legit would that be the
102:10 - best way to do that
102:23 - oh man Patrick I remember you told me
102:26 - I'm pretty sure you told me the same
102:28 - thing yesterday Patrick just says don't
102:29 - call set state
102:32 - twice and I definitely forgot that um
102:35 - it's not like
102:37 - it's once Patrick reminds me of it it's
102:40 - like H that's obvious but for some
102:44 - reason I just cannot remember
102:47 - it all right
102:50 - so there we go
102:55 - so let's say man I was I have uh Spotify
102:58 - going in my headphones and I've been
103:00 - listening to a song I don't even liked
103:01 - for like three minutes and I just
103:03 - realized
103:05 - that I I hate when that
103:10 - happens okay so this should
103:14 - work
103:18 - and I just want to make sure I'm not
103:20 - getting an error anywhere oh here we go
103:24 - so this is nope not events yet let's
103:27 - click
103:37 - events I'm going
103:39 - to I'm just going to reset the dev
103:51 - server there we go
103:54 - okay so it loads we're not getting we're
103:57 - not getting any uh you know error screen
104:00 - there I'm not getting any errors I have
104:02 - the uh console open and Dev tools on my
104:05 - other screen no errors
104:09 - there oh you zero oh yeah why yeah
104:13 - obviously uh it's a number I'm going for
104:16 - so Rohan both Rohan and Patrick are
104:18 - saying use zero it's valid L and
104:21 - long longitude
104:23 - yep okay so let's use zero
104:29 - instead
104:34 - zero okay
104:38 - and yeah so that that reloaded no errors
104:44 - at least no errors related to that
104:48 - uh I always have a few errors when I'm
104:50 - developing locally just it basically for
104:56 - like I don't know where but something
104:59 - with fetching some script uh I think it
105:01 - has to do with me doing it from local
105:03 - hosts and it it works when I have it a
105:06 - legit
105:07 - URL
105:08 - [Applause]
105:10 - okay so Patrick saying in this case and
105:13 - yesterday setting state twice wouldn't
105:15 - have made a difference but in the case
105:17 - where you are changing values that are
105:19 - displayed in the Dom you will cause two
105:21 - updates okay thanks for explaining that
105:25 - so I mean I was definitely I mean I was
105:28 - convinced that I shouldn't be doing it
105:29 - twice just to not you just to keep my
105:32 - code a little more simple but that's
105:34 - that's also an even better reason
105:37 - there uh so thanks Patrick for that all
105:42 - right Quincy says I've got to run to a
105:43 - meeting but it's been a blast hanging
105:45 - out with you all and watching Jesse code
105:46 - live usually I just watch when time
105:47 - permits and double speed thank you so
105:50 - much for uh joining in today Quincy this
105:53 - this really made my day and I really
105:55 - appreciate it I'll see
106:03 - you all right so I too would like to um
106:09 - would like to be gone soon uh cuz I've
106:13 - been at work for a long time and I'd
106:16 - like to go home
106:19 - so let's do a little bit more with this
106:24 - I just hate to leave this commented out
106:26 - so let's at least get this
106:31 - finished and then I will go
106:36 - home maybe I'll go home actually I have
106:39 - to review a bunch of uh job applications
106:41 - for the uh web developer position that
106:45 - um so we're hiring a web developer here
106:49 - and uh I've gotten a little bit behind
106:51 - on reviewing the application
106:54 - and I need to have them all done by
106:56 - tomorrow
106:57 - afternoon so I don't have that I think I
106:59 - maybe at most have like five more to
107:02 - review so it's not a huge deal I can
107:04 - usually get them reviewed
107:06 - like I don't know maybe 15 minutes per
107:09 - application it takes me depending some
107:12 - some people are like really obviously
107:14 - not qualified so I can kind of very
107:16 - quickly ruled them
107:19 - out uh okay so here's where we want to
107:21 - do our math so we
107:27 - want let's see so we want to
107:37 - in trying to think how to do this the
107:39 - best
107:40 - way okay so we have this saved in state
107:43 - so we're good there
107:47 - um it just occurred to me that I I want
107:50 - to be careful I don't want this function
107:52 - to ever be called
107:55 - if we don't have these right cuz then it
108:00 - won't be able to do anything it'll it'll
108:01 - just give different so I don't think we
108:04 - have to worry about it right now to do
108:05 - what we want to do but I I need to
108:08 - remember um there has to be some some
108:12 - safeguard that if the user has not
108:14 - shared their location then then this
108:17 - doesn't work cuz I don't want uh errors
108:20 - to come up uh because of that
108:23 - so I'll have to think
108:26 - about the best way to accomplish that
108:28 - but for
108:29 - now we just want to
108:33 - do
108:39 - um all right so let me think we want to
108:44 - get we basically want for each event we
108:48 - want a value that is the result of what
108:51 - we got you know in our spreadsheet so
108:54 - basically we want this value to be
108:57 - attached somehow to each
109:01 - event so that we can sort by
109:05 - it so that's going to be the goal of
109:09 - this
109:10 - function the end goal will have this be
109:12 - attached to each
109:15 - event all right
109:26 - oh okay it looks like I I uh made a
109:29 - mistake earlier and uh Patrick is
109:31 - pointing this out Patrick
109:35 - said he was not arguing for using zero
109:39 - he was saying that if zero is a valid
109:41 - latitude and longitude null would be a
109:44 - better
109:45 - idea uh it says it says this has not
109:49 - been
109:50 - initialized okay so
109:54 - Brandon says latitude longitude 0 Z put
109:56 - you on the west coast of Africa and the
109:58 - ocean so Patrick says yes set the
110:01 - default to null test against that and
110:04 - Brandon agrees with Patrick all right
110:06 - thanks for clarifying that uh I really I
110:09 - know I said this yesterday I'll say it
110:11 - again today you all are very patient
110:13 - with me because sometimes it takes me a
110:15 - while to get what you're saying and I
110:18 - really appreciate that
110:24 - so let me go up
110:28 - here
110:31 - no Okay
110:34 - cool so here's here's where uh my my
110:37 - thinking is I'm not exactly sure what to
110:41 - do I'm trying to think how do I go
110:46 - about
110:48 - attaching these
110:51 - values these
110:53 - values to the events so I'll have the
110:57 - events
111:01 - already
111:04 - stored they're they're basically already
111:07 - stored in state at at this point uh
111:12 - we'll
111:16 - have yeah we'll have the default stored
111:23 - did we store it on on uh load or not or
111:25 - does it happen when we
111:28 - sort I don't think we actually store
111:30 - anything
111:32 - in do we store anything in state yeah we
111:35 - do on component did Mount so in in state
111:39 - we're
111:41 - storing this props data okay so all
111:44 - everything we need is already in this
111:46 - props data so it should be we should go
111:50 - to um set state
111:54 - data and then it should be like
111:57 - dot do something right so data
112:04 - dot
112:09 - h so I should do something like I'm
112:12 - doing down here basically I I want to uh
112:15 - loop through everything so let me show
112:18 - you here so basically I want to look Bas
112:21 - I mean in a sense like we could do a map
112:24 - so it's going to be this state data
112:27 - right and we're going to map that and
112:29 - then inside of
112:31 - that I want to well first of all grab
112:35 - the latitude and longitude make the
112:37 - comparison and then the result of that I
112:39 - will use
112:42 - this I'll use set
112:46 - State and then I'll set I'll add
112:54 - yeah I think at that point I will add
112:57 - something into the state for for this
113:02 - particular particular one how would
113:05 - I I'm just thinking what what would this
113:08 - mean inside of
113:10 - here or what would be the
113:16 - right okay so I I've explained it about
113:20 - as as far as I can think to do it let me
113:23 - know if that makes
113:28 - sense okay so Patrick's uh Patrick's
113:33 - saying this props data map okay good so
113:37 - at least I was on the right track there
113:39 - and then insert a distance to event
113:42 - property on each
113:43 - event okay good so that's what I'm
113:45 - thinking the only thing I'm a bit
113:47 - worried about is um
113:52 - if I use
113:55 - map will that preserve this or will I
113:59 - have to just let me know so do I need to
114:02 - throw an arrow function somewhere to
114:05 - preserve the value of this so I can do
114:06 - this set
114:08 - State
114:10 - um let me
114:18 - know all right so within here let's go
114:21 - with oops let me do the arrow function
114:25 - so that I can lexically bind
114:29 - this um and let's go with this
114:38 - state
114:40 - data
114:42 - map
114:44 - function
114:47 - and oh actually Patrick says this props
114:50 - data map is there a reason why I should
114:51 - use this props data map instead of this
114:55 - state data
114:57 - map I mean obviously uh the same at at
115:02 - least on initial load props would be the
115:06 - same as uh whatever is
115:10 - in in data but if some other sorting has
115:16 - happened after that point then they
115:19 - would be different
115:25 - okay St map
115:30 - function wait a second sorry I just got
115:34 - to sorry if you get motion sck that was
115:36 - probably I just wanted to check the
115:47 - syntax and I can call
115:51 - this if
115:52 - event
115:54 - right I don't think I will need to know
115:57 - the you know have that I in there at
116:00 - this point I don't think I have any use
116:02 - for
116:03 - that all right so within
116:07 - this we're going to say
116:22 - okay all right so Patrick says in
116:25 - response to my question about you props
116:27 - versus state state is fine but don't
116:29 - forget to capture that in a variable and
116:32 - then set state with the modified
116:36 - data map is a pure function that is
116:39 - going to return the
116:49 - modifications okay
116:53 - all right so we need to do some math
116:57 - first actually I need to look at the uh
116:59 - how this is in the API so we
117:03 - need ACF location map and then lat or
117:08 - LNG okay I'm going to show this on my
117:11 - other screen so I can see it when I'm
117:13 - doing this
117:16 - so we're going to say
117:29 - so we need
117:34 - this I'm just I'm going to just type
117:37 - this out so I get it all out and then
117:39 - we'll clean it up so I need this uh
117:45 - state
117:46 - right what do we call this user lad this
117:50 - state
117:54 - yeah user L uh minus and that's going to
117:59 - be
118:00 - event. ACF
118:03 - do what was
118:05 - it uh
118:09 - location
118:11 - map
118:14 - dolet okay so you're going to do
118:18 - that and then it's going to be plus
118:32 - um okay so that was our basic
118:37 - formula uh that we wanted to
118:42 - use all right
118:47 - so the result of this is what we want to
118:50 - set as the value for and what were
118:56 - Patrick had a name for it I liked it I'm
118:58 - I'm trying to find it in the live stream
119:00 - distance to event so I like that name
119:06 - so property on each
119:11 - event okay
119:15 - so we want
119:20 - to say
119:24 - all right so
119:26 - Patrick the
119:30 - last all we we just got a question here
119:33 - when when will the data visualization be
119:37 - available in uh free code academy I'm
119:41 - assuming you meant free code Camp
119:42 - correct uh so if so I don't know when
119:46 - the data visualization will be available
119:48 - uh but Quincy the founder of free code
119:51 - Camp was just in the chat a few minutes
119:53 - ago and said that the new
119:57 - curriculum uh will be up and running as
120:01 - soon as
120:02 - possible uh so no dates given but
120:05 - they're working really hard on it and
120:07 - it'll be up soon and I haven't looked at
120:10 - the beta curriculum for a long time so I
120:13 - can't say for sure but I'm assuming that
120:16 - all the data visualization stuff uh will
120:18 - be in there and completed you can check
120:21 - it out out though uh I can't remember
120:24 - what the URL is but if you uh you know
120:27 - search for the free code Camp beta uh
120:29 - curriculum you'll be able to get a
120:31 - preview of what it's what it's going to
120:32 - be like uh if if you want to kind of get
120:35 - a jump start you can even work through
120:36 - some of the
120:38 - stuff some of the uh the problems and um
120:41 - the
120:43 - lessons Okay so back to this all right
120:46 - so let me go back to what Patrick just
120:48 - said to review this
120:54 - so we need capture that in a variable
120:56 - and then set state with modified data
120:59 - okay
121:04 - so um should we say let
121:10 - distance equals there we
121:18 - go and then
121:26 - set State I have a feeling I'm not doing
121:30 - this the way that uh Patrick was trying
121:32 - to describe it to me
121:34 - so so uh I fully am am aware of that so
121:38 - just Patrick just let me let me
121:41 - know sorry and uh let me know it's going
121:44 - so this set
121:46 - State
121:49 - and let's do
121:55 - we need distance to a vent so it's going
121:59 - to
122:00 - be this set
122:07 - State
122:10 - data no no no what was it
122:13 - shoot actually we may have there's
122:17 - probably a better way to do this but I
122:18 - just I think we actually have use of
122:23 - uh this value for the iterator because
122:26 - we can go data and then put I in there
122:30 - and that'll give us the one that we want
122:33 - right uh
122:35 - so this say State
122:37 - data
122:39 - um I and then we're going to add the
122:44 - field right
122:45 - so distance to events equals distance
122:52 - okay let's see con new data this is oh
122:56 - yeah con I'm I'm trying to uh based on
122:59 - the wisdom that you all shared with me
123:01 - about when to use const and let so My
123:04 - Philosophy was like I always use let
123:06 - unless I knew I wanted a const but it
123:09 - seemed like the better way is use con
123:12 - all the time unless you really need let
123:14 - so I I still haven't broken myself of my
123:17 - first habit and but I'm going to try to
123:20 - so
123:23 - this state data map const new data Oh
123:26 - shoot that's not what even I don't think
123:29 - that's what Patrick was talking about
123:31 - con new data equals this state data map
123:34 - there we go so he was talking
123:39 - about
123:41 - um which I can use that in there anyway
123:44 - I suppose because it's going
123:45 - to go again so here I need
123:57 - okay so he say don't don't set the state
124:00 - inside the loop
124:04 - okay I kind of was wondering about that
124:07 - I I assumed you would let me know when I
124:10 - tried to do it if if I shouldn't do it
124:13 - uh Pat said after this set State all
124:17 - right so
124:19 - const so this is where we're going to do
124:21 - to
124:23 - const
124:25 - um I'm just going to
124:28 - write write this how your put it new
124:34 - data and then
124:36 - after we're going to
124:39 - do this set state or wait this set state
124:43 - I'm just going to copy this for a second
124:47 - uh oh no I'm going to copy this what you
124:50 - put in but Patrick put in
124:54 - um there we go this set St data new data
124:58 - and then I can remove
125:01 - this and what I need to do is
125:06 - then should this be return instead of
125:10 - actually making this a
125:17 - variable do I need that is is that uh
125:20 - not necessary here
125:23 - I guess I'll hit save and
125:26 - see see what
125:30 - happens all right well no errors yet so
125:36 - that's a good
125:38 - sign
125:39 - but what I really need to see
125:44 - is let's see
126:13 - says you need to okay so uh sha says
126:17 - yeah yeah return it good okay Patrick
126:19 - says you need to return it but you need
126:20 - to set the new property with the
126:24 - calculated
126:27 - value this set
126:38 - State yeah you're right I
126:42 - just I just read uh he says you need to
126:46 - set the new properly calculated value so
126:47 - I turned my head over and just saw what
126:49 - I was doing here
126:52 - realized it and then turned back and I
126:54 - saw Patrick said that wipes out your
126:55 - data so
126:57 - yeah oh
126:59 - man
127:02 - um this is the same thing I did
127:04 - yesterday I think I just tried to push
127:05 - it and get too much done when my brain
127:07 - was just not ready just too tired for
127:10 - all this
127:12 - um okay what was
127:16 - I I did want to
127:18 - ask really quickly so these are the Dev
127:21 - tools for react so I wanted to show them
127:23 - and also ask a question so you have a
127:26 - react
127:27 - tab um I forget I it's some sort of
127:30 - extension I think that you have to
127:32 - download for this to work but I just
127:36 - wondered I can I can see props but I
127:40 - don't see anywhere for State although I
127:42 - wonder perhaps I
127:44 - just overwrote on my state and that's
127:46 - why I can't see
127:48 - it oh no Lyon just joined and said can't
127:52 - believe I Got a notification uh 2 hours
127:55 - in I'm really sorry I um I set the
127:58 - notifications
128:00 - to to go out
128:03 - beforehand uh so I'm not sure if I can
128:06 - do anything to remedy that except maybe
128:09 - uh create the event earlier in the day
128:11 - so today I created it kind of late
128:13 - because I had a Twitter poll on the
128:15 - topic uh so but it was all kind of late
128:18 - I spent all morning in meetings so
128:20 - everything was delayed more than I
128:21 - wanted it to so I'll try to get the
128:23 - event scheduled earlier in the day and
128:25 - hopefully that'll stop the
128:28 - um the notifications from going out late
128:32 - as
128:33 - well okay all right so Patrick is giving
128:36 - me lots of stuff here let's let's go
128:37 - back to this um Patrick says event
128:41 - distance to
128:44 - event equals in return event
128:53 - all right so
129:00 - distance all right lynon says it's okay
129:02 - I'll catch up tomorrow cheers all
129:05 - right
129:12 - um I'm just I'm going to read uh I had a
129:15 - comment just come up not necessarily
129:17 - related to what we're working on but I'm
129:18 - just going to read it right now to give
129:19 - my my brain a slight break here uh uh
129:23 - mamy um is saying hi this helps me a lot
129:28 - and thank you Jesse some things are
129:30 - small and the videos help me review over
129:33 - and over until I see what you are
129:35 - clicking and it is fun Jesse I am new I
129:39 - nothing I know nothing at all okay cool
129:42 - um thanks for watching
129:44 - um yeah I'm I'm glad you're getting
129:47 - something out of it uh I think I said at
129:49 - the beginning this is kind of more
129:50 - advanced stuff so uh if you're just
129:53 - learning this might be kind of difficult
129:55 - I'll try to do my best to explain and um
129:59 - yeah you're saying some things are
130:00 - really small so watch it to see what I'm
130:03 - clicking
130:04 - so um yeah so I mean I'll try to um keep
130:10 - the you know everything as large as I
130:14 - can in terms of font size and everything
130:16 - but let me know if it is really too
130:18 - small uh and you can't see all right so
130:21 - let's finish this
130:23 - up
130:26 - so event distance to
130:35 - events all right so we
130:41 - need oops
130:51 - okay so we need to return the event so
130:54 - uh let me read out what Patrick's saying
130:56 - uh for those of you watching later
130:59 - on uh so he's
131:02 - saying we need all Rohan says got to go
131:06 - really sleepy yeah what is it like 2 or
131:08 - 3:00 in the morning where you're at
131:11 - probably I can't believe you stayed up
131:13 - uh this late as it is so yeah get some
131:16 - sleep I'll see you
131:19 - um actually not tomorrow
131:21 - uh I won't be streaming tomorrow because
131:25 - I will be hopefully taking a nap because
131:27 - I'm going to drive through the night uh
131:29 - about 8 hours uh to take uh my family uh
131:33 - to the beach for vacation so I won't I
131:35 - won't be streaming tomorrow but uh I'll
131:39 - it might be a week before I um I stream
131:42 - again so thanks for staying up this late
131:44 - and hanging in there
131:47 - Rohan all right sorry Patrick I keep
131:51 - messing around and uh you're being
131:53 - really patient with me
131:58 - so all right so events so from what I'm
132:02 - what I'm thinking that Patrick is saying
132:04 - here um is that we need to
132:09 - return where is it at I'm losing it here
132:12 - okay um then
132:16 - return event okay so event. distance to
132:20 - event return
132:28 - event
132:36 - set event. distance to
132:41 - event equals
132:43 - oops let's do
132:46 - this all right this is making a little
132:49 - bit of sense to me so hopefully I'm
132:50 - doing this
132:52 - right and then we're going to
132:55 - return event awesome and then that's
132:59 - what's going to
133:02 - be so event now this event uh with and I
133:08 - guess I don't need this
133:10 - huh uh so this
133:16 - event is now the value of uh new data
133:33 - right
133:37 - and okay Patrick Patrick says there's a
133:40 - big thunderstorm uh rolling in uh so
133:44 - might might lose
133:46 - power uh well I I hope you don't lose
133:49 - power uh for your sake and for my sake
133:51 - because you're helping me out a lot
133:52 - right now uh says he's rolling in over
133:55 - the mountain where if you don't mind me
133:56 - asking where where are you at Patrick I
133:58 - mean just in general uh if you got if
134:01 - you got mountains around
134:10 - you turn EV
134:31 - all right uh so
134:33 - Patrick let me ask
134:43 - you okay East East Tennessee cool
134:49 - um I'm from
134:51 - I'm from West Virginia myself so um
134:56 - not not super
134:58 - far uh from Tennessee actually trying to
135:01 - think is there any point I don't think
135:04 - there's any point where West Virginia
135:06 - borders Tennesse but it
135:08 - it's pretty close in the southern point
135:11 - of West Virginia so
135:16 - um I have been to Tennessee a few times
135:19 - uh really nice
135:25 - uh my wife has has family in
135:33 - Tennessee Okay
135:35 - so Patrick am I am I doing this right so
135:44 - far at least in in this area
135:52 - oh cool Patrick says uh drives through
135:55 - West Virginia on the way to see family
135:56 - in Pittsburgh really
135:58 - cool um yeah I said I'm I'm about
136:04 - um to drive from where I'm at to
136:07 - Pittsburgh only takes about 30 minutes
136:10 - it depends on where at in Pittsburgh I I
136:11 - mean I can get to the uh like the west
136:13 - side of Pittsburgh in about 30 minutes
136:16 - takes longer of course to get you know
136:18 - through the city over to the east side
136:20 - but
136:23 - uh yeah Pittsburgh is a cool
136:31 - City yeah if anybody is ever around
136:33 - Pittsburgh or anything
136:35 - um let me know uh I don't know I don't
136:40 - know if we'll get to meet up or or what
136:42 - if that'll
136:44 - be if that'll be possible oh cool uh
136:47 - coropolis Pat says coropolis by the
136:49 - airport oh yes so that's only about a
136:52 - half hour drive from where I'm at
136:54 - awesome and it's actually only
136:57 - about I don't know 15 25 minutes away
137:00 - from where I grew up uh which was right
137:03 - on the border of Pennsylvania and West
137:05 - Virginia uh at one point in my I could
137:08 - walk in my backyard and cross the border
137:10 - into
137:13 - Pennsylvania I used to like to stand
137:15 - like right in the line between West
137:17 - Virginia and Pennsylvania and uh like
137:21 - say like one of my feet was in one state
137:23 - and the other was in the other state so
137:25 - when I was a kid I thought that was
137:26 - really
137:30 - cool okay awesome so Patrick says thinks
137:34 - that's right
137:37 - uh okay log it all right cool
137:48 - um yeah let's see what's going on here
137:50 - let me see
137:51 - she want me to log
137:53 - it mean like console log
137:59 - it I'm like nervous now every time I
138:02 - type something in I'm going to look over
138:04 - and uh Patrick's going to type in like
138:06 - LOL what are you doing n Patrick's
138:09 - really cool about everything and patient
138:10 - with me but um it's it's happened quite
138:15 - a few times oh cool you went to um
138:19 - Patrick went to Moon middle school for a
138:22 - year in seventh grade oh really yeah I
138:25 - know yeah definitely been uh in that
138:28 - area plenty of times so that's really
138:37 - cool yeah I have cousins that went to um
138:40 - West alany uh High School up there so
138:43 - not not in the same area Pittsburg
138:45 - obviously but you might be familiar with
138:47 - that if you were uh if you were up in
138:50 - that area
138:58 - oh cool Brian lives in Pittsburgh too
139:05 - awesome did anyone go there was a Tech
139:08 - Conference in Pittsburgh uh did did you
139:12 - happen to go to that Brian or did you I
139:14 - just found out about it like two days
139:16 - before it happened and they had already
139:17 - stopped selling tickets I really wanted
139:19 - to go and uh maybe like do some
139:22 - interviews like I did uh for a
139:24 - conference a couple weeks ago but maybe
139:26 - next
139:30 - year okay Patrick says this is
139:33 - uh Patrick Patrick says I'm old this was
139:36 - a long time
139:38 - ago
139:43 - uh oh
139:48 - actually I I keep like think why is why
139:51 - am I not seeing anything happening I'm
139:52 - never actually calling compare location
139:57 - anywhere so
140:01 - that actually here's what I should
140:05 - do why not call I I said I wanted to
140:08 - make sure that we had the users location
140:12 - before we did this so let's just call
140:14 - compare location from within
140:19 - here and I mean
140:21 - right now this is this is happening
140:24 - right away but it will happen uh once
140:28 - the user actually clicks on something at
140:31 - some
140:33 - point yeah uh Brian asked which
140:35 - conference I can't remember what it was
140:37 - called um I just saw it on Twitter
140:40 - somebody tweeted about it but um yeah
140:43 - there was some sort of Tech conference
140:45 - they had lots of different stuff like
140:46 - front end stuff back end all all
140:48 - different kinds of uh like programming
140:51 - things uh and it it looked cool it was
140:54 - held at some like college I think like
140:56 - Community College or something uh in
141:00 - Pittsburgh uh yeah so it it looked
141:02 - really
141:04 - cool I'd like to go next
141:08 - year I did I followed the uh conference
141:11 - Twitter so if you check out my Twitter
141:13 - and uh my
141:15 - followers it's it should be one of the
141:17 - uh most recent uh accounts that I
141:20 - followed
141:22 - I actually think it might be cool to
141:24 - like maybe apply to speak
141:27 - at at that conference I've never spoken
141:30 - at a um at a Tech
141:34 - conference so I think that would be
141:36 - really cool I I used to teach so I'm I'm
141:40 - used to speaking for a long time and I
141:43 - guess I do the same thing when I do my
141:45 - streams uh so I don't think it would be
141:48 - like too much of a stretch for me it
141:51 - might be
141:52 - fun I just have to think of a good topic
141:55 - that uh might be helpful to
141:58 - people all right this compare location
142:01 - all right let's try
142:07 - this I saved it nothing
142:10 - happened I saw no change at
142:13 - all in uh in Dev tools or
142:17 - anything all right I think I think
142:20 - that's because my server once
142:22 - again
142:24 - is
142:36 - frozen oh P Patrick says he's terrified
142:41 - of public speaking more power to you and
142:43 - anyone who can do
142:47 - it oh well it's I don't know I I never
142:51 - um I'm not going to say I've never
142:53 - gotten like that nervous feeling
142:54 - beforehand but I've never um been like
142:58 - really really nervous about public
143:01 - speaking before uh so I I guess I'm kind
143:03 - of lucky that I I just really never had
143:07 - that so it's not like it's not really
143:09 - any credit to me of being brave or
143:11 - anything because I've never really felt
143:14 - uh fear about it
143:18 - so it's uh oh man so that's not let me
143:23 - show you what happened this is
143:24 - definitely not the result that I wanted
143:27 - so I'm doing something wrong
143:30 - somewhere oh I get yeah obviously I
143:34 - didn't fix
143:36 - that
143:38 - um let's see it's giving
143:42 - me
143:44 - f to
143:48 - fetch whoa actually
143:52 - it's saying the
143:53 - fetch failed that should not
143:58 - happen that that seems an unrelated
144:01 - issue to what we're
144:09 - doing I'll show you what I was what I'm
144:11 - getting I'm getting all these errors
144:27 - let's
144:27 - see let me just get rid of this for a
144:31 - second
144:37 - um the old debugging by commenting
144:40 - things
144:42 - out not the most efficient way to do it
144:45 - but it works eventually
144:52 - all right so I mean that did at least
144:54 - bring this stuff
144:55 - back so that's
145:03 - good what is going
145:06 - on let me get rid of
145:09 - this bring it back up
145:22 - huh why is this
145:36 - happening okay where I this is looking
145:39 - more useful I forgot to probably forgot
145:41 - to
145:44 - say 39 event 39
145:54 - what am I doing wrong
146:15 - here uh it looks like
146:24 - I'll show you the error again but it
146:25 - looks like it's
146:32 - saying okay so cannot repr property set
146:34 - state of
146:40 - undefined
146:41 - and us us
146:52 - so is this saying
146:55 - that this is not working why is
147:01 - this oh uh I'm not exactly sure but it
147:04 - could it be since I'm calling it from in
147:06 - here I also need to make this an arrow
147:09 - function I'm not really sure but why not
147:13 - why not make them all Arrow functions
147:15 - and then they all match
147:22 - okay so uh I didn't get the error again
147:26 - so this is still the old error so this
147:28 - is all the new stuff did not get the err
147:31 - so that's that's good um let me do a
147:35 - refresh and get rid of all this
147:37 - stuff just to be
147:40 - sure show you what I
147:43 - got Okay cool so
147:51 - didn't get the error
147:54 - but oh and here we go got it
147:59 - again so I did it was just
148:08 - delayed hey all
148:12 - right fabian's here hey how's it going
148:15 - hey I I want to know um Fabian or Fabian
148:19 - or how do you prefer your name to be
148:23 - pronounced I know it's hard to type that
148:25 - out but try if you could I would love to
148:28 - uh say it correctly so let me know also
148:31 - thanks for
148:38 - joining all right Chen says hello I just
148:41 - saw the stream but have to go now all
148:43 - right well thank thanks for stopping in
148:45 - for a bit uh yeah you have a nice day
148:48 - too
148:51 - uh this is L what looks like LOL LOL uh
148:56 - says I can't speak in public uh but also
148:58 - I need a job so that I can get
149:01 - surgery wow um I'm I hope it's not like
149:04 - anything super serious
149:08 - but um and now the message is retracted
149:11 - I'm sorry if you didn't want me to read
149:13 - that out uh now I see the message is
149:15 - retracted so uh sorry about that
149:17 - actually just so that everybody knows I
149:19 - do kind of read out the live chat a lot
149:21 - so if you have something you don't
149:22 - really want to be read out direct
149:23 - message me on Twitter and then I I won't
149:26 - share anything from a direct uh message
149:28 - on Twitter if
149:31 - um unless you tell me like go ahead and
149:33 - share it um so anyway I hopefully
149:39 - though you all if if you're trying to
149:42 - get a job in programming hopefully this
149:44 - helps you a little bit um or may maybe
149:47 - helps you make a decision as to whether
149:49 - or not you want to do do this I I don't
149:51 - claim that this is what it's like for
149:53 - all developers but it's what it's like
149:56 - for me and uh I'm a a front-end
150:01 - developer transform function position to
150:17 - position all right let me all right let
150:20 - me move this out of here
150:23 - so I'm
150:36 - looking so
150:38 - F so I asked Fabian how to pronounce his
150:41 - name and he just typed his name
150:46 - in
150:47 - I so is it is Fabian okay I'm really
150:50 - thinking there's no way that that's how
150:53 - people pronounce that in
151:05 - France okay so anyway he said uh
151:07 - transform function position
151:10 - to
151:12 - position and the arrow
151:16 - function
151:18 - function so
151:20 - where sorry for not getting this at all
151:23 - but uh Fabian where where are you um
151:27 - directing me to change
151:33 - this because I'm I'm not sure like the
151:36 - error message I'm getting is for this
151:38 - line but I wasn't sure if it had to do
151:40 - with anything I'm doing up here since
151:41 - I'm calling it
151:45 - there you transform error functions to
151:47 - use this set State oh oh okay now I see
151:51 - where that talking about this here I
151:53 - just totally didn't didn't see that at
151:55 - all sorry about that now that I see this
151:57 - your previous messages super clear um
152:01 - shoot you know what I mentioned
152:02 - something about that earlier and then
152:04 - totally
152:06 - forgot uh
152:12 - so all right so let's try it out
152:17 - now whoa what just happened
152:23 - I got some errors
152:28 - here did
152:31 - I did I mess it up I mean this this
152:34 - isn't
152:42 - whoops L 35 okay I see it L 35 what am
152:48 - I oh okay okay shoot I forgot to take
152:51 - out function sorry about that that was a
152:53 - silly
152:56 - mistake
153:09 - okay all right thanks thanks Sebastian I
153:11 - just saw uh there's a delay in the um
153:16 - you know between what what I'm doing and
153:18 - and what you all uh see and here so but
153:21 - Sebastian found
153:23 - that and let me know what it was you do
153:26 - you still need okay and also uh Bal
153:30 - found it as well Brandon says it's
153:33 - pronounced Fabian Fabian according to
153:37 - google okay so maybe I'm not that far
153:40 - off
153:43 - what all right for some reason it's it's
153:46 - still showing me what I had before
153:59 - restart
154:01 - server oh really Sebastian says it's
154:04 - like a 5-second delay that's not bad at
154:07 - times it's been
154:08 - like more closer to a minute so I guess
154:12 - that's good actually the stream the
154:14 - stream Health has been good you know the
154:17 - whole time so uh
154:20 - not bad I was actually really worried
154:21 - because all the thunderstorms here that
154:23 - I wouldn't even be able to stream so
154:25 - we're having power outages but um
154:29 - nothing nothing has happened so far and
154:31 - this has been a really long
154:35 - stream all right there we
154:42 - go okay
154:45 - awesome let's see make sure we have this
154:48 - great Okay so load
154:56 - everything all right let's see
155:33 - all right so
155:39 - my this St
155:55 - see my console log is not firing so why
155:59 - am I
156:09 - not actually I should
156:16 - probably no I don't want an error
156:18 - function here right because I want this
156:20 - to be actually what's inside this
156:41 - um uh Patrick says maybe you need to
156:43 - revoke geolocation off so it will ask
156:45 - you again yeah actually now that I think
156:48 - about it it should have
156:50 - I guess I took that console log out
156:52 - didn't
156:54 - I the git location console log I'm going
156:57 - to I actually want to add it back
157:00 - in because I want to see if this is
157:04 - doing
157:10 - anything um I'm
157:13 - just I guess I don't need both latitude
157:16 - and longitude I just
157:18 - need oops
157:20 - this
157:23 - States um
157:57 - yeah so this get
158:11 - location yeah this is not
158:23 - yeah this is not
158:25 - working let me show you what happened
158:27 - here so I'm not getting that console
158:32 - log of the
158:35 - latitude like I should
158:42 - be and I'm not I'm not getting anything
158:45 - I
158:48 - wonder I'm just going to conso L you
158:50 - know basically
158:52 - anything
159:01 - uh yeah it's not showing me
159:05 - anything I um my my thought right now is
159:09 - uh what if I've exceeded the amount of
159:12 - times I could use this uh you know in
159:16 - like I I've just refreshed the page way
159:18 - too many times Maybe
159:22 - so I'm wondering if this is just hanging
159:24 - and
159:28 - not not getting down to where it
159:31 - needs needs to be to run anything
159:45 - else yep all right so
159:49 - see that worked when I log that when I
159:51 - put it up
159:53 - above above
159:57 - here um
160:02 - but let's see if I can
160:11 - find and I'm just going to verify
160:15 - that if I put it down
160:18 - here it's not going to do anything so I
160:22 - save that I'm going to do a
160:25 - refresh no actually it did work this
160:27 - time I don't know what happened before
160:30 - and why
160:31 - it it didn't work and then it
160:38 - worked oh okay sorry Patrick I just saw
160:41 - that uh your last message
160:46 - so location
160:54 - um
160:57 - always ask
160:59 - okay all
161:02 - right let's
161:05 - see okay awesome so it
161:17 - asks okay so at least
161:24 - you know
161:26 - this this portion
161:36 - worked and so then I'm assuming but
161:41 - we'll
161:42 - check that if I
161:44 - log position
161:49 - that I will in fact get the
161:55 - position and I need to I got to remember
161:58 - to keep refreshing because it's not
162:00 - going to run that again uh I think just
162:03 - if I reload the modules there we go
162:06 - there's the position the Geo
162:08 - position
162:10 - object
162:12 - great all right so that is
162:15 - running all right line 45 needs to be an
162:18 - arrow
162:20 - function okay so it
162:26 - does I'd considered
162:28 - that and then thought it might mess
162:31 - things up so hopefully this is it and
162:35 - this fixes it I'll bring this over so we
162:38 - can all see the result in the
162:45 - console okay got that
162:50 - and that's it we should have gotten more
162:53 - than that
162:54 - right so we should have
162:57 - gotten after this it should have
163:00 - [Music]
163:02 - ran compare
163:10 - location which should have
163:13 - logged event
163:15 - correct yes
163:20 - at
163:21 - least
163:29 - um all right shoot starting to run out
163:32 - of ideas
164:00 - wellow I just checked my phone I have 11
164:03 - slack
164:07 - messages doesn't look doesn't look like
164:10 - it's anything that's serious I think
164:12 - it's all just people joking
164:14 - so not going to look at them uh
164:21 - okay so Fabian says this set State
164:24 - doesn't immediately change the state
164:27 - okay
164:29 - so where am I at with this set
164:33 - state so talking about this this time
164:37 - when I use it up here on line
164:46 - 37 yelden says uh do you use
164:56 - routes a set State also reloads the Dom
165:00 - okay I'm I'm not sure um what you mean
165:04 - by routes uh yelden could you explain it
165:07 - a little bit more uh so I can give you a
165:09 - better
165:13 - answer try to log this state okay
165:28 - all
165:40 - right and this is turning
165:43 - into what the heck
165:49 - much more of an epic stream than I
165:52 - expected I mean I should have expected
165:54 - it more I've never done this before
165:57 - so well my plan for the stream is I know
166:01 - what I want to happen but I don't know
166:02 - how to make it happen then I should
166:04 - expect that it could take a while uh I
166:08 - think my Dev server
166:11 - just needs reset I I know I've said this
166:15 - a million times already but I just I
166:18 - really need to figure out why this keeps
166:22 - happening uh because
166:24 - it's like occasionally it happens
166:26 - frequently and it's annoying sometimes I
166:31 - go uh pretty far without it
166:36 - happening okay that should be working
166:39 - now if I
166:41 - refresh
166:46 - yeah oh goodness
166:50 - okay but at
166:56 - least we got State okay so that's what
167:00 - we wanted so here we console log the
167:04 - state um right here on line 38 so let's
167:09 - see okay we do in fact have user lat Us
167:13 - lawn okay so we have that
167:20 - so we have this state
167:25 - data it it has it has the data in it
167:30 - so I kind of wish it didn't and then we
167:33 - would have found a
167:34 - problem
167:37 - um okay Yen uh is explaining what he
167:42 - meant uh so react router allows you to
167:44 - have routes for multiple Pages just
167:45 - curious if you're using that um
167:50 - do you use the react add-on for Chrome I
167:52 - do have the react add-on for
167:54 - [Music]
167:55 - Chrome um it but I'm I'm haven't I don't
167:59 - use it a lot I'm not that familiar with
168:01 - it is there something in here that would
168:03 - help at this point uh let me know and
168:05 - I'll I'll check it out in here
168:09 - uh I really want to know like should
168:12 - should I not be able to see like I can
168:14 - see props right here is there any way to
168:16 - see
168:17 - state right here here so I don't have to
168:20 - console log
168:30 - State um and then answer your question
168:33 - yoden I'm not using react
168:36 - router uh for this project uh because
168:39 - I'm doing this I'm using nextjs with
168:41 - this project and it comes with their own
168:44 - router I am doing some custom routing so
168:46 - if you check out the GitHub repo for
168:48 - this look at the server.js file you can
168:50 - see some of the custom routing I'm doing
168:53 - uh I needed to do some parameterized
168:54 - routing uh because there's some like
168:57 - blog style Pages going on so um but
169:01 - basically it's just the default routing
169:03 - from nextjs uh with with the exception
169:07 - of uh slight
169:11 - modifications but I would like to learn
169:14 - other like more about react router and
169:16 - other ways to do it uh because I I think
169:18 - I think I'm limiting myself uh by not
169:22 - you know definitely by not learning that
169:24 - I could be doing
169:26 - more
169:28 - um dragos I'm using adom uh from from
169:33 - that's from GitHub right yeah GitHub
169:34 - makes
169:35 - Adam
169:38 - uh okay so let's
169:41 - goes so Fabian said you're logging State
169:45 - inside
169:47 - location with which is triggered seconds
169:49 - after calling compare
169:53 - location okay so should we try it
169:56 - somewhere
169:59 - else should I
170:10 - try should I try somewhere
170:14 - else maybe I don't know here or
170:30 - I me right it should
170:33 - be oh oh goodness okay so when I log it
170:38 - from
170:40 - there there's nothing in
170:44 - data all right so let's check this out
170:47 - so
170:49 - inside here it has the data inside here
170:54 - no
170:55 - [Music]
170:59 - data so we're actually calling get
171:02 - location first and then from in there is
171:05 - compare location so what's
171:11 - happening what is happening between here
171:15 - and here that's
171:20 - wiping that
171:33 - out oh
171:39 - okay so Fabian is saying I need to move
171:43 - uh this function call inside here
171:53 - all right let me
171:55 - refresh um yelden says where is your
171:58 - state set do you have a main component
172:00 - that is housing the state and you're
172:02 - accessing it from a
172:03 - subcomponent um all right so that yeah
172:06 - that did it in terms of you know now
172:08 - we're getting we're getting data here
172:12 - all right but now we cannot read
172:13 - property lad of undefined and that's on
172:16 - line 48 so we're getting somewhere cuz
172:18 - that's a new
172:20 - error um all right so in
172:27 - here event ACF location
172:33 - map oh shoot I know it's happening um I
172:38 - don't have I don't have these set for
172:42 - all of the events cuz we only did it for
172:43 - three of the events so it's it's
172:45 - iterating through the first three once
172:47 - it gets to four
172:49 - it's saying this is undefined
172:51 - so
172:53 - um I guess I need to let me see what it
172:56 - looks like if I don't have
172:58 - it so here's here's the uh what this
173:02 - looks let me scroll down a bit find one
173:04 - that doesn't have this so
173:07 - ACF okay so it just doesn't have it at
173:10 - all so if I check
173:11 - for has if has in property so I'm going
173:15 - to do
173:16 - this and say
173:21 - [Music]
173:25 - um if I don't know there may be a better
173:28 - place to put this if statement so um
173:32 - this
173:36 - oops
173:38 - event.
173:44 - ACF has on property
173:52 - that's the right one right has in
173:53 - property I don't know why it didn't
173:55 - autofill that for me um and then we
173:58 - want location
174:03 - map then we want to do that
174:21 - okay so that should at least get rid of
174:23 - that error because it won't attempt to
174:25 - read
174:32 - that assuming that that was the right
174:34 - name for that
174:43 - function uh Brandon says I think
174:45 - fabian's on the right track try move and
174:47 - compare location call to within the
174:49 - geolocation call
174:51 - bag um Pedro says it's not really an IDE
174:54 - it's just Visual Studio codes this is
174:56 - referring to to Adam actually
174:59 - um actually Pedro I'm using Adam and
175:02 - you're right yeah Adam it's not an it's
175:05 - not really an IDE it's um it's just a
175:08 - code editor uh
175:11 - but yeah I
175:13 - mean oh nice I didn't even see what
175:16 - happened CU I was paying attention
175:18 - ention there but that that is uh awesome
175:23 - um it's
175:25 - progress all right great so yeah this is
175:29 - this is good so we can
175:30 - see that was what was happening the
175:32 - first three actually
175:36 - have have
175:38 - values and okay so we see here so did
175:42 - it's thing it did the math and it
175:44 - actually added now uh this to
175:51 - event so this is this is now exactly
175:54 - where we wanted on this object so now we
175:56 - can sort by
176:01 - this
176:10 - so actually let me
176:20 - where am
176:33 - I I want to double
176:37 - check the
176:39 - state so I don't need this anymore here
176:42 - cuz that
176:43 - worked um but I want to check the state
176:47 - at the end here
176:56 - here just to be
177:05 - sure right and let's
177:11 - see let me check this
177:14 - one there we go okay so we do have it it
177:17 - is there awesome
177:19 - so I guess I don't need this
177:22 - then because the state
177:26 - is yeah yoden said this is where tdd
177:29 - saves your sanity so test driven
177:31 - development you are correct um I
177:35 - definitely want to learn how to do test
177:38 - driven development and use
177:40 - it and it would definitely be worth the
177:43 - time spent in learning it
177:57 - yeah okay so amilio ask the way you
177:59 - fixed is that some events don't have a
178:01 - Latin long right yeah actually I'm I
178:04 - don't think I really explained what I
178:05 - was doing so sorry about that uh when I
178:08 - did we were getting an error and it was
178:11 - saying
178:12 - like basically it can't find
178:18 - I forget what the exact error was but
178:20 - basically it was telling me that this
178:22 - did not exist for some of these
178:26 - events uh which made sense because I
178:29 - didn't actually put in a value for some
178:31 - of those
178:32 - events so when I did this so I checked
178:36 - the API uh data just the the raw um data
178:42 - here let me bring it on the screen just
178:44 - to step you through what happened so I
178:46 - checked it here and I saw that ACF you
178:49 - could see it it didn't even have like a
178:50 - blank value or anything it just didn't
178:52 - have it at all it did not have that
178:54 - field
178:56 - so I went in and
179:00 - said if event. ACF has own property
179:04 - location map so this this basically
179:07 - says if if this is even a property here
179:10 - it's just like it says right
179:12 - so then go ahead and and do this
179:16 - calculation otherwise just skip
179:19 - skip down to you know do the return
179:22 - event um and then that ensures that it's
179:25 - not looking for this when it doesn't
179:27 - exist and then that fix the
179:32 - error
179:47 - okay alelo ask I was wondering does the
179:51 - Google API puts puts the data when
179:54 - creating the new event and setting the
179:57 - address I'm not exactly sure what you're
180:00 - asking amelo
180:02 - um uh could you like explain a little
180:05 - bit more so I can give you a good answer
180:07 - uh
180:08 - please uh okay so Patrick saying you can
180:11 - do uh an else on the check for location
180:16 - map add distance to EV to those without
180:19 - it and set it to Infinity then at the
180:22 - end of your map sort do your
180:26 - sword oh okay so
180:31 - basically so basically saying if an
180:34 - event doesn't have uh a location it's
180:38 - it's going to show up at the end
180:44 - then uh Fabian says argue mutating the
180:46 - state without calling set State react
180:48 - won't be aware of something has
180:52 - changed Patrick says you're very close
180:54 - to having this
180:55 - done I'm glad about
180:58 - that oh Amelia says where does the Latin
181:01 - longitude come from for the events oh
181:04 - okay yeah uh
181:08 - so I'll show
181:13 - you so here's what it is coming from so
181:17 - I have here
181:18 - um in WordPress a Google map where you
181:21 - can put
181:23 - in uh the the city and then so you put
181:28 - it in there and then what you get from
181:32 - the
181:33 - API
181:36 - is assuming you put it in you get this
181:38 - here and that information has come from
181:41 - the Google Maps API of the uh latitude
181:44 - and longitude so
181:48 - that's where I get that data
181:51 - from hopefully that explains that
181:53 - answers your
181:59 - question okay so got Patrick saying um
182:03 - map is a pure function where is he
182:05 - mutating State directly and Fabian says
182:07 - event object is updated
182:13 - so so we're talking
182:16 - about where I
182:19 - here
182:58 - all right Patrick replied right but map
183:00 - is pure so it is operating on a
183:04 - copy alelo says got it thanks all right
183:06 - awesome I'm glad I uh glad I answered
183:09 - your question yelden said I'd learn moex
183:11 - or Redux for way better State management
183:15 - using set state has its flows yeah I I
183:17 - want to go with mobex I um I was at a
183:20 - conference recently and I um I listened
183:23 - to a talk about Redux and mobex
183:27 - showing like the differences between
183:29 - them and how to basically showing
183:32 - comparing like how you would do the same
183:33 - thing in both and I I think I definitely
183:36 - want to go with with mobc so when I get
183:38 - a chance I want to want to learn
183:41 - that yelden says mutating state is
183:44 - dangerous anyway
183:50 - all right so there there's some
183:52 - discussion going on about this
183:56 - portion uh in particular
183:59 - this uh in that would react be able to
184:05 - pick up
184:07 - on this change in
184:13 - state right is that the uh
184:21 - yeah I think that's that's
184:25 - it
184:28 - so so I think fabian's saying that since
184:31 - I didn't use this set states to change
184:34 - the state here react won't know about
184:44 - it so should
184:54 - should I then instead of setting it
185:00 - here should I use set
185:03 - state would that fix it could I use set
185:06 - State inside of
185:09 - this and would it work if let's say I
185:12 - just change this to um set State and
185:15 - then made a distance to event
185:29 - at this
185:30 - point I think I'll just try
185:34 - it and see if it see if it works
185:45 - so this set state
185:52 - distance to
186:14 - events oh okay now I got some answers so
186:17 - probably shouldn't have done that uh
186:19 - Patrick says mutate all your data then
186:21 - set State uh Fabian says you need to
186:25 - clone event objects all right
186:29 - so let me get rid of what I just did
186:34 - here
186:36 - oops all right so we need
186:39 - to mutate
186:46 - everything and then use set state to
186:48 - update it all at once instead of trying
186:50 - to update it every time
186:53 - this for every
186:55 - uh every po every
186:58 - event
187:01 - right yeah I'm pretty sure that's just
187:04 - saying okay
187:05 - so let's
187:13 - not need to CL object
187:42 - all right Yen says um this is why Marx
187:45 - and immutable State makes things a lot
187:49 - cleaner and easier easier to manage lots
187:51 - of tutorials
187:52 - around
187:56 - yeah uh yielding yeah definitely I mean
187:59 - I'm not I don't I don't disagree with
188:01 - you at
188:02 - all um if you haven't seen any of the
188:05 - previous
188:07 - streams sorry I got to get some water my
188:10 - throat's
188:14 - uh starting to get really sore
188:18 - um
188:21 - so basically the story is for this site
188:24 - is it was a surprise project that I did
188:26 - not expect uh it was someone else's
188:29 - project um an outside company was
188:32 - supposed to do it and um basically it
188:35 - ended up that it needed to launch and I
188:38 - needed to be able to do it really
188:40 - quickly so yeah so I mean if I had more
188:45 - time I would have done this differently
188:48 - uh and there are definitely areas where
188:50 - I um I would say
188:53 - like I made decisions based on what
188:55 - could be done more quickly and and that
188:59 - was based on what I already knew how to
189:00 - do knowing that I didn't have the time
189:03 - to properly learn something new
189:05 - so uh but I definitely do want to learn
189:09 - mobex so the next time I do a project
189:12 - like this which there there are several
189:14 - projects in the future that will
189:16 - probably use the same kind of
189:18 - setup I will definitely try to learn
189:20 - mobx and incorporate
189:24 - that uh okay uh Patrick says my bad I
189:27 - totally whiffed on the Clone step
189:29 - actually Patrick I kind of think like
189:32 - probably an hour ago at this point you
189:34 - were mentioning something about that uh
189:37 - doing something similar to that so I
189:40 - think I erased that
189:43 - part that we were attempting to do so uh
189:46 - it's probably my fault uh yelden says
189:49 - you have a store file and all your
189:52 - status there and then you use dispatch
189:54 - yeah yeah okay cool uh so yoden was
189:57 - describing uh mobx so yeah I umum I have
190:01 - to look I took a lot of notes at the
190:02 - talk that I went to that uh talked about
190:04 - mobx and hopefully they're going to
190:06 - release the videos for that talk at some
190:08 - point it was syntax con was the
190:11 - conference so uh then maybe I can watch
190:13 - the video again uh and or check out a
190:17 - lot of the other video tutorials uh
190:19 - Fabian says it's important to clone
190:21 - because set state will compare Old State
190:23 - with new one but if you alter the Old
190:25 - State react won't be able to know what
190:27 - really changed Okay cool so um I'm going
190:30 - to ask a very probably aish question
190:33 - here uh but just for the sake of getting
190:36 - this done on
190:38 - time what's the best way like how should
190:41 - I clone this in terms of like what what
190:45 - syntax do I use
190:51 - um yelden also ask on this site do you
190:54 - know the users because i1 still does not
190:57 - Support es6 classes unless you use Babel
191:01 - so yeah I'm I am using Babel
191:04 - so
191:05 - um
191:07 - next
191:09 - JS uh automatically handles a lot of
191:12 - that stuff so actually don't yeah we
191:16 - tested this site 11 at some point I
191:18 - think we went through some
191:20 - testing
191:22 - so yeah we did so it doesn't actually
191:25 - the worst part of the site is some of
191:27 - the CSS because I'm using flexbox for
191:29 - some things and that doesn't work in i11
191:31 - so
191:36 - um yeah so I mean realistically uh my
191:40 - boss is not concerned about me making
191:43 - things work in
191:45 - ie1 uh his his Viewpoint is it would
191:50 - probably be better for people to just
191:51 - update their browsers anyway if possible
191:54 - so and they're probably used to other
191:56 - parts of the internet work not working
191:58 - correctly so um it it somewhat does
192:01 - depend on our audience though
192:03 - realistically but uh in
192:05 - general if it's not going to cause a
192:07 - huge problem with our our audience
192:11 - um it does seem almost like uh
192:17 - I don't know in in a it kind of in a way
192:19 - it seems like it's
192:23 - better I'm I'm torn between this because
192:25 - part of me is like don't support i11 and
192:29 - put the pressure on everyone to upgrade
192:33 - i11 uh and use something that's better
192:37 - and I mean let's face it more secure
192:39 - right I mean you have less of a chance
192:41 - of getting malware and stuff if you have
192:44 - a newer browser too so it's not just a
192:47 - like I want to do cool stuff you know
192:49 - forget your old browser
192:51 - it's uh people need a reminder that you
192:56 - should be updating these things uh but
192:58 - then the other part of me is like I want
193:00 - everybody possible to be able to have
193:02 - the best experience on my site so I want
193:03 - to support all these older browsers so
193:06 - I'm a little bit torn between the
193:08 - two uh so I just I just kind of consider
193:12 - who the audience is and like when I make
193:14 - sites internally for the University here
193:17 - I have no problem just throwing up a b
193:20 - like a popup at the beginning saying
193:22 - like hey you're using an old browser you
193:24 - need to update this
193:26 - because I mean that's the security issue
193:28 - like I've had people
193:30 - using insanely old browsers like
193:33 - browsers that haven't been updated in
193:35 - seven
193:36 - years and um that's just unacceptable
193:40 - like at at the University I
193:43 - have gotten like bug reports and it says
193:46 - that they're using using browsers that
193:49 - are 7 years old and that's just crazy we
193:52 - can't
193:54 - like we can't have browsers that are 7
193:56 - years old running on our computers here
193:59 - at the University so at some point we
194:02 - just have to force people to update so
194:06 - um anyway so sorry for the the rant on
194:10 - the side there
194:20 - okay so faban did answer my question
194:23 - that was more to the point before I went
194:25 - on my my little um Sidetrack thing here
194:29 - so he's
194:31 - saying um oh cool you're using the
194:34 - spread operator yeah awesome always love
194:37 - an excuse to use new features all right
194:41 - so let's do this uh so
194:45 - Fabian where are we at cons event clone
194:48 - event okay so let's
194:59 - do I'm assuming this has to be in here
195:01 - this seems like the only reason we'll
195:02 - place to put it to me not that I thought
195:05 - that much about it but
195:08 - uh
195:10 - const
195:13 - event
195:15 - clone equals
195:24 - cool okay all right so this is the
195:28 - spread operator oh Yen says spread
195:31 - operators love and template strings yeah
195:34 - for sure for sure I agree with you
195:40 - 100% okay so number one is this actually
195:44 - where I was supposed to put it I think
195:45 - so number two um we have event clone so
195:49 - does that mean now I should
195:54 - change this to event
195:57 - cloned and
196:02 - then and then at some point after I've
196:05 - changed event cloned then I set
196:09 - State I think I got this
196:13 - now I have I have the concept of what's
196:15 - Happening Now
196:22 - um let's let's
196:26 - try uh where am I at and
196:32 - now a map event return
196:36 - event
196:39 - cloned
196:41 - and this set whoops set state
196:56 - events
196:57 - oops is this what I really
197:02 - want
197:04 - no cuz I don't have a event I want
197:20 - yeah this isn't what I want I messed up
197:21 - at some point
197:32 - right okay I did
197:35 - forget there we
197:38 - go CL
197:40 - event
197:43 - cloned distance to event all right now
197:46 - we're returning turning from this event
197:49 - Clon great
197:57 - and
197:58 - [Music]
198:06 - now am I good so on line 50 do I have
198:09 - the right idea
198:11 - here of
198:16 - all right Andre says there's an error on
198:18 - line 44 what I
198:21 - got which's uh let's see saying objects
198:25 - are not
198:28 - iterable anyway hi Andre welcome I don't
198:31 - I don't remember uh seen you commenting
198:34 - before if you have sorry uh but anyway
198:37 - welcome welcome to the uh live stream uh
198:40 - thanks
198:41 - for for helping
198:44 - out okay spread operators for arrays
198:47 - okay and this is
198:51 - not not
198:55 - arrays oh it is first time awesome Andre
198:58 - welcome welcome I appreciate you uh you
199:03 - watching um is this your first time uh
199:06 - in case you didn't realize it already uh
199:09 - I I don't claim to be an expert this is
199:11 - just me doing my daily work and
199:13 - occasionally like today I attempt to do
199:15 - something that I really have no idea how
199:17 - to do and um usually everybody in the
199:21 - live chat gives me a lot of help
199:23 - sometimes I do things where I really do
199:25 - know what I'm doing and um it's probably
199:28 - more more useful to everyone watching
199:31 - this is one of the days where I'm
199:33 - getting a lot of benefit from from your
199:41 - expertise all right awesome
199:45 - so Ian saying the spread operator works
199:49 - also with objects
199:51 - now
199:56 - cool okay
199:58 - so my last question I I think I've I've
200:03 - changed
200:05 - events NOP I need to change it I guess
200:10 - it doesn't really matter if I change it
200:12 - here or not but I'm going to just for
200:15 - consistency event clone
200:26 - okay if not use cloned equals object
200:29 - assigned event and it's the same okay so
200:32 - fabian's giving an alternative in case
200:34 - the spread operator is not going to work
200:36 - uh for this
200:38 - so I mean actually
200:41 - this I guess I
200:44 - can this EST State event
200:49 - wait a
201:10 - second all right here's where I
201:14 - am oops
201:18 - sorry uh this set
201:21 - State I missed a few things in the live
201:23 - chat here I got to go back and see
201:24 - what's going on uh Patrick says this.
201:27 - set State uh new data and Fabian says
201:31 - and finally this do set State uh. data
201:36 - uh
201:37 - new new date um Patrick don't forget to
201:41 - name the property in this case
201:44 - yes um and ask what do you use to expose
201:49 - Advanced custom fields to WP API uh
201:51 - there's a plugin uh for I I mumbled that
201:55 - sorry Philip ask what do you use to
201:57 - expose Advanced custom fields in the
202:00 - WordPress API there is a
202:03 - plugin uh to expose Advanced custom
202:06 - Fields so I don't remember which plugin
202:09 - I use for sure uh
202:12 - so I
202:14 - can I can check it out when I finish
202:17 - this I kind of want to finish this right
202:18 - now uh before I go back to the WordPress
202:21 - thing but if you stick around for a
202:22 - couple of minutes hopefully it only
202:24 - takes a few minutes to get this this
202:27 - working and then I can check WordPress
202:28 - for you before I end the
202:32 - stream okay Patrick's new day data
202:35 - though
202:37 - um uh yelden said I tried to use spread
202:40 - on an object it doesn't work uh Patrick
202:45 - says are you using a weing a
202:49 - transpiler and um theen says
202:54 - yes oh okay philli just says was
202:57 - wondering if uh I wrote the Plugin or if
202:59 - there was a plugin yeah I didn't write
203:01 - that plugin I got it from from somewhere
203:03 - else
203:05 - so thaton okay all right we're have so
203:09 - there's there's a big discussion still
203:11 - about the um in the live chat about the
203:14 - spread operator um and whether or not
203:16 - this will work so actually let
203:28 - me let's just check this out hopefully I
203:30 - didn't do a lot to break ah
203:34 - shoot I broke I did too much to break
203:37 - this so
203:51 - just gonna get rid of this for now just
203:53 - so I can
204:00 - see what is going
204:09 - on
204:14 - whoops I need
204:19 - and actually I need this
204:30 - stuff
204:31 - okay that should do
204:45 - it oh shoot what is problem here
205:30 - okay
205:31 - so
205:32 - just I don't know if this will help your
205:35 - discussion about the spread operator
205:38 - but basically I am console logging event
205:44 - cloned just to see what it's giving me
205:48 - and here's what I get I get this object
205:52 - here um with all my
205:56 - stuff is that what uh uh Fabian is that
206:00 - what you expecting to see
206:26 - okay so
206:28 - basic say see yeah I sorry everybody I
206:32 - kind of ignored the live chat for a
206:34 - minute because I just thought there's
206:36 - definitely one way to solve this
206:38 - discussion just console log it and see
206:41 - what's going on okay
206:43 - so at least we now know that yes indeed
206:46 - we we do have a uh a copy
206:49 - of of event now so
206:54 - here's here's my question
206:57 - so this part I'm assuming is uh
207:02 - correct uh the part that I'm
207:05 - still I don't know about
207:08 - is now I need to after this all happens
207:12 - I need to set the
207:13 - state uh how do I
207:19 - how do I do and I'm sorry if you've
207:21 - already put this in the live chat this
207:23 - is one of those times where I'm I'm
207:25 - honestly slightly lost right now so uh
207:28 - please be patient with
207:31 - me I will say this though uh when I do
207:35 - streams like this where I am kind of
207:37 - lost for a lot of the time I learn a
207:40 - lot and uh I often don't don't really
207:44 - need um like the next time I do it I
207:48 - remember it and can look back and do it
207:50 - so all right so Fabian
207:54 - saying uh and Patrick are both saying
207:58 - saying this which okay now that now that
208:00 - you put that in there I remember uh you
208:02 - both pasted something like you pasted
208:05 - that in before or you uh wrote that in
208:07 - before so sorry for making you do that
208:10 - again
208:12 - um so is this what is this the right
208:15 - location for for this I mean I'm going
208:18 - to save it and just see if I get a bunch
208:20 - of errors all right lots of
208:33 - Errors now Yen says struggle helps yes
208:36 - it does for sure I mean it takes a long
208:40 - time it can be painful but it takes long
208:43 - time okay so all right so Patrick saying
208:46 - yes this is the race place to do
208:49 - that um oh my goodness now I it just
208:53 - clicked for me uh so in case it was
208:57 - confusing to anyone else
208:59 - watching here's what just clicked for me
209:02 - and this may have been obvious to you
209:04 - but the whole time I'm thinking like
209:07 - that I'm going to have to say set set
209:09 - State and somehow I'm going to set the
209:12 - state of event to event clone but then
209:14 - it occurred to me like wait a second
209:16 - there is no State event right this is
209:19 - this doesn't make any sense forgetting
209:22 - completely that this whole thing we
209:25 - named new data right
209:29 - so anyway
209:33 - um yeah
209:38 - so I I just needed to set data to new
209:41 - data and not anyway so hopefully you can
209:45 - see that that I finally just realized
209:47 - that
209:51 - um so anyway I wish I would have seen
209:54 - that like 15 minutes
209:57 - ago but oh well been staring at this for
210:00 - a long time now
210:02 - so okay but I am all right let me show
210:04 - you the errors that I'm getting right
210:07 - now
210:12 - and so unexpected character at line
210:18 - 54 the set State data new
210:22 - data
210:44 - um um
210:49 - Fabian says uh we had some some people
210:51 - asking about my uh my code editor again
210:55 - um Fabian says put it put Adam in the
210:57 - FAQ I have it in the description
211:00 - actually so um I don't mind people
211:02 - asking about it
211:04 - but uh today is it's actually like every
211:07 - half hour or so I think somebody asks
211:09 - about it which is totally cool I mean
211:11 - somebody has never watched the show
211:13 - before uh you know the stream off
211:15 - obviously wouldn't know uh I'm actually
211:18 - I kind of like that more people new it
211:21 - tells me that new people are joining
211:24 - because uh they're asking about the
211:28 - editor uh Patrick says to be fair I'm
211:30 - not talking commenting answering
211:32 - questions and typing while trying to
211:34 - code you have the harder job here yeah
211:38 - well that makes me feel a little bit
211:39 - better thanks for that Patrick uh I I
211:41 - will say like for sure I work I
211:45 - definitely work faster when I'm not
211:50 - streaming uh but I think it's a good
211:52 - tradeoff because I learn a lot when I do
211:55 - streams like this so I think the long
212:00 - run net effect is that more get a lot
212:03 - more gets done and the end result is a
212:08 - lot better than it would have been if I
212:09 - would just kind of do my own thing all
212:12 - the time and not stream especially with
212:14 - some of the pool requests that you have
212:16 - submitted they're just really amazing
212:17 - and uh I actually like I go through line
212:20 - by line and and try to understand what
212:22 - you're doing and I've learned a lot from
212:24 - that uh I really appreciate that okay
212:28 - so I showed you my um my error
212:34 - here so I got something going on with
212:36 - this set State uh maybe I messed
212:38 - something up when I
212:40 - was changing some things let me see okay
212:43 - so that's good
212:46 - we have
212:48 - this this oops yeah that looks
212:57 - good oh am I
213:00 - missing I think I'm I'm missing
213:07 - a
213:14 - p no I wasn't it was right here I was
213:17 - mistaken uh so that yeah this is closed
213:20 - this is
213:23 - closed all right so it's not like some
213:25 - obvious uh you know like
213:29 - missing
213:31 - curly curly
213:33 - bracket okay uh I'm gonna I'm G to
213:36 - check Fabian says yes courage
213:40 - Jess uh Brandon says streaming is smart
213:43 - you get free help while getting paid to
213:45 - do the job
213:46 - yeah yeah I mean I kind of like to think
213:49 - that I help people too but you're are
213:51 - right Brandon a lot of times I'm I'm
213:53 - getting help uh I'm getting a lot of
213:55 - help and um that's true I'm getting paid
213:58 - for it that's why I did have when I
214:00 - first started streaming I had some
214:01 - people ask about like like giving me
214:04 - donations and stuff and uh I I mentioned
214:07 - a couple
214:08 - times I'm getting paid right now because
214:12 - this is my my regular work so I just I
214:14 - don't really feel like
214:16 - I should take any money if I'm getting
214:18 - paid to do this at some point if I start
214:21 - doing like lots of streams like from
214:24 - home on my free time then maybe I'll
214:27 - think of some way to make money off of
214:30 - it uh if anything
214:34 - just uh I guarantee if I spent my time
214:37 - at home doing streams and videos my wife
214:39 - would get upset pretty quickly but at
214:41 - least if I could say like hey I'm
214:43 - bringing in more income she'd be a
214:44 - little bit happier
214:50 - I don't think she's listening to this if
214:52 - if you are listening back then you could
214:54 - let me know if that's the
215:00 - case oh okay Fabian all
215:04 - right uh I did copy so Fabian says did
215:07 - you copy this set state from chat it
215:09 - seems an invisible character uh has been
215:11 - put in yes yeah okay that explains it so
215:16 - so that's why I say unexpected character
215:18 - and it just says this uh right right
215:21 - here okay
215:24 - so awesome uh so let
215:29 - me um let me just get rid of all this
215:33 - and I'll type it out and then that way I
215:35 - should
215:37 - be pretty sure that I'm going to do it
215:41 - so this
215:43 - dot set state
215:50 - and I'm going to
215:53 - go
215:55 - data new
215:58 - data
216:01 - okay you could see I'm still trying to
216:04 - break myself with the semicolon habit if
216:06 - you notice occasionally when I get to
216:08 - the end like this I tab over I go over
216:12 - because I'm getting ready to put the
216:13 - semicolon in but I stopped myself
216:16 - all right let's
216:21 - see all right so I'm not getting that
216:23 - error again I got a different error but
216:27 - I don't think it's um I don't I don't
216:30 - think it's affecting the
216:31 - page
216:33 - negatively
216:36 - um all right so let's check this out let
216:39 - me show you what I got I got this error
216:43 - but I think that's at events
216:47 - 4 what the heck is at events
216:50 - 4 oh it's something about the sticky n
216:53 - yeah that's that's probably just has
216:55 - something to do with the uh hot module
216:57 - reloading and occasionally I get weird
216:59 - errors with
217:01 - that but of course I never get them you
217:04 - know on the live site because I'm not
217:05 - doing the hot modle reloading there uh
217:09 - okay that's
217:11 - better cool so let's
217:19 - now that we have
217:21 - this this let say data new data
217:37 - okay uh awesome job uh Fabian at
217:40 - catching that by the way CU that that
217:42 - was definitely the problem uh Alberto
217:44 - says yay for non-display characters I'm
217:46 - currently doing a lot of parsing um
217:51 - on uh sln a andf in my current project
217:57 - um okay so at this point I really wanted
218:02 - to actually get the sorted sorting
218:03 - working
218:05 - but honestly it's like almost 6:00 p.m.
218:09 - at my time and
218:13 - um I got in like
218:17 - trying to think how long I've been here
218:19 - at this point um I'm definitely I'm I'm
218:23 - definitely way past the uh amount of
218:25 - time
218:26 - that I am supposed to work and I expect
218:30 - that my wife is wondering where I am so
218:34 - I think I'm going to cut it short I
218:35 - really hate to leave it like right in
218:37 - the middle like this um especially since
218:40 - I'm not going to stream for a while
218:42 - so I'm going to do my best um when I I'm
218:47 - I I probably won't get to it for till
218:50 - after I get back from vacation but I
218:52 - want to do my best to actually now make
218:54 - this work with the
218:56 - sworting and uh thanks actually Patrick
219:00 - says sword
219:02 - AB uh a distance to event B distance to
219:06 - event hey distance to
219:09 - event okay so actually maybe I will sort
219:12 - it because Patrick just gave me what I
219:14 - need
219:18 - in
219:19 - here so um let's
219:23 - see so Patrick if I do the
219:37 - Sorting all right so let me paste in
219:39 - what Patrick just just so everybody can
219:41 - see this Patrick just uh pasted this in
219:48 - and but you need an else on location map
219:51 - that sets the distance to event on
219:55 - others okay cool um yeah I'm definitely
219:59 - uh I'm not going to have time to
220:01 - influent this so I am going
220:03 - to leave this in here like this just so
220:06 - that I mean normally I don't really like
220:08 - leaving in like partial code and
220:10 - commenting it out uh but in this case
220:13 - this is probably the best place for me
220:14 - to put it so I'll actually
220:16 - remember uh
220:18 - so at least I'll know where to go
220:23 - from um so this he is it you know put it
220:27 - above set state which makes sense uh so
220:31 - that basically uh if you're watching
220:33 - just just for explanation of uh in case
220:37 - I don't finish this in a stream and I
220:39 - just do it on my own uh basically if we
220:41 - sort before we set uh new data then uh
220:46 - react will react of course picks up on
220:48 - the change in data and
220:50 - since down here uh we're
220:57 - actually like we're actually rendering
220:59 - these sorry I got to scroll the way down
221:03 - um these
221:06 - events so we're rendering this this data
221:09 - in these events so if the order of this
221:12 - data if anything in data changes then it
221:15 - react's going to rerender these so um if
221:18 - we change the order based on location in
221:22 - state react picks up on the state change
221:24 - and then these will automatically
221:25 - reorder and that's exactly what we want
221:27 - to happen so basically that is the last
221:31 - step in this process is
221:35 - simply sorting by
221:40 - distance uh before we set this and then
221:43 - at that point when this gets set
221:45 - everything will rerender it will work so
221:51 - um so Patrick
221:56 - saying but you need an elone location
221:58 - map that sets the distance to event on
222:00 - others what I'm going to do I think is
222:04 - um either have the uh uh the person
222:08 - who's in charge of content go in and set
222:10 - the location for everything so I won't
222:12 - have to worry about not having a
222:14 - location in there or I'll just go in and
222:15 - do it myself and then I'm going to make
222:18 - that a required field so every new event
222:20 - added in it they have to put the
222:23 - location on it um I I don't think
222:28 - there's going to be anything like a
222:29 - online event or anything where there
222:31 - wouldn't be a location so I think I can
222:33 - get away with setting that as mandatory
222:35 - and then I won't have to worry about
222:39 - it and that'll save me the time from
222:42 - having to put that uh in the code anyway
223:04 - Brandon says should always check for no
223:06 - anyways can never depend on your users
223:08 - and a thumbs up for that yeah if I do
223:12 - although I was if I make it a required
223:14 - field then they won't actually even be
223:16 - able to make a new event unless they set
223:20 - the field so if there were to be um an
223:24 - error it would
223:26 - be either like the Google API uh stopped
223:30 - working like maybe I hit my limit on on
223:33 - that or something so actually um it
223:36 - there could
223:40 - be there could be an instance where
223:42 - maybe um something happened
223:45 - with the Google API messing up
223:48 - so uh so I will do that um let me add
223:53 - this
224:35 - all right
224:39 - so Patrick's saying add uh infinity what
224:44 - how do I add how do how do I make
224:45 - something Infinity this is another one
224:47 - of those questions that I'm just like I
224:49 - probably should know this
225:03 - uh I'm sure this is one of those
225:07 - um like questions in uh JavaScript
225:10 - Basics that I just don't know
225:13 - because cuz I always jumped around when
225:15 - learning things to just learn whatever I
225:17 - needed for the project that I was
225:19 - doing and uh I have gaps in my
225:25 - education math Infinity okay cool thank
225:29 - you that makes sense and I mean honestly
225:31 - I probably sorry I even asked that I
225:33 - definitely could have looked that up so
225:42 - um oh you don't even need math so you
225:45 - could uh
225:49 - so so I can just do Infinity
225:56 - then that's really
225:59 - cool all right so yeah actually that's
226:01 - legit check this out in uh the console
226:04 - so infinity is infinity
226:09 - awesome uh
226:11 - so sweet so that should work
226:23 - cool that's cool I learned so many new
226:26 - things new and useful things today uh so
226:30 - I am going
226:34 - to make sure
226:37 - I commit this and push it to the get
226:40 - repo cuz if I need to or want to work on
226:44 - this on vacation I'll definitely need it
226:46 - in the
226:47 - repo uh because I can't take my iMac
226:50 - with
226:53 - me all right
226:56 - so just want to make sure it's I I
226:59 - probably don't need to do this but I
227:00 - always type get status like almost
227:02 - always just to make sure that I didn't
227:04 - accidentally um edit any other files uh
227:08 - without realizing
227:10 - it so
227:18 - and try like what did it's been so long
227:21 - we've been working on this so I want to
227:23 - make sure I remember what we did our
227:25 - last commit
227:27 - was
227:30 - um what was
227:34 - that we didn't have a last commit did we
227:45 - okay get user location I thought we did
227:48 - so we have get user
227:52 - location uh so now it's going to be um
228:14 - all right that works that pretty much
228:17 - sums up what we
228:20 - did it's crazy that all that work summed
228:23 - up in such a short commit
228:26 - message but I still feel good that we
228:28 - did
228:29 - it and by we I mean mostly you and I did
228:32 - the
228:33 - typing whoa what
228:38 - errors figures it figures I thought I
228:41 - was done and now I have errors uh
228:43 - where's my error irregular white
228:47 - space seriously irregular white space
228:50 - well at least it tells me exactly where
228:52 - so JS
228:55 - 56
228:58 - so is it
229:04 - because it's because of this
229:09 - stuff what is this white where is my
229:12 - irregular white space
229:19 - I don't even know does anybody know what
229:21 - what the heck it's doing to me for
229:24 - regular irregular white
229:26 - space
229:28 - um all right let me see let me check the
229:32 - live chat
229:35 - um you all don't have to watch me uh
229:38 - figure out these errors because this is
229:40 - not like major errors everything works
229:43 - it's just
229:45 - I have some weird white space somewhere
229:46 - that I have to find
229:49 - um let me check really quick in the
229:52 - chat uh I'm probably not going to go
229:54 - through the whole chat this time to
229:56 - answer questions for two reasons one I'm
229:58 - just I'm really tired and I need to just
230:01 - be done also like this stream has been
230:04 - so long uh there probably aren't that
230:07 - many people that have been here since
230:08 - the beginning so they might not even be
230:10 - around to hear the answer so I am going
230:13 - to save this live chat and then read
230:15 - through it later on and um and try to
230:18 - answer that maybe in a
230:20 - future in a future live stream or put it
230:23 - in the comments for this video or
230:24 - something like
230:29 - that all right so Andre has a quick
230:32 - question which setting did you use in
230:35 - order to be able to use the spread
230:36 - operator on objects when I use it in
230:39 - Chrome Dev tools it does not work um
230:47 - let's
230:48 - see okay Patrick Patrick gave the answer
230:51 - that I was going to give uh yeah so all
230:54 - my all the Babel transpiling stuff that
230:56 - I'm doing right now is building an xjs I
230:59 - haven't uh I haven't done anything with
231:02 - that so I'm not sure exactly what they
231:04 - have going on it probably says in their
231:07 - documentation uh so I'm assuming that
231:09 - they
231:11 - are allowing you know they're they're
231:13 - transpiling pretty much you know The
231:15 - Cutting
231:17 - Edge uh since I I've never used
231:20 - anything that hasn't worked uh in terms
231:23 - of newer JavaScript stuff
231:26 - so whatever whatever um flavor of bble
231:30 - they're
231:31 - using uh is covers most most things at
231:36 - least everything I've
231:39 - tried
231:41 - um let's see
231:59 - oh okay I copy and pasted okay sha thank
232:03 - you so much
232:05 - um so I copy EV I copied and pasted this
232:10 - line
232:11 - [Music]
232:12 - from the chat
232:15 - which I need to just quit that because
232:18 - it keeps messing me up so maybe maybe
232:23 - that'll solve
232:26 - it let's
232:32 - see shoot it's happening again uh but
232:36 - actually I I didn't think about this
232:38 - before but it is telling me it's line
232:42 - what is it line 56
232:46 - 40 so where am
232:52 - I
232:54 - 40 whoa oh man that's weird do you guys
232:58 - see that so I can click here this is
233:00 - really weird so I I'm going to click
233:03 - three times and watch what happens I
233:05 - click three times one two three between
233:09 - that second and third click it doesn't
233:10 - move so that's definitely it
233:16 - and hopefully this isn't okay looks like
233:20 - that one works that is so
233:24 - weird I've I've never seen
233:29 - that there we go and that worked
233:39 - awesome sweet okay so all everything we
233:43 - just did is now up in the repo on GitHub
233:45 - under the geolocation Branch so uh you
233:48 - can check it out if you want
233:50 - to um all right
233:54 - so thank you to everyone this was
233:57 - insanely a long stream and uh thanks
234:00 - everybody who stuck around what was this
234:01 - like a 4our stream I can't believe that
234:04 - um so uh yeah I'm I'm not going to talk
234:08 - a lot at the end of this one uh thanks
234:10 - and I will see you all I'll be
234:15 - back a week not next week but the week
234:18 - after I should be back on Monday uh
234:22 - so uh yeah thanks thanks everybody I
234:25 - really appreciate um have a have a great
234:27 - day and have a have a great weekend and
234:30 - next week and um and I'll see you later
234:34 - and I'll be on Twitter and in the um IRC
234:38 - room and stuff like that so uh you got
234:40 - any questions or anything like that just
234:42 - you know message me on Twitter I'll be
234:44 - around

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody it's Jesse and we're going to do some geolocation stuff today so the BR there's a geolocation API for the browser where I'm sure you've seen this before a website will ask you know can we get your location or something like that and if you allow them to get your location then usually they use that to tell you either you know what's the weather near you or what events are near you or maybe give you get you directions to somewhere so in this case we want to get the location of the user and then compare it to the location of our events and then order our events from those that are closest to those that are farest away uh before I get started I just want to let you know that about 12 minutes ago the power went out here so if everything just gets cut off it's the power probably went out again so it's there are big thunderstorms happening right now so uh hopefully it won't happen again uh but if it does I'll try to get restarted and get back on as soon as I can I've never had a stream cut out in the middle so I'm not even sure if I can join the same stream again or not I'm thinking yes um cuz I I wouldn't have actually clicked the button to stop the stream it'll just say like I've lost connection so as long as I get the computer up and running and start OBS again to start streaming should be good to go uh so also I want to acknowledge the contributions that you all have made so a lot of people contribute in the live chat and are very helpful uh but then also I've had some people contribute directly uh to the repository for the site we've been working on so uh so V and uh Danny and uh Fabian or I thought about it the other day uh since you're from France it's probably not pronounced Fabian so Fabian I'm not sure let me know if you're watching um so anyway thanks so much for these uh contributions and feel free to contribute I started putting some issues in uh in the repo so I'm going to make try to remember to put the issues in here and maybe if if you've never contributed to a repository before some of these are going to be pretty easy some more in depth but you know maybe it'll get you some practice in how to contribute and uh you know certainly nobody feel obligated to contribute this is definitely the project is completely my responsibility but uh I know it's some sometimes it's intimidating to try to submit pool requests to projects so this might be a nice like small project uh to get just to get a feel for for how you do it and uh if you need any help let me know and I could try to walk you through it uh and if you submit a pool request and it's not exactly what I need no big deal I'll just let you know what needs changed and you make the changes and submit it again uh I'm I'm Lu going to be upset if you submit a bunch of pool requests uh I'm I'm happy for the assistance so anyway let's let's get started let me move this out of here because we won't need it right now so here's the steps I was just kind of thinking in the last few minutes before I start this video what we need to do we need to add let me know if this is too small I think this is the same font size we had yesterday I don't think I mess with it so if it was okay yesterday it should still be good um we need to add a map field to the nearby event custom post type so that's going to show up in WordPress so let me let me show you this here I actually already added it but I didn't add in an API key and I need to so that's why this isn't working right now so that step is partially finished once that's in place we'll we'll fill out some data in there so we have something coming in through the API and then we need to prompt the user for their location that's the part where we'll use the geolocation API which I had open somewhere but after I had to restart my computer uh from the the power outage all my windows are in different places so I'll try to find it it might actually be faster to just search for it again because I have so many windows open um after that we need to compare the user's location to the event location so this should be we're we'll have the latitude and longitude for both of these then we're going to show the events um we're going to put the closest events that are closest to the user first and then go from there to those are farthest away the last one I think is just wishful thinking and that's end the stream one time which rarely ever happens but I'm going to try uh so I was in a little bit earlier than normal this morning so I I really don't want to be here super late and I also work through my lunch break so I can definitely get out of here I could probably leave now and be fine but I want to do the stream so I'm gonna check the uh the live chat and just say hello to everybody before we get started hey everyone AAR says hello from Mars Hi Sam says I enjoy that these are becoming a more daily thing yeah it's it's intended to be a daily thing at least Monday through Friday uh but I had some there were sometimes when I was I couldn't stream because either I was sick or uh occasionally the stream time changes because I have meetings uh but basically yeah it's it should be pretty much every day if I can hey No No's back uh how's it going says uh second time on the streams uh and old ask does Jesse like to HTML CSS JS beginner kind of stuff um yes I do like to do that so if you're more like at the beginner level and you're looking at this like this is over my head we're at the end of a project so at the beginning of this project uh if you go back and watch some of the first recordings it'll be way more beginner level now we're to the end so you know we've already taken a lot of those little steps and now we have something a lot more complex so it's hard to jump in at this point although I'm still going to try to explain things as best I can so hopefully no matter what level you're at you'll still get something out of it um as soon as I'm done with this project I'll jump into another project and that'll be like starting all over again so I always try to do something new or something better or try a new tool or something so each project will be a little bit different but it's end up it's going to be like a cycle of you know going back to the basics of setting up a site and then building on that so if it's if it's a little bit over your head right now don't worry you know give it a week or so I'll be done with this site and then you know we'll be right back to some basic stuff I am also going to put some videos on my personal channel that are going to be more like really basic level tutorial videos and uh I have I have some outlines and some notes ready for those it's just a matter of finding a little bit of time where it's quiet enough uh at my house or some time at at work to just do those videos okay all right great Rohan says font size is good uh and also ask Google Maps API yeah so I'm going to be using the Google Maps API at the very least within WordPress here to pull up a Google map and basically what I want so you can see this right now the uh content editor comes in here fills out the title of the event the date and then the display date which uh if you if you're not sure why I have two different dates here uh check out yesterday's episode and I I explained why I needed uh the date in two different formats here um you know and they fill out this basic info but now in addition to the location and this is how it will actually display I also want them to put the location in here if they search and type in the location here then it it should on the API end it'll come out with with some data uh probably multiple Fields but one of those fields will contain the latitude and longitude and that's what I need so that's that's where I'm going to use the Google Maps API here and then we'll see for this step compare the user location to event location I may need to use some sort of API so I don't I don't really know what the best API is I I did a little bit of research beforehand so if you all have experience with this let me know what you think I'm also thinking a really kind of fast way to do this potentially could be to just do some comparisons with just the raw latitude and longitude uh potentially it might be possible to just do some basic math comparing the latitude longitude of the event to the user location and then be able to give a rough kind of estimate of distance uh from the user so this you know these aren't going to be pinpoint locations they're just going to be the general location of a city so it doesn't need to be like super exact so if you have any ideas for that as well let me know we you know we we'll get into that more when we get to this step though and then see what the best way uh to do this would be if you're just joining for the first time I will say these aren't tutorials this is me just doing my daily work so that's why I'm saying things like I don't really know what we're going to do let's try it uh because that's that's my work I know I want to do this this part of the website is arguably going to be the most useful part of the site to our users and I think this feature in particular will be the most useful feature of this part of the site this nearby events part so um so I know I want it I know how I want it to work and I just need to figure out how to make it work with with all of you helping all right let's see just had a bunch of stuff in the live chat so I just want to check it out very quickly and this will give you uh a few minutes too to um think about these these steps and these questions um philli says I'm a selftaught coach and I just recently stumbled on your site best selflearning resource ever wow that's I'm glad you think that awesome uh and thanks thanks for saying that uh I love uh comments like that it uh keeps me going and keeps me thinking that this is a worthwhile thing to do so I really appreciate that um WIS M23 says hi I am new here hey welcome uh welcome to the channel ask any questions if if you're confused about what's going on the people in the live chat are super helpful and knowledgeable and I also try to get to all the questions as well sometimes I don't get to them till the end of the stream uh if you can't stick around to the end end of the stream just direct message me on Twitter or something and and I can answer your question uh later on so but uh welcome um SM says how would you recommend learning react the free code Camp course doesn't have much on it yet yeah that's true it doesn't have much on it yet um I would say like tutorial videos are nice the react documentation itself like the basic react website has a pretty good kind of walkth through for react and I think I think code academy um has a react course now for free I like vaguely remember taking that course a while back when it first came out so that's those are my that's my best advice and check out some of the earlier videos when we just started this project it'll maybe get you a good idea of how to like get started and then you can mess around with it and that's kind of the best way really is you know use something to jump start a project and then so you can actually start changing things and see what happens so uh and I'm I'm sure some of you all that are watching probably have some great resources too so uh you know please put that in the live chat as well or in the comments this video um kak ask this is react native right no it's just regular react uh not react native yet I'd love to do something with react native uh at some point if I can I don't have any projects coming up at my job that will need react native anytime soon so it might have to be a side project uh yeah coac says uh so what's the scope of this project R react on WordPress yeah basically WordPress is the content management and it exists on a separate server and then we use the WordPress API to pull in all the content into a react site that has server side rendering and it runs on a totally different server uh running node and uh and react uh we actually engine X running as well yeah Rohan uh is is asking we doing browser location or IP based we're going to do the browser location Sam says uh Google Maps has a shortest path map so yeah maybe that might be the best thing best thing to do all right I think that's it for I really at the beginning I I want to see if there's anybody new that has any questions to kind of get them in I don't want them to to leave and you know think they're being ignored and leave so um so I'm going to get check out so kak asks why use a separate react site for pulling content from WordPress if you can stick around to the towards the end I will answer that in in depth uh for now I'm sure a few of the people in the live chat that have heard me say this a couple of times can um can fill you in so if somebody wants to take that on and and fill him in really quick I'll get started um but I'll definitely answer you at the end give a more full explanation uh and then if if you get a chance to watch some of the past videos I do explain it kind of as I'm going uh what I'm doing uh but um let's let's get started so first things first let's get this thing working so we need to get an API key for Google Google Maps so let me look up I like I said the power went out and now my windows are in the wrong places so I had a lot of this documentation ready and now I don't know where it is Maybe maybe I did just close it out but so let's try this um let's see ACF map field there we go all right so I'm just going to I'm using the plugin Advanced custom fields and that just helps me make these custom Fields a lot faster than I would be able to if I was doing it in like a custom plugin with PHP just because I'm not great with PHP so if you're not awesome at PHP I recommend using something like this so let's see here we go so API key all right it looks like I will have to edit some PHP so oh well I guess so I guess I can't get around it here so unexpectedly we'll be doing a little PHP today little WordPress PHP uh this doesn't look too difficult I'm saying put this in the functions.php file I kind of don't want to put it in functions.php we do already have our custom plugin I'd hate to throw it in with that but it somewhat fits in there because that plugin is creating custom post types and this is just enabling a field for one of those custom post types that we're already creating so it may make sense to put that in there I just always hate to edit functions.php directly um especially since we're not really using any of the functions for the themes right now uh since we're just using the API so yeah we'll try to put this in our plugin uh that we we edited I don't maybe sometime last week we were editing that so anyway let's get the API key first and get a key I I kind of think that I already have gotten the key before new project uh CI create inable API all right awesome all right so yeah definitely you can all see this API key right now so uh don't go crazy with it um and this is probably a great idea to restrict its usage so let's do that as well since I'm putting it on YouTube and we want it to only come from uh let me think this will probably be coming from the WordPress install so so will be get start and I'm not exactly sure where the rest of that will be so I'm going to save that hopefully I did that right and it will work if we try to use this API key and it doesn't work then might maybe I'll come back here and take out that restriction because it's possible I mess that up and that will mess up us trying to use the uh the API so now let's go back and see we need to put this in here uh I have let's throw that API key in right here so I don't lose it in case I accidentally copy something else and let me grab so I still if if you remember the last time we were editing this plugin this PHP plugin I um I never I didn't get uh FTP working so it was supposed to be set up so that I could use SSH or FTP to get into that server uh I didn't set up the server but um I'm not sure exactly what happened but I couldn't get in so I ended up just just doing this which oops I'm going to have to make this bigger um so I'll end up going to the plugins and where's mine at going to edit and just copy and pasting this which I know this is this like makes me sad to do this but at this point especially since we're streaming this will be way faster than trying to figure out why I can't get into the server uh a more sensible way so I'm just going to put this over here and I'm going to grab this and put this let's see I want to make sure I put it it looks like I can just put it at the very bottom but still inside this PHP yeah so this function I just want to make sure I'm not putting it inside of another function and messing things up um okay this should work also another reason why this makes me really sad to do it like this is this is a live site right now and if I mess this up the site will go down temporarily there is some caching involved so there's a decent chance that if it's only down for a few seconds no one will notice where' I put that API key oh right here all right and after I do this and see if it works I'm going to check check back in with the uh live chat as well so if you're feeling ignored you won't be ignored for long uh that looks like the only thing I had to I had to change so I'm going to as much as much as it hurts me to do this I'm going to copy and paste back in all right so we have this down here let's update the file I'm a little apprehensive because if you've ever worked with WordPress and if you know if you make an error in one of these occasionally what will happen is you'll get this white screen with some text on it I think it's a white screen or grayish maybe and you're locked out and the only way to get back in is you actually have to get to the files so since I can't do that I really hope that um the person who set up the server is still here at work so that I can run in real quick and have him do it so let's give it a shot just I I am saying like you should probably never do it like this this is not the right way to do it all right awesome so it worked it worked also keep your WordPress up to date I don't have it up I'm like one version behind right now and uh I don't want to update until I back up my uh my database so I didn't have time to do that yet so I'm going to back up the database and then I'm to update it might be cool for me to back up the database like on a video just to show you how to manually back it up I won't do it live probably but maybe if I do that like at some point soon maybe I'll record it I don't know let me know if you're interested in anything like that okay so we need to go back to events and in this one let's go back in here and see yes all right so that's definitely better than the big error page and let's see where is this at Marietta hey that's not that far from where I'm at Marietta Ohio awesome okay so maretta Ohio and let's update that I'm actually really interested to see what comes out in the API from this because I haven't seen it yet so I'm going to bring in this I was actually I was trying to get something to work and uh I'm just briefly I'm just going to tell you in case you have any ideas because I couldn't get it to work so I have this plugin called mult it's multiple post types for the WordPress API so you're supposed to be able to just let me see if I can zoom this in there we go so you're supposed to be able to just type in multiple post type and then you can access different post types like this which it does it works like this so I can actually get all my pages and all my posts just like this but if I want to use some parameters here to maybe filter this I can't get it to work basically it'll filter everything the same way I can't get it to filter just one so like let's say if I want one particular page and I search for it by the slug for that page I won't get any posts because it'll actually be searching for posts with that same Slug and it didn't matter where I put that filter uh in here or what order I did it I still got the same result so I'm wondering if this plugin in fact just can't do that maybe it wasn't designed to do that if that's the case then I'm in a bit of trouble because I was relying on this uh to be able to load multiple different post Types on one page which I'm going to need to do so let me know if you have any ideas with that another alternative that that I didn't want to do cuz it would result in multiple API calls but if it's the only way to do it uh then I'm fine with it would be to figure out here in basically in get initial props I'd like to be able to make multiple API calls in here so I if you I've tried to make multiple API calls in here it's only ever resulted an error for me but I there's got to be some way to do it right I mean if we can make one API call then we can make two right and I'm just missing uh somehow how how to do this so so think about that if you have a minute and if you have any thoughts let me know I'm going to give it a shot obviously and try to work through it but um if you all have any input that may help me to work through it a lot faster and I would appreciate that all right so let's go back here to what we were going to do and I want to see what kind of data I'm getting here so what was this nearby nearby event and I've already searched that at some point so there we go that's the one I wanted so let's go down here to if you've never seen this before this is uh this is Json so this is what Json formatted data looks like and this in par normally you'll see this actually but I have a uh Chrome plugin that makes it look like this much easier to read uh but the WordPress API formats everything like this and what I want to do normally I I edit I don't get all this extra stuff that I don't need but I'm looking okay so the field that I want would be location uncore map and really what I'm most interested in is this latitude and longitude awesome so we have that there we know how to get it so let's go back to our steps to see where we're at so uh add map field good that's done so we we completed this first one and so let me all right that'll be completed trying to think I was trying to think of like what could I what symbol could I use that would indicate completed and I couldn't really find anything uh so I know there's some way to do like a check mark or something but it's not really a check mark but I think it's like a math symbol but anyway uh uh now let's let's go to this this part so since I I kind of lost the documentation that I was trying to use let's look it up again and geolocation API let me make this bigger so you all can see and yep that's what I was looking for so using geolocation oh and I said I was going to check the live chat and I forgot so let me check it again got a lot of activity going on here I'm going to scroll through real quick okay so I'm I'm right now I'm just kind of scrolling through for any questions that are really relevant right now so if I skip your comment I I've seen it and I'm going to come back to it towards the end of the stream so I'm not uh I'm seeing them and I I do definitely intend to get to them um okay Rohan says this is uh pretty relevant uh changing the API key and using an environment variable to store it after the video might be a good idea so yeah actually maybe I I should change the API key I don't think I'll need to use an environment variable because it's not actually going to go in any of the code if you remember we um well we put it in the WordPress plugin that is not actually in the the GitHub repo or anything like that that plugin only exists um on that WordPress server and and is is not really uh publicly accessible as far as I know so let me know if I'm wrong about that but it it should be just enough to change the API key uh if I'm not mistaken but that I mean that's that's good advice I don't know maybe somebody try to use that same API key I'll put it up on the screen somebody try to use my API key uh and see if it works for you I don't mean to order anybody around just if you feel like it please try to use my API key uh I feel like I'm being a little bit bossy today I don't know I got very little sleep last night my kids were awake several of my children were awake multiple times last night and then I had meetings all morning so it's just kind of feeling a little a little little weird tired okay Amelia says uh I was kind of lost but I'm seeing that nearby is already a plugin for WordPress right uh amelo yeah I made this uh plugin so here you can see the plugin it's hard to tell because it's I haven't saved it as a PHP file locally so it's it doesn't have the syntax highlighting but basically you you can kind of see here like I'm registering a post type this is the resource post type so I'm I'm registering this post type here and giving it all the how I want the names to display saying I wanted to show up in the rest API uh and then I'm doing that for a bunch of them so all these different post types and then somewhere at the bottom here I actually yeah I create create new type so uh so yeah so I just made this plugin just to add all these post types and down here I have just some of the code for custom taxonomies it's all commented out right now cuz I don't have any taxonomies yet I may not need them so hopefully that clears things up for you whoa Rohan says you can force syntax highlighting by changing it at the bottom right corner let me check out the bottom right corner I actually never mess with any of this stuff in the bottom right corner what Rohan you you are U my favorite person of the day unless somebody else unless somebody else comes up with something amazing Rohan definitely wins uh favorite person award for today that is awesome you don't know how many times I've um I've had a file I didn't really want to save it locally I just needed to edit it really quick and and I have actually saved it with a file extension at the end just to get the syntax highlighting and so my my file structure on my computer is filled with just these files that I'll never use again and usually multiple versions of these files so that's awesome if that's like really obvious uh I mean then then I'm a Noob and I'm fine with that uh I'm really excited about that all right awesome so does that mean I could do it with this too and make this Mark down if I wanted to and could I then use sorry uh markdown preview will this work oh no did it open a third pane oh awesome so that does work that's so cool this also is a problem too off like I just I don't want to actually save this file I don't need to but I did want it to actually show up and be able to use markdown and now I can although I I definitely don't want it to be in this third pain here I want this to go away and I don't need this anymore so I want this to go away well let me just move it over because if I am going to change that API key sometime soon I'll just leave this should I leave it no I don't really need it it won't be hard for me to just put the API key directly into the WordPress editor even though it's like there's no syntax highlighting it's kind of hard to deal with but all right great let me get back to that's so cool um let's let's get back to the project uh Sam says too bad you guys aren't using them yeah we've talked about Vim before on this stream and uh basically my opinion on Vim is I'm super jealous of everyone that knows how to use him and when I see somebody use it it's like I don't know it's like a when when you're a little kid and you see like the older kids and they look really cool that's like my view on people that use them so uh it just looks really cool when they're using it and uh I want to be like that one day when I grow up I want to use them all right so let's get to geolocation apis publisher Navigator geolocation object I'm I'm sure this is just like riveting to watch me go through documentation so sorry about that but I do want this to be an accurate representation of my daily work and a lot of my daily work is spent going through documentation oh okay let's just grab this really quick and see what we can do with it um actually let me just throw this in here because I want to change this to a console log and yeah that looks good let's log that and let's throw this in here um where we at honestly I I guess I can just inspect any site it doesn't really matter I just want the um the JavaScript console open this should work I'm just gonna throw this in the console yep allow yeah why not you can know where I am what let's try it again there we go yeah I had to oh it just took a minute okay cool so there we go now you all know where uh my location is which was it's not really a secret so evidently this is I mean obviously this is probably not my exact location because it's going through like my my ISP so I'm not really even sure where that would be uh but that's what we want so here's the thing I don't think I want a user to be prompted with this right away and uh I'll show you why if you've seen the site that page on the site before you probably already know why uh it's pretty obvious but for everyone that's new or hasn't hasn't seen this page before um I guess I don't even have this page open anymore uh you know what I wonder if my uh my Dev server was um shut off whenever the power went out so it should be I restarted it so it should be working now and if you want to check it out it's at katak x.com um if you can't spell that which I have to think to spell that and I've typed it a million times there's a link in the description all right so we're going to the events page so it actually be cats.com events okay so here's the events page right so if I were to just automatically ask for the users's location they'd get here and it would pop up and ask them and they would think assuming that this is the first time they've been to this page they'll think why do you need to know where I'm at right that's what I would think hey Quincy uh so uh Quincy Larson just joined the live chat if you don't know who that is that's the founder of free code Camp so um that's this is really cool that he's in the live chat uh thanks thanks for joining the live chat and um I'm geeking out a little bit that you're in the live chat because I remember watching Quincy do a live chat oh I don't know like two years ago or something I can't remember but kind of early on in free code Camp he was doing like a live um a live stream and I actually remember I was like on my exercise bike working out and um so uh I remember exactly what I was doing when I was watching that I don't know it might have been one of the New Year's streams something like that oh cool so I apologize for all the the geeking out I'm doing right here but I am going to read this because it's awesome Quincy says Hey Jesse longtime fan of your work I've never gotten to watch you live before I really really appreciate that I I mean I like I really look up to your work Quincy and everything you've done with free code camp and it's definitely helped me in my career I mean not just just my career but my family and being able to provide for them so uh so I'm going to stop now and get back to my stream but I just want to let you know I really really appreciate it and I appreciate the opportunity to stream for free code Camp uh it's really been amazing for me and uh we kind of got a nice Community built around here so I think it's helping people um so thank you for that opportunity all right so to get back to what we were talking about and I know it looks like there's a lot of activity going on the live chat so I will get to that in a minute but I definitely do want to get this a little bit more done before I really kind of dig into the questions in the live chat so like I said you go to this page right if the user gets prompted here at this page for their location say you know allow allow us to know your location they're going to have no idea why we want to know their location because the link only it's just said events okay so they're going to have to scroll all the way down to here before they might have any idea of why we would want their location so I don't want it to just go off right off the bat so I'm thinking there's there's maybe two options actually three here's the three options I'm thinking about and you all let me know what you think uh is the best so first idea is I just have it set so that when you scroll to this point then uh this fires what so this basically fires obviously I'm not going to console log but uh this is going to fire and give us the latitude and longitude which is what we need so that also I think might be a little bit jarring uh to the user because potentially you know maybe they they're going to see that before they see this so I'm not that's probably the lowest on my list second option would be when they click location for for sorting and I am going to probably put some sort of Icon next to each uh header that's that's sortable when they click here then it would pop up and ask I'm hesitant to do it like that though because I would like users to be able to click here and sort this alphabetically the third option is I put a button somewhere around here that says something like show nearest Events first or something uh I know uh Andrew uh who's in the live chat I don't think I saw Andrew in here yet today maybe he couldn't join us today but Andrew sent a link to some nice um basically form design let me let me share this with you if you weren't in yesterday I didn't get a chance to see this uh I know the link Link at first the link as it was pasted in the chat didn't work so maybe you didn't get a chance to see this but uh this was kind of cool just showed a lot of different way to do tables but what I noticed in here that I wanted to kind of look at more and maybe try to implement was the way they did it's down towards the bottom okay so here so they have this where maybe I could do something like this at the top of the events table here oops and you know something like that up here probably underneath this this um H H tag but right about there maybe I could do something there that would work and it would look nice I kind of I like how that works I still want to keep with a material design feel since that's what we're going for with this site so uh you know right off the bat I mean the button can be anything it doesn't have to look good but then at some point you know we're going to we're going to have to style it so I'll leave off The Styling for later uh maybe maybe I'll do that you know when I'm not streaming uh depending on how long this takes but I do want to have a button I think so that the user's not like abruptly faced with this decision to allow me to do something uh in this case know where they're at uh so let me know what you think about that or if you have any thoughts on in terms of the UI where I should put that for now just to get this working I don't think there's any problem with me just saying this is going to pop up immediately right just for testing that's fine and uh while while I was showing you that my um command line my terminal was visible which it was covered up before and I just noticed that I am on the master branch and I don't want to make changes on the master Branch for this because this is uh pretty pretty big feature you know this is not a huge site so this feature is is pretty big uh in terms of the scope of the site so I definitely want to do it on another Branch if you're not familiar with with using the terminal or using G get let you make these like alternate versions of the project I like to think of it as like parallel universes so if you've ever seen any movies or had comic books or something that has that concept it's like there are these little parallel universes called get branches where it's your project but it's it's different and you can do whatever you want in there and then if you mess it up or you need to go back you can just switch back to your master Branch so that's what I'm going to do now I'm just going to create a branch and I'll I'll show you so I'm going to type in get get branch uh let me make this a bit bigger in case you can't see especially I'm thinking maybe if someone's on a phone it might be pretty hard to see this so just a little bigger hopefully that's enough uh so I already have all these branches and you see most of them are basically they correspond to some kind of major feature uh that I wanted to put in that I knew would would take me a while and I'd have to go back to masonry and make some or master and make some little changes along the way so let's call this one uh let's call it geolocation so we're going to go get Branch Geo geolocation right I was just double checking to make sure I spelled that right and now when I sayp get Branch uh I did that I I know probably a lot of you know this in this is basic but in case somebody's not familiar with the command line to get to do this basically where I'm going through this really quickly um I just type I I hit the up uh key the up Arrow key on my keyboard and I can go back through like my history of commands so very useful so now I have get branch and check it out geolocation is there now if I want to navigate to that parallel universe that version of my uh my site I just go get checkout and there there are shortcuts for all of these commands I usually just use the long ones because I haven't really bothered to memorize the shortcuts but uh just know you usually don't have to type this much to your commands uh goo and also a good tip I can just type in Geo and then hit Tab and it'll autocomplete because there's nothing else that starts with Gio I probably I could have just typed G and it would autocomplete so that can also save you a lot of time when you're typing on the command line and there we go now I'm on the branch geolocation I could do whatever I want on this branch and it's not going to affect any of these other branches but when I'm ready and this feature is is ready to go and I want it to go live I can merge it into the master branch and now that feature will be in master and it'll it'll get along nicely with everything else I've done in master and and I can push it live uh and everything will work so that's kind of the beauty of get uh among other things that's what's really cool about it okay so I didn't really intend to do uh like a get or terminal tutorial but seemed like a good time to talk about it so now that I'm on uh a separate Branch now I feel confident that I can start changing things up and I can start changing things with Reckless abandon confident that my project is safe so let's grab this piece of code I don't need this anymore and we want to be on the events page so let's go to events.jpg here and we I we'll just console log this for now just so we make sure it's working uh and then in let's try putting a component did Mount the only thing I'm worried about is I don't think this will fire on the server side I should I should remember this by now because I've dealt with this for months now uh let me know what you think I'll check the live chat in a minute uh after the you guys hear this from the delay um I'm worried because I'm not sure that Navigator is actually available on the server so it may throw an error but let's just let's see if it does get location and I'm going to save that and we will find out I guess quickly oops get location is what do you mean it's not defined maybe it's just what's up with this there we go no did I spell it wrong all right I'm going to check the live chat because it should have been the delay should have been over by now also I want to check in as I haven't really looked at it for a few minutes so I'm just going to scroll up a bit just to um see if if anybody's confused or if you have some really good advice for me or anything oh Sam says practical Vim is a book that changes lives all right thanks for that practical Vim I'll have to remember that one I am serious I would like to learn Vi at some point I don't know if it'll happen in the near future but i' I'd love to do it okay good so Sebastian tested the API key for Google Google Maps and it said refer not allowed map error awesome so it seems like my API key is safe for the time being uh I'm guessing though as always there's probably some way to like spoof the URL and get it anyway so somebody who wasn't very nice and sees my API key probably could do that so I should probably change it anyway uh but probably not a huge deal right now but I'll get it changed here within the next day or so oh okay I just saw um when Quincy first came in he said he uh noticed the stream was going on and tweeted about it awesome thank you um all right I'm almost through down to uh the bottom here with the live uh chat there's there is some discussion in the live chat about the beta curriculum for free code Camp so if you don't haven't heard about that check that out there's um even if you've been through the old curriculum there's a new one that's uh that's coming out I don't know when but if you'd like to help out with it uh check it out do some go through it do testing and contribute and um I know like everybody's uh is waiting and anticipating that new curriculum so uh it would be awesome if you could help out with that last night I actually uh started I started back in to pick up where I left off a long time ago with free code camps um with their lessons because I got really busy and just stopped progressing uh so I picked back up and I made which one did I do the weather I think I started redoing the weather one I had I had gotten it pretty much to where it worked before and then I got really like worried I wanted to make it really good instead of just getting it done so I just scrap that whole one and I'm going to redo it okay philli says nearby events button near the top of the event list yeah I think that's what it's going to happen that's what I'm going to go with oh cool Quincy said uh I'm honored to have played a part in your own coding Journey Bo and I are thrilled that you've been streaming so much a awesome I'm I'm glad I I wondered if uh if you all were happy that I was streaming so much or not so I didn't want to take advantage of the opportunity to stream on the channel so uh but I'm I'm glad if you're all right with that I'm going to keep keep streaming you know I think streaming Monday through Friday is I I I'm going to keep it up as for as long as it's helpful and as long as my boss lets me do it uh so oh and I mentioned Bo if you don't know Bo does all the like JavaScript tutorial videos on free code camps YouTube channel and they're awesome so check them out uh if you can if you get a chance okay Rohan says the Sorting menu and by location um should trigger permission request and probably have subtext of location permission required okay I haven't thought of that but that might be a good idea I guess I can't show you the page right now because I'm getting this error which I just left it at the error for now um partly because I figured if it was some silly mistake that I made somebody would would just see it and let me know you all usually catch my mistakes before I do get I feel like I'm in a mood today to make silly mistakes just because of uh of lack of sleep so I'm getting down towards the bottom we'll see maybe somebody somebody caught it oh we got some talk about web assembly uh I'm not going to go through that right now in the live chat but I'm super interested in web assembly I haven't had time to check it out too much okay so Rohan did confirm Navigator is not available in the uh in node environment so that's what we thought uh you have to use a client side okay Quincy said the curriculum the beta curriculum that I was just mentioning a few minutes ago will come out uh ASAP so as soon as possible um oh and Quincy's going to try to stream uh working through it once more of it is stable that's awesome and it says we're also building a jsbin like interface so you can build projects there that's really cool uh Bob asks it's actually Bob 2010 asks kind of random question but how does free code can't make money there's lots of ongoing development reliable servers at set with very little ads is it a charity I'm assuming that Quincy answered this so let me read down and he did Quincy said we are a donor supported nonprofit you can donate here uh freecodecamp.com donate so I encourage you to do that uh if you can not everybody's in a position to donate which I totally understand i' I've been there uh but if you're at a point in your career in your life where you have a little bit to spare uh please you know spare some for free code camp and uh I like I I definitely don't get paid for any of this so it's going to be going to help run you know keep up those servers and things like that it's not going you know in any anyone's pocket um oh Amelia said you are truly an inspiration with this streams man I really appreciate that thank you uh thank you for saying that oh okay here's a good tip so Q I know I've I've seen your name before and I know you told me how to pronounce it and I can't remember so it's q n o x I'm not even going to try it this time because I know I'm going to mess it up I'm really sorry that I forgot how to pronounce it uh but good tip um if you do controlr it's a good way to search past types commands as well and it's useful for Less typing that's really cool I did not know that you all are always giving me really awesome tips so control R oh nice really cool I don't know if you could see that but it turned into into this awesome really cool I'm assuming controller will get me out of it hopefully no let's see what will get me out of this q no uh control c yeah control C when in doubt control C and that will get you out all right Rohan ask to zoom into the air oh yeah sorry I I'm really sorry everybody I um I showed you this really tiny error message and I'm sure no one could actually see it so uh really sorry about that so looks like page of events well there's no way I have that many lines in that file so I'll leave this up for a couple more seconds and then I'm going to check the uh the file as well and I've gotten to the bottom of the live chat so it's back back to this now oh Jennifer says live streaming is terrific keep it up please awesome I'm I'm glad that uh that you you like it I intend to keep it up for as long as it is useful to you all I will definitely keep this up there we go uh Nico says what is the editor uh I'd love to go back at some point and see like what our streak is of um how many times uh people want to know about the editor which ni I'm not I'm not making fun of that question or anything because it's probably one of the first times you watched I have no problem with people asking all the time about the editor um but uh I find everybody's really interested in it uh so I was the same way when I watch videos of people doing stuff I always wonder what their tools are so um Don't Mind questions about it but it is Adam so uh it was answered in the live chat um but in case you're watching later on can't see the live chat the editor is Adam I have a link uh so you can learn more about it in the description all right so this has probably been up long enough for you all to check it out I'm going to move this over and see what's going on now I I don't really expect that to be much use because obviously that's telling me that I have an error on line 1,67 obviously I don't have a line 1067 so here's the problem I think it's needs to be this git location and I may have to use an arrow function here so let's do this yep there it was awesome that works so it's crazy that that having to use this happens like nearly every time I stream I have some error because I forgot to use this and I still don't remember it right off the bat but at least this time I remembered uh without without having to wait for somebody in the live chat to tell me so I think I'm getting better oh uh okay so C Kno so the I couldn't remember how to pronounce it qox okay I remember you saying like for I remember you saying that now but I don't mind you say it however you want no I want to say it the right way so I'll I'll try to remember it'll be easier to remember now that this is twice that I asked so uh third time's a charm hopefully I'll remember remember next time but uh this is interesting Quincy says we hope to bring back the live stream Summits as soon as we ship beta uh we're all in heads down mode right now trying to uh QA it and ship it so that's that's really awesome news there's going to be some really exciting stuff happening with free code Camp uh soon Alexander says put the editor in the title also and people less people will ask now I I really don't mind when people ask because then often the next thing that happens is there's a discussion in the live chat about which editor do you want to use which I think is cool because people get to learn more about other people's editors Cu uh sometimes people just use the editor that they're comfortable with and not really make the switch that's that's usually what I do is it's just so much easier to stay still right then than to move and try to get you know use something new but if I see everybody talking about it in the live chat I'm way more likely to have motivation to try it okay so check that out so that worked actually I want to let me clear this out because we did there was an error at first okay we didn't get the error again all right so um I thought maybe that had been left over from previously so I just wanted to verify that um and since I had already given permission here it didn't ask me for permission again you see the console log automatically came up here uh for my latitude longitude okay so we're good next step and how long is this been going on okay so we're already at an hour and 10 minutes for this stream so uh the last step here so this this step is this step is done for it's not going to happen uh but we got step one and step two are done now let's do the comparison so here's the thing I know I asked this at the beginning of the Stream So if you weren't around at the beginning I'll repeat it I I have this idea and I'm not sure if this will work that instead of making some call out to another API to have them compare locations what if I can just do some sort of math to compare these numbers and figure out which set of numbers has the least difference between them so basically it would be something like like okay so we have latitude and longitude I guess that's the order I can't remember what order I I wanted to get them in I guess that's important to know so let me double check that since we're going to be doing some math on it uh okay latitude first and then longitude so like for instance we can take my latitude minus the latitude of the event and get that and then do the same thing here and get whatever that is and then add these two numbers together and then we can use that number to order everything does that even make sense to me it makes some sense I will have to make sure we have some negative stuff going on here so I'll have to just be careful and watch out that I'm not uh maybe I I was thinking I could take the absolute value of this but that's I I don't think that's a legit solution because we need the absolute value right because that's that would or we need the negative in there to show like um it would make a big difference so we need that in there uh so anyway that's my idea and it would save us a lot of extra API calls because remember you know we have a lot of events down here and we need to actually compare whoa let me make that smaller you know we need to compare to each one of these events that's showing up here so right now it's not a huge list but it's going to get bigger so if this works this will definitely be preferable because doing some simple math is a lot faster than making you know 100 API calls also I don't know if if there is an API if it will let me make that many calls all the time so I'm going to check the live chat and see what what your opinion is uh Q Knox he had me in the in the live chat or actually he or she I'm not really sure so sorry sorry for assuming there but qo says um you forgot to use this so somebody did in the live chat catch me on that so so um ran says he says I'm getting faster so yeah I'm getting faster with that uh oh okay Patrick is linking to a stack Overflow uh page so I'm assuming that this is in response to to how to do the math on on these why do I have this open twice anyway I guess I can get rid of at least one of those says Patrick also says it may be overkill for this but you need uh great circle distances okay uh M Madu I I think that's how you pronounce it sorry if it's wrong says like your scroll at the bottom what did you use um just kind of really quickly you mean this scroll like this horizontal scroll uh this is just this is act this part is all CSS if you check out the materialize I think it's materialized css.com it's a fra JavaScript framework or I'm sorry like a CSS framework there's JavaScript included too it's um comparable to bootstrap if you're familiar with that and they have this responsive table class so I modified it slightly so that it would uh I had some formatting issues so I had to modify that and then I wanted it to work on all screen sizes but it's basically pretty much exactly how how it was for there so that's how I did that and then these just take um check out the GitHub repo I have a function called H scroller I think so check out that function in the app.js file and if you have questions about it let me know you can message me on Twitter and I can explain it but if you check that out it's really simple I'm just um incrementing the scroll position the horizontal scroll position and then decrementing it uh or decrement how do you say that decrement or decrement anyway hey Andrew is here how's it going Andrew glad you can make it all right we have some other ideas here about how to do this math oh Patrick said I actually bombed an interview on this exact question that you are implementing all right well now's the time to make up for let's get it done uh Rohan says we could probably calculate the uh Delta SL difference between difference and sort by sort by that between oh between locations okay all right so let's just try some let's try some of this math out so we can just take these values here I guess first of all let me where we at I need to find my WordPress because I'd like to have more than one uh example here so let me just throw in a map location for let's do three so two more events and then that'll give us uh a couple of couple of pieces of data with latitude and longitude to work with so where is this at St Moville that's where I'm at okay so that this actually this might be a nice case to see to see if anything weird happens in our math if the latitude and longitude match up I doubt they'll match up exactly but um cool all right so there's a second one and let's see I want this one to be in a different place so all right Austin Texas that's definitely a different place that works oh um I meant to mention this at some point in the Stream So I guess I'll just mention it now while I'm updating this uh I just started I don't know if you're all familiar with the free code camp like groups I can't remember what they they call them officially but basically all around the world there are people that get together and uh they code together and they help each other uh learn how to code so you can start them if there you can find out about them uh check out the free code Camp uh website there's a page on there where you can look up they use geolocation to look up a group near you uh and if there's not a group near you you can make one so that was my case there is no Stevenville free code camp at least there wasn't until last night and I created one so I don't think anybody watching here is anywhere close to Stubenville Ohio uh that's that's near Pittsburgh so you might be more familiar with where Pittsburgh is uh but if you are in the area or ever happen to be close to here let me know and then maybe you could come to one of our meetups uh they're actually they're building a new coffee shop really close to where I work so when that opens that that's probably where we're going to meet and uh it's supposed to be have really nice coffee and great Bagels so uh any of you are welcome to attend uh if you're ever in the area all right I don't need this anymore just going to clean this up I don't need yeah I don't need this and I probably don't need that so let's just move this over here and let's refresh this so that we can make sure and just verify that we have the data okay that's first one we had it already we have it here and we have data here great all right so we have three events to test this out on and I think we can test the theory without even writing any code uh because basically I we can just do this math not by hand I'm obviously going to use a calculator uh but I don't even need that I could probably just round this out it doesn't need to be exact but just as a proof of concept before we actually start to code this because if it doesn't work when we try to do this math there's no sense in and wasting time trying to code it uh if logically it's just not going to work uh so let me actually this is this sounds like a job for Google Sheets so let me bring over a Google sheet uh spreadsheet would be helpful here all right so I'm going to bring over Google sheet and I'm just going to throw some of this data in here very quickly all right so actually let me go L and long is that how you abbreviate longitude no LG they're abbreviating it okay um I remember in school when we learned about latitude and longitude I always thought about to remember which one's which I always thought like lat is fat and like the Earth looked like it was kind of fat around the middle and so I remembered that Latitude was like around around the equator and might be a silly way to remember it but it worked for me when I was in uh when I was in grade school all right so there's one location and let me quickly grab the other two and once they're in there then we can just make a formula and that way we don't have to do the math separately for every single one of these and since I know I I know which ones are closer so basically it should result the result should be that Stubenville obviously is the closest because that's where I'm at and then the next one would be Marietta Ohio and then the farthest one away is Austin Texas so we know what we it should be and let me grab let me grab mine and I'll just throw that in here for now all right actually I kind of want these to go shoot that's not what I want anyway I just throw in another row I wanted a little bit more space between here so basically we're going to take um uh right here yeah we'll just put it right here so I'm going to go equals oh this is really small I'm sorry everyone I should have made this a lot bigger so you could see it okay I'm going to glance quickly at the live chat just to see if I'm missing something something like really obvious that somebody's trying to tell me okay nothing there so here's what we're going to do we're going to take I guess it doesn't it might not really matter which one I take first uh let's go with we'll take E4 oops and we want E4 minus a and then we want to add that to the longitude which would be F4 minus there we go and we want these to be constants so I don't know how you do this in Google this is how you do an Excel you just put like a dollar sign next to it let me well it's worth a try to see if that works or not uh to make this a constant because I'm going to do this let me see what it did E4 so it needs to be E4 every time nope that's not it so I don't really know how to make that eon constant so I am going to have to manually modify that which kind of stinks E4 F4 E4 it's crazy I haven't used excel in so long like possibly I don't know 10 years or more and I can remember how to do stuff in Excel I've been using Google Sheets for a really long time now and I I don't know how to do that uh okay so let's E4 F4 A5 B5 all right so let's just see if this is at all reasonable uh this one yeah actually this looks like it works out so this one was the one from from Marietta which comes in second place in terms of distance this one is the one from Stubenville which which comes in first place in in terms of being the closest and this one is farthest away and this is Austin Texas so obviously this is not like a completely conclusive test it was only three uh three locations but I think that that makes me pretty certain that this should work if you see anything that I'm missing oh I had to just do um dollar signs for both of them oh man I was so close Okay so I think this worked so basically this is the formula that we need that'll give us these numbers and then we sort by these numbers it sounds simple when I say that but if you tuned in yesterday and saw how much trouble I had with trying to sort things you'll know that it's it's not that simple at least for me it's not that simple all right so um let me check the live chat quickly um Sam says you can use Google Sheets it's a free backend for small project projects yes you can I've actually done projects like that uh and it's really cool I've done it before to store form data and I also had uh one of the students had to do a website as a like a senior project like a senior thesis project and he um I I helped work with him on it this was just this past uh spring he he did the project and I advised him to use Google Sheets for a backend and Pull It in uh with JavaScript like real time it ended up being really really cool uh and it worked and I uh when he gave his presentation his classmates were impressed with his site so I was really happy for him he actually got a job as a Java developer out near Washington DC uh which is awesome Yep Sam says you can write app script and it will serve data as a web app Sam says I'm probably going to write going to probably write a blog post about it it's really cool awesome go for it Sam I'll read that blog post send me a link to it when it's done uh yeah you can do cool stuff with um the back like I know I've I've gotten form data and then based on that form data I've sent the data to uh obviously I've logged it into Google sheet but then I've also sent emails out from from uh from the Google sheet uh with Gmail so like all automatically happening so really cool stuff um Brandon says this this site has some js Snippets for calculating distance between lat and longitude cool I think I think this is going to work the way we did it if it doesn't and I start getting some weird stuff happening I'll check out what some other people did but usually I'm all for looking up with other people did not Reinventing the wheel but in this case I thought I'd just test my idea and even if you know everybody else already figured this out before me it feels good that I did it myself and didn't look it up I mean if I did this all the time I'd never get anything done but every once in a while it's nice it's nice to do that so let's at least try to get you know do this math and get that working let me see what time it is 330 an hour and a half okay um yeah let's maybe try to get a little bit more a little bit more done so just trying to think where I should do this I like this git location function being really simple so I don't think I'm going to add anything to it it's just literally going to get to location and so probably want another function and let me see actually I just realized now I haven't merge the Sorting into master so whenever I made this Branch based on master I don't have any of that in there and I wish I did have it in there I really don't want to do it on the same Branch but I want some of that how about this um let me obvious I think this is possible and it shouldn't make any it shouldn't mess anything up but I can just merge the branch that we were doing the Sorting on into this branch and then I'll have those changes correct I'm going to try it first I'm going to save this stuff where is my okay so in my terminal I have it set so to show a little asteris when there's changes uh so it may or may not happen when your terminal depending on how you set it up so this tells me I type get status it tells me what changed and now I'm going to do get commit and I'm just going to write am okay that means I'm going to add and write a commit message at the same time which I use this a lot because normally you know I'm making really small commits and it's fine to do that occasionally you want to maybe break it up and only commit certain files uh you know individually so get commit am and I'm just going to say uh get location yeah get user location that's pretty much all we did right we just got the user location all right and all right great everything worked so now I'm going to merge the other Branch uh I forgot what I called it and events sorted okay so let's do a get merge event sorted uh oh and looks like we're going to have merge conflicts oh no we didn't okay it's just asking me to do a a message I don't know um um I'm always really terrible about merge messages like I just wanted to merge the branches I don't know what to say um merge features into geolocation BR all right not sure if that's decent commit message or not but it's all I can come up with right now so I'm going to close I really kind of wish I didn't set this to come up in Adam it's actually a lot easier just to have it come up in like Nano or something right in the terminal uh it's more of a pain to do it an Adam so there we go yep so you check this out if you haven't done merging before with Git check out maybe like two days the episode I did I think two days ago we did some merging and stuff maybe three days ago so at some point this week I went through like more thoroughly how to do merges so I actually kind of wish I had merge conflicts because I didn't get to demonstrate that live and that would have been probably useful if you've never had any conflicts just to see the process for resolving this but I'm sure it'll happen one day when I'm streaming so we'll get to see it at some point so let's check out what we have here awesome okay so this gives us a much better picture of what this page is actually going to look like once we get all the Sorting sorted and um so here here's what we want we're going to save some of this data how I going to save this all right so this is the part where I may need your help because I'm feeling really uh kind of tired and my brain is not working so here's what we want to do let's go back to our list just to keep keep me on track uh so we've got this we've got this we we need to compare location so let's do this let's compare this and then what I'm worried about is getting to the point where I'm actually sorting so I obviously need to do the comparison save that data and then do something with that data to sort it uh but then have that associated with the actual of the rest of the data for the event okay so hopefully that makes sense uh to you all okay so where we at we'll just do another function here let's go compare compare location I kind of just want to say l just loc but I've already used location so I'm just going to stick with that it probably would have been sufficient just to say look uh all right so here's what we want to do we want to take are oh actually we need we need this so we need to save I'm thinking maybe I ought to just save this into state if there's any reason why I shouldn't just save it into State instead of just some variable somewhere let me know but uh I don't I can't really think of any reason I couldn't just put this in state so uh let's see I'm going to break it out into two things so it's going to be uh this Dot and let's use an arrow function um Arrow function is going to as Patrick uh so eloquently wrote in the live chat yesterday it's going to lexically bind the value of this so basically this is going to mean what I want it to mean so uh you can check out I I tried to explain it I think yesterday in my stream so you can check that out or uh you know look it up for a a better explanation than I gave so now I don't want to say this right here what I want to say is this set State and we're going to say curly brackets and we want um user lat and we want that to be position okay uh let me know if I do I have to Define this up here first before I do this so let me know I'm going to finish it out with this one but then uh if if you know off hand otherwise I'll just save it and see if I get an error uh and then we'll know set States I it seems like I'm doing this with a lot less errors than yesterday if you're here yesterday you know it was slightly painful uh all the all the mistakes I was making just you know syntax errors spelling errors logic errors it's all over the place errors okay so let me comment this out quickly just to save this and see what's going on see if it works where I don't know where I put it events there go okay so uh Patrick says not sure if it is required but I have always seen the default State get initialized with all the values okay cool I'm I'm fine with doing that I actually think it's it would be helpful for someone trying to read this if they could see everything that is is going to end up being in State instead of having to read through and piece together what's there so I'm going to do that even if it's not necessary so uh so this may not be necessary but I think it would just be good practice so how should I data type onance I'm I'm thinking I I don't really need to set this to anything uh is there a way that I can just set this with no value should I just make it at this point an empty string is that is that legit would that be the best way to do that oh man Patrick I remember you told me I'm pretty sure you told me the same thing yesterday Patrick just says don't call set state twice and I definitely forgot that um it's not like it's once Patrick reminds me of it it's like H that's obvious but for some reason I just cannot remember it all right so there we go so let's say man I was I have uh Spotify going in my headphones and I've been listening to a song I don't even liked for like three minutes and I just realized that I I hate when that happens okay so this should work and I just want to make sure I'm not getting an error anywhere oh here we go so this is nope not events yet let's click events I'm going to I'm just going to reset the dev server there we go okay so it loads we're not getting we're not getting any uh you know error screen there I'm not getting any errors I have the uh console open and Dev tools on my other screen no errors there oh you zero oh yeah why yeah obviously uh it's a number I'm going for so Rohan both Rohan and Patrick are saying use zero it's valid L and long longitude yep okay so let's use zero instead zero okay and yeah so that that reloaded no errors at least no errors related to that uh I always have a few errors when I'm developing locally just it basically for like I don't know where but something with fetching some script uh I think it has to do with me doing it from local hosts and it it works when I have it a legit URL okay so Patrick saying in this case and yesterday setting state twice wouldn't have made a difference but in the case where you are changing values that are displayed in the Dom you will cause two updates okay thanks for explaining that so I mean I was definitely I mean I was convinced that I shouldn't be doing it twice just to not you just to keep my code a little more simple but that's that's also an even better reason there uh so thanks Patrick for that all right Quincy says I've got to run to a meeting but it's been a blast hanging out with you all and watching Jesse code live usually I just watch when time permits and double speed thank you so much for uh joining in today Quincy this this really made my day and I really appreciate it I'll see you all right so I too would like to um would like to be gone soon uh cuz I've been at work for a long time and I'd like to go home so let's do a little bit more with this I just hate to leave this commented out so let's at least get this finished and then I will go home maybe I'll go home actually I have to review a bunch of uh job applications for the uh web developer position that um so we're hiring a web developer here and uh I've gotten a little bit behind on reviewing the application and I need to have them all done by tomorrow afternoon so I don't have that I think I maybe at most have like five more to review so it's not a huge deal I can usually get them reviewed like I don't know maybe 15 minutes per application it takes me depending some some people are like really obviously not qualified so I can kind of very quickly ruled them out uh okay so here's where we want to do our math so we want let's see so we want to in trying to think how to do this the best way okay so we have this saved in state so we're good there um it just occurred to me that I I want to be careful I don't want this function to ever be called if we don't have these right cuz then it won't be able to do anything it'll it'll just give different so I don't think we have to worry about it right now to do what we want to do but I I need to remember um there has to be some some safeguard that if the user has not shared their location then then this doesn't work cuz I don't want uh errors to come up uh because of that so I'll have to think about the best way to accomplish that but for now we just want to do um all right so let me think we want to get we basically want for each event we want a value that is the result of what we got you know in our spreadsheet so basically we want this value to be attached somehow to each event so that we can sort by it so that's going to be the goal of this function the end goal will have this be attached to each event all right oh okay it looks like I I uh made a mistake earlier and uh Patrick is pointing this out Patrick said he was not arguing for using zero he was saying that if zero is a valid latitude and longitude null would be a better idea uh it says it says this has not been initialized okay so Brandon says latitude longitude 0 Z put you on the west coast of Africa and the ocean so Patrick says yes set the default to null test against that and Brandon agrees with Patrick all right thanks for clarifying that uh I really I know I said this yesterday I'll say it again today you all are very patient with me because sometimes it takes me a while to get what you're saying and I really appreciate that so let me go up here no Okay cool so here's here's where uh my my thinking is I'm not exactly sure what to do I'm trying to think how do I go about attaching these values these values to the events so I'll have the events already stored they're they're basically already stored in state at at this point uh we'll have yeah we'll have the default stored did we store it on on uh load or not or does it happen when we sort I don't think we actually store anything in do we store anything in state yeah we do on component did Mount so in in state we're storing this props data okay so all everything we need is already in this props data so it should be we should go to um set state data and then it should be like dot do something right so data dot h so I should do something like I'm doing down here basically I I want to uh loop through everything so let me show you here so basically I want to look Bas I mean in a sense like we could do a map so it's going to be this state data right and we're going to map that and then inside of that I want to well first of all grab the latitude and longitude make the comparison and then the result of that I will use this I'll use set State and then I'll set I'll add yeah I think at that point I will add something into the state for for this particular particular one how would I I'm just thinking what what would this mean inside of here or what would be the right okay so I I've explained it about as as far as I can think to do it let me know if that makes sense okay so Patrick's uh Patrick's saying this props data map okay good so at least I was on the right track there and then insert a distance to event property on each event okay good so that's what I'm thinking the only thing I'm a bit worried about is um if I use map will that preserve this or will I have to just let me know so do I need to throw an arrow function somewhere to preserve the value of this so I can do this set State um let me know all right so within here let's go with oops let me do the arrow function so that I can lexically bind this um and let's go with this state data map function and oh actually Patrick says this props data map is there a reason why I should use this props data map instead of this state data map I mean obviously uh the same at at least on initial load props would be the same as uh whatever is in in data but if some other sorting has happened after that point then they would be different okay St map function wait a second sorry I just got to sorry if you get motion sck that was probably I just wanted to check the syntax and I can call this if event right I don't think I will need to know the you know have that I in there at this point I don't think I have any use for that all right so within this we're going to say okay all right so Patrick says in response to my question about you props versus state state is fine but don't forget to capture that in a variable and then set state with the modified data map is a pure function that is going to return the modifications okay all right so we need to do some math first actually I need to look at the uh how this is in the API so we need ACF location map and then lat or LNG okay I'm going to show this on my other screen so I can see it when I'm doing this so we're going to say so we need this I'm just I'm going to just type this out so I get it all out and then we'll clean it up so I need this uh state right what do we call this user lad this state yeah user L uh minus and that's going to be event. ACF do what was it uh location map dolet okay so you're going to do that and then it's going to be plus um okay so that was our basic formula uh that we wanted to use all right so the result of this is what we want to set as the value for and what were Patrick had a name for it I liked it I'm I'm trying to find it in the live stream distance to event so I like that name so property on each event okay so we want to say all right so Patrick the last all we we just got a question here when when will the data visualization be available in uh free code academy I'm assuming you meant free code Camp correct uh so if so I don't know when the data visualization will be available uh but Quincy the founder of free code Camp was just in the chat a few minutes ago and said that the new curriculum uh will be up and running as soon as possible uh so no dates given but they're working really hard on it and it'll be up soon and I haven't looked at the beta curriculum for a long time so I can't say for sure but I'm assuming that all the data visualization stuff uh will be in there and completed you can check it out out though uh I can't remember what the URL is but if you uh you know search for the free code Camp beta uh curriculum you'll be able to get a preview of what it's what it's going to be like uh if if you want to kind of get a jump start you can even work through some of the stuff some of the uh the problems and um the lessons Okay so back to this all right so let me go back to what Patrick just said to review this so we need capture that in a variable and then set state with modified data okay so um should we say let distance equals there we go and then set State I have a feeling I'm not doing this the way that uh Patrick was trying to describe it to me so so uh I fully am am aware of that so just Patrick just let me let me know sorry and uh let me know it's going so this set State and let's do we need distance to a vent so it's going to be this set State data no no no what was it shoot actually we may have there's probably a better way to do this but I just I think we actually have use of uh this value for the iterator because we can go data and then put I in there and that'll give us the one that we want right uh so this say State data um I and then we're going to add the field right so distance to events equals distance okay let's see con new data this is oh yeah con I'm I'm trying to uh based on the wisdom that you all shared with me about when to use const and let so My Philosophy was like I always use let unless I knew I wanted a const but it seemed like the better way is use con all the time unless you really need let so I I still haven't broken myself of my first habit and but I'm going to try to so this state data map const new data Oh shoot that's not what even I don't think that's what Patrick was talking about con new data equals this state data map there we go so he was talking about um which I can use that in there anyway I suppose because it's going to go again so here I need okay so he say don't don't set the state inside the loop okay I kind of was wondering about that I I assumed you would let me know when I tried to do it if if I shouldn't do it uh Pat said after this set State all right so const so this is where we're going to do to const um I'm just going to write write this how your put it new data and then after we're going to do this set state or wait this set state I'm just going to copy this for a second uh oh no I'm going to copy this what you put in but Patrick put in um there we go this set St data new data and then I can remove this and what I need to do is then should this be return instead of actually making this a variable do I need that is is that uh not necessary here I guess I'll hit save and see see what happens all right well no errors yet so that's a good sign but what I really need to see is let's see says you need to okay so uh sha says yeah yeah return it good okay Patrick says you need to return it but you need to set the new property with the calculated value this set State yeah you're right I just I just read uh he says you need to set the new properly calculated value so I turned my head over and just saw what I was doing here realized it and then turned back and I saw Patrick said that wipes out your data so yeah oh man um this is the same thing I did yesterday I think I just tried to push it and get too much done when my brain was just not ready just too tired for all this um okay what was I I did want to ask really quickly so these are the Dev tools for react so I wanted to show them and also ask a question so you have a react tab um I forget I it's some sort of extension I think that you have to download for this to work but I just wondered I can I can see props but I don't see anywhere for State although I wonder perhaps I just overwrote on my state and that's why I can't see it oh no Lyon just joined and said can't believe I Got a notification uh 2 hours in I'm really sorry I um I set the notifications to to go out beforehand uh so I'm not sure if I can do anything to remedy that except maybe uh create the event earlier in the day so today I created it kind of late because I had a Twitter poll on the topic uh so but it was all kind of late I spent all morning in meetings so everything was delayed more than I wanted it to so I'll try to get the event scheduled earlier in the day and hopefully that'll stop the um the notifications from going out late as well okay all right so Patrick is giving me lots of stuff here let's let's go back to this um Patrick says event distance to event equals in return event all right so distance all right lynon says it's okay I'll catch up tomorrow cheers all right um I'm just I'm going to read uh I had a comment just come up not necessarily related to what we're working on but I'm just going to read it right now to give my my brain a slight break here uh uh mamy um is saying hi this helps me a lot and thank you Jesse some things are small and the videos help me review over and over until I see what you are clicking and it is fun Jesse I am new I nothing I know nothing at all okay cool um thanks for watching um yeah I'm I'm glad you're getting something out of it uh I think I said at the beginning this is kind of more advanced stuff so uh if you're just learning this might be kind of difficult I'll try to do my best to explain and um yeah you're saying some things are really small so watch it to see what I'm clicking so um yeah so I mean I'll try to um keep the you know everything as large as I can in terms of font size and everything but let me know if it is really too small uh and you can't see all right so let's finish this up so event distance to events all right so we need oops okay so we need to return the event so uh let me read out what Patrick's saying uh for those of you watching later on uh so he's saying we need all Rohan says got to go really sleepy yeah what is it like 2 or 300 in the morning where you're at probably I can't believe you stayed up uh this late as it is so yeah get some sleep I'll see you um actually not tomorrow uh I won't be streaming tomorrow because I will be hopefully taking a nap because I'm going to drive through the night uh about 8 hours uh to take uh my family uh to the beach for vacation so I won't I won't be streaming tomorrow but uh I'll it might be a week before I um I stream again so thanks for staying up this late and hanging in there Rohan all right sorry Patrick I keep messing around and uh you're being really patient with me so all right so events so from what I'm what I'm thinking that Patrick is saying here um is that we need to return where is it at I'm losing it here okay um then return event okay so event. distance to event return event set event. distance to event equals oops let's do this all right this is making a little bit of sense to me so hopefully I'm doing this right and then we're going to return event awesome and then that's what's going to be so event now this event uh with and I guess I don't need this huh uh so this event is now the value of uh new data right and okay Patrick Patrick says there's a big thunderstorm uh rolling in uh so might might lose power uh well I I hope you don't lose power uh for your sake and for my sake because you're helping me out a lot right now uh says he's rolling in over the mountain where if you don't mind me asking where where are you at Patrick I mean just in general uh if you got if you got mountains around you turn EV all right uh so Patrick let me ask you okay East East Tennessee cool um I'm from I'm from West Virginia myself so um not not super far uh from Tennessee actually trying to think is there any point I don't think there's any point where West Virginia borders Tennesse but it it's pretty close in the southern point of West Virginia so um I have been to Tennessee a few times uh really nice uh my wife has has family in Tennessee Okay so Patrick am I am I doing this right so far at least in in this area oh cool Patrick says uh drives through West Virginia on the way to see family in Pittsburgh really cool um yeah I said I'm I'm about um to drive from where I'm at to Pittsburgh only takes about 30 minutes it depends on where at in Pittsburgh I I mean I can get to the uh like the west side of Pittsburgh in about 30 minutes takes longer of course to get you know through the city over to the east side but uh yeah Pittsburgh is a cool City yeah if anybody is ever around Pittsburgh or anything um let me know uh I don't know I don't know if we'll get to meet up or or what if that'll be if that'll be possible oh cool uh coropolis Pat says coropolis by the airport oh yes so that's only about a half hour drive from where I'm at awesome and it's actually only about I don't know 15 25 minutes away from where I grew up uh which was right on the border of Pennsylvania and West Virginia uh at one point in my I could walk in my backyard and cross the border into Pennsylvania I used to like to stand like right in the line between West Virginia and Pennsylvania and uh like say like one of my feet was in one state and the other was in the other state so when I was a kid I thought that was really cool okay awesome so Patrick says thinks that's right uh okay log it all right cool um yeah let's see what's going on here let me see she want me to log it mean like console log it I'm like nervous now every time I type something in I'm going to look over and uh Patrick's going to type in like LOL what are you doing n Patrick's really cool about everything and patient with me but um it's it's happened quite a few times oh cool you went to um Patrick went to Moon middle school for a year in seventh grade oh really yeah I know yeah definitely been uh in that area plenty of times so that's really cool yeah I have cousins that went to um West alany uh High School up there so not not in the same area Pittsburg obviously but you might be familiar with that if you were uh if you were up in that area oh cool Brian lives in Pittsburgh too awesome did anyone go there was a Tech Conference in Pittsburgh uh did did you happen to go to that Brian or did you I just found out about it like two days before it happened and they had already stopped selling tickets I really wanted to go and uh maybe like do some interviews like I did uh for a conference a couple weeks ago but maybe next year okay Patrick says this is uh Patrick Patrick says I'm old this was a long time ago uh oh actually I I keep like think why is why am I not seeing anything happening I'm never actually calling compare location anywhere so that actually here's what I should do why not call I I said I wanted to make sure that we had the users location before we did this so let's just call compare location from within here and I mean right now this is this is happening right away but it will happen uh once the user actually clicks on something at some point yeah uh Brian asked which conference I can't remember what it was called um I just saw it on Twitter somebody tweeted about it but um yeah there was some sort of Tech conference they had lots of different stuff like front end stuff back end all all different kinds of uh like programming things uh and it it looked cool it was held at some like college I think like Community College or something uh in Pittsburgh uh yeah so it it looked really cool I'd like to go next year I did I followed the uh conference Twitter so if you check out my Twitter and uh my followers it's it should be one of the uh most recent uh accounts that I followed I actually think it might be cool to like maybe apply to speak at at that conference I've never spoken at a um at a Tech conference so I think that would be really cool I I used to teach so I'm I'm used to speaking for a long time and I guess I do the same thing when I do my streams uh so I don't think it would be like too much of a stretch for me it might be fun I just have to think of a good topic that uh might be helpful to people all right this compare location all right let's try this I saved it nothing happened I saw no change at all in uh in Dev tools or anything all right I think I think that's because my server once again is frozen oh P Patrick says he's terrified of public speaking more power to you and anyone who can do it oh well it's I don't know I I never um I'm not going to say I've never gotten like that nervous feeling beforehand but I've never um been like really really nervous about public speaking before uh so I I guess I'm kind of lucky that I I just really never had that so it's not like it's not really any credit to me of being brave or anything because I've never really felt uh fear about it so it's uh oh man so that's not let me show you what happened this is definitely not the result that I wanted so I'm doing something wrong somewhere oh I get yeah obviously I didn't fix that um let's see it's giving me f to fetch whoa actually it's saying the fetch failed that should not happen that that seems an unrelated issue to what we're doing I'll show you what I was what I'm getting I'm getting all these errors let's see let me just get rid of this for a second um the old debugging by commenting things out not the most efficient way to do it but it works eventually all right so I mean that did at least bring this stuff back so that's good what is going on let me get rid of this bring it back up huh why is this happening okay where I this is looking more useful I forgot to probably forgot to say 39 event 39 what am I doing wrong here uh it looks like I'll show you the error again but it looks like it's saying okay so cannot repr property set state of undefined and us us so is this saying that this is not working why is this oh uh I'm not exactly sure but it could it be since I'm calling it from in here I also need to make this an arrow function I'm not really sure but why not why not make them all Arrow functions and then they all match okay so uh I didn't get the error again so this is still the old error so this is all the new stuff did not get the err so that's that's good um let me do a refresh and get rid of all this stuff just to be sure show you what I got Okay cool so didn't get the error but oh and here we go got it again so I did it was just delayed hey all right fabian's here hey how's it going hey I I want to know um Fabian or Fabian or how do you prefer your name to be pronounced I know it's hard to type that out but try if you could I would love to uh say it correctly so let me know also thanks for joining all right Chen says hello I just saw the stream but have to go now all right well thank thanks for stopping in for a bit uh yeah you have a nice day too uh this is L what looks like LOL LOL uh says I can't speak in public uh but also I need a job so that I can get surgery wow um I'm I hope it's not like anything super serious but um and now the message is retracted I'm sorry if you didn't want me to read that out uh now I see the message is retracted so uh sorry about that actually just so that everybody knows I do kind of read out the live chat a lot so if you have something you don't really want to be read out direct message me on Twitter and then I I won't share anything from a direct uh message on Twitter if um unless you tell me like go ahead and share it um so anyway I hopefully though you all if if you're trying to get a job in programming hopefully this helps you a little bit um or may maybe helps you make a decision as to whether or not you want to do do this I I don't claim that this is what it's like for all developers but it's what it's like for me and uh I'm a a frontend developer transform function position to position all right let me all right let me move this out of here so I'm looking so F so I asked Fabian how to pronounce his name and he just typed his name in I so is it is Fabian okay I'm really thinking there's no way that that's how people pronounce that in France okay so anyway he said uh transform function position to position and the arrow function function so where sorry for not getting this at all but uh Fabian where where are you um directing me to change this because I'm I'm not sure like the error message I'm getting is for this line but I wasn't sure if it had to do with anything I'm doing up here since I'm calling it there you transform error functions to use this set State oh oh okay now I see where that talking about this here I just totally didn't didn't see that at all sorry about that now that I see this your previous messages super clear um shoot you know what I mentioned something about that earlier and then totally forgot uh so all right so let's try it out now whoa what just happened I got some errors here did I did I mess it up I mean this this isn't whoops L 35 okay I see it L 35 what am I oh okay okay shoot I forgot to take out function sorry about that that was a silly mistake okay all right thanks thanks Sebastian I just saw uh there's a delay in the um you know between what what I'm doing and and what you all uh see and here so but Sebastian found that and let me know what it was you do you still need okay and also uh Bal found it as well Brandon says it's pronounced Fabian Fabian according to google okay so maybe I'm not that far off what all right for some reason it's it's still showing me what I had before restart server oh really Sebastian says it's like a 5second delay that's not bad at times it's been like more closer to a minute so I guess that's good actually the stream the stream Health has been good you know the whole time so uh not bad I was actually really worried because all the thunderstorms here that I wouldn't even be able to stream so we're having power outages but um nothing nothing has happened so far and this has been a really long stream all right there we go okay awesome let's see make sure we have this great Okay so load everything all right let's see all right so my this St see my console log is not firing so why am I not actually I should probably no I don't want an error function here right because I want this to be actually what's inside this um uh Patrick says maybe you need to revoke geolocation off so it will ask you again yeah actually now that I think about it it should have I guess I took that console log out didn't I the git location console log I'm going to I actually want to add it back in because I want to see if this is doing anything um I'm just I guess I don't need both latitude and longitude I just need oops this States um yeah so this get location yeah this is not yeah this is not working let me show you what happened here so I'm not getting that console log of the latitude like I should be and I'm not I'm not getting anything I wonder I'm just going to conso L you know basically anything uh yeah it's not showing me anything I um my my thought right now is uh what if I've exceeded the amount of times I could use this uh you know in like I I've just refreshed the page way too many times Maybe so I'm wondering if this is just hanging and not not getting down to where it needs needs to be to run anything else yep all right so see that worked when I log that when I put it up above above here um but let's see if I can find and I'm just going to verify that if I put it down here it's not going to do anything so I save that I'm going to do a refresh no actually it did work this time I don't know what happened before and why it it didn't work and then it worked oh okay sorry Patrick I just saw that uh your last message so location um always ask okay all right let's see okay awesome so it asks okay so at least you know this this portion worked and so then I'm assuming but we'll check that if I log position that I will in fact get the position and I need to I got to remember to keep refreshing because it's not going to run that again uh I think just if I reload the modules there we go there's the position the Geo position object great all right so that is running all right line 45 needs to be an arrow function okay so it does I'd considered that and then thought it might mess things up so hopefully this is it and this fixes it I'll bring this over so we can all see the result in the console okay got that and that's it we should have gotten more than that right so we should have gotten after this it should have ran compare location which should have logged event correct yes at least um all right shoot starting to run out of ideas wellow I just checked my phone I have 11 slack messages doesn't look doesn't look like it's anything that's serious I think it's all just people joking so not going to look at them uh okay so Fabian says this set State doesn't immediately change the state okay so where am I at with this set state so talking about this this time when I use it up here on line 37 yelden says uh do you use routes a set State also reloads the Dom okay I'm I'm not sure um what you mean by routes uh yelden could you explain it a little bit more uh so I can give you a better answer try to log this state okay all right and this is turning into what the heck much more of an epic stream than I expected I mean I should have expected it more I've never done this before so well my plan for the stream is I know what I want to happen but I don't know how to make it happen then I should expect that it could take a while uh I think my Dev server just needs reset I I know I've said this a million times already but I just I really need to figure out why this keeps happening uh because it's like occasionally it happens frequently and it's annoying sometimes I go uh pretty far without it happening okay that should be working now if I refresh yeah oh goodness okay but at least we got State okay so that's what we wanted so here we console log the state um right here on line 38 so let's see okay we do in fact have user lat Us lawn okay so we have that so we have this state data it it has it has the data in it so I kind of wish it didn't and then we would have found a problem um okay Yen uh is explaining what he meant uh so react router allows you to have routes for multiple Pages just curious if you're using that um do you use the react addon for Chrome I do have the react addon for Chrome um it but I'm I'm haven't I don't use it a lot I'm not that familiar with it is there something in here that would help at this point uh let me know and I'll I'll check it out in here uh I really want to know like should should I not be able to see like I can see props right here is there any way to see state right here here so I don't have to console log State um and then answer your question yoden I'm not using react router uh for this project uh because I'm doing this I'm using nextjs with this project and it comes with their own router I am doing some custom routing so if you check out the GitHub repo for this look at the server.js file you can see some of the custom routing I'm doing uh I needed to do some parameterized routing uh because there's some like blog style Pages going on so um but basically it's just the default routing from nextjs uh with with the exception of uh slight modifications but I would like to learn other like more about react router and other ways to do it uh because I I think I think I'm limiting myself uh by not you know definitely by not learning that I could be doing more um dragos I'm using adom uh from from that's from GitHub right yeah GitHub makes Adam uh okay so let's goes so Fabian said you're logging State inside location with which is triggered seconds after calling compare location okay so should we try it somewhere else should I try should I try somewhere else maybe I don't know here or I me right it should be oh oh goodness okay so when I log it from there there's nothing in data all right so let's check this out so inside here it has the data inside here no data so we're actually calling get location first and then from in there is compare location so what's happening what is happening between here and here that's wiping that out oh okay so Fabian is saying I need to move uh this function call inside here all right let me refresh um yelden says where is your state set do you have a main component that is housing the state and you're accessing it from a subcomponent um all right so that yeah that did it in terms of you know now we're getting we're getting data here all right but now we cannot read property lad of undefined and that's on line 48 so we're getting somewhere cuz that's a new error um all right so in here event ACF location map oh shoot I know it's happening um I don't have I don't have these set for all of the events cuz we only did it for three of the events so it's it's iterating through the first three once it gets to four it's saying this is undefined so um I guess I need to let me see what it looks like if I don't have it so here's here's the uh what this looks let me scroll down a bit find one that doesn't have this so ACF okay so it just doesn't have it at all so if I check for has if has in property so I'm going to do this and say um if I don't know there may be a better place to put this if statement so um this oops event. ACF has on property that's the right one right has in property I don't know why it didn't autofill that for me um and then we want location map then we want to do that okay so that should at least get rid of that error because it won't attempt to read that assuming that that was the right name for that function uh Brandon says I think fabian's on the right track try move and compare location call to within the geolocation call bag um Pedro says it's not really an IDE it's just Visual Studio codes this is referring to to Adam actually um actually Pedro I'm using Adam and you're right yeah Adam it's not an it's not really an IDE it's um it's just a code editor uh but yeah I mean oh nice I didn't even see what happened CU I was paying attention ention there but that that is uh awesome um it's progress all right great so yeah this is this is good so we can see that was what was happening the first three actually have have values and okay so we see here so did it's thing it did the math and it actually added now uh this to event so this is this is now exactly where we wanted on this object so now we can sort by this so actually let me where am I I want to double check the state so I don't need this anymore here cuz that worked um but I want to check the state at the end here here just to be sure right and let's see let me check this one there we go okay so we do have it it is there awesome so I guess I don't need this then because the state is yeah yoden said this is where tdd saves your sanity so test driven development you are correct um I definitely want to learn how to do test driven development and use it and it would definitely be worth the time spent in learning it yeah okay so amilio ask the way you fixed is that some events don't have a Latin long right yeah actually I'm I don't think I really explained what I was doing so sorry about that uh when I did we were getting an error and it was saying like basically it can't find I forget what the exact error was but basically it was telling me that this did not exist for some of these events uh which made sense because I didn't actually put in a value for some of those events so when I did this so I checked the API uh data just the the raw um data here let me bring it on the screen just to step you through what happened so I checked it here and I saw that ACF you could see it it didn't even have like a blank value or anything it just didn't have it at all it did not have that field so I went in and said if event. ACF has own property location map so this this basically says if if this is even a property here it's just like it says right so then go ahead and and do this calculation otherwise just skip skip down to you know do the return event um and then that ensures that it's not looking for this when it doesn't exist and then that fix the error okay alelo ask I was wondering does the Google API puts puts the data when creating the new event and setting the address I'm not exactly sure what you're asking amelo um uh could you like explain a little bit more so I can give you a good answer uh please uh okay so Patrick saying you can do uh an else on the check for location map add distance to EV to those without it and set it to Infinity then at the end of your map sort do your sword oh okay so basically so basically saying if an event doesn't have uh a location it's it's going to show up at the end then uh Fabian says argue mutating the state without calling set State react won't be aware of something has changed Patrick says you're very close to having this done I'm glad about that oh Amelia says where does the Latin longitude come from for the events oh okay yeah uh so I'll show you so here's what it is coming from so I have here um in WordPress a Google map where you can put in uh the the city and then so you put it in there and then what you get from the API is assuming you put it in you get this here and that information has come from the Google Maps API of the uh latitude and longitude so that's where I get that data from hopefully that explains that answers your question okay so got Patrick saying um map is a pure function where is he mutating State directly and Fabian says event object is updated so so we're talking about where I here all right Patrick replied right but map is pure so it is operating on a copy alelo says got it thanks all right awesome I'm glad I uh glad I answered your question yelden said I'd learn moex or Redux for way better State management using set state has its flows yeah I I want to go with mobex I um I was at a conference recently and I um I listened to a talk about Redux and mobex showing like the differences between them and how to basically showing comparing like how you would do the same thing in both and I I think I definitely want to go with with mobc so when I get a chance I want to want to learn that yelden says mutating state is dangerous anyway all right so there there's some discussion going on about this portion uh in particular this uh in that would react be able to pick up on this change in state right is that the uh yeah I think that's that's it so so I think fabian's saying that since I didn't use this set states to change the state here react won't know about it so should should I then instead of setting it here should I use set state would that fix it could I use set State inside of this and would it work if let's say I just change this to um set State and then made a distance to event at this point I think I'll just try it and see if it see if it works so this set state distance to events oh okay now I got some answers so probably shouldn't have done that uh Patrick says mutate all your data then set State uh Fabian says you need to clone event objects all right so let me get rid of what I just did here oops all right so we need to mutate everything and then use set state to update it all at once instead of trying to update it every time this for every uh every po every event right yeah I'm pretty sure that's just saying okay so let's not need to CL object all right Yen says um this is why Marx and immutable State makes things a lot cleaner and easier easier to manage lots of tutorials around yeah uh yielding yeah definitely I mean I'm not I don't I don't disagree with you at all um if you haven't seen any of the previous streams sorry I got to get some water my throat's uh starting to get really sore um so basically the story is for this site is it was a surprise project that I did not expect uh it was someone else's project um an outside company was supposed to do it and um basically it ended up that it needed to launch and I needed to be able to do it really quickly so yeah so I mean if I had more time I would have done this differently uh and there are definitely areas where I um I would say like I made decisions based on what could be done more quickly and and that was based on what I already knew how to do knowing that I didn't have the time to properly learn something new so uh but I definitely do want to learn mobex so the next time I do a project like this which there there are several projects in the future that will probably use the same kind of setup I will definitely try to learn mobx and incorporate that uh okay uh Patrick says my bad I totally whiffed on the Clone step actually Patrick I kind of think like probably an hour ago at this point you were mentioning something about that uh doing something similar to that so I think I erased that part that we were attempting to do so uh it's probably my fault uh yelden says you have a store file and all your status there and then you use dispatch yeah yeah okay cool uh so yoden was describing uh mobx so yeah I umum I have to look I took a lot of notes at the talk that I went to that uh talked about mobx and hopefully they're going to release the videos for that talk at some point it was syntax con was the conference so uh then maybe I can watch the video again uh and or check out a lot of the other video tutorials uh Fabian says it's important to clone because set state will compare Old State with new one but if you alter the Old State react won't be able to know what really changed Okay cool so um I'm going to ask a very probably aish question here uh but just for the sake of getting this done on time what's the best way like how should I clone this in terms of like what what syntax do I use um yelden also ask on this site do you know the users because i1 still does not Support es6 classes unless you use Babel so yeah I'm I am using Babel so um next JS uh automatically handles a lot of that stuff so actually don't yeah we tested this site 11 at some point I think we went through some testing so yeah we did so it doesn't actually the worst part of the site is some of the CSS because I'm using flexbox for some things and that doesn't work in i11 so um yeah so I mean realistically uh my boss is not concerned about me making things work in ie1 uh his his Viewpoint is it would probably be better for people to just update their browsers anyway if possible so and they're probably used to other parts of the internet work not working correctly so um it it somewhat does depend on our audience though realistically but uh in general if it's not going to cause a huge problem with our our audience um it does seem almost like uh I don't know in in a it kind of in a way it seems like it's better I'm I'm torn between this because part of me is like don't support i11 and put the pressure on everyone to upgrade i11 uh and use something that's better and I mean let's face it more secure right I mean you have less of a chance of getting malware and stuff if you have a newer browser too so it's not just a like I want to do cool stuff you know forget your old browser it's uh people need a reminder that you should be updating these things uh but then the other part of me is like I want everybody possible to be able to have the best experience on my site so I want to support all these older browsers so I'm a little bit torn between the two uh so I just I just kind of consider who the audience is and like when I make sites internally for the University here I have no problem just throwing up a b like a popup at the beginning saying like hey you're using an old browser you need to update this because I mean that's the security issue like I've had people using insanely old browsers like browsers that haven't been updated in seven years and um that's just unacceptable like at at the University I have gotten like bug reports and it says that they're using using browsers that are 7 years old and that's just crazy we can't like we can't have browsers that are 7 years old running on our computers here at the University so at some point we just have to force people to update so um anyway so sorry for the the rant on the side there okay so faban did answer my question that was more to the point before I went on my my little um Sidetrack thing here so he's saying um oh cool you're using the spread operator yeah awesome always love an excuse to use new features all right so let's do this uh so Fabian where are we at cons event clone event okay so let's do I'm assuming this has to be in here this seems like the only reason we'll place to put it to me not that I thought that much about it but uh const event clone equals cool okay all right so this is the spread operator oh Yen says spread operators love and template strings yeah for sure for sure I agree with you 100% okay so number one is this actually where I was supposed to put it I think so number two um we have event clone so does that mean now I should change this to event cloned and then and then at some point after I've changed event cloned then I set State I think I got this now I have I have the concept of what's Happening Now um let's let's try uh where am I at and now a map event return event cloned and this set whoops set state events oops is this what I really want no cuz I don't have a event I want yeah this isn't what I want I messed up at some point right okay I did forget there we go CL event cloned distance to event all right now we're returning turning from this event Clon great and now am I good so on line 50 do I have the right idea here of all right Andre says there's an error on line 44 what I got which's uh let's see saying objects are not iterable anyway hi Andre welcome I don't I don't remember uh seen you commenting before if you have sorry uh but anyway welcome welcome to the uh live stream uh thanks for for helping out okay spread operators for arrays okay and this is not not arrays oh it is first time awesome Andre welcome welcome I appreciate you uh you watching um is this your first time uh in case you didn't realize it already uh I I don't claim to be an expert this is just me doing my daily work and occasionally like today I attempt to do something that I really have no idea how to do and um usually everybody in the live chat gives me a lot of help sometimes I do things where I really do know what I'm doing and um it's probably more more useful to everyone watching this is one of the days where I'm getting a lot of benefit from from your expertise all right awesome so Ian saying the spread operator works also with objects now cool okay so my last question I I think I've I've changed events NOP I need to change it I guess it doesn't really matter if I change it here or not but I'm going to just for consistency event clone okay if not use cloned equals object assigned event and it's the same okay so fabian's giving an alternative in case the spread operator is not going to work uh for this so I mean actually this I guess I can this EST State event wait a second all right here's where I am oops sorry uh this set State I missed a few things in the live chat here I got to go back and see what's going on uh Patrick says this. set State uh new data and Fabian says and finally this do set State uh. data uh new new date um Patrick don't forget to name the property in this case yes um and ask what do you use to expose Advanced custom fields to WP API uh there's a plugin uh for I I mumbled that sorry Philip ask what do you use to expose Advanced custom fields in the WordPress API there is a plugin uh to expose Advanced custom Fields so I don't remember which plugin I use for sure uh so I can I can check it out when I finish this I kind of want to finish this right now uh before I go back to the WordPress thing but if you stick around for a couple of minutes hopefully it only takes a few minutes to get this this working and then I can check WordPress for you before I end the stream okay Patrick's new day data though um uh yelden said I tried to use spread on an object it doesn't work uh Patrick says are you using a weing a transpiler and um theen says yes oh okay philli just says was wondering if uh I wrote the Plugin or if there was a plugin yeah I didn't write that plugin I got it from from somewhere else so thaton okay all right we're have so there's there's a big discussion still about the um in the live chat about the spread operator um and whether or not this will work so actually let me let's just check this out hopefully I didn't do a lot to break ah shoot I broke I did too much to break this so just gonna get rid of this for now just so I can see what is going on whoops I need and actually I need this stuff okay that should do it oh shoot what is problem here okay so just I don't know if this will help your discussion about the spread operator but basically I am console logging event cloned just to see what it's giving me and here's what I get I get this object here um with all my stuff is that what uh uh Fabian is that what you expecting to see okay so basic say see yeah I sorry everybody I kind of ignored the live chat for a minute because I just thought there's definitely one way to solve this discussion just console log it and see what's going on okay so at least we now know that yes indeed we we do have a uh a copy of of event now so here's here's my question so this part I'm assuming is uh correct uh the part that I'm still I don't know about is now I need to after this all happens I need to set the state uh how do I how do I do and I'm sorry if you've already put this in the live chat this is one of those times where I'm I'm honestly slightly lost right now so uh please be patient with me I will say this though uh when I do streams like this where I am kind of lost for a lot of the time I learn a lot and uh I often don't don't really need um like the next time I do it I remember it and can look back and do it so all right so Fabian saying uh and Patrick are both saying saying this which okay now that now that you put that in there I remember uh you both pasted something like you pasted that in before or you uh wrote that in before so sorry for making you do that again um so is this what is this the right location for for this I mean I'm going to save it and just see if I get a bunch of errors all right lots of Errors now Yen says struggle helps yes it does for sure I mean it takes a long time it can be painful but it takes long time okay so all right so Patrick saying yes this is the race place to do that um oh my goodness now I it just clicked for me uh so in case it was confusing to anyone else watching here's what just clicked for me and this may have been obvious to you but the whole time I'm thinking like that I'm going to have to say set set State and somehow I'm going to set the state of event to event clone but then it occurred to me like wait a second there is no State event right this is this doesn't make any sense forgetting completely that this whole thing we named new data right so anyway um yeah so I I just needed to set data to new data and not anyway so hopefully you can see that that I finally just realized that um so anyway I wish I would have seen that like 15 minutes ago but oh well been staring at this for a long time now so okay but I am all right let me show you the errors that I'm getting right now and so unexpected character at line 54 the set State data new data um um Fabian says uh we had some some people asking about my uh my code editor again um Fabian says put it put Adam in the FAQ I have it in the description actually so um I don't mind people asking about it but uh today is it's actually like every half hour or so I think somebody asks about it which is totally cool I mean somebody has never watched the show before uh you know the stream off obviously wouldn't know uh I'm actually I kind of like that more people new it tells me that new people are joining because uh they're asking about the editor uh Patrick says to be fair I'm not talking commenting answering questions and typing while trying to code you have the harder job here yeah well that makes me feel a little bit better thanks for that Patrick uh I I will say like for sure I work I definitely work faster when I'm not streaming uh but I think it's a good tradeoff because I learn a lot when I do streams like this so I think the long run net effect is that more get a lot more gets done and the end result is a lot better than it would have been if I would just kind of do my own thing all the time and not stream especially with some of the pool requests that you have submitted they're just really amazing and uh I actually like I go through line by line and and try to understand what you're doing and I've learned a lot from that uh I really appreciate that okay so I showed you my um my error here so I got something going on with this set State uh maybe I messed something up when I was changing some things let me see okay so that's good we have this this oops yeah that looks good oh am I missing I think I'm I'm missing a p no I wasn't it was right here I was mistaken uh so that yeah this is closed this is closed all right so it's not like some obvious uh you know like missing curly curly bracket okay uh I'm gonna I'm G to check Fabian says yes courage Jess uh Brandon says streaming is smart you get free help while getting paid to do the job yeah yeah I mean I kind of like to think that I help people too but you're are right Brandon a lot of times I'm I'm getting help uh I'm getting a lot of help and um that's true I'm getting paid for it that's why I did have when I first started streaming I had some people ask about like like giving me donations and stuff and uh I I mentioned a couple times I'm getting paid right now because this is my my regular work so I just I don't really feel like I should take any money if I'm getting paid to do this at some point if I start doing like lots of streams like from home on my free time then maybe I'll think of some way to make money off of it uh if anything just uh I guarantee if I spent my time at home doing streams and videos my wife would get upset pretty quickly but at least if I could say like hey I'm bringing in more income she'd be a little bit happier I don't think she's listening to this if if you are listening back then you could let me know if that's the case oh okay Fabian all right uh I did copy so Fabian says did you copy this set state from chat it seems an invisible character uh has been put in yes yeah okay that explains it so so that's why I say unexpected character and it just says this uh right right here okay so awesome uh so let me um let me just get rid of all this and I'll type it out and then that way I should be pretty sure that I'm going to do it so this dot set state and I'm going to go data new data okay you could see I'm still trying to break myself with the semicolon habit if you notice occasionally when I get to the end like this I tab over I go over because I'm getting ready to put the semicolon in but I stopped myself all right let's see all right so I'm not getting that error again I got a different error but I don't think it's um I don't I don't think it's affecting the page negatively um all right so let's check this out let me show you what I got I got this error but I think that's at events 4 what the heck is at events 4 oh it's something about the sticky n yeah that's that's probably just has something to do with the uh hot module reloading and occasionally I get weird errors with that but of course I never get them you know on the live site because I'm not doing the hot modle reloading there uh okay that's better cool so let's now that we have this this let say data new data okay uh awesome job uh Fabian at catching that by the way CU that that was definitely the problem uh Alberto says yay for nondisplay characters I'm currently doing a lot of parsing um on uh sln a andf in my current project um okay so at this point I really wanted to actually get the sorted sorting working but honestly it's like almost 600 p.m. at my time and um I got in like trying to think how long I've been here at this point um I'm definitely I'm I'm definitely way past the uh amount of time that I am supposed to work and I expect that my wife is wondering where I am so I think I'm going to cut it short I really hate to leave it like right in the middle like this um especially since I'm not going to stream for a while so I'm going to do my best um when I I'm I I probably won't get to it for till after I get back from vacation but I want to do my best to actually now make this work with the sworting and uh thanks actually Patrick says sword AB uh a distance to event B distance to event hey distance to event okay so actually maybe I will sort it because Patrick just gave me what I need in here so um let's see so Patrick if I do the Sorting all right so let me paste in what Patrick just just so everybody can see this Patrick just uh pasted this in and but you need an else on location map that sets the distance to event on others okay cool um yeah I'm definitely uh I'm not going to have time to influent this so I am going to leave this in here like this just so that I mean normally I don't really like leaving in like partial code and commenting it out uh but in this case this is probably the best place for me to put it so I'll actually remember uh so at least I'll know where to go from um so this he is it you know put it above set state which makes sense uh so that basically uh if you're watching just just for explanation of uh in case I don't finish this in a stream and I just do it on my own uh basically if we sort before we set uh new data then uh react will react of course picks up on the change in data and since down here uh we're actually like we're actually rendering these sorry I got to scroll the way down um these events so we're rendering this this data in these events so if the order of this data if anything in data changes then it react's going to rerender these so um if we change the order based on location in state react picks up on the state change and then these will automatically reorder and that's exactly what we want to happen so basically that is the last step in this process is simply sorting by distance uh before we set this and then at that point when this gets set everything will rerender it will work so um so Patrick saying but you need an elone location map that sets the distance to event on others what I'm going to do I think is um either have the uh uh the person who's in charge of content go in and set the location for everything so I won't have to worry about not having a location in there or I'll just go in and do it myself and then I'm going to make that a required field so every new event added in it they have to put the location on it um I I don't think there's going to be anything like a online event or anything where there wouldn't be a location so I think I can get away with setting that as mandatory and then I won't have to worry about it and that'll save me the time from having to put that uh in the code anyway Brandon says should always check for no anyways can never depend on your users and a thumbs up for that yeah if I do although I was if I make it a required field then they won't actually even be able to make a new event unless they set the field so if there were to be um an error it would be either like the Google API uh stopped working like maybe I hit my limit on on that or something so actually um it there could be there could be an instance where maybe um something happened with the Google API messing up so uh so I will do that um let me add this all right so Patrick's saying add uh infinity what how do I add how do how do I make something Infinity this is another one of those questions that I'm just like I probably should know this uh I'm sure this is one of those um like questions in uh JavaScript Basics that I just don't know because cuz I always jumped around when learning things to just learn whatever I needed for the project that I was doing and uh I have gaps in my education math Infinity okay cool thank you that makes sense and I mean honestly I probably sorry I even asked that I definitely could have looked that up so um oh you don't even need math so you could uh so so I can just do Infinity then that's really cool all right so yeah actually that's legit check this out in uh the console so infinity is infinity awesome uh so sweet so that should work cool that's cool I learned so many new things new and useful things today uh so I am going to make sure I commit this and push it to the get repo cuz if I need to or want to work on this on vacation I'll definitely need it in the repo uh because I can't take my iMac with me all right so just want to make sure it's I I probably don't need to do this but I always type get status like almost always just to make sure that I didn't accidentally um edit any other files uh without realizing it so and try like what did it's been so long we've been working on this so I want to make sure I remember what we did our last commit was um what was that we didn't have a last commit did we okay get user location I thought we did so we have get user location uh so now it's going to be um all right that works that pretty much sums up what we did it's crazy that all that work summed up in such a short commit message but I still feel good that we did it and by we I mean mostly you and I did the typing whoa what errors figures it figures I thought I was done and now I have errors uh where's my error irregular white space seriously irregular white space well at least it tells me exactly where so JS 56 so is it because it's because of this stuff what is this white where is my irregular white space I don't even know does anybody know what what the heck it's doing to me for regular irregular white space um all right let me see let me check the live chat um you all don't have to watch me uh figure out these errors because this is not like major errors everything works it's just I have some weird white space somewhere that I have to find um let me check really quick in the chat uh I'm probably not going to go through the whole chat this time to answer questions for two reasons one I'm just I'm really tired and I need to just be done also like this stream has been so long uh there probably aren't that many people that have been here since the beginning so they might not even be around to hear the answer so I am going to save this live chat and then read through it later on and um and try to answer that maybe in a future in a future live stream or put it in the comments for this video or something like that all right so Andre has a quick question which setting did you use in order to be able to use the spread operator on objects when I use it in Chrome Dev tools it does not work um let's see okay Patrick Patrick gave the answer that I was going to give uh yeah so all my all the Babel transpiling stuff that I'm doing right now is building an xjs I haven't uh I haven't done anything with that so I'm not sure exactly what they have going on it probably says in their documentation uh so I'm assuming that they are allowing you know they're they're transpiling pretty much you know The Cutting Edge uh since I I've never used anything that hasn't worked uh in terms of newer JavaScript stuff so whatever whatever um flavor of bble they're using uh is covers most most things at least everything I've tried um let's see oh okay I copy and pasted okay sha thank you so much um so I copy EV I copied and pasted this line from the chat which I need to just quit that because it keeps messing me up so maybe maybe that'll solve it let's see shoot it's happening again uh but actually I I didn't think about this before but it is telling me it's line what is it line 56 40 so where am I 40 whoa oh man that's weird do you guys see that so I can click here this is really weird so I I'm going to click three times and watch what happens I click three times one two three between that second and third click it doesn't move so that's definitely it and hopefully this isn't okay looks like that one works that is so weird I've I've never seen that there we go and that worked awesome sweet okay so all everything we just did is now up in the repo on GitHub under the geolocation Branch so uh you can check it out if you want to um all right so thank you to everyone this was insanely a long stream and uh thanks everybody who stuck around what was this like a 4our
