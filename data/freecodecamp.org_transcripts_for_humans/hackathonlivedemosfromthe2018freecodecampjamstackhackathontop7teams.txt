00:00 - [Music]
00:13 - hey everyone
00:14 - welcome
00:15 - to the top six
00:18 - i'm quincy larson with free code camp
00:20 - i am joined by matt billman
00:23 - ceo and co-founder of netlify
00:27 - cole crumport
00:29 - the
00:30 - ceo and co-founder of formsfree
00:34 - and chris anderson
00:36 - the lead developer evangelist
00:39 - for
00:42 - verfana
00:43 - the database
00:45 - so today
00:47 - we are going to be
00:49 - talking with a lot
00:51 - actually seven i said
00:53 - top six but actually we decided to
00:55 - extend it to a seventh one because we
00:56 - were so pulled over by the quality of
00:58 - the submissions we're going to be
01:00 - talking with seven teams
01:02 - of hackathon participants
01:04 - many of whom did not know one another
01:07 - 36 hours ago
01:09 - came together and built some amazing
01:11 - stuff and we're going to see that
01:12 - amazing stuff and we're going to get to
01:14 - the bottom of how they built it and who
01:16 - they are
01:17 - so first we're going to start with
01:20 - caption this
01:21 - and
01:22 - gentlemen perhaps we can start with you
01:24 - just a quick introduction who you are
01:27 - where you're from what you do
01:29 - my name is vijay i'm from new hampshire
01:32 - and
01:33 - i actually am a technician
01:36 - i work for ge aviation so as a
01:39 - technician
01:40 - and i just graduated from
01:42 - the
01:43 - granite state college
01:46 - so
01:47 - yeah that's what i do and i love coding
01:49 - great thank you vijay welcome and uh
01:51 - congratulations
01:53 - on recent
01:54 - graduations thank you great to see you
01:56 - i'm uh david carter um
01:59 - i just moved to san francisco in july
02:01 - and um originally from the antelope
02:04 - valley palmdale lancaster
02:06 - and um
02:07 - right now i work at a wordpress agency
02:10 - and so i'm looking to get more into
02:11 - reaction the jam stack great are you a
02:13 - broncos fan i am a drone
02:16 - how did you guess that
02:19 - hi my name is sumit i'm a qa engineer
02:21 - and i live in sunnyvale california
02:24 - i actually started learning front-end
02:26 - development at free code camp so this is
02:28 - a big day for me
02:31 - and yeah i'm continuing to learn more of
02:34 - front-end like react and other
02:36 - free bugs so yeah i'm really excited
02:39 - thank you so much well
02:41 - perhaps you could go ahead and give us a
02:43 - very quick demonstration of how caption
02:46 - this works
02:47 - all right so caption this is basically
02:49 - going to present you with a random gif
02:51 - so every time you load the page
02:54 - it's going to get a random gif
02:58 - so if you don't like it you can always
02:59 - press this next button
03:03 - and you can choose better gifts
03:11 - and see so you could enter in any
03:13 - caption you want
03:16 - submit it
03:17 - and it's going to add it to our list of
03:19 - submitted gifts
03:21 - and every user could whether or not you
03:24 - submit a gif
03:25 - you can um up vote
03:27 - and we're going to rank all these
03:29 - submissions by votes
03:31 - so the most popular will always be at
03:33 - the top
03:34 - and we've added authentication with
03:37 - netlify
03:56 - right on you've got some pretty cool
03:58 - gifts here too and very good captions
04:01 - for someone what's your favorite so far
04:02 - that you've what what what caption are
04:05 - you most proud of so far
04:06 - um
04:08 - it got deleted actually
04:11 - it got deleted when we added our
04:19 - where do you get the gifts from uh it's
04:22 - uh the api is called the api is called
04:24 - jiffy
04:25 - so yeah that's where you're getting the
04:27 - apps from so where do you stand on the
04:29 - gif versus gif pronunciation
04:32 - everybody who pronounces it gif say
04:35 - ready
04:36 - set
04:39 - everybody who pronounces it jiff
04:41 - say woo
04:43 - actually i like to call it gif so that
04:46 - is
04:47 - a true diplomat
04:50 - great
04:51 - well
04:52 - judges
04:54 - what do you all think so far
04:58 - it's great i really love this one um i
05:00 - think it's fun i think it's kind of a
05:02 - cool i like that you can upvote it and
05:04 - then everyone can see that
05:05 - um so it's it's participatory it's kind
05:07 - of uh
05:08 - it's cool
05:11 - it's a good scope a lot of times hack
05:14 - apps will overscope or underscope and
05:16 - it's hard to be impressive like that but
05:18 - it's impressive to bring it mostly to
05:21 - completion
05:22 - because you picked the right scope
05:24 - yeah
05:26 - yeah i would certainly
05:28 - uh share that opinion i've seen so many
05:30 - hackathon projects that are extremely
05:32 - ambitious and then they have to pair
05:34 - back all their
05:35 - ambitions right before the demo time but
05:38 - it looks like this is something that
05:40 - was
05:40 - definitely doable within the time frame
05:43 - and
05:44 - yeah and you all executed great did you
05:46 - have any sort of top things you would
05:48 - have liked to do that there wasn't time
05:50 - from that you had to scope back from or
05:54 - there is a um we wanted to tie
05:57 - voting to user authentication right now
05:59 - we're just storing that with local
06:01 - storage so tying that into the user
06:03 - would have been
06:05 - i think it was nice
06:05 - little good story it's just smart sort
06:07 - of
06:08 - gradual way of getting there
06:10 - you imagine you'll keep hacking on it
06:13 - um
06:15 - maybe
06:17 - i'm into it yeah i'm thinking about it
06:20 - right on and uh what kind of
06:23 - collaborative filtering
06:24 - method are you thinking about are you
06:26 - thinking about like a
06:28 - like
06:29 - reddit or hacker news or some of those
06:31 - other collaborative filtering algorithms
06:33 - and or how are you planning for things
06:35 - to gradually decay and fall off of the
06:38 - top we haven't thought of that actually
06:41 - yeah yeah maybe something like that
06:43 - well i mean there are plenty of models i
06:45 - just wanted to see if you all were
06:46 - thinking about it because you don't want
06:48 - the top loaded thing to always be on the
06:49 - top because it'll you know when it takes
06:51 - off
06:52 - should be fresh stuff
06:55 - yeah we should have some tabs on there
06:56 - so recent ones or pop most popular tabs
07:00 - that
07:01 - you can work on those
07:03 - how did you split up the work between
07:05 - you
07:07 - so he
07:08 - vijay did all the styling stuff yeah all
07:12 - the css and
07:14 - he did all the javascript part
07:16 - and i was
07:18 - there for like adding features sometimes
07:20 - and also for like running around and
07:23 - like we have problems with fauna tv or
07:25 - forms free which we had
07:28 - so talking to those two guys about how
07:30 - do we like go forward uh what should we
07:32 - do and all those things yeah we had
07:35 - great help so we'd like to thank all the
07:37 - judges and help us there during the
07:40 - hackathon process it was really great
07:42 - without them we couldn't even complete
07:44 - this for sure right
07:48 - what have you learned from this
07:50 - hackathon that you didn't know at the
07:52 - beginning about yourself
07:57 - uh for me like uh i was
07:59 - you know as i said i was um
08:02 - coding in a free code camp online thing
08:05 - so i had i never worked as a as a team i
08:09 - never quoted as team so it's
08:11 - really a different experience i believe
08:14 - and i really learned a lot of stuffs and
08:17 - how team
08:18 - you know
08:20 - goes up so i really
08:23 - learned a lot about the teaming thing
08:26 - first the first most thing
08:28 - and about the you know reading
08:30 - documentations that those things were
08:33 - very important and because the apis we
08:36 - used here and the
08:38 - databases we use they were completely
08:40 - new for us
08:41 - but
08:42 - uh you know
08:44 - the the judges they showed us where to
08:47 - go for the technical documentation so we
08:50 - just rate that and i think because of
08:52 - that so yeah we learned a lot actually
08:58 - probably the collaboration skills
09:00 - working with people in different skill
09:02 - sets and learning to divide the work so
09:04 - everyone works to their advantages
09:07 - we didn't know each other before these
09:09 - hackathons until yesterday we didn't
09:11 - know each other i'm from new hampshire
09:14 - all the way from new hampshire
09:15 - and yeah so we just made a team and boom
09:20 - are there other apps you almost built
09:24 - uh no we didn't even have an idea for
09:26 - this is gonna spur at the moment
09:30 - at what point did you start
09:32 - shift from like idea and
09:33 - conceptualization and
09:35 - building your team like at what hour of
09:37 - yesterday would you say you actually sat
09:39 - down and started
09:41 - coding
09:42 - probably after lunch
09:45 - yeah
09:46 - just after my chest
09:49 - right
09:51 - any other questions
09:53 - what was the hardest thing you had to
09:56 - solve while building this
10:01 - the login
10:02 - um because we just had limited time the
10:04 - last hour yeah and then
10:07 - incrementing the votes yeah incrementing
10:08 - the votes
10:10 - learning how to like we had to read and
10:12 - write and yeah yeah talk to hona devi
10:14 - like how would you do god
10:16 - yeah well great thank you so much for
10:20 - coming up here and for demoing
10:22 - pleasure meeting you through gentlemen
10:23 - and i'm very impressed with what you've
10:25 - done here yeah
10:27 - great girl thank you thank you
10:32 - nice to meet you
10:58 - just let me know when the audio is back
11:00 - it's back okay great yeah so while wall
11:02 - hacks piece coming up here go ahead and
11:04 - get situated i just want to take a
11:06 - moment to uh recognize
11:09 - some of you are going to need to stand
11:11 - be careful that white stuff and it's not
11:13 - like a skate park
11:20 - all right so i just want to take a
11:21 - moment to acknowledge
11:23 - uh
11:24 - one of the biggest sponsors of the event
11:27 - i guess uh maybe the biggest adventure
11:30 - but
11:31 - netlify
11:32 - is such a an amazing supporter of the
11:35 - developer community and they're really
11:37 - pushing forward with a lot of
11:39 - technology that's going to make the
11:40 - internet faster and safer
11:43 - and make it easier for organizations to
11:45 - scale their website so matt billman
11:48 - from netlify is a visionary
11:50 - and
11:51 - i'm very excited personally to see
11:54 - where
11:55 - where he goes and where netlify goes in
11:57 - the coming years so thanks again for
11:59 - your support thanks thanks for having me
12:02 - here and thanks for helping bring all of
12:04 - this on and driving it forward and for
12:06 - building free code camp i think
12:08 - everything we do is about helping
12:10 - developers build things so
12:12 - being at a place and seeing hundreds of
12:14 - developers building things with our
12:16 - thing is really exciting
12:18 - and on the note of people building
12:20 - things using netlify let's talk to haxby
12:24 - how are you
12:25 - great yeah yeah you're doing great yeah
12:27 - well i hope we started starting with
12:28 - this gentleman we'll just go
12:30 - uh i guess in clockwise order yeah we'll
12:33 - do it clockwise we're gonna go like this
12:35 - why not we got we've got two dimensions
12:38 - here yeah
12:40 - uh and just tell us your name where
12:42 - you're from and what what you're doing
12:44 - with your time these days all right well
12:46 - my name is robert wolf i'm
12:48 - originally from europe but i'm taking my
12:50 - extra semester here studying ux design
12:52 - but i also like the code and when i
12:54 - discovered jamstag about a year ago i
12:56 - saw
12:57 - one of the three first keynotes i was so
12:59 - excited was like telling all my friends
13:01 - stop doing what you're doing start doing
13:03 - the new way and i'm so happy to be here
13:05 - today where it actually kind of have
13:07 - grown and i feel like there's a lot of
13:08 - people around doing the same thing
13:11 - great
13:12 - yeah hi i'm anil i am working a software
13:14 - developer here in bay area and i have
13:16 - i'm really excited about the react stuff
13:18 - and all then i got to know about the
13:20 - gatsby stuff and i have built some kind
13:22 - of local projects with me and
13:25 - then i got to know more about the jam
13:27 - stack and it was really exciting so i
13:29 - want to know who out there is working on
13:31 - that and i got to know about this
13:32 - hackathon it's pretty good environment
13:35 - out here yeah
13:36 - hold on
13:38 - so my name is kyle smith and i'm a
13:40 - student at csu stanislaus a computer
13:42 - science student
13:43 - and uh
13:45 - yeah just started learning about web
13:46 - technologies when i was in high school
13:48 - and found out about jam stack about like
13:51 - a few months ago and it was just so easy
13:53 - to grasp
13:54 - and just been interested ever since
13:57 - great
13:59 - my name is manuel and i'm a computer
14:01 - science student in cabrillo based in
14:04 - santa cruz
14:05 - and honestly i don't remember how i came
14:07 - across free code camp but i came across
14:09 - it thankfully
14:11 - and i've been programming ever since
14:15 - great
14:16 - i'm ryan weimer i live here in oakland
14:18 - in the bay area i actually work as a
14:20 - project slash account manager so i like
14:23 - these kind of opportunities because i've
14:25 - never done a hackathon before but i
14:26 - thought it would be awesome to get my
14:27 - hands dirty in the code and i really
14:29 - like the jam stack i've built a number
14:31 - of you know personal websites with it
14:33 - and it's such a contrast from like the
14:35 - monolithic things that i'm used to
14:37 - in the enterprise world you know doing
14:39 - it for a big client it's really
14:40 - refreshing to do something like this for
14:41 - the jam stack
14:44 - yeah well uh ryan it looks like you're
14:46 - at the helm yeah let me know if we can
14:48 - uh get this display
14:50 - so
14:51 - is it plugged in it is plugged you have
14:53 - to unplug it and plug it in again okay
14:55 - that's how they fixed the hubble the
14:57 - other day classical
15:00 - yeah
15:02 - hdmi intel oh into the back of the usb
15:04 - dongle yeah oh that would probably help
15:09 - conspicuously sitting there
15:10 - [Laughter]
15:14 - all right here we go okay this is big
15:16 - screen here we go let's make that full
15:18 - screen
15:19 - nice awesome
15:21 - so robert as you already know our name
15:23 - is haxby we're on the hackathon using
15:25 - gatsby um this is the problem we're
15:27 - selling if you ever learn the language
15:29 - with a language app you know it's a
15:30 - terribly boring and kind of weird
15:32 - process usually let's stare at the
15:33 - pictures of people you've never seen
15:35 - before and try to attach your basic
15:37 - vocabulary to the pictures it doesn't
15:39 - really work i've tried to learn a
15:41 - language with many different apps i've
15:43 - never succeeded so
15:45 - when we
15:46 - came here together in the hackathon we
15:48 - thought we're gonna make something
15:49 - better we're gonna approach learning a
15:51 - language differently
15:52 - and what we realized is that
15:55 - it's all about you right
15:57 - what makes the learning language easier
15:59 - if is if you can relate if your brain
16:02 - can associate things with it so we
16:04 - wanted to make something relatable and
16:05 - also fun and that's why we created
16:08 - u-lingual now
16:10 - what u-lingual does is it takes your
16:12 - instagram images
16:14 - and
16:16 - teaches you new vocab based on them now
16:18 - this is how our app works so at first we
16:21 - authorized instagram then we take the
16:24 - pictures from the instagram and in real
16:26 - time we pass them through the clarified
16:27 - data to get image recognitions and get
16:30 - an idea about what is it in there now
16:32 - clarify api returns this word the tags
16:36 - of the images in different languages so
16:37 - we pull it out in a different language
16:40 - of the user that he selected and we play
16:42 - a quiz with them that's how we teach
16:44 - them the words
16:47 - now this is how the quiz looks like
16:49 - so you have the word frutto that's for
16:51 - example fruit and italian and you have
16:53 - four pictures from your instagram feed
16:56 - this is my own fear it's embarrassing
17:00 - and you have to select the one that it
17:02 - is
17:03 - and thanks to clarify api being
17:05 - available in 23 different languages we
17:07 - can
17:08 - offer this product in 23 languages very
17:10 - easily so that's exciting
17:13 - now we're going to show you a quick demo
17:15 - about how it actually works
17:18 - all right that's bigger
17:21 - all right so this is the demo that we
17:22 - had showed before so this is
17:25 - a little bit more limited in terms of we
17:26 - wanted to show
17:28 - spanish specifically and again with
17:29 - robert but just to kind of give you an
17:31 - idea
17:32 - and some of these words you know there's
17:34 - obviously room for improvement masculino
17:36 - masculinity could be a lot of these
17:38 - right okay time ran out so that was an
17:39 - example
17:43 - yeah select great one we have a response
17:45 - for a good job
17:46 - beach if i select the wrong one oh sorry
17:49 - incorrect and we're also totaling your
17:51 - score so we kind of have some logic
17:52 - involved with that fruto an example
17:56 - and then basically we give you a score
17:58 - that we total and we give you an ability
18:00 - to tweet out your results um you know i
18:03 - did great on
18:04 - you know my my test in spanish with my
18:07 - own selfies or something yeah we kind of
18:08 - leave it up to the user and how they
18:10 - want to promote it but that's kind of
18:11 - our way of cross-promoting it
18:13 - another
18:14 - cool idea we thought was like this is
18:16 - such a new thing and there's probably
18:18 - all sorts of bugs and ways to improve it
18:20 - we want to give an ability to add some
18:21 - feedback right so using formspree we're
18:23 - able to simply you know add a way to
18:26 - give your name email what's your
18:27 - feedback how can we make our app better
18:29 - so you can send it
18:30 - and
18:32 - and actually send it
18:34 - that's what some dummy data obviously
18:35 - but yeah you get the idea right fork
18:37 - stream makes it really easy um and
18:39 - something that we're really excited
18:40 - about is that's what we were showing
18:42 - before and already we were already kind
18:44 - of hacking away even in the short time
18:45 - we had like let's add some more
18:47 - languages right so we're already doing
18:49 - that let's add german
18:51 - um so
18:52 - we're already working on making that
18:54 - improved so it's just cool that we could
18:57 - do so much more with it
18:59 - so that's an example of german instead
19:01 - of spanish and with my instagram feed
19:04 - there you go very cool
19:06 - so you were able to get instagram
19:08 - integrated or did you see the data so
19:11 - that was the biggest challenge we had
19:13 - we had to say that our api experts can
19:15 - talk about this
19:17 - initially when we thought about the
19:19 - instagram thing right we thought the
19:20 - privacy process will be there and all
19:21 - and we couldn't get the data and all so
19:23 - then we figured out that there is a uh
19:25 - api there out there but
19:28 - the only constraint we faced is that
19:29 - there's a sandbox api which allows only
19:31 - 10 users initially and each user will
19:33 - have only 20 pictures from their feed so
19:36 - that's how we are developing right now
19:37 - but when we have a full-fledged app we
19:39 - can
19:40 - send for the instagram uh access so that
19:43 - uh it can be expanded to an n number of
19:45 - users so that's what we are working on
19:47 - yeah so
19:48 - that's one kind of problem we faced here
19:54 - well the product looks great you've done
19:56 - a good job of just keeping the number of
19:58 - elements to an absolute minimum
20:01 - and it's colorful and big elements
20:04 - so i definitely
20:06 - uh commend your design sensibilities
20:09 - which of you
20:10 - yeah
20:12 - robert and i collaborated this great
20:14 - kind of like pair programming split into
20:16 - the api group and front end it was
20:18 - awesome actually that's worked out
20:19 - pretty great actually the api group and
20:21 - the front-end group so that the task can
20:23 - be divided easily yeah and
20:25 - the integration had some hiccups but
20:27 - yeah
20:28 - yeah
20:29 - it's pretty good
20:31 - what was the planning like did you sit
20:33 - down and think about i mean how did you
20:35 - how did you choose the problem to solve
20:37 - and then how did you set about choosing
20:39 - instagram and machine learning to solve
20:41 - it well so we actually gathered on
20:44 - friday on a discord chat
20:46 - so we didn't have any idea and we
20:48 - started deciding on saturday morning
20:50 - um we were very fascinated with the
20:52 - clarify api we thought well this is such
20:54 - a powerful thing we can do so many
20:55 - things with it at first we thought about
20:57 - helping visually impaired people
20:59 - and then we had this uh idea of
21:02 - languages and it just seemed like a
21:04 - chiffon concept and a lot of things to
21:06 - do with that and by noon we know this is
21:09 - what we're going with
21:12 - how did you select sort of the scope for
21:15 - the app and and where there's some
21:17 - things you felt like ah we really wanted
21:18 - those in but you cut them out
21:21 - actually when we first thought about the
21:23 - app right we thought like many of the
21:24 - kids apps are like this like
21:27 - suppose when you go to school right
21:28 - you'll learn about a fruit or something
21:30 - by seeing to that and you learn the
21:31 - language like that but
21:33 - when we thought about instagram it came
21:35 - out out of the blue and uh then we got
21:37 - in about adults as well and new language
21:39 - as well and that's how yeah we thought
21:41 - this would be more personal to the
21:43 - user rather than using some random
21:45 - images so that's how it came up exactly
21:47 - using instagram was kind of the key idea
21:49 - that makes us excited because everyone
21:51 - loves themselves they love their own
21:52 - pictures they're just gonna be addicted
21:54 - to this game as we are we stop
21:56 - developing and start playing
21:59 - we definitely ran into items with scope
22:01 - right thinking about like project
22:03 - management right you know we ran into
22:04 - lots of cool features that we wanted to
22:06 - so we actually had a whiteboard and
22:07 - wrote down lists like these are problems
22:09 - these are some kind of features and we
22:11 - tried to address the problems before the
22:13 - future features we wanted to add sound
22:15 - that'd be really cool but that's
22:16 - probably lower priority than some of
22:17 - these other ones
22:19 - so it's good to work on it in that way
22:21 - are you all concerned that at some point
22:24 - after playing the game a little bit that
22:26 - you're going to kind of be seeing the
22:27 - same images i mean i have a uh somewhat
22:30 - active instagram feed but probably not
22:32 - more than like
22:33 - maybe like 50 images in there and i can
22:35 - imagine that
22:36 - i won't be able to learn all german
22:40 - actually to be frank unfortunately the
22:42 - instagram is not allowing other public
22:44 - uh users images to be seen so that's one
22:47 - kind of privacy policy they have but
22:48 - other thing is that it can i think it
22:51 - has an endpoint where we can get the
22:53 - data from a specific location by giving
22:55 - gratitude longitude so that might work
22:57 - so that's kind of one of the
22:58 - enhancements we thought about further
23:00 - yeah so you can't like get images from
23:02 - friends or anything exactly
23:04 - unfortunately due to privacy issues this
23:06 - would have been much easier three years
23:07 - ago
23:08 - but it's a little bit more difficult now
23:10 - on the other hand clarify gives us a
23:12 - list of 20 words per image so we could
23:15 - basically if you have three images you
23:17 - can still learn 60
23:21 - a good words is that extensible can you
23:23 - add like can you teach clarify more
23:26 - more terms and stuff so right now we're
23:28 - just using their general model we
23:29 - haven't really explored in there i hope
23:31 - we could maybe develop our own model
23:32 - based on instagram pictures a lot of
23:34 - food a lot of selfies right
23:38 - yeah that's a good point have you
23:39 - considered maybe uh expanding the
23:42 - functionality by encouraging people to
23:44 - take more photos on instagram and
23:45 - graduate hey maybe you should take a
23:47 - picture of fruit
24:02 - yeah it could also teach you to be a
24:04 - good photographer that way yeah yeah
24:07 - photography projects and language
24:08 - projects yeah all sorts of applications
24:11 - yeah one more thing that's important say
24:14 - for us it's important it's a website not
24:15 - an app because this is something people
24:17 - will go and try out really quickly and
24:19 - that's where the power of gemstock is
24:20 - coming so it
24:22 - opens up instantly and with one click
24:24 - you can start and play yeah we also will
24:27 - save data in the local storage so when
24:29 - the
24:30 - user wizards again they will have their
24:34 - app already open
24:36 - yeah
24:37 - is it mobile friendly is this thing
24:40 - yeah i mean because the design is pretty
24:42 - basic we didn't have to do too much
24:48 - let's see
24:50 - on the quiz itself
24:52 - let's go back to this we did make it
24:55 - somewhat
24:56 - mobile friendly
24:57 - as much as we can you know with a simple
24:58 - design no that's good
25:01 - have you considered talking to language
25:03 - teachers to get feedback on how this
25:05 - could be used how this could be improved
25:08 - so none of us is actually
25:12 - we didn't have personal experience
25:13 - because robert has learned english and
25:15 - other languages so that was good but i'm
25:17 - sure other experts would be helpful yeah
25:20 - well is this something you all are
25:21 - considering pursuing beyond the
25:23 - hackathon
25:24 - i think so yeah yeah it could be fun
25:26 - we came
25:30 - it needs push notifications to remind me
25:31 - it's time to study yeah that's right
25:36 - and to remind you to take the instagram
25:38 - photos of this
25:45 - and when you go to your next country you
25:46 - can talk to your friends in different
25:48 - languages about your instagram feed
25:55 - yeah well i i would encourage you to
25:57 - continue pursuing it i'm not like
26:00 - an expert in human psychology or
26:02 - anything but the vanity angle and the
26:03 - way that the brain works and stuff it
26:06 - may actually be more compelling and form
26:08 - stronger relations
26:09 - if it's something personally related to
26:11 - you that you're associating that word
26:13 - with so
26:14 - um thank you
26:15 - gentlemen for coming in thanks for
26:17 - building this excellent uh application
26:19 - in such a short time it's very
26:20 - impressive and uh yeah we'll we'll look
26:24 - forward to
26:25 - um hearing more about what you do in the
26:28 - coming months and if if you do continue
26:30 - working on this let us know because we'd
26:32 - like to see how it comes along and maybe
26:34 - to go
26:36 - catch up and
26:37 - do a retrospective on it yeah awesome
26:40 - all right thank you thank you thank you
26:41 - for the support here everyone
26:44 - thank you
26:48 - thank you
26:49 - yeah nice meeting you great work
26:55 - all right and
26:57 - next
26:58 - team who's going to come in
27:01 - is going to be
27:03 - make squad
27:05 - i'm very excited about my squad
27:07 - i'm also
27:08 - very excited
27:10 - about
27:13 - what you're doing is
27:22 - thank you so much cole
27:24 - cole again uh ceo and co-founder of
27:27 - performance free cold chromhold
27:30 - and uh thanks for all the guidance
27:32 - you've
27:32 - provided to the many participants here
27:35 - you have truly created a
27:38 - a great developer experience as far as
27:41 - installing forms and
27:43 - forms are a big deal and
27:45 - pretty much every developer has to deal
27:46 - with forms and
27:48 - i'm really excited to hear that you're
27:49 - so rapidly expanding
27:51 - and you've got the api
27:55 - sounds like development is
27:57 - coming along swimming over there
27:59 - the team
28:00 - who couldn't make it here they were
28:02 - working really hard uh up up until like
28:05 - pretty much the last minute and
28:07 - yeah it was great um we got a lot of
28:08 - good stuff done at the end including an
28:10 - entire redesign of the site
28:12 - which uh yeah
28:14 - it was a great forcing function for us
28:16 - to get a lot of stuff done i think now
28:18 - we're going to probably do some cleanup
28:21 - all right well good luck paying down the
28:22 - technical debt
28:24 - here we are with our next very exciting
28:27 - team uh
28:29 - first of all
28:30 - before we get started i just want to say
28:32 - that this was
28:33 - incredibly well presented
28:36 - i think all of us agreed that your
28:38 - delivery was phenomenal
28:40 - so we're looking forward to hearing a
28:42 - little bit more of that donut delivery
28:43 - here
28:45 - but uh make squad let's start let's
28:47 - start with you faith and perhaps you can
28:49 - introduce yourself and then we can kind
28:51 - of go around and clockwise and uh
28:53 - introduce everybody else yeah definitely
28:55 - um so
28:56 - i'm faith um and um i'm a student at
29:00 - make school so hence the name make squad
29:03 - um and yeah so um
29:07 - we have some other people here on the
29:08 - team as well yeah well before before we
29:11 - do uh if you could just tell us like
29:13 - where you're from and aside from being a
29:15 - student at make school like just a
29:17 - little bit about your background sure um
29:19 - so i'm from atlanta um i moved out to
29:21 - san francisco to attend mcschool um
29:24 - right now i'm working on back-end web
29:27 - development as my primary concentration
29:30 - um but i was interested in this
29:32 - hackathon because uh the opportunity to
29:34 - work kind of more in the front end and
29:36 - exercise that skill a little bit
29:39 - and i was excited by all of the apis um
29:41 - and i also have an interest in things
29:44 - that have to do with machine learning um
29:46 - and we did employ a little bit of the
29:48 - clarify api in here so that was really
29:50 - fun to work with and to see how that
29:52 - works yeah awesome and tachara yes i'm
29:55 - tashara boucher and i'm from southern
29:57 - california i've been in san francisco
30:00 - for about two years and i came here to
30:02 - do
30:04 - to be a chaplain in the hospital
30:06 - but after my residency year i i guess
30:09 - um wanted to
30:11 - do like a combination of both but tech
30:13 - and the social services so my ultimate
30:15 - goal is to try to have a non-profit for
30:17 - young adults who've been mentally or
30:19 - physically abused in childhood and to
30:21 - help them with the trade like so the
30:23 - coding and to be able to like put um
30:26 - so that they can have a better lifestyle
30:28 - after
30:29 - having a slump i guess for the years um
30:32 - and so this hackathon is a great
30:34 - experience for me to get experience to
30:36 - network with different people and to
30:38 - meet these wonderful people who are from
30:40 - make school and
30:42 - graciously welcomed me into their team
30:46 - i'm excited
30:47 - awesome
30:49 - i'm edwin and i'm from uh georgia also
30:52 - in make school and i
30:54 - moved here about four months ago
30:56 - um
30:58 - and
31:00 - well
31:03 - i i i worked with coding off and on for
31:06 - like the last 10 years but
31:08 - nothing really serious until i i moved
31:10 - here
31:11 - um but it's always been a passion of
31:13 - mine and i had a lot of fun at this
31:15 - hackathon learning these new
31:16 - technologies great
31:19 - oh i'm jonathan and i'm a full stock
31:21 - developer at make school and i'm from
31:23 - houston texas awesome
31:26 - okay hi i'm stephanie um i'm a junior in
31:28 - med school so i just started a couple
31:30 - months ago in august and i'm from miami
31:33 - i just learned about the opportunity um
31:35 - um i've done also free co-op camp like a
31:37 - couple of people here as well and it was
31:40 - great i've also done one hackathon
31:42 - before and it was it was great it was
31:44 - stressful too but there were
31:46 - the end product was great was lovely i i
31:49 - love building products
31:50 - yeah and since you all are from high
31:52 - school perhaps just a quick word about
31:55 - make school because it is a new
31:57 - educational model yeah
31:59 - so it's a new education model um and it
32:02 - is um
32:03 - product uh based learning um so
32:06 - basically instead of attending a lot of
32:08 - long boring lectures and writing stuff
32:10 - on the whiteboard for hours and kind of
32:12 - getting an entrenched in the theory of
32:14 - it we build products throughout the term
32:17 - you build a product at the end of every
32:19 - term we have like our own mini hackathon
32:21 - it's an intensive where you build a
32:23 - product in a week
32:24 - we work on teams we work individually so
32:27 - throughout the time that you attend the
32:28 - program you're building up a portfolio
32:31 - um and so that's why a lot of us were
32:33 - interested in doing this hackathon
32:35 - because we wanted to have another
32:37 - opportunity to build something to
32:39 - yeah to ship it get our idea out there
32:43 - yeah and how long is the program
32:45 - mixed school is two years um and it is a
32:48 - bachelor's program so it's an
32:49 - accelerated bachelor's
32:51 - we have some people who attend for about
32:52 - a year and then they get hired out of
32:54 - the program but it's a two year long
32:56 - program great so at the end of the
32:58 - program you all have a bachelor's degree
33:00 - yeah
33:02 - now it's pretty remarkable
33:04 - so if you're looking for novel
33:07 - higher education models it sounds like
33:09 - this might be worth investigating
33:11 - so um without further ado let's let's
33:14 - jump to the demo you ready yes let's do
33:16 - it
33:17 - yeah so um our app is called network
33:21 - you can leave your business card at home
33:23 - because your face is your business card
33:26 - and so
33:27 - we thought a lot about you know what it
33:29 - feels like sometimes when you're at
33:30 - these networking events especially
33:32 - because the world is full of a lot of
33:34 - emerging technologies
33:36 - sometimes you forget those business
33:37 - cards or it's clunky to kind of like you
33:39 - know waffle with those um and so our
33:42 - idea was to build an app where you can
33:44 - simply take a photo of somebody or you
33:46 - can take a video of them
33:48 - and you can use that video or that photo
33:50 - to retrieve their virtual business card
33:53 - to get back their information
33:55 - so we built kind of a minimum viable
33:57 - product here that demonstrates that idea
33:59 - and we're hoping to have a chance to
34:01 - develop it further in the future but for
34:03 - now we do
34:05 - want to start with the app
34:08 - and so this is the um the business card
34:11 - info you would go ahead and fill in your
34:13 - name your email address your phone
34:15 - number um your state city and state um
34:18 - and then you can fill in your linkedin
34:21 - we would also have twitter which would
34:22 - be an optional field and then another
34:24 - field where you could fill in uh
34:26 - additional information
34:28 - and then you could submit that but
34:30 - before we go to the submission page we
34:32 - also connected a contact form here
34:35 - so for people who for people who have
34:37 - questions for people who have id uh you
34:39 - know ideas for new features or for
34:41 - people who have problems using the app
34:42 - they can um ping us we used forms free
34:45 - to connect the contact form and this
34:48 - form actually does work it does submit
34:50 - and we get the email from that so we
34:51 - could get updated information there yeah
34:53 - you can go ahead and submit it if you
34:55 - want to
35:04 - and then
35:04 - of course we have to put it that we're
35:06 - not a robot
35:08 - i'm not a room full of robots
35:11 - i don't like y'all but i'm kind of a
35:12 - robot
35:14 - just a little bit just a little bit
35:16 - so that went through a couple of
35:18 - submissions from this ip address over
35:20 - there yeah
35:22 - um
35:23 - and then for um
35:25 - you can go ahead and yeah there you go
35:28 - so we got two sides or two ways to um to
35:31 - go ahead and check check out the
35:33 - database you can go to camera
35:35 - um first and you want to go to video
35:37 - first camera okay
35:42 - um and so then you just select the image
35:44 - um so
35:47 - for now we're using the celebrity um
35:50 - model of the api um because it was
35:52 - already hooked up to like a trading
35:54 - model but ideally we would be able to
35:56 - use user photos in the future
35:59 - and
36:00 - it goes to the database we used fauna db
36:03 - for the database
36:05 - and we used clarify for the api that's
36:08 - the celebrity model that we're using
36:09 - here
36:10 - and then it would bring back the
36:12 - person's information we have leonardo
36:13 - dicaprio
36:15 - and we got kanye
36:19 - as our tests
36:21 - great and earlier you you were able to
36:23 - use a phone to demo this could you do
36:25 - that just to show that the image
36:27 - recognition
36:28 - will work from like a another device and
36:31 - then our third celebrity
36:35 - all
36:38 - right do it again
36:42 - one more time
36:45 - all right
36:48 - it worked the demo worked
36:54 - and so there's our app
36:57 - yeah
36:58 - great demo thanks for going through it
36:59 - um
37:01 - questions
37:02 - how did you know that this was the app
37:04 - you wanted to make how did you kind of
37:05 - settle into the idea
37:07 - well we're kind of talking about it
37:09 - right
37:09 - while we're coming into the building on
37:11 - the first day and we like bounce ideas
37:13 - around and we talked more about the
37:15 - ideas once we got in and then decided
37:17 - that this would be a good idea to
37:21 - do at this hackathon
37:23 - how at what point did you start working
37:26 - in this specific idea
37:28 - so when we first started out we um we
37:30 - had been taught that um you actually
37:33 - have to plan first before you start even
37:34 - coding so we didn't start coding until
37:36 - like the middle of the day
37:39 - and so we started with um user stories
37:42 - to try to make sure we we had the app do
37:44 - what it's supposed to do and we had we
37:45 - even used parts of github like on the
37:48 - projects page where you have a kanban
37:50 - board and you can move the um
37:52 - the the cards over once you've been it's
37:55 - been completed so i think that's a good
37:57 - way to plan so that way you can know
37:59 - whether what you're you want to do is
38:01 - actually done
38:02 - yeah and i can testify that we use
38:04 - github projects all the time
38:07 - it's very powerful isn't it satisfying
38:09 - when you can move the cards over it's
38:11 - like crossing it off your list
38:13 - yeah i like that how did y'all organize
38:16 - your work
38:17 - how did you decide like team which teams
38:19 - did that or you know front end back in
38:20 - that kind of thing okay i think we all
38:22 - played um on our streams i know that's
38:24 - like one of the first things that we ask
38:25 - is like what are you good at and we
38:27 - divided it up that way and um we had
38:29 - some very strong and beckons like she
38:31 - said um the make school focuses on back
38:34 - end but they also i guess focus on full
38:36 - stack so really wonderful front-end
38:39 - specialists right here and so just and
38:41 - really everybody just chipping in where
38:44 - you know whether they're slack given or
38:46 - if someone was struggling they moved the
38:47 - top out in any of the areas
38:51 - you all did a great job with the the
38:53 - design yeah um you know it's like you
38:56 - know pink and blue i think they're
38:58 - complimentary colors like if you look at
39:00 - like a color wheel
39:01 - and uh very minimalist design you can
39:04 - see like the little element that kind of
39:05 - flourish up there with the
39:07 - rounded raindrop shapes
39:10 - who did the design
39:12 - well
39:15 - [Laughter]
39:22 - helped me with a lot of the things just
39:24 - making sure it worked and it was
39:26 - cohesive on every single page as well so
39:28 - yeah
39:29 - um yeah we had we had some some ideas
39:32 - about what what we wanted and the way we
39:34 - wanted it to look we did want it to be
39:35 - minimalist so i'm glad you said that but
39:37 - we also wanted i i was really a fan of a
39:40 - lot of color in the background like um
39:42 - so we can market to people who are are
39:44 - networking and starting off in their
39:46 - careers
39:47 - yeah for the modern uh kind of
39:49 - professional
39:51 - yeah it definitely like looks like
39:53 - something that would get acquired by
39:54 - linkedin
40:00 - they had
40:01 - like a card app where you just like took
40:03 - a photo of the card and then it you know
40:05 - yeah
40:06 - and now you can take a picture
40:09 - on that note are you are you all
40:11 - planning to continue working on this
40:13 - after the weekend's over oh if linkedin
40:15 - buys it
40:18 - even if it doesn't take an offer
40:20 - tomorrow morning
40:23 - i think we have a great um kind of i
40:25 - said minimum viable product before and i
40:27 - think it would be good for us to
40:29 - continue development on it so that we
40:31 - can get it hooked up and get users
40:33 - actually in there to make sure that this
40:35 - is something that people would use that
40:37 - people would enjoy using yeah actually
40:39 - we haven't done any user testing so we
40:41 - don't even know if this is this could be
40:42 - good for them you know it could just be
40:44 - a product and it doesn't go anywhere so
40:46 - we have to
40:47 - check our market as well yeah that's
40:49 - very that's a
40:50 - sage observation and uh i can tell you i
40:53 - don't carry business cards and people
40:54 - often ask for them
40:56 - and i just say i don't know
40:59 - your phone i'll email you
41:02 - people being able to go
41:04 - now you'll be able to say my face is my
41:06 - business card
41:18 - all right well thank you again so much
41:20 - uh for coming in and demoing this and
41:22 - building it and it sounds like you all
41:24 - are from all over the u.s
41:26 - congratulations on converging and and
41:29 - forming a team and
41:31 - you know jiving so cohesively yeah it's
41:34 - amazing
41:34 - so yeah thanks again and uh
41:37 - we're looking forward to hearing about
41:39 - how things go at future hacking lawns as
41:41 - well thank you thank you
41:43 - all right cheers
41:44 - thanks hey
41:45 - thank you
41:47 - congratulations
41:48 - thank you

41:52 - all right thank you so much for the
41:54 - opportunity yeah
41:59 - all right
42:02 - well
42:03 - uh we're three demos in into our six or
42:06 - seven teams that we're going to talk to
42:09 - four more lifts
42:10 - and at this time
42:12 - i want to talk about chris anderson
42:16 - he is
42:17 - the director of developer evangelism
42:21 - at fauna and
42:23 - i interviewed this guy yesterday and i
42:25 - don't know that i've ever talked to
42:26 - somebody who's worked with so many
42:28 - different types of databases that still
42:30 - looks so young
42:32 - he's definitely got an encyclopedic
42:34 - knowledge of
42:36 - nosql databases and also knows a lot
42:39 - about real world implementation issues
42:42 - and
42:42 - and the trade-offs associated with
42:44 - different types of databases
42:46 - chris um thank you so much
42:49 - for
42:50 - coming here and inspiring everybody and
42:52 - sharing your knowledge and also
42:53 - uh thanks to to you and fauna for
42:56 - sponsoring this event oh yeah i really
42:58 - enjoy like the little bits of ways to
43:01 - help people get unstuck when they're
43:02 - hacking like to me that's the fun part
43:05 - yeah
43:06 - well um our next team
43:09 - is i'm gonna have to look up your name
43:12 - i'm sorry phoebe and jam yeah that's
43:15 - right all right
43:17 - so uh you all have these nice pasta
43:19 - stickers on what do you think of the
43:20 - household i forgot
43:23 - for a mascot
43:24 - i think it's nice it's got a little uh
43:26 - little character to it yeah you think
43:27 - it's the octa-cat tier
43:29 - oh it's up there i don't know we need to
43:31 - have like a you know how like
43:33 - uh i think it's like game effect he's
43:35 - has like the character
43:36 - face off
43:38 - and last year like tetris l block one
43:40 - because it's the ultimate hero it saves
43:42 - the day
43:44 - yeah so
43:45 - we should have something like that with
43:46 - mascots and put pit uh octopad versus
43:49 - hospital
43:50 - oh yeah sure absolutely
43:53 - so uh starting with you vince why don't
43:57 - you tell us a little about yourself and
43:59 - we're gonna move in a clockwise since we
44:01 - got two rows here okay yeah okay so my
44:04 - name is vince uh i'm a native san
44:06 - franciscan born and raised
44:08 - and i guess
44:09 - i don't know
44:11 - i'm an aspiring developer
44:14 - you know currently looking for work
44:16 - and uh
44:17 - yeah that's pretty much it
44:20 - hi my name is jin i like gin and tonic
44:23 - like the alcohol
44:24 - i'm also a native san franciscan like
44:26 - vince
44:27 - i'm also kind of using free code camp to
44:30 - learn and try and learn how to program i
44:32 - kind of have backgrounds as this admin
44:34 - but i want to make that leap into the
44:36 - development space and so this is my
44:38 - first hackathon and trying to learn as
44:40 - much as possible
44:42 - all right next
44:44 - my name is brandon stinson i am not a
44:46 - developer i'm currently in the air force
44:48 - i hit 13 years this month just uh trying
44:51 - to learn something new for when i get
44:52 - out so i've got a couple years left and
44:55 - i want to be a developer so i've been
44:56 - learning with free code camp and a
44:57 - couple of the resources and it's my
44:59 - first hackathon
45:00 - awesome
45:01 - yeah my name is reuben um i'm a native
45:04 - san franciscan but i moved when i was
45:05 - four
45:07 - yeah i'm not developer either i'm a
45:08 - mechanical engineer
45:10 - and then i transitioned over to
45:11 - electrical and now i'm trying to
45:12 - transition over to software
45:14 - and so yeah i used uh i still gotta
45:16 - start with free code camp so thank you
45:18 - quincy um but yeah i've just been
45:20 - working on react and it's also my first
45:23 - hackathon it's been just a ton of fun
45:25 - like getting to talk with the sponsors
45:27 - it's cool
45:29 - yeah
45:30 - and uh i'm austin
45:32 - and i yeah i got a degree in chemical
45:35 - engineering decided i wanted to switch
45:37 - to software engineering and so yeah i
45:40 - relied heavily on free codecamp for that
45:42 - and and now i work at human api which is
45:45 - a startup in san mateo and um so i have
45:48 - a open source project you don't know
45:50 - javascript exercises and run a meetup a
45:54 - react meetup in berkeley so
45:56 - wow
45:57 - prolific punch
45:59 - and uh yeah from from varied backgrounds
46:02 - although disproportionately from san
46:03 - francisco
46:06 - yeah
46:07 - from san francisco
46:08 - well tell us a little bit why don't we
46:10 - plug in so we can demo yeah so we'll be
46:12 - able to are we going to use your phone
46:14 - yeah oh there you go
46:16 - wow
46:17 - look at those hands
46:22 - we need to get you a cryogenic freak oh
46:24 - yeah or whatever they're called
46:30 - so yeah so you can go ahead and click on
46:33 - the app so it's uh sick pics
46:37 - we have this little uh
46:39 - so
46:40 - yeah what sick pics is
46:42 - is it's a game for anyone who can anyone
46:45 - can play
46:46 - um so right now so we have this create a
46:48 - game button where you can click and
46:50 - create a game right now there's a button
46:52 - below that says no games available but
46:53 - if there's a game available then anyone
46:55 - can join
46:57 - join a random game that someone else has
46:59 - created and what the game is is
47:03 - once it starts you could have any number
47:05 - of people that have joined that game
47:07 - and you need to take a picture of
47:09 - whatever it tells you to take a picture
47:11 - of and whoever takes that the picture of
47:13 - that thing first wins
47:15 - and it will notify everyone that you won
47:18 - or lost and then it will take you back
47:19 - to the home page so it's kind of like
47:21 - um
47:22 - blazing fast machine learning
47:25 - uh image recognition scavenger hunt
47:28 - um
47:29 - that uh you can play with your friends
47:31 - or anyone throughout the world
47:33 - so um if any of you would like to play
47:36 - yeah all right let's do it all right all
47:38 - right phone's up
47:40 - okay
47:41 - so yeah let's go ahead and create the
47:43 - game elegant
47:45 - uh so it's s-i-c-c dash p-i-c-c-s
47:50 - sick dash picks dot netlify.com
47:54 - sig fix on netflix.com
47:57 - and so you can once you get there
47:59 - you can click join a random game
48:02 - no sorry sick picks it's just plc
48:12 - you might consider an easier spelling
48:18 - [Laughter]
48:32 - all right so it looks like we have six
48:34 - players in this game
48:35 - all right are you guys in good to go
48:37 - yeah i'm gonna go ahead and start
48:41 - all right we gotta take a picture of
48:42 - ketchup
48:43 - oh
48:45 - oh that's some high speed turning there
48:54 - i'm not sure why but you have a chance
48:56 - someone could get you in the events this
48:58 - is the fastest
49:00 - iphone
49:10 - [Laughter]
49:15 - big oh who won
49:17 - i lost two
49:19 - maybe i i didn't win i did something
49:21 - wrong
49:35 - [Laughter]
49:38 - hey out there they're in the kitchen
49:40 - they're ready
49:41 - yeah
49:42 - i might have ended up in a oh okay all
49:44 - right let's do it again you guys ready
49:46 - all right let's create that game
49:50 - whoa
49:51 - yeah
50:02 - i think you may have a good game on your
50:03 - hands all right pretty quick there's
50:05 - definitely less phones in here than
50:06 - there are players
50:09 - all right let's do this
50:13 - [Laughter]
50:23 - this is not a picture of ketchup
50:33 - you have to take one that is probably
50:35 - going to surpass the
50:37 - advances
50:38 - [Music]
50:43 - all right so yeah um yeah so right now
50:46 - anyone can create a game and when you
50:47 - join a game you just join any kind of
50:49 - random game um so yeah what we tried to
50:51 - do was uh
50:53 - make sure to clear out for the demo and
50:54 - get the game going so but yeah anyone
50:56 - with the the url can just go ahead and
50:59 - create a game and anyone can join and
51:00 - then whoever creates the game
51:02 - has the control to start and so right
51:04 - now what we have in our database as the
51:06 - options are ketchup in a coffee so that
51:09 - we know that we have it um but yeah with
51:12 - the clarify api uh we could add all
51:14 - kinds of things with all kinds of
51:16 - different models
51:17 - so um
51:19 - yeah
51:19 - all right worried that you might uh if
51:22 - you know if you open it up
51:24 - you might end up with
51:26 - you know requests for images in there
51:28 - that might put people in harm's way
51:31 - you know like for example images
51:34 - yeah
51:34 - so the images don't
51:36 - the images are all local so we're not
51:38 - doing anything with the images we're not
51:40 - sending them and the ones in the in our
51:42 - database are just a coffee and a ketchup
51:45 - not like a pickup truck on fire yeah
51:50 - what other kinds of images do you think
51:51 - you'd load in there to kind of expand
51:52 - the scope of the game
51:54 - what other kind of images yeah
51:57 - do you have an example or a thought or
51:59 - so
52:00 - dog
52:01 - dog oh you mean
52:03 - yeah so really it's we're kind of just
52:05 - limit
52:06 - all we're limited by is the clarify api
52:09 - so
52:10 - right now our model we have a model of
52:12 - the food model and we just have ketchup
52:14 - and coffee but yeah we could yeah we
52:16 - could
52:25 - we would control like what's available
52:27 - to be ended yeah for the scavenger hunt
52:30 - yeah and then right now so like all the
52:32 - whole game is is client based in terms
52:34 - of like determining whether you won or
52:36 - not so
52:37 - um
52:38 - which is it's kind of fun
52:40 - with um just the fact that we can have
52:43 - like almost the whole game client side
52:45 - which is kind of a lot of fun yeah
52:47 - what's the
52:49 - obviously it has like a real-time
52:51 - component and certainly what did you use
52:53 - for that
52:54 - um
52:55 - does anyone else wanna answer yeah so we
52:58 - used hasura
52:59 - um so asura is i mean for everyone
53:02 - listening who doesn't know yet uh real
53:03 - time uh it's a graphql api or a back-end
53:06 - database that has uh
53:08 - real-time capabilities so that's that's
53:10 - exactly why we chose to build the game
53:12 - you know because that's like one of the
53:14 - primary applications for it
53:15 - um
53:17 - yeah so one of the examples we would sub
53:19 - for example showing the number of people
53:20 - that are in the game you subscribe to
53:23 - uh the users that have a game id of the
53:26 - game that you you just created or the
53:27 - game that you're a part of and so um
53:30 - yeah any time that the postgres database
53:32 - changes you automatically get those
53:34 - those changes yeah whenever someone wins
53:35 - we're just like we said the game is
53:37 - completely client based so whenever
53:38 - someone updates the state you know and
53:40 - reacts that they won we just update that
53:43 - in the database so none of like no one's
53:44 - going to take a picture some weird and
53:46 - put and push toward database yeah right
53:48 - yeah so and then we also subscribe to
53:50 - the status of the game so if when it's
53:52 - pending and someone pushes start the
53:55 - game then it will update for everyone
53:58 - the fact that it's um started
54:00 - in progress and then when someone wins
54:02 - it updates to say that the game is
54:03 - finished and who the the winner was
54:06 - so um yeah we could we could expand to
54:09 - you know have user names or or names or
54:11 - also like you can choose which game that
54:13 - you want to join perhaps
54:15 - um yeah a lot of different ways we could
54:17 - expand up that way
54:18 - how was the development process like i
54:20 - guess how did you decide what you're
54:21 - going to build
54:25 - so we started yeah we started i think we
54:27 - i think we had um the apis in mind
54:30 - already like clarify and asura like they
54:32 - had like we just kind of thought about
54:34 - the possibilities and so
54:35 - um we decided again because i mean it's
54:38 - fun to make games right and like also um
54:40 - when you make something that's like
54:41 - something
54:42 - no one here has ever done something
54:43 - exactly like this before right and so
54:45 - we're all thinking creatively and
54:47 - everything and so it helped us
54:49 - i mean it pushed us you know what i mean
54:50 - so that's like one of the reasons we
54:52 - picked it
54:53 - and um but as far as the development
54:54 - process we started off with we
54:57 - initially started off with the gatsby um
54:59 - because um the graphql implementation
55:01 - there is relatively easy to use and the
55:03 - development screen is pretty fast but we
55:05 - ran into several problems um one being
55:08 - that graspy does get gatsby doesn't
55:10 - handle mutations subscriptions anything
55:12 - that's not a query very well and so we
55:14 - switched over to cray racked up
55:17 - and then we're using apollo as
55:19 - clarify api
55:21 - cloud
55:21 - and cloud narrative
55:22 - yeah we're sending our pictures to cloud
55:24 - number and then we're gonna image the
55:26 - url back and then sending that to
55:29 - clarify
55:31 - cool
55:32 - yeah all right well gentlemen thank you
55:34 - for the wonderful demo thanks for
55:36 - answering our many questions very
55:37 - exhaustive answers by the way it's
55:40 - clearly you put a lot of thought into
55:41 - the tools that you chose
55:43 - yeah cool thank you thank you very much
55:45 - thank you thank you thanks awesome
55:48 - pleasures
55:50 - thank you very much thank you you all
55:52 - have fun thanks again i'll see you
55:54 - downstairs
55:59 - this way unless you want to go
56:06 - i'm pretty impressed how are you all
56:07 - feeling yeah
56:09 - it's gonna be a hard decision that's
56:11 - true yeah
56:13 - i think it's really interesting to hear
56:15 - sort of what the process is that people
56:17 - are using and how some teams are really
56:19 - going hard at the beginning
56:21 - at the planning process
56:23 - and kind of making sure that they're
56:24 - building something up front that's going
56:26 - to be useful i think that's cool to
56:29 - i see
56:30 - maybe
56:31 - like society has advanced enough where
56:34 - like you know when i was when i was in
56:36 - getting into the industry i would have
56:39 - done that right
56:42 - yeah a it's a much more mature process
56:44 - that people seem to be undertaking
56:46 - as opposed to just like i think it would
56:47 - be cool to
56:50 - you know
56:51 - have three databases and then try and
56:54 - put them all together using an api
56:57 - that's strictly based on images
57:00 - i don't have any idea what i just said
57:02 - no no
57:07 - we probably don't we didn't even have an
57:09 - api right let's just talk to it we're
57:10 - all just
57:19 - were there days like that i mean i
57:21 - remember getting like floppy disks with
57:23 - shareware too play around with right
57:26 - like
57:27 - because
57:29 - when i was a kid you had to build your
57:31 - own computer
57:33 - where you could start writing code
57:38 - welcome
57:40 - hey colin right got it thanks for
57:42 - watching
57:43 - yes yeah i'm trying to be good with
57:45 - names
57:46 - okay well thank you so much for building
57:49 - this amazing project that vaulted you to
57:52 - what floor are we on
57:55 - like right above us all there is is a
57:56 - roof deck
57:57 - wow yeah it was a catapult
58:01 - right we heard that if we lose you're
58:03 - going to catapult this off the roof we
58:05 - would use it
58:06 - try
58:11 - in keeping with our double dare theme if
58:13 - you bolt it into jello
58:18 - just don't say i don't know
58:22 - all right well welcome it's it's so
58:24 - wonderful to have you both up here uh
58:27 - perhaps you could just
58:28 - tell us a little bit about yourself your
58:30 - background how you all met what brought
58:32 - you here
58:34 - okay so my name is faye yang i flew in
58:36 - from houston on friday houston texas
58:39 - um i started free co-camp about two
58:40 - years ago
58:42 - and because i wanted to learn a little
58:43 - bit more my day job's actually in
58:45 - corporate finance
58:46 - but i see the potential for the future
58:49 - and i would like to be able to work it
58:51 - more into my career
58:54 - my name is colin i live here in oakland
58:57 - currently i maintain a php app for a
59:01 - construction company that's working on
59:03 - the bart extension to san jose on a
59:05 - contract basis i would like to be doing
59:07 - a javascript javascript thing on more of
59:09 - a full-time basis
59:11 - we met
59:12 - um
59:13 - the day before friday yeah on discord um
59:17 - in the channel to do to me
59:20 - great and i think that's the second team
59:22 - that made it all the way here that had
59:24 - actually met and talked friday night so
59:26 - preparation planning
59:28 - definitely seems to work right yeah okay
59:31 - great well perhaps you could uh go ahead
59:33 - and tell us a little bit about
59:34 - smartypants and uh give us a demo
59:41 - so we're team smartypants
59:43 - tea like the teapot song in final
59:45 - jeopardy
59:47 - um we built this app because every year
59:49 - there's more than 300 000 people who'd
59:51 - like to qualify for the show but only
59:54 - 400 people actually bank it now this
59:56 - means that it's actually harder to get
59:59 - on jeopardy than into harvard
60:03 - i decided on monday that i would like to
60:05 - audition for jeopardy but in looking
60:07 - online i couldn't find any user friendly
60:09 - or modern resources so when we came here
60:13 - this is what we decided to build
60:16 - so when you look at it you're presented
60:18 - with a question the category and the
60:20 - value of the question
60:22 - so in the city of yuma in this state has
60:25 - a record of record average of four
60:27 - thousand fifty-five hours of sunshine
60:29 - each year
60:30 - any guesses arizona arizona
60:34 - oh sorry what is arizona
60:37 - you don't have to use the what is
60:39 - okay cool so when you type in the
60:40 - correct answer it increases your bank to
60:43 - 200 which was the worth
60:46 - of the i think it's 100 for the worth of
60:48 - the question
60:49 - 200 yeah so then it automatically
60:52 - advances you to the next question now
60:54 - for this one let's say we don't know we
60:56 - don't want to be docked we just hit
60:58 - enter to move on
60:59 - so
61:00 - no change now in this third one we're
61:03 - feeling confident we're going to take a
61:04 - guess any guess
61:07 - we'll take a guess
61:09 - and what we'll find is when it's wrong
61:11 - the answer will show up below but you
61:14 - also lose money in your bank well now
61:15 - that you have the answer you say okay
61:17 - let me type in the answer maybe it'll
61:18 - take it
61:20 - and
61:21 - we can't cheat on this what happens is
61:23 - when you hit enter no points no docking
61:26 - move on
61:29 - we found that this app will solve the
61:30 - real life problem of we can take it on
61:32 - the go it will be mobile friendly and it
61:34 - has the capability to be a pwa powered
61:38 - by gatsby
61:41 - we built smartypants using gatsby so
61:44 - that's react
61:46 - material ui netlify and fauna
61:50 - our first challenge was loading up the
61:52 - fauna database we used the fauna
61:56 - importer
61:58 - command line tool
61:59 - right away this gate was an issue that
62:01 - seems to have something to do with
62:04 - file format even though our json data
62:07 - validated just fine deba at fauna was
62:10 - super helpful he was kind enough to
62:11 - actually go on their internal slack
62:13 - channel
62:14 - and
62:15 - follow up seek help and follow up with
62:17 - me in an email it turned out what we
62:19 - needed was just a single flag on the
62:21 - command line i was just missing an
62:23 - option once we had that option it worked
62:25 - fine we loaded up
62:26 - 610 sample questions that's 10 shows
62:30 - worth
62:31 - out of
62:32 - our total set of 200 000 real world
62:36 - historic jeopardy questions that we've
62:37 - downloaded
62:39 - the next
62:40 - step was to
62:42 - wire up that fauna database to netlify
62:45 - using netlify's lambda function service
62:48 - this gave us three issues
62:53 - first of all in terms of
62:54 - development production parity we had to
62:57 - run a server to run the functions in
63:00 - development whereas in production
63:02 - they're on the same domain
63:04 - so then proxying to that server in
63:06 - gatsby
63:07 - it eluded us at first
63:09 - the second thing
63:10 - the toml file format gave us some issues
63:13 - we were putting sensitive data in there
63:15 - we were putting api keys in there and so
63:16 - we didn't want to version control it so
63:18 - then we were like how do we get that on
63:19 - netlify
63:21 - remove the api keys and use netlify's
63:23 - interface for environment variables like
63:25 - heroku um
63:28 - and the third thing was that gatsby and
63:31 - building on the back end didn't have
63:32 - access to window.fetch so we eventually
63:34 - figured out that we needed a fetch
63:36 - polyfill
63:37 - um in all of these i have to get a give
63:40 - a huge shout out to sean at netlify who
63:43 - was super generous and super patient he
63:46 - basically sat with us and paired with us
63:48 - through all of these problems he seems
63:50 - to like share our stoke at every success
63:54 - point on all of these
63:56 - in resolving all of these issues and a
63:59 - couple more really it was about
64:01 - simplified the simplest possible use
64:03 - case and console log
64:07 - that's something that i would say to
64:08 - other free code camp learners especially
64:10 - people who are just starting out
64:12 - simplify simplify simplify and then get
64:14 - some output as soon as possible console
64:16 - log it
64:18 - overall our biggest sticking point was
64:20 - wiring up all these apis together i
64:23 - spent all day yesterday and an hour of
64:25 - this morning just getting these various
64:26 - apis to work together and to get a
64:29 - build that would deploy
64:31 - um
64:32 - so that took away a lot of time from
64:34 - actually building ui from actually
64:35 - building react components
64:37 - now that i've done it once though i
64:39 - would definitely go back i would
64:41 - definitely use netlify and this host of
64:43 - services again
64:46 - so for future applications for the
64:48 - jeopardy specific we want to add more
64:50 - gameplay options but i think we have an
64:53 - opportunity to also use this as a
64:54 - framework
64:57 - so i used to teach
64:59 - english to um
65:01 - elderly iranian immigrants who were
65:03 - trying to qualify for citizenship so you
65:06 - could take this this framework all you
65:09 - need is your own fauna key
65:11 - and
65:12 - an appropriately
65:14 - formatted set of
65:16 - questions in json format and you could
65:19 - upload those to your own fauna database
65:20 - and then you could make something like a
65:22 - citizenship quiz app that you could take
65:25 - on the go
65:26 - use at home at work on the bus etc
65:32 - great
65:33 - first of all it sounds like you all
65:34 - learned quite a bit
65:36 - for sure
65:39 - do you have um like ideas about i don't
65:42 - know um opening it up to be a
65:45 - multi-player contest or uh end users can
65:48 - submit new questions or that kind of
65:50 - thing
65:51 - um for end users submitting questions if
65:53 - we're connecting to the jeopardy
65:54 - historic database i think maybe not but
65:57 - for their expansion
65:59 - uh with using different frameworks yes
66:01 - in terms of other players we toured with
66:03 - the idea of doing user authentication
66:05 - with profile with stats to strengthen
66:07 - categories a leaderboard but with the
66:10 - limited amount of time that we had this
66:11 - weekend we've opened up an own issue in
66:14 - our repo to work on it in the future
66:17 - i would definitely say that user
66:18 - identities and persisting data
66:20 - would be one of our next steps
66:23 - so it was i mean i think one of the
66:25 - things everybody here loved like liked
66:27 - about this app was that you scoped it
66:29 - very well so you can easily see adding
66:30 - that in the future right but
66:32 - starting out with building something
66:34 - that in itself works and gives the idea
66:36 - before worrying about that it's a really
66:38 - good approach
66:40 - thank you thanks
66:41 - yeah the core gameplay is
66:44 - there are some other things that you did
66:47 - early on to kind of try and scope the
66:49 - project or
66:50 - divide up the work or do the planning
66:52 - before you actually started writing code
66:57 - drew it out about how we want the basic
66:59 - ui to look at potential gameplay formats
67:01 - that we would pick a couple
67:03 - and then how we would maybe do users and
67:06 - how we'd split it up so ui ux react and
67:08 - then more of the back end linking up the
67:10 - different apis
67:12 - and from our very first contact i would
67:13 - say we immediately started talking about
67:17 - what mvp looked like what our literal
67:19 - minimal scope looked like and then
67:21 - actually we have a teammate who can't be
67:22 - here because he's at work
67:24 - he so i said it took away time from
67:26 - working on the ui he actually was
67:27 - working on like basic ui without being
67:30 - wired up to any back end yesterday while
67:32 - we were doing the api wire up stuff
67:36 - so so you were able to work in tandem
67:38 - and not block one another totally yeah
67:41 - synchronously
67:43 - all right
67:45 - do you have any other questions
67:47 - for colin faye
67:49 - straight up would you keep uh working on
67:51 - it afterwards or did we already hit that
67:53 - like are you thinking about experience
67:54 - sure yeah we have like at least two or
67:56 - three issues that aren't
67:59 - very far off for us that i think we
68:01 - could get to really quickly and i would
68:03 - say um when people look for jobs after
68:05 - free code camp they say build your
68:06 - portfolio don't just build what's on the
68:08 - coursework build what's your passion
68:10 - project and i think i found mine in this
68:12 - one
68:13 - nice
68:14 - great and uh just one last question when
68:16 - are you planning to apply to uh to be on
68:19 - jeopardy
68:20 - i don't know i have a lot of studying
68:22 - but first i need to build this app then
68:24 - i'll study with the app
68:27 - all right great well thank you so much
68:30 - it's been a pleasure thanks good to see
68:31 - you again
68:37 - wow
68:38 - a lot of games tonight yeah yeah yeah it
68:40 - seems like a popular way to uh
68:43 - make something cool for a hackathon
68:45 - absolutely and pretty exciting to again
68:48 - like if you're doing a game that single
68:50 - player experience the first thing you
68:53 - feel when you pick the game up matters
68:54 - so much to the success of the game yeah
68:56 - so like they did you can scope your app
68:58 - and leave out like so much of the hard
69:00 - heavy lift and still get your gameplay
69:01 - done yeah
69:03 - yeah and
69:04 - what's the first game that any of you
69:07 - created did you ever i mean everyone's
69:08 - had to create a game at some point like
69:10 - the first has always been like the
69:12 - tutorial doing the kissing kiss and
69:14 - number games yeah that has to be like
69:16 - the first one
69:18 - i created like a star trek next
69:19 - generation quiz game
69:23 - i don't know about first but
69:26 - like high pressure was like uh somehow i
69:29 - didn't know that i was gonna have like a
69:30 - whole bunch of people who were you know
69:33 - from overseas in my office like learning
69:36 - the technology and
69:38 - that morning so i woke up and got to
69:39 - work and here's all these people and
69:41 - they don't really speak english and they
69:43 - need to learn nosql and so
69:45 - i i've got the monitor up with my editor
69:48 - and i was like let's make a game
69:50 - nice nice
69:52 - yeah i also ended up making a game
69:53 - yesterday
69:54 - oh yeah and live stream
69:58 - all right well next up
70:00 - uh we have the
70:03 - this jam
70:04 - fizzy jam
70:05 - yeah thank you
70:07 - busy jam
70:08 - and uh so so thrilled to have you all
70:10 - here
70:11 - very impressed with your application we
70:13 - can't wait to see it but we can wait
70:15 - because first
70:16 - we want to learn a little bit about you
70:17 - all we'll start here with zubin and then
70:19 - we'll go in clockwise order can i answer
70:22 - real quick what was it about a project
70:24 - that impressed you
70:26 - first
70:27 - so many things so many things yeah but
70:29 - several things yes
70:31 - it's a very impressive
70:32 - application and uh you know just you
70:35 - know the animation but i won't i won't
70:38 - i'll wait i'll restrain myself
70:40 - so
70:41 - before i wax poetically about your app
70:43 - i'll let the rest of the world see it
70:46 - zoom in take it away hey um my name is
70:48 - zubin um i'm actually from melbourne
70:50 - australia i was here at work and um i
70:53 - reached out to quincy got a ticket
70:54 - because i really wanted to be part of
70:55 - this i'm a free curriculum student in
70:57 - fact free code camps that have rescued
70:59 - me from from deep depression because i
71:01 - couldn't figure out how to code before
71:02 - if we could get like i'd given up twice
71:04 - and then thanks for please go camp um i
71:06 - really got back on and it's been upwards
71:08 - since so really excited to use my skills
71:10 - here
71:11 - awesome welcome welcome to the states i
71:13 - love it here
71:15 - great i'm sean i was born and raised in
71:18 - the bay
71:19 - um i was originally in i.t and i since
71:23 - left my job to pursue learning code
71:27 - full time
71:28 - and i've been doing it about a year now
71:31 - and this is my first hackathon so
71:34 - excited to learn
71:36 - hi my name is ilan i'm originally from
71:38 - colombia
71:39 - i've been in the bay area for about five
71:41 - years and i'm a front-end developer
71:44 - and i love the idea of jumpstart so i'm
71:46 - very thrilled to be here until the end
71:50 - my name is juan i'm from
71:53 - massachusetts
71:54 - and i'm currently a student at rhythm
71:56 - school yeah
71:58 - let's go to school
72:00 - my name is sarah i just moved to san
72:02 - francisco a couple months ago to also
72:03 - attend rhythm school and this was my
72:05 - first hackathon so it's great to be here
72:07 - i learned a lot great
72:09 - yeah my name is david lau and i'm a free
72:13 - co-camp student and i just i've been
72:15 - going through the curriculum the full
72:16 - stack the new full stack web development
72:19 - curriculum
72:20 - and uh
72:22 - i learned so much going through this
72:25 - project
72:26 - uh that you wouldn't learn by yourself
72:29 - because it's just a completely different
72:30 - setting
72:31 - i mean you think you know everything
72:33 - already but once you work with other
72:34 - people
72:35 - you don't know
72:37 - is my language
72:39 - but no it's great to work with other
72:41 - people with different backgrounds and
72:44 - you need to like just work with other
72:46 - people you think like you think you know
72:48 - it all but you don't you can always work
72:50 - with more people and yeah i love these
72:51 - guys great well
72:54 - word to the audience come to hackathons
72:56 - put yourself out there get experience
72:58 - working with a team
73:00 - all right so
73:01 - let's see it all right you ready cool
73:03 - yeah all right so i'll quickly introduce
73:05 - busy jam so
73:07 - um we like to think of easy jam as it's
73:09 - time to
73:11 - do to forget about pokemon capture data
73:13 - instead
73:14 - you know when you when you come to a
73:15 - hackathon there's a real problem with
73:16 - invisible data you know who's who's
73:18 - there what level of experience do they
73:19 - have do they need to team members or not
73:22 - how do they find team members and then
73:23 - there's a problem for actual organizers
73:25 - and the uh you know the product managers
73:27 - and others who run the sponsorship side
73:29 - of things right so the api and things
73:30 - like that all the apis available
73:33 - who's using it
73:34 - whether they had an easy time or not
73:35 - such an easy time using why did they
73:37 - choose to use it this is all really
73:38 - valuable information from the
73:39 - organizational point of view so
73:41 - eventually what we're going to make busy
73:43 - jam do is also be a matchmaking service
73:44 - for attendees and at the same time
73:46 - provide really high quality data to
73:49 - organizers and the and the sponsors um
73:52 - when we got together we realized um it
73:54 - was such a pain because none of us
73:55 - actually knew each other it was hard to
73:57 - find team members and that right away
73:58 - was an immediate you know problem that
74:00 - we wanted to try and solve that's where
74:02 - this started and then we said before we
74:04 - start building or writing and code let's
74:05 - actually validate this so we went and
74:06 - had a whole bunch of interviews spoke to
74:08 - a bunch of people
74:09 - interviewed each other and others who
74:10 - had attended
74:12 - identified the basic problem statement
74:14 - then started
74:15 - prioritizing what we wanted to build
74:16 - researched the apis built it you know it
74:18 - was a great experience uh and so what
74:20 - visijam does now as you can see it's
74:22 - it's a pretty straightforward dashboard
74:23 - we've got all that is real-time data and
74:25 - so we've used
74:27 - gatsby and netlify of course we also use
74:29 - formspree
74:30 - so that's actually real data from
74:32 - attendees at this um
74:35 - at this hackathon so david if you want
74:36 - to go to the entry form um so that's
74:39 - actually we can actually start bunching
74:41 - in data right now and david will do that
74:42 - as i speak but it asks a bunch of
74:44 - questions um and you can see that it'll
74:46 - update so when we go back to the
74:47 - dashboard you will see for example if
74:49 - david were to say that he's now very
74:51 - experienced in java it'll show that
74:53 - there was another person who's increased
74:55 - his you know
74:56 - level of experience and let's say java
74:58 - um we can add stuff fairly quickly to
75:01 - this that also talks about what uh what
75:02 - apis they use right now we're using form
75:05 - spree for the actual form um and we're
75:08 - also using phone streams back-end with
75:09 - an api endpoint from where we can
75:11 - retrieve the data we're using um netlify
75:14 - to actually run the continuous
75:15 - deployment um and you know the netlife
75:18 - login page is also possible but that
75:20 - makes sense only once we have a proper
75:21 - user data model and stuff like that um
75:24 - right now
75:25 - you can see that when he's when he
75:27 - submits it it'll say okay um
75:29 - what i want is i don't want i want the
75:31 - viewer to be able to see that i made a
75:33 - change in the data
75:34 - so what i'm going to do is i need to
75:37 - make another tab
75:38 - and
75:40 - because i don't want it like dummy data
75:43 - so so so that when i do something
75:45 - actually the change is reflected so
75:47 - right now the percentage of mail you can
75:49 - see is gender 6624 so once i enter my
75:52 - form data it should theoretically
75:54 - increase 66.2
75:57 - by whatever one of whatever is the total
76:00 - so as long as larger than that so we
76:03 - will know it's different 66 point
76:05 - yeah so go to this actually doesn't work
76:08 - it goes to the yeah you can go back to
76:10 - the video
76:11 - yes go back to that yeah i'll go back to
76:12 - the bookmark
76:14 - so mail was 66.2
76:16 - it's 66.7 so there was a difference so
76:18 - we can see that there's a change in the
76:19 - data yeah and what we did was we had
76:23 - members of our team walk up to other
76:25 - attendees and personally deliver this
76:28 - kind of survey conduct the kind of
76:29 - survey ask them
76:30 - these questions some of us ask them
76:32 - questions i just gave them the links
76:35 - like hey can you could you do this for
76:37 - us
76:38 - and you know yeah you're nice yeah
76:40 - they'll say yeah of course why not it's
76:42 - just a couple minutes just fill out a
76:43 - simple form but yeah the root problem as
76:48 - zubin uh mentioned was when we all came
76:50 - in we didn't know who who each other are
76:53 - and we could use this data to if we had
76:55 - this data beforehand we would know
76:57 - better about our other attendees oh you
77:00 - work with javascript i work with
77:01 - javascript too it's just easier way to
77:04 - know who each other are it would have
77:06 - been helpful
77:07 - if we had this before but we made it now
77:10 - we can use this for future hackathons
77:12 - anything we can expand it to wherever we
77:14 - want but we can do that all in two days
77:16 - so we just did what we could the basic
77:19 - one of our users actually had a really
77:20 - cool suggestion they're like you know
77:21 - we've done two or three of the attack
77:23 - accounts before but we don't have a
77:24 - profile that says that um with the link
77:26 - to the hackathon then i actually thought
77:27 - that's actually a fantastic idea let's
77:29 - talk about you know user generated
77:30 - product development right somebody
77:32 - actually okay so you know if um david's
77:34 - done three hackathons these are the
77:36 - dates this you know this is the link
77:37 - it's a great platform for hackathons to
77:39 - advertise their hack accounts as well
77:40 - yeah and the products that could be like
77:42 - there's so much stuff we could use and
77:44 - unlike other you know we wanted to be
77:46 - careful not to make it a trivial
77:47 - custodial application we want to make it
77:48 - something that could prove that the apis
77:50 - were also capable of supporting a b2b
77:52 - use case which i think is really
77:53 - important from a monetization point of
77:55 - view for the api certainly so we said
77:57 - okay if this was a serious product could
77:59 - it actually you know could the apis
78:01 - actually support it and they absolutely
78:02 - can so that's great
78:04 - excellent thank you for the demo it's
78:09 - questions have you thought about how to
78:11 - get the word out to me this is like
78:12 - tailor made for uh press releases and
78:15 - having magazines right here i'm enough
78:16 - to get on a live stream i don't know if
78:18 - you have any ideas on how you can do
78:19 - that but that would be awesome
78:26 - um
78:27 - but yeah we can always make it
78:29 - we can always make it better i know it
78:30 - looks kind of uh
78:32 - it looks simple right now but we can
78:34 - make it like more interactive
78:37 - uh so that once you enter like once you
78:40 - enter your data you can know exactly
78:41 - like you'll animate so you can see the
78:43 - change in difference of the data so it
78:45 - doesn't look like i have to refresh the
78:46 - page
78:47 - uh but yeah let's we can look over the
78:50 - data and this kind of data could be
78:51 - interesting to a data scientist who
78:53 - studies data i don't think any we none
78:55 - of us had kind of background data
78:57 - scientists but i've heard of what they
78:59 - do i mean i know what their role is it's
79:01 - different than us we're doing
79:02 - development we make the structure we use
79:05 - the structure and build up the product
79:06 - but
79:07 - to this a data scientist they could see
79:10 - oh you know this uh
79:12 - this event had many attendees who had
79:15 - program who had experience with
79:17 - javascript right like 20 beginners
79:19 - 18
79:20 - 38 intermediate
79:22 - and 5 advanced
79:24 - and
79:26 - not many not many ruby
79:27 - developers so probably not many too many
79:29 - who develop on ruby
79:31 - most
79:32 - kicks just jumping actually because
79:34 - that's an interesting question do you
79:35 - guys how would you guys want to use this
79:37 - because you know we've asked a lot of
79:38 - the participants we haven't had a chance
79:40 - to ask people who actually produce the
79:42 - apis and the management how would you
79:44 - like to use something like this so how
79:45 - would you see this be useful well you
79:47 - mentioned a little bit matchmaking which
79:50 - would you know you need to go deeper so
79:51 - you'd model the individual correct
79:53 - there's an individual uh you know who
79:55 - fills out the survey yeah yeah that was
79:57 - a feature that we talked about in our
79:58 - planning process um but you know we were
80:00 - thinking about what's our minimum viable
80:02 - product in a two-day period it was kind
80:03 - of on the wish list yeah yeah we had to
80:05 - be really strict about prioritizing but
80:07 - you know that's the perfect sort of
80:08 - thing for a graph you are kind of you
80:10 - know back in it would be awesome yeah
80:12 - any other ideas at what point did you
80:14 - guys all decide like this is what we're
80:17 - going to build instead of building i
80:19 - think we had like this basic concept um
80:22 - pretty quickly like within five minutes
80:24 - of discussing our plan yeah um and then
80:26 - we kind of had a sort of like spider web
80:28 - conversation of like what about these
80:29 - features we made a list um and then
80:32 - probably took another 20 minutes to
80:34 - really narrow down like this is our
80:35 - minimum viable product and i think one
80:37 - of the big challenges we faced is
80:40 - um even when we were starting out we
80:41 - started out with a static json file that
80:43 - we were loading the data from
80:45 - and then we wanted to transition to the
80:47 - live update that hits the api so a lot
80:50 - of us are really new to git and so um
80:52 - having kind of different branches where
80:53 - we were experimenting with different
80:54 - things
80:55 - um created submerged conflicts so it was
80:58 - actually great to have the opportunity
81:00 - to kind of work through that together no
81:01 - you you asked how it the idea started
81:04 - right
81:05 - it it actually uh started uh when we all
81:08 - sat down and we had the brainstorming
81:10 - idea and uh elon he just threw it out
81:13 - there say you know we should we should
81:16 - start asking people around i mean he had
81:18 - he had the initiative to just bring it
81:19 - up
81:20 - and we were all listening we were
81:21 - thinking if it's a good idea
81:23 - we thought about it and we said yeah
81:25 - let's just let's do it yeah i have to
81:27 - definitely commend your execution
81:29 - because it takes
81:30 - i can speak from experience having built
81:32 - projects where you go around and you ask
81:33 - everybody back upon do something it
81:35 - takes a lot of uh
81:38 - work and a lot of courage to approach
81:40 - your peers and stick an ipad in their
81:42 - hand or however you were going about
81:44 - doing it so
81:45 - yeah it's really impressive you might
81:47 - scroll down just a little bit to the
81:49 - years of coding so according to
81:51 - typeform which is what we use to collect
81:54 - uh data for advent giving up the tickets
81:58 - the tickets were free but you had to go
81:59 - through this tutorial this jam stack
82:01 - tutorial i created uh and one of the
82:03 - questions was
82:04 - how long you've been coding
82:06 - and uh the median number of months was
82:09 - 16 16 months coding which is right there
82:13 - yeah so this is where yeah so it's
82:15 - between one and two years so yeah that's
82:16 - exactly right that's the representation
82:18 - that's distribution just between 12 and
82:20 - 20.
82:21 - yeah yeah so it's pretty cool that uh
82:24 - your data is so representative as my
82:26 - data which was like a thousand data
82:27 - points yeah that's great yeah it shows
82:30 - like yeah there's a wide range of
82:31 - experience
82:32 - and
82:33 - uh yeah there's something that works
82:35 - less than six months
82:37 - so you know if you're attending someone
82:39 - maybe your experience and you want to
82:40 - group up with someone
82:42 - uh
82:43 - experience as well so you know you know
82:45 - you guys can get started real quick
82:47 - right away maybe you know you want to
82:49 - grow up with someone with less
82:50 - experience so you can mentor them that's
82:52 - a possibility too if you knew if people
82:54 - who signed up had less experience you
82:56 - could link them up with the people who
82:58 - are looking for
83:00 - people looking for
83:01 - and i think also like in just promoting
83:03 - you know future hackathons you know for
83:05 - me this was my first hackathon and i was
83:07 - kind of wondering whether i should sign
83:08 - up or not am i going to be ready um and
83:10 - so seeing you know that oh in the last
83:12 - hackathon there were people who had less
83:13 - than six months of coding experience um
83:15 - could be a way to make you know more
83:17 - people feel comfortable in the future
83:19 - were there questions you wanted to put
83:21 - in but left out because you didn't have
83:22 - too many questions absolutely i mean we
83:25 - wanted to actually
83:26 - talk about stuff like we'll you know
83:28 - hopefully we were thinking if we could
83:29 - collect the data fairly close to the end
83:31 - but we knew that's a high pressure time
83:32 - everyone's going to just tell us to take
83:34 - a hike right but the idea was you know
83:36 - which of the apis you use and actually
83:37 - just have a chat but like we've got the
83:39 - form widget i just haven't
83:40 - productionized that that bit because you
83:42 - know we didn't want to add that um there
83:44 - were a couple of questions like that how
83:45 - many have you done before and stuff like
83:47 - that so we just wanted to prioritize
83:48 - what we know people would be happy to
83:49 - share very quickly it takes less than 30
83:51 - seconds to collect the data when we went
83:53 - out but ahead um that kind of stuff yeah
83:56 - yeah and as part of the ideation process
83:58 - we talked about if we wanted to be more
84:00 - individual contributor like a member or
84:02 - someone attending
84:03 - uh focused or uh like uh sponsor focus
84:06 - right so
84:08 - with
84:09 - once we decide on that we were also able
84:10 - to kind of parse through the questions
84:12 - and be like okay this is something more
84:13 - that like netlify would want to know
84:16 - right this is more something someone
84:17 - like me sarah or elon would want to know
84:20 - so we did that as well
84:22 - well i'm very impressed with this and i
84:24 - could definitely see this as being kind
84:26 - of like
84:27 - one of the major components of
84:29 - essentially
84:30 - a larger open source hackathon toolkit
84:34 - that hackathon organizers could use
84:37 - and
84:38 - one of the things we built over the
84:39 - weekend at freecodecamp was that
84:41 - leaderboard
84:42 - we called it the project index because
84:44 - it wasn't actually a leaderboard but it
84:46 - you know
84:48 - this plus that which is open source i
84:50 - think they put the mit license on it um
84:53 - and all these other uh tools that we
84:56 - could potentially come up with you know
84:57 - we could potentially have like a whole
84:59 - suite when you want to have a hackathon
85:01 - clone this repo yeah get started right
85:05 - license as well yeah quincy actually i
85:08 - want to bring this up
85:10 - we did was actually something you did
85:12 - earlier earlier simpler uh uh before
85:15 - like this year which was like a
85:18 - uh every time you sign up to sign into
85:20 - freecodecampage there's a survey a link
85:23 - with the header it says click here we're
85:25 - we're doing a
85:26 - mass survey of all the
85:28 - uh developers please spend give us five
85:31 - minutes that's that's exactly what we
85:33 - did
85:34 - we asked people you know their
85:36 - background just demographic information
85:38 - that's just what you did and then we we
85:40 - just brought alive to the to the
85:43 - to the tendons the locationality of it
85:46 - uh and the temporality of it are
85:48 - definitely an interesting
85:51 - uh aspect and what uh what dave is
85:53 - referencing is the
85:55 - 2018 new coder survey which we
85:57 - interviewed 30 000 people
85:59 - uh
86:00 - we had them all fill out a survey we're
86:02 - currently crunching those numbers but
86:03 - we're gonna
86:04 - release that as a giant public data set
86:06 - hopefully in a month or so and you know
86:08 - people are interested in that data right
86:10 - we're going to get it out there yeah hey
86:12 - oh thank you so much thank you
86:14 - thanks everybody david thank you sarah
86:17 - juan
86:18 - elon

87:32 - go around and talk about each of you and
87:35 - your background
87:37 - and what drew you to this hackathon
87:39 - we'll start with you sure my name is
87:41 - tatis i
87:43 - i've been a full stack develop web
87:44 - developer for a few years but recently

88:20 - i like working on the interface and what
88:23 - you see and
88:25 - you know if i can have apis take care of
88:27 - the back end it's
88:28 - great so i i wanted to meet more people
88:30 - that are

89:06 - and
89:07 - i've been using
89:10 - netlify in my freelance work
89:12 - and i
89:13 - couldn't miss the chance to come to a
89:15 - sponsored jam stack conference and
89:18 - hackathon
89:19 - sounds like you all have a lot of jam
89:21 - stack experience between the four of you
89:24 - it's awesome uh
89:27 - jeff you want to take it away with the
89:28 - demo
89:29 - yeah so
89:30 - um well i guess yeah we're team where in

90:21 - it'll keep up updating as more players
90:23 - join looks like we've got you might want
90:25 - to drag the window just a little bit
90:26 - yeah
90:28 - is it not yeah hopefully it's right on
90:29 - the screen 18. wow
90:32 - yeah
90:32 - great all right
90:34 - so now we can full team i think we're
90:36 - about ready let's kick it off we're
90:37 - gonna we're gonna kick it we're using a
90:39 - little netify function with our we might
90:40 - play a couple back again
90:43 - there's gonna be an image and then
90:45 - there's a map okay you wanna pick like
90:47 - point a pin
90:49 - on the map where you think that image is
90:51 - that's basically it where in the world
90:54 - the image is all right are you ready
90:56 - kick it off here okay let's do it
91:00 - so now everyone sees this and if it you
91:02 - know the mobile should see uh the images
91:05 - the map below the image
91:07 - and if you're on a desktop you'll see
91:09 - you can see where i'm guessing so now
91:10 - [Laughter]
91:12 - now jeff has guessed he's submitted
91:14 - everyone else is getting their
91:15 - submissions in and as everyone else is
91:16 - guessing we're going to see them pop up
91:18 - live here uh wherever
91:20 - everyone thinks it is
91:23 - and then you also if you make the screen
91:24 - a little smaller we can see the scores
91:26 - on the right as well oh yeah don't
91:28 - forget to hit submit because if you
91:29 - don't hit submit you just won't get uh
91:32 - you just won't get the uh
91:33 - we won't record your submit your your
91:35 - yes
91:36 - what happened there
91:37 - but uh don't worry we run it again we
91:39 - can run another game in a second here
91:40 - but you can see the scores are popping
91:42 - up there on the right um as as
91:44 - everyone's done and the game is over
91:45 - right yeah the game is over it's you get
91:47 - 30 seconds and uh that was that's the
91:50 - game
91:51 - so we can play let's do another one
91:53 - do another one for those of you who
91:54 - missed
91:55 - might have had anything unclear with the
91:56 - instructions
91:58 - so play again pops up you should have a
92:00 - button up here yeah or in your mobile
92:03 - app somewhere click play again on top to
92:05 - play again
92:06 - so now we'll be in the waiting room oh
92:08 - man we got 21 now
92:11 - getting up there
92:12 - yeah just gonna feel the pressure random
92:14 - all right
92:14 - ready to play another one
92:16 - let's do it
92:20 - all right here we go we're live where in
92:22 - the world
92:24 - jeff
92:27 - middle of the united states
92:29 - i don't think there's any water there
92:30 - jeff
92:33 - colorado maybe oh maybe
92:34 - [Laughter]
92:37 - we've got oh everyone's so far away
92:39 - what's we're all over the place here
92:41 - what's going on oh someone's in idaho
92:43 - lots of california san francisco is that
92:46 - the yeah could that be the golden gate
92:47 - bridge
92:48 - it looks like a golden gate bridge
92:50 - is it oh but i don't know some people
92:52 - are
93:07 - all right and i was very far off
93:09 - but now later on
93:14 - all right good job
93:16 - right on the mark
93:20 - all right yeah so that that's our demo
93:22 - and we'll pull up our little
93:23 - acknowledgement slide here
93:25 - we jammed a lot together
93:27 - into this little app here but uh we can
93:30 - run through this asura was
93:32 - very instrumental in that we were making
93:35 - use of graphql subscriptions and it made
93:37 - it really easy to set those up like the
93:39 - websocket endpoint that they
93:41 - automatically generated for us and i
93:42 - made that really easy netlify we
93:45 - obviously deployed on netlife and then
93:46 - also used a lot of netlife functions so
93:48 - that's uh when when we're when we're
93:50 - waiting to get the game started we have
93:51 - a little like on our github readme we
93:53 - set up a little admin panel that makes
93:56 - it easy to just start a game with
93:57 - different uh with different images that
93:59 - we have lined up uh curated to go and
94:01 - then on the bottom we have all the
94:03 - little pieces the little moving pieces
94:05 - that uh help make it happen so it's a
94:07 - it's a react app we're using apollo on
94:09 - the client side to do the graphql
94:11 - integration with asura heroku is hosting
94:14 - our
94:15 - asura instance then the google maps api
94:18 - provided the map and the some of the
94:20 - slack and github tooling we used for
94:23 - start development process essentially
94:27 - yeah great good demo
94:30 - how'd you all get together as a team and
94:32 - how did you choose what you were going
94:34 - to build
94:36 - well we all kind of met each other at
94:38 - the conference we were all at the
94:39 - conference and sort of we're mutually
94:41 - connected there
94:43 - and we formed our team yesterday morning
94:46 - at breakfast
94:48 - and
94:49 - threw out some ideas
94:51 - and we just chose one shortly after the
94:54 - keynote and
94:55 - went with it yeah we were we kind of the
94:58 - way we described what we honed in on is
95:00 - uh that we wanted to do two things we
95:02 - wanted to show the power
95:04 - show the
95:05 - show the power of the jam stack and also
95:07 - show people the world that was the kind
95:09 - of
95:10 - nice
95:14 - how uh what was kind of the develop i
95:16 - guess the like product development
95:18 - process like did you uh
95:20 - you know did you do any drawings did you
95:22 - kind of like do any i don't know
95:25 - case
95:26 - uh user study kind of thing or anything
95:28 - like that or did you just dive right
95:29 - into write code
95:31 - we did some uh like data modeling we had
95:34 - i brought in a little mini white board
95:35 - with this guy
95:41 - uh so we did some data modeling so that
95:43 - way we could have like some sample data
95:46 - in our database um and it was really
95:48 - good for just kind of driving a
95:49 - discussion of like oh like we didn't
95:50 - think about this concept the same way so
95:52 - then we were able to kind of bridge
95:53 - those gaps before we started writing a
95:55 - single line of code or thinking of a
95:56 - single mock yeah
95:58 - and then we split up like
96:01 - someone working on the data setting up
96:03 - the database and then
96:04 - working on the front end we decided to
96:06 - do a pair programming because we didn't
96:08 - want to like too much confusion and we
96:11 - could just put two minds in onto one
96:13 - computer and that worked really well i
96:14 - think that was yeah yeah
96:16 - because especially like there were
96:17 - moments where like oh like somebody was
96:18 - really honed in on something needed to
96:20 - get something done maybe we were you
96:21 - know a few like an hour before or some
96:23 - deadline and then but because we
96:25 - programmed most of it we were always
96:27 - able to rely on some other person who
96:28 - knew each piece of the like all these
96:30 - different pieces that were working
96:31 - together so we could always have like
96:33 - kind of like a fallback plan in case
96:34 - like the person who had actually been
96:36 - doing the driving wasn't available at
96:38 - the moment
96:39 - yeah what features um are you know just
96:42 - outside of scope that you would add if
96:43 - you had more time
96:45 - the two big ones that we
96:47 - had had in mind were the ability for
96:49 - users to kind of like facilitate these
96:51 - games in the sense that like uploading
96:53 - the photos um you know we think we one
96:56 - of our inspirations was trivia hq so we
96:58 - like the concept of having one game
96:59 - going on but it'd be nice if kind of
97:02 - with our show the world kind of mission
97:04 - uh if users could like say like i you
97:06 - know i really i think this place is
97:08 - really cool and i want more people to
97:09 - know about it let me submit a photo of
97:10 - that place and let's play a game about
97:12 - it and then the other one is kind of
97:14 - have like a different uh potentially
97:16 - like different localizations for the
97:17 - games so like everyone can play a world
97:19 - game but if we were to like say let's
97:21 - play like a san francisco kind of game
97:23 - then there would be like the like level
97:25 - of granularity at which the photos would
97:26 - come in and that people could play would
97:28 - be only relevant to people who like
97:30 - really know the area so then just kind
97:31 - of like different levels of localization
97:32 - would be interesting as well yeah
97:35 - yeah that's
97:37 - i could see this being really popular my
97:39 - parents love that trivia hq game and
97:41 - they always play together and i could
97:43 - definitely see this being like a
97:44 - community thing like san francisco has
97:46 - so many distinctive landmarks and even
97:49 - little benches that people might be able
97:51 - to recognize you know yeah
97:53 - for sure we thought long term maybe we
97:55 - could introduce training of machine
97:57 - learning
97:58 - on some of these images um maybe do like
98:01 - a what in the world app where you could
98:03 - look at certain things and
98:05 - see what those things are but yeah
98:07 - that's kind of a far goal
98:10 - yeah
98:11 - all right well thank you so much for
98:13 - coming in and giving this awesome demo
98:15 - thanks for coming out yeah i'm building
98:18 - this it's
98:19 - you've used a lot of different tools
98:23 - yeah i'm just uh i think it's always
98:25 - awesome when something is is scoped just
98:27 - right so you can actually like really
98:30 - end up with it with a working demo and a
98:32 - live domain and
98:34 - launch something to the world in the
98:36 - weekend yeah i think
98:38 - to be honest like with all the tools it
98:40 - makes that easier like i'm surprised
98:42 - that in two days we could do this but i
98:44 - think
98:45 - like all of these tools number five sort
98:47 - of
98:48 - react i mean it's like
98:50 - yeah pretty cool i think i would have
98:52 - spent a half a hackathon just putting up
98:54 - a website when i was a full stack web
98:56 - developer and now i was like not the
98:57 - fight buy domain deploy oh we're live
99:02 - on our new domain yeah it was amazing
99:04 - it's a brave new world yeah
99:06 - cool
99:07 - thank you thanks yeah yeah yeah pleasure
99:10 - gentlemen i'll see you downstairs all
99:12 - right sounds good thank you yeah
99:17 - all right
99:18 - well
99:19 - we've had very in-depth talks with seven
99:22 - different teams and uh we are going to
99:25 - discuss among ourselves uh the judging
99:28 - team i just want to give a final shout
99:30 - out
99:31 - netlify
99:32 - for everything they're doing
99:34 - for providing the fundamental technology
99:36 - that this entire hackathon has run on uh
99:39 - thank you so much matt for your
99:41 - sponsorship and for being on the judging
99:43 - panel thanks
99:45 - thank you chris and everything you all
99:47 - are doing over at fauna we're very
99:48 - excited about it we're interested in
99:50 - exploring it ourselves and free cooking
99:53 - thank you so much cole you're an
99:55 - incredible interviewee we're going to
99:57 - post that interview with coal later
99:59 - thanks to forms for you for sponsoring
100:02 - and uh everybody who's watching have a
100:04 - beautiful evening and keep jamming
100:09 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone welcome to the top six i'm quincy larson with free code camp i am joined by matt billman ceo and cofounder of netlify cole crumport the ceo and cofounder of formsfree and chris anderson the lead developer evangelist for verfana the database so today we are going to be talking with a lot actually seven i said top six but actually we decided to extend it to a seventh one because we were so pulled over by the quality of the submissions we're going to be talking with seven teams of hackathon participants many of whom did not know one another 36 hours ago came together and built some amazing stuff and we're going to see that amazing stuff and we're going to get to the bottom of how they built it and who they are so first we're going to start with caption this and gentlemen perhaps we can start with you just a quick introduction who you are where you're from what you do my name is vijay i'm from new hampshire and i actually am a technician i work for ge aviation so as a technician and i just graduated from the granite state college so yeah that's what i do and i love coding great thank you vijay welcome and uh congratulations on recent graduations thank you great to see you i'm uh david carter um i just moved to san francisco in july and um originally from the antelope valley palmdale lancaster and um right now i work at a wordpress agency and so i'm looking to get more into reaction the jam stack great are you a broncos fan i am a drone how did you guess that hi my name is sumit i'm a qa engineer and i live in sunnyvale california i actually started learning frontend development at free code camp so this is a big day for me and yeah i'm continuing to learn more of frontend like react and other free bugs so yeah i'm really excited thank you so much well perhaps you could go ahead and give us a very quick demonstration of how caption this works all right so caption this is basically going to present you with a random gif so every time you load the page it's going to get a random gif so if you don't like it you can always press this next button and you can choose better gifts and see so you could enter in any caption you want submit it and it's going to add it to our list of submitted gifts and every user could whether or not you submit a gif you can um up vote and we're going to rank all these submissions by votes so the most popular will always be at the top and we've added authentication with netlify right on you've got some pretty cool gifts here too and very good captions for someone what's your favorite so far that you've what what what caption are you most proud of so far um it got deleted actually it got deleted when we added our where do you get the gifts from uh it's uh the api is called the api is called jiffy so yeah that's where you're getting the apps from so where do you stand on the gif versus gif pronunciation everybody who pronounces it gif say ready set everybody who pronounces it jiff say woo actually i like to call it gif so that is a true diplomat great well judges what do you all think so far it's great i really love this one um i think it's fun i think it's kind of a cool i like that you can upvote it and then everyone can see that um so it's it's participatory it's kind of uh it's cool it's a good scope a lot of times hack apps will overscope or underscope and it's hard to be impressive like that but it's impressive to bring it mostly to completion because you picked the right scope yeah yeah i would certainly uh share that opinion i've seen so many hackathon projects that are extremely ambitious and then they have to pair back all their ambitions right before the demo time but it looks like this is something that was definitely doable within the time frame and yeah and you all executed great did you have any sort of top things you would have liked to do that there wasn't time from that you had to scope back from or there is a um we wanted to tie voting to user authentication right now we're just storing that with local storage so tying that into the user would have been i think it was nice little good story it's just smart sort of gradual way of getting there you imagine you'll keep hacking on it um maybe i'm into it yeah i'm thinking about it right on and uh what kind of collaborative filtering method are you thinking about are you thinking about like a like reddit or hacker news or some of those other collaborative filtering algorithms and or how are you planning for things to gradually decay and fall off of the top we haven't thought of that actually yeah yeah maybe something like that well i mean there are plenty of models i just wanted to see if you all were thinking about it because you don't want the top loaded thing to always be on the top because it'll you know when it takes off should be fresh stuff yeah we should have some tabs on there so recent ones or pop most popular tabs that you can work on those how did you split up the work between you so he vijay did all the styling stuff yeah all the css and he did all the javascript part and i was there for like adding features sometimes and also for like running around and like we have problems with fauna tv or forms free which we had so talking to those two guys about how do we like go forward uh what should we do and all those things yeah we had great help so we'd like to thank all the judges and help us there during the hackathon process it was really great without them we couldn't even complete this for sure right what have you learned from this hackathon that you didn't know at the beginning about yourself uh for me like uh i was you know as i said i was um coding in a free code camp online thing so i had i never worked as a as a team i never quoted as team so it's really a different experience i believe and i really learned a lot of stuffs and how team you know goes up so i really learned a lot about the teaming thing first the first most thing and about the you know reading documentations that those things were very important and because the apis we used here and the databases we use they were completely new for us but uh you know the the judges they showed us where to go for the technical documentation so we just rate that and i think because of that so yeah we learned a lot actually probably the collaboration skills working with people in different skill sets and learning to divide the work so everyone works to their advantages we didn't know each other before these hackathons until yesterday we didn't know each other i'm from new hampshire all the way from new hampshire and yeah so we just made a team and boom are there other apps you almost built uh no we didn't even have an idea for this is gonna spur at the moment at what point did you start shift from like idea and conceptualization and building your team like at what hour of yesterday would you say you actually sat down and started coding probably after lunch yeah just after my chest right any other questions what was the hardest thing you had to solve while building this the login um because we just had limited time the last hour yeah and then incrementing the votes yeah incrementing the votes learning how to like we had to read and write and yeah yeah talk to hona devi like how would you do god yeah well great thank you so much for coming up here and for demoing pleasure meeting you through gentlemen and i'm very impressed with what you've done here yeah great girl thank you thank you nice to meet you just let me know when the audio is back it's back okay great yeah so while wall hacks piece coming up here go ahead and get situated i just want to take a moment to uh recognize some of you are going to need to stand be careful that white stuff and it's not like a skate park all right so i just want to take a moment to acknowledge uh one of the biggest sponsors of the event i guess uh maybe the biggest adventure but netlify is such a an amazing supporter of the developer community and they're really pushing forward with a lot of technology that's going to make the internet faster and safer and make it easier for organizations to scale their website so matt billman from netlify is a visionary and i'm very excited personally to see where where he goes and where netlify goes in the coming years so thanks again for your support thanks thanks for having me here and thanks for helping bring all of this on and driving it forward and for building free code camp i think everything we do is about helping developers build things so being at a place and seeing hundreds of developers building things with our thing is really exciting and on the note of people building things using netlify let's talk to haxby how are you great yeah yeah you're doing great yeah well i hope we started starting with this gentleman we'll just go uh i guess in clockwise order yeah we'll do it clockwise we're gonna go like this why not we got we've got two dimensions here yeah uh and just tell us your name where you're from and what what you're doing with your time these days all right well my name is robert wolf i'm originally from europe but i'm taking my extra semester here studying ux design but i also like the code and when i discovered jamstag about a year ago i saw one of the three first keynotes i was so excited was like telling all my friends stop doing what you're doing start doing the new way and i'm so happy to be here today where it actually kind of have grown and i feel like there's a lot of people around doing the same thing great yeah hi i'm anil i am working a software developer here in bay area and i have i'm really excited about the react stuff and all then i got to know about the gatsby stuff and i have built some kind of local projects with me and then i got to know more about the jam stack and it was really exciting so i want to know who out there is working on that and i got to know about this hackathon it's pretty good environment out here yeah hold on so my name is kyle smith and i'm a student at csu stanislaus a computer science student and uh yeah just started learning about web technologies when i was in high school and found out about jam stack about like a few months ago and it was just so easy to grasp and just been interested ever since great my name is manuel and i'm a computer science student in cabrillo based in santa cruz and honestly i don't remember how i came across free code camp but i came across it thankfully and i've been programming ever since great i'm ryan weimer i live here in oakland in the bay area i actually work as a project slash account manager so i like these kind of opportunities because i've never done a hackathon before but i thought it would be awesome to get my hands dirty in the code and i really like the jam stack i've built a number of you know personal websites with it and it's such a contrast from like the monolithic things that i'm used to in the enterprise world you know doing it for a big client it's really refreshing to do something like this for the jam stack yeah well uh ryan it looks like you're at the helm yeah let me know if we can uh get this display so is it plugged in it is plugged you have to unplug it and plug it in again okay that's how they fixed the hubble the other day classical yeah hdmi intel oh into the back of the usb dongle yeah oh that would probably help conspicuously sitting there [Laughter] all right here we go okay this is big screen here we go let's make that full screen nice awesome so robert as you already know our name is haxby we're on the hackathon using gatsby um this is the problem we're selling if you ever learn the language with a language app you know it's a terribly boring and kind of weird process usually let's stare at the pictures of people you've never seen before and try to attach your basic vocabulary to the pictures it doesn't really work i've tried to learn a language with many different apps i've never succeeded so when we came here together in the hackathon we thought we're gonna make something better we're gonna approach learning a language differently and what we realized is that it's all about you right what makes the learning language easier if is if you can relate if your brain can associate things with it so we wanted to make something relatable and also fun and that's why we created ulingual now what ulingual does is it takes your instagram images and teaches you new vocab based on them now this is how our app works so at first we authorized instagram then we take the pictures from the instagram and in real time we pass them through the clarified data to get image recognitions and get an idea about what is it in there now clarify api returns this word the tags of the images in different languages so we pull it out in a different language of the user that he selected and we play a quiz with them that's how we teach them the words now this is how the quiz looks like so you have the word frutto that's for example fruit and italian and you have four pictures from your instagram feed this is my own fear it's embarrassing and you have to select the one that it is and thanks to clarify api being available in 23 different languages we can offer this product in 23 languages very easily so that's exciting now we're going to show you a quick demo about how it actually works all right that's bigger all right so this is the demo that we had showed before so this is a little bit more limited in terms of we wanted to show spanish specifically and again with robert but just to kind of give you an idea and some of these words you know there's obviously room for improvement masculino masculinity could be a lot of these right okay time ran out so that was an example yeah select great one we have a response for a good job beach if i select the wrong one oh sorry incorrect and we're also totaling your score so we kind of have some logic involved with that fruto an example and then basically we give you a score that we total and we give you an ability to tweet out your results um you know i did great on you know my my test in spanish with my own selfies or something yeah we kind of leave it up to the user and how they want to promote it but that's kind of our way of crosspromoting it another cool idea we thought was like this is such a new thing and there's probably all sorts of bugs and ways to improve it we want to give an ability to add some feedback right so using formspree we're able to simply you know add a way to give your name email what's your feedback how can we make our app better so you can send it and and actually send it that's what some dummy data obviously but yeah you get the idea right fork stream makes it really easy um and something that we're really excited about is that's what we were showing before and already we were already kind of hacking away even in the short time we had like let's add some more languages right so we're already doing that let's add german um so we're already working on making that improved so it's just cool that we could do so much more with it so that's an example of german instead of spanish and with my instagram feed there you go very cool so you were able to get instagram integrated or did you see the data so that was the biggest challenge we had we had to say that our api experts can talk about this initially when we thought about the instagram thing right we thought the privacy process will be there and all and we couldn't get the data and all so then we figured out that there is a uh api there out there but the only constraint we faced is that there's a sandbox api which allows only 10 users initially and each user will have only 20 pictures from their feed so that's how we are developing right now but when we have a fullfledged app we can send for the instagram uh access so that uh it can be expanded to an n number of users so that's what we are working on yeah so that's one kind of problem we faced here well the product looks great you've done a good job of just keeping the number of elements to an absolute minimum and it's colorful and big elements so i definitely uh commend your design sensibilities which of you yeah robert and i collaborated this great kind of like pair programming split into the api group and front end it was awesome actually that's worked out pretty great actually the api group and the frontend group so that the task can be divided easily yeah and the integration had some hiccups but yeah yeah it's pretty good what was the planning like did you sit down and think about i mean how did you how did you choose the problem to solve and then how did you set about choosing instagram and machine learning to solve it well so we actually gathered on friday on a discord chat so we didn't have any idea and we started deciding on saturday morning um we were very fascinated with the clarify api we thought well this is such a powerful thing we can do so many things with it at first we thought about helping visually impaired people and then we had this uh idea of languages and it just seemed like a chiffon concept and a lot of things to do with that and by noon we know this is what we're going with how did you select sort of the scope for the app and and where there's some things you felt like ah we really wanted those in but you cut them out actually when we first thought about the app right we thought like many of the kids apps are like this like suppose when you go to school right you'll learn about a fruit or something by seeing to that and you learn the language like that but when we thought about instagram it came out out of the blue and uh then we got in about adults as well and new language as well and that's how yeah we thought this would be more personal to the user rather than using some random images so that's how it came up exactly using instagram was kind of the key idea that makes us excited because everyone loves themselves they love their own pictures they're just gonna be addicted to this game as we are we stop developing and start playing we definitely ran into items with scope right thinking about like project management right you know we ran into lots of cool features that we wanted to so we actually had a whiteboard and wrote down lists like these are problems these are some kind of features and we tried to address the problems before the future features we wanted to add sound that'd be really cool but that's probably lower priority than some of these other ones so it's good to work on it in that way are you all concerned that at some point after playing the game a little bit that you're going to kind of be seeing the same images i mean i have a uh somewhat active instagram feed but probably not more than like maybe like 50 images in there and i can imagine that i won't be able to learn all german actually to be frank unfortunately the instagram is not allowing other public uh users images to be seen so that's one kind of privacy policy they have but other thing is that it can i think it has an endpoint where we can get the data from a specific location by giving gratitude longitude so that might work so that's kind of one of the enhancements we thought about further yeah so you can't like get images from friends or anything exactly unfortunately due to privacy issues this would have been much easier three years ago but it's a little bit more difficult now on the other hand clarify gives us a list of 20 words per image so we could basically if you have three images you can still learn 60 a good words is that extensible can you add like can you teach clarify more more terms and stuff so right now we're just using their general model we haven't really explored in there i hope we could maybe develop our own model based on instagram pictures a lot of food a lot of selfies right yeah that's a good point have you considered maybe uh expanding the functionality by encouraging people to take more photos on instagram and graduate hey maybe you should take a picture of fruit yeah it could also teach you to be a good photographer that way yeah yeah photography projects and language projects yeah all sorts of applications yeah one more thing that's important say for us it's important it's a website not an app because this is something people will go and try out really quickly and that's where the power of gemstock is coming so it opens up instantly and with one click you can start and play yeah we also will save data in the local storage so when the user wizards again they will have their app already open yeah is it mobile friendly is this thing yeah i mean because the design is pretty basic we didn't have to do too much let's see on the quiz itself let's go back to this we did make it somewhat mobile friendly as much as we can you know with a simple design no that's good have you considered talking to language teachers to get feedback on how this could be used how this could be improved so none of us is actually we didn't have personal experience because robert has learned english and other languages so that was good but i'm sure other experts would be helpful yeah well is this something you all are considering pursuing beyond the hackathon i think so yeah yeah it could be fun we came it needs push notifications to remind me it's time to study yeah that's right and to remind you to take the instagram photos of this and when you go to your next country you can talk to your friends in different languages about your instagram feed yeah well i i would encourage you to continue pursuing it i'm not like an expert in human psychology or anything but the vanity angle and the way that the brain works and stuff it may actually be more compelling and form stronger relations if it's something personally related to you that you're associating that word with so um thank you gentlemen for coming in thanks for building this excellent uh application in such a short time it's very impressive and uh yeah we'll we'll look forward to um hearing more about what you do in the coming months and if if you do continue working on this let us know because we'd like to see how it comes along and maybe to go catch up and do a retrospective on it yeah awesome all right thank you thank you thank you for the support here everyone thank you thank you yeah nice meeting you great work all right and next team who's going to come in is going to be make squad i'm very excited about my squad i'm also very excited about what you're doing is thank you so much cole cole again uh ceo and cofounder of performance free cold chromhold and uh thanks for all the guidance you've provided to the many participants here you have truly created a a great developer experience as far as installing forms and forms are a big deal and pretty much every developer has to deal with forms and i'm really excited to hear that you're so rapidly expanding and you've got the api sounds like development is coming along swimming over there the team who couldn't make it here they were working really hard uh up up until like pretty much the last minute and yeah it was great um we got a lot of good stuff done at the end including an entire redesign of the site which uh yeah it was a great forcing function for us to get a lot of stuff done i think now we're going to probably do some cleanup all right well good luck paying down the technical debt here we are with our next very exciting team uh first of all before we get started i just want to say that this was incredibly well presented i think all of us agreed that your delivery was phenomenal so we're looking forward to hearing a little bit more of that donut delivery here but uh make squad let's start let's start with you faith and perhaps you can introduce yourself and then we can kind of go around and clockwise and uh introduce everybody else yeah definitely um so i'm faith um and um i'm a student at make school so hence the name make squad um and yeah so um we have some other people here on the team as well yeah well before before we do uh if you could just tell us like where you're from and aside from being a student at make school like just a little bit about your background sure um so i'm from atlanta um i moved out to san francisco to attend mcschool um right now i'm working on backend web development as my primary concentration um but i was interested in this hackathon because uh the opportunity to work kind of more in the front end and exercise that skill a little bit and i was excited by all of the apis um and i also have an interest in things that have to do with machine learning um and we did employ a little bit of the clarify api in here so that was really fun to work with and to see how that works yeah awesome and tachara yes i'm tashara boucher and i'm from southern california i've been in san francisco for about two years and i came here to do to be a chaplain in the hospital but after my residency year i i guess um wanted to do like a combination of both but tech and the social services so my ultimate goal is to try to have a nonprofit for young adults who've been mentally or physically abused in childhood and to help them with the trade like so the coding and to be able to like put um so that they can have a better lifestyle after having a slump i guess for the years um and so this hackathon is a great experience for me to get experience to network with different people and to meet these wonderful people who are from make school and graciously welcomed me into their team i'm excited awesome i'm edwin and i'm from uh georgia also in make school and i moved here about four months ago um and well i i i worked with coding off and on for like the last 10 years but nothing really serious until i i moved here um but it's always been a passion of mine and i had a lot of fun at this hackathon learning these new technologies great oh i'm jonathan and i'm a full stock developer at make school and i'm from houston texas awesome okay hi i'm stephanie um i'm a junior in med school so i just started a couple months ago in august and i'm from miami i just learned about the opportunity um um i've done also free coop camp like a couple of people here as well and it was great i've also done one hackathon before and it was it was great it was stressful too but there were the end product was great was lovely i i love building products yeah and since you all are from high school perhaps just a quick word about make school because it is a new educational model yeah so it's a new education model um and it is um product uh based learning um so basically instead of attending a lot of long boring lectures and writing stuff on the whiteboard for hours and kind of getting an entrenched in the theory of it we build products throughout the term you build a product at the end of every term we have like our own mini hackathon it's an intensive where you build a product in a week we work on teams we work individually so throughout the time that you attend the program you're building up a portfolio um and so that's why a lot of us were interested in doing this hackathon because we wanted to have another opportunity to build something to yeah to ship it get our idea out there yeah and how long is the program mixed school is two years um and it is a bachelor's program so it's an accelerated bachelor's we have some people who attend for about a year and then they get hired out of the program but it's a two year long program great so at the end of the program you all have a bachelor's degree yeah now it's pretty remarkable so if you're looking for novel higher education models it sounds like this might be worth investigating so um without further ado let's let's jump to the demo you ready yes let's do it yeah so um our app is called network you can leave your business card at home because your face is your business card and so we thought a lot about you know what it feels like sometimes when you're at these networking events especially because the world is full of a lot of emerging technologies sometimes you forget those business cards or it's clunky to kind of like you know waffle with those um and so our idea was to build an app where you can simply take a photo of somebody or you can take a video of them and you can use that video or that photo to retrieve their virtual business card to get back their information so we built kind of a minimum viable product here that demonstrates that idea and we're hoping to have a chance to develop it further in the future but for now we do want to start with the app and so this is the um the business card info you would go ahead and fill in your name your email address your phone number um your state city and state um and then you can fill in your linkedin we would also have twitter which would be an optional field and then another field where you could fill in uh additional information and then you could submit that but before we go to the submission page we also connected a contact form here so for people who for people who have questions for people who have id uh you know ideas for new features or for people who have problems using the app they can um ping us we used forms free to connect the contact form and this form actually does work it does submit and we get the email from that so we could get updated information there yeah you can go ahead and submit it if you want to and then of course we have to put it that we're not a robot i'm not a room full of robots i don't like y'all but i'm kind of a robot just a little bit just a little bit so that went through a couple of submissions from this ip address over there yeah um and then for um you can go ahead and yeah there you go so we got two sides or two ways to um to go ahead and check check out the database you can go to camera um first and you want to go to video first camera okay um and so then you just select the image um so for now we're using the celebrity um model of the api um because it was already hooked up to like a trading model but ideally we would be able to use user photos in the future and it goes to the database we used fauna db for the database and we used clarify for the api that's the celebrity model that we're using here and then it would bring back the person's information we have leonardo dicaprio and we got kanye as our tests great and earlier you you were able to use a phone to demo this could you do that just to show that the image recognition will work from like a another device and then our third celebrity all right do it again one more time all right it worked the demo worked and so there's our app yeah great demo thanks for going through it um questions how did you know that this was the app you wanted to make how did you kind of settle into the idea well we're kind of talking about it right while we're coming into the building on the first day and we like bounce ideas around and we talked more about the ideas once we got in and then decided that this would be a good idea to do at this hackathon how at what point did you start working in this specific idea so when we first started out we um we had been taught that um you actually have to plan first before you start even coding so we didn't start coding until like the middle of the day and so we started with um user stories to try to make sure we we had the app do what it's supposed to do and we had we even used parts of github like on the projects page where you have a kanban board and you can move the um the the cards over once you've been it's been completed so i think that's a good way to plan so that way you can know whether what you're you want to do is actually done yeah and i can testify that we use github projects all the time it's very powerful isn't it satisfying when you can move the cards over it's like crossing it off your list yeah i like that how did y'all organize your work how did you decide like team which teams did that or you know front end back in that kind of thing okay i think we all played um on our streams i know that's like one of the first things that we ask is like what are you good at and we divided it up that way and um we had some very strong and beckons like she said um the make school focuses on back end but they also i guess focus on full stack so really wonderful frontend specialists right here and so just and really everybody just chipping in where you know whether they're slack given or if someone was struggling they moved the top out in any of the areas you all did a great job with the the design yeah um you know it's like you know pink and blue i think they're complimentary colors like if you look at like a color wheel and uh very minimalist design you can see like the little element that kind of flourish up there with the rounded raindrop shapes who did the design well [Laughter] helped me with a lot of the things just making sure it worked and it was cohesive on every single page as well so yeah um yeah we had we had some some ideas about what what we wanted and the way we wanted it to look we did want it to be minimalist so i'm glad you said that but we also wanted i i was really a fan of a lot of color in the background like um so we can market to people who are are networking and starting off in their careers yeah for the modern uh kind of professional yeah it definitely like looks like something that would get acquired by linkedin they had like a card app where you just like took a photo of the card and then it you know yeah and now you can take a picture on that note are you are you all planning to continue working on this after the weekend's over oh if linkedin buys it even if it doesn't take an offer tomorrow morning i think we have a great um kind of i said minimum viable product before and i think it would be good for us to continue development on it so that we can get it hooked up and get users actually in there to make sure that this is something that people would use that people would enjoy using yeah actually we haven't done any user testing so we don't even know if this is this could be good for them you know it could just be a product and it doesn't go anywhere so we have to check our market as well yeah that's very that's a sage observation and uh i can tell you i don't carry business cards and people often ask for them and i just say i don't know your phone i'll email you people being able to go now you'll be able to say my face is my business card all right well thank you again so much uh for coming in and demoing this and building it and it sounds like you all are from all over the u.s congratulations on converging and and forming a team and you know jiving so cohesively yeah it's amazing so yeah thanks again and uh we're looking forward to hearing about how things go at future hacking lawns as well thank you thank you all right cheers thanks hey thank you congratulations thank you thanks for having us okay thank you all right thank you so much for the opportunity yeah all right well uh we're three demos in into our six or seven teams that we're going to talk to four more lifts and at this time i want to talk about chris anderson he is the director of developer evangelism at fauna and i interviewed this guy yesterday and i don't know that i've ever talked to somebody who's worked with so many different types of databases that still looks so young he's definitely got an encyclopedic knowledge of nosql databases and also knows a lot about real world implementation issues and and the tradeoffs associated with different types of databases chris um thank you so much for coming here and inspiring everybody and sharing your knowledge and also uh thanks to to you and fauna for sponsoring this event oh yeah i really enjoy like the little bits of ways to help people get unstuck when they're hacking like to me that's the fun part yeah well um our next team is i'm gonna have to look up your name i'm sorry phoebe and jam yeah that's right all right so uh you all have these nice pasta stickers on what do you think of the household i forgot for a mascot i think it's nice it's got a little uh little character to it yeah you think it's the octacat tier oh it's up there i don't know we need to have like a you know how like uh i think it's like game effect he's has like the character face off and last year like tetris l block one because it's the ultimate hero it saves the day yeah so we should have something like that with mascots and put pit uh octopad versus hospital oh yeah sure absolutely so uh starting with you vince why don't you tell us a little about yourself and we're gonna move in a clockwise since we got two rows here okay yeah okay so my name is vince uh i'm a native san franciscan born and raised and i guess i don't know i'm an aspiring developer you know currently looking for work and uh yeah that's pretty much it hi my name is jin i like gin and tonic like the alcohol i'm also a native san franciscan like vince i'm also kind of using free code camp to learn and try and learn how to program i kind of have backgrounds as this admin but i want to make that leap into the development space and so this is my first hackathon and trying to learn as much as possible all right next my name is brandon stinson i am not a developer i'm currently in the air force i hit 13 years this month just uh trying to learn something new for when i get out so i've got a couple years left and i want to be a developer so i've been learning with free code camp and a couple of the resources and it's my first hackathon awesome yeah my name is reuben um i'm a native san franciscan but i moved when i was four yeah i'm not developer either i'm a mechanical engineer and then i transitioned over to electrical and now i'm trying to transition over to software and so yeah i used uh i still gotta start with free code camp so thank you quincy um but yeah i've just been working on react and it's also my first hackathon it's been just a ton of fun like getting to talk with the sponsors it's cool yeah and uh i'm austin and i yeah i got a degree in chemical engineering decided i wanted to switch to software engineering and so yeah i relied heavily on free codecamp for that and and now i work at human api which is a startup in san mateo and um so i have a open source project you don't know javascript exercises and run a meetup a react meetup in berkeley so wow prolific punch and uh yeah from from varied backgrounds although disproportionately from san francisco yeah from san francisco well tell us a little bit why don't we plug in so we can demo yeah so we'll be able to are we going to use your phone yeah oh there you go wow look at those hands we need to get you a cryogenic freak oh yeah or whatever they're called so yeah so you can go ahead and click on the app so it's uh sick pics we have this little uh so yeah what sick pics is is it's a game for anyone who can anyone can play um so right now so we have this create a game button where you can click and create a game right now there's a button below that says no games available but if there's a game available then anyone can join join a random game that someone else has created and what the game is is once it starts you could have any number of people that have joined that game and you need to take a picture of whatever it tells you to take a picture of and whoever takes that the picture of that thing first wins and it will notify everyone that you won or lost and then it will take you back to the home page so it's kind of like um blazing fast machine learning uh image recognition scavenger hunt um that uh you can play with your friends or anyone throughout the world so um if any of you would like to play yeah all right let's do it all right all right phone's up okay so yeah let's go ahead and create the game elegant uh so it's sicc dash piccs sick dash picks dot netlify.com sig fix on netflix.com and so you can once you get there you can click join a random game no sorry sick picks it's just plc you might consider an easier spelling [Laughter] all right so it looks like we have six players in this game all right are you guys in good to go yeah i'm gonna go ahead and start all right we gotta take a picture of ketchup oh oh that's some high speed turning there i'm not sure why but you have a chance someone could get you in the events this is the fastest iphone [Laughter] big oh who won i lost two maybe i i didn't win i did something wrong [Laughter] hey out there they're in the kitchen they're ready yeah i might have ended up in a oh okay all right let's do it again you guys ready all right let's create that game whoa yeah i think you may have a good game on your hands all right pretty quick there's definitely less phones in here than there are players all right let's do this [Laughter] this is not a picture of ketchup you have to take one that is probably going to surpass the advances all right so yeah um yeah so right now anyone can create a game and when you join a game you just join any kind of random game um so yeah what we tried to do was uh make sure to clear out for the demo and get the game going so but yeah anyone with the the url can just go ahead and create a game and anyone can join and then whoever creates the game has the control to start and so right now what we have in our database as the options are ketchup in a coffee so that we know that we have it um but yeah with the clarify api uh we could add all kinds of things with all kinds of different models so um yeah all right worried that you might uh if you know if you open it up you might end up with you know requests for images in there that might put people in harm's way you know like for example images yeah so the images don't the images are all local so we're not doing anything with the images we're not sending them and the ones in the in our database are just a coffee and a ketchup not like a pickup truck on fire yeah what other kinds of images do you think you'd load in there to kind of expand the scope of the game what other kind of images yeah do you have an example or a thought or so dog dog oh you mean yeah so really it's we're kind of just limit all we're limited by is the clarify api so right now our model we have a model of the food model and we just have ketchup and coffee but yeah we could yeah we could we would control like what's available to be ended yeah for the scavenger hunt yeah and then right now so like all the whole game is is client based in terms of like determining whether you won or not so um which is it's kind of fun with um just the fact that we can have like almost the whole game client side which is kind of a lot of fun yeah what's the obviously it has like a realtime component and certainly what did you use for that um does anyone else wanna answer yeah so we used hasura um so asura is i mean for everyone listening who doesn't know yet uh real time uh it's a graphql api or a backend database that has uh realtime capabilities so that's that's exactly why we chose to build the game you know because that's like one of the primary applications for it um yeah so one of the examples we would sub for example showing the number of people that are in the game you subscribe to uh the users that have a game id of the game that you you just created or the game that you're a part of and so um yeah any time that the postgres database changes you automatically get those those changes yeah whenever someone wins we're just like we said the game is completely client based so whenever someone updates the state you know and reacts that they won we just update that in the database so none of like no one's going to take a picture some weird and put and push toward database yeah right yeah so and then we also subscribe to the status of the game so if when it's pending and someone pushes start the game then it will update for everyone the fact that it's um started in progress and then when someone wins it updates to say that the game is finished and who the the winner was so um yeah we could we could expand to you know have user names or or names or also like you can choose which game that you want to join perhaps um yeah a lot of different ways we could expand up that way how was the development process like i guess how did you decide what you're going to build so we started yeah we started i think we i think we had um the apis in mind already like clarify and asura like they had like we just kind of thought about the possibilities and so um we decided again because i mean it's fun to make games right and like also um when you make something that's like something no one here has ever done something exactly like this before right and so we're all thinking creatively and everything and so it helped us i mean it pushed us you know what i mean so that's like one of the reasons we picked it and um but as far as the development process we started off with we initially started off with the gatsby um because um the graphql implementation there is relatively easy to use and the development screen is pretty fast but we ran into several problems um one being that graspy does get gatsby doesn't handle mutations subscriptions anything that's not a query very well and so we switched over to cray racked up and then we're using apollo as clarify api cloud and cloud narrative yeah we're sending our pictures to cloud number and then we're gonna image the url back and then sending that to clarify cool yeah all right well gentlemen thank you for the wonderful demo thanks for answering our many questions very exhaustive answers by the way it's clearly you put a lot of thought into the tools that you chose yeah cool thank you thank you very much thank you thank you thanks awesome pleasures thank you very much thank you you all have fun thanks again i'll see you downstairs this way unless you want to go i'm pretty impressed how are you all feeling yeah it's gonna be a hard decision that's true yeah i think it's really interesting to hear sort of what the process is that people are using and how some teams are really going hard at the beginning at the planning process and kind of making sure that they're building something up front that's going to be useful i think that's cool to i see maybe like society has advanced enough where like you know when i was when i was in getting into the industry i would have done that right yeah a it's a much more mature process that people seem to be undertaking as opposed to just like i think it would be cool to you know have three databases and then try and put them all together using an api that's strictly based on images i don't have any idea what i just said no no we probably don't we didn't even have an api right let's just talk to it we're all just were there days like that i mean i remember getting like floppy disks with shareware too play around with right like because when i was a kid you had to build your own computer where you could start writing code welcome hey colin right got it thanks for watching yes yeah i'm trying to be good with names okay well thank you so much for building this amazing project that vaulted you to what floor are we on like right above us all there is is a roof deck wow yeah it was a catapult right we heard that if we lose you're going to catapult this off the roof we would use it try in keeping with our double dare theme if you bolt it into jello just don't say i don't know all right well welcome it's it's so wonderful to have you both up here uh perhaps you could just tell us a little bit about yourself your background how you all met what brought you here okay so my name is faye yang i flew in from houston on friday houston texas um i started free cocamp about two years ago and because i wanted to learn a little bit more my day job's actually in corporate finance but i see the potential for the future and i would like to be able to work it more into my career my name is colin i live here in oakland currently i maintain a php app for a construction company that's working on the bart extension to san jose on a contract basis i would like to be doing a javascript javascript thing on more of a fulltime basis we met um the day before friday yeah on discord um in the channel to do to me great and i think that's the second team that made it all the way here that had actually met and talked friday night so preparation planning definitely seems to work right yeah okay great well perhaps you could uh go ahead and tell us a little bit about smartypants and uh give us a demo so we're team smartypants tea like the teapot song in final jeopardy um we built this app because every year there's more than 300 000 people who'd like to qualify for the show but only 400 people actually bank it now this means that it's actually harder to get on jeopardy than into harvard i decided on monday that i would like to audition for jeopardy but in looking online i couldn't find any user friendly or modern resources so when we came here this is what we decided to build so when you look at it you're presented with a question the category and the value of the question so in the city of yuma in this state has a record of record average of four thousand fiftyfive hours of sunshine each year any guesses arizona arizona oh sorry what is arizona you don't have to use the what is okay cool so when you type in the correct answer it increases your bank to 200 which was the worth of the i think it's 100 for the worth of the question 200 yeah so then it automatically advances you to the next question now for this one let's say we don't know we don't want to be docked we just hit enter to move on so no change now in this third one we're feeling confident we're going to take a guess any guess we'll take a guess and what we'll find is when it's wrong the answer will show up below but you also lose money in your bank well now that you have the answer you say okay let me type in the answer maybe it'll take it and we can't cheat on this what happens is when you hit enter no points no docking move on we found that this app will solve the real life problem of we can take it on the go it will be mobile friendly and it has the capability to be a pwa powered by gatsby we built smartypants using gatsby so that's react material ui netlify and fauna our first challenge was loading up the fauna database we used the fauna importer command line tool right away this gate was an issue that seems to have something to do with file format even though our json data validated just fine deba at fauna was super helpful he was kind enough to actually go on their internal slack channel and follow up seek help and follow up with me in an email it turned out what we needed was just a single flag on the command line i was just missing an option once we had that option it worked fine we loaded up 610 sample questions that's 10 shows worth out of our total set of 200 000 real world historic jeopardy questions that we've downloaded the next step was to wire up that fauna database to netlify using netlify's lambda function service this gave us three issues first of all in terms of development production parity we had to run a server to run the functions in development whereas in production they're on the same domain so then proxying to that server in gatsby it eluded us at first the second thing the toml file format gave us some issues we were putting sensitive data in there we were putting api keys in there and so we didn't want to version control it so then we were like how do we get that on netlify remove the api keys and use netlify's interface for environment variables like heroku um and the third thing was that gatsby and building on the back end didn't have access to window.fetch so we eventually figured out that we needed a fetch polyfill um in all of these i have to get a give a huge shout out to sean at netlify who was super generous and super patient he basically sat with us and paired with us through all of these problems he seems to like share our stoke at every success point on all of these in resolving all of these issues and a couple more really it was about simplified the simplest possible use case and console log that's something that i would say to other free code camp learners especially people who are just starting out simplify simplify simplify and then get some output as soon as possible console log it overall our biggest sticking point was wiring up all these apis together i spent all day yesterday and an hour of this morning just getting these various apis to work together and to get a build that would deploy um so that took away a lot of time from actually building ui from actually building react components now that i've done it once though i would definitely go back i would definitely use netlify and this host of services again so for future applications for the jeopardy specific we want to add more gameplay options but i think we have an opportunity to also use this as a framework so i used to teach english to um elderly iranian immigrants who were trying to qualify for citizenship so you could take this this framework all you need is your own fauna key and an appropriately formatted set of questions in json format and you could upload those to your own fauna database and then you could make something like a citizenship quiz app that you could take on the go use at home at work on the bus etc great first of all it sounds like you all learned quite a bit for sure do you have um like ideas about i don't know um opening it up to be a multiplayer contest or uh end users can submit new questions or that kind of thing um for end users submitting questions if we're connecting to the jeopardy historic database i think maybe not but for their expansion uh with using different frameworks yes in terms of other players we toured with the idea of doing user authentication with profile with stats to strengthen categories a leaderboard but with the limited amount of time that we had this weekend we've opened up an own issue in our repo to work on it in the future i would definitely say that user identities and persisting data would be one of our next steps so it was i mean i think one of the things everybody here loved like liked about this app was that you scoped it very well so you can easily see adding that in the future right but starting out with building something that in itself works and gives the idea before worrying about that it's a really good approach thank you thanks yeah the core gameplay is there are some other things that you did early on to kind of try and scope the project or divide up the work or do the planning before you actually started writing code drew it out about how we want the basic ui to look at potential gameplay formats that we would pick a couple and then how we would maybe do users and how we'd split it up so ui ux react and then more of the back end linking up the different apis and from our very first contact i would say we immediately started talking about what mvp looked like what our literal minimal scope looked like and then actually we have a teammate who can't be here because he's at work he so i said it took away time from working on the ui he actually was working on like basic ui without being wired up to any back end yesterday while we were doing the api wire up stuff so so you were able to work in tandem and not block one another totally yeah synchronously all right do you have any other questions for colin faye straight up would you keep uh working on it afterwards or did we already hit that like are you thinking about experience sure yeah we have like at least two or three issues that aren't very far off for us that i think we could get to really quickly and i would say um when people look for jobs after free code camp they say build your portfolio don't just build what's on the coursework build what's your passion project and i think i found mine in this one nice great and uh just one last question when are you planning to apply to uh to be on jeopardy i don't know i have a lot of studying but first i need to build this app then i'll study with the app all right great well thank you so much it's been a pleasure thanks good to see you again wow a lot of games tonight yeah yeah yeah it seems like a popular way to uh make something cool for a hackathon absolutely and pretty exciting to again like if you're doing a game that single player experience the first thing you feel when you pick the game up matters so much to the success of the game yeah so like they did you can scope your app and leave out like so much of the hard heavy lift and still get your gameplay done yeah yeah and what's the first game that any of you created did you ever i mean everyone's had to create a game at some point like the first has always been like the tutorial doing the kissing kiss and number games yeah that has to be like the first one i created like a star trek next generation quiz game i don't know about first but like high pressure was like uh somehow i didn't know that i was gonna have like a whole bunch of people who were you know from overseas in my office like learning the technology and that morning so i woke up and got to work and here's all these people and they don't really speak english and they need to learn nosql and so i i've got the monitor up with my editor and i was like let's make a game nice nice yeah i also ended up making a game yesterday oh yeah and live stream all right well next up uh we have the this jam fizzy jam yeah thank you busy jam and uh so so thrilled to have you all here very impressed with your application we can't wait to see it but we can wait because first we want to learn a little bit about you all we'll start here with zubin and then we'll go in clockwise order can i answer real quick what was it about a project that impressed you first so many things so many things yeah but several things yes it's a very impressive application and uh you know just you know the animation but i won't i won't i'll wait i'll restrain myself so before i wax poetically about your app i'll let the rest of the world see it zoom in take it away hey um my name is zubin um i'm actually from melbourne australia i was here at work and um i reached out to quincy got a ticket because i really wanted to be part of this i'm a free curriculum student in fact free code camps that have rescued me from from deep depression because i couldn't figure out how to code before if we could get like i'd given up twice and then thanks for please go camp um i really got back on and it's been upwards since so really excited to use my skills here awesome welcome welcome to the states i love it here great i'm sean i was born and raised in the bay um i was originally in i.t and i since left my job to pursue learning code full time and i've been doing it about a year now and this is my first hackathon so excited to learn hi my name is ilan i'm originally from colombia i've been in the bay area for about five years and i'm a frontend developer and i love the idea of jumpstart so i'm very thrilled to be here until the end my name is juan i'm from massachusetts and i'm currently a student at rhythm school yeah let's go to school my name is sarah i just moved to san francisco a couple months ago to also attend rhythm school and this was my first hackathon so it's great to be here i learned a lot great yeah my name is david lau and i'm a free cocamp student and i just i've been going through the curriculum the full stack the new full stack web development curriculum and uh i learned so much going through this project uh that you wouldn't learn by yourself because it's just a completely different setting i mean you think you know everything already but once you work with other people you don't know is my language but no it's great to work with other people with different backgrounds and you need to like just work with other people you think like you think you know it all but you don't you can always work with more people and yeah i love these guys great well word to the audience come to hackathons put yourself out there get experience working with a team all right so let's see it all right you ready cool yeah all right so i'll quickly introduce busy jam so um we like to think of easy jam as it's time to do to forget about pokemon capture data instead you know when you when you come to a hackathon there's a real problem with invisible data you know who's who's there what level of experience do they have do they need to team members or not how do they find team members and then there's a problem for actual organizers and the uh you know the product managers and others who run the sponsorship side of things right so the api and things like that all the apis available who's using it whether they had an easy time or not such an easy time using why did they choose to use it this is all really valuable information from the organizational point of view so eventually what we're going to make busy jam do is also be a matchmaking service for attendees and at the same time provide really high quality data to organizers and the and the sponsors um when we got together we realized um it was such a pain because none of us actually knew each other it was hard to find team members and that right away was an immediate you know problem that we wanted to try and solve that's where this started and then we said before we start building or writing and code let's actually validate this so we went and had a whole bunch of interviews spoke to a bunch of people interviewed each other and others who had attended identified the basic problem statement then started prioritizing what we wanted to build researched the apis built it you know it was a great experience uh and so what visijam does now as you can see it's it's a pretty straightforward dashboard we've got all that is realtime data and so we've used gatsby and netlify of course we also use formspree so that's actually real data from attendees at this um at this hackathon so david if you want to go to the entry form um so that's actually we can actually start bunching in data right now and david will do that as i speak but it asks a bunch of questions um and you can see that it'll update so when we go back to the dashboard you will see for example if david were to say that he's now very experienced in java it'll show that there was another person who's increased his you know level of experience and let's say java um we can add stuff fairly quickly to this that also talks about what uh what apis they use right now we're using form spree for the actual form um and we're also using phone streams backend with an api endpoint from where we can retrieve the data we're using um netlify to actually run the continuous deployment um and you know the netlife login page is also possible but that makes sense only once we have a proper user data model and stuff like that um right now you can see that when he's when he submits it it'll say okay um what i want is i don't want i want the viewer to be able to see that i made a change in the data so what i'm going to do is i need to make another tab and because i don't want it like dummy data so so so that when i do something actually the change is reflected so right now the percentage of mail you can see is gender 6624 so once i enter my form data it should theoretically increase 66.2 by whatever one of whatever is the total so as long as larger than that so we will know it's different 66 point yeah so go to this actually doesn't work it goes to the yeah you can go back to the video yes go back to that yeah i'll go back to the bookmark so mail was 66.2 it's 66.7 so there was a difference so we can see that there's a change in the data yeah and what we did was we had members of our team walk up to other attendees and personally deliver this kind of survey conduct the kind of survey ask them these questions some of us ask them questions i just gave them the links like hey can you could you do this for us and you know yeah you're nice yeah they'll say yeah of course why not it's just a couple minutes just fill out a simple form but yeah the root problem as zubin uh mentioned was when we all came in we didn't know who who each other are and we could use this data to if we had this data beforehand we would know better about our other attendees oh you work with javascript i work with javascript too it's just easier way to know who each other are it would have been helpful if we had this before but we made it now we can use this for future hackathons anything we can expand it to wherever we want but we can do that all in two days so we just did what we could the basic one of our users actually had a really cool suggestion they're like you know we've done two or three of the attack accounts before but we don't have a profile that says that um with the link to the hackathon then i actually thought that's actually a fantastic idea let's talk about you know user generated product development right somebody actually okay so you know if um david's done three hackathons these are the dates this you know this is the link it's a great platform for hackathons to advertise their hack accounts as well yeah and the products that could be like there's so much stuff we could use and unlike other you know we wanted to be careful not to make it a trivial custodial application we want to make it something that could prove that the apis were also capable of supporting a b2b use case which i think is really important from a monetization point of view for the api certainly so we said okay if this was a serious product could it actually you know could the apis actually support it and they absolutely can so that's great excellent thank you for the demo it's questions have you thought about how to get the word out to me this is like tailor made for uh press releases and having magazines right here i'm enough to get on a live stream i don't know if you have any ideas on how you can do that but that would be awesome um but yeah we can always make it we can always make it better i know it looks kind of uh it looks simple right now but we can make it like more interactive uh so that once you enter like once you enter your data you can know exactly like you'll animate so you can see the change in difference of the data so it doesn't look like i have to refresh the page uh but yeah let's we can look over the data and this kind of data could be interesting to a data scientist who studies data i don't think any we none of us had kind of background data scientists but i've heard of what they do i mean i know what their role is it's different than us we're doing development we make the structure we use the structure and build up the product but to this a data scientist they could see oh you know this uh this event had many attendees who had program who had experience with javascript right like 20 beginners 18 38 intermediate and 5 advanced and not many not many ruby developers so probably not many too many who develop on ruby most kicks just jumping actually because that's an interesting question do you guys how would you guys want to use this because you know we've asked a lot of the participants we haven't had a chance to ask people who actually produce the apis and the management how would you like to use something like this so how would you see this be useful well you mentioned a little bit matchmaking which would you know you need to go deeper so you'd model the individual correct there's an individual uh you know who fills out the survey yeah yeah that was a feature that we talked about in our planning process um but you know we were thinking about what's our minimum viable product in a twoday period it was kind of on the wish list yeah yeah we had to be really strict about prioritizing but you know that's the perfect sort of thing for a graph you are kind of you know back in it would be awesome yeah any other ideas at what point did you guys all decide like this is what we're going to build instead of building i think we had like this basic concept um pretty quickly like within five minutes of discussing our plan yeah um and then we kind of had a sort of like spider web conversation of like what about these features we made a list um and then probably took another 20 minutes to really narrow down like this is our minimum viable product and i think one of the big challenges we faced is um even when we were starting out we started out with a static json file that we were loading the data from and then we wanted to transition to the live update that hits the api so a lot of us are really new to git and so um having kind of different branches where we were experimenting with different things um created submerged conflicts so it was actually great to have the opportunity to kind of work through that together no you you asked how it the idea started right it it actually uh started uh when we all sat down and we had the brainstorming idea and uh elon he just threw it out there say you know we should we should start asking people around i mean he had he had the initiative to just bring it up and we were all listening we were thinking if it's a good idea we thought about it and we said yeah let's just let's do it yeah i have to definitely commend your execution because it takes i can speak from experience having built projects where you go around and you ask everybody back upon do something it takes a lot of uh work and a lot of courage to approach your peers and stick an ipad in their hand or however you were going about doing it so yeah it's really impressive you might scroll down just a little bit to the years of coding so according to typeform which is what we use to collect uh data for advent giving up the tickets the tickets were free but you had to go through this tutorial this jam stack tutorial i created uh and one of the questions was how long you've been coding and uh the median number of months was 16 16 months coding which is right there yeah so this is where yeah so it's between one and two years so yeah that's exactly right that's the representation that's distribution just between 12 and 20. yeah yeah so it's pretty cool that uh your data is so representative as my data which was like a thousand data points yeah that's great yeah it shows like yeah there's a wide range of experience and uh yeah there's something that works less than six months so you know if you're attending someone maybe your experience and you want to group up with someone uh experience as well so you know you know you guys can get started real quick right away maybe you know you want to grow up with someone with less experience so you can mentor them that's a possibility too if you knew if people who signed up had less experience you could link them up with the people who are looking for people looking for and i think also like in just promoting you know future hackathons you know for me this was my first hackathon and i was kind of wondering whether i should sign up or not am i going to be ready um and so seeing you know that oh in the last hackathon there were people who had less than six months of coding experience um could be a way to make you know more people feel comfortable in the future were there questions you wanted to put in but left out because you didn't have too many questions absolutely i mean we wanted to actually talk about stuff like we'll you know hopefully we were thinking if we could collect the data fairly close to the end but we knew that's a high pressure time everyone's going to just tell us to take a hike right but the idea was you know which of the apis you use and actually just have a chat but like we've got the form widget i just haven't productionized that that bit because you know we didn't want to add that um there were a couple of questions like that how many have you done before and stuff like that so we just wanted to prioritize what we know people would be happy to share very quickly it takes less than 30 seconds to collect the data when we went out but ahead um that kind of stuff yeah yeah and as part of the ideation process we talked about if we wanted to be more individual contributor like a member or someone attending uh focused or uh like uh sponsor focus right so with once we decide on that we were also able to kind of parse through the questions and be like okay this is something more that like netlify would want to know right this is more something someone like me sarah or elon would want to know so we did that as well well i'm very impressed with this and i could definitely see this as being kind of like one of the major components of essentially a larger open source hackathon toolkit that hackathon organizers could use and one of the things we built over the weekend at freecodecamp was that leaderboard we called it the project index because it wasn't actually a leaderboard but it you know this plus that which is open source i think they put the mit license on it um and all these other uh tools that we could potentially come up with you know we could potentially have like a whole suite when you want to have a hackathon clone this repo yeah get started right license as well yeah quincy actually i want to bring this up we did was actually something you did earlier earlier simpler uh uh before like this year which was like a uh every time you sign up to sign into freecodecampage there's a survey a link with the header it says click here we're we're doing a mass survey of all the uh developers please spend give us five minutes that's that's exactly what we did we asked people you know their background just demographic information that's just what you did and then we we just brought alive to the to the to the tendons the locationality of it uh and the temporality of it are definitely an interesting uh aspect and what uh what dave is referencing is the 2018 new coder survey which we interviewed 30 000 people uh we had them all fill out a survey we're currently crunching those numbers but we're gonna release that as a giant public data set hopefully in a month or so and you know people are interested in that data right we're going to get it out there yeah hey oh thank you so much thank you thanks everybody david thank you sarah juan elon sean you all are great you've done some amazing work here and uh thanks again i hope you'll stick around and eat some food get some drinks you guys talk downstairs thank you thanks very much thank you thank you all right and i think we have anybody need to go to the bathroom hang in there four five six seven team number seven where in the world they should be coming in that's my resume if you didn't hear me yeah it's a shame you have got some uh yeah there you go yeah i respect it all right welcome thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you for waiting in the hall it is uh thrilling to introduce you all we were very impressed with your application we can't wait to see it before we do let's go around and talk about each of you and your background and what drew you to this hackathon we'll start with you sure my name is tatis i i've been a full stack develop web developer for a few years but recently uh left my company to go to work on a jam stack app a business built around a jam stag app of my own so that's what i'm doing right now and i'm here because jamstack drew me the the conference jimmy to to san francisco and wanted to stick around for the hackathon as well so i'm jeff i am a freelance web developer i've been working for about seven eight years at various contracts and i've been really uh into the jam stack because i love working on the front end part of things and i like working on the interface and what you see and you know if i can have apis take care of the back end it's great so i i wanted to meet more people that are all about that kind of stack and see where i can go with it so yeah great my name is gabe greenfield i'm a frontend developer i work at frontier airlines in denver colorado um and yeah i'm drawn to the jams tech as another you know front end developer looking to outsource some of that back end work so that i can do what i love and make apps really quick that are fun cool exciting and really powerful so uh yeah my name is tyler vick i live in columbus ohio i am an aerospace engineer turned data scientist turned web developer and i've been using netlify in my freelance work and i couldn't miss the chance to come to a sponsored jam stack conference and hackathon sounds like you all have a lot of jam stack experience between the four of you it's awesome uh jeff you want to take it away with the demo yeah so um well i guess yeah we're team where in the world and we are going to be doing a live game show with everybody watching so if you're watching please join in check there's a link on the discord before you can go to uh whitworld.live yes we bought a domain don't worry it's hosted on netlify please join that link and so we're going to get started here but uh and you and if you know if it's taking you a minute you can join in the middle it's fine so you just go here um put in your your name it's gonna show up on the leaderboard so pick a name that you'll recognize yeah so we'll give them a minute to join now we're in the lobby if you look in the top left there you can see the the player count increasing um live no no need to refresh it'll keep up updating as more players join looks like we've got you might want to drag the window just a little bit yeah is it not yeah hopefully it's right on the screen 18. wow yeah great all right so now we can full team i think we're about ready let's kick it off we're gonna we're gonna kick it we're using a little netify function with our we might play a couple back again there's gonna be an image and then there's a map okay you wanna pick like point a pin on the map where you think that image is that's basically it where in the world the image is all right are you ready kick it off here okay let's do it so now everyone sees this and if it you know the mobile should see uh the images the map below the image and if you're on a desktop you'll see you can see where i'm guessing so now [Laughter] now jeff has guessed he's submitted everyone else is getting their submissions in and as everyone else is guessing we're going to see them pop up live here uh wherever everyone thinks it is and then you also if you make the screen a little smaller we can see the scores on the right as well oh yeah don't forget to hit submit because if you don't hit submit you just won't get uh you just won't get the uh we won't record your submit your your yes what happened there but uh don't worry we run it again we can run another game in a second here but you can see the scores are popping up there on the right um as as everyone's done and the game is over right yeah the game is over it's you get 30 seconds and uh that was that's the game so we can play let's do another one do another one for those of you who missed might have had anything unclear with the instructions so play again pops up you should have a button up here yeah or in your mobile app somewhere click play again on top to play again so now we'll be in the waiting room oh man we got 21 now getting up there yeah just gonna feel the pressure random all right ready to play another one let's do it all right here we go we're live where in the world jeff middle of the united states i don't think there's any water there jeff colorado maybe oh maybe [Laughter] we've got oh everyone's so far away what's we're all over the place here what's going on oh someone's in idaho lots of california san francisco is that the yeah could that be the golden gate bridge it looks like a golden gate bridge is it oh but i don't know some people are all right and i was very far off but now later on all right good job right on the mark all right yeah so that that's our demo and we'll pull up our little acknowledgement slide here we jammed a lot together into this little app here but uh we can run through this asura was very instrumental in that we were making use of graphql subscriptions and it made it really easy to set those up like the websocket endpoint that they automatically generated for us and i made that really easy netlify we obviously deployed on netlife and then also used a lot of netlife functions so that's uh when when we're when we're waiting to get the game started we have a little like on our github readme we set up a little admin panel that makes it easy to just start a game with different uh with different images that we have lined up uh curated to go and then on the bottom we have all the little pieces the little moving pieces that uh help make it happen so it's a it's a react app we're using apollo on the client side to do the graphql integration with asura heroku is hosting our asura instance then the google maps api provided the map and the some of the slack and github tooling we used for start development process essentially yeah great good demo how'd you all get together as a team and how did you choose what you were going to build well we all kind of met each other at the conference we were all at the conference and sort of we're mutually connected there and we formed our team yesterday morning at breakfast and threw out some ideas and we just chose one shortly after the keynote and went with it yeah we were we kind of the way we described what we honed in on is uh that we wanted to do two things we wanted to show the power show the show the power of the jam stack and also show people the world that was the kind of nice how uh what was kind of the develop i guess the like product development process like did you uh you know did you do any drawings did you kind of like do any i don't know case uh user study kind of thing or anything like that or did you just dive right into write code we did some uh like data modeling we had i brought in a little mini white board with this guy uh so we did some data modeling so that way we could have like some sample data in our database um and it was really good for just kind of driving a discussion of like oh like we didn't think about this concept the same way so then we were able to kind of bridge those gaps before we started writing a single line of code or thinking of a single mock yeah and then we split up like someone working on the data setting up the database and then working on the front end we decided to do a pair programming because we didn't want to like too much confusion and we could just put two minds in onto one computer and that worked really well i think that was yeah yeah because especially like there were moments where like oh like somebody was really honed in on something needed to get something done maybe we were you know a few like an hour before or some deadline and then but because we programmed most of it we were always able to rely on some other person who knew each piece of the like all these different pieces that were working together so we could always have like kind of like a fallback plan in case like the person who had actually been doing the driving wasn't available at the moment yeah what features um are you know just outside of scope that you would add if you had more time the two big ones that we had had in mind were the ability for users to kind of like facilitate these games in the sense that like uploading the photos um you know we think we one of our inspirations was trivia hq so we like the concept of having one game going on but it'd be nice if kind of with our show the world kind of mission uh if users could like say like i you know i really i think this place is really cool and i want more people to know about it let me submit a photo of that place and let's play a game about it and then the other one is kind of have like a different uh potentially like different localizations for the games so like everyone can play a world game but if we were to like say let's play like a san francisco kind of game then there would be like the like level of granularity at which the photos would come in and that people could play would be only relevant to people who like really know the area so then just kind of like different levels of localization would be interesting as well yeah yeah that's i could see this being really popular my parents love that trivia hq game and they always play together and i could definitely see this being like a community thing like san francisco has so many distinctive landmarks and even little benches that people might be able to recognize you know yeah for sure we thought long term maybe we could introduce training of machine learning on some of these images um maybe do like a what in the world app where you could look at certain things and see what those things are but yeah that's kind of a far goal yeah all right well thank you so much for coming in and giving this awesome demo thanks for coming out yeah i'm building this it's you've used a lot of different tools yeah i'm just uh i think it's always awesome when something is is scoped just right so you can actually like really end up with it with a working demo and a live domain and launch something to the world in the weekend yeah i think to be honest like with all the tools it makes that easier like i'm surprised that in two days we could do this but i think like all of these tools number five sort of react i mean it's like yeah pretty cool i think i would have spent a half a hackathon just putting up a website when i was a full stack web developer and now i was like not the fight buy domain deploy oh we're live on our new domain yeah it was amazing it's a brave new world yeah cool thank you thanks yeah yeah yeah pleasure gentlemen i'll see you downstairs all right sounds good thank you yeah all right well we've had very indepth talks with seven different teams and uh we are going to discuss among ourselves uh the judging team i just want to give a final shout out netlify for everything they're doing for providing the fundamental technology that this entire hackathon has run on uh thank you so much matt for your sponsorship and for being on the judging panel thanks thank you chris and everything you all are doing over at fauna we're very excited about it we're interested in exploring it ourselves and free cooking thank you so much cole you're an incredible interviewee we're going to post that interview with coal later thanks to forms for you for sponsoring and uh everybody who's watching have a beautiful evening and keep jamming
