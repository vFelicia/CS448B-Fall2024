With timestamps:

00:03 - hey everybody its Jesse and I hope
00:07 - everyone had a nice weekend and I had I
00:13 - actually did a lot of coding this
00:15 - weekend but not for this project for
00:19 - just a side project for that Udacity
00:22 - course that I'm taking so I wanted to
00:27 - start out by just acknowledging Andrew
00:30 - for his commits so these are all the
00:36 - people who have submitted pull requests
00:39 - to this project appreciate everyone
00:44 - contributing and in this way and I
00:47 - appreciate everyone contributing in the
00:48 - live chat as well in the comments and
00:51 - you all made this project so much better
00:54 - than it would have been if it were just
00:56 - me working on it
00:57 - so anyway Andrew thank you for that and
01:00 - Andrew also had some great ideas to
01:03 - improve the the search function for the
01:07 - resources so I took his ideas and made
01:11 - an issue now I I fully intend to you
01:17 - know do this issue myself at some point
01:19 - but if anybody is interested in this and
01:24 - would like to contribute to a project
01:26 - then this one's up for grabs right now
01:29 - and if you want to learn about you know
01:34 - debouncing then this might be a good one
01:37 - too to start out with alright and I
01:42 - actually had something cool happen right
01:46 - before the stream started and I had like
01:50 - I don't know like ten people waiting and
01:53 - I already had three thumbs up and I
01:55 - hadn't even started yet that was really
01:57 - awesome I don't know if anyone was
01:59 - watching there was one time where I had
02:01 - I had a thumbs down I don't know like
02:04 - ten minutes before I even started and I
02:06 - thought that was hilarious
02:07 - so now that made up for it cuz I had
02:09 - three thumbs up before I even started
02:12 - I appreciate that all right so today I'm
02:19 - gonna be working on this page so I don't
02:25 - know if you've seen this before you
02:26 - might have seen this before cuz I did
02:28 - this a while ago like weeks ago but I
02:32 - never really finished it so right now
02:34 - you can get to it so you can actually go
02:37 - to the live website and if you just type
02:39 - in slash news you can get to it if you
02:43 - click the news button it actually just
02:44 - takes you to the front page and then
02:46 - Scrolls you down there's a news anchor
02:48 - tag to the bottom but this is is
02:52 - actually live it's just not obvious on
02:55 - how to get to it but this is going to
02:58 - end up functioning exactly like a normal
03:01 - blog would function but they're just
03:03 - calling it news so it's basically just
03:08 - gonna display posts and we're gonna have
03:11 - categories and tags and archive so all
03:14 - of this was just hard coded in but
03:17 - what's gonna need to happen is it's
03:18 - gonna need to pull categories tags and
03:21 - tags from WordPress and populate these
03:26 - fields and then we're gonna have to hook
03:29 - this up so that you know when you click
03:30 - one of these it actually changes what
03:33 - appears here the archives will probably
03:38 - have to do I'm not exactly sure left
03:43 - you'll have to figure out something
03:44 - because I can't just I don't think I can
03:46 - just get an API you'll call back to have
03:52 - you know archives I suppose I could make
03:54 - one with a date range that's probably
03:58 - what's gonna happen I think you can make
03:59 - a call to WordPress to get posts within
04:01 - a certain date range that's probably
04:05 - what's gonna happen I mean right now I
04:07 - could grab all the posts immediately and
04:09 - just have filters but eventually if
04:12 - there's a lot of posts then it wouldn't
04:14 - make sense to get every post so it's
04:17 - probably better just to make these be
04:20 - separate API calls and at some point it
04:24 - would be good to set
04:25 - up cashing of API calls because you know
04:35 - people just clicked around back and
04:37 - forth it could end up being a lot so I'd
04:40 - like to have some client-side caching
04:42 - setup as well but probably not gonna get
04:46 - that done today today I think we'll just
04:49 - focus on you know maybe the UI for how
04:55 - these appear and you know possibly
04:57 - getting some categories maybe tags
04:59 - linked up I need to put an image or
05:03 - something up here as well but I'm not
05:06 - worried about that we can just throw in
05:08 - any image for now just to get the idea
05:09 - of what its gonna look like so that's
05:14 - pretty much it I have done made some
05:16 - updates to the new resource section
05:20 - since the last time not a lot but I've
05:23 - just kind of moved code out so I'll take
05:26 - I'll take a second just to show you that
05:31 - I'd have to check out I just checked out
05:33 - the master branch so I don't have it
05:34 - right now so I'll just explain it to you
05:38 - quickly all I did was just take this new
05:42 - it's gonna be hard to explain sorry I
05:45 - might as well just show you so the
05:51 - branch that I'm working on for the new
05:52 - UI is just a new resource UI if you
05:55 - remember I made that last week
06:02 - all right just to show you so anyway I
06:08 - did just a bit okay so basically I I
06:18 - removed a section that was the featured
06:22 - resources it was a big red section so I
06:25 - did this I'm not like under percent sure
06:27 - about this yet but to have this here I
06:32 - still need to initialize the drop down
06:35 - here so there will be a drop down there
06:37 - just move some things around here these
06:40 - are now their own components in a
06:42 - separate file so I added in some data
06:47 - for authors just to give us an idea and
06:49 - then if there is no author data the
06:51 - author doesn't show up so I took a lot
06:53 - of the suggestions that you all had last
06:56 - week and I've incorporated some of them
06:59 - already and there are others that I'm
07:01 - I'm still going to incorporate I didn't
07:04 - have time before the stream today so
07:08 - that's it not really major changes and
07:12 - I'm gonna go back to the master branch
07:15 - now so that we can get started and let
07:23 - me check oops
07:29 - guess I'll have to fix it all right so
07:34 - let me check the live chat really
07:37 - quickly just say hi to everyone while
07:43 - they did a few people here really early
07:45 - kind of seen if anybody's here everyone
07:51 - someone here from India awesome welcome
07:55 - someone from Chile really happy to have
07:59 - you all watching okay
08:08 - Helio says there's some info regarding
08:14 - debounce for the search that's offered
08:19 - in in lodash so off to check that out
08:22 - thank you for that I'll check that out
08:24 - after the after the stream okay
08:32 - Sebastian asked about the date for the
08:34 - post yeah that'll be something that'll
08:36 - need to be added will definitely need
08:39 - with all the normal things that you
08:41 - would expect from you know from a blog
08:44 - will want to put in there with the
08:47 - exception of probably we won't need
08:49 - author because they're you know these
08:52 - are just going to be quick like news
08:53 - announcements and things so they're not
08:56 - gonna be exactly like a normal blog post
08:58 - at least for right now so I think we can
09:01 - leave out the author but other than that
09:03 - will want to have the date Nima des what
09:10 - you - see of course you're doing I'm
09:11 - doing the react course the one that just
09:13 - came out so if anybody else is doing the
09:16 - react course from Udacity then let me
09:19 - know and so far I'm I'm almost done with
09:23 - the first project it's it's the book
09:24 - like a book app if anyone is interested
09:27 - it's on my my github page it it should
09:31 - be you know kind of right at the top I
09:35 - can't remember what I called it but if
09:38 - you want to check out what I'm doing for
09:40 - that cool
09:40 - it is there it's almost finished I
09:43 - haven't done anything with the UI though
09:45 - but in terms of functionality pretty
09:48 - much done I just need to link up react
09:51 - router so that everything has like the
09:56 - forward and back functionality works
10:10 - Oh someone from Norway Hey
10:23 - all right cool so hey everyone I'm gonna
10:28 - get started now I'll try to keep an eye
10:30 - on the chat while I'm going but if you
10:33 - watch before you know how it is
10:34 - sometimes you get into the code maybe a
10:36 - few minutes before I get to check again
10:38 - but at the end I will do I'll answer
10:42 - some questions I need to make sure I end
10:45 - just a heads up I need to end this
10:49 - before 4:00 because my son has my oldest
10:56 - son has karate lessons at 5:00 so I'll
11:01 - probably have to leave around 4 o'clock
11:03 - so maybe 3:30 I'll start wrapping things
11:06 - up eastern time this is all Eastern time
11:09 - so probably do like an hour and a half
11:12 - of coding and then maybe a half hour of
11:14 - question-and-answer so I mean that's
11:17 - that's a decently long stream we'll try
11:19 - to get as much done as we can so I'm
11:23 - starting to feel the pressure a bit we
11:25 - only have till the 20th of this month to
11:28 - get pretty much everything done that's
11:31 - in the Trello board for this project
11:32 - that I have linked up in the description
11:35 - so like everything in these first three
11:39 - columns needs to be done and then
11:43 - potentially anything from this column
11:45 - that I need also needs to be done so
11:47 - it's a lot of stuff so I may be I was
11:52 - hoping I wouldn't have to work extra
11:54 - this week but I might have to
12:01 - it's possible there might be some extra
12:03 - long streams coming they do this week
12:10 - okay if you have if you have someone
12:12 - from Germany someone from South Korea
12:15 - awesome Zanna says ouch that's a lot
12:22 - chance when do you have the time I'm
12:26 - just gonna have to work a lot that's
12:31 - right so I mean my normal work day is
12:33 - like seven hours of work and I'll just
12:36 - have to work a lot more than that and
12:38 - and get it done
12:40 - it's possible some of the things on that
12:42 - list could just wait and you know maybe
12:46 - they're not absolutely necessary so off
12:49 - I'll go through the list later in the
12:51 - week and really make sure that
12:52 - everything on there is absolutely
12:54 - necessary but otherwise to just I have
12:59 - to get it I have to get it done and they
13:03 - I'm gonna move on to another project
13:04 - after that so in like two weeks we'll be
13:07 - we'll be working on something different
13:09 - in you know for the streams so let me
13:13 - get out of these are the resources oh no
13:17 - this isn't it so I did switch over I
13:20 - prepared a little bit today for the
13:22 - stream I got got this up so as you can
13:26 - see like like I said this is all
13:28 - hard-coded so we're gonna have to pull
13:32 - this in and populate these lists from
13:36 - from the API this mate instead of being
13:40 - a list this may end up being a drop-down
13:42 - because if there's a lot of categories I
13:44 - don't want a giant list of categories
13:47 - the tags I might end up making this like
13:51 - you know like you know you see like the
13:53 - tag cloud where the tags that are used
13:59 - most often or bigger I think that would
14:03 - be kind of cool
14:04 - so maybe y'all when you get the data
14:08 - from the API it tells you how many times
14:11 - the tag has been used so if we link that
14:14 - piece of data up to the font size then
14:18 - we should be able to make it so each tag
14:22 - the tag font size for each tag is based
14:26 - on the number of times that tag is used
14:28 - will obviously have you know lower limit
14:30 - at an upper limit so the font stays
14:32 - readable at the lower end and it's not
14:35 - too big on the higher end but I think
14:36 - that would be a cool feature not
14:39 - necessary though that might be one of
14:41 - the things that only happens if we have
14:42 - time and probably won't get to this
14:47 - today in terms of you know the dates
14:50 - also that you know the dates are not
14:53 - going to be necessary at first anyway
14:56 - there's just not gonna be enough enough
14:59 - posts to really warrant really any of
15:02 - these these things are necessary at
15:04 - first because there's only gonna be a
15:06 - few posts but what will work if we can
15:10 - so first things first let's get some of
15:13 - those normal blog things in the display
15:17 - and we'll probably want to take this out
15:20 - and make it its own component we're
15:24 - gonna add stuff it's gonna start to get
15:26 - bigger better just to move it out of
15:27 - here
15:28 - so why don't we do that first so I'm
15:32 - gonna go in case you're not that
15:35 - familiar with the command line I'm gonna
15:37 - switch over to the command line and
15:46 - I'm gonna go type in touch and then
15:52 - components all right so if you're on the
15:55 - command line and you want to create a
15:56 - new file you use the command touch this
16:01 - is on a Mac and I haven't used a command
16:04 - line on a PC and so long I can't
16:06 - remember which commands are the same or
16:08 - not so possible that the commands I'm
16:10 - using here won't work but but just in
16:13 - case that you're kind of new with the
16:15 - command line this is how you create a
16:16 - file and I'm gonna make it in the
16:18 - components folder so right now I'm in
16:20 - the the just the base folder for this
16:22 - project I need to go into the components
16:24 - folder and inside that folder I want to
16:26 - make a new component called blog j/s so
16:33 - now if I go back over to the project you
16:37 - see see if I can zoom I never figured
16:45 - out there we go
16:49 - all right I'll zoom in here so you can
16:52 - see stuff in in my editor at least stuff
16:56 - in green is are things that have been
16:58 - added that are new so now we've just
16:59 - added this blog j/s file all right so it
17:04 - might seem like why would I want to type
17:06 - that out when I could have just gone
17:08 - here and said you know give me a new new
17:11 - file and I could have just done it there
17:13 - after a while and you start using the
17:16 - command line it actually ends up being
17:19 - faster to just do more through the
17:21 - command line so if you're new to it
17:24 - probably nothing is faster than the
17:26 - command line right now but if you get
17:28 - used to it it's way faster than any
17:30 - graphical interface for a lot of things
17:32 - I even do image editing through the
17:34 - command line now and I prefer that to
17:36 - any type of graphical editing so anyway
17:40 - enough enough of that but I like to go
17:42 - into some of those little details
17:43 - occasionally because if people of all
17:45 - skill levels watching so don't want to
17:49 - leave people behind with something that
17:51 - it's simple to me now because I've been
17:54 - using it for so long but I remember when
17:55 - I first started like anything on the
17:57 - command
17:58 - it's just like a mystery to me and
18:01 - everybody on YouTube that was just
18:03 - flying through commands like it just
18:05 - seems so awesome so we're gonna make
18:09 - this a component and I'd like to make
18:11 - this a stateless functional component so
18:13 - I haven't done this yet on any of the
18:16 - any of the streams but basically it's
18:23 - it's a kind of a slightly shorter way to
18:26 - make a component then what we have been
18:29 - using and you can't use it all the time
18:32 - but if you have a component like this
18:35 - where it's basically not doing much at
18:38 - all i mean it it's just gonna take some
18:40 - props and display it and that's about it
18:43 - nothing else is really gonna be
18:44 - happening oops I thought I had the news
18:48 - thing up oh well so but first thing
18:50 - we're gonna do is import react from let
18:56 - me double check it from react okay
19:00 - that's what I thought it was these stuff
19:03 - in the top I never type out I'm always
19:05 - just copy and pasting it so I have to
19:08 - double check what I'm using it so now
19:10 - we're gonna say Const and we're gonna
19:13 - call this blog equals and let me I'm
19:24 - actually gonna double check I'm gonna
19:26 - bring up on my other screen my project
19:29 - do I have it here there we go this is
19:39 - from my project for the Udacity course
19:41 - I'm gonna put on the other screen so
19:42 - this is where I learned this stuff from
19:44 - the course so it's I'm trying to use
19:46 - what I'm learning immediately so don't
19:48 - forget it so I'm gonna bring it up on
19:49 - the screen so I get all the syntax right
19:51 - because I don't want to waste your time
19:52 - with me messing up the syntax trying to
19:57 - seem like I know this stuff by heart
20:00 - when I really don't alright so basically
20:06 - this is it we just have to export
20:16 - and that's it that's all we need so let
20:20 - me compare this to another kind of
20:24 - similar component so let's check out
20:26 - like this resource card so basically
20:29 - doing the same thing there they're just
20:30 - taking in some props and displaying it
20:33 - now of course the resource cards has a
20:36 - bit more here but look at what we have
20:39 - so the import is slightly different
20:42 - because we're important component but up
20:43 - here you know we believe make a class
20:45 - right and then we have this render
20:48 - function and then we have to say with
20:50 - the return within there okay and then we
20:53 - export so basically we're getting rid of
20:55 - the render and the return this is
20:59 - slightly shorter this line is get rid of
21:02 - a few brackets and then we end up having
21:05 - something that's a lot a lot cleaner
21:09 - looking so not really like a really huge
21:13 - difference but it looks a bit nicer also
21:18 - you all show you in a second the way we
21:21 - call on these props is slightly
21:23 - different than what we do so we'll say
21:26 - like this props you don't need this
21:29 - anymore within here you can just say
21:31 - props so that's the only that's really
21:34 - the only big difference in terms of what
21:37 - you're going to do within within here
21:40 - all right so let's bring this I lost my
21:45 - news page here it is so let's bring the
21:49 - news here we go
21:57 - that's actually weird this is I
21:58 - highlighted this div and it's giving me
22:01 - it's I think I messed that up and never
22:07 - knew about it so I did i made this weeks
22:10 - ago but it seems like I need to have
22:13 - another another div inside of here right
22:21 - oh I know what happened
22:24 - okay this still works actually I
22:27 - remember thinking the same thing now
22:29 - weeks ago so I'm just closing this div
22:32 - since it's I'm just gonna make a div
22:36 - here and then that way it won't keep
22:38 - tricking my editor and in a week I won't
22:42 - forget again and have it confuse me okay
22:46 - so let's just copy this and I can get
22:51 - rid of get rid of it because we're gonna
22:57 - pull it in as a component and we need to
23:08 - slug title when you make sure we pull in
23:12 - the same props that it needs so we need
23:14 - to get the slug we need to pull in a
23:16 - title we need the content also we're
23:19 - gonna need to pull in the date and
23:24 - obviously I don't remember what the date
23:26 - format is and so we'll probably have to
23:29 - do something with the format of the date
23:31 - to make it more presentable but for now
23:36 - it was a day we need the slug title and
23:40 - content alright so here we're going to
23:45 - bring in his component blog and then
23:49 - we're gonna pass in the props that we
23:52 - had before to let me since we're gonna
23:55 - be working on both of these
23:57 - let's move this blog component over here
24:00 - so we can see them side by side let me
24:03 - know if this font is too small
24:05 - I'll make sure I'll check back in like
24:08 - 30 seconds in the live chat
24:10 - if it's too small for you I can
24:13 - definitely I can make it bigger it's
24:14 - it's comfortable right now for me but if
24:18 - it's too small for you I can definitely
24:20 - make it bigger so let's bring in slug
24:34 - slug and we need a title title rendered
24:44 - oops I got the equal sign and if you're
24:51 - not familiar with react and a lot of
24:52 - this is over your head I apologize in
24:54 - previous videos I have taken a little
24:57 - bit more time to explain this so if you
25:01 - if you want to watch me explain it you
25:03 - can kind of check out some of the titles
25:04 - of the videos and titles that would talk
25:06 - about specifically about react
25:08 - components will probably have the best
25:10 - explanation but I don't really think
25:12 - that my videos are the best to get kind
25:14 - of a tutorial so you might want to you
25:17 - know check out the docs and for react or
25:20 - check out some other videos or courses
25:23 - on react to get a better idea of what's
25:28 - kind of going on here I'll do my best to
25:29 - explain it so right now we are passing
25:33 - in what are called props so that this
25:37 - component here can use all the data that
25:40 - we're pulling in in this component this
25:43 - we're going to pass on that data through
25:46 - props it's the last one we need is
25:53 - content right yeah
26:11 - we always want to make sure we close it
26:13 - so all the HTML like tags in react when
26:19 - you're using JSX
26:20 - have to be closed you'll get an error
26:25 - otherwise so make sure you you're
26:27 - closing everything and that looks good
26:31 - we we do need to make sure that we're
26:33 - importing this because right now this
26:35 - component will have no idea what we're
26:37 - talking about because we haven't
26:39 - imported it so let's go up here and
26:41 - we're gonna import actually I'm just
26:46 - gonna copy this paste it and change this
26:51 - to the log oops so now it's importing
26:58 - the component blog from the folder
27:01 - components blog you don't have to put
27:05 - the dot je s at the end it knows that
27:08 - all these are going to be JavaScript
27:09 - files so now what should happen is when
27:15 - I save this I'll actually want em so we
27:19 - didn't change anything over here but
27:21 - when I change this to reflect these
27:24 - names of these props it should
27:26 - everything should look exactly the same
27:28 - as it did before so I just need to to
27:31 - change this and instead of post it's
27:39 - gonna be props so props slug and
27:52 - and then also we don't need rendered
27:57 - right since we're bringing in
28:01 - we're already bringing in the rendered
28:04 - version of this content and this this is
28:08 - not like some special command this is
28:10 - just the way the JSON file is formatted
28:12 - that comes from WordPress okay so now
28:17 - I'll save this file and I'll save this
28:19 - file and let's check out and see what
28:22 - the site looks like yay it still looks
28:25 - the same
28:26 - so I'll refresh just to be sure usually
28:30 - we get a you know an instant refresh
28:35 - actually good thing I refreshed it looks
28:38 - like my dev server is up here just click
28:44 - my dev server has quit working once
28:47 - again
29:04 - hmm I is not defined uh-oh looks like I
29:08 - forgot something
29:09 - oh the key okay so I was bringing in a
29:15 - key and it was just an iterator so I
29:23 - need to pass that in I forgot about that
29:27 - so let's pass in the key and this will
29:30 - be I and then here it should work we'll
29:38 - just need to put it in drops dot I so in
29:44 - react if you're going to be you know
29:47 - iterating over components and rendering
29:50 - the same component over and over again
29:51 - each one has to have a unique key it
29:55 - doesn't have to be unique to your whole
29:56 - react application but has to be unique
29:58 - among those sibling components so in
30:02 - this case you know it's just the the
30:06 - iterator so it's just gonna be like 0 1
30:07 - 2 3 4 all right but we could each each
30:11 - of these posts will have their own ID
30:13 - that's been given to it from WordPress
30:16 - so we could use that if we needed to but
30:18 - we don't really need to need that so
30:22 - since we wouldn't I would normally pull
30:24 - in the wordpress ID of something if i
30:26 - was only gonna use it for the key but if
30:29 - i needed it for something else then i
30:31 - probably just use it for the key - all
30:36 - right so now it works so now we can see
30:38 - we have this and just to kind of show
30:43 - you in dev tools react so if you are
30:50 - doing anything with react I highly
30:52 - recommend getting the react extension
30:56 - for dev tools I have no idea how I
30:59 - initially got this it's been too long so
31:01 - I can't remember but I'm sure I know it
31:05 - wasn't difficult to load up on here so
31:09 - let's see news first here we go so we
31:15 - have blog just to show you the name
31:18 - of the component now as it is using the
31:21 - blog component and you can see we have
31:24 - these props are being passed so this is
31:26 - the content being passed we have this
31:28 - love the title so it's working exactly
31:34 - how we wanted to I'm gonna check the
31:41 - live chat since it's been quite a while
31:44 - since I checked it Wow everyone in the
31:50 - live chat has been busy this is this
31:53 - huge since there's so much activity the
31:56 - live chat I'll say it right now if you
31:58 - ask a question early on and I don't get
32:00 - to it there's a chance that I might not
32:03 - ever see it because when the chat gets
32:06 - really big the stuff that the comments
32:09 - that came earliest I can't read them
32:11 - anymore they're just gone
32:13 - so if I do miss your question and you
32:16 - stick around for the Q&A at the end you
32:18 - can just ask it again or you can put it
32:21 - in the comments to this video or you can
32:24 - message me on Twitter and I'll answer it
32:27 - I'll answer it then okay so I scrolled
32:32 - back up to the last place I looked
32:34 - oh yes people from Austria Romania
32:45 - Albania awesome
32:52 - Venezuela that's awesome I love hearing
32:56 - where where you all are from I think
32:58 - it's a really fun that it's really fun
33:01 - that so many people from all over the
33:03 - world in different time zones are all
33:04 - coming together and you know there's
33:09 - just so much nice interaction the live
33:11 - chat you all helped me out a lot it's
33:13 - just really cool
33:22 - oh there is some talk in the live chat
33:24 - about the the link to my Udacity project
33:29 - yeah and I didn't even think about it
33:31 - but yeah so this project this react CI
33:34 - is underneath FUS marcom so it's
33:40 - Franciscan University of student ville
33:42 - marketing department my page let me go
33:47 - to my profile what's mine mine is Jessie
33:54 - our Weigel so what I'm talking about is
34:01 - this one this my read starter project so
34:11 - sorry about that I totally forgot that I
34:13 - had had the other project under a
34:16 - different no what do they call one I
34:19 - can't remember organization is how they
34:22 - call it an organization account anyway
34:25 - yes I haven't even changed the readme or
34:28 - anything yet I just I just was like
34:31 - trying to focus and work through and get
34:33 - all the functionality down before I mess
34:35 - with anything else because it's so easy
34:37 - to get caught up in the the UI and you
34:41 - know trying to make the reaming
34:42 - everything that I thought this is gonna
34:44 - take me forever I just want to make sure
34:46 - I get it done alright okay cool and
34:53 - Sebastian had already put in the live
34:55 - chat the the link that I just showed you
34:58 - so I should have just scrolled down a
35:00 - bit as Anna said could you sometimes
35:06 - just film your editor while you code
35:08 - without being distracted by talking to
35:10 - us I would look at that I mean if you
35:13 - don't have the time for talking okay
35:17 - I never thought about doing that I
35:19 - always figured that would be boring but
35:22 - yeah I love to think about that so yeah
35:26 - let me know what you all think the
35:27 - suggestion was I made I don't have time
35:33 - and it's true like I don't have I
35:35 - couldn't
35:35 - do this all day because it does take
35:39 - extra time to do the talking and things
35:41 - I think it's it's really valuable for me
35:44 - because I get so many great ideas but it
35:47 - does it slows things down a bit so
35:49 - there's a lot of things that need done
35:52 - that I know how to do it it just it
35:53 - needs to get done and they're not really
35:55 - you know fun to watch I would I would
35:58 - say so I don't record them but maybe if
36:02 - you all would be interested in seeing
36:04 - some recordings which are basically me
36:06 - just working not talking I might be
36:11 - interested in that I don't know that I
36:14 - would take up the free code camp channel
36:16 - with all that all day in case you know
36:19 - occasionally there are some I know
36:20 - Quincy does some live interview
36:22 - sometimes so I wouldn't want to be a you
36:24 - know on all the time so I'd either do it
36:26 - either like on my channel my youtube
36:29 - channel or maybe I'd get like a twitch
36:31 - channel or something to do that sort of
36:34 - thing but I'm I'm open for that if you
36:38 - alright I get I would kind of feel bad
36:40 - not talking to anybody but I guess if
36:43 - you're interested I would I'd be fine
36:45 - with that
36:50 - vim Rossi asks is there any difference
36:53 - in commands for Ubuntu or Mac I don't
36:59 - really I've never come across any
37:01 - difference not not to say that there
37:03 - aren't any differences maybe there are I
37:05 - but I have personally never seen any
37:07 - difference between Mac and Linux
37:10 - commands
37:17 - okay wrote Rohan is getting deep on me
37:20 - here and say saying you are using a PC
37:23 - you aren't using Windows says even
37:26 - modern Mac's our pcs technically
37:29 - technically all Macs are IBM
37:32 - pc-compatible so yes so good distinction
37:36 - roll on so on Windows the commands are
37:40 - different yeah let's not vim Brasi says
37:50 - don't start Mac versus windows here yeah
37:52 - I didn't mean to start I mean I don't
37:53 - care if in the live chat you have
37:55 - discussions about you know whatever as
37:57 - long as it's you know not not being mean
38:00 - to anybody I guess but yeah I don't mean
38:03 - to argue I own several PCs and a Mac and
38:10 - I have a Chromebook and I run I don't
38:14 - have a Linux you know computer that I
38:16 - use but I use Linux on my servers so so
38:21 - I can see the benefits and all of them
38:23 - they all have good things about them
38:28 - although anymore the only thing that I
38:30 - use Windows for really is for gaming and
38:34 - I don't really have that much time for
38:36 - gaming now at all I'd probably been
38:38 - months since I've played a computer game
38:40 - you know on a Windows computer
38:55 - okay Andrew R asks about the Udacity
39:00 - course link yeah I guess I can post it
39:07 - do you mean specify first do you mean
39:12 - the link to like sign up and register
39:15 - for the course or are you talking about
39:17 - the link to my project for the course if
39:22 - it's the link to my project it already
39:24 - has been put in the chat by Sebastian a
39:27 - little bit higher up in the chat if it's
39:29 - the link to the Udacity course I could
39:31 - give you a link but I think they're
39:33 - really pushing the course a lot right
39:35 - now so I think the homepage for Udacity
39:37 - would you just be Udacity calm I'm
39:38 - pretty sure that they have it on the
39:40 - homepage at least they did at one point
39:51 - I know there's discussion there's always
39:53 - a discussion about the editor always us
39:57 - I wonder how long you can keep it going
40:01 - that like there's gonna be discussing
40:04 - about the editor and every single every
40:07 - single time I stream which is cool I'm
40:10 - not gonna get into the discussion I just
40:12 - noted somebody did ask about whether it
40:15 - was still slow i I think the Adam editor
40:19 - to me at least to seem like it has
40:21 - gotten faster than it was it's still not
40:24 - as fast like Visual Studio code seems
40:26 - faster to me it's possible that's just
40:29 - because I have a lot more plugin it's
40:31 - going for Adam but in general vs code
40:34 - seems faster but Adam seems way faster
40:37 - than it did when I first got it which
40:40 - was a few years ago I think I started
40:43 - using Adam like when it when it first
40:45 - came out really close to it so it was
40:51 - quite slow at one time
41:01 - adhi I'm not sure how to pronounce it's
41:04 - a Adi says am I the only new beer you're
41:06 - not the only new beer I - I'm a new
41:12 - Santa says we're all react noobs that's
41:16 - why we're here some are more advanced
41:17 - yeah ok I'll I'll make sure I'd try to
41:25 - do a better job of explaining things for
41:28 - those who are not familiar with react
41:30 - and it looks like there's some good
41:32 - explanation going on in a live chat as
41:34 - well so thank you all for for taking the
41:37 - time to explain that to the people who
41:39 - aren't familiar with it oh cool Zanna it
41:45 - said she finished the code academy code
41:48 - academy react course react 1 awesome I
41:52 - went through those when they first came
41:54 - out I don't know if they have more I
41:56 - want to check again to see if they've
41:58 - added on to the course or anything if
42:00 - there's more to do but I remember it
42:01 - being pretty helpful unfortunately after
42:04 - I took that course I didn't have a
42:06 - project that I was doing in react so I
42:08 - forgot most of what I had learned in
42:10 - that course but I think it all kind of
42:13 - sticks around in long-term memory so
42:15 - it's the next time I tried to learn it I
42:17 - get caught on quicker ok
42:26 - almost almost through with the with the
42:29 - live chat I got to try to look back more
42:32 - frequently so I don't have these giant
42:33 - periods where I'm taking a break from
42:36 - coding I think it just might be better
42:39 - for those of you watching it's possible
42:44 - there are some people that don't really
42:45 - care about the latch and just want to
42:46 - see the code
43:07 - Mohammed Khan ass is it worth doing the
43:10 - Codecademy course for me I think it was
43:14 - worth it it's somewhat depends on how
43:17 - advanced you are with react and how you
43:20 - like to learn best I found it to be I
43:24 - find most of the codecademy things to be
43:26 - like a lot of like really I can holding
43:28 - step by step and I often don't know
43:30 - enough at the end to really do a project
43:32 - on my own but it helps me to get that
43:34 - little bit of confidence and knowledge
43:36 - of things without having to commit to
43:38 - like setting up my own development
43:40 - environment for it and everything so I
43:42 - think it's worthwhile it might slightly
43:47 - be a waste of time if you're you know
43:49 - more than just the beginner at react you
43:52 - may pick up a few things but it might
43:55 - not really be worth it if you already
43:58 - know a bit so but I I thought when I did
44:02 - it that it was worthwhile but I was
44:04 - really really new at react to the point
44:06 - where like I I knew you know almost
44:09 - nothing I had just seen some people use
44:11 - it at a conference and knew enough to
44:14 - knew that I wanted to know more but that
44:16 - was it
44:31 - okay all right looks like Jax's doesn't
44:35 - mind listening to the the to the chat me
44:38 - revisiting the chat so okay cool
44:46 - alright she also have some people
44:48 - talking about the best training courses
44:51 - for react so someone mentioned free
44:55 - cocaine yeah free code camp is good to
44:57 - learn your basic JavaScript I haven't
45:00 - checked out the new free code camp so
45:02 - there's a beta version of free code camp
45:04 - that I think does go and more it does a
45:09 - lot more with react I haven't looked at
45:12 - the beta version for a really long time
45:16 - like months and months so I don't know I
45:19 - can't speak personally about what it's
45:20 - what it's like but I'm pretty sure it
45:23 - has some stuff for reacting you can
45:24 - check out the beta stuff now so if you
45:28 - like free code camp you can check out
45:30 - the react stuff from free code camp
45:39 - alright so let me go back now I've
45:42 - gotten through a lot of the live chat I
45:43 - skipped over some stuff I'll come back
45:45 - later on and really look through it but
45:48 - I think I got the important questions
45:50 - when I go back to the live chat really
45:52 - what I want to do is make sure anybody
45:54 - especially who's new that I make sure I
45:57 - address the questions because I know you
46:00 - know those of you who watch for a long
46:01 - time I'm sure you're okay if I miss
46:04 - something at some point and but I don't
46:07 - want new people to feel ignored
46:08 - especially if they're know not only new
46:11 - to this channel but you know they're
46:13 - also new to coding so I want to make
46:16 - sure that everybody's everybody is
46:19 - addressed you know at least at some
46:21 - point especially if I see something like
46:23 - a new person that I haven't haven't seen
46:26 - before in the live chat so hey or
46:29 - somebody joining in IT engineer join in
46:32 - so hey thanks for watching
46:40 - breakpoint recommends the official react
46:42 - tutorial so yeah check that out I can't
46:46 - believe I forgot to mention that yeah
46:47 - the react like the react.js website has
46:51 - a tutorial to go through so that would
46:55 - also be cool dealing for that is you you
46:59 - do set up your development environment
47:01 - on your own computer from there so if
47:03 - you're not comfortable with that part of
47:05 - it then maybe you'd want to do something
47:07 - that's more in browser like Codecademy
47:10 - free code camp stuff browser-based first
47:12 - to get you comfortable but if you're
47:15 - already comfortable setting up a dev
47:16 - environment then yeah the react course
47:19 - the react to toriel is is great ok one
47:30 - more from the live set before we get
47:31 - started so vim Rossi says I'm 30 years
47:33 - old
47:34 - Nubian web development D recruiters have
47:37 - age bias when hiring I don't know that I
47:42 - actually I'm not sure that I can answer
47:44 - that
47:45 - you know accurately from what I have
47:49 - heard there's a lot of people in the
47:51 - free code camp forum and also on medium
47:54 - the do blog posts and talk about their
47:55 - experience getting hired and almost
47:58 - everybody that I read about getting
48:01 - hired is older than 30
48:04 - it's just especially lately it seems
48:07 - like everyone that's writing about being
48:09 - able to get a job is older than 30 so it
48:12 - seems like maybe there's maybe there's
48:15 - not they're getting a job but that's
48:16 - entirely you know anecdotal I don't have
48:18 - any data to back up anything like that
48:21 - but it looks like I'm 31 right now I got
48:25 - hired something I was like 28 or 29 when
48:29 - I got hired so not you know right around
48:33 - 30 so at least for me I was able to get
48:37 - hired and I hope that there's not a lot
48:42 - of age bias because if I want to if I
48:45 - ever want to switch and get a job
48:47 - somewhere else I'm definitely gonna be
48:48 - older then
48:50 - am now so I'll probably you know be
48:52 - older than 30 for sure so anyway I don't
48:56 - really know maybe if someone else has
48:58 - some some better insight into the world
49:03 - of recruiters you could you know kind of
49:06 - contribute there in the live chat all
49:15 - right so let's let's go back actually
49:20 - just reminded me my my dad told me
49:23 - yesterday that he's gonna retire in
49:25 - September the end of September
49:27 - I think he's 57 now and I told him I was
49:33 - asking him what he's gonna do any
49:34 - retires and I said you wanna learn how
49:35 - to be a developer I said I could teach
49:38 - you how to do stuff and so he said his
49:41 - you know he's 57 and he's gonna I don't
49:44 - think he's gonna really learn how to be
49:46 - a developer but I'll try I'll try to see
49:48 - if you know even if he doesn't want to
49:52 - get a job as a developer he'd be cool to
49:53 - be able to talk about the stuff with my
49:55 - dad but I really think he could I told
49:59 - him he'd get a lot of publicity if he
50:01 - published his journey to becoming a
50:02 - developer after a retiring I think that
50:06 - would be a cool story I told him I tell
50:09 - everybody on Twitter about it if he did
50:10 - do it but all right
50:15 - okay I had a reminder for a meeting so
50:17 - normally on Mondays I have this meeting
50:18 - at 3:00 p.m. but today my department
50:23 - head came in and asked for the data that
50:25 - I was supposed to give in the meeting
50:27 - and I had already put it into a
50:30 - spreadsheet and it was already raised
50:32 - she said okay you don't have to come to
50:34 - the meeting which is awesome because I
50:36 - need all the time I can get for this
50:37 - project and that means I get to do a
50:39 - longer stream which which is really
50:42 - great I was actually kind of in a kind
50:46 - of a down mood all day until I started
50:48 - the stream so thank you everyone for
50:52 - helping improve my my mood just had some
50:58 - some bad stuff happen in my in my family
51:01 - this weekend so I was just kind of
51:03 - about that but let's get back to this
51:07 - let's go let's put in a date so let's
51:10 - see what format we're gonna get when we
51:12 - try to pull this date in and we'll try
51:15 - to reformat it in a way that's a little
51:18 - bit easier to read if we need to if I
51:27 - want to switch this order right now cuz
51:30 - it'll keep bothering me so I'd like to
51:32 - keep the code in the middle so I can
51:34 - just quickly kind of move move the
51:36 - screens
51:46 - okay so we're gonna be working first we
51:49 - need to pull in the dates
51:52 - okay so right now we are just getting
51:55 - posts and I'm pulling in all everything
51:57 - so we should be able to bring in the
51:58 - date I'm gonna check the kind of the raw
52:03 - API data and so we can check out what we
52:10 - have to work with and I'll bring it over
52:13 - here on this screen so y'all can see it
52:16 - as well all right so this is all the
52:18 - data that we have to work with right now
52:19 - when we get we pull in posts so it looks
52:24 - like we have so we have a date and this
52:27 - is the date format so we definitely need
52:30 - to change this format
52:39 - quickly I'm just gonna kind of look
52:41 - through and see if there's any other
52:42 - data that we probably should be putting
52:44 - in there
52:51 - Oh actually I'm wondering if I should
52:57 - pull in any any images into this view I
53:03 - don't think I'm going to right now just
53:06 - because I have such a short amount of
53:09 - time to get this all done I I think I
53:13 - kind of like well I mean the way it
53:16 - looks right now listen great but I can
53:17 - see what it will end up looking like
53:20 - kind of in my mind and I think I like it
53:22 - without the images we'll see if I need
53:27 - to put in the images later on I will
53:30 - when for certainly when people click to
53:34 - go and you know when a user clicks and
53:36 - goes into the main you know single post
53:38 - page and images can be there but on this
53:41 - page I think it might be nice to not
53:44 - have them oh we are gonna need the
53:50 - categories yeah we need to bring in
53:55 - categories because we want to set up
54:01 - some filters before when people click on
54:05 - these different categories so normally
54:11 - in a blog setup like if this were just a
54:14 - wordpress blog you'd click on a category
54:17 - and there'd actually be an entire page
54:19 - for those categories I don't think
54:23 - that's necessary for this that does give
54:26 - the advantage of having an actual link
54:29 - someone could go to but it's it's really
54:33 - rare that you could share a link to a
54:36 - category page on a blog so I think I
54:40 - mean you can let me know I just I never
54:43 - bookmark or share links to category
54:46 - pages on blogs so maybe maybe people do
54:49 - and I'm just not aware of it I just
54:54 - glanced back at the latest comment from
55:01 - Elaine I'm sorry I really didn't feel
55:04 - bad if I mess up your name
55:06 - it's al AI n says I have no idea that
55:10 - you can react in WordPress so yes I mean
55:15 - technically it's not a wordpress site
55:17 - I'm just pulling in data from a
55:19 - wordpress site that's on a different
55:21 - server but you could actually use react
55:27 - like within a wordpress theme I've never
55:31 - done it I've seen I've seen some stuff
55:35 - on github of people doing it and I'm
55:39 - pretty sure they've done it successfully
55:42 - but I've never tried to do it I always
55:44 - just thought you know if I'm gonna use
55:48 - react I'm gonna do you know an entirely
55:51 - separate react site but maybe there are
55:54 - some advantages to doing it you know
55:56 - more like the traditional WordPress
55:58 - theme route I'm just not really aware of
56:01 - them okay we need to make sure we we
56:09 - pull an announcement I don't think we're
56:13 - going to need to mess with us right now
56:14 - so basically the there are two types
56:19 - they're going to be news and there's
56:20 - gonna be announcements I'm not entirely
56:22 - sure what the difference is between news
56:24 - and announcements it doesn't really
56:25 - matter for what I'm doing though because
56:27 - I'm not gonna be entering in content but
56:30 - it's possible that we could do we would
56:32 - want to put tabs for news and
56:34 - announcement but I don't think so I
56:36 - think it'd be fine to just put things
56:39 - you know right just right in order on
56:43 - the home page they will be separated
56:45 - from news and announcements so I'm not
56:49 - I'm not too worried about it and I'm not
56:50 - sure that a user coming to the site
56:53 - would know all right well what's the
56:56 - news with falls under news what falls
56:58 - under announcements I don't know that it
56:59 - would actually be useful to anyone to be
57:03 - able to filter by news and announcements
57:04 - these categories are gonna be better and
57:07 - then we will probably put in a search
57:09 - function somewhere and that will be more
57:14 - okay sorry I'm just doing a lot of
57:17 - thinking out loud here and not a lot of
57:19 - coding but I guess it's better to do
57:23 - this first than to have to code
57:26 - everything over and over again because
57:30 - of changing my mind halfway through okay
57:33 - so I think we're we're good let's pull
57:36 - in the date we'll just stick is one step
57:40 - at a time I feel like I just planned out
57:41 - everything for this page all at once and
57:46 - we haven't gotten much done so let's
57:49 - pull in the date first and then let's
57:51 - convert this date this was actually be
57:53 - cool to do because dates always drive me
57:56 - crazy
57:57 - I've successfully worked with them and
58:00 - displayed them before but I always
58:02 - forget how I did it so I'll have to look
58:04 - up some previous projects because I'm
58:07 - pretty sure on a previous site I took a
58:08 - date in that exact same format from
58:10 - WordPress and then displayed it in a
58:14 - more user friendly way I think I did off
58:18 - the double check all right so let's pull
58:24 - in first we're gonna pass in the date
58:27 - like if you remember we're getting the
58:29 - data from WordPress the WordPress API
58:31 - here and the news component and this
58:34 - news component is our entire news page
58:37 - and then we're grabbing the data here
58:39 - and then we're passing that data to our
58:42 - blog component and we're passing it as a
58:50 - prop or as you know multiple props so
58:54 - let's go date and we're gonna say post
58:59 - date so now we're gonna pass that in
59:04 - will now have access to date here within
59:07 - our blog component so we're gonna put
59:14 - the date let me look quickly maybe the
59:16 - date could go right underneath the title
59:20 - we'll see how that looks really I mean
59:23 - it's gonna go either above the time
59:26 - below the title probably the best places
59:28 - to put it
59:29 - so we'll try below first here's our
59:34 - title it's an h2 and it is it's wrapped
59:38 - in a link tag let's make this we just
59:43 - put into this a span and we're
59:49 - definitely gonna style it so that it's
59:52 - it shows up but for now we'll just put
59:54 - it in here as from date
60:07 - okay so this is just the test to make
60:10 - sure we've imported it properly it's
60:12 - obviously gonna look there you go like
60:14 - this alright so first things first let's
60:17 - get this reformat it we are also going
60:19 - to want to move it up a bit I don't mind
60:22 - the size it's kind of small but I'm fine
60:24 - with that because I don't really want
60:25 - the date to be the focus so I'd like it
60:29 - to be smaller than the title and the
60:32 - excerpt but I would like to move it up
60:35 - so that it sits right under here so
60:37 - we'll probably a lot of this this
60:41 - padding is more this is probably because
60:43 - of the H text we'll probably need to set
60:45 - some styles on this H tag to bring this
60:48 - up but first let's get this date going
60:51 - so first thing I'm going to do is check
60:55 - out a project where I use this
60:58 - previously actually I can go here it's
61:02 - already open I did a project this is a
61:06 - private repository right now so
61:08 - unfortunately you won't be able to check
61:09 - it out it's got to be private because
61:16 - the entire website is private well I
61:24 - thought it was I thought I had worked on
61:27 - it
61:27 - there is so actually this is an
61:32 - interesting phrase I could show this
61:34 - project more maybe with I redo it one
61:38 - day I'll convert it to react but this is
61:41 - the same concept I'm pulling data from
61:43 - the WordPress API but instead of doing
61:46 - it with react
61:47 - I made the entire UI and all the
61:49 - interactions and everything with jQuery
61:52 - so I really wish I could show you just
61:56 - like how insane the code is even the
61:59 - routing so like the URLs all work each
62:04 - post has its own URL every time you do a
62:08 - search it has its own URL every category
62:12 - everything so it's insane and the readme
62:17 - is somewhat unrelated because once I set
62:20 - it to private
62:20 - I just didn't care about the readme
62:22 - anymore but anyway let's let me go
62:37 - yeah I think let me move this over
62:44 - quickly
62:50 - I don't think I have anything in this
62:51 - code that I shouldn't show but just in
62:54 - case okay I do have some stuff about the
62:59 - date here no no but I don't think I
63:04 - actually displayed to the user so I
63:07 - thought I did I thought this is going to
63:08 - be easy and I could just copy and paste
63:10 - some code from a previous site but I
63:15 - don't think it's gonna be that easy
63:16 - it was worth a shot though oh wait a
63:21 - second no I did display it awesome I
63:26 - just have to find where I display it
63:51 - alright let me bring this back over just
63:53 - to show you a bit of the the craziness
63:56 - of this code I don't recommend doing
63:59 - this ever because as you'll see now like
64:03 - trying to go back through this code and
64:05 - figure out what is going on even though
64:06 - I made it all it's just crazy
64:10 - so you see this is just like a really
64:17 - really long file of JavaScript so like
64:23 - if you ever hear people like warn you
64:25 - which I always heard the warnings like
64:27 - you know you don't want to do this and
64:29 - all jQuery you end up with spaghetti
64:31 - code it'll be unmaintainable like I
64:33 - always heard the warnings but I never
64:35 - really saw it like but it does really
64:38 - happen all right so let me I need to
64:49 - find my temp so at some point I have
64:51 - like templates in here so I didn't use a
64:53 - templating library I just use template
64:56 - literals like the es6 template literals
65:00 - to make templates do you see this this
65:07 - whole thing is using I'm pretty sure I
65:12 - use like too here we go here's one part
65:16 - of the template so I was using source
65:17 - set to serve like different size images
65:21 - but I had to first check to make sure
65:24 - that that post actually had an image of
65:26 - that size before I did anything so I end
65:29 - up with lots of stuff like this here we
65:35 - go I know somewhere in here I have the
65:40 - dates
65:54 - you should be alright so I have the
65:57 - category tags and
66:11 - now I can't find it
66:17 - maybe it's down here so I let me know if
66:21 - this is really boring you going through
66:22 - this this really kind of badly written
66:26 - code
66:27 - I'll check the live chat in a second and
66:29 - if if you all don't want to see it I'll
66:31 - quit but um I think I'm really close to
66:37 - finding the point at which I have the
66:40 - date this day any day for this to be
66:43 - done okay I got some date stuff going on
66:49 - yes here it is
66:51 - alright so we're showing a title and
66:55 - then this dates okay
67:10 - all right cool this is gonna be very
67:12 - useful all right so here's what I did so
67:15 - I took the date and I made it I set it
67:19 - to a variable and I've no idea why you
67:21 - let there that definitely could have
67:23 - been cost see you can kind of see like
67:27 - my progression of this was all build
67:31 - this was built less than a year ago so
67:34 - right around this time last year is when
67:36 - I started to build this so this has been
67:38 - less than a year since I've come from
67:41 - jQuery spaghetti code and kind of using
67:45 - es6 but somewhat improperly
67:47 - to now where I'm at now which I think I
67:50 - still have a lot to learn and I still
67:53 - consider myself kind of a newbie in a
67:56 - lot of areas but you definitely see the
67:58 - progress that's always cool if you ever
68:01 - get down on your coding progress just
68:03 - look at something you did you know like
68:05 - a year before or you know even like six
68:07 - months before and then you'll you'll see
68:11 - how far you've come and you'll feel you
68:14 - feel a lot better about your your
68:16 - progress okay so basically what we need
68:19 - to do is take that date we're going to
68:20 - set it all right to a JavaScript date
68:23 - object I think that's how you would you
68:27 - would call it then we're gonna take that
68:31 - and we're just gonna break it out so
68:34 - that I'm gonna take this oh I named it
68:37 - this date right so that that new date
68:40 - that will save as a variable will pull
68:44 - the month out and then the months are
68:47 - actually zero indexed in javascript
68:50 - dates so we do have to add one to the
68:52 - month to get it to display properly then
68:58 - we'll get the the date which would be
69:02 - like the day of the month that's not
69:04 - zero indexed so we can display it
69:08 - normally this is crazy I think
69:10 - JavaScript dates are like the weirdest
69:12 - thing for me that you have some stuff
69:15 - seer index some stuffs not so there's a
69:17 - lot of areas that could trip you up and
69:20 - you wouldn't really know unless you
69:22 - and to read something about it or like
69:25 - like me like I've tried to do it and
69:27 - couldn't figure out why the date was
69:28 - always one month different than it
69:30 - should have been it's just it took me a
69:33 - lot to figure that out and then finally
69:36 - we get the full year so the format is
69:38 - just month / day / year that's a decent
69:45 - format I think I can keep it like that I
69:48 - think I will keep it like that and then
69:50 - that'll be the simplest for me yeah
69:56 - so let me I'm gonna put throw this over
69:58 - on my other screen so I can refer to it
70:00 - let's try to do the same thing but in a
70:04 - nicer way with no jQuery I don't think I
70:09 - actually used any jQuery in that example
70:11 - I just showed you so we can probably use
70:14 - most of it pretty much exactly as is so
70:22 - let's
70:28 - trying to think of whether I want to
70:30 - turn that
70:37 - I think I want to pass it pass the date
70:39 - object in and I think we can do this I
70:43 - think this will be okay so here instead
70:46 - of on post date I want to put it pass in
70:49 - new date and then the post date right
70:58 - this will save us from having to create
70:59 - a separate variable that'll be the date
71:02 - like like I did in the the other example
71:04 - and we'll just pass that and we won't
71:07 - have to create another variable and then
71:09 - on the other side we can just do
71:11 - whatever we want what we need to with it
71:13 - as a date object so hopefully it'll work
71:20 - and so then over here where we have date
71:26 - props date we it's still called the same
71:30 - thing it's still going to be prop state
71:32 - but instead we're gonna do first we're
71:35 - gonna say this actually I think I can
71:46 - copy this whole thing the strattice if I
71:51 - copy this entire thing and I actually
71:56 - put it in a template literal and I move
72:02 - all that this date stuff and turn it
72:04 - into props date
72:12 - then that should work let's check it out
72:21 - did I move it away I think I must yell
72:24 - yeah I've moved it on my other screen
72:25 - obviously but it worked so check it out
72:31 - we have the date the word correctly
72:34 - alright alright I'm gonna check back in
72:37 - with the live chat now that I've
72:39 - succeeded at something hey check the
72:43 - time - okay so probably about like 20
72:46 - more minutes of doing code and then I'll
72:48 - do some question and answer I'm gonna
72:53 - try to find out where I left off in the
72:58 - live chat okay I think I found it
73:10 - all right awesome so
73:20 - adhi says please tell me how to use a
73:23 - java console as the developer tool yes
73:26 - so the JavaScript console
73:27 - oh also from Nepal awesome that's
73:30 - awesome thanks for watching what's the
73:34 - what's the time in Nepal it should be
73:36 - around what like 1:00 a.m. over there
73:40 - something like that
73:42 - if so awesome thanks for watching that
73:48 - late if someone from Guatemala Poland
73:53 - alright yeah my um I have on my wife's
73:58 - side of the family relatives they came
73:59 - from Poland and then on my my one of my
74:03 - grandmother's her parents were were from
74:08 - Poland so really cool I'd like to visit
74:11 - there one day I mean that would be fun
74:14 - coming from Oregon from Sarajevo awesome
74:20 - okay let me get to here let me answer
74:22 - your question I was distracted by all
74:24 - the the places everywhere how much I
74:27 - love learning more about all these
74:29 - places around the world but I actually
74:32 - have never been outside my own country
74:34 - so I mean I'm from the United States
74:37 - says it's quite a large country so I
74:42 - have been to a lot of places within this
74:44 - country but I've never been outside so
74:46 - that way I would really love to one day
74:50 - I'd love to visit everywhere but maybe
74:54 - maybe it'll happen one day I think he'd
74:56 - be really cool to go to a like a
74:58 - JavaScript conference in another country
75:01 - that would be fun maybe like to speak at
75:04 - a conference or something so that gets I
75:05 - get to see the other country and meet
75:07 - all kind of people there and then also
75:09 - like code I would that would be cool so
75:14 - let's let me show you how to use dev
75:17 - tools
75:20 - so hopefully hopefully you're still
75:23 - watching because I think the question
75:25 - was asked quite a while ago like 45
75:27 - minutes ago super easy to use dev tools
75:30 - if you're using Chrome the Chrome
75:31 - browser you just right-click go down to
75:37 - inspect and you click inspect that
75:39 - brings it up once you're in here the
75:41 - first screen you'll see is this which is
75:44 - basically your Dom so it's all your
75:46 - elements on the page if you click on one
75:49 - of the elements you'll have this
75:52 - depending on your screen width it might
75:54 - be configured differently but if you
75:55 - click on one of the elements it'll show
75:57 - you all the Styles associated with it
75:59 - it'll tell you what style sheet that
76:01 - it's from and even what line on that
76:04 - style sheet that these you know see bits
76:10 - of CSS are located in so it's really
76:14 - cool if you don't want to go through it
76:16 - this way you can go this is often
76:18 - helpful for me they just kind of stack
76:20 - them all up here so it's easier to read
76:22 - and then if you click on one then you
76:24 - can see exactly where it came from you
76:26 - also have you know this thing down here
76:29 - is kind of handy you can switch around
76:31 - and see this is your console so you can
76:35 - see warnings and things down here you
76:39 - can even you see a bigger version here
76:42 - if you click this tab and then you can
76:44 - even put things down here so I could do
76:48 - like some JavaScript cause test equals
76:53 - five right and now I can go test and
76:58 - it's five right so I've just done
77:00 - JavaScript and she could write
77:01 - JavaScript in this console and just to
77:05 - test things out so it's really cool
77:07 - there's so many things it would I mean I
77:09 - could do like a month worth of live
77:12 - streams just going over dev tools
77:14 - there's so much stuff in here check out
77:17 - your network requests there's so much
77:20 - stuff but anyway that's like the basic I
77:22 - would say 90% of what I use is all just
77:25 - in this screen right here so anyway hope
77:29 - that was helpful I know it was I mean
77:30 - it's just a few minutes but maybe
77:32 - that'll be good to get you started
77:56 - okay regarding the the question from a
78:01 - long time ago about Zanna had about
78:03 - maybe I could just do some videos where
78:06 - I don't talk and I just code I think she
78:08 - just doesn't like to hear me I'm just
78:10 - joking I don't see no she's asking
78:14 - because basically you like I know
78:16 - obviously can't talk in code all day
78:18 - like it was it's it's a little bit
78:20 - slower to talk when I code and then I
78:22 - would probably lose my voice to be
78:24 - honest with you if I if I try to talk
78:26 - all day in code but so maybe you all
78:29 - would be able to see more of what I do
78:30 - and I just wouldn't worry about talking
78:33 - I would just show my screen so I asked
78:35 - for some feedback from you all about
78:37 - that
78:38 - Rohan said maybe I could just post a
78:43 - recording instead of a live stream
78:44 - that's definitely a possibility as well
78:47 - I said maybe I could do it on Twitch I
78:51 - just I don't want to take up the free
78:53 - code camp YouTube channel for like all
78:55 - day for a really long time in case
78:58 - someone else like Quincy wants to do a
79:02 - live stream of an interview or something
79:05 - Monica says twitch would be cool
79:08 - addy says no please do it on YouTube I
79:10 - don't use to it yeah that's I would have
79:12 - to learn how everything works with
79:14 - twitch so maybe it would be better I
79:15 - have my own channel on YouTube and I
79:19 - hadn't planned on doing live streams on
79:21 - that channel but I could yeah so maybe
79:27 - maybe I'll just do it on that channel
79:45 - okay sign up so then was talking about a
79:50 - sign-up link I think he needs to sign up
79:54 - link for the Udacity course so I will
79:57 - I'll put that in the stream let me look
79:59 - that up on my other screen here let's
80:08 - see oh yeah yeah okay so Sebastian did
80:13 - mention the courses it's five hundred US
80:15 - dollars and I don't know so I'm not sure
80:22 - if the price is different depending on
80:24 - the currency or how they are doing that
80:26 - but it's definitely it's not free I
80:32 - forgot to mention that it's actually
80:37 - yeah it is so I'm gonna put it in the
80:40 - debt right now but it actually is right
80:45 - on the home page it's the very first
80:47 - thing on the home page is a big button
80:51 - that says enroll now to become a react
80:53 - developer so yeah this is actually the
80:58 - first course I've paid for to learn
81:00 - anything
81:02 - coding related in a really really long
81:04 - time I did like a 30 dollar course I
81:07 - think from udemy a few years ago but
81:12 - that's the extent of what I've paid
81:20 - Prince Prince Ali Khan ass how's the
81:23 - Udacity course so far I really like it
81:26 - I'm learning a lot I'm incorporating
81:27 - what I've learned so far into my
81:30 - projects already so that's really cool
81:33 - it's been cool for me it consists the
81:37 - course the the Nanosuit see reacts
81:41 - nanodegree so the nanodegree program
81:44 - consists of three courses so one course
81:48 - you learn like the basics of react I
81:52 - forget what the second course focuses on
81:55 - I think it's like Redux and and things
81:58 - like that and then the third course is
82:00 - react native which lets you build like
82:03 - apps like mobile apps with react so so
82:07 - far I've gone through all the course
82:10 - material for a course one and I'm almost
82:13 - finished with the final project for
82:14 - course one as well so maybe if you're
82:19 - interested I can give you all updates of
82:21 - how the course is going and then if it
82:24 - ends up being good then maybe you want
82:25 - to pay for it but then otherwise you
82:27 - don't you don't have to spend your own
82:28 - money to before you know whether it's
82:30 - good or not I'll let you know but I've
82:32 - been I've been happy with it so far
82:55 - Mohammed Khan says free code can't
82:57 - taught me all the JSI know the outer
83:00 - section was the best well that's really
83:02 - that's kind of cool
83:03 - thanks for saying that okay actually I
83:11 - think I scrolled up a bit too far I must
83:13 - have just passed over some stuff and
83:15 - that's why I thought that I didn't get
83:18 - to that section before but this is no
83:23 - problem I'm glad I saw some of the
83:25 - comments that I had missed oh cool
83:33 - Zanna says she read about a guy on
83:35 - medium that was like 57 or 59 and was
83:39 - becoming a dev so that's really cool
84:00 - you been rusty says hats off to your
84:02 - comment Jesse but I can't remember what
84:04 - I said that would that would deserve a
84:06 - hats off so I wish I would've read that
84:11 - closer to when I said it
84:13 - Janice says sorry Jesse I'm not sure
84:18 - what you were apologizing for I don't
84:21 - think you did anything that you'd have
84:22 - to apologize for
84:35 - yeah there we go okay it says Santa said
84:39 - I should have Adam embedded on my screen
84:41 - or a bot that talks about that would
84:45 - actually be cool I don't know how to do
84:46 - BOTS in the YouTube live chat but that
84:49 - would be cool
84:50 - basically I always get asked like
84:53 - usually multiple times in the live chat
84:55 - what what editor I'm using so it's kind
84:59 - of like a running joke that there will
85:02 - always be a discussion of my code editor
85:05 - I don't mind it I think it's really fun
85:10 - to see how many times I get asked head
85:17 - ok I didn't see Zanna said she have to
85:22 - get had to go and I missed it so she
85:23 - probably can't hear this but thanks
85:26 - thanks for watching hopefully you can
85:30 - join us again tomorrow maybe she'll
85:33 - watch the recording and and hear that
85:51 - okay Manish is saying the the browsers
85:55 - dark github is dark yeah so uh yet I'm
86:01 - using a Chrome extension called
86:07 - tampermonkey and then I load it into
86:11 - tampermonkey some code that's called I
86:14 - think it's called github dark anyway
86:21 - it's so it lets you change the the
86:24 - colors of github so you can go in and I
86:30 - think I have I thought it ended up
86:37 - giving me like an extra there we go it
86:41 - gives you an extra setting panel in here
86:44 - so you can change I haven't even looked
86:48 - at any of these other themes maybe I
86:52 - should check out these other themes at
86:54 - some point I won't mess with it now cuz
86:58 - I'll end up taking a lot of time just
86:59 - looking through that but yeah so
87:02 - tampermonkey is so to get the github
87:04 - dark script so you'd have to install
87:07 - tampermonkey first and then find the
87:09 - github dark script and then use that
87:12 - with tampermonkey but it's really cool I
87:15 - kind of like it
87:23 - okay let's do yeah let's just do a bit
87:29 - more with the code and then I've done a
87:33 - pretty good job of keeping up with a
87:35 - live chat so it might not take that long
87:36 - to go through all the questions but if
87:39 - you if you have any questions for me
87:43 - then
87:44 - go ahead and put them in a live chat now
87:46 - and I'll get to them in a few minutes
87:49 - and we'll just do some some Q&A at the
87:51 - end here but for now let's see what we
87:55 - want to want to do so we have this let's
88:01 - let's do some some basic CSS stuff and
88:03 - that'll be cool because that way if
88:07 - anybody in here is not great with react
88:09 - yet then maybe you're you're better with
88:12 - your CSS skills so it'll be easier to
88:14 - understand so we're just gonna make this
88:17 - date you know kind of sit just right up
88:20 - here a bit and then let's change the
88:23 - color here for our posts for post titles
88:29 - I might drop this down to an h3 I think
88:35 - it's in h2 right now so let's just try
88:38 - to do those three things at least and
88:40 - then they will do some some QA so first
88:45 - thing is let's let's inspect this and
88:51 - see whether it's a margin or padding
88:52 - that we're dealing with so let me shrink
88:56 - this up so I can see so it looks like
88:59 - it's a margin so we have a margin of 30
89:04 - yet and let me see I don't need this
89:09 - down here something to get rid of this
89:11 - okay I think if we set the margin oh the
89:17 - bottom margin is only 24 I think if we
89:19 - set this bottom margin to zero that
89:22 - would work and we'll switch this to an
89:25 - h3 so let's do that
89:34 - and you see here now within react if you
89:38 - want to add a style so in react inline
89:42 - styles are totally fine normally when
89:44 - you're doing HTML usually it's
89:48 - recommended that you don't use n line
89:50 - styles but reacts it's a different story
89:53 - so within that I know I explained this
89:58 - almost every episode but there's there's
90:01 - always new people so I'm probably just
90:04 - going to explain it again because it
90:05 - only takes a minute
90:06 - so within react within this HTML like
90:11 - stuff called JSX we can go into we can
90:14 - use JavaScript so if we want to use
90:15 - JavaScript we just put these curly
90:17 - brackets and now anything inside this
90:19 - first set of curly brackets is
90:20 - JavaScript
90:21 - so inside there we've put in these other
90:23 - these other brackets which of course
90:25 - makes an object in JavaScript so within
90:28 - that object we put our styles and so in
90:31 - this case we're gonna use a margin
90:34 - bottom okay now since we're in
90:38 - JavaScript we're in a camel case right
90:40 - if we left that that hyphenated CSS
90:44 - there like you see here it would think
90:46 - that that's a minus sign and so we don't
90:48 - want that so we're gonna use camel case
90:50 - and just like normal you know normal
90:54 - JavaScript object we put our colon and
90:57 - then in single quotes I'm gonna put 0 is
91:05 - that's what we want our bottom margin to
91:07 - be the maze will change the color while
91:10 - we in here so if you want to do another
91:11 - one we put a comma right because
91:13 - remember this is an object and this
91:16 - click color and we need to grab the red
91:23 - color that we're using for resources so
91:28 - let's go over here grab this color
91:35 - oops forgot to put it there we go
91:40 - alright so that should take care of at
91:45 - least two of the things we wanted to do
91:47 - let's check it out
91:48 - yep there we go so now we have a
91:50 - different color actually that was all
91:54 - three right we wanted to change it yeah
91:56 - we changed it to an h3 yeah that looks a
92:03 - lot better I like that also I kind of
92:09 - wonder if we even need this much space I
92:16 - mean I can work on that maybe I'm
92:18 - getting a little bit too nitpicky here
92:20 - but I think we could probably do without
92:22 - a little space in here maybe like a
92:26 - horizontal rule here that kind of fades
92:30 - so no bill last week gave me sent me
92:34 - some code for doing a really nice
92:37 - horizontal rule that kind of fades so
92:40 - maybe I'll grab that and try to use it
92:42 - here I think that would look really nice
92:44 - just to differentiate between between
92:48 - posts also I need to get I need to work
92:53 - on this part here because obviously
92:56 - that's not how we want it to look but
92:59 - okay so it's about 3:30 Eastern Time and
93:02 - that's when I said that I was going to
93:04 - stop with the code and do the QA so if
93:06 - you were just watching for the coding
93:08 - portion
93:09 - I guess you you know you don't have to
93:12 - stick around anymore thank you so much
93:14 - for watching and I always I'll answer
93:17 - questions on Twitter in the comments of
93:19 - stuff so you know feel free to ask me
93:23 - elsewhere but thanks for watching
93:27 - otherwise if you have time to stick
93:28 - around for the question and answer put
93:30 - your questions in the live chat now and
93:33 - you know feel if you're in the live chat
93:34 - - feel free to answer some of the
93:36 - questions because I certainly benefit
93:39 - greatly from from your advice and your
93:43 - experience as well
93:45 - so let's let's take a look now I'm gonna
93:49 - scroll up I know I answered a lot of
93:51 - stuff already but I know it's I've
93:54 - probably missed a lot as well because
93:58 - I've been scrolling through the chat
94:00 - quite quickly so I'm gonna go through
94:05 - this chat now it's really cool I started
94:13 - saw a lot of new people in in the chat
94:16 - today so that's really cool so if you're
94:19 - new welcome and I really appreciate you
94:25 - checking things out today
94:27 - maybe we usually we have like yeah we
94:32 - have like double the amount of viewers
94:34 - that usually stick around to this point
94:36 - so I don't know what happened maybe I
94:39 - got tweeted or retweeted a lot or
94:42 - something but maybe it's just a good
94:45 - topic people were interested in I hope
94:48 - the topic wasn't too misleading because
94:50 - I kind of didn't really build an entire
94:52 - blog I had some of it like made already
94:55 - but I think I covered a lot of I didn't
94:58 - cover like how you set up WordPress to
95:00 - do this but in terms of how to pull in
95:02 - the data and stuff I covered a decent
95:04 - amount so sometimes it's I don't want to
95:10 - make a title too long so it's hard to
95:11 - explain like exactly what I'm doing
95:14 - but I don't want to be misleading either
95:28 - well I'm scrolling through this now I
95:30 - can see there is quite a bit of of chat
95:34 - going on about code editors
96:02 - okay looks like we did have some people
96:05 - early on asking about reacting what
96:07 - react is and I don't think I really took
96:10 - time to explain that so there was
96:12 - explanation in the live chat so as I'm
96:14 - scrolling through now I'll explain a
96:16 - little bit so the question was asked a
96:20 - long time ago so I'm not sure if the
96:24 - people who are wondering about it or
96:25 - even here but react is like it's a
96:28 - JavaScript framework and it really is a
96:32 - way to build like single page
96:33 - applications but not just that you can
96:35 - build apps with it like mobile apps as
96:37 - well but it allows you to you mix in
96:42 - like HTML and CSS and JavaScript and in
96:46 - a way that you can make these reusable
96:49 - components that if you do it right or
96:51 - really almost completely self-contained
96:53 - and you could use them in different
96:56 - projects like behind the scenes it's
96:58 - also really fast at updating the Dom
97:00 - because it keeps a copy of the DOM and I
97:04 - think they call it a shadow DOM and then
97:07 - when a page when things change on a page
97:11 - JavaScript can do its thing way faster
97:15 - than you can normally refresh the Dom
97:17 - and re-render everything so all that
97:19 - happens in the shadow DOM and then it's
97:22 - compared to the the real Dom on the
97:24 - screen Dom being the document object
97:27 - model that's like all the stuff that
97:28 - goes into your the web page that you see
97:31 - on your screen and it only rear Enders
97:36 - those parts of the dome that have
97:39 - changed so it's able to do things a lot
97:42 - faster because things that would
97:45 - normally require more time to do a
97:47 - complete dawn-marie render now don't
97:49 - take as much time so for sites that have
97:53 - like data changing and updating
97:55 - automatically it's really nice and I
97:58 - would assume you could probably see a
98:00 - performance increase from switching to
98:04 - react or maybe you know technology that
98:07 - might be a bit older so there's a lot of
98:10 - other cool things about react but that's
98:13 - kind of
98:14 - some basic stuff at least in my mind
98:17 - that's what I think of is the main
98:18 - things that stick out to me for for
98:21 - reacts and I should say I'm no expert in
98:24 - react I'm very much learning as I go
98:28 - along so if you'd like a more complete
98:31 - answer maybe somebody else in the chat
98:33 - has given one or you can find maybe you
98:37 - know the react documentation or some
98:39 - other YouTube videos that might be
98:40 - better I know they do a react conference
98:43 - every year and I'm sure some of those
98:45 - talks would be able to explain you know
98:48 - in a lot more depth and in a better way
98:51 - what react is you're from people who
98:54 - actually have worked on building react
99:08 - and Joe says angular seems more
99:11 - complicated to me than react I started
99:13 - learning react just two weeks ago and I
99:14 - already love it more than angular yeah
99:18 - my um my impression of angular is I
99:23 - haven't used angular in a couple years I
99:25 - think I've said this before so I don't
99:29 - have like an up-to-date opinion on
99:31 - angular but when I tried it it was hard
99:33 - for me to learn it was really cool but I
99:38 - couldn't get anything to work but I
99:40 - think that was due to my inexperience
99:42 - with with JavaScript and was setting up
99:45 - a build environment and it didn't have
99:48 - anything to do with angular so I'm not
99:51 - really sure about now angular's come so
99:53 - far since then so I don't I don't really
99:57 - have an opinion on the angular versus
99:58 - react debate
100:26 - okay Sebastian says Jessie check the
100:28 - package language babble and Adam it's
100:31 - for better display for react JSS
100:34 - actually I think I have that on my
100:36 - laptop I'll have to double check because
100:39 - on my laptop I have a different package
100:41 - for displaying everything and it like
100:45 - auto format some things for me in
100:48 - indents so I'll I should have the same
100:52 - packages on both of my computers for
100:56 - consistency so thanks for that it
100:58 - definitely I really do like it on my
101:02 - laptop
101:19 - okay I see now that Adi was thought was
101:22 - talking about the Java console I thought
101:25 - that so Adi had asked about using dev
101:30 - tools with Java and I just assumed that
101:34 - he meant JavaScript but it was really
101:40 - Java so sorry about that well maybe my
101:43 - answer to that question it was helpful
101:44 - for someone but sorry I didn't
101:46 - understand the question
102:10 - okay I'm just scrolling through so I for
102:14 - the the silent silent I'm just I'm just
102:18 - trying to read through this chat make
102:20 - sure I don't miss any of your questions
102:24 - Mohammed asked if this would be up later
102:27 - yes it will so the video may be just a
102:33 - minute or two after I've stopped
102:35 - streaming the video will be available to
102:37 - watch the recording on free code camps
102:39 - channel
102:55 - and I see there's some talk here about
102:57 - people being being newbies at code and
103:01 - stuff so I said before someone asked if
103:06 - if there's anyone else who noob here and
103:08 - I said yeah I'm a noob and I think I'm
103:11 - gonna I'm gonna get like a little bit
103:12 - deep here for a second I honestly think
103:16 - that when I really stop referring to
103:20 - myself as a noob I mean if I went in for
103:23 - a job interview I would you know I would
103:26 - be very confident and say I knew what I
103:27 - was doing but like among other
103:29 - developers and among you all if I ever
103:32 - stop referring to myself as a noob
103:34 - that's the point at which I think I
103:36 - would start stagnating right I would
103:40 - stop learning
103:41 - I think it's cool to have that mentality
103:44 - of a new person because when you're new
103:46 - starting out there's so much to learn
103:49 - and you know there's so much to learn
103:50 - and you're hungry to learn you know
103:52 - you're willing to work hard and learn
103:54 - and I always want to keep that I never
103:58 - want to want to lose that that desire to
104:01 - learn because I think that's that's
104:03 - important if you want to continue to be
104:05 - good and improve yourself so I'm always
104:08 - gonna answer the question like are you a
104:10 - noob I'm going to say yes yes I am
104:13 - because there's always something that I
104:17 - don't know about there's always some
104:19 - some piece of web development that I am
104:22 - a noob at like you can't be good at
104:24 - everything so it's entirely truthful to
104:26 - say I am a noob maybe there are certain
104:28 - things that I've gotten really good at
104:30 - and I couldn't honestly say that I'm a
104:32 - noob at but web development is so huge
104:34 - there's so many different things to
104:36 - learn I think we're all noobs and one
104:39 - way or another so when when I say noob I
104:43 - mean
104:43 - nothing bad about it at all I mean you
104:46 - know it's just a noob is just someone
104:48 - who recognizes that they have a lot to
104:50 - learn and are gonna learn it
104:55 - I'd much rather if I was gonna hire a
104:57 - developer I'd much rather hire someone
104:59 - who's a noob but really really wants to
105:02 - learn and work hard versus someone who's
105:04 - an expert but has just quit learning
105:08 - I don't know if any of you I'm reading
105:17 - through the live chat more but I don't
105:19 - know if anybody has ever seen any of the
105:21 - Rocky movies so like Sylvester Stallone
105:25 - did you know the Rocky Balboa movies or
105:27 - anything but when I think about keeping
105:32 - that idea of like constantly wanting to
105:35 - get better the the song from Rocky 3 the
105:41 - eye of the tiger song always plays in my
105:42 - head like and that spoiler alert really
105:46 - quick so you know don't listen to me for
105:49 - the next couple seconds if you haven't
105:51 - seen Rocky 3 but rocky ends up losing
105:55 - because he's lost that desire to keep
105:57 - getting better and then he ends up
105:59 - winning because he gets it back right so
106:01 - so I I always think about that movie
106:04 - because it's a great like illustration
106:06 - and film of the concept of always
106:09 - needing to keep improving yourself and
106:11 - then the movie the song it's about
106:13 - staying hungry right you want to stay
106:16 - hungry for for learning for getting
106:18 - better
106:32 - okay cabine us i think that's how you
106:37 - pronounce it it said create react app is
106:39 - good for setting up the development
106:41 - environment pretty quickly so not a
106:43 - question but that's a it's a really good
106:45 - really good advice so I want to make
106:46 - sure I read that out so I use next jazz
106:49 - for a lot of my projects but you might
106:51 - not need to use next for your project
106:53 - like if you don't need server-side
106:55 - rendering if you want to do your own
106:56 - setup your own routing you just don't
106:58 - need it then create react app is great
107:01 - I'm actually using it on my project for
107:03 - Udacity so I I'll be I have some
107:08 - experience with both and it's it's
107:10 - definitely a really easy way to get
107:13 - started without having to learn how to
107:15 - use webpack or anything like that it's
107:23 - actually cool some people were putting
107:24 - their their ages in the in the live chat
107:27 - so I want to read some of them out just
107:29 - to give give you an idea of the other
107:32 - people in the chat especially like if
107:34 - you're watching later and you can't see
107:35 - the live chat so we have you know
107:38 - someone's 30 someone's 52 someone's 39
107:42 - 44 someone said that they're 14 I'm 31
107:49 - so someone's 21 to people of all age
107:54 - ranges so if you feel like alienated
108:00 - because of your age there's probably
108:02 - someone else in this chat that is a
108:04 - similar age to use so don't don't feel
108:07 - like you know you have to go it alone
108:09 - and all honestly like we're all
108:12 - different ages and different skill
108:14 - levels and we're all in here in the live
108:15 - chat talking to each other so it doesn't
108:18 - really matter what your age or skill
108:20 - level is you still can you know
108:22 - contribute and you know join in in this
108:26 - kind of little community that we have
108:28 - here
108:58 - okay let's see
109:03 - Rohan is saying I think in in response
109:07 - to talking about doing a lot for the
109:09 - live chat wrote on Ramona's saying that
109:14 - there's like a YouTube API for getting a
109:16 - post in comments that's cool they offed
109:20 - it I won't have time to check it out
109:21 - probably for at least another two weeks
109:23 - but I'm intrigued by the idea of having
109:28 - something like that okay I could see
109:35 - when I was doing the dates you all had
109:37 - some good advice for me for dates so
109:39 - sorry about that I didn't really check
109:41 - the live chat because I knew I had done
109:42 - it before I just needed to find it
109:46 - Manish asks is that the seti thing it is
109:49 - the SETI theme for Adam so SETI SETI
109:52 - thing you someone Vendela said I should
110:02 - search the code for date I actually did
110:05 - but I'd use dates so many times it
110:07 - wasn't really helping me
110:21 - oh cool Andrew said that he's using
110:23 - github dark too from when he saw me use
110:26 - it so that's cool awesome I'm spreading
110:30 - the github dark theme I can't remember
110:33 - where I saw that I mean I it's not like
110:35 - I found it on my own I think I saw
110:37 - another youtuber using it as well and I
110:39 - found out what it was from the comments
110:41 - so I wish I could remember what I saw
110:43 - because I would give credit but I guess
110:47 - that's how it works though you know
110:48 - every everybody gets ideas off of
110:50 - everyone else and then we're all better
110:52 - off for it
110:58 - Patrick said you need some sauce for
111:01 - that code he was referring to all that
111:03 - crazy jQuery code that I had going on at
111:06 - the spaghetti code
111:07 - hey okay we've had some people are
111:15 - mentioning moment js2 use with dates so
111:18 - that's good to know I have to keep that
111:20 - in mind anybody has to work with dates
111:22 - check out moment J s I've heard it heard
111:24 - about it before but I haven't used it so
111:26 - in this case it was some pretty simple
111:28 - date things that I was doing but if I
111:31 - had some more complex things I think it
111:33 - would definitely be worth it to go with
111:34 - with something like mum and Jas
111:52 - I had some other suggestions so
111:56 - date-date FNS a date - FNS is another
112:01 - possibility so I might check it out I
112:04 - mean for right now it's doing what I
112:06 - wanted to do but I might maybe I'll
112:09 - check it out and see if I need to do
112:11 - some more things with dates
112:28 - cool I had asked Adi Adi said so Addie's
112:38 - sorry I was reading some Saudis from
112:41 - Nepal and I had guessed that maybe it's
112:43 - around 1 a.m. and so I was I was pretty
112:46 - close oh there's someone from Phoenix
112:51 - said it's hot in Phoenix
112:53 - I met it is hot I know I haven't been
112:55 - the Phoenix myself but I I know a few
112:57 - people from Phoenix and they've told me
112:59 - stories about how hot it gets so try to
113:02 - stay cool over there now okay Alberto
113:12 - had a great idea I said I didn't really
113:14 - want the date to stand out too much so
113:16 - the idea was making some sort of gray
113:19 - gray color so that's cool maybe I'll
113:21 - just it's black right now so maybe I'll
113:23 - just drop down the opacity a little bit
113:25 - lower I've usually it ends up being a
113:33 - bit more readable if instead of using
113:35 - like a hex color for grey you take black
113:38 - and then drop the opacity to make the
113:42 - grey I don't know why but visually it
113:45 - just looks slightly more readable
113:56 - oh cool all right here's a great tip
113:59 - this this might be the top tip for the
114:01 - day I could see this being really
114:04 - helpful so andrew says when using the
114:07 - react dev tools if you click on a
114:10 - component in the react panel you get a
114:12 - global variable that's dollar sign are
114:15 - referring to that component and you can
114:18 - change the state that's really cool to
114:21 - be able to test things out so thank you
114:23 - for that for that tip Andrew okay
114:31 - there's some questions about the the
114:34 - theme to turn things black so yeah if if
114:43 - you're referring to the chrome inspector
114:45 - like for dev tools it's built into dev
114:48 - tools actually so let me try to find
114:51 - yeah so if you go into dev tools and
114:53 - click on you notice little Settings icon
114:56 - and go down to two settings it has a
115:02 - theme here so you can choose between the
115:04 - light and the dark theme so it's already
115:06 - built in
115:29 - someone asks about the Udacity course to
115:32 - see if it covered Redux I just lost it I
115:38 - want it my my live chat scroll just
115:42 - jumped ups and I can't I don't know
115:46 - where I came right stuff that okay
115:53 - Vendela asks it doesn't cover Redux I'm
115:56 - pretty sure the react Udacity course
115:59 - does cover Redux I haven't gotten to
116:02 - that part yet so I can't say for sure
116:04 - and I can't can't remember but I think
116:07 - it does
116:13 - ok Manish you're still asking about the
116:16 - the github dark theme oh no so it seems
116:28 - as if the link to the github dark is
116:31 - broken
116:32 - that's thanks I wonder let me bring this
116:39 - up for a second
116:43 - yep github
116:52 - remind me later
116:59 - okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna copy and
117:02 - paste this into the into the chat this
117:13 - is the link that I said I have let me
117:19 - see if there's a better one this one
117:23 - should link like directly to some of the
117:28 - code you can see if that if that link
117:33 - will work better
117:41 - they're all and said the chat is
117:42 - unusually active today you're right it
117:44 - is it's like it's crazy how much what's
117:47 - going on I am almost to the bottom
117:50 - though so probably just a few more
117:52 - minutes and then I'll have to wrap it up
117:54 - so I have to get home
118:06 - ayoh says anyone know why the free code
118:10 - can't game of life on code pen doesn't
118:12 - rerender while scrolling I have no idea
118:15 - I don't know if I've ever looked at that
118:16 - so maybe someone else can can answer
118:19 - either the live chat or if you're
118:20 - watching us later maybe in the comments
118:22 - or something
118:35 - okay someone had suggested react
118:37 - fundamentals so yes like react
118:41 - fundamentals calm
118:42 - I lost where the link was but then then
118:45 - it says they don't use es6 so maybe to
118:52 - manage to check out modern react Redux
118:55 - by Stephen gritter so maybe the react
118:59 - fundamentals was a book and I'm just
119:01 - mistaken I haven't checked out either
119:05 - one of those so I can't say for sure but
119:06 - maybe if you want something that does
119:08 - use es6 check out the modern react Redux
119:14 - them says the line between front end and
119:17 - full stack seems blurry after all
119:19 - front-end devs do work on server-side
119:21 - stuff where do you draw a line or it's a
119:25 - gradual progression towards being a full
119:27 - stack engineer yeah that's a really good
119:34 - question I've thought of this before
119:36 - because you're you're right like I I
119:38 - know I mean I've even done on some of
119:41 - the streams some things that are
119:42 - definitely back-end for me so I was I
119:49 - was up for like the possibility of
119:51 - having my title changed and I said for
119:54 - sure I'm you know my my work is
119:57 - front-end development work my reasoning
120:00 - behind it was that I could say maybe
120:03 - like 10% of what I did was back-end work
120:07 - and the other 90% was probably front-end
120:10 - work mixed with design so for me I would
120:14 - I couldn't justify to myself calling
120:16 - myself full stack for me if I got to the
120:21 - point where it was more balanced and I
120:25 - was more knowledgeable about back-end
120:27 - things then I would be more comfortable
120:28 - saying full stack but I think you're
120:32 - right the line is definitely blurry I
120:34 - mean and where do you draw a line if you
120:36 - did 25% back-end and 70% front-end you
120:40 - know is that enough does it have to be
120:42 - closer to 5050 like and I mean everybody
120:44 - does different things maybe one week I
120:46 - think there there are weeks were all go
120:49 - entire week where I'm basically all
120:51 - going back end stuff the almost the
120:53 - whole week and then there are other
120:55 - times where I'll go like a month doing
120:57 - almost nothing with the back end so it
121:01 - is a weird line I would say honestly
121:03 - like whatever whatever job you can get
121:09 - that's what you end up being but
121:10 - whatever title they give you because it
121:12 - really is such a kind of a blurry a
121:15 - blurry line nowadays all right andrew
121:24 - has two questions all wrote grow up
121:28 - before I move on Roland said everyone is
121:30 - full-stack doesn't matter if you like it
121:32 - or not yeah there's definitely some
121:35 - truth in that comment like sometimes you
121:37 - just have to do everything to get a
121:40 - project done so Andrea two questions
121:42 - first question how how you holding XJS
121:45 - for async calls okay so I'm not I think
121:51 - this is what you're talking about are
121:54 - you talking about like when I make the
121:57 - API calls up here if so this get initial
122:02 - props is like if you put stuff in here
122:08 - this will render server side as well I'm
122:11 - not sure if this is what you're asking
122:12 - about or not but I think so and that's
122:19 - that is like a built-in thing into next
122:22 - and there's some documentation on it and
122:25 - their github repo as to how it works out
122:28 - I don't know exactly how it works
122:32 - the next question is did you encounter
122:34 - problems using jQuery and react and
122:36 - Sebastian already answered yes to that
122:39 - one so yeah it's true I did have
122:40 - problems actually I did a stream where I
122:44 - went through some of the problems with
122:47 - with react and jQuery so you can check
122:52 - out that stream if you want a longer
122:53 - explanation but basically yeah the
122:55 - problems found a lot of the problems
122:58 - come from two things one when you change
123:02 - the dawn
123:02 - with jQuery reacts doesn't know about it
123:05 - so you know normally you want to change
123:08 - things in state you know with set state
123:12 - and then react knows and can rerender if
123:14 - you start changing things in the Dom
123:17 - with jQuery it messes up reacts picture
123:22 - of what the Dom is you know that shadow
123:24 - Dom so you don't want to do that the
123:26 - other thing that gets messed up is a lot
123:28 - of the things that you do with jQuery
123:30 - you put inside your document already
123:32 - function well when you're using
123:34 - client-side routing inside react and
123:39 - when you're rerender in components with
123:41 - react some of those triggers that you
123:44 - would normally have trigger inside the
123:47 - document already function don't work so
123:50 - I had to find other ways to call those
123:54 - those things to initialize some of those
123:56 - those features that I was using that the
123:59 - use jQuery so a lot of times I could
124:02 - just do it in inside the component did
124:05 - mount function so it's like that that's
124:10 - a short answer I did a whole stream on
124:13 - how I got around it but it was actually
124:16 - I was able to get pretty much everything
124:19 - working I think that I I wanted to get
124:21 - working but if I had the time I'd like
124:24 - to go in and change everything over so
124:26 - that I'm not using jQuery at all but for
124:29 - now I'm still using some jQuery
124:47 - andrew says it might work their deaths
124:49 - with ten or more years of experiences
124:51 - still don't know all the tricks of death
124:52 - yeah definitely it's like you know you
124:55 - can't ever get to the end of it it's
124:57 - just changing so fast there's new stuff
125:00 - all the time
125:04 - packy says I'm a newbie and I gave three
125:08 - interviews made it to the final round
125:09 - but every time I find new things to
125:11 - learn from an interview says though
125:16 - not not made it through the HR round so
125:19 - cool that's I'm glad that's really good
125:23 - that you're able to learn things from
125:24 - your interview sometimes people get
125:26 - really down about interviews where they
125:28 - didn't get the job like it's a waste but
125:30 - it's definitely not a waste the
125:31 - experience you get is is really good
125:34 - them says you Adrian that's that's from
125:37 - the movie from the Rocky movie I was
125:38 - talking about earlier so so vim knows
125:41 - M's watched it says how to address
125:47 - interview frustration I'm really
125:49 - frustrated I Pike says I'm 25 I started
125:54 - last year I don't know with the
126:01 - interview I mean there's been times when
126:05 - I've been looking for jobs and trying to
126:07 - get you know do interviews and sending
126:09 - out you know a lot of resumes and things
126:11 - and it is really hard to get down you
126:14 - know to get through you get down on
126:15 - yourself a lot so I mean for me this is
126:20 - going to be really kind of general
126:21 - advice but the toughest thing for me was
126:25 - just like you get you get depressed
126:27 - because you can't find a job and then
126:30 - when you're depressed you don't want to
126:32 - do anything so you you stop looking
126:34 - since I get downward spiral where you
126:37 - know you're you don't want to do
126:38 - anything anymore you don't want to send
126:40 - out resumes or go on interviews you're
126:42 - still so down and then it makes it your
126:44 - chances of getting a job even worse so
126:46 - for the most important thing to me is
126:48 - breaking that downward spiral making
126:51 - sure you don't get into it and for that
126:53 - I think things unrelated to even coding
126:57 - or good so like exercise
127:00 - you know doing things that you like
127:02 - hobbies and things just to get your mind
127:06 - out of that negative cycle is good and
127:08 - then in terms of coding stuff like work
127:12 - on side projects that you like to keep
127:14 - up that sense of accomplishment you know
127:17 - contribute to open source projects like
127:19 - every time your pull request gets
127:20 - accepted you'll feel good and like
127:22 - that'll just give you that little lift I
127:24 - think that'll keep you out of you know
127:27 - getting so down on yourself and being
127:29 - depressed and it'll give you a sense of
127:31 - accomplishment so it'll help you going
127:33 - into the interviews because you can go
127:35 - in with confidence with real confidence
127:37 - you know because you have these little
127:39 - successes so that would be my advice I'm
127:42 - sure you know others in the chat and
127:44 - others watching this later on we'll
127:46 - probably have some you know even better
127:47 - advice as well but for me that's always
127:50 - just a struggle for me is you know
127:53 - keeping enough confidence just to keep
127:56 - going and not get into that just
127:58 - sluggishness of you know not wanting to
128:01 - do anything because you get too down on
128:02 - yourself
128:07 - Rowan says when is it not hot in Phoenix
128:10 - so earlier I think it was I think Monica
128:12 - mentioned that it was really really hot
128:14 - in Phoenix so Rowan that's probably I
128:16 - think it is always hot in Phoenix I'm
128:18 - like there may be times where it's
128:21 - slightly cooler but it's still probably
128:23 - hotter in Phoenix all the time than it
128:25 - is you know where I'm from in Ohio
128:43 - yeah Rowan said yeah it is after four
128:46 - well I got carried away okay so I'm
128:48 - gonna wrap it up now because I have to
128:52 - go and take my son to karate so there's
128:57 - a few more questions in there sorry I
129:02 - didn't get to it so if you're still
129:04 - listening and you're like one of the
129:05 - people that have a couple question at
129:07 - the bottom so like umberto is writing
129:10 - something and oh okay Kevin did say I
129:14 - will read this out react Saddam is
129:16 - called virtual Dom shadow Dom as part of
129:19 - web components thank you so much I can I
129:21 - can't ever keep it straight I always mix
129:23 - them up so I apologize before I was
129:25 - calling reacts virtual Dom a shadow DOM
129:28 - and it's not that's something different
129:30 - so the virtual Dom is what react halves
129:34 - so thank you so much for that correction
129:37 - so sorry if I messed up anyone's
129:39 - understanding of this so anyway I do
129:41 - really have to go now I'm sorry I didn't
129:43 - get to all the questions Sebastian I see
129:45 - your question put it in the comments or
129:47 - message me on Twitter or something so I
129:49 - can get back to you on that but anyway
129:53 - thank you so much for watching and I'll
129:55 - be back tomorrow and have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody its Jesse and I hope everyone had a nice weekend and I had I actually did a lot of coding this weekend but not for this project for just a side project for that Udacity course that I'm taking so I wanted to start out by just acknowledging Andrew for his commits so these are all the people who have submitted pull requests to this project appreciate everyone contributing and in this way and I appreciate everyone contributing in the live chat as well in the comments and you all made this project so much better than it would have been if it were just me working on it so anyway Andrew thank you for that and Andrew also had some great ideas to improve the the search function for the resources so I took his ideas and made an issue now I I fully intend to you know do this issue myself at some point but if anybody is interested in this and would like to contribute to a project then this one's up for grabs right now and if you want to learn about you know debouncing then this might be a good one too to start out with alright and I actually had something cool happen right before the stream started and I had like I don't know like ten people waiting and I already had three thumbs up and I hadn't even started yet that was really awesome I don't know if anyone was watching there was one time where I had I had a thumbs down I don't know like ten minutes before I even started and I thought that was hilarious so now that made up for it cuz I had three thumbs up before I even started I appreciate that all right so today I'm gonna be working on this page so I don't know if you've seen this before you might have seen this before cuz I did this a while ago like weeks ago but I never really finished it so right now you can get to it so you can actually go to the live website and if you just type in slash news you can get to it if you click the news button it actually just takes you to the front page and then Scrolls you down there's a news anchor tag to the bottom but this is is actually live it's just not obvious on how to get to it but this is going to end up functioning exactly like a normal blog would function but they're just calling it news so it's basically just gonna display posts and we're gonna have categories and tags and archive so all of this was just hard coded in but what's gonna need to happen is it's gonna need to pull categories tags and tags from WordPress and populate these fields and then we're gonna have to hook this up so that you know when you click one of these it actually changes what appears here the archives will probably have to do I'm not exactly sure left you'll have to figure out something because I can't just I don't think I can just get an API you'll call back to have you know archives I suppose I could make one with a date range that's probably what's gonna happen I think you can make a call to WordPress to get posts within a certain date range that's probably what's gonna happen I mean right now I could grab all the posts immediately and just have filters but eventually if there's a lot of posts then it wouldn't make sense to get every post so it's probably better just to make these be separate API calls and at some point it would be good to set up cashing of API calls because you know people just clicked around back and forth it could end up being a lot so I'd like to have some clientside caching setup as well but probably not gonna get that done today today I think we'll just focus on you know maybe the UI for how these appear and you know possibly getting some categories maybe tags linked up I need to put an image or something up here as well but I'm not worried about that we can just throw in any image for now just to get the idea of what its gonna look like so that's pretty much it I have done made some updates to the new resource section since the last time not a lot but I've just kind of moved code out so I'll take I'll take a second just to show you that I'd have to check out I just checked out the master branch so I don't have it right now so I'll just explain it to you quickly all I did was just take this new it's gonna be hard to explain sorry I might as well just show you so the branch that I'm working on for the new UI is just a new resource UI if you remember I made that last week all right just to show you so anyway I did just a bit okay so basically I I removed a section that was the featured resources it was a big red section so I did this I'm not like under percent sure about this yet but to have this here I still need to initialize the drop down here so there will be a drop down there just move some things around here these are now their own components in a separate file so I added in some data for authors just to give us an idea and then if there is no author data the author doesn't show up so I took a lot of the suggestions that you all had last week and I've incorporated some of them already and there are others that I'm I'm still going to incorporate I didn't have time before the stream today so that's it not really major changes and I'm gonna go back to the master branch now so that we can get started and let me check oops guess I'll have to fix it all right so let me check the live chat really quickly just say hi to everyone while they did a few people here really early kind of seen if anybody's here everyone someone here from India awesome welcome someone from Chile really happy to have you all watching okay Helio says there's some info regarding debounce for the search that's offered in in lodash so off to check that out thank you for that I'll check that out after the after the stream okay Sebastian asked about the date for the post yeah that'll be something that'll need to be added will definitely need with all the normal things that you would expect from you know from a blog will want to put in there with the exception of probably we won't need author because they're you know these are just going to be quick like news announcements and things so they're not gonna be exactly like a normal blog post at least for right now so I think we can leave out the author but other than that will want to have the date Nima des what you see of course you're doing I'm doing the react course the one that just came out so if anybody else is doing the react course from Udacity then let me know and so far I'm I'm almost done with the first project it's it's the book like a book app if anyone is interested it's on my my github page it it should be you know kind of right at the top I can't remember what I called it but if you want to check out what I'm doing for that cool it is there it's almost finished I haven't done anything with the UI though but in terms of functionality pretty much done I just need to link up react router so that everything has like the forward and back functionality works Oh someone from Norway Hey all right cool so hey everyone I'm gonna get started now I'll try to keep an eye on the chat while I'm going but if you watch before you know how it is sometimes you get into the code maybe a few minutes before I get to check again but at the end I will do I'll answer some questions I need to make sure I end just a heads up I need to end this before 400 because my son has my oldest son has karate lessons at 500 so I'll probably have to leave around 4 o'clock so maybe 330 I'll start wrapping things up eastern time this is all Eastern time so probably do like an hour and a half of coding and then maybe a half hour of questionandanswer so I mean that's that's a decently long stream we'll try to get as much done as we can so I'm starting to feel the pressure a bit we only have till the 20th of this month to get pretty much everything done that's in the Trello board for this project that I have linked up in the description so like everything in these first three columns needs to be done and then potentially anything from this column that I need also needs to be done so it's a lot of stuff so I may be I was hoping I wouldn't have to work extra this week but I might have to it's possible there might be some extra long streams coming they do this week okay if you have if you have someone from Germany someone from South Korea awesome Zanna says ouch that's a lot chance when do you have the time I'm just gonna have to work a lot that's right so I mean my normal work day is like seven hours of work and I'll just have to work a lot more than that and and get it done it's possible some of the things on that list could just wait and you know maybe they're not absolutely necessary so off I'll go through the list later in the week and really make sure that everything on there is absolutely necessary but otherwise to just I have to get it I have to get it done and they I'm gonna move on to another project after that so in like two weeks we'll be we'll be working on something different in you know for the streams so let me get out of these are the resources oh no this isn't it so I did switch over I prepared a little bit today for the stream I got got this up so as you can see like like I said this is all hardcoded so we're gonna have to pull this in and populate these lists from from the API this mate instead of being a list this may end up being a dropdown because if there's a lot of categories I don't want a giant list of categories the tags I might end up making this like you know like you know you see like the tag cloud where the tags that are used most often or bigger I think that would be kind of cool so maybe y'all when you get the data from the API it tells you how many times the tag has been used so if we link that piece of data up to the font size then we should be able to make it so each tag the tag font size for each tag is based on the number of times that tag is used will obviously have you know lower limit at an upper limit so the font stays readable at the lower end and it's not too big on the higher end but I think that would be a cool feature not necessary though that might be one of the things that only happens if we have time and probably won't get to this today in terms of you know the dates also that you know the dates are not going to be necessary at first anyway there's just not gonna be enough enough posts to really warrant really any of these these things are necessary at first because there's only gonna be a few posts but what will work if we can so first things first let's get some of those normal blog things in the display and we'll probably want to take this out and make it its own component we're gonna add stuff it's gonna start to get bigger better just to move it out of here so why don't we do that first so I'm gonna go in case you're not that familiar with the command line I'm gonna switch over to the command line and I'm gonna go type in touch and then components all right so if you're on the command line and you want to create a new file you use the command touch this is on a Mac and I haven't used a command line on a PC and so long I can't remember which commands are the same or not so possible that the commands I'm using here won't work but but just in case that you're kind of new with the command line this is how you create a file and I'm gonna make it in the components folder so right now I'm in the the just the base folder for this project I need to go into the components folder and inside that folder I want to make a new component called blog j/s so now if I go back over to the project you see see if I can zoom I never figured out there we go all right I'll zoom in here so you can see stuff in in my editor at least stuff in green is are things that have been added that are new so now we've just added this blog j/s file all right so it might seem like why would I want to type that out when I could have just gone here and said you know give me a new new file and I could have just done it there after a while and you start using the command line it actually ends up being faster to just do more through the command line so if you're new to it probably nothing is faster than the command line right now but if you get used to it it's way faster than any graphical interface for a lot of things I even do image editing through the command line now and I prefer that to any type of graphical editing so anyway enough enough of that but I like to go into some of those little details occasionally because if people of all skill levels watching so don't want to leave people behind with something that it's simple to me now because I've been using it for so long but I remember when I first started like anything on the command it's just like a mystery to me and everybody on YouTube that was just flying through commands like it just seems so awesome so we're gonna make this a component and I'd like to make this a stateless functional component so I haven't done this yet on any of the any of the streams but basically it's it's a kind of a slightly shorter way to make a component then what we have been using and you can't use it all the time but if you have a component like this where it's basically not doing much at all i mean it it's just gonna take some props and display it and that's about it nothing else is really gonna be happening oops I thought I had the news thing up oh well so but first thing we're gonna do is import react from let me double check it from react okay that's what I thought it was these stuff in the top I never type out I'm always just copy and pasting it so I have to double check what I'm using it so now we're gonna say Const and we're gonna call this blog equals and let me I'm actually gonna double check I'm gonna bring up on my other screen my project do I have it here there we go this is from my project for the Udacity course I'm gonna put on the other screen so this is where I learned this stuff from the course so it's I'm trying to use what I'm learning immediately so don't forget it so I'm gonna bring it up on the screen so I get all the syntax right because I don't want to waste your time with me messing up the syntax trying to seem like I know this stuff by heart when I really don't alright so basically this is it we just have to export and that's it that's all we need so let me compare this to another kind of similar component so let's check out like this resource card so basically doing the same thing there they're just taking in some props and displaying it now of course the resource cards has a bit more here but look at what we have so the import is slightly different because we're important component but up here you know we believe make a class right and then we have this render function and then we have to say with the return within there okay and then we export so basically we're getting rid of the render and the return this is slightly shorter this line is get rid of a few brackets and then we end up having something that's a lot a lot cleaner looking so not really like a really huge difference but it looks a bit nicer also you all show you in a second the way we call on these props is slightly different than what we do so we'll say like this props you don't need this anymore within here you can just say props so that's the only that's really the only big difference in terms of what you're going to do within within here all right so let's bring this I lost my news page here it is so let's bring the news here we go that's actually weird this is I highlighted this div and it's giving me it's I think I messed that up and never knew about it so I did i made this weeks ago but it seems like I need to have another another div inside of here right oh I know what happened okay this still works actually I remember thinking the same thing now weeks ago so I'm just closing this div since it's I'm just gonna make a div here and then that way it won't keep tricking my editor and in a week I won't forget again and have it confuse me okay so let's just copy this and I can get rid of get rid of it because we're gonna pull it in as a component and we need to slug title when you make sure we pull in the same props that it needs so we need to get the slug we need to pull in a title we need the content also we're gonna need to pull in the date and obviously I don't remember what the date format is and so we'll probably have to do something with the format of the date to make it more presentable but for now it was a day we need the slug title and content alright so here we're going to bring in his component blog and then we're gonna pass in the props that we had before to let me since we're gonna be working on both of these let's move this blog component over here so we can see them side by side let me know if this font is too small I'll make sure I'll check back in like 30 seconds in the live chat if it's too small for you I can definitely I can make it bigger it's it's comfortable right now for me but if it's too small for you I can definitely make it bigger so let's bring in slug slug and we need a title title rendered oops I got the equal sign and if you're not familiar with react and a lot of this is over your head I apologize in previous videos I have taken a little bit more time to explain this so if you if you want to watch me explain it you can kind of check out some of the titles of the videos and titles that would talk about specifically about react components will probably have the best explanation but I don't really think that my videos are the best to get kind of a tutorial so you might want to you know check out the docs and for react or check out some other videos or courses on react to get a better idea of what's kind of going on here I'll do my best to explain it so right now we are passing in what are called props so that this component here can use all the data that we're pulling in in this component this we're going to pass on that data through props it's the last one we need is content right yeah we always want to make sure we close it so all the HTML like tags in react when you're using JSX have to be closed you'll get an error otherwise so make sure you you're closing everything and that looks good we we do need to make sure that we're importing this because right now this component will have no idea what we're talking about because we haven't imported it so let's go up here and we're gonna import actually I'm just gonna copy this paste it and change this to the log oops so now it's importing the component blog from the folder components blog you don't have to put the dot je s at the end it knows that all these are going to be JavaScript files so now what should happen is when I save this I'll actually want em so we didn't change anything over here but when I change this to reflect these names of these props it should everything should look exactly the same as it did before so I just need to to change this and instead of post it's gonna be props so props slug and and then also we don't need rendered right since we're bringing in we're already bringing in the rendered version of this content and this this is not like some special command this is just the way the JSON file is formatted that comes from WordPress okay so now I'll save this file and I'll save this file and let's check out and see what the site looks like yay it still looks the same so I'll refresh just to be sure usually we get a you know an instant refresh actually good thing I refreshed it looks like my dev server is up here just click my dev server has quit working once again hmm I is not defined uhoh looks like I forgot something oh the key okay so I was bringing in a key and it was just an iterator so I need to pass that in I forgot about that so let's pass in the key and this will be I and then here it should work we'll just need to put it in drops dot I so in react if you're going to be you know iterating over components and rendering the same component over and over again each one has to have a unique key it doesn't have to be unique to your whole react application but has to be unique among those sibling components so in this case you know it's just the the iterator so it's just gonna be like 0 1 2 3 4 all right but we could each each of these posts will have their own ID that's been given to it from WordPress so we could use that if we needed to but we don't really need to need that so since we wouldn't I would normally pull in the wordpress ID of something if i was only gonna use it for the key but if i needed it for something else then i probably just use it for the key all right so now it works so now we can see we have this and just to kind of show you in dev tools react so if you are doing anything with react I highly recommend getting the react extension for dev tools I have no idea how I initially got this it's been too long so I can't remember but I'm sure I know it wasn't difficult to load up on here so let's see news first here we go so we have blog just to show you the name of the component now as it is using the blog component and you can see we have these props are being passed so this is the content being passed we have this love the title so it's working exactly how we wanted to I'm gonna check the live chat since it's been quite a while since I checked it Wow everyone in the live chat has been busy this is this huge since there's so much activity the live chat I'll say it right now if you ask a question early on and I don't get to it there's a chance that I might not ever see it because when the chat gets really big the stuff that the comments that came earliest I can't read them anymore they're just gone so if I do miss your question and you stick around for the Q&A at the end you can just ask it again or you can put it in the comments to this video or you can message me on Twitter and I'll answer it I'll answer it then okay so I scrolled back up to the last place I looked oh yes people from Austria Romania Albania awesome Venezuela that's awesome I love hearing where where you all are from I think it's a really fun that it's really fun that so many people from all over the world in different time zones are all coming together and you know there's just so much nice interaction the live chat you all helped me out a lot it's just really cool oh there is some talk in the live chat about the the link to my Udacity project yeah and I didn't even think about it but yeah so this project this react CI is underneath FUS marcom so it's Franciscan University of student ville marketing department my page let me go to my profile what's mine mine is Jessie our Weigel so what I'm talking about is this one this my read starter project so sorry about that I totally forgot that I had had the other project under a different no what do they call one I can't remember organization is how they call it an organization account anyway yes I haven't even changed the readme or anything yet I just I just was like trying to focus and work through and get all the functionality down before I mess with anything else because it's so easy to get caught up in the the UI and you know trying to make the reaming everything that I thought this is gonna take me forever I just want to make sure I get it done alright okay cool and Sebastian had already put in the live chat the the link that I just showed you so I should have just scrolled down a bit as Anna said could you sometimes just film your editor while you code without being distracted by talking to us I would look at that I mean if you don't have the time for talking okay I never thought about doing that I always figured that would be boring but yeah I love to think about that so yeah let me know what you all think the suggestion was I made I don't have time and it's true like I don't have I couldn't do this all day because it does take extra time to do the talking and things I think it's it's really valuable for me because I get so many great ideas but it does it slows things down a bit so there's a lot of things that need done that I know how to do it it just it needs to get done and they're not really you know fun to watch I would I would say so I don't record them but maybe if you all would be interested in seeing some recordings which are basically me just working not talking I might be interested in that I don't know that I would take up the free code camp channel with all that all day in case you know occasionally there are some I know Quincy does some live interview sometimes so I wouldn't want to be a you know on all the time so I'd either do it either like on my channel my youtube channel or maybe I'd get like a twitch channel or something to do that sort of thing but I'm I'm open for that if you alright I get I would kind of feel bad not talking to anybody but I guess if you're interested I would I'd be fine with that vim Rossi asks is there any difference in commands for Ubuntu or Mac I don't really I've never come across any difference not not to say that there aren't any differences maybe there are I but I have personally never seen any difference between Mac and Linux commands okay wrote Rohan is getting deep on me here and say saying you are using a PC you aren't using Windows says even modern Mac's our pcs technically technically all Macs are IBM pccompatible so yes so good distinction roll on so on Windows the commands are different yeah let's not vim Brasi says don't start Mac versus windows here yeah I didn't mean to start I mean I don't care if in the live chat you have discussions about you know whatever as long as it's you know not not being mean to anybody I guess but yeah I don't mean to argue I own several PCs and a Mac and I have a Chromebook and I run I don't have a Linux you know computer that I use but I use Linux on my servers so so I can see the benefits and all of them they all have good things about them although anymore the only thing that I use Windows for really is for gaming and I don't really have that much time for gaming now at all I'd probably been months since I've played a computer game you know on a Windows computer okay Andrew R asks about the Udacity course link yeah I guess I can post it do you mean specify first do you mean the link to like sign up and register for the course or are you talking about the link to my project for the course if it's the link to my project it already has been put in the chat by Sebastian a little bit higher up in the chat if it's the link to the Udacity course I could give you a link but I think they're really pushing the course a lot right now so I think the homepage for Udacity would you just be Udacity calm I'm pretty sure that they have it on the homepage at least they did at one point I know there's discussion there's always a discussion about the editor always us I wonder how long you can keep it going that like there's gonna be discussing about the editor and every single every single time I stream which is cool I'm not gonna get into the discussion I just noted somebody did ask about whether it was still slow i I think the Adam editor to me at least to seem like it has gotten faster than it was it's still not as fast like Visual Studio code seems faster to me it's possible that's just because I have a lot more plugin it's going for Adam but in general vs code seems faster but Adam seems way faster than it did when I first got it which was a few years ago I think I started using Adam like when it when it first came out really close to it so it was quite slow at one time adhi I'm not sure how to pronounce it's a Adi says am I the only new beer you're not the only new beer I I'm a new Santa says we're all react noobs that's why we're here some are more advanced yeah ok I'll I'll make sure I'd try to do a better job of explaining things for those who are not familiar with react and it looks like there's some good explanation going on in a live chat as well so thank you all for for taking the time to explain that to the people who aren't familiar with it oh cool Zanna it said she finished the code academy code academy react course react 1 awesome I went through those when they first came out I don't know if they have more I want to check again to see if they've added on to the course or anything if there's more to do but I remember it being pretty helpful unfortunately after I took that course I didn't have a project that I was doing in react so I forgot most of what I had learned in that course but I think it all kind of sticks around in longterm memory so it's the next time I tried to learn it I get caught on quicker ok almost almost through with the with the live chat I got to try to look back more frequently so I don't have these giant periods where I'm taking a break from coding I think it just might be better for those of you watching it's possible there are some people that don't really care about the latch and just want to see the code Mohammed Khan ass is it worth doing the Codecademy course for me I think it was worth it it's somewhat depends on how advanced you are with react and how you like to learn best I found it to be I find most of the codecademy things to be like a lot of like really I can holding step by step and I often don't know enough at the end to really do a project on my own but it helps me to get that little bit of confidence and knowledge of things without having to commit to like setting up my own development environment for it and everything so I think it's worthwhile it might slightly be a waste of time if you're you know more than just the beginner at react you may pick up a few things but it might not really be worth it if you already know a bit so but I I thought when I did it that it was worthwhile but I was really really new at react to the point where like I I knew you know almost nothing I had just seen some people use it at a conference and knew enough to knew that I wanted to know more but that was it okay all right looks like Jax's doesn't mind listening to the the to the chat me revisiting the chat so okay cool alright she also have some people talking about the best training courses for react so someone mentioned free cocaine yeah free code camp is good to learn your basic JavaScript I haven't checked out the new free code camp so there's a beta version of free code camp that I think does go and more it does a lot more with react I haven't looked at the beta version for a really long time like months and months so I don't know I can't speak personally about what it's what it's like but I'm pretty sure it has some stuff for reacting you can check out the beta stuff now so if you like free code camp you can check out the react stuff from free code camp alright so let me go back now I've gotten through a lot of the live chat I skipped over some stuff I'll come back later on and really look through it but I think I got the important questions when I go back to the live chat really what I want to do is make sure anybody especially who's new that I make sure I address the questions because I know you know those of you who watch for a long time I'm sure you're okay if I miss something at some point and but I don't want new people to feel ignored especially if they're know not only new to this channel but you know they're also new to coding so I want to make sure that everybody's everybody is addressed you know at least at some point especially if I see something like a new person that I haven't haven't seen before in the live chat so hey or somebody joining in IT engineer join in so hey thanks for watching breakpoint recommends the official react tutorial so yeah check that out I can't believe I forgot to mention that yeah the react like the react.js website has a tutorial to go through so that would also be cool dealing for that is you you do set up your development environment on your own computer from there so if you're not comfortable with that part of it then maybe you'd want to do something that's more in browser like Codecademy free code camp stuff browserbased first to get you comfortable but if you're already comfortable setting up a dev environment then yeah the react course the react to toriel is is great ok one more from the live set before we get started so vim Rossi says I'm 30 years old Nubian web development D recruiters have age bias when hiring I don't know that I actually I'm not sure that I can answer that you know accurately from what I have heard there's a lot of people in the free code camp forum and also on medium the do blog posts and talk about their experience getting hired and almost everybody that I read about getting hired is older than 30 it's just especially lately it seems like everyone that's writing about being able to get a job is older than 30 so it seems like maybe there's maybe there's not they're getting a job but that's entirely you know anecdotal I don't have any data to back up anything like that but it looks like I'm 31 right now I got hired something I was like 28 or 29 when I got hired so not you know right around 30 so at least for me I was able to get hired and I hope that there's not a lot of age bias because if I want to if I ever want to switch and get a job somewhere else I'm definitely gonna be older then am now so I'll probably you know be older than 30 for sure so anyway I don't really know maybe if someone else has some some better insight into the world of recruiters you could you know kind of contribute there in the live chat all right so let's let's go back actually just reminded me my my dad told me yesterday that he's gonna retire in September the end of September I think he's 57 now and I told him I was asking him what he's gonna do any retires and I said you wanna learn how to be a developer I said I could teach you how to do stuff and so he said his you know he's 57 and he's gonna I don't think he's gonna really learn how to be a developer but I'll try I'll try to see if you know even if he doesn't want to get a job as a developer he'd be cool to be able to talk about the stuff with my dad but I really think he could I told him he'd get a lot of publicity if he published his journey to becoming a developer after a retiring I think that would be a cool story I told him I tell everybody on Twitter about it if he did do it but all right okay I had a reminder for a meeting so normally on Mondays I have this meeting at 300 p.m. but today my department head came in and asked for the data that I was supposed to give in the meeting and I had already put it into a spreadsheet and it was already raised she said okay you don't have to come to the meeting which is awesome because I need all the time I can get for this project and that means I get to do a longer stream which which is really great I was actually kind of in a kind of a down mood all day until I started the stream so thank you everyone for helping improve my my mood just had some some bad stuff happen in my in my family this weekend so I was just kind of about that but let's get back to this let's go let's put in a date so let's see what format we're gonna get when we try to pull this date in and we'll try to reformat it in a way that's a little bit easier to read if we need to if I want to switch this order right now cuz it'll keep bothering me so I'd like to keep the code in the middle so I can just quickly kind of move move the screens okay so we're gonna be working first we need to pull in the dates okay so right now we are just getting posts and I'm pulling in all everything so we should be able to bring in the date I'm gonna check the kind of the raw API data and so we can check out what we have to work with and I'll bring it over here on this screen so y'all can see it as well all right so this is all the data that we have to work with right now when we get we pull in posts so it looks like we have so we have a date and this is the date format so we definitely need to change this format quickly I'm just gonna kind of look through and see if there's any other data that we probably should be putting in there Oh actually I'm wondering if I should pull in any any images into this view I don't think I'm going to right now just because I have such a short amount of time to get this all done I I think I kind of like well I mean the way it looks right now listen great but I can see what it will end up looking like kind of in my mind and I think I like it without the images we'll see if I need to put in the images later on I will when for certainly when people click to go and you know when a user clicks and goes into the main you know single post page and images can be there but on this page I think it might be nice to not have them oh we are gonna need the categories yeah we need to bring in categories because we want to set up some filters before when people click on these different categories so normally in a blog setup like if this were just a wordpress blog you'd click on a category and there'd actually be an entire page for those categories I don't think that's necessary for this that does give the advantage of having an actual link someone could go to but it's it's really rare that you could share a link to a category page on a blog so I think I mean you can let me know I just I never bookmark or share links to category pages on blogs so maybe maybe people do and I'm just not aware of it I just glanced back at the latest comment from Elaine I'm sorry I really didn't feel bad if I mess up your name it's al AI n says I have no idea that you can react in WordPress so yes I mean technically it's not a wordpress site I'm just pulling in data from a wordpress site that's on a different server but you could actually use react like within a wordpress theme I've never done it I've seen I've seen some stuff on github of people doing it and I'm pretty sure they've done it successfully but I've never tried to do it I always just thought you know if I'm gonna use react I'm gonna do you know an entirely separate react site but maybe there are some advantages to doing it you know more like the traditional WordPress theme route I'm just not really aware of them okay we need to make sure we we pull an announcement I don't think we're going to need to mess with us right now so basically the there are two types they're going to be news and there's gonna be announcements I'm not entirely sure what the difference is between news and announcements it doesn't really matter for what I'm doing though because I'm not gonna be entering in content but it's possible that we could do we would want to put tabs for news and announcement but I don't think so I think it'd be fine to just put things you know right just right in order on the home page they will be separated from news and announcements so I'm not I'm not too worried about it and I'm not sure that a user coming to the site would know all right well what's the news with falls under news what falls under announcements I don't know that it would actually be useful to anyone to be able to filter by news and announcements these categories are gonna be better and then we will probably put in a search function somewhere and that will be more okay sorry I'm just doing a lot of thinking out loud here and not a lot of coding but I guess it's better to do this first than to have to code everything over and over again because of changing my mind halfway through okay so I think we're we're good let's pull in the date we'll just stick is one step at a time I feel like I just planned out everything for this page all at once and we haven't gotten much done so let's pull in the date first and then let's convert this date this was actually be cool to do because dates always drive me crazy I've successfully worked with them and displayed them before but I always forget how I did it so I'll have to look up some previous projects because I'm pretty sure on a previous site I took a date in that exact same format from WordPress and then displayed it in a more user friendly way I think I did off the double check all right so let's pull in first we're gonna pass in the date like if you remember we're getting the data from WordPress the WordPress API here and the news component and this news component is our entire news page and then we're grabbing the data here and then we're passing that data to our blog component and we're passing it as a prop or as you know multiple props so let's go date and we're gonna say post date so now we're gonna pass that in will now have access to date here within our blog component so we're gonna put the date let me look quickly maybe the date could go right underneath the title we'll see how that looks really I mean it's gonna go either above the time below the title probably the best places to put it so we'll try below first here's our title it's an h2 and it is it's wrapped in a link tag let's make this we just put into this a span and we're definitely gonna style it so that it's it shows up but for now we'll just put it in here as from date okay so this is just the test to make sure we've imported it properly it's obviously gonna look there you go like this alright so first things first let's get this reformat it we are also going to want to move it up a bit I don't mind the size it's kind of small but I'm fine with that because I don't really want the date to be the focus so I'd like it to be smaller than the title and the excerpt but I would like to move it up so that it sits right under here so we'll probably a lot of this this padding is more this is probably because of the H text we'll probably need to set some styles on this H tag to bring this up but first let's get this date going so first thing I'm going to do is check out a project where I use this previously actually I can go here it's already open I did a project this is a private repository right now so unfortunately you won't be able to check it out it's got to be private because the entire website is private well I thought it was I thought I had worked on it there is so actually this is an interesting phrase I could show this project more maybe with I redo it one day I'll convert it to react but this is the same concept I'm pulling data from the WordPress API but instead of doing it with react I made the entire UI and all the interactions and everything with jQuery so I really wish I could show you just like how insane the code is even the routing so like the URLs all work each post has its own URL every time you do a search it has its own URL every category everything so it's insane and the readme is somewhat unrelated because once I set it to private I just didn't care about the readme anymore but anyway let's let me go yeah I think let me move this over quickly I don't think I have anything in this code that I shouldn't show but just in case okay I do have some stuff about the date here no no but I don't think I actually displayed to the user so I thought I did I thought this is going to be easy and I could just copy and paste some code from a previous site but I don't think it's gonna be that easy it was worth a shot though oh wait a second no I did display it awesome I just have to find where I display it alright let me bring this back over just to show you a bit of the the craziness of this code I don't recommend doing this ever because as you'll see now like trying to go back through this code and figure out what is going on even though I made it all it's just crazy so you see this is just like a really really long file of JavaScript so like if you ever hear people like warn you which I always heard the warnings like you know you don't want to do this and all jQuery you end up with spaghetti code it'll be unmaintainable like I always heard the warnings but I never really saw it like but it does really happen all right so let me I need to find my temp so at some point I have like templates in here so I didn't use a templating library I just use template literals like the es6 template literals to make templates do you see this this whole thing is using I'm pretty sure I use like too here we go here's one part of the template so I was using source set to serve like different size images but I had to first check to make sure that that post actually had an image of that size before I did anything so I end up with lots of stuff like this here we go I know somewhere in here I have the dates you should be alright so I have the category tags and now I can't find it maybe it's down here so I let me know if this is really boring you going through this this really kind of badly written code I'll check the live chat in a second and if if you all don't want to see it I'll quit but um I think I'm really close to finding the point at which I have the date this day any day for this to be done okay I got some date stuff going on yes here it is alright so we're showing a title and then this dates okay all right cool this is gonna be very useful all right so here's what I did so I took the date and I made it I set it to a variable and I've no idea why you let there that definitely could have been cost see you can kind of see like my progression of this was all build this was built less than a year ago so right around this time last year is when I started to build this so this has been less than a year since I've come from jQuery spaghetti code and kind of using es6 but somewhat improperly to now where I'm at now which I think I still have a lot to learn and I still consider myself kind of a newbie in a lot of areas but you definitely see the progress that's always cool if you ever get down on your coding progress just look at something you did you know like a year before or you know even like six months before and then you'll you'll see how far you've come and you'll feel you feel a lot better about your your progress okay so basically what we need to do is take that date we're going to set it all right to a JavaScript date object I think that's how you would you would call it then we're gonna take that and we're just gonna break it out so that I'm gonna take this oh I named it this date right so that that new date that will save as a variable will pull the month out and then the months are actually zero indexed in javascript dates so we do have to add one to the month to get it to display properly then we'll get the the date which would be like the day of the month that's not zero indexed so we can display it normally this is crazy I think JavaScript dates are like the weirdest thing for me that you have some stuff seer index some stuffs not so there's a lot of areas that could trip you up and you wouldn't really know unless you and to read something about it or like like me like I've tried to do it and couldn't figure out why the date was always one month different than it should have been it's just it took me a lot to figure that out and then finally we get the full year so the format is just month / day / year that's a decent format I think I can keep it like that I think I will keep it like that and then that'll be the simplest for me yeah so let me I'm gonna put throw this over on my other screen so I can refer to it let's try to do the same thing but in a nicer way with no jQuery I don't think I actually used any jQuery in that example I just showed you so we can probably use most of it pretty much exactly as is so let's trying to think of whether I want to turn that I think I want to pass it pass the date object in and I think we can do this I think this will be okay so here instead of on post date I want to put it pass in new date and then the post date right this will save us from having to create a separate variable that'll be the date like like I did in the the other example and we'll just pass that and we won't have to create another variable and then on the other side we can just do whatever we want what we need to with it as a date object so hopefully it'll work and so then over here where we have date props date we it's still called the same thing it's still going to be prop state but instead we're gonna do first we're gonna say this actually I think I can copy this whole thing the strattice if I copy this entire thing and I actually put it in a template literal and I move all that this date stuff and turn it into props date then that should work let's check it out did I move it away I think I must yell yeah I've moved it on my other screen obviously but it worked so check it out we have the date the word correctly alright alright I'm gonna check back in with the live chat now that I've succeeded at something hey check the time okay so probably about like 20 more minutes of doing code and then I'll do some question and answer I'm gonna try to find out where I left off in the live chat okay I think I found it all right awesome so adhi says please tell me how to use a java console as the developer tool yes so the JavaScript console oh also from Nepal awesome that's awesome thanks for watching what's the what's the time in Nepal it should be around what like 100 a.m. over there something like that if so awesome thanks for watching that late if someone from Guatemala Poland alright yeah my um I have on my wife's side of the family relatives they came from Poland and then on my my one of my grandmother's her parents were were from Poland so really cool I'd like to visit there one day I mean that would be fun coming from Oregon from Sarajevo awesome okay let me get to here let me answer your question I was distracted by all the the places everywhere how much I love learning more about all these places around the world but I actually have never been outside my own country so I mean I'm from the United States says it's quite a large country so I have been to a lot of places within this country but I've never been outside so that way I would really love to one day I'd love to visit everywhere but maybe maybe it'll happen one day I think he'd be really cool to go to a like a JavaScript conference in another country that would be fun maybe like to speak at a conference or something so that gets I get to see the other country and meet all kind of people there and then also like code I would that would be cool so let's let me show you how to use dev tools so hopefully hopefully you're still watching because I think the question was asked quite a while ago like 45 minutes ago super easy to use dev tools if you're using Chrome the Chrome browser you just rightclick go down to inspect and you click inspect that brings it up once you're in here the first screen you'll see is this which is basically your Dom so it's all your elements on the page if you click on one of the elements you'll have this depending on your screen width it might be configured differently but if you click on one of the elements it'll show you all the Styles associated with it it'll tell you what style sheet that it's from and even what line on that style sheet that these you know see bits of CSS are located in so it's really cool if you don't want to go through it this way you can go this is often helpful for me they just kind of stack them all up here so it's easier to read and then if you click on one then you can see exactly where it came from you also have you know this thing down here is kind of handy you can switch around and see this is your console so you can see warnings and things down here you can even you see a bigger version here if you click this tab and then you can even put things down here so I could do like some JavaScript cause test equals five right and now I can go test and it's five right so I've just done JavaScript and she could write JavaScript in this console and just to test things out so it's really cool there's so many things it would I mean I could do like a month worth of live streams just going over dev tools there's so much stuff in here check out your network requests there's so much stuff but anyway that's like the basic I would say 90% of what I use is all just in this screen right here so anyway hope that was helpful I know it was I mean it's just a few minutes but maybe that'll be good to get you started okay regarding the the question from a long time ago about Zanna had about maybe I could just do some videos where I don't talk and I just code I think she just doesn't like to hear me I'm just joking I don't see no she's asking because basically you like I know obviously can't talk in code all day like it was it's it's a little bit slower to talk when I code and then I would probably lose my voice to be honest with you if I if I try to talk all day in code but so maybe you all would be able to see more of what I do and I just wouldn't worry about talking I would just show my screen so I asked for some feedback from you all about that Rohan said maybe I could just post a recording instead of a live stream that's definitely a possibility as well I said maybe I could do it on Twitch I just I don't want to take up the free code camp YouTube channel for like all day for a really long time in case someone else like Quincy wants to do a live stream of an interview or something Monica says twitch would be cool addy says no please do it on YouTube I don't use to it yeah that's I would have to learn how everything works with twitch so maybe it would be better I have my own channel on YouTube and I hadn't planned on doing live streams on that channel but I could yeah so maybe maybe I'll just do it on that channel okay sign up so then was talking about a signup link I think he needs to sign up link for the Udacity course so I will I'll put that in the stream let me look that up on my other screen here let's see oh yeah yeah okay so Sebastian did mention the courses it's five hundred US dollars and I don't know so I'm not sure if the price is different depending on the currency or how they are doing that but it's definitely it's not free I forgot to mention that it's actually yeah it is so I'm gonna put it in the debt right now but it actually is right on the home page it's the very first thing on the home page is a big button that says enroll now to become a react developer so yeah this is actually the first course I've paid for to learn anything coding related in a really really long time I did like a 30 dollar course I think from udemy a few years ago but that's the extent of what I've paid Prince Prince Ali Khan ass how's the Udacity course so far I really like it I'm learning a lot I'm incorporating what I've learned so far into my projects already so that's really cool it's been cool for me it consists the course the the Nanosuit see reacts nanodegree so the nanodegree program consists of three courses so one course you learn like the basics of react I forget what the second course focuses on I think it's like Redux and and things like that and then the third course is react native which lets you build like apps like mobile apps with react so so far I've gone through all the course material for a course one and I'm almost finished with the final project for course one as well so maybe if you're interested I can give you all updates of how the course is going and then if it ends up being good then maybe you want to pay for it but then otherwise you don't you don't have to spend your own money to before you know whether it's good or not I'll let you know but I've been I've been happy with it so far Mohammed Khan says free code can't taught me all the JSI know the outer section was the best well that's really that's kind of cool thanks for saying that okay actually I think I scrolled up a bit too far I must have just passed over some stuff and that's why I thought that I didn't get to that section before but this is no problem I'm glad I saw some of the comments that I had missed oh cool Zanna says she read about a guy on medium that was like 57 or 59 and was becoming a dev so that's really cool you been rusty says hats off to your comment Jesse but I can't remember what I said that would that would deserve a hats off so I wish I would've read that closer to when I said it Janice says sorry Jesse I'm not sure what you were apologizing for I don't think you did anything that you'd have to apologize for yeah there we go okay it says Santa said I should have Adam embedded on my screen or a bot that talks about that would actually be cool I don't know how to do BOTS in the YouTube live chat but that would be cool basically I always get asked like usually multiple times in the live chat what what editor I'm using so it's kind of like a running joke that there will always be a discussion of my code editor I don't mind it I think it's really fun to see how many times I get asked head ok I didn't see Zanna said she have to get had to go and I missed it so she probably can't hear this but thanks thanks for watching hopefully you can join us again tomorrow maybe she'll watch the recording and and hear that okay Manish is saying the the browsers dark github is dark yeah so uh yet I'm using a Chrome extension called tampermonkey and then I load it into tampermonkey some code that's called I think it's called github dark anyway it's so it lets you change the the colors of github so you can go in and I think I have I thought it ended up giving me like an extra there we go it gives you an extra setting panel in here so you can change I haven't even looked at any of these other themes maybe I should check out these other themes at some point I won't mess with it now cuz I'll end up taking a lot of time just looking through that but yeah so tampermonkey is so to get the github dark script so you'd have to install tampermonkey first and then find the github dark script and then use that with tampermonkey but it's really cool I kind of like it okay let's do yeah let's just do a bit more with the code and then I've done a pretty good job of keeping up with a live chat so it might not take that long to go through all the questions but if you if you have any questions for me then go ahead and put them in a live chat now and I'll get to them in a few minutes and we'll just do some some Q&A at the end here but for now let's see what we want to want to do so we have this let's let's do some some basic CSS stuff and that'll be cool because that way if anybody in here is not great with react yet then maybe you're you're better with your CSS skills so it'll be easier to understand so we're just gonna make this date you know kind of sit just right up here a bit and then let's change the color here for our posts for post titles I might drop this down to an h3 I think it's in h2 right now so let's just try to do those three things at least and then they will do some some QA so first thing is let's let's inspect this and see whether it's a margin or padding that we're dealing with so let me shrink this up so I can see so it looks like it's a margin so we have a margin of 30 yet and let me see I don't need this down here something to get rid of this okay I think if we set the margin oh the bottom margin is only 24 I think if we set this bottom margin to zero that would work and we'll switch this to an h3 so let's do that and you see here now within react if you want to add a style so in react inline styles are totally fine normally when you're doing HTML usually it's recommended that you don't use n line styles but reacts it's a different story so within that I know I explained this almost every episode but there's there's always new people so I'm probably just going to explain it again because it only takes a minute so within react within this HTML like stuff called JSX we can go into we can use JavaScript so if we want to use JavaScript we just put these curly brackets and now anything inside this first set of curly brackets is JavaScript so inside there we've put in these other these other brackets which of course makes an object in JavaScript so within that object we put our styles and so in this case we're gonna use a margin bottom okay now since we're in JavaScript we're in a camel case right if we left that that hyphenated CSS there like you see here it would think that that's a minus sign and so we don't want that so we're gonna use camel case and just like normal you know normal JavaScript object we put our colon and then in single quotes I'm gonna put 0 is that's what we want our bottom margin to be the maze will change the color while we in here so if you want to do another one we put a comma right because remember this is an object and this click color and we need to grab the red color that we're using for resources so let's go over here grab this color oops forgot to put it there we go alright so that should take care of at least two of the things we wanted to do let's check it out yep there we go so now we have a different color actually that was all three right we wanted to change it yeah we changed it to an h3 yeah that looks a lot better I like that also I kind of wonder if we even need this much space I mean I can work on that maybe I'm getting a little bit too nitpicky here but I think we could probably do without a little space in here maybe like a horizontal rule here that kind of fades so no bill last week gave me sent me some code for doing a really nice horizontal rule that kind of fades so maybe I'll grab that and try to use it here I think that would look really nice just to differentiate between between posts also I need to get I need to work on this part here because obviously that's not how we want it to look but okay so it's about 330 Eastern Time and that's when I said that I was going to stop with the code and do the QA so if you were just watching for the coding portion I guess you you know you don't have to stick around anymore thank you so much for watching and I always I'll answer questions on Twitter in the comments of stuff so you know feel free to ask me elsewhere but thanks for watching otherwise if you have time to stick around for the question and answer put your questions in the live chat now and you know feel if you're in the live chat feel free to answer some of the questions because I certainly benefit greatly from from your advice and your experience as well so let's let's take a look now I'm gonna scroll up I know I answered a lot of stuff already but I know it's I've probably missed a lot as well because I've been scrolling through the chat quite quickly so I'm gonna go through this chat now it's really cool I started saw a lot of new people in in the chat today so that's really cool so if you're new welcome and I really appreciate you checking things out today maybe we usually we have like yeah we have like double the amount of viewers that usually stick around to this point so I don't know what happened maybe I got tweeted or retweeted a lot or something but maybe it's just a good topic people were interested in I hope the topic wasn't too misleading because I kind of didn't really build an entire blog I had some of it like made already but I think I covered a lot of I didn't cover like how you set up WordPress to do this but in terms of how to pull in the data and stuff I covered a decent amount so sometimes it's I don't want to make a title too long so it's hard to explain like exactly what I'm doing but I don't want to be misleading either well I'm scrolling through this now I can see there is quite a bit of of chat going on about code editors okay looks like we did have some people early on asking about reacting what react is and I don't think I really took time to explain that so there was explanation in the live chat so as I'm scrolling through now I'll explain a little bit so the question was asked a long time ago so I'm not sure if the people who are wondering about it or even here but react is like it's a JavaScript framework and it really is a way to build like single page applications but not just that you can build apps with it like mobile apps as well but it allows you to you mix in like HTML and CSS and JavaScript and in a way that you can make these reusable components that if you do it right or really almost completely selfcontained and you could use them in different projects like behind the scenes it's also really fast at updating the Dom because it keeps a copy of the DOM and I think they call it a shadow DOM and then when a page when things change on a page JavaScript can do its thing way faster than you can normally refresh the Dom and rerender everything so all that happens in the shadow DOM and then it's compared to the the real Dom on the screen Dom being the document object model that's like all the stuff that goes into your the web page that you see on your screen and it only rear Enders those parts of the dome that have changed so it's able to do things a lot faster because things that would normally require more time to do a complete dawnmarie render now don't take as much time so for sites that have like data changing and updating automatically it's really nice and I would assume you could probably see a performance increase from switching to react or maybe you know technology that might be a bit older so there's a lot of other cool things about react but that's kind of some basic stuff at least in my mind that's what I think of is the main things that stick out to me for for reacts and I should say I'm no expert in react I'm very much learning as I go along so if you'd like a more complete answer maybe somebody else in the chat has given one or you can find maybe you know the react documentation or some other YouTube videos that might be better I know they do a react conference every year and I'm sure some of those talks would be able to explain you know in a lot more depth and in a better way what react is you're from people who actually have worked on building react and Joe says angular seems more complicated to me than react I started learning react just two weeks ago and I already love it more than angular yeah my um my impression of angular is I haven't used angular in a couple years I think I've said this before so I don't have like an uptodate opinion on angular but when I tried it it was hard for me to learn it was really cool but I couldn't get anything to work but I think that was due to my inexperience with with JavaScript and was setting up a build environment and it didn't have anything to do with angular so I'm not really sure about now angular's come so far since then so I don't I don't really have an opinion on the angular versus react debate okay Sebastian says Jessie check the package language babble and Adam it's for better display for react JSS actually I think I have that on my laptop I'll have to double check because on my laptop I have a different package for displaying everything and it like auto format some things for me in indents so I'll I should have the same packages on both of my computers for consistency so thanks for that it definitely I really do like it on my laptop okay I see now that Adi was thought was talking about the Java console I thought that so Adi had asked about using dev tools with Java and I just assumed that he meant JavaScript but it was really Java so sorry about that well maybe my answer to that question it was helpful for someone but sorry I didn't understand the question okay I'm just scrolling through so I for the the silent silent I'm just I'm just trying to read through this chat make sure I don't miss any of your questions Mohammed asked if this would be up later yes it will so the video may be just a minute or two after I've stopped streaming the video will be available to watch the recording on free code camps channel and I see there's some talk here about people being being newbies at code and stuff so I said before someone asked if if there's anyone else who noob here and I said yeah I'm a noob and I think I'm gonna I'm gonna get like a little bit deep here for a second I honestly think that when I really stop referring to myself as a noob I mean if I went in for a job interview I would you know I would be very confident and say I knew what I was doing but like among other developers and among you all if I ever stop referring to myself as a noob that's the point at which I think I would start stagnating right I would stop learning I think it's cool to have that mentality of a new person because when you're new starting out there's so much to learn and you know there's so much to learn and you're hungry to learn you know you're willing to work hard and learn and I always want to keep that I never want to want to lose that that desire to learn because I think that's that's important if you want to continue to be good and improve yourself so I'm always gonna answer the question like are you a noob I'm going to say yes yes I am because there's always something that I don't know about there's always some some piece of web development that I am a noob at like you can't be good at everything so it's entirely truthful to say I am a noob maybe there are certain things that I've gotten really good at and I couldn't honestly say that I'm a noob at but web development is so huge there's so many different things to learn I think we're all noobs and one way or another so when when I say noob I mean nothing bad about it at all I mean you know it's just a noob is just someone who recognizes that they have a lot to learn and are gonna learn it I'd much rather if I was gonna hire a developer I'd much rather hire someone who's a noob but really really wants to learn and work hard versus someone who's an expert but has just quit learning I don't know if any of you I'm reading through the live chat more but I don't know if anybody has ever seen any of the Rocky movies so like Sylvester Stallone did you know the Rocky Balboa movies or anything but when I think about keeping that idea of like constantly wanting to get better the the song from Rocky 3 the eye of the tiger song always plays in my head like and that spoiler alert really quick so you know don't listen to me for the next couple seconds if you haven't seen Rocky 3 but rocky ends up losing because he's lost that desire to keep getting better and then he ends up winning because he gets it back right so so I I always think about that movie because it's a great like illustration and film of the concept of always needing to keep improving yourself and then the movie the song it's about staying hungry right you want to stay hungry for for learning for getting better okay cabine us i think that's how you pronounce it it said create react app is good for setting up the development environment pretty quickly so not a question but that's a it's a really good really good advice so I want to make sure I read that out so I use next jazz for a lot of my projects but you might not need to use next for your project like if you don't need serverside rendering if you want to do your own setup your own routing you just don't need it then create react app is great I'm actually using it on my project for Udacity so I I'll be I have some experience with both and it's it's definitely a really easy way to get started without having to learn how to use webpack or anything like that it's actually cool some people were putting their their ages in the in the live chat so I want to read some of them out just to give give you an idea of the other people in the chat especially like if you're watching later and you can't see the live chat so we have you know someone's 30 someone's 52 someone's 39 44 someone said that they're 14 I'm 31 so someone's 21 to people of all age ranges so if you feel like alienated because of your age there's probably someone else in this chat that is a similar age to use so don't don't feel like you know you have to go it alone and all honestly like we're all different ages and different skill levels and we're all in here in the live chat talking to each other so it doesn't really matter what your age or skill level is you still can you know contribute and you know join in in this kind of little community that we have here okay let's see Rohan is saying I think in in response to talking about doing a lot for the live chat wrote on Ramona's saying that there's like a YouTube API for getting a post in comments that's cool they offed it I won't have time to check it out probably for at least another two weeks but I'm intrigued by the idea of having something like that okay I could see when I was doing the dates you all had some good advice for me for dates so sorry about that I didn't really check the live chat because I knew I had done it before I just needed to find it Manish asks is that the seti thing it is the SETI theme for Adam so SETI SETI thing you someone Vendela said I should search the code for date I actually did but I'd use dates so many times it wasn't really helping me oh cool Andrew said that he's using github dark too from when he saw me use it so that's cool awesome I'm spreading the github dark theme I can't remember where I saw that I mean I it's not like I found it on my own I think I saw another youtuber using it as well and I found out what it was from the comments so I wish I could remember what I saw because I would give credit but I guess that's how it works though you know every everybody gets ideas off of everyone else and then we're all better off for it Patrick said you need some sauce for that code he was referring to all that crazy jQuery code that I had going on at the spaghetti code hey okay we've had some people are mentioning moment js2 use with dates so that's good to know I have to keep that in mind anybody has to work with dates check out moment J s I've heard it heard about it before but I haven't used it so in this case it was some pretty simple date things that I was doing but if I had some more complex things I think it would definitely be worth it to go with with something like mum and Jas I had some other suggestions so datedate FNS a date FNS is another possibility so I might check it out I mean for right now it's doing what I wanted to do but I might maybe I'll check it out and see if I need to do some more things with dates cool I had asked Adi Adi said so Addie's sorry I was reading some Saudis from Nepal and I had guessed that maybe it's around 1 a.m. and so I was I was pretty close oh there's someone from Phoenix said it's hot in Phoenix I met it is hot I know I haven't been the Phoenix myself but I I know a few people from Phoenix and they've told me stories about how hot it gets so try to stay cool over there now okay Alberto had a great idea I said I didn't really want the date to stand out too much so the idea was making some sort of gray gray color so that's cool maybe I'll just it's black right now so maybe I'll just drop down the opacity a little bit lower I've usually it ends up being a bit more readable if instead of using like a hex color for grey you take black and then drop the opacity to make the grey I don't know why but visually it just looks slightly more readable oh cool all right here's a great tip this this might be the top tip for the day I could see this being really helpful so andrew says when using the react dev tools if you click on a component in the react panel you get a global variable that's dollar sign are referring to that component and you can change the state that's really cool to be able to test things out so thank you for that for that tip Andrew okay there's some questions about the the theme to turn things black so yeah if if you're referring to the chrome inspector like for dev tools it's built into dev tools actually so let me try to find yeah so if you go into dev tools and click on you notice little Settings icon and go down to two settings it has a theme here so you can choose between the light and the dark theme so it's already built in someone asks about the Udacity course to see if it covered Redux I just lost it I want it my my live chat scroll just jumped ups and I can't I don't know where I came right stuff that okay Vendela asks it doesn't cover Redux I'm pretty sure the react Udacity course does cover Redux I haven't gotten to that part yet so I can't say for sure and I can't can't remember but I think it does ok Manish you're still asking about the the github dark theme oh no so it seems as if the link to the github dark is broken that's thanks I wonder let me bring this up for a second yep github remind me later okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna copy and paste this into the into the chat this is the link that I said I have let me see if there's a better one this one should link like directly to some of the code you can see if that if that link will work better they're all and said the chat is unusually active today you're right it is it's like it's crazy how much what's going on I am almost to the bottom though so probably just a few more minutes and then I'll have to wrap it up so I have to get home ayoh says anyone know why the free code can't game of life on code pen doesn't rerender while scrolling I have no idea I don't know if I've ever looked at that so maybe someone else can can answer either the live chat or if you're watching us later maybe in the comments or something okay someone had suggested react fundamentals so yes like react fundamentals calm I lost where the link was but then then it says they don't use es6 so maybe to manage to check out modern react Redux by Stephen gritter so maybe the react fundamentals was a book and I'm just mistaken I haven't checked out either one of those so I can't say for sure but maybe if you want something that does use es6 check out the modern react Redux them says the line between front end and full stack seems blurry after all frontend devs do work on serverside stuff where do you draw a line or it's a gradual progression towards being a full stack engineer yeah that's a really good question I've thought of this before because you're you're right like I I know I mean I've even done on some of the streams some things that are definitely backend for me so I was I was up for like the possibility of having my title changed and I said for sure I'm you know my my work is frontend development work my reasoning behind it was that I could say maybe like 10% of what I did was backend work and the other 90% was probably frontend work mixed with design so for me I would I couldn't justify to myself calling myself full stack for me if I got to the point where it was more balanced and I was more knowledgeable about backend things then I would be more comfortable saying full stack but I think you're right the line is definitely blurry I mean and where do you draw a line if you did 25% backend and 70% frontend you know is that enough does it have to be closer to 5050 like and I mean everybody does different things maybe one week I think there there are weeks were all go entire week where I'm basically all going back end stuff the almost the whole week and then there are other times where I'll go like a month doing almost nothing with the back end so it is a weird line I would say honestly like whatever whatever job you can get that's what you end up being but whatever title they give you because it really is such a kind of a blurry a blurry line nowadays all right andrew has two questions all wrote grow up before I move on Roland said everyone is fullstack doesn't matter if you like it or not yeah there's definitely some truth in that comment like sometimes you just have to do everything to get a project done so Andrea two questions first question how how you holding XJS for async calls okay so I'm not I think this is what you're talking about are you talking about like when I make the API calls up here if so this get initial props is like if you put stuff in here this will render server side as well I'm not sure if this is what you're asking about or not but I think so and that's that is like a builtin thing into next and there's some documentation on it and their github repo as to how it works out I don't know exactly how it works the next question is did you encounter problems using jQuery and react and Sebastian already answered yes to that one so yeah it's true I did have problems actually I did a stream where I went through some of the problems with with react and jQuery so you can check out that stream if you want a longer explanation but basically yeah the problems found a lot of the problems come from two things one when you change the dawn with jQuery reacts doesn't know about it so you know normally you want to change things in state you know with set state and then react knows and can rerender if you start changing things in the Dom with jQuery it messes up reacts picture of what the Dom is you know that shadow Dom so you don't want to do that the other thing that gets messed up is a lot of the things that you do with jQuery you put inside your document already function well when you're using clientside routing inside react and when you're rerender in components with react some of those triggers that you would normally have trigger inside the document already function don't work so I had to find other ways to call those those things to initialize some of those those features that I was using that the use jQuery so a lot of times I could just do it in inside the component did mount function so it's like that that's a short answer I did a whole stream on how I got around it but it was actually I was able to get pretty much everything working I think that I I wanted to get working but if I had the time I'd like to go in and change everything over so that I'm not using jQuery at all but for now I'm still using some jQuery andrew says it might work their deaths with ten or more years of experiences still don't know all the tricks of death yeah definitely it's like you know you can't ever get to the end of it it's just changing so fast there's new stuff all the time packy says I'm a newbie and I gave three interviews made it to the final round but every time I find new things to learn from an interview says though not not made it through the HR round so cool that's I'm glad that's really good that you're able to learn things from your interview sometimes people get really down about interviews where they didn't get the job like it's a waste but it's definitely not a waste the experience you get is is really good them says you Adrian that's that's from the movie from the Rocky movie I was talking about earlier so so vim knows M's watched it says how to address interview frustration I'm really frustrated I Pike says I'm 25 I started last year I don't know with the interview I mean there's been times when I've been looking for jobs and trying to get you know do interviews and sending out you know a lot of resumes and things and it is really hard to get down you know to get through you get down on yourself a lot so I mean for me this is going to be really kind of general advice but the toughest thing for me was just like you get you get depressed because you can't find a job and then when you're depressed you don't want to do anything so you you stop looking since I get downward spiral where you know you're you don't want to do anything anymore you don't want to send out resumes or go on interviews you're still so down and then it makes it your chances of getting a job even worse so for the most important thing to me is breaking that downward spiral making sure you don't get into it and for that I think things unrelated to even coding or good so like exercise you know doing things that you like hobbies and things just to get your mind out of that negative cycle is good and then in terms of coding stuff like work on side projects that you like to keep up that sense of accomplishment you know contribute to open source projects like every time your pull request gets accepted you'll feel good and like that'll just give you that little lift I think that'll keep you out of you know getting so down on yourself and being depressed and it'll give you a sense of accomplishment so it'll help you going into the interviews because you can go in with confidence with real confidence you know because you have these little successes so that would be my advice I'm sure you know others in the chat and others watching this later on we'll probably have some you know even better advice as well but for me that's always just a struggle for me is you know keeping enough confidence just to keep going and not get into that just sluggishness of you know not wanting to do anything because you get too down on yourself Rowan says when is it not hot in Phoenix so earlier I think it was I think Monica mentioned that it was really really hot in Phoenix so Rowan that's probably I think it is always hot in Phoenix I'm like there may be times where it's slightly cooler but it's still probably hotter in Phoenix all the time than it is you know where I'm from in Ohio yeah Rowan said yeah it is after four well I got carried away okay so I'm gonna wrap it up now because I have to go and take my son to karate so there's a few more questions in there sorry I didn't get to it so if you're still listening and you're like one of the people that have a couple question at the bottom so like umberto is writing something and oh okay Kevin did say I will read this out react Saddam is called virtual Dom shadow Dom as part of web components thank you so much I can I can't ever keep it straight I always mix them up so I apologize before I was calling reacts virtual Dom a shadow DOM and it's not that's something different so the virtual Dom is what react halves so thank you so much for that correction so sorry if I messed up anyone's understanding of this so anyway I do really have to go now I'm sorry I didn't get to all the questions Sebastian I see your question put it in the comments or message me on Twitter or something so I can get back to you on that but anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll be back tomorrow and have a great day
