00:06 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:08 - with jesse i'm jesse and today we're
00:11 - going to keep doing some styling as you
00:13 - can see
00:14 - we've got a lot of work to do
00:17 - so not exactly the best ui
00:20 - sorry i was a few minutes late
00:22 - i uh
00:24 - didn't realize how much
00:27 - setup i would need i didn't realize my
00:28 - computer had turned off and things had
00:31 - updated so it just took me a few extra
00:32 - minutes
00:34 - um
00:36 - so let me give you a quick update
00:38 - um
00:40 - you may hear my kids in the background
00:41 - they're about to leave for school so let
00:44 - me give you a quick update before we
00:45 - start with the coding uh just on what's
00:47 - going on
00:49 - so
00:50 - i was recently at the
00:53 - star trek
00:55 - conference so that's in columbus uh it's
00:58 - a tech conference um
01:00 - so
01:01 - i unexpectedly gave a talk on
01:04 - react native web and i used this project
01:08 - as an example i'm gonna give um
01:13 - the same talk next week at ndc
01:16 - minnesota so if i know anybody in
01:18 - minnesota and you want to meet up
01:21 - i'll be there most of next week
01:24 - so let me know
01:26 - and uh
01:28 - one thing i i realized is when i'm using
01:31 - this project to display like
01:34 - to demonstrate what's going on
01:36 - we haven't built for
01:38 - um for mobile yet so i can't demonstrate
01:41 - that now there is
01:43 - there is an issue with that
01:45 - so i really want to use expo
01:48 - but currently expo does not support
01:52 - um
01:54 - the context
01:56 - is it the context api or hooks
01:59 - one of those two i can't remember
02:03 - but basically we're doing stuff right
02:05 - now
02:06 - that is not supported by expo so we have
02:10 - to wait until that support comes out so
02:13 - um
02:15 - we could
02:17 - possibly just build
02:21 - um for react native like build for
02:23 - mobile with just regular react native
02:26 - and not worry about expo
02:28 - i've done that before like that's a
02:30 - possibility so
02:31 - we may do that just wanted to give you
02:33 - an update on where i'm at was coming up
02:35 - and uh what the plans are for this
02:37 - project but no matter what
02:40 - today we're gonna work on styling
02:44 - okay uh let me say hi to everyone and
02:46 - see what's up in the chat before we get
02:48 - started
02:50 - chas white cases why the long face
02:53 - uh no reason i just put
02:56 - they were talking about this picture i
02:58 - put on the thumbnail where i i don't
03:00 - really look that happy
03:03 - i just looked through my photos and
03:05 - picked one that i hadn't used yet and
03:06 - that was the first one i found so
03:10 - um
03:11 - i think i took that last week so that's
03:13 - not
03:15 - not feeling sad today
03:17 - um
03:19 - everybody's saying hello good morning uh
03:21 - benjamin asks how i'm doing uh actually
03:23 - not too bad not too bad i'm uh
03:26 - i think i might be coming down with
03:27 - something i woke up with a sore throat
03:30 - and a stuffy nose but hopefully
03:32 - it's nothing too bad since i gotta
03:34 - travel next week
03:38 - all
03:44 - right okay
03:46 - let me let me get started and anybody
03:49 - that's asking questions in the chat i'll
03:50 - get back to your questions very soon so
03:52 - i'm gonna set this timer
03:54 - and um
03:59 - when this timer goes off i'm gonna go
04:00 - back to the live chat and answer uh as
04:03 - many questions as i can
04:07 - all right so let's see
04:08 - let's get rid of that it's not running
04:12 - um first off
04:15 - let me
04:17 - i'm gonna go to the contributors page
04:20 - just to uh give a shout out to everybody
04:22 - that's contributed so far uh so i like
04:24 - to put this up here you know
04:26 - occasionally just to let everybody know
04:29 - uh
04:29 - you know who's been contributing so
04:31 - thank you to everyone who's contributed
04:33 - so far
04:34 - definitely um
04:36 - welcome any uh any pull requests you may
04:38 - have
04:40 - all right let's let's go to the code
04:42 - first things first always start your day
04:45 - off with a get pool
04:48 - oh looks like
04:50 - oh okay so i did update uh
04:53 - the gh pages so that's the the link
04:57 - in
05:00 - so if we go to the project and click on
05:04 - this link
05:06 - you can actually check out the project
05:08 - here
05:11 - so i'm going to put that link in the
05:12 - description
05:15 - so you just check it out you know right
05:17 - now
05:19 - but that's updated so i
05:22 - i didn't realize that it was still
05:23 - running an older version
05:25 - uh so i updated that over the weekend
05:29 - and
05:32 - it's back to our code
05:35 - okay
05:36 - also usually just run yarn as well or an
05:39 - npm install
05:40 - now i i know that there were no packages
05:43 - pulled down but
05:45 - just in case
05:47 - sometimes i forget maybe i installed a
05:49 - package on another computer like that
05:52 - way we're all set i've already started
05:54 - the development server
05:59 - and
06:00 - so we're good to go
06:03 - so right
06:04 - now
06:06 - a lot of our stuff basically our entire
06:08 - app for the most part is split between
06:10 - this app producer.js and app.js
06:15 - so
06:17 - in terms of
06:21 - our styles we can see most of our styles
06:24 - are here
06:26 - in app.js
06:28 - all right and i apologize in advance i'm
06:30 - gonna yawn a lot i didn't have any
06:32 - caffeine yet so
06:35 - uh it's gonna happen i'm sorry
06:40 - uh so yeah here's our styles right we
06:43 - have it in the form of javascript
06:45 - objects
06:47 - we're using the stylesheet.create that
06:50 - comes with react native
06:54 - okay so let's
06:56 - figure out exactly what we're gonna do
06:59 - what we're gonna try to get done in this
07:00 - stream uh so the last stream we did some
07:03 - work with the submit button basically we
07:06 - made this bigger let me go
07:09 - let's shrink this down to what size the
07:12 - hundred percent size
07:14 - um so that we get a good idea
07:16 - um
07:18 - when you shrink it down to this size
07:21 - it does seem like the proportions are a
07:23 - bit off right
07:25 - but uh what i'd really like to do
07:28 - is
07:29 - make these boxes
07:32 - look different
07:33 - right it's not obvious what these even
07:36 - are right now okay so
07:39 - ideally what i would love to find is an
07:42 - svg
07:43 - an open source svg
07:47 - and it has a little icon that looks like
07:51 - a hero right and enemies
07:55 - so that's what i love to put in here not
07:58 - sure if we're going to find that
08:02 - but let's just do a quick search
08:04 - if we don't find anything in the first
08:05 - like minute or two then we'll just move
08:07 - on to something else
08:09 - but
08:10 - hopefully we can find something suitable
08:12 - for this
08:13 - uh also it might be kind of cool to
08:17 - have different backgrounds show up
08:23 - like i'm thinking depending on what's
08:25 - going on maybe we have different
08:26 - backgrounds so uh
08:29 - instead of just a message that shows up
08:32 - it could be
08:33 - remember this is a kids game right so we
08:35 - want to try to be visual and not rely on
08:37 - text-based things as much
08:39 - so potentially like images or graphics
08:42 - would show up for victory for defeat um
08:46 - getting a question right getting it
08:48 - wrong
08:51 - okay so let's check out um
08:56 - free svg
09:05 - character icons i don't know
09:08 - trying to think of the best way to do
09:10 - this oh
09:14 - that might work
09:29 - all right let's just check out
09:31 - a few of these
09:36 - all right that's that's not bad
09:39 - let's visit that
09:42 - whoa okay
09:48 - all right not bad let's see how this how
09:50 - we would actually go about loading this
09:52 - uh
09:54 - trying to find one i like
09:56 - i guess it doesn't matter let's just
09:58 - pick whatever because i want to see
10:04 - and now see this is coming as
10:09 - not an svg
10:18 - so i don't know about that let's see if
10:20 - we can drop that
10:27 - yeah
10:29 - i don't think that'll work
10:33 - let me see if everybody
10:35 - oh okay here we've got a um
10:39 - comp sci guy says
10:41 - is linked um
10:44 - let me get this link
10:46 - copy link address
10:48 - uh open what is it opengameart.org
10:52 - that seems like
10:54 - exactly what i need oh okay
10:56 - i think i've checked on here before a
10:59 - long time ago for a different game
11:03 - and let's see we what we can
11:07 - trying to see what kind of
11:10 - search we can do
11:13 - 2d
11:16 - yeah if you want 2d there we go
11:30 - my favorites
11:33 - okay
11:35 - this might take some more searching
11:37 - and figuring out how to use this but i
11:39 - actually really like this
11:44 - so
11:45 - i'm going to leave this up
11:48 - for now
11:50 - but i i feel like this is something i
11:51 - would want to look at more
11:53 - because it seems like it has a ton of
11:56 - options
11:58 - and this one
12:01 - doesn't look like it's going to give
12:04 - give us svgs
12:06 - which is what i really want
12:09 - basically the reason i really want to
12:10 - try to find an svg is that we can
12:12 - control the size and the color
12:15 - through code and we can animate as well
12:17 - right so
12:20 - um that's
12:22 - that would be like best case scenario
12:24 - okay so these are available in svg
12:27 - cool um
12:30 - all right these ones
12:39 - oh these ones actually have color let's
12:40 - just click these ones this one first
12:43 - and see
12:55 - eventually i do want to give
12:58 - the kids an option to pick their
13:01 - their character
13:03 - [Music]
13:05 - so we may want to bring in more than one
13:06 - of these but let's find somebody with a
13:08 - sword or something
13:11 - uh
13:12 - this person has this oh just they're
13:14 - like really specific it's not just hero
13:17 - character it's actually a spartan
13:19 - character
13:21 - all right there we go
13:23 - a knight with a sword alright let's see
13:25 - that wow and you can even get colored
13:27 - versions very nice all right now here's
13:29 - what i want to see
13:32 - oh is this not free we may have to buy
13:35 - these
13:36 - shoot
13:42 - hmm
13:46 - all right um
13:50 - here we go here's another one
13:51 - svgrepow.com
13:58 - uh comp scott guy says in the meantime
14:00 - you could just give them a border and
14:02 - border radius until we find appropriate
14:03 - svgs
14:06 - um
14:08 - yeah we could
14:10 - yeah i just want to try oops
14:12 - did i not copy that
14:18 - okay
14:21 - this will be the last one we try
14:23 - before we move on
14:28 - looking for like maybe a very like
14:30 - cartoon looking
14:40 - all right let's just grab this one
14:42 - just to see what we get
15:10 - all right so i need to find
15:18 - i want to open this with
15:21 - vs code
15:28 - so i can see what the code looks like
15:30 - where's my downloads
15:37 - there we go
15:39 - all right so let's open this with visual
15:42 - studio code
15:43 - there we are that's what i wanted to see
15:46 - okay
15:47 - so we have an svg
15:56 - all right so let's get rid of
15:58 - some of this stuff
16:02 - i don't want this
16:09 - all right
16:10 - and i'm gonna put this
16:13 - right in
16:15 - let's find our hero
16:21 - there we go
16:23 - so inside our view
16:27 - we already have our view for our hero
16:31 - i'm just going to paste this svg in
16:37 - all right let's see now this will not
16:39 - work for react native
16:42 - yes so and this this probably this might
16:44 - not even work for what we're doing right
16:45 - now
16:46 - um
16:50 - yes we may have to change some of this
16:52 - up just to even get it to to work at all
16:58 - expected corresponding closing tags
17:00 - review
17:02 - what is this
17:04 - i'm getting rid of all of these
17:10 - and
17:11 - let's see
17:13 - we should have
17:18 - there's our view
17:23 - here's our view right
17:42 - something's not getting closed properly
17:46 - what is this let's get rid of that
17:51 - i'm just going to start getting rid of
17:53 - stuff
17:55 - that
17:57 - is giving us
17:58 - problems
18:00 - all right let's see if that fixed yep
18:02 - that fixed it
18:04 - okay
18:06 - all right let's see what happens
18:08 - here i'm going to show
18:10 - okay john hanson dropped some links in
18:13 - here i'm showing them because uh if you
18:15 - put a link in the live chat it doesn't
18:16 - show up by default i have to choose to
18:18 - show them
18:20 - um
18:22 - let's see right click
18:24 - svg inside clean it make sure
18:31 - oh okay uh john has a link here where
18:34 - you could it seems like you can put an
18:36 - svg file in there and it'll clean it up
18:38 - so then you can put it into the site
18:40 - that's cool i usually just clean it up
18:42 - by hand but that seems like um it would
18:44 - be
18:45 - a lot easier just to do it on that site
18:48 - so i'll have to check it out
18:50 - um
18:51 - let's see
18:52 - all right make sure i save that let's
18:54 - see if if this is doing
18:56 - anything for us here
18:58 - it looks like no
19:00 - let's see what our air is
19:04 - style props okay so our styles are
19:08 - messing this up and
19:10 - that's just a warning though right
19:12 - yeah what's our actual error
19:16 - it's like the mapping from style
19:17 - properties
19:22 - okay
19:23 - so it looks like we need to get rid of
19:25 - those
19:28 - i was hoping it would still at least
19:30 - render but
19:31 - stuff
19:32 - phil
19:42 - um
19:46 - why does it say style fill we should
19:48 - just be able to say fill
19:51 - all right that's we're gonna
19:54 - we're gonna fix
19:56 - pretty much all of these right now
20:04 - okay
20:04 - um
20:08 - all right so first thing we'll do is
20:11 - change this to an equals
20:13 - and then
20:14 - add that
20:16 - we'll get rid of that
20:18 - and all of this okay
20:22 - so that should
20:24 - get rid of the air with fills
20:27 - and then
20:29 - let's try to do the same thing with this
20:32 - i'm not sure if it'll work but
20:35 - we'll see
20:39 - yeah let's just get rid of this
20:41 - okay
20:46 - yay okay
20:49 - it's not like uh
20:56 - we we definitely took out some stuff i
20:58 - think that was needed
21:00 - because this does not look like we
21:02 - brought in but
21:04 - we've got something there
21:08 - okay
21:13 - oh nice so john also has a link for a
21:16 - tool to convert
21:17 - uh svgs into jsx um so into stuff that
21:22 - react can use so that's that's awesome
21:26 - okay
21:27 - um comp side guys said maybe turn those
21:29 - styles into objects um
21:32 - i thought about doing that but then i
21:33 - realized that phil is actually a valid
21:36 - attribute for uh paths
21:38 - so that's why i just ended up taking
21:40 - that off
21:41 - um although this one that i just took
21:43 - off here
21:46 - i don't know what that did but
21:49 - it may have been important
21:51 - okay
21:54 - so we have an svg in there
22:00 - uh
22:06 - i think we need to make these bigger i
22:10 - know we made them smaller last time but
22:12 - this is kind of like ridiculously too
22:13 - small
22:16 - i think they need to be just a little
22:18 - bigger
22:24 - and let's see
22:29 - we should probably decide on
22:32 - what
22:33 - color scheme we really want
22:40 - let's just let's do this let's see if we
22:41 - can find some colors like this um
22:45 - colors for
22:48 - children
22:52 - let's see this all right i'm looking at
22:55 - a color palette for kids color palette
22:59 - seven cool colors for kids rooms
23:04 - there we go
23:11 - actually that's kind of cool
23:15 - as long as they can give me hex colors
23:18 - what no i don't
23:22 - all right i don't know what that was
23:28 - oh was this on pinch i didn't realize it
23:30 - was on pinterest okay
23:33 - all right forget that one i like those
23:35 - colors but that's not going to be uh
23:38 - didn't realize i was clicking on
23:40 - pinterest so much
23:46 - you would think when i typed in hex
23:48 - colors it would give me links that
23:50 - actually have x
23:52 - must include okay now i see it says
23:54 - missing hex
23:57 - all right let's say
24:00 - children's
24:05 - website
24:09 - web colors
24:13 - see
24:26 - all right
24:30 - no i wow this is actually really cool
24:32 - though
24:34 - it's like
24:35 - a lift the flap book
24:37 - for all the colors
24:39 - so it's for kids
24:41 - all right
24:43 - i really like that book but that's
24:45 - beside the point
24:51 - all right so let's see you use a chrome
24:53 - extension that gives you colors all
24:55 - right i'm getting a lot of of links for
24:57 - color stuff
24:58 - all right
25:02 - let me just try out one of these i'm
25:04 - just gonna try the last one i got
25:16 - so this is going to generate colors
25:19 - uh
25:19 - okay let's figure this out hit the space
25:22 - bar to generate color schemes click on a
25:24 - color
25:27 - okay
25:28 - cool
25:33 - that's all all right
25:36 - all right this looks cool so let's
25:38 - spacebar
25:39 - get some colors
25:50 - let's just wait till we find one that
25:52 - looks like it's good for kids this is
25:53 - nice and bright all right let's let's
25:55 - pick this one
25:57 - all right so let's just go with this
26:06 - and
26:13 - what do y'all think
26:15 - oh wow i have a lot more links too
26:17 - i'll have to check all these out
26:19 - uh at some point but all right ready
26:22 - what do you think about this color
26:24 - palette
26:25 - i'll give everybody like 10 seconds to
26:27 - put in their opinions on this color
26:29 - palette
26:31 - i have about two minutes left a little
26:33 - over two minutes and then i'm gonna go
26:34 - to the chat and answer some questions so
26:36 - if you have any questions you put them
26:37 - in now
26:40 - all right let's
26:44 - cool it looks cool alright awesome
26:48 - oh okay wow you can do alternative
26:51 - shades you can do lots of cool stuff
26:53 - let's see about this exporting
26:57 - export palette
27:01 - scss wow interesting
27:06 - let's see what this looks like
27:08 - we can get an scss file
27:13 - yeah that's that might not be a bad idea
27:19 - i want to open this with code as well
27:24 - we can find it there it is
27:26 - okay
27:28 - opening code cool now we can just copy
27:31 - and paste these colors
27:37 - um we could probably put these in like
27:39 - an actual theme file if we wanted to
27:42 - and i believe we do have a theme
27:45 - so we created a color theme
27:49 - like down here
27:50 - and this is basically just like our
27:52 - background colors
27:54 - um
27:57 - but we could build out our theme a bit
27:59 - more and we already have it here right
28:01 - so
28:04 - we could say
28:05 - hero
28:09 - oops background color
28:10 - oh how did we do this
28:13 - edition background color
28:18 - trying to remember how i put this in
28:20 - here
28:22 - i might not have done it in a way that
28:23 - will work for what i wanted to do
28:30 - let's see
28:36 - oh okay i did do it the right way i
28:38 - thought
28:39 - since i actually used background color i
28:41 - thought for a second
28:43 - i was like locked into actually using
28:46 - css but
28:48 - all right let's say
28:50 - hero color
28:56 - and let's split this
28:59 - so i can just grab them
29:08 - all right let's give
29:17 - hero color
29:18 - did my oh my timer went off
29:23 - okay
29:24 - when we get back from uh answering some
29:26 - questions we'll just finish filling this
29:28 - out a little bit
29:29 - and then add in our colors and then that
29:31 - way we'll have
29:33 - a pretty easy mechanism for changing all
29:36 - the colors at once
29:38 - and
29:39 - at some point we could potentially give
29:40 - the user the ability to
29:44 - change the theme change the colors i
29:46 - think that would be kind of cool
29:48 - um
29:50 - based like me just observing my own kids
29:52 - they will spend so much time like
29:54 - customizing
29:56 - the colors and stuff
29:58 - um
30:01 - that might be cool for them
30:03 - like i know right now we have it
30:05 - like addition subtraction multiplication
30:07 - but maybe actually giving the user the
30:09 - ability to further customize
30:13 - the colors would
30:14 - would probably be a cool feature
30:18 - all right so let's start my timer
30:28 - over here
30:30 - all right so we'll do a short break
30:32 - and i'm going to scroll up and try to
30:35 - answer as many questions as i can
30:46 - um
30:50 - or alicia says uh make a code that
30:53 - stores students marks please using c
30:55 - plus
30:56 - um
30:58 - i don't really do c plus plus so
31:01 - i mean we could do code like that but
31:06 - um
31:08 - it would be like with javascript and not
31:10 - c plus
31:18 - benjamin says i love free code camp
31:20 - awesome
31:25 - uh comp sci guys so i was talking about
31:29 - building this for um
31:32 - like ios or android comp sci guy says we
31:34 - could just use react native init
31:37 - yeah we actually could maybe i'll try to
31:39 - do that
31:40 - um that might be good to try to do
31:43 - during a stream actually
31:45 - i expect them
31:47 - to run into issues
31:49 - because i just always do
31:51 - so uh that would be a good one for a
31:53 - stream so maybe we'll try to do that on
31:55 - the next stream i'd really love to have
31:58 - that available before i
32:00 - before next week because i want to demo
32:02 - it um
32:03 - at the conference
32:13 - sagemo jesse says uh their name is jesse
32:16 - too awesome
32:24 - i mentioned earlier that i thought i was
32:25 - getting sick imagine it sounds like you
32:27 - got the man flu been there before
32:32 - yeah unfortunately i have too much stuff
32:33 - to do and i can't just lay around
32:36 - which is what i would normally prefer to
32:38 - do when i'm sick
32:42 - um zach says these streams are great by
32:44 - the way thank you i appreciate that
32:47 - uh zach also asked if i work in pomodoro
32:50 - technique so the 25 minute code 5-minute
32:52 - break i try to it's a little bit more
32:55 - difficult with my
32:58 - my new so my old job
33:00 - i was working on things mostly solo and
33:03 - i had like
33:04 - stuck to the pomodoro technique almost
33:06 - all the time with my new job i do a lot
33:09 - more pair programming
33:11 - and i'm in like an open office setting
33:13 - so
33:14 - it's harder to stick to that like the
33:18 - i i'm way more likely to just get
33:19 - interrupted in the middle of it or um
33:23 - like if i'm pair programming
33:26 - then it's hard to say like
33:29 - i would have to convince the other
33:30 - person i'm pairing with that like this
33:32 - is how we're gonna do it
33:34 - so i haven't found a great way to
33:35 - consistently use it but i'd really like
33:38 - to start using it again
33:43 - sorry
33:46 - all right
33:48 - sage mode says beginner here need to
33:50 - download python but it's kind of tricky
33:52 - don't think i'm doing it right also i
33:54 - heard you don't have to download
33:56 - javascript that's true yeah you
33:58 - javascript just runs on the browser uh
34:00 - you don't need to download it
34:02 - um
34:05 - i don't
34:06 - even remember how to download python
34:10 - like if i've done it it's been so long
34:12 - ago
34:13 - and i'm not sure there are some like in
34:15 - browser editors that will let you run
34:17 - python so you may want to check that out
34:20 - it might just let you get started faster
34:22 - with python without having to mess with
34:24 - the download
34:29 - benjamin says all the videos jesse
34:31 - records should be in a playlist right
34:33 - yep it is in playwrist so
34:35 - there is a huge playlist of all the live
34:37 - streams and that's just called live
34:39 - coding with jesse and then there are
34:41 - other playlists broken down by project
34:44 - so this particular project which we're
34:46 - on
34:48 - day 13
34:50 - um
34:51 - has its own playlist with just like
34:53 - these 13 videos
34:58 - a couple you're asking how i am so i
35:01 - already addressed that earlier so i'm
35:02 - not gonna repeat it but
35:04 - uh you can
35:06 - basically i'm good so but you can check
35:08 - out the longer answer uh
35:10 - on the replay
35:19 - all right somebody who i can't pronounce
35:21 - their name it's in different characters
35:24 - keeps asking if i am dj smash i am not
35:27 - dj smash
35:28 - uh and once we do google dj smash so
35:31 - maybe i'll google that after the stream
35:37 - let's see
35:48 - um
35:49 - riyad says i am i'm not able to
35:51 - understand your english
35:55 - i'm sorry about that
35:56 - um
35:59 - yeah i'm not sure i'll try to speak as
36:01 - clearly as i can
36:03 - um but
36:05 - i'm not sure what else i could do about
36:07 - that
36:08 - i'd love to get subtitles for these at
36:09 - some point if anybody's interested in
36:11 - doing subtitles
36:13 - you know please let me know
36:16 - sy a myth says that they unsubscribed
36:19 - i'm sorry to hear that uh if you want to
36:21 - let me know why you unsubscribed i could
36:24 - try to do a better job then um
36:28 - although they not sure they're still
36:30 - stuck around if they already unsubscribe
36:32 - uh all right let me
36:35 - my timer went off so
36:37 - let's make a note of where i stopped at
36:40 - 7
36:41 - 40.
36:44 - let's see
36:54 - 751 in my chat okay
36:58 - all right let's see what's what's this
37:00 - time 809
37:02 - okay
37:04 - i'm not gonna start another pomodoro
37:05 - timer
37:09 - we're just going to do a little bit more
37:10 - and then i'm going to finish up
37:13 - because if i do a whole nother pomodoro
37:14 - session i'm not going to have time to
37:16 - get through all the questions
37:18 - okay so let me get rid of that
37:22 - yeah don't say that
37:24 - let's just bring over these colors a bit
37:26 - and see if we can get our more
37:28 - reasonable color scheme
37:32 - okay oh background color let's change
37:35 - our background color
37:36 - uh
37:43 - do we want to go with the white
37:45 - background
37:47 - you want to go the colored background
37:49 - just let me know if you if you have an
37:51 - opinion on that
37:54 - i really love dark themes i'm like so
37:56 - tempted to just put this dark color as
37:58 - the background
38:00 - maybe i'll just try it
38:03 - we'll try it out
38:04 - see what happens
38:06 - all right
38:07 - hero color let's go with enemy
38:13 - enemy color
38:15 - and we'll give that the
38:18 - reddish color
38:21 - for now
38:25 - and
38:27 - oh let's do our button background as
38:29 - this yellow
38:33 - that seems cool
38:38 - i think the yellow actually looked
38:40 - really cool on the
38:42 - dark background
38:50 - button color
38:52 - [Music]
38:54 - okay
38:56 - i'm not sure what we'll do with the
38:57 - green let me see if we can figure out
38:59 - where that'll where that could go we
39:01 - don't have to use all the colors but
39:10 - yeah we're gonna have to change the
39:12 - color of the text as well
39:16 - so let's just put that in there for now
39:25 - text color
39:26 - let's just make this white for now oops
39:32 - okay
39:34 - that's pretty cool
39:35 - whoops
39:37 - uh comp sci guy mentioned i had an extra
39:40 - semicolon there thank you so much for
39:45 - uh for
39:46 - catching that
39:48 - all right so
39:50 - let's shrink this side up a bit we don't
39:52 - really need it
39:53 - and let's just try to add in these
39:56 - colors and see what it looks like
39:59 - so
40:00 - we need
40:08 - the font is gonna be the hardest thing
40:10 - the font color
40:15 - all right so we need to add
40:20 - uh
40:21 - let's see
40:23 - we need to add an array so we need to
40:25 - make our styles an array
40:28 - so for right now i'm just going to
40:29 - override whatever we have with our
40:33 - styles here so this will be
40:35 - fonts
40:38 - and
40:40 - this is we'll say
40:43 - there we go active
40:45 - theme
40:46 - dot
40:47 - text color
40:52 - and
40:55 - zeros okay and our hero
41:00 - wow so we have styles heroes
41:03 - styles character let's see um
41:09 - will this even matter
41:12 - yeah we have that svg there uh actually
41:15 - i think the background is still showing
41:17 - up so we still have some purple around
41:18 - the outside
41:21 - so let's do this and say
41:24 - background color
41:26 - and
41:30 - active theme
41:33 - the
41:34 - hero
41:35 - color
41:38 - what did i do oops
41:49 - there we go
41:52 - okay
41:56 - so um
41:57 - what we're doing here right is we're
41:59 - bringing in all the styles that we have
42:01 - in our style sheet at the bottom
42:03 - of character and of hero and then we're
42:06 - pulling in background colors so it'll
42:08 - it will cascade and like whatever comes
42:11 - last will override whatever was before
42:14 - it okay so we're already setting
42:17 - the background color
42:19 - for our hero
42:21 - um i believe here but it should be
42:24 - overridden by our background color here
42:27 - at least that's what i think is gonna
42:28 - happen
42:33 - all right now we have our enemies
42:35 - and
42:40 - we can do the same
42:42 - very a similar thing with our enemies
42:45 - background color
42:48 - active themed
42:51 - enemy color
42:53 - there we go
42:55 - we have more text here so we want to do
43:00 - style
43:02 - books
43:03 - equals
43:08 - font color
43:12 - active theme dot text oops
43:16 - text color
43:19 - and
43:20 - oh is our button so our button color is
43:23 - now going to be
43:27 - active theme dot button color
43:33 - and
43:34 - i think we have another button
43:36 - down here
43:38 - so let's
43:45 - oops yeah we're not going to be able to
43:47 - copy that because this one's a touchable
43:49 - opacity
43:50 - so let's make an object here
44:00 - and this will be
44:04 - background color
44:09 - button color
44:11 - nope
44:12 - not how it's supposed to go active theme
44:17 - dot button color
44:20 - and this needs to be in
44:24 - oops
44:26 - this needs to be an object
44:30 - there we go
44:34 - usually a good sign that you've messed
44:36 - up the syntax is when you're not getting
44:38 - your um autocomplete showing up
44:44 - uh okay
44:45 - we do have some more text
44:48 - that needs to be changed to the text
44:50 - color
44:51 - so
44:53 - fortunately these all have the same
44:57 - type of thing going on here so
45:00 - we're gonna use our multiple cursors so
45:02 - for the way my keyboard's set up which i
45:05 - don't know if this is the default for vs
45:06 - code or not i just press ctrl or command
45:09 - d
45:10 - and i can do this and get the multiple
45:12 - cursors right so
45:14 - uh we need to make this an object
45:19 - and then
45:21 - we'll make
45:23 - i'm sorry we need to make it an array
45:25 - first and then add in a style object
45:29 - um
45:33 - what was it
45:36 - font color that's it
45:39 - font color
45:41 - and that's going to be active
45:44 - theme
45:46 - dot
45:49 - text
45:52 - color
45:54 - verify that change for all of them
45:56 - yep
46:00 - all right cool
46:01 - i mean there's got to be a better way to
46:03 - do this at 2 because we're starting to
46:05 - get
46:06 - a lot of stuff happening in here so
46:10 - we'll try to find a better way to do it
46:12 - all right so let's save that and see if
46:15 - it worked
46:17 - oh okay it worked
46:21 - cool
46:22 - i'm not sure that that actually looks
46:23 - better oh you know it didn't work though
46:26 - this um
46:30 - this font color
46:38 - because it's not font color it's color
46:41 - i really did somebody catch that
46:45 - it's just color
46:48 - i don't know what i was thinking
46:50 - that's like basic css right there
46:52 - all right so let's find everywhere where
46:55 - we have font color
46:57 - and change it to
46:59 - color
47:05 - okay
47:11 - there we are okay
47:14 - and this might be
47:15 - uh we need to change it inside there but
47:17 - i don't know if i
47:19 - want to change it because
47:22 - i don't think that looks that good let
47:24 - me know what you think
47:30 - maybe it's just my screen i don't know
47:32 - but this does not look good to me
47:35 - where's our where's our code here
47:38 - it just this looks like it would look
47:40 - better on this screen but then when we
47:42 - actually did it here
47:44 - not not great
47:47 - yeah all right so it's saying colors are
47:50 - drab yeah it does look kind of drab
47:53 - all right well the good thing is this
47:56 - we now have an easy way to change all
48:00 - the colors
48:02 - in our
48:05 - in our app
48:06 - so
48:07 - now if we want to mess with new colors
48:09 - all we have to do is just change these
48:12 - not only that but we already set it up
48:15 - so that we could easily
48:17 - like change themes so what we could do
48:19 - is just have
48:21 - like four different themes or more if we
48:24 - really wanted to but for right now we're
48:25 - set up for four
48:27 - and
48:29 - just flip back and forth and really see
48:31 - which which ones we like better
48:34 - um see them side by side we can even
48:36 - open up a bunch like more than one
48:38 - window at a time side-by-side compare
48:41 - themes so
48:42 - uh although we didn't
48:44 - find a theme we really liked we did set
48:47 - it up so that it'll be easier to find
48:48 - that theme so
48:50 - i'm okay with that we also
48:54 - um
48:55 - tried an svg
48:57 - so probably not gonna use this svg but
49:00 - at least
49:02 - we have the silhouette of a human-like
49:05 - form
49:09 - so
49:11 - let me um
49:13 - let me go ahead and commit this
49:15 - so you all can check out the code and
49:18 - play what if you want if you want to
49:19 - like
49:20 - mess with themes and stuff and if you
49:21 - find a cool one and want to do a pull
49:23 - request
49:24 - by all means please do that
49:28 - um
49:29 - but as soon as i
49:32 - commit this and push it to the git repo
49:34 - i'm gonna go through some questions and
49:35 - then uh finish up for today
49:38 - and go to my other job
49:41 - this is not really a job this is just a
49:42 - volunteer for fun type of thing so
49:45 - the job i get paid for i'll go to that
49:48 - next all right so let's do a git status
49:52 - oops
49:54 - let's make this bigger
49:56 - yep so we modified app.js
49:59 - git commits i'm going to say
50:02 - we're going to add do the add together
50:04 - with the commit and we're going to put
50:05 - the commit message in and let's just say
50:08 - um
50:17 - scg
50:18 - for hero
50:22 - and new theme
50:27 - and i'll do a git push
50:30 - all right all that code should be there
50:32 - um now
50:34 - i can also do a deploy
50:37 - so that the new code will be in
50:41 - that gh pages but i don't think i'm
50:43 - going to do it yet
50:44 - because
50:45 - i think the theme is actually
50:48 - uglier than the one that's currently out
50:50 - there so
50:53 - so i'm just gonna wait before i i push
50:56 - that to that
50:57 - uh demo link
51:00 - all right let's go to the chat
51:05 - and i believe we left off yeah 751
51:14 - okay
51:35 - um
51:36 - all right there's a lot of discussion
51:38 - about when we were bringing that svg
51:40 - over so i'm gonna skip some of this
51:42 - because we already went over some of it
51:44 - um
51:49 - let's see
51:54 - all right so see there's a lot of cool
51:55 - links i'm gonna have to go through all
51:57 - those links that you all shared and
51:58 - check them out uh later on

52:40 - consider myself to be good at python
52:45 - hanzo says make a tutorial in javascript
52:48 - um i do have some tutorial
52:52 - videos in on my channel i don't know if
52:55 - i actually have a javascript one a lot
52:56 - of it is more like getting all your dev
52:58 - environments set up using git and things
53:01 - like that
53:04 - void roamer says good morning what's
53:06 - going on where's the music stream uh the
53:08 - music stream should still be going
53:10 - so if you're looking for the music
53:12 - stream um just like get out of my stream
53:15 - and then
53:18 - i think the music stream is usually uh
53:22 - like always going like 24 7 so
53:26 - you may have to like search for it but
53:29 - it should be ups though
53:33 - um t says i don't want to interview for
53:36 - a dev job too early and lose a good
53:37 - opportunity with that company because
53:39 - i'm not ready when do i know i'm ready
53:41 - to start applying for web developer jobs
53:44 - um
53:46 - honestly i i think you're ready when you
53:49 - can convince somebody else that you're
53:51 - ready to to actually have a job right
53:54 - like that's
53:55 - that's all that really matters like if
53:56 - you can convince your interviewer that
54:00 - you can do the work
54:02 - then you'll get the job
54:05 - right so
54:07 - i mean to to convince yourself
54:11 - maybe you could do some practice
54:12 - interviews and see how you do
54:15 - um
54:16 - check out so on my youtube channel i do
54:20 - have some videos on
54:21 - interviewing and on my interview
54:23 - experience
54:24 - and i talk a lot more about
54:26 - um preparing for interviews
54:29 - so
54:30 - there's some good resources on there she
54:31 - might want to check that out
54:33 - i believe there's a link to my channel
54:35 - in the description of this video
54:39 - um
54:42 - lewis says are you from the netherlands
54:44 - i am not from the netherlands i'm from
54:47 - um from the u.s
54:52 - um benjamin asks why it's named p7d13
54:56 - uh so it's uh project seven day 13. uh
54:59 - it looks like that already got answered
55:01 - in the chat so thank you
55:04 - t says you do kind of look like dj smash
55:06 - but not really all right i definitely
55:08 - have to look up this dj smash person
55:10 - after the stream
55:13 - ernesto says hey i like your videos uh
55:17 - thank you i appreciate that thanks for
55:19 - watching
55:20 - red light bd says i love your tutorial
55:23 - thank you
55:25 - benjamin says keep up the excellent work
55:27 - mate
55:27 - thanks man everybody's being so nice in
55:30 - this stream uh i actually thought i
55:32 - didn't do a great job because
55:35 - we
55:35 - i couldn't make anything look nice but
55:38 - uh i i really appreciate all the the
55:41 - positive uh encouragement there
55:45 - at
55:46 - yeah says i'm just starting to learn
55:48 - some back end development what
55:49 - technology do you do do you think i
55:51 - should be learning at this stage
55:53 - um it really depends like
55:57 - it depends on what you're using so
56:00 - like if you're using node for back end
56:02 - then you definitely want to be familiar
56:04 - with like node package manager
56:06 - like that whole ecosystem uh probably
56:09 - express
56:10 - um
56:12 - i mean of course like no matter what
56:14 - you're doing you want to learn about
56:15 - version control so most likely get
56:18 - um
56:19 - how to how to do stuff with with get um
56:24 - i don't know arguably if it's just you
56:26 - learning then you might want to learn a
56:27 - little bit about like actual deployment
56:29 - um and how to manage manage that manage
56:32 - like servers and stuff
56:34 - maybe some database stuff
56:37 - so
56:38 - it does kind of depend exactly on what
56:39 - you're working on but in general i think
56:42 - those things are
56:43 - pretty good to know at least a little
56:45 - bit about
56:47 - uh md
56:49 - uh is islam
56:51 - says i love your tutorial the wave
56:52 - explanation is nice oh thanks
56:55 - i'm glad you like it
56:59 - uh dead zombie says how do you import
57:02 - scss styles and react i see you always
57:05 - make separate styles object for your
57:07 - components but can i just have a
57:08 - separate sas file for my components
57:11 - um yes you can have a sas file
57:15 - but you got to be careful so like
57:17 - for the web that will work
57:19 - but if you're trying to run
57:22 - run this on mobile so like we're using
57:24 - react native
57:25 - and you can have a separate file
57:28 - for your css or scss
57:31 - scss yeah i said that right
57:36 - but
57:37 - you'll have to make sure that you're
57:39 - only pulling those in for web and you
57:41 - use the object
57:44 - version of css
57:46 - for
57:48 - mobile
57:50 - hopefully that makes sense
57:53 - maybe once we actually do start running
57:55 - mobile at the same time it'll make more
57:57 - sense
57:59 - um but if you're just doing like plane
58:01 - react and you're only going to build a
58:03 - web then yeah you can definitely use
58:05 - scss you just have to make sure your
58:06 - build pack like your your webpack config
58:09 - can handle that
58:11 - so depending on what you're using it
58:13 - might be already available to you to
58:16 - just write sas and it'll work
58:18 - or you may have to set that up on your
58:20 - own
58:21 - with webpack
58:28 - ernesto says soon i'm going to
58:29 - university to study software engineering
58:31 - any tips
58:33 - my only advice would be
58:37 - make sure you keep working on your own
58:38 - side projects and keep learning on your
58:40 - own with the latest stuff is
58:43 - in university just the way that
58:45 - that things work like
58:47 - it's hard for your professors to be on
58:49 - the cutting edge
58:51 - and teach you the latest stuff
58:52 - right because like they prepare all
58:54 - their stuff for class
58:56 - in advance
58:57 - so by the time they're actually teaching
58:59 - it it might be outdated
59:02 - so
59:03 - you'll learn a lot of the fundamentals
59:04 - of computer science
59:06 - but
59:07 - you may not learn what the latest tools
59:09 - and techniques are so just try to keep
59:12 - that up on your own
59:18 - comp side guy says i would make the
59:20 - background color that green color again
59:22 - okay
59:23 - so it's too dark
59:25 - yeah maybe maybe dark theme
59:28 - is not the right way to go
59:30 - for uh
59:31 - for the kids kidzap
59:52 - uh bartek says did anyone have such a
59:55 - problem with the github collaborators
59:57 - that they could not make any commits
60:02 - i'm not sure
60:04 - uh i haven't had any issues with that so
60:06 - i'm not sure what exactly issues you're
60:08 - facing maybe if you could explain a
60:10 - little bit more
60:11 - i could be more helpful to you
60:15 - um fanduel says what language do you do
60:18 - for your job um react native mostly and
60:21 - also um dotnet
60:24 - so it's like
60:25 - csharp.net core
60:34 - comp side guy says jesse i think your
60:36 - stream is awesome i like how you show
60:38 - true development it involves a bunch of
60:39 - trial and error and developers aren't
60:41 - super humans and we make mistakes
60:44 - yeah for sure i definitely make a lot of
60:46 - mistakes
60:47 - it says i'm working on a production
60:49 - production reactor a little bit of react
60:50 - native and we make mistakes all the time
60:52 - but we keep working till we get a solid
60:54 - product thanks i appreciate you saying
60:56 - that and yeah that's like
60:58 - kind of the whole idea behind the stream
61:00 - is just
61:02 - like this isn't going to be a perfect
61:03 - tutorial like this is just going to be
61:06 - working through things and i don't know
61:08 - how i'm gonna solve problems when i
61:10 - start the stream like we we figure it
61:12 - out together um yeah and we do make a
61:14 - lot of mistakes which is exactly how it
61:17 - goes for me at my real job as well
61:21 - um catalin says how do you make holy
61:24 - water
61:26 - um
61:29 - oh and it's the joke it's a joke okay
61:32 - how do you make holy water and the punch
61:34 - line is you boil the hell out of it
61:37 - i that's
61:41 - i thought you were serious for a second
61:42 - i was going to be like um
61:45 - i guess you need to find a priest
61:49 - but it was a joke um
61:53 - comp sci guy says does react native web
61:56 - ignore the gradle ios uh android files
61:59 - for the yarn start yes
62:02 - yes so actually we we built this with
62:04 - create react app
62:06 - and so it just runs
62:09 - the normal
62:10 - create react app
62:12 - start so it's gonna run like react
62:14 - script start
62:17 - yeah and then all those other normal
62:18 - files for like ios and android
62:21 - those only get
62:24 - get used when we um when we build for
62:28 - mobile
62:29 - okay all right i've gotten to the end of
62:31 - the chat thank you all so much for
62:33 - watching
62:34 - um
62:35 - i'm going to try to
62:37 - do another stream on
62:39 - friday i'd love to get another one in
62:41 - before next week because next week
62:43 - i'll be gone so i probably won't be able
62:46 - to stream
62:48 - maybe friday of next week so
62:51 - uh so keep a lookout on social media
62:53 - twitter on your notifications or
62:55 - whatever um
62:57 - on friday morning and hopefully i'll get
62:59 - another stream and then
63:01 - but until then i hope you have a great
63:03 - great couple of days and remember if
63:06 - anybody's in minnesota and wants to hang
63:09 - out let me know i'll be there next week
63:11 - and
63:13 - yeah thanks again everybody have a great
63:15 - day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to keep doing some styling as you can see we've got a lot of work to do so not exactly the best ui sorry i was a few minutes late i uh didn't realize how much setup i would need i didn't realize my computer had turned off and things had updated so it just took me a few extra minutes um so let me give you a quick update um you may hear my kids in the background they're about to leave for school so let me give you a quick update before we start with the coding uh just on what's going on so i was recently at the star trek conference so that's in columbus uh it's a tech conference um so i unexpectedly gave a talk on react native web and i used this project as an example i'm gonna give um the same talk next week at ndc minnesota so if i know anybody in minnesota and you want to meet up i'll be there most of next week so let me know and uh one thing i i realized is when i'm using this project to display like to demonstrate what's going on we haven't built for um for mobile yet so i can't demonstrate that now there is there is an issue with that so i really want to use expo but currently expo does not support um the context is it the context api or hooks one of those two i can't remember but basically we're doing stuff right now that is not supported by expo so we have to wait until that support comes out so um we could possibly just build um for react native like build for mobile with just regular react native and not worry about expo i've done that before like that's a possibility so we may do that just wanted to give you an update on where i'm at was coming up and uh what the plans are for this project but no matter what today we're gonna work on styling okay uh let me say hi to everyone and see what's up in the chat before we get started chas white cases why the long face uh no reason i just put they were talking about this picture i put on the thumbnail where i i don't really look that happy i just looked through my photos and picked one that i hadn't used yet and that was the first one i found so um i think i took that last week so that's not not feeling sad today um everybody's saying hello good morning uh benjamin asks how i'm doing uh actually not too bad not too bad i'm uh i think i might be coming down with something i woke up with a sore throat and a stuffy nose but hopefully it's nothing too bad since i gotta travel next week all right okay let me let me get started and anybody that's asking questions in the chat i'll get back to your questions very soon so i'm gonna set this timer and um when this timer goes off i'm gonna go back to the live chat and answer uh as many questions as i can all right so let's see let's get rid of that it's not running um first off let me i'm gonna go to the contributors page just to uh give a shout out to everybody that's contributed so far uh so i like to put this up here you know occasionally just to let everybody know uh you know who's been contributing so thank you to everyone who's contributed so far definitely um welcome any uh any pull requests you may have all right let's let's go to the code first things first always start your day off with a get pool oh looks like oh okay so i did update uh the gh pages so that's the the link in so if we go to the project and click on this link you can actually check out the project here so i'm going to put that link in the description so you just check it out you know right now but that's updated so i i didn't realize that it was still running an older version uh so i updated that over the weekend and it's back to our code okay also usually just run yarn as well or an npm install now i i know that there were no packages pulled down but just in case sometimes i forget maybe i installed a package on another computer like that way we're all set i've already started the development server and so we're good to go so right now a lot of our stuff basically our entire app for the most part is split between this app producer.js and app.js so in terms of our styles we can see most of our styles are here in app.js all right and i apologize in advance i'm gonna yawn a lot i didn't have any caffeine yet so uh it's gonna happen i'm sorry uh so yeah here's our styles right we have it in the form of javascript objects we're using the stylesheet.create that comes with react native okay so let's figure out exactly what we're gonna do what we're gonna try to get done in this stream uh so the last stream we did some work with the submit button basically we made this bigger let me go let's shrink this down to what size the hundred percent size um so that we get a good idea um when you shrink it down to this size it does seem like the proportions are a bit off right but uh what i'd really like to do is make these boxes look different right it's not obvious what these even are right now okay so ideally what i would love to find is an svg an open source svg and it has a little icon that looks like a hero right and enemies so that's what i love to put in here not sure if we're going to find that but let's just do a quick search if we don't find anything in the first like minute or two then we'll just move on to something else but hopefully we can find something suitable for this uh also it might be kind of cool to have different backgrounds show up like i'm thinking depending on what's going on maybe we have different backgrounds so uh instead of just a message that shows up it could be remember this is a kids game right so we want to try to be visual and not rely on textbased things as much so potentially like images or graphics would show up for victory for defeat um getting a question right getting it wrong okay so let's check out um free svg character icons i don't know trying to think of the best way to do this oh that might work all right let's just check out a few of these all right that's that's not bad let's visit that whoa okay all right not bad let's see how this how we would actually go about loading this uh trying to find one i like i guess it doesn't matter let's just pick whatever because i want to see and now see this is coming as not an svg so i don't know about that let's see if we can drop that yeah i don't think that'll work let me see if everybody oh okay here we've got a um comp sci guy says is linked um let me get this link copy link address uh open what is it opengameart.org that seems like exactly what i need oh okay i think i've checked on here before a long time ago for a different game and let's see we what we can trying to see what kind of search we can do 2d yeah if you want 2d there we go my favorites okay this might take some more searching and figuring out how to use this but i actually really like this so i'm going to leave this up for now but i i feel like this is something i would want to look at more because it seems like it has a ton of options and this one doesn't look like it's going to give give us svgs which is what i really want basically the reason i really want to try to find an svg is that we can control the size and the color through code and we can animate as well right so um that's that would be like best case scenario okay so these are available in svg cool um all right these ones oh these ones actually have color let's just click these ones this one first and see eventually i do want to give the kids an option to pick their their character so we may want to bring in more than one of these but let's find somebody with a sword or something uh this person has this oh just they're like really specific it's not just hero character it's actually a spartan character all right there we go a knight with a sword alright let's see that wow and you can even get colored versions very nice all right now here's what i want to see oh is this not free we may have to buy these shoot hmm all right um here we go here's another one svgrepow.com uh comp scott guy says in the meantime you could just give them a border and border radius until we find appropriate svgs um yeah we could yeah i just want to try oops did i not copy that okay this will be the last one we try before we move on looking for like maybe a very like cartoon looking all right let's just grab this one just to see what we get all right so i need to find i want to open this with vs code so i can see what the code looks like where's my downloads there we go all right so let's open this with visual studio code there we are that's what i wanted to see okay so we have an svg all right so let's get rid of some of this stuff i don't want this all right and i'm gonna put this right in let's find our hero there we go so inside our view we already have our view for our hero i'm just going to paste this svg in all right let's see now this will not work for react native yes so and this this probably this might not even work for what we're doing right now um yes we may have to change some of this up just to even get it to to work at all expected corresponding closing tags review what is this i'm getting rid of all of these and let's see we should have there's our view here's our view right something's not getting closed properly what is this let's get rid of that i'm just going to start getting rid of stuff that is giving us problems all right let's see if that fixed yep that fixed it okay all right let's see what happens here i'm going to show okay john hanson dropped some links in here i'm showing them because uh if you put a link in the live chat it doesn't show up by default i have to choose to show them um let's see right click svg inside clean it make sure oh okay uh john has a link here where you could it seems like you can put an svg file in there and it'll clean it up so then you can put it into the site that's cool i usually just clean it up by hand but that seems like um it would be a lot easier just to do it on that site so i'll have to check it out um let's see all right make sure i save that let's see if if this is doing anything for us here it looks like no let's see what our air is style props okay so our styles are messing this up and that's just a warning though right yeah what's our actual error it's like the mapping from style properties okay so it looks like we need to get rid of those i was hoping it would still at least render but stuff phil um why does it say style fill we should just be able to say fill all right that's we're gonna we're gonna fix pretty much all of these right now okay um all right so first thing we'll do is change this to an equals and then add that we'll get rid of that and all of this okay so that should get rid of the air with fills and then let's try to do the same thing with this i'm not sure if it'll work but we'll see yeah let's just get rid of this okay yay okay it's not like uh we we definitely took out some stuff i think that was needed because this does not look like we brought in but we've got something there okay oh nice so john also has a link for a tool to convert uh svgs into jsx um so into stuff that react can use so that's that's awesome okay um comp side guys said maybe turn those styles into objects um i thought about doing that but then i realized that phil is actually a valid attribute for uh paths so that's why i just ended up taking that off um although this one that i just took off here i don't know what that did but it may have been important okay so we have an svg in there uh i think we need to make these bigger i know we made them smaller last time but this is kind of like ridiculously too small i think they need to be just a little bigger and let's see we should probably decide on what color scheme we really want let's just let's do this let's see if we can find some colors like this um colors for children let's see this all right i'm looking at a color palette for kids color palette seven cool colors for kids rooms there we go actually that's kind of cool as long as they can give me hex colors what no i don't all right i don't know what that was oh was this on pinch i didn't realize it was on pinterest okay all right forget that one i like those colors but that's not going to be uh didn't realize i was clicking on pinterest so much you would think when i typed in hex colors it would give me links that actually have x must include okay now i see it says missing hex all right let's say children's website web colors see all right no i wow this is actually really cool though it's like a lift the flap book for all the colors so it's for kids all right i really like that book but that's beside the point all right so let's see you use a chrome extension that gives you colors all right i'm getting a lot of of links for color stuff all right let me just try out one of these i'm just gonna try the last one i got so this is going to generate colors uh okay let's figure this out hit the space bar to generate color schemes click on a color okay cool that's all all right all right this looks cool so let's spacebar get some colors let's just wait till we find one that looks like it's good for kids this is nice and bright all right let's let's pick this one all right so let's just go with this and what do y'all think oh wow i have a lot more links too i'll have to check all these out uh at some point but all right ready what do you think about this color palette i'll give everybody like 10 seconds to put in their opinions on this color palette i have about two minutes left a little over two minutes and then i'm gonna go to the chat and answer some questions so if you have any questions you put them in now all right let's cool it looks cool alright awesome oh okay wow you can do alternative shades you can do lots of cool stuff let's see about this exporting export palette scss wow interesting let's see what this looks like we can get an scss file yeah that's that might not be a bad idea i want to open this with code as well we can find it there it is okay opening code cool now we can just copy and paste these colors um we could probably put these in like an actual theme file if we wanted to and i believe we do have a theme so we created a color theme like down here and this is basically just like our background colors um but we could build out our theme a bit more and we already have it here right so we could say hero oops background color oh how did we do this edition background color trying to remember how i put this in here i might not have done it in a way that will work for what i wanted to do let's see oh okay i did do it the right way i thought since i actually used background color i thought for a second i was like locked into actually using css but all right let's say hero color and let's split this so i can just grab them all right let's give hero color did my oh my timer went off okay when we get back from uh answering some questions we'll just finish filling this out a little bit and then add in our colors and then that way we'll have a pretty easy mechanism for changing all the colors at once and at some point we could potentially give the user the ability to change the theme change the colors i think that would be kind of cool um based like me just observing my own kids they will spend so much time like customizing the colors and stuff um that might be cool for them like i know right now we have it like addition subtraction multiplication but maybe actually giving the user the ability to further customize the colors would would probably be a cool feature all right so let's start my timer over here all right so we'll do a short break and i'm going to scroll up and try to answer as many questions as i can um or alicia says uh make a code that stores students marks please using c plus um i don't really do c plus plus so i mean we could do code like that but um it would be like with javascript and not c plus benjamin says i love free code camp awesome uh comp sci guys so i was talking about building this for um like ios or android comp sci guy says we could just use react native init yeah we actually could maybe i'll try to do that um that might be good to try to do during a stream actually i expect them to run into issues because i just always do so uh that would be a good one for a stream so maybe we'll try to do that on the next stream i'd really love to have that available before i before next week because i want to demo it um at the conference sagemo jesse says uh their name is jesse too awesome i mentioned earlier that i thought i was getting sick imagine it sounds like you got the man flu been there before yeah unfortunately i have too much stuff to do and i can't just lay around which is what i would normally prefer to do when i'm sick um zach says these streams are great by the way thank you i appreciate that uh zach also asked if i work in pomodoro technique so the 25 minute code 5minute break i try to it's a little bit more difficult with my my new so my old job i was working on things mostly solo and i had like stuck to the pomodoro technique almost all the time with my new job i do a lot more pair programming and i'm in like an open office setting so it's harder to stick to that like the i i'm way more likely to just get interrupted in the middle of it or um like if i'm pair programming then it's hard to say like i would have to convince the other person i'm pairing with that like this is how we're gonna do it so i haven't found a great way to consistently use it but i'd really like to start using it again sorry all right sage mode says beginner here need to download python but it's kind of tricky don't think i'm doing it right also i heard you don't have to download javascript that's true yeah you javascript just runs on the browser uh you don't need to download it um i don't even remember how to download python like if i've done it it's been so long ago and i'm not sure there are some like in browser editors that will let you run python so you may want to check that out it might just let you get started faster with python without having to mess with the download benjamin says all the videos jesse records should be in a playlist right yep it is in playwrist so there is a huge playlist of all the live streams and that's just called live coding with jesse and then there are other playlists broken down by project so this particular project which we're on day 13 um has its own playlist with just like these 13 videos a couple you're asking how i am so i already addressed that earlier so i'm not gonna repeat it but uh you can basically i'm good so but you can check out the longer answer uh on the replay all right somebody who i can't pronounce their name it's in different characters keeps asking if i am dj smash i am not dj smash uh and once we do google dj smash so maybe i'll google that after the stream let's see um riyad says i am i'm not able to understand your english i'm sorry about that um yeah i'm not sure i'll try to speak as clearly as i can um but i'm not sure what else i could do about that i'd love to get subtitles for these at some point if anybody's interested in doing subtitles you know please let me know sy a myth says that they unsubscribed i'm sorry to hear that uh if you want to let me know why you unsubscribed i could try to do a better job then um although they not sure they're still stuck around if they already unsubscribe uh all right let me my timer went off so let's make a note of where i stopped at 7 40. let's see 751 in my chat okay all right let's see what's what's this time 809 okay i'm not gonna start another pomodoro timer we're just going to do a little bit more and then i'm going to finish up because if i do a whole nother pomodoro session i'm not going to have time to get through all the questions okay so let me get rid of that yeah don't say that let's just bring over these colors a bit and see if we can get our more reasonable color scheme okay oh background color let's change our background color uh do we want to go with the white background you want to go the colored background just let me know if you if you have an opinion on that i really love dark themes i'm like so tempted to just put this dark color as the background maybe i'll just try it we'll try it out see what happens all right hero color let's go with enemy enemy color and we'll give that the reddish color for now and oh let's do our button background as this yellow that seems cool i think the yellow actually looked really cool on the dark background button color okay i'm not sure what we'll do with the green let me see if we can figure out where that'll where that could go we don't have to use all the colors but yeah we're gonna have to change the color of the text as well so let's just put that in there for now text color let's just make this white for now oops okay that's pretty cool whoops uh comp sci guy mentioned i had an extra semicolon there thank you so much for uh for catching that all right so let's shrink this side up a bit we don't really need it and let's just try to add in these colors and see what it looks like so we need the font is gonna be the hardest thing the font color all right so we need to add uh let's see we need to add an array so we need to make our styles an array so for right now i'm just going to override whatever we have with our styles here so this will be fonts and this is we'll say there we go active theme dot text color and zeros okay and our hero wow so we have styles heroes styles character let's see um will this even matter yeah we have that svg there uh actually i think the background is still showing up so we still have some purple around the outside so let's do this and say background color and active theme the hero color what did i do oops there we go okay so um what we're doing here right is we're bringing in all the styles that we have in our style sheet at the bottom of character and of hero and then we're pulling in background colors so it'll it will cascade and like whatever comes last will override whatever was before it okay so we're already setting the background color for our hero um i believe here but it should be overridden by our background color here at least that's what i think is gonna happen all right now we have our enemies and we can do the same very a similar thing with our enemies background color active themed enemy color there we go we have more text here so we want to do style books equals font color active theme dot text oops text color and oh is our button so our button color is now going to be active theme dot button color and i think we have another button down here so let's oops yeah we're not going to be able to copy that because this one's a touchable opacity so let's make an object here and this will be background color button color nope not how it's supposed to go active theme dot button color and this needs to be in oops this needs to be an object there we go usually a good sign that you've messed up the syntax is when you're not getting your um autocomplete showing up uh okay we do have some more text that needs to be changed to the text color so fortunately these all have the same type of thing going on here so we're gonna use our multiple cursors so for the way my keyboard's set up which i don't know if this is the default for vs code or not i just press ctrl or command d and i can do this and get the multiple cursors right so uh we need to make this an object and then we'll make i'm sorry we need to make it an array first and then add in a style object um what was it font color that's it font color and that's going to be active theme dot text color verify that change for all of them yep all right cool i mean there's got to be a better way to do this at 2 because we're starting to get a lot of stuff happening in here so we'll try to find a better way to do it all right so let's save that and see if it worked oh okay it worked cool i'm not sure that that actually looks better oh you know it didn't work though this um this font color because it's not font color it's color i really did somebody catch that it's just color i don't know what i was thinking that's like basic css right there all right so let's find everywhere where we have font color and change it to color okay there we are okay and this might be uh we need to change it inside there but i don't know if i want to change it because i don't think that looks that good let me know what you think maybe it's just my screen i don't know but this does not look good to me where's our where's our code here it just this looks like it would look better on this screen but then when we actually did it here not not great yeah all right so it's saying colors are drab yeah it does look kind of drab all right well the good thing is this we now have an easy way to change all the colors in our in our app so now if we want to mess with new colors all we have to do is just change these not only that but we already set it up so that we could easily like change themes so what we could do is just have like four different themes or more if we really wanted to but for right now we're set up for four and just flip back and forth and really see which which ones we like better um see them side by side we can even open up a bunch like more than one window at a time sidebyside compare themes so uh although we didn't find a theme we really liked we did set it up so that it'll be easier to find that theme so i'm okay with that we also um tried an svg so probably not gonna use this svg but at least we have the silhouette of a humanlike form so let me um let me go ahead and commit this so you all can check out the code and play what if you want if you want to like mess with themes and stuff and if you find a cool one and want to do a pull request by all means please do that um but as soon as i commit this and push it to the git repo i'm gonna go through some questions and then uh finish up for today and go to my other job this is not really a job this is just a volunteer for fun type of thing so the job i get paid for i'll go to that next all right so let's do a git status oops let's make this bigger yep so we modified app.js git commits i'm going to say we're going to add do the add together with the commit and we're going to put the commit message in and let's just say um scg for hero and new theme and i'll do a git push all right all that code should be there um now i can also do a deploy so that the new code will be in that gh pages but i don't think i'm going to do it yet because i think the theme is actually uglier than the one that's currently out there so so i'm just gonna wait before i i push that to that uh demo link all right let's go to the chat and i believe we left off yeah 751 okay um all right there's a lot of discussion about when we were bringing that svg over so i'm gonna skip some of this because we already went over some of it um let's see all right so see there's a lot of cool links i'm gonna have to go through all those links that you all shared and check them out uh later on thank you for that i really appreciate it oh cool it looks like look good looks good looks good great awesome okay cool um looks like a lot of you thought it it looked alright what is he doing uh hanzo says hey i'm from brazil we're watching you awesome thanks uh muhammad asks if i do python i don't really code much in python i've done a little bit with it years ago but not i would not really consider myself to be good at python hanzo says make a tutorial in javascript um i do have some tutorial videos in on my channel i don't know if i actually have a javascript one a lot of it is more like getting all your dev environments set up using git and things like that void roamer says good morning what's going on where's the music stream uh the music stream should still be going so if you're looking for the music stream um just like get out of my stream and then i think the music stream is usually uh like always going like 24 7 so you may have to like search for it but it should be ups though um t says i don't want to interview for a dev job too early and lose a good opportunity with that company because i'm not ready when do i know i'm ready to start applying for web developer jobs um honestly i i think you're ready when you can convince somebody else that you're ready to to actually have a job right like that's that's all that really matters like if you can convince your interviewer that you can do the work then you'll get the job right so i mean to to convince yourself maybe you could do some practice interviews and see how you do um check out so on my youtube channel i do have some videos on interviewing and on my interview experience and i talk a lot more about um preparing for interviews so there's some good resources on there she might want to check that out i believe there's a link to my channel in the description of this video um lewis says are you from the netherlands i am not from the netherlands i'm from um from the u.s um benjamin asks why it's named p7d13 uh so it's uh project seven day 13. uh it looks like that already got answered in the chat so thank you t says you do kind of look like dj smash but not really all right i definitely have to look up this dj smash person after the stream ernesto says hey i like your videos uh thank you i appreciate that thanks for watching red light bd says i love your tutorial thank you benjamin says keep up the excellent work mate thanks man everybody's being so nice in this stream uh i actually thought i didn't do a great job because we i couldn't make anything look nice but uh i i really appreciate all the the positive uh encouragement there at yeah says i'm just starting to learn some back end development what technology do you do do you think i should be learning at this stage um it really depends like it depends on what you're using so like if you're using node for back end then you definitely want to be familiar with like node package manager like that whole ecosystem uh probably express um i mean of course like no matter what you're doing you want to learn about version control so most likely get um how to how to do stuff with with get um i don't know arguably if it's just you learning then you might want to learn a little bit about like actual deployment um and how to manage manage that manage like servers and stuff maybe some database stuff so it does kind of depend exactly on what you're working on but in general i think those things are pretty good to know at least a little bit about uh md uh is islam says i love your tutorial the wave explanation is nice oh thanks i'm glad you like it uh dead zombie says how do you import scss styles and react i see you always make separate styles object for your components but can i just have a separate sas file for my components um yes you can have a sas file but you got to be careful so like for the web that will work but if you're trying to run run this on mobile so like we're using react native and you can have a separate file for your css or scss scss yeah i said that right but you'll have to make sure that you're only pulling those in for web and you use the object version of css for mobile hopefully that makes sense maybe once we actually do start running mobile at the same time it'll make more sense um but if you're just doing like plane react and you're only going to build a web then yeah you can definitely use scss you just have to make sure your build pack like your your webpack config can handle that so depending on what you're using it might be already available to you to just write sas and it'll work or you may have to set that up on your own with webpack ernesto says soon i'm going to university to study software engineering any tips my only advice would be make sure you keep working on your own side projects and keep learning on your own with the latest stuff is in university just the way that that things work like it's hard for your professors to be on the cutting edge and teach you the latest stuff right because like they prepare all their stuff for class in advance so by the time they're actually teaching it it might be outdated so you'll learn a lot of the fundamentals of computer science but you may not learn what the latest tools and techniques are so just try to keep that up on your own comp side guy says i would make the background color that green color again okay so it's too dark yeah maybe maybe dark theme is not the right way to go for uh for the kids kidzap uh bartek says did anyone have such a problem with the github collaborators that they could not make any commits i'm not sure uh i haven't had any issues with that so i'm not sure what exactly issues you're facing maybe if you could explain a little bit more i could be more helpful to you um fanduel says what language do you do for your job um react native mostly and also um dotnet so it's like csharp.net core comp side guy says jesse i think your stream is awesome i like how you show true development it involves a bunch of trial and error and developers aren't super humans and we make mistakes yeah for sure i definitely make a lot of mistakes it says i'm working on a production production reactor a little bit of react native and we make mistakes all the time but we keep working till we get a solid product thanks i appreciate you saying that and yeah that's like kind of the whole idea behind the stream is just like this isn't going to be a perfect tutorial like this is just going to be working through things and i don't know how i'm gonna solve problems when i start the stream like we we figure it out together um yeah and we do make a lot of mistakes which is exactly how it goes for me at my real job as well um catalin says how do you make holy water um oh and it's the joke it's a joke okay how do you make holy water and the punch line is you boil the hell out of it i that's i thought you were serious for a second i was going to be like um i guess you need to find a priest but it was a joke um comp sci guy says does react native web ignore the gradle ios uh android files for the yarn start yes yes so actually we we built this with create react app and so it just runs the normal create react app start so it's gonna run like react script start yeah and then all those other normal files for like ios and android those only get get used when we um when we build for mobile okay all right i've gotten to the end of the chat thank you all so much for watching um i'm going to try to do another stream on friday i'd love to get another one in before next week because next week i'll be gone so i probably won't be able to stream maybe friday of next week so uh so keep a lookout on social media twitter on your notifications or whatever um on friday morning and hopefully i'll get another stream and then but until then i hope you have a great great couple of days and remember if anybody's in minnesota and wants to hang out let me know i'll be there next week and yeah thanks again everybody have a great day
