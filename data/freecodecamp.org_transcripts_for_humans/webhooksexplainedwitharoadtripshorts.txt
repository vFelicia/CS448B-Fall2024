00:00 - I'm sure you were starting to get like
00:02 - my kids doing a long drive and they're
00:03 - like Dad are we there yet
00:06 - actually that's a pretty good example
00:08 - for where a web hook works wonderfully
00:11 - my kids continually ask me that question
00:14 - over and over again are we there yet
00:16 - they keep making that request the same
00:19 - one over and over pulling me directly to
00:22 - see if we've arrived at our destination
00:24 - now typically my response is I'll tell
00:27 - you when we get there more or less what
00:29 - I'm promising is that when we get there
00:31 - I will broadcast our arrival status
00:35 - when that approach works like when my
00:37 - kids actually decide to subscribe to my
00:40 - status updates I can tell you that it
00:42 - makes things a lot easier on the whole
00:44 - car I don't get overloaded and they can
00:46 - relax they just sit there and wait for
00:49 - my update so much more efficient
00:52 - so I guess what I'm attempting to
00:53 - broadcast to you now is we're here we've
00:56 - arrived at the start of the course
