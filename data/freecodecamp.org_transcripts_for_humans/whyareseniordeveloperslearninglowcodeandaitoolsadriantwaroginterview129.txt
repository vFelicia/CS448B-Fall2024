00:00 - we had like a a brand new son in the
00:02 - world I wasn't sleeping we had a huge
00:04 - mortgage there was so many debts it was
00:06 - a very very stressful time and I was
00:08 - just thinking like one day I have to
00:10 - tell my son like what do I do as a job
00:13 - and I thought well I want to tell him
00:14 - that I followed my passions and I did
00:16 - something I was really excited about and
00:18 - so that's one of the reasons as well
00:20 - that I decided to take the risk leave
00:22 - what I knew for like 10 years of doing
00:24 - it and jump into web that I've never
00:26 - done before
00:29 - [Music]
00:46 - welcome back to the freec Cod Camp
00:48 - podcast I'm Quincy Larson teacher and
00:50 - founder of freecodecamp.org each week
00:53 - we're bringing you Insight from
00:54 - developers Founders and ambitious people
00:56 - getting into Tech and this week we are
00:58 - talking with none of other than Adrien
01:01 - torog developer designer and teacher of
01:05 - some of the most popular courses on
01:07 - using low code tools no code tools AI
01:10 - tools again he's a software engineer
01:13 - who's gone out of his way to learn these
01:14 - new kind of like contemporary power
01:16 - tools and apply them to get things done
01:18 - faster and he's going to be able to
01:19 - share some insight into how he does that
01:22 - Adrien welcome to the podcast hey Quincy
01:26 - uh thanks for having me on I'm really
01:27 - excited to do this cuz I'm working on
01:29 - some really cool stuff so I can't wait
01:31 - to share it but uh yeah let's get into
01:33 - it yeah man well uh you and I have known
01:36 - each other since really like I'm always
01:38 - proud of like scouting the talent as
01:40 - it's emerging you know like I saw very
01:42 - early on like wow this guy the
01:44 - production value of his courses the
01:46 - caliber of his teaching skills and his
01:48 - communication ability and just the charm
01:50 - of your courses like really struck me
01:53 - and so we are proud to have published
01:56 - several of your courses over the years
01:57 - on the Freo Camp YouTube channel and and
02:00 - I am proud to have learned quite a bit
02:01 - from you just like you know reading your
02:04 - articles and watching your videos and
02:05 - stuff
02:06 - so that's I wanted to take an
02:09 - opportunity yeah I wanted to take an
02:11 - opportunity to learn a little bit more
02:12 - about you in like your developer origin
02:15 - story uh I know you have like a computer
02:17 - science degree and everything but so
02:19 - many things about you are very
02:21 - unconventional like the way you approach
02:23 - technology you're you're like the
02:24 - extreme pragmatist in terms of like I
02:27 - just want to get stuff done you like all
02:29 - the talk about out the window all the
02:31 - you know um all the sacred rules are uh
02:34 - you know thrown onto the Altar and like
02:37 - set of
02:38 - Blaze yeah maybe you could talk about
02:41 - just and also another cool thing about
02:44 - you you grew up in Perth right Australia
02:47 - like yeah probably most isolated geog
02:50 - place in the whole world right yeah it's
02:53 - I mean geographically I don't think you
02:54 - could get farther from Silicon
02:56 - Valley yeah it's rough it's rough so got
03:00 - to be on the cloud essentially but uh
03:02 - YouTube's been a great place to be able
03:03 - to connect and meet people like you for
03:05 - example so it's been great yeah man well
03:09 - uh I'm excited to learn a little bit
03:10 - about your kind of developer origin
03:12 - story and how you guys started like do
03:14 - you remember as a kid like your first
03:17 - interactions with computers all right
03:19 - yeah I do um so when I was in Primary
03:24 - School my first uh use of computers was
03:26 - there was only one computer in the
03:28 - entire School and me being myself like I
03:31 - I was always on there using it and
03:33 - playing around in I think it was like uh
03:36 - Doss back then and just trying to like
03:38 - run commands or like unzip things and
03:40 - show them to my classmates so I was
03:42 - already like across all of that and I I
03:45 - I can see myself from a young kid
03:47 - enjoying that and so as I was in uh High
03:50 - School obviously information Tech was
03:52 - like kind of my favorite subject I
03:54 - scored 100% for everything and as I went
03:58 - to high school like that's pretty much
04:00 - what I was doing as well I was just
04:02 - enjoying that kind of stuff going to the
04:03 - library researching about it and at one
04:06 - point I have to design um decide a
04:08 - career path uh cuz I was going to
04:11 - college but my parents actually said
04:14 - don't do programming or web or anything
04:16 - there's no jobs in there it was still
04:18 - early days internet wasn't really that
04:20 - popular and they said I should do
04:21 - security because you know everyone will
04:23 - be all about computer security the money
04:26 - will be there and I was wasn't too sure
04:29 - but I did computer security and computer
04:31 - science at college and so I left webdev
04:35 - on the side and programming on the side
04:39 - and instead of doing the traditional
04:40 - route where people go to college and
04:42 - they learn about it I kind of treated it
04:45 - more like a hobby something I did on the
04:46 - side so like when Wikipedia came out I
04:49 - made my own Wikipedia clone I learned
04:51 - how to like code in PHP and I was
04:53 - learning all those Basics HTML CSS all
04:56 - the way back then like 10 15 years ago
04:59 - and and it was great it was really fun
05:01 - because it wasn't something I was
05:03 - studying it wasn't something I was going
05:05 - to work in cuz I was still learning to
05:07 - do computer science and I slowly pivoted
05:10 - towards it like doing it help desk
05:12 - installing Windows and servers and stuff
05:15 - like that and so web and programming was
05:18 - still always a hobby and I kept playing
05:20 - around with it I I kept learning like
05:22 - the latest JavaScript U methodologies
05:25 - and latest um implementations of esm or
05:29 - whatever it was called back then but um
05:32 - and then B Babel came across as well or
05:34 - Babel I think people call it Babble I
05:37 - was just reading I was just reading
05:38 - because I was an Enthusiast on that I
05:40 - just loved it and I had studied so much
05:44 - of programming that when I was in it and
05:47 - I wasn't enjoying it for um because I
05:50 - had I had graduated by that point and I
05:52 - got into the workplace I was working in
05:54 - it I didn't really like it cuz I was
05:55 - always dealing with problems always
05:57 - trying to like oh my computer doesn't
05:59 - turn on or this doesn't work and people
06:02 - were always grumpy and at one point I
06:04 - left that job cuz I was made redundant
06:07 - and I joined a marketing company when
06:09 - you were made redundant you were like
06:11 - laid off essentially or how does that uh
06:14 - well not really what ended up happening
06:17 - was um there was a downturn in the
06:20 - economy and people were asking for
06:22 - voluntary redundancies and so I asked I
06:26 - had been there for like five or six
06:28 - years already so I asked for a volunt
06:30 - redundancy so I had a bit of a pay um
06:33 - like a bit of a surplus like a safety
06:35 - net of cash there so I could try out
06:37 - webd and I felt like I'm going to have
06:40 - to start at the very beginning because
06:41 - I've got no experience whatsoever I have
06:44 - no idea what I'm doing I've never worked
06:46 - in web dev Dev before and strangely
06:50 - enough the passion of working at as a
06:54 - hobby for so many years actually meant
06:56 - that when I went into doing web dev
06:58 - doing like basic web websites from the
07:00 - ground up just coding them I was kind of
07:04 - good at it and I also still enjoyed
07:07 - doing it it was still like mentally it's
07:09 - like a hobby for me and so I found it
07:12 - amazing and not only that like within
07:16 - half a year of working at that marketing
07:17 - company they asked me to be one of the
07:19 - directors and buy into the company to be
07:21 - a shareholder and own a third of the
07:23 - company which I did like a partner and
07:26 - yeah I I became a partner exactly and so
07:29 - so suddenly this pivot of like swapping
07:32 - from it to web became amazing like I I
07:35 - felt like I was doing what I enjoyed
07:37 - every single day so for me I didn't
07:40 - traditionally study anything it was more
07:43 - like a hobbying hobby kind of thing
07:45 - where I was just following up on the
07:46 - latest news and so yeah I worked in that
07:49 - company for a few years and uh Co
07:52 - happened so when Co happened um I I'm
07:56 - want to stop you there because I just
07:58 - want to unpack some of the things
07:59 - that uh you shared cuz Co like I don't
08:04 - know anybody who made better use of that
08:06 - uh time than you uh and I've talked to a
08:10 - lot of people who were very busy
08:11 - including myself during that period
08:13 - making the most of the lockdowns and of
08:16 - the sudden surge in online like the
08:18 - interest in online learning and things
08:20 - like that uh we were very well
08:22 - positioned when we went into that I want
08:23 - to absolutely talk about that I do want
08:25 - to share a couple quick things about
08:27 - what you just said first of all um it's
08:30 - so cool how you were able to get out of
08:33 - you know it uh internet things and no
08:37 - it's not really internet things that's
08:38 - that's a joke if you've ever seen the IT
08:40 - Crowd I have I
08:42 - have yeah Information Technology like
08:45 - you were able to get out of like that
08:46 - kind of like help desk type uh you know
08:50 - often like looked at as is kind of like
08:53 - the I mean I don't want to slight
08:55 - anybody who's in it currently but many
08:57 - people are probably listening to this
08:58 - wanting to get into actual software
09:00 - development and things like that and and
09:02 - they're familiar with the uh you know
09:04 - the lack of respect that people
09:06 - generally have like you're the guy who
09:07 - fixes my computer do it you know yeah
09:10 - that's how it was really yeah yeah so
09:14 - you you worked you worked doing that for
09:16 - did you say six years uh six years in
09:19 - that company and then two years in
09:22 - Consulting beforehand and then another
09:24 - two years in the schooling system before
09:26 - that so probably like a decade 10 years
09:29 - fixing people's computers basically and
09:31 - setting up networks and stuff like that
09:33 - right did you have any of those
09:34 - certifications like the all of them
09:37 - micros ones and the VMware ones and the
09:40 - um Cisco ones yeah all of those back in
09:42 - the day the mcps and um Cisco asserts
09:45 - and whatnot okay wow so you like you
09:49 - were like a literal it guy so to speak
09:53 - like that I Grew From like to level two
09:55 - network engineer to level three system
09:57 - engineer to the senior Sy engineer yeah
10:00 - I did all of that so it wasn't how
10:03 - accurate go yeah how accurate to your
10:05 - day-to-day life was the show the IT
10:07 - Crowd the the British comedy did you
10:09 - ever watch that yeah yeah yeah I did
10:11 - it's um when you're talking with people
10:14 - it definitely feels like that kind of an
10:16 - experience where like they don't pluck
10:18 - in a cable and that's why something's
10:20 - not working and 90% of problems are
10:22 - fixed when you just turn something on
10:23 - and off even now today my camera wasn't
10:26 - working and so I rebooted my computer
10:28 - and then my camera's working working so
10:31 - it's like that that's so cool so for
10:33 - sure uh uh you talked about dos and I
10:36 - have to share this because I just
10:37 - learned this did you know that dos
10:39 - didn't originally stand for dis
10:41 - operating
10:42 - system okay it was originally called qos
10:47 - when Microsoft bought it and that stood
10:48 - for quick and dirty operating system oh
10:53 - because it was created it was just like
10:54 - thrown together very quickly and of
10:55 - course it became like this integral part
10:58 - of like
10:59 - you know I guess personal computers in
11:03 - general like pretty much every computer
11:04 - who that had Windows which was built on
11:06 - top of Dos but it was originally just
11:07 - some software that Microsoft purchased
11:09 - from this developer solo Dev who just
11:11 - built it because they were in a hurry to
11:13 - get an operating system together it was
11:15 - called quick and dirty dos and they
11:17 - thought we're not going to be able to
11:18 - sell something with dirty to the uh you
11:21 - know Enterprises of the world they don't
11:23 - want dirty software they want of course
11:26 - so they just remove the quick and dirty
11:27 - and they yeah they changed the uh quick
11:31 - and dirty operating system to Disk
11:33 - Operating System just to make it sound
11:35 - very generic kind of IBM like but uh
11:38 - yeah I just learned that and I wanted to
11:39 - share that with uh everybody listening
11:41 - because it's it's kind of a cool story
11:43 - TI but uh your company did like probably
11:46 - one of the dumbest things any company
11:48 - can do and that's basically like hey we
11:51 - don't have enough you know money to keep
11:53 - everybody on the staff if you
11:55 - voluntarily leave we'll give you like a
11:56 - one-time payout or something like that
11:58 - right yeah think about what is going to
12:00 - happen when you do that uh like any
12:02 - managers in the audience are probably
12:03 - like you know their hair is standing up
12:05 - on their arms thinking about like uh any
12:08 - company well this was a big company
12:10 - though it had like hundreds and hundreds
12:11 - of employees if I left it didn't really
12:13 - matter is likely to happen what is
12:15 - likely to happen sorry I hope I'm not
12:16 - interrupting we have a huge time
12:18 - difference between the two of us uh like
12:21 - again you're like as far geographically
12:22 - there's probably at least like you know
12:24 - half a second of latency between you and
12:27 - me right now um so
12:29 - think about what happens when you say
12:32 - hey uh anybody who wants to can leave
12:35 - and you'll get like a onetime payout
12:36 - like who is going to leave your company
12:38 - is it going to be the weakest people on
12:42 - the team who phoned in every day and
12:44 - like they're not going to want to go get
12:46 - on the job market they're not going to
12:47 - be confident in their skills who's going
12:49 - to take the payout and leave the Adrien
12:52 - twarog of the world who are like you
12:54 - know uh 10x developers like rock stars
12:58 - you know whatever you want to call them
12:59 - basically but people who get things done
13:01 - and are like passionate about what
13:04 - they're doing and are constantly
13:05 - expanding their skills and stuff those
13:07 - are the people that are going to walk
13:08 - out the door if you essentially bribe
13:10 - them to leave just so you can reduce
13:12 - your uh your headcount and your payroll
13:13 - and stuff so uh that is like basically
13:16 - the dumbest HR decision you can make
13:18 - like in my opinion as a manager if we
13:21 - ever got in a situation where we needed
13:22 - to do layoffs and you know knock on wood
13:25 - free C Camp's never had to do that and
13:27 - we we've like structured the entire
13:28 - thing like where we just save a ton of
13:30 - money and we keep costs as low as
13:32 - possible so we can keep all our
13:34 - instructional staff all our uh um you
13:37 - know all of our uh engineering team like
13:40 - in place uh but we would never do that
13:44 - we would just have those hard
13:45 - conversations and choose people and let
13:47 - them go because yeah like what your
13:49 - company basically did was they ensured
13:51 - that only the weakest people stay at the
13:53 - company and what happened to that
13:55 - company are they are they still yeah
13:57 - they're a huge organization so like
13:59 - they're a chamber of commerce
14:00 - essentially and so every single business
14:03 - in Perth is pretty much a member of them
14:06 - so they can wether like the Australian
14:08 - chamber like we have American Chamber of
14:10 - Commerce the West Australian Chamber of
14:13 - Commerce ah okay cool well I'm glad
14:16 - they're still around and that this
14:17 - wasn't like a fatal mistake but I do
14:19 - believe just extremely limited knowledge
14:22 - of the situation I think this is always
14:23 - a mistake and if your management ever
14:26 - offers you money to like leave the
14:27 - company you should take that money
14:29 - should run cuz that sign of like uh
14:32 - first of all ineptitude in the
14:33 - management and it's also uh you've got
14:36 - you can absolutely go out and get better
14:37 - opportunities right um so and to add to
14:41 - that story as well it wasn't as easy as
14:43 - I make it sound at that point in time
14:46 - like I had no savings whatsoever um my
14:50 - wife and I had just gave birth to oh my
14:52 - wife gave birth to our son and so we had
14:56 - like a a brand new son in the world I
14:58 - was wasn't sleeping we had a huge
15:00 - mortgage there was so many debts it was
15:02 - a very very stressful time and I was
15:05 - just thinking like one day I have to
15:06 - tell my son like what do I do as a job
15:09 - and I thought well I want to tell him
15:11 - that I followed my passions and I did
15:12 - something I was really excited about and
15:14 - so that's one of the reasons as well
15:16 - that I decided to take the risk leave
15:18 - what I knew for like 10 years of doing
15:20 - it and jump into web that I've never
15:22 - done before so it yeah it was a very
15:25 - tough decision but like I'm really happy
15:26 - I did it yeah you followed your dreams
15:29 - man uh and I I want to like dig in a
15:32 - little bit more into those dreams cuz we
15:34 - just like you know got into your 30s
15:36 - basically very quickly probably uh maybe
15:39 - we can talk about um what those dreams
15:42 - were early on like you uh just inputting
15:45 - commands into Doss being kind of
15:47 - delighted and enthralled by just the
15:50 - most fundamental aspects of working with
15:53 - computers uh what were your dreams do
15:55 - you do you remember so I always like
15:58 - building ideas
15:59 - um whether they were little projects or
16:01 - little startups um I think the very
16:03 - first thing that I couldn't do was get
16:06 - some really cool games that were being
16:07 - released in Japan and so I figured out a
16:10 - way to get a like go to a Japanese
16:14 - website manually translated download
16:16 - their emulator and ROM and then run
16:18 - those games locally at my school
16:20 - computers and I'm like all right I
16:22 - figured out this like really complex
16:23 - solution and these games are still in
16:25 - Japanese but they're still fun to play
16:27 - and then after that I thought when I'm
16:30 - going to high school I wanted to build a
16:32 - little system that keeps all my notes
16:34 - for me basically OTE or one note today
16:38 - and later after that Wikipedia came out
16:40 - as well and then um after that I'm like
16:43 - all right what other ideas can I build
16:45 - so I always was kind of building ideas
16:48 - and I built them in private and
16:50 - sometimes I built the whole thing and I
16:52 - didn't know how to release it sometimes
16:54 - I built half of them but I was always
16:56 - this is the hobby side of things where I
16:58 - always was enjoying that process of
17:00 - creating
17:01 - things and programming let me do
17:04 - that so your passion for games LED you
17:07 - to like find these kind of cool
17:08 - workarounds with emulation and stuff
17:10 - like that uh I'm I'm obviously like like
17:13 - I can tell from your your background by
17:14 - the way I just want to compliment your
17:15 - background that's a real background that
17:17 - is not a green screen uh you can reach
17:20 - out and touch that YouTube uh 100,000
17:23 - subscriber
17:25 - award you can touch that Pikachu
17:29 - yeah that is anybody who's listening to
17:32 - the audio version uh if you get a chance
17:34 - to check out the video version you can
17:35 - see his background but uh you know we we
17:37 - keep this like I intentionally keep the
17:39 - visuals to a minimum here so everybody
17:41 - who's listening to the audio version
17:42 - gets the full basically The Full
17:44 - Experience other than looking at me and
17:45 - whatever video game I've got like one of
17:47 - those three kingdom arcade games uh in
17:50 - the background right going so you don't
17:52 - have to just look at my face you can
17:53 - look at the cool video game in the
17:54 - background if you get tired of looking
17:56 - at my face uh but you've got a really
17:58 - rocking background so
18:00 - um I'm excited to hear that like you
18:03 - were into games early on and that kind
18:05 - of further fueled your passion for
18:08 - technology that is definitely a Common
18:09 - Thread among a lot of the people that we
18:11 - have on the free podcast is uh yeah like
18:15 - that's that I used to say that like the
18:17 - way that like most of the developers I
18:19 - talked to got into software development
18:22 - was through like a passion for games
18:24 - right doing something like uh just
18:26 - learning how to like you know do like a
18:29 - route on um like a like Super Nintendo
18:33 - uh SNES mini or something like that or
18:36 - learning how to uh sideload stuff onto
18:38 - like an Android phone and like be able
18:40 - to have hundreds of thousand of when I
18:41 - was in primary school no sorry High
18:43 - School I bought myself a pal like I
18:45 - worked a day job and bought myself one
18:47 - of the original like touch device Palms
18:49 - that HP released and so like I would
18:51 - load different software on yeah the PD I
18:54 - was like the only person in the entire
18:55 - school with one so that's pretty you
18:59 - they must have thought you were like a
19:00 - drug dealer or
19:01 - something what may expensive consumer
19:04 - electronics thing exactly
19:07 - exactly yeah but but you P you uh
19:10 - prioritize getting these kinds of tools
19:12 - because you enjoy technology exactly so
19:15 - even now like I love down um grabbing
19:18 - like the latest Oculus Rift or VR and
19:20 - seeing like how can I play around with
19:22 - it what can I do inside of there that
19:23 - isn't otherwise available um I like
19:27 - playing around with Raspberry Pi is or
19:29 - even just getting a projector and seeing
19:30 - if I can like connect up the Raspberry
19:32 - Pi to a projector and then just like run
19:34 - it on a solar panel or something like
19:35 - that it's just fun putting different
19:37 - ideas together like that so you have
19:40 - kind of like a
19:41 - recombinative uh approach to like
19:43 - technology like taking a bunch of
19:45 - off-the-shelf things like almost modules
19:47 - and putting them together and uh we're
19:50 - going to talk a lot about that during
19:51 - this interview because you are a huge
19:54 - staunch advocate of using like low code
19:56 - tools no code tools AI tools to get
20:00 - things done and kind of like glue your
20:02 - custom code together or your custom code
20:04 - is rather gluing these powerful tools
20:07 - together um and building applications
20:09 - but it's like you're you're playing with
20:11 - power tools instead of you know Hammers
20:13 - and and saws um and that that is
20:16 - definitely the vibe I've gotten from you
20:17 - and a lot of what I know about lood I've
20:19 - learned from you oh thanks yeah no um
20:23 - look like when I used to so I love
20:26 - drones as well flying drones and
20:28 - everything and so like 5 10 years ago
20:31 - before DJI made prebuilt drones they
20:33 - would just sell you the kit and the
20:35 - flight computer and everything you'd
20:36 - have to Pro I would program my own
20:38 - flight computer connect it up to a
20:40 - controller configure the controller um
20:43 - solder all the components together and
20:45 - then learn to fly it right and so one of
20:48 - the things that I learned Lear early on
20:50 - is I learned a lot by doing that that it
20:52 - was a lot of fun but now it's so much
20:54 - easier when the Drone is built for you
20:55 - and everything set up and so if you
20:58 - think about npm and npm packages that's
21:01 - kind of the same thing they kind of
21:02 - solve problems for you and they're me
21:04 - ready for you to use and one step
21:07 - further from that is like the no code
21:09 - tools and low code tools they're ready
21:11 - for you to use so you don't have to
21:12 - rebuild the same thing from the ground
21:14 - up and that's why I've kind of always
21:16 - been at that bleeding edge of technology
21:19 - so whether it was back in the day like
21:21 - the programming whether it was the low
21:23 - code and whether it is AI now that's
21:25 - kind of like the Horizon I like to be
21:27 - across and the kind of content I like to
21:29 - do as
21:31 - well yeah and uh before we get too much
21:34 - into that like I I do want to talk about
21:36 - a little bit about your career
21:37 - progression after you left it uh again
21:40 - taking a big risk you said you had a
21:42 - mortgage you had a newborn son uh and
21:45 - wife wasn't working either it's just all
21:48 - on my shoulders for the for the salary
21:50 - so it was yeah aough decision entire
21:52 - fam's putting you know putting food on
21:54 - the table was down to you and your
21:57 - ability security if you work at a job
21:59 - for six years you have security there
22:01 - right and if you have a mortgage you
22:03 - know the bank looks at how long you've
22:04 - been working at a job if I just jump
22:06 - jobs to a new job from that job I go
22:11 - into a career I've never gone into so
22:13 - I'm at the very bottom and I take a
22:15 - salary cut where my salary basically
22:17 - gets cut in half from what I was working
22:20 - at so like before I was working on a
22:22 - about 80,000 and I dropped down to
22:26 - 40,000 a year so it was like a huge cut
22:29 - in salary so yeah it was a scary thing
22:31 - to
22:32 - do yeah I can only imagine uh and it
22:37 - sounds like you started at the bottom
22:40 - like can you describe what it was like
22:42 - arriving some guy uh you were probably
22:44 - in your late 20s early 30s at this point
22:46 - like showing up at the developer Bullpen
22:49 - like uh what was that what were those
22:51 - first few months like working as a
22:54 - developer um it was interesting cuz I
22:56 - was coming into this company replacing
22:59 - one of the other developers right and so
23:01 - he would normally spend one month to
23:03 - build a website and then I would come in
23:06 - now and I would build that entire
23:07 - website in a week same kind of website
23:10 - and I'm just like all right why did it
23:11 - take him a month to make it and so it
23:15 - was the very first time I had ever done
23:16 - it working properly in a job so then the
23:19 - next time I built the website built it
23:20 - in 5 days then the next time I build it
23:22 - in 4 days and the other guy was still
23:24 - building it he was now subcontracting
23:26 - for the company cuz he wanted to work
23:27 - somewhere else
23:29 - um he was still taking a month to do it
23:30 - and I was now taking 4 days to do it and
23:33 - so slowly over time I realized that like
23:37 - programming is a bit of a skill if you
23:39 - don't upskill you're always going to
23:42 - stay at the same time um place and I
23:43 - think this guy was set in his ways he
23:46 - wasn't developing his skill sets he was
23:48 - just kind of reusing what he knew and it
23:50 - was taking him a long time whereas I was
23:52 - always upskilling and that upskilling
23:54 - had a huge benefit over time and so
23:57 - that's why I was was a lot further ahead
23:59 - than him even though it was the very
24:01 - first job I ever worked at it was the
24:02 - very first few websites I have ever ever
24:04 - created just my hobbying and learning
24:07 - and always staying up to um base with
24:10 - what's happening in programming had me
24:13 - further ahead than him who had been
24:14 - working in it for 10
24:16 - years yeah wow and it sounds like uh you
24:21 - you very much have like a growth mindset
24:23 - so to speak and uh you just proactively
24:25 - are out there absorbing I mean you use
24:27 - the term bleeding Edge earlier uh you
24:29 - like to stay right at at the at the for
24:33 - Forefront it's ahead of The Cutting Edge
24:35 - it's the bleeding edge C things might
24:37 - die or they might come to fruition like
24:40 - I remember when react came out for for
24:43 - the very first time and nobody was using
24:46 - it at all it was like so new that there
24:48 - wasn't even like a a release it was just
24:51 - like a thing on Facebook and I was
24:52 - already using it then and node came out
24:54 - and I'm like all right this is going to
24:56 - you sometimes you can just tell these
24:58 - are going to be the technologies that
25:00 - stay I was already at node at like 0.02
25:03 - or whatever the release was early early
25:05 - on um and yeah building tools with it so
25:09 - it was it was great fun and it just
25:11 - meant that as I saw them progress and as
25:14 - each new change log came in I was
25:16 - reading every single line that was being
25:18 - released every new feature that was
25:20 - there um kind of like how bun is out
25:22 - there now and um Deno like as soon as
25:25 - that got released like I'm always there
25:27 - essentially yeah awesome shout out to
25:30 - the Deno subreddit which I'm the sole
25:33 - moderator of because I it's happened so
25:35 - many times I I may have told this story
25:37 - before like some new technology comes
25:39 - out and some big Corporation comes in
25:41 - and like squats the subreddit
25:43 - essentially so I was like I'll show them
25:45 - I'm going to get the D subredit so that
25:47 - no no bad actor can get it I I should
25:50 - probably do that more frequently when
25:51 - they announce new technologies go find
25:53 - the and I mean it wasn't just like I
25:55 - didn't just go and like oh I'd like the
25:56 - dental sub like any four character
25:58 - combination or something like that is
25:59 - probably going to be taken I had to go
26:00 - through this lengthy process with like
26:02 - the Reddit you know overlords to get it
26:04 - but I was able to get it um getting a
26:07 - domain essentially our nonprofits I have
26:09 - that one although I haven't really done
26:11 - anything with it uh because there most
26:12 - people just use r nonprofit but um sorry
26:16 - total tangent but so what you're saying
26:20 - is it's almost like you're you're like
26:22 - the venture capitalist of learning in
26:24 - terms of you know you're taking risky
26:27 - speculative you you're investing risky
26:30 - speculative amounts of time in learning
26:32 - these new tools which may or may not
26:34 - become mainstream uh you know for every
26:37 - for every uh nodejs there are like you
26:40 - know 20 different technologies that just
26:43 - like do you remember you know gulp well
26:45 - guess guess who yeah I do I was using
26:47 - that and guess who was using open AI two
26:50 - years before chat GPT came out this guy
26:54 - awesome I did use it a little bit with
26:56 - gpt2 uh like the public Edition the the
26:59 - the playground I think they called it
27:01 - back in the day and I was like just but
27:03 - it was a spectacle I wasn't actually
27:04 - using it to do any work I was just like
27:06 - isn't this cool you know but but you
27:09 - were you actually using it to get work
27:10 - done it and I would I would build
27:13 - applications on there for my marketing
27:15 - company to do things like generate ads
27:18 - that now like every company is trying to
27:20 - do that but back then there wasn't the
27:22 - appetite for that and in order to use
27:25 - their API for like one task you had to
27:29 - go through a safety checklist of like 20
27:32 - Questions showing examples and your code
27:34 - to go through andove the use of
27:37 - something that's only 20 tokens 20
27:39 - tokens was the limit which if you think
27:42 - about it that's like one or two
27:45 - sentences yeah was saying back then so
27:48 - limited and you can't have like it
27:49 - doesn't store stuff in memory like what
27:51 - gbt and these newer tools uh like I
27:55 - think Claude can hold like 100,000
27:57 - tokens or something and it's context
27:58 - window uh so you were working with the
28:00 - most primordial primitive versions of
28:03 - these tools and you were still finding
28:05 - ways to use them yeah one of the cool
28:07 - ideas I had was um and this is something
28:09 - I built out and then sold was a micro
28:12 - auto complete and so because the context
28:15 - window was so small what I would do is I
28:17 - would grab the last um five paragraphs
28:20 - you wrote and then it would guess the
28:22 - next two words you're right and so it's
28:24 - almost like the auto complete you have
28:26 - in vs code but because it's only um
28:28 - guessing the next two words you have
28:30 - it's really quick it's like when you go
28:31 - on Gmail sometimes and you go hello and
28:34 - it just fill out hello you know Quincy
28:36 - and sometimes just fills out those two
28:38 - words but when you're writing a document
28:40 - sometimes that's useful and you could
28:41 - just hit tab tab tab tab tab tab tab and
28:43 - it wres out a sentence for you so I had
28:45 - to be creative in the ways that I would
28:47 - like utilize open AI back then yeah so
28:51 - getting in early with the tools I I want
28:53 - to get back to your uh your office like
28:55 - how did your bosses react seeing like
28:57 - wow this new kid is really fast at
28:59 - building stuff like what were your first
29:02 - uh how can we make more money for for
29:04 - this right so for them um they thought
29:07 - all right one they can do more sales so
29:10 - their sales pipeline increased but two
29:13 - it unfortunately it meant we can sell
29:16 - websites cheaper now because rather than
29:19 - 40 hours to make a website it only takes
29:22 - Adrian 8 hours to make a website and so
29:25 - instead of charging $10,000 for a webs
29:28 - it now will charge $2,000 for the for a
29:30 - website and so what ended up happening
29:33 - is the company doesn't actually makes
29:34 - more money I just get more busy with
29:37 - more work for the same amount of money
29:39 - and that was one of the issues I had I
29:41 - suppose working at the marketing company
29:43 - like it ended up being just me working a
29:45 - whole lot like I enjoyed programming but
29:48 - I didn't end up making any more money
29:51 - nor did the company make any more money
29:53 - so that's where I started thinking I
29:55 - need to think of other ways to to make
29:58 - money whether it is startup ideas or
30:01 - creative Endeavors or something I I was
30:03 - thinking what can I do and so that was
30:05 - always in the back of my uh mind and I
30:07 - started you know reaching out to friends
30:09 - and trying to see where can I get ideas
30:11 - for doing
30:13 - that yeah so how long were you with this
30:16 - company ultimately uh probably five
30:19 - years where you were now a partner for
30:21 - five years okay yeah so so five years
30:24 - and when do you remember when you left
30:26 - did you leave before the pandemic
30:28 - uh no aftera after um
30:32 - so go on you've got a question that I
30:34 - can hear it yeah yeah yeah like like
30:36 - we're getting we're ramping up to the
30:37 - the main course of the Adrien toog Saga
30:41 - which is the pandemic but uh like so
30:44 - during this time you're you're kind of
30:46 - feeling I mean it sounds like they
30:48 - probably could have found some happy
30:50 - medium between charging $10,000 of or a
30:52 - website in charging 2,000 and maybe it
30:54 - was closer to like 5,000 that the market
30:56 - would have borne I don't know but it it
30:58 - feels like just be you know they should
31:00 - have adjusted the rates to reflect the
31:02 - increased productivity uh that you were
31:05 - doing and were you teaching anybody else
31:07 - or were you like the sole developer at
31:08 - this company so first year I was working
31:10 - with them um and they saw you know I'm a
31:13 - pretty good person to work with second
31:15 - year I became a partner um and I owned a
31:17 - portion of the business third year um we
31:21 - started hiring stuff we grew the team to
31:23 - 10
31:25 - people um then the fourth year the
31:28 - pandemic happened so like the third year
31:30 - I had like I actually hired two or three
31:31 - developers at that point in time so I
31:33 - was actually mentoring people um and
31:36 - then the fourth year Co happened so we
31:38 - had to let go of those stuff because we
31:40 - didn't have the money for it and when Co
31:43 - hit and we're were all working from home
31:46 - and that's when I started
31:49 - YouTube yeah and again as I said earlier
31:52 - like nobody that I know made better use
31:55 - of that time than you did in terms of
31:57 - just establish yourself as a teacher
32:00 - yeah tell me and I decided I watched
32:03 - everyone on YouTube and they're all
32:05 - making tutorials so the way I decided to
32:07 - make my content was how about I show
32:10 - people real websites which I'm working
32:12 - at my company and since I'm director I
32:14 - can you know decide what I'm going to
32:15 - publish or not how about I show them
32:17 - real websites I'm building for clients
32:19 - and they can get an idea of this and
32:21 - I'll also turn them into templates so
32:23 - that they can download themselves and
32:24 - utilize for their own clients and so
32:27 - every every day I was working and every
32:29 - day I was recording myself work and so I
32:32 - had videos every day come out um I think
32:35 - I made about 300 videos in the year of
32:37 - Co which is absolutely insane um but
32:42 - that was pretty much just me every day
32:44 - going to work doing my work recording
32:46 - myself and then collecting whatever the
32:48 - gold nuggets are from that and then
32:50 - publishing it and then I finish my
32:52 - workday and then I'd do the next work
32:54 - day and I'd record myself while I'm
32:55 - doing my work and publish a video so I
32:58 - would not only get my work done but I'd
33:00 - also have video content out there and
33:02 - grow that YouTube channel which was a
33:04 - great time to
33:05 - do yeah man 301 year so basically like
33:11 - pretty much every day uh and and this is
33:12 - while you had you know a youngish child
33:15 - exactly it still meant like I was still
33:18 - doing my um Family responsibility still
33:20 - playing with my son going out to family
33:22 - events and then at the end of the day
33:24 - everyone's asleep at 7:00 p.m. I'm like
33:27 - all right well I've got an hour or two
33:28 - I'm going to record a tutorial and then
33:30 - I'm going to publish it and so even
33:32 - Saturdays and Sundays I would knock
33:34 - those out as well wow and just to let
33:37 - everybody know who's watching this again
33:39 - you're in Perth here in Texas it is 9:46
33:43 - a.m. when we're recording this like what
33:45 - time is it over there uh it's closing
33:47 - into 11:00 p.m. yeah so you it sounds
33:51 - like you're a night ow or you've
33:52 - acclimated to being able to you know
33:54 - work late at night um in a way that most
33:58 - are not able to a lot of coffee but um a
34:01 - r what time do you stop drinking coffee
34:03 - just out of curiosity oh um I usually
34:07 - like to break it up between meals so
34:08 - like one before breakfast one um one
34:12 - after lunch and then one after dinner so
34:15 - interesting so you're like literally
34:16 - drinking coffee after dinner 6 p.m.
34:18 - you're drinking coffee yeah yeah what
34:20 - time do you usually go to bed um around
34:23 - 11: or 12 oh okay so so like we're we're
34:26 - cring up against your your bedtime so
34:28 - you're yeah uh so if I reach to the
34:31 - screen and kind of like shake your
34:32 - shoulder
34:33 - to this is the time for lighting cuz I
34:36 - don't have any sun or anything coming
34:38 - through no harsh lights I can like set
34:39 - up the scene really well for the
34:42 - backdrop and everything like that man
34:43 - your lighting approach is totally
34:44 - different like I'm in front of like big
34:46 - you know Windows basically and I just
34:48 - use all natural lighting uh I don't know
34:51 - I I just like like having through 1 two
34:55 - three four five six seven
34:58 - eight nine 10 10 lights that I control
35:03 - wow so it's like a like a moon landing
35:05 - over there you it looks like a complete
35:09 - mess outside of the frame but inside of
35:11 - the frame it looks
35:13 - great yeah man I also have a fog machine
35:16 - as well to add like a little bit of that
35:18 - Haze in the
35:20 - background yeah really you have you so
35:23 - you're you're actually like adding
35:25 - texture to the background with it also
35:27 - this low Rand the lights which is nice
35:29 - so you'll find that a lot of people that
35:31 - do cinematic scene setups that's they
35:33 - always have a
35:34 - hazer a hazer that sounds like something
35:38 - that only a fraternity would
35:41 - have Okay
35:43 - so let's talk about um let's talk let's
35:47 - talk about like your day-to-day workflow
35:50 - during Co because I mean you establish
35:52 - that at night you're I mean you're
35:53 - drinking coffee all day you're you're
35:55 - doing normal family stuff but you're
35:57 - you're also you know excusing yourself
36:00 - from dinner with your thing of coffee
36:02 - going into your your workshop and you're
36:05 - recording tutorials you're publishing
36:07 - them and you're not just like when you
36:09 - publish on YouTube YouTube is not just
36:11 - like oh I'll just upload the video like
36:13 - you got to do some editing probably you
36:14 - have to like come up with a fun
36:16 - thumbnail uh thumbnail is very important
36:19 - uh you'll see a lot of experimentation
36:20 - with the
36:21 - thumbnails uh on uh YouTube and thanks
36:24 - to Bo KS uh who runs the free cocain
36:27 - YouTube for for coming up with some of
36:29 - these silly thumbnails um but uh yeah
36:33 - the getting people to actually click
36:34 - through and watch your video that's
36:36 - important so originally like everybody
36:39 - starts up uploading and maybe YouTube
36:41 - will throw you like three or five views
36:43 - or something like that right like I
36:44 - frequently watch videos that have like
36:46 - no views that sounds weird but like
36:48 - sometimes I'll be like the first person
36:50 - to watch a video and I'll be like wow
36:52 - it's like so cool it's it's cool to be
36:54 - like in the ground floor but um yeah
36:57 - like like what was your early YouTube
36:59 - growth like so it it's a tricky thing
37:02 - because when I came in it felt like the
37:04 - whole scene was so saturated there are
37:06 - so many people doing content there was
37:08 - like this deved guy which was like funny
37:11 - and this like web def simplified guy
37:13 - with like beautiful hair and like I I'm
37:15 - just like how do I get into this scene
37:18 - and so I thought it was impossible but I
37:20 - thought all right what I'm good at is um
37:23 - like breaking things down and improving
37:26 - them like I'm always at the Forefront of
37:28 - that and so when I made videos say I
37:31 - wanted to do one on CSS animation and I
37:33 - had to do one better than um Kevin um
37:36 - what I would do is the Cs the king of
37:39 - CSS exactly and so I would look at his
37:42 - video like I would search something like
37:44 - U for example CSS animations right I
37:46 - would look at his video I would then
37:48 - have a look at every other video in
37:50 - search I would go through the video and
37:53 - see every topic he covered then I would
37:56 - research CSS animation and I would write
37:58 - up a script that covers everything he
38:01 - did plus extra in a shorter and more
38:04 - succinct amount of time with a better
38:06 - thumbnail and a better title better tags
38:08 - better description more um uh timestamps
38:13 - even though time stamps weren't even a
38:14 - thing back then as well as rather than
38:17 - 1080p which was thing I was already on
38:19 - 4K back then I was like having a look at
38:21 - every single thing I can do to create a
38:24 - video that is better than whatever was
38:27 - ly there on search so whether it was a
38:29 - video about CSS animation whether it was
38:31 - about react and its implementations
38:33 - whether it was about bootstrap every
38:36 - video I researched I had to look at how
38:37 - can I improve on all the videos that are
38:39 - out there and make a better video and
38:41 - that's kind of how I did it every single
38:43 - day day down by day and I tried to
38:45 - improve by 1% every time as well so each
38:48 - time I had a little bit more budget I'd
38:50 - get a better microphone I'd get you know
38:52 - I started off with no backdrop and then
38:54 - I got you know a bookshelf and I filled
38:56 - it out with stuff and I got a better
38:58 - um lighting setup so bit by bit it
39:00 - eventuated to where I am now
39:02 - essentially yeah wow so one thing to
39:05 - note like uh first of all I love the way
39:07 - that you just kind of incrementally
39:09 - upgraded stuff as your budget could
39:11 - provide um and you know you can make
39:13 - money on YouTube which we can talk about
39:15 - in a little bit uh but it's not like you
39:17 - know Scrooge McDuck jumping into the
39:19 - Vault and swimming around in the coins
39:21 - by the way if you actually ever have a
39:23 - vault filled with like gold coins and
39:25 - stuff don't attempt to dive into it
39:29 - um but that might hurt yeah yeah it
39:32 - might hurt might leave it in um so you
39:37 - uh it sounds like you were able to focus
39:40 - on like different production
39:41 - considerations and stuff but it is worth
39:44 - noting that you are a skilled teacher
39:46 - those years you spent at the agency
39:49 - training other developers in different
39:51 - cont you know Concepts and stuff spent
39:54 - in it explaining things right but but
39:56 - like that time it sounds like you did
39:58 - learn a lot about like how to
40:00 - communicate knowledge how to impart
40:02 - knowledge um because no I didn't
40:05 - actually that's that's the thing that I
40:07 - think a lot of people skip out on that
40:09 - that's not where I learned I learned it
40:12 - from watching People's videos as I said
40:14 - and doing the research researching how
40:17 - they're delivering their topics and then
40:18 - also going and researching how um the
40:22 - details are on like CSS animation on
40:25 - different websites and then putting that
40:26 - into a for formula script that has no
40:30 - fluff so like one of the things that I
40:31 - don't do very well on my videos is
40:33 - there's not much personality I don't add
40:35 - many jokes there's not much like um
40:38 - stuff like that it's just pure like
40:41 - what's the pure essence of how I can
40:43 - teach a concept in as little words as
40:47 - possible so you really optimize for
40:49 - tness and uh man you're like the first
40:52 - person I think that's ever actually like
40:54 - said no I'm not a great teacher you know
40:56 - like like has deflected deflected my uh
41:00 - attempt at at uh edifying you uh but but
41:03 - I mean that makes sense so you you
41:04 - really took like a clinical approach to
41:06 - this dissecting what makes things work
41:10 - uh as opposed to like like almost like
41:12 - like uh a Quant might tear apart like a
41:15 - baseball team and figure out like why
41:16 - are we actually losing these games like
41:19 - completely uh like passionless and just
41:22 - very uh well yeah exactly you to have a
41:24 - look like where is the wind resistance
41:26 - coming from the B what's the better Tire
41:28 - you can use how can you make the frame a
41:30 - little bit um less heavy like every bit
41:33 - by bit by bit by bit um because like the
41:35 - cyclist is going to cycle he's going to
41:36 - like move his wheels but it's all the
41:38 - other things that goes behind the scenes
41:40 - that if you're cycling 40 kilm these 1%
41:44 - gains they have a lot of
41:46 - traction interesting so it's a very
41:48 - marginal kind of um approach to
41:52 - gradually just teching up different
41:54 - aspects of your videos I wouldn't say
41:56 - that my videos suddenly made me
41:58 - successful it was definitely a linear
42:00 - path of success that might have had a
42:02 - little bit of a escalation um ju to
42:05 - those 1% but like uh what did they say
42:08 - about interest there was a saying for
42:10 - that I mean it compound over 300 videos
42:13 - a 1% increase is you're going to have
42:15 - the best videos on in the universe if
42:17 - you can actually do 100 1% for 300
42:19 - iterations in a row um yeah that's
42:22 - pretty phenomenal I actually I might be
42:24 - incorrect uh I would have to pull up my
42:26 - uh calculator CU I can't do that sort of
42:28 - stuff in my head figure out like what
42:30 - what is the total Improvement that would
42:33 - be experienced if you were to improve 1%
42:35 - for 300 days ask GPT that real quick I
42:38 - think it's
42:41 - 37.5 times over a year if it's 1% per
42:44 - day
42:45 - MH you would get if you improved 1% each
42:51 - day for 300 days yeah and it's going to
42:54 - do some python here probably so just
42:57 - yeah it shows me the it's just a
42:59 - compound interest formula
43:01 - um yeah and so it's it's calculating it
43:05 - with python I'm just dictating what what
43:07 - GPD is is doing essentially uh it's is
43:11 - 20.99 times the initial amount uh yeah
43:15 - it's pretty good it's like a you know
43:18 - 2,000 and I can see that I can show you
43:20 - like my old videos and you'll see that
43:22 - it's very clear and obvious how much of
43:24 - an improvement that there is and that's
43:26 - why any of my advice to people that want
43:29 - to be creatives and do content on
43:31 - YouTube is do 100 videos it's the same
43:33 - thing Jimmy slm Beast says do 100 videos
43:37 - that'll help you improve the most and
43:38 - then after that figure out what topics
43:40 - you want to do yeah yeah or as I was
43:44 - told uh by the uh writer at Denny's
43:46 - where I was drinking coffee who saw me
43:49 - like working on a draft uh was like
43:51 - throw your first million words away just
43:53 - keep writing and uh it's gonna take time
43:57 - quality takes time and it sounds like uh
43:59 - you you just incrementally improved each
44:02 - facet of these videos and that's how you
44:04 - arrived at your current level of quality
44:07 - which you know when we say current level
44:08 - of quality it's probably still climbing
44:10 - right are you still finding little ways
44:12 - to improve always always yeah so what I
44:16 - like to do go oh go ahead go ahead I
44:19 - still like to research other verticals
44:22 - when I say verticals I mean like
44:23 - channels in say photography or channels
44:26 - in
44:27 - um design or channels in um lifestyle
44:31 - and have a look at like what kind of
44:32 - things are they doing that I can
44:34 - Implement into the coding space to make
44:36 - programming videos a little bit more
44:40 - enjoyable yeah because you're so
44:42 - passionate about programming technology
44:44 - but not everybody's just born trying
44:48 - different commands in Doss right like a
44:49 - lot of people uh they need something to
44:53 - like ignite that passion you need to
44:54 - hold their attention long enough for
44:56 - them to
44:57 - really cultivate an interest in going
44:59 - deeper with
45:01 - technology yeah that's true so it sounds
45:03 - like importing a lot of those uh I mean
45:06 - like there are a lot more accessible
45:08 - Fields than programming You could argue
45:10 - that programming is one of the least
45:11 - accessible fields and that you have to
45:13 - have some baseline understanding of like
45:15 - computer science how computers work
45:17 - probably have to some basic
45:18 - understanding of mathematics you you
45:19 - need to understand like a lot of
45:21 - different concepts before you can really
45:23 - even like attempt to program without
45:26 - just being completely
45:27 - you know befuddled and frustrated right
45:30 - uh so whereas if you show somebody like
45:32 - hey here's a cooking tutorial let's
45:34 - crack the eggs let's you know mix them
45:36 - let's add you know a teaspoon of uh yeah
45:40 - that I can't get into that's that's
45:42 - beyond me you know cooking tutorials but
45:44 - but it is like a physical thing like
45:46 - it's a it's a procedure that probably
45:48 - anybody can watch and like if if you put
45:51 - them in some situation where like you're
45:53 - going to go to jail for 10 years unless
45:54 - you can make me an alet right now here
45:56 - the
45:58 - people could probably do like an OM
46:00 - right whereas if you if you gave
46:02 - somebody the same proposition you're
46:04 - going to uh unless you do rot 13 in the
46:07 - next 20 minutes you're going to go to
46:09 - jail for 10 years like they they would
46:10 - probably you know not be able to do that
46:13 - the typical lay person right just
46:15 - because it it is like it's not a dark
46:17 - art programming is something that can be
46:19 - learned obviously like we're teaching
46:21 - millions of people to learn each month
46:23 - through free Cod camp and you're
46:24 - teaching probably at least hundreds of
46:26 - thousands of people how to use these
46:27 - different tools each month um maybe you
46:29 - can talk a little bit
46:32 - about what it is the you're teaching and
46:35 - what has because I look at your YouTube
46:37 - videos um and you've got some very
46:39 - popular videos like 5 million views um
46:42 - on some of your different project videos
46:44 - and most of your most popular videos are
46:46 - around GPT because you rode that wave
46:48 - and you were like one of the first
46:49 - people you were on the ground floor you
46:51 - were already ready you already
46:52 - understood how to wield these tools when
46:54 - suddenly GPT chat GPT kind of kicked off
46:58 - this chain reaction and got everybody
47:00 - talking about Ai and stuff y so it's the
47:04 - question the
47:05 - question what are your videos about like
47:08 - these days like what are the what would
47:10 - you say the main focus uh if people were
47:12 - like going to your YouTube channel like
47:14 - what would they go there to learn
47:16 - primarily and what are you I had the two
47:18 - channels I've got my Adrian Taro Channel
47:21 - and I like to these days think that
47:23 - that's kind of about programming and AI
47:27 - then I've got a second Channel called
47:28 - codex community and that channel is
47:31 - about
47:32 - design no code and a little bit of AI
47:36 - because AI is pretty much everywhere
47:38 - these days but more about design and no
47:40 - code so it kind of one is more about
47:42 - programmers and one is more about those
47:44 - people that don't want to program but
47:45 - they still want to build
47:47 - websites right so you could like there's
47:50 - this term like Technical and
47:52 - non-technical right like so Semite
47:53 - technical people uh who may know a
47:56 - little bit about coding but don't want
47:58 - to spend all day in vs code like wiring
48:00 - things together they might use low code
48:03 - tools or no code tools or AI Tools in
48:05 - order to get things done instead so
48:07 - codex is kind of like catering toward
48:11 - those people whereas like the main
48:12 - Adrian toog channel is like the the
48:15 - super user like the person who does know
48:17 - how to program and also wants to indeed
48:20 - harvest the utility of these tools I
48:22 - guess like the Adrian twarog one is more
48:25 - also personalized cuz it's me working
48:28 - sometimes on Creative projects I like to
48:30 - work on and so that's why like some of
48:33 - my videos are like me building an RPG as
48:35 - a website so rather than having a
48:37 - fitness tracker or a food tracker you
48:40 - have your life covered as an RPG and you
48:43 - can see your strength and endurance and
48:44 - health and stuff like that I just like
48:46 - to see at like how can I make a creative
48:49 - topic or how can I make a programming
48:51 - thing more interesting than it otherwise
48:54 - is rather than just creating a to-do
48:56 - list cuz
48:57 - you know that doesn't really excite me
48:58 - that
48:59 - much yeah those those standard uh
49:02 - projects that people do like portfolio
49:04 - projects um yeah there's always like a
49:06 - to-do list there's usually some sort of
49:08 - like you know currency exchange
49:11 - calculator like um calorie counter you
49:14 - stuff like that that are they're cool
49:15 - good projects to get you started but you
49:17 - could also do something that nobody's
49:19 - ever done before right uh you you could
49:23 - you can follow your Flights of Fancy and
49:25 - create like uh
49:27 - I I don't know like a Pokedex for
49:31 - um for you know K-Pop singers or
49:34 - something like that you know what
49:36 - whatever wherever your passions like
49:37 - overlap you could you could build
49:39 - something in that space and so you built
49:40 - this it's a pretty cool project uh I
49:42 - watched the video last night just to re
49:44 - refresh I'd seen it before but basically
49:46 - you do build an RPG that like tracks
49:49 - different aspects of of your life that
49:51 - you're you're trying to Monitor and
49:53 - improve and kind of gamifies your actual
49:55 - real life and not just Gam like you
49:57 - might use run keeper or straa or one of
50:00 - those tools to like track your runs or
50:01 - something but this is like an
50:03 - all-encompassing like you are the role
50:05 - playing character and you have stats and
50:07 - you want to buff those stats right
50:10 - exactly it's just a different mindset of
50:12 - like how you track your life rather than
50:15 - just like the traditional way you want
50:16 - to gamify it essentially CU everything
50:18 - that's gamified is a little bit more fun
50:20 - these
50:21 - days yeah and I'm going to link to the
50:23 - video in the show notes but uh the funny
50:25 - thing about that video is like it's one
50:27 - of my most popular videos but it doesn't
50:30 - really teach anyone anything there's no
50:32 - programming in there it's more like a
50:34 - storytelling video I bring people along
50:37 - the Journey of me trying to solve how
50:39 - I'm going to build this thing and I kind
50:42 - of give them the summary of the problems
50:45 - I encountered when I was coding it and
50:47 - then just show them the solution so if
50:49 - you want to learn code you're not going
50:51 - to learn anything from that video but if
50:54 - you're going in there to get some
50:55 - motivation some inspiration
50:57 - to have a look at a cool creative idea
50:59 - and even if you want to download the
51:00 - code and build it up yourself you can
51:02 - jump into the description I've put it on
51:03 - GitHub so you can actually run it up
51:05 - yourself so that's the kind of video I
51:08 - like to make a lot of
51:10 - yeah yeah and one of the cool things
51:12 - about that video in a lot of your videos
51:14 - is you don't just start open up vs code
51:16 - all right let's you know get this you
51:18 - know these libraries in place or
51:20 - anything like that no you start with
51:21 - sketching things out um you you are kind
51:24 - of like a designer at least in how you
51:27 - approach different things and of course
51:28 - you've got like mad design chops which
51:31 - we'll talk about a little bit like
51:32 - you've like published an entire book
51:34 - about design uh but uh you like to
51:38 - actually start out with like paper and
51:40 - pencil or in this video you use like an
51:42 - iPad and like one of those apple pencils
51:44 - that cost like 50 bucks I don't know if
51:46 - they're actually worth it but but like
51:48 - you use that thing and you start like
51:49 - drawing out a UI uh and yeah maybe you
51:53 - can talk a little about your workflow
51:54 - when you approach building a project and
51:56 - do you still start that way do you still
51:58 - start with like a blank canvas and start
52:01 - you know hashing out UI details right
52:04 - there with a pen so um funny enough I
52:07 - still use that same iPad and I still use
52:09 - that same pencil apple pencil and so yes
52:12 - I still do it that way it's one of the
52:14 - ways that I like to create like any idea
52:18 - where I actually just sketch it out like
52:20 - what am I trying to solve how can I
52:22 - brainstorm this what are the key
52:24 - elements and then I can kind of map them
52:26 - map out and then when I map them out I
52:28 - like to then visually map them out so
52:29 - rather than creating a design I just
52:31 - sketch it out like little squares and
52:33 - whatnot to like visualize what will this
52:36 - actually look like when it's working and
52:38 - so that kind of makes the whole process
52:40 - of building it a lot easier it's like
52:42 - saying oh the the recent idea I'm
52:44 - building is a Pokédex it's a Pokédex for
52:47 - real life and so you know Pokemon 20
52:51 - years ago had this cool AI thing that
52:54 - you take a photo of any animal and it
52:56 - tells you what it is with an AI
52:58 - generated voice and it just can use
53:00 - vision and it detect what that thing is
53:03 - and now we have chat GPT so like Pokemon
53:05 - already knew about this thing 20 years
53:07 - ago in the Pokédex and now I'm just
53:09 - thinking how can I build my own Pokedex
53:12 - so a pokedex essentially I can break it
53:14 - down into steps like one is you take a
53:16 - photo number two is you send that photo
53:18 - to an AI and it tells you a description
53:20 - of what that item is three you save that
53:23 - photo in the description four you
53:25 - generate a voice or you use an AI voice
53:28 - model to describe what that is in audio
53:31 - form rather than in just text and then
53:33 - five you like save it to a database and
53:36 - so that's kind of like a Pokedex for
53:38 - real life but it's mapping out those
53:40 - steps and then creating visuals for each
53:42 - one of those steps you can break down a
53:45 - complex problem and just make it happen
53:47 - essentially and it's kind of the mindset
53:49 - I bring towards programming I
53:51 - guess yeah and do you use any like
53:53 - formal system like Universal modeling
53:55 - language uml or anything like that when
53:57 - you're like trying to diagram these
53:58 - things out or how do you uh how do you
54:01 - actually like wire everything together
54:04 - in your mind and on paper before you
54:06 - actually start building do you and do
54:07 - you do all that before you actually
54:09 - start building yeah know I I don't know
54:12 - like I I never learned any of these
54:14 - paradigms or these Frameworks so I just
54:16 - I just brainstorm it out and then I just
54:18 - draw it and then I just build it yeah
54:20 - but um visually like that seems to work
54:22 - really well and I can oh I think my
54:24 - camera's going there there we go
54:27 - um okay like from my point of
54:29 - view from working on early concepts of
54:33 - ideas I've had to working in business to
54:35 - now making content on YouTube that's
54:38 - always worked really well the only one
54:40 - thing I haven't done is worked in large
54:42 - teams of like maybe 50 to 100 developers
54:45 - working on like a huge repo I don't know
54:47 - if you would need some sort of um proper
54:49 - Frameworks in mind for that kind of
54:52 - stuff but for the kind of stuff I'm
54:53 - working on it's always worked perfectly
54:55 - fine
54:57 - yeah and
54:58 - so collaborating with teams in my
55:00 - opinion like that is a completely
55:02 - different skill set than just being like
55:03 - a solo developer and like being your own
55:06 - product manager and uh being your own
55:08 - developer your own designer like you the
55:11 - most efficient number of people to have
55:13 - on a team is always going to be one
55:15 - because there's like none of that
55:16 - communication overhead you don't need to
55:18 - formalize everything the way that it can
55:20 - be Community yeah yeah quick and dirty
55:22 - as you said yeah exactly uh so so like
55:27 - people take for granted like how
55:29 - difficult it is to get an entire team on
55:31 - the same page and convey an idea that
55:34 - like the Visionary person on the team
55:36 - who has this vision for the product like
55:38 - but when you're doing things yourself
55:40 - whatever system works for you works for
55:42 - you right like you don't need to feel
55:44 - like oh damn I don't knowl I'm not a
55:46 - real you know developer if I don't
55:49 - knowl uh because I can't actually do all
55:51 - the fancy like squares and stuff like
55:53 - they do in the movies you know um but
55:55 - but the reality is um yeah whatever
55:59 - works works and it sounds like your you
56:01 - know your brutal pragmatism is on Full
56:03 - display in terms of how you kind of mock
56:06 - these projects up y before building them
56:09 - out and um I'd say the same thing
56:11 - happens to a lot of things in real life
56:13 - um so my wife for example start up a
56:16 - nail salon and so you'd normally for a
56:18 - business to get you know a loan from the
56:20 - bank they want like a business plan and
56:22 - all this stuff and we just did it step
56:24 - by step oh my camera's gone again there
56:27 - s yeah don't worry about okay it's back
56:29 - it's out that's mindset that I have
56:32 - where I'm building a application I said
56:35 - let's do the same for the nail salon
56:37 - let's just map up all right we need a
56:38 - location we need nail stock we need you
56:41 - know some equipment to get it up and
56:42 - running and then we just start
56:44 - advertising and getting people to come
56:46 - in and anything along the way we just
56:47 - buy as we need and so we're able to do
56:50 - that and build a nail salon from scratch
56:53 - so um I'd say a lot of things in life
56:56 - even like when I had my son like there
56:58 - is no plan for that sometimes like you
57:01 - have to kind of learn as you go yeah
57:04 - absolutely like there's no book how to
57:06 - be a great parent I'm sure there are
57:08 - tons of books by way I'm sure there are
57:10 - books for it but but like I mean really
57:13 - it's like an experiential thing it's
57:14 - like there's like there is no book I
57:16 - would have learned to code and and get a
57:18 - developer job except there is that I
57:19 - wrote yay um just Google learn to code
57:22 - book but like that's just my opinion man
57:26 - like like yeah correct in practice
57:29 - there's going to be so many different
57:31 - things so many different like things
57:33 - that are specific to your circumstances
57:34 - and everything like that and they're
57:36 - going to be similar like with building a
57:38 - nail salon or building you know a PO
57:41 - pokeddex for real life uh whatever your
57:43 - project may be you know to some extent
57:46 - you have to rely on your instincts and
57:48 - you have to uh just accept that like hey
57:51 - if I was able to accomplish something
57:53 - there is some validity in how I
57:55 - accomplished it even if looking back it
57:57 - seems like I was just flying by the seat
57:58 - of my pants and had no idea what I was
58:00 - doing the proof is in the pudding right
58:03 - like yeah or the proof the proof of the
58:05 - pudding is in the eating right if the if
58:06 - the pudding is edible you must have done
58:08 - something right right it's not like
58:10 - radioactive you know sludge that is like
58:12 - making people throw up and stuff it's
58:14 - pudding right so you know you kind of
58:17 - have to feel through but but I just want
58:18 - to say like love yourself love respect
58:22 - yourself respect what you've
58:23 - accomplished and don't feel like oh I'm
58:25 - just like a dirty hack who just like you
58:28 - know slaps things together with no Grace
58:30 - or Elegance um you know you'd be amazed
58:34 - at how many of the projects out there
58:36 - are kind of tacked together like
58:38 - famously since we talked about Microsoft
58:40 - and Doss earlier okay yeah have you ever
58:43 - uh have you ever wondered why they jump
58:45 - straight from Windows 8 to Windows 10
58:49 - and why there's no Windows
58:50 - 9 um I thought nine just didn't seem
58:54 - like a good number so they skipped it
58:57 - what I heard was because they had like
59:00 - Windows 95 Windows 98 Windows you know
59:03 - they had like all these different parts
59:05 - of the Microsoft codebase referenced
59:07 - Windows 95 because they didn't imagine
59:09 - like oh we'll just do a full rewrite
59:11 - when we create some future version but
59:12 - no they just keep piling more and more
59:14 - code so if you use like Windows 11 it
59:16 - probably has a whole lot of Windows 95
59:17 - code in there uh that's what I've heard
59:19 - I haven't actually inspected the code
59:20 - base and I don't think it's open source
59:22 - so I don't think I can maybe they've
59:23 - open sourced some of the old versions
59:25 - but um
59:27 - they didn't want to risk having
59:29 - references to Windows 9x because they
59:32 - might have used like regular expressions
59:33 - or any number of things and it would
59:35 - just add all this complexity so like hey
59:37 - I have an idea let's just skip to
59:38 - Windows 10 and uh maybe people won't
59:41 - notice that we skip Windows 9 because we
59:43 - don't want to spend you know developer
59:45 - years hunting through this massive
59:47 - codebase trying to identify all the
59:49 - situations where having a Windows 9
59:51 - could clash with Windows 95 or Windows
59:53 - 98 you know so yeah remember that they
59:56 - said they would yeah I remember they
59:59 - said they would never stop after like
60:00 - they would stop after 10 and there would
60:02 - just be updates after that but then
60:04 - there was 11 and yeah you know but
60:06 - you're right like I think sometimes you
60:08 - don't know what's happening behind the
60:09 - scenes and some things are made with
60:11 - duct tape and sticky tape but they're
60:14 - held together and they somehow work and
60:16 - on the front end everything looks
60:18 - pretty exactly yeah nobody get nobody
60:21 - goes and sees what like how the sausage
60:23 - is made so to speak they just see the uh
60:25 - result in you know if you're not a
60:28 - vegetarian the resulting sauce is just
60:30 - you know very delicious right so
60:32 - um yeah it sounds like to some extent
60:35 - you're just you and your wife are just
60:37 - feeling your way through building this
60:39 - nail salon and you similarly are feeling
60:41 - your way through becoming a prominent
60:43 - YouTube Creator uh becoming a developer
60:47 - uh I mean it sounds like your first day
60:48 - is on the job you know where you were
60:50 - like using all these tools and figuring
60:52 - out all these new things and you know
60:54 - bringing your your own curiosity to the
60:56 - Forefront and applying it to find
60:58 - inventive ways of Saving Time and
60:59 - getting things done faster it sounds
61:01 - like that that you you I mean the vibe I
61:04 - get from you is that you're just you're
61:05 - unashamed of the
61:07 - hackness yeah no I'm not I I think it's
61:11 - part of the process that a lot of people
61:12 - need to see that you know things aren't
61:15 - written perfectly in code every single
61:17 - time and those early videos I did had
61:19 - old the mistakes and how I problem solve
61:21 - those mistakes along the way as well and
61:24 - so I think that was an important an part
61:26 - of it then on top of that I don't think
61:28 - I've ever personally had impostor
61:31 - syndrome cuz I suppose I started at the
61:34 - very bottom and I just I assumed I don't
61:37 - know anything and so I very upfront that
61:40 - I don't know anything and then even when
61:41 - I'm teaching Concepts it's me not
61:44 - knowing about something and discovering
61:45 - it and showing that journey and so for
61:47 - me it's always been a very natural part
61:50 - of how I present I
61:52 - guess yeah and I am similar and that I
61:56 - did have some imposter syndrome but I
61:58 - just assumed like I knew nothing and
62:00 - that like I'm you know some 30-year-old
62:02 - guy who's waiting into this field that
62:04 - people have already been coding for like
62:06 - 20 years because they started when they
62:07 - were kids and they were in like high
62:09 - school programming club and Robotics
62:11 - club and stuff like that and uh I just
62:13 - assumed that I was surrounded by people
62:14 - that were more experienced more capable
62:16 - than me and like okay let's take as a
62:19 - given that those people are you know
62:21 - more capable than me what can I do is
62:23 - there still a place for me to get things
62:25 - done and so you know just finding things
62:27 - that I can practically do to help yeah
62:30 - so I have a lot of questions that we
62:32 - haven't even gotten to because we've had
62:35 - so many exciting things to talk about uh
62:38 - you you have like of course uh you know
62:41 - your YouTube channels um code code x x
62:46 - yeah like codex like a like a book as
62:48 - opposed to a scroll a book that has like
62:50 - binding early open AI model for coding
62:53 - codex yeah oh okay so
62:56 - um one of the things you do is you are
62:59 - an AI evangelist which sounds like
63:01 - almost like an apocalyptic role maybe
63:04 - you can talk about what you do as an AI
63:06 - evangelist um I'd say it's less about um
63:11 - playing around with all the AI tools and
63:13 - more just thinking like what Cool Tools
63:15 - should devs know about like what are
63:17 - cool AI things that are going to make
63:20 - your life a bit easier if you're coding
63:22 - if you're making websites if you're
63:23 - designing because it's kind of like
63:27 - suddenly a year skipped by and there's
63:30 - dozens and dozens of new tools out there
63:33 - that compete with Adobe and figma and
63:36 - they compete with Photoshop to generate
63:38 - stuff that wasn't capable like the most
63:40 - recent one I've seen and um I can't
63:43 - really say it'll help developers but it
63:45 - helps me is like there's music
63:47 - generation with AI now and these songs
63:50 - that it generates means that I don't
63:51 - have to worry about you know um having
63:54 - copyright music or anything it's a
63:55 - beautiful song made in two seconds from
63:58 - a single prompt in two seconds you get
64:01 - anything you want you if you want like
64:03 - instrumentals if you want Loi if you
64:06 - want um synth it's all there and you
64:08 - just describe what you want like I want
64:11 - um a song about the Roman Empire and you
64:14 - can even have lyrics in there and the
64:15 - lyrics sound like a real person you can
64:17 - even specify what the lyrics say and it
64:19 - turns it into the song so it's it's
64:22 - amazing and that's just like one tool
64:25 - out of many
64:26 - my friend sent me one of those the other
64:27 - day it was like taking about using the
64:29 - restroom on the clock it wasn't exactly
64:32 - like that but like the best 45 minutes
64:34 - of my life you know like getting paid to
64:38 - use the restroom basically and I'm not
64:40 - saying exactly what the lyrics are very
64:42 - crass song but uh yeah it was I I was
64:46 - like wow like did a human really not
64:48 - play a part in writing the lyrics of
64:50 - this I mean you could tell there was
64:51 - artifacts and if you're a musician you
64:53 - can listen and you can be like okay like
64:55 - this is like the most generic you know
64:57 - chord progression or this is like the
64:59 - most generic like drum Tempo or it
65:01 - sounds like they it's just like you
65:02 - threw a bunch of stuff in a blender it
65:04 - doesn't seem original but it is
65:06 - technically original in the way that
65:08 - like a string of text coming from GPT
65:10 - technically if you plug that into Google
65:12 - uh it's extremely improbable that that
65:14 - exact sentence will have occurred before
65:16 - even though you know it's trained on you
65:19 - know but I could see as a Creator just
65:21 - not wanting to worry about copyright
65:22 - strikes that was a huge headache uh
65:24 - anytime you're using any sort of
65:25 - recorded music unless you're doing a
65:27 - Channel about music where you need to
65:28 - like actually use excerpts from music to
65:30 - talk about it uh which should be fair
65:32 - use but even like Rick biato and a lot
65:34 - of the big uh YouTube creators that are
65:35 - in the music space complained about like
65:38 - let Zeppelin I can't even play the the
65:40 - first three notes
65:41 - from cop yeah it's crazy but um it it is
65:46 - a thing and so now ai is coming and
65:49 - solving a lot of problems like even
65:51 - there's an AI website called reloom Ai
65:54 - and what it does is it makes wireframes
65:57 - using Ai and all you do is type in a
65:59 - prompt I I want a website for a nail
66:01 - salon and it creates all the wireframes
66:04 - it creates all the text and sometimes it
66:06 - can even do the visuals for you and it
66:07 - takes like 5 Seconds to create you the
66:09 - concept out for different websites and
66:11 - you can regenerate them so like they're
66:13 - just making the process of building a
66:15 - website a lot
66:17 - faster yeah and um what are some of the
66:22 - other types of AI tools you use and and
66:24 - I do want to get more into like your
66:25 - formal job as an AI like that's on your
66:27 - LinkedIn AI evangelist like is it I
66:30 - didn't even know that I think so I mean
66:33 - I just looked at your LinkedIn a minute
66:34 - ago and I saw that it like jumped out of
66:37 - me you been like I didn't even know yeah
66:41 - yeah well it's it's not your job to like
66:43 - stay on top of LinkedIn when you're m
66:45 - mostly it sounds like you're just
66:46 - working on your
66:47 - own yeah working with like uh you do
66:50 - sponsorships and stuff with uh one um so
66:54 - that Ai and uh version you're talking
66:56 - about was there's a company in West
66:58 - Australia that does um they're called
67:01 - generative and um they do AI project so
67:05 - as I was getting requests for Consulting
67:07 - in AI I would forward them on to these
67:10 - guys ah okay so basically like people
67:14 - come to you all the time probably asking
67:16 - you about AI I had hundreds of emails
67:19 - yeah it was insane especially you
67:21 - basically just like help kind of triage
67:23 - those and steer those to people that
67:25 - actually do contract work in the space
67:27 - correct yes okay that that makes sense
67:30 - so that was what I was referring to when
67:32 - I said AI it's literally originally I I
67:35 - didn't know where to send people and you
67:37 - know that like you don't want to
67:38 - recommend someone when you don't know if
67:40 - that company is any good um you want to
67:42 - actually like meet a few people and
67:44 - actually recommend someone who you trust
67:46 - and know will do the thing properly so
67:47 - like in this case I finally found
67:49 - someone in Australia that does it and so
67:51 - that's why I've been recommending people
67:52 - to that company yeah so that that is
67:55 - like a a heartening note if for any of
67:57 - you out there listening that are really
67:59 - interested in like a specific kind of
68:02 - vertical of technology or something like
68:03 - that eventually you may become so
68:06 - authoritative in that space that you're
68:07 - turning away work and you can get paid
68:09 - to send that work to somebody else who
68:11 - actually has the bandwidth to do that
68:12 - work um yeah it sounds like an enviable
68:15 - position that you've uh established for
68:17 - yourself so um you in addition to being
68:21 - like the the AI guy the low code guy um
68:24 - on YouTube like the one of the serious
68:26 - creators in the space who has a computer
68:28 - science degree and has worked as a
68:30 - developer and as an IT guy for like you
68:32 - know nearly two decades it sounds like
68:34 - like you're somebody who actually uh you
68:38 - know has built out that expertise and
68:40 - that reputation over the years um but in
68:42 - addition to that you also have as I said
68:45 - earlier like serious design skills um
68:48 - and you you've created like a web design
68:51 - road map for example can you talk about
68:53 - your relationship with design yeah sure
68:56 - um when I was doing a lot of the
68:59 - websites to begin with um obviously I
69:02 - didn't have a designer so I had to
69:03 - design them myself so while I was
69:05 - staying ahead of all the programming
69:07 - stuff that was happening I was always
69:08 - staying ahead with all the design stuff
69:10 - that was happening because I was just
69:11 - designing my own ideas so I was always
69:14 - very ahead of the bleeding edge almost
69:16 - of
69:17 - design and over time I learned all the
69:20 - concepts that make a good website look
69:22 - good I was always having a look at like
69:24 - redesigned Concepts for like Facebook or
69:26 - Google or Reddit even and making my own
69:28 - variations on that just as a hobby and
69:31 - over time when I did my YouTube channel
69:34 - I thought well why not like I I started
69:36 - my YouTube channel doing like just
69:38 - websites doing some basic HTML then I
69:41 - grew it out to like other things in
69:43 - programming to react and node and then I
69:45 - thought why not grow it out to design as
69:47 - well but I noticed YouTube punished me
69:49 - when I created content for programming
69:51 - and design cuz they're almost two
69:53 - completely different subjects it's why I
69:55 - created that separate Channel called
69:57 - codex for design and kept programming
69:59 - separate on um on my Adan TW Channel but
70:02 - I did like in um teaching those Design
70:05 - Concepts and I never had any courses or
70:07 - anything like that and I S thought to
70:09 - myself one of the best things I can do
70:11 - is create a course for design so I have
70:14 - my own course that people can learn
70:16 - these fundamentals what especially
70:18 - developers who never learn any design so
70:20 - I made a course called um enhance UI or
70:23 - teach me um design which was
70:25 - specifically designed for developers
70:28 - coming in because I knew the developer
70:29 - mindset I thought I would go through all
70:31 - those fundamentals of like topography
70:33 - and color theory and stuff that I
70:35 - learned over the years but more in a
70:37 - Programming type fashion so I started
70:40 - doing this course and I thought it would
70:41 - take me like a month to do then I
70:43 - thought it would take me half a year to
70:44 - do then I thought it would take me a
70:46 - year to do and I continued to make it
70:48 - and make it and make it and then I
70:49 - teamed up with a guy called George um
70:51 - and we continued to build it and end up
70:53 - being like over 400 pages is long
70:55 - because there's obviously just so many
70:57 - concepts for design but I ended up
70:59 - releasing it almost a year and a half
71:01 - down the track and design is luckily one
71:04 - of those things that never changes like
71:06 - color theory has been around for 100
71:08 - years good topography will never change
71:10 - while different fonts will be popular
71:12 - the fundamentals for that will always be
71:14 - the same I thought if I do it properly
71:16 - and do it once well it'll always be
71:19 - there so unlike react or nextjs every
71:21 - year there's a new version you have to
71:22 - relearn the course or something like
71:24 - that even JavaScript new modules out
71:26 - there design is one of those things that
71:29 - I can make it right the first time and
71:32 - everyone will benefit forever
71:34 - essentially if you learn that course
71:35 - it'll benefit forever into the future
71:37 - from doing it and so I built that course
71:39 - it's called enhance UI um if you go to
71:42 - enhance ui.com right now you can visit
71:44 - it and um and yeah it's doing really
71:47 - well I did like a um I also did a video
71:50 - on every single chapter of that book um
71:53 - so it's like a full on book full on
71:55 - video video course and now I've got
71:56 - exercises and workshops in there and I'm
71:59 - continuously building it out and
72:00 - improving it every year now that I've
72:02 - got it
72:04 - out yeah it's really cool that you it's
72:07 - like a living document and there's like
72:09 - a community around it uh you you have a
72:11 - Discord for it that people join so yeah
72:13 - I've created a Discord I've called that
72:15 - um Discord merge um and I just thought I
72:18 - need to have a different name from codex
72:21 - so I'm slowly creating a new channel
72:22 - called merge as well um on YouTube I
72:25 - third Channel um cuz merge sounds more
72:27 - like a um a thing where I'm talking
72:30 - about design because you're merging code
72:31 - with design so that was my mindset
72:33 - behind it um and yeah if you had to
72:36 - merge I've got a huge community on there
72:38 - and what I do is also I do free design
72:40 - reviews so if you have a website I
72:41 - review it I go over like what you can do
72:43 - to improve it um I'm sharing all these
72:46 - things like the AI tools about how you
72:47 - can create wireframe designs um so
72:51 - that's kind of like the the mindset
72:52 - behind that Community anyway
72:55 - yeah and uh I think it's so cool that
72:57 - you're like so committed to this field
73:00 - of design that you just kind of stumbled
73:02 - into as a developer like as you said you
73:04 - just had to kind of like learn this
73:05 - stuff to in order to be able to do a
73:07 - better job as a developer working on
73:10 - different contracts you know uh
73:11 - obviously like the usability and things
73:13 - like that uh are are important in the
73:16 - functionality but what it looks like the
73:18 - actual Aesthetics are important and you
73:21 - know people care about Aesthetics and
73:24 - what is a Aesthetics what is good
73:26 - typography what is you know like design
73:29 - hierarchy what are a lot of these
73:30 - different concepts well a lot of that
73:32 - stuff was cemented in the kind of like
73:34 - advertising age of like the you know 30s
73:36 - 40s 50s 60s if you've seen Mad Men like
73:39 - one of my favorite shows of all time
73:40 - like they're they're just constantly
73:42 - talking about these things and they're
73:43 - like steeped in that culture of uh what
73:46 - is going to catch the eye what's going
73:47 - to hold attention what's going to be
73:49 - legible if you read uh there's a book uh
73:52 - gosh who is the guy that the big
73:53 - Advertiser guy that uh Ogie Ogie on Ogie
73:58 - his book and he talks about how like
74:00 - they have like this ad for like
74:02 - Volkswagen bug that they've used for
74:04 - like 30 years and they never changed it
74:05 - because it just it works it converts
74:07 - like and why does it work you know and
74:09 - and like trying to understand strip that
74:11 - down to the nuts and bolts and
74:12 - understand the actual design
74:14 - considerations um so just like with like
74:17 - free C Camp and Mathematics where huge
74:19 - Advocates of learning mathematics and
74:21 - Mathematics doesn't really change it's
74:23 - been like more or less the same for the
74:25 - last 2,000 years and then people have
74:26 - layered some additional stuff on it it's
74:28 - one of those skills that if you like
74:30 - really learn it properly you don't have
74:32 - to keep coming back to it right uh you
74:34 - could you just for the rest of your life
74:35 - you have that toolbox for uh you know
74:39 - understanding what is good design and
74:41 - being able to create things on the Fly
74:43 - and being able to recognize good design
74:45 - in other things uh so this this sounds
74:48 - like a really cool book and and a really
74:50 - cool course yeah um and a while back you
74:54 - sent me like a book that was like one of
74:55 - the most beautiful I guess
74:57 - self-published books like it I'd never
75:00 - seen a book where every page looked so
75:04 - you know deliberated upon uh yeah can
75:07 - you tell me a little bit about that book
75:08 - is that the same book yeah it is it's um
75:11 - originally I got inspired by someone
75:13 - called um Chris doe he runs a channel
75:15 - called the future it's a Design Channel
75:18 - and so he wrote a book and it was just
75:20 - like his own kind of personal book about
75:24 - himself but what he did in that book was
75:26 - every page on its opposite side had a
75:29 - beautiful visual he had created in his
75:32 - you know life and it was like a design
75:35 - image and so I thought if I'm going to
75:37 - create this book for developers and I
75:40 - want to teach a a concept about color
75:42 - theory how about I create a beautiful
75:44 - visual for every single one of these
75:46 - Pages it's one of the reason the book is
75:48 - like 400 Pages um plus it's because 200
75:51 - pages is the content and the other 200
75:55 - pages are the beautiful visuals that
75:57 - explain or represent that Visual and so
76:00 - if you've ever followed uh George mher
76:02 - on Twitter you might have also seen he's
76:04 - done a lot of those visuals as well on
76:06 - like things like react and stuff if you
76:07 - can visually show someone like a folder
76:10 - structure in a beautiful way it's a lot
76:12 - more appealing than if you just see a
76:15 - snapshot of vs code and so that's the
76:16 - mindset I brought into creating the book
76:19 - so that I wanted the experience of
76:21 - reading it to be almost like a very nice
76:23 - one I've got like motiv quotes in there
76:26 - from aspiring artists to like beautiful
76:29 - visuals that represent um things like
76:31 - the topography itself so that you can
76:33 - see as well as read the
76:36 - content yeah yeah that's so cool and I'm
76:40 - just curious like how much time does it
76:42 - take like what tools do you use to lay
76:43 - that out by the way you so I actually
76:46 - got the proper in design from Adobe and
76:48 - I build that up properly as a published
76:51 - book that can be then later on printed
76:53 - and I've done a dark version
76:55 - and a light version I just haven't gone
76:57 - through the process of seeing if I can
76:59 - get it printed on Amazon yet but that is
77:00 - like one of the steps I want to do in
77:02 - the future too yeah I mean you you can
77:05 - basically take any book and put it on
77:07 - Amazon and they can print it now whether
77:08 - it's going to be like this fancy bound
77:11 - kind of like coffee table book like
77:13 - there are books that cost 50 bucks 100
77:16 - bucks right like Getty Lee put out a
77:18 - book about the electric bass right and I
77:22 - was like oh man that'd be amazing but
77:23 - I'm not spending like I don't know much
77:25 - the book is it's like 100 bucks Getty
77:27 - Lee book base if you don't know who
77:30 - Getty Lee is he's the uh the Bas player
77:33 - for Rush and he's yeah it's it's a $50
77:37 - Hefty book probably weigh several pounds
77:39 - I may get one I may get a copy I love
77:41 - bass um but like if if you wanted to
77:43 - print like an actual like thick uh 400
77:47 - page like nice paper quality book that's
77:50 - going to sit on somebody's coffee table
77:51 - or going to sit on a bookshelf behind
77:54 - somebody like me me wink nudge nudge
77:56 - wink wink if you do print one and you
77:57 - ship it to me I will put it on the the
77:59 - bookshelf behind me I've been looking
78:00 - for good books to put on there
78:02 - um you may need to go to a special
78:05 - publisher for that uh or you may be able
78:07 - to do like I don't know if anybody still
78:08 - does kickstarters but something like
78:10 - that to to get the publication of it uh
78:12 - but I'd be very interested in having a
78:15 - physical copy at some point um and I
78:17 - think a lot of people listening for this
78:19 - would be too because I love design and
78:21 - I've spent so much time at bookstores
78:24 - just flipping through different books on
78:26 - like Design Concepts and things like
78:27 - that that are just very beautifully
78:30 - crafted and uh like a lot of times
78:32 - they'll be like really weird shapes like
78:33 - they'll be really giant or really small
78:36 - and you like flip through them and they
78:37 - find all these creative ways to
78:38 - illustrate the different concepts and
78:40 - and I had lots of friends uh when I was
78:42 - in college who were designers as well so
78:45 - like yeah it's it's a field of personal
78:46 - interest for me even though like if you
78:48 - look at free C Camp we have like an
78:50 - extremely like almost brutalist if
78:52 - you're familiar with like the brutalist
78:54 - movement of Architecture is like bare
78:56 - concrete you know like it it's free C
78:59 - Camp is very much uh simple and like we
79:03 - don't we don't do anything fancy like we
79:05 - we just like exactly what you know uh
79:08 - inspired by that kind of pragmatic like
79:10 - practical like we I I call it command
79:13 - line
79:14 - Chic uh because I was trying to like
79:17 - recreate the feel of being in a command
79:19 - line like uh maybe like MS DOS era
79:22 - whenever you're like doing a Bo or
79:24 - something I said let's let's redesign
79:26 - your website cuz I could make it you
79:27 - know look good but you're like you like
79:30 - it to be that brutalist style cuz I've
79:33 - actually redone um like I've even done
79:35 - Jesse or code stacker like a design
79:37 - course on sorry no I think he has a vs
79:39 - course super code superhero like I've
79:42 - done a few designs for for a couple of
79:45 - the creators but uh if you ever want a
79:47 - free code C freesign you should do a
79:49 - course like like let's redesign free
79:51 - Coke camp like maybe we can incorporate
79:53 - some of the ideas uh yeah like a lot of
79:55 - the the reason free C Camp looks the way
79:57 - it is is because we have a lot of people
79:59 - accessing us with like very limited data
80:01 - everything has to be really high
80:02 - performance we we use very few images um
80:05 - but here's where like you use a little
80:07 - bit of smarts of like can we do a super
80:09 - fast speed test on their connection
80:11 - within the very first 2 point seconds of
80:14 - the um load and if it's a slow
80:16 - connection you give them a l slow lowy
80:19 - version of the website if they got B
80:21 - connection bu so those are that's how I
80:24 - think I'm like how can I revent this to
80:26 - give them that and you you find that
80:28 - that's what the news websites do right
80:30 - they actually have a low-fi and a high-f
80:32 - five version and the LOI is actually for
80:34 - their SEO so when Google and crawlers
80:36 - hit their website they get a very fast
80:38 - Snappy website with have all the article
80:40 - you go on there and you have a 100
80:42 - videos and ads everywhere and you can't
80:44 - even read the article so it's like how
80:46 - how are they even indexing it so yeah
80:48 - there's tricks around that interesting
80:50 - yeah I had even thought about that but
80:52 - yeah if you because everything you do is
80:54 - like slightly adding to the time but if
80:55 - you can do it fast enough everybody can
80:57 - have a decent experience and and people
80:59 - who have you know I've got like 500
81:02 - megabits here in Texas like we're we're
81:05 - spoiled here in the United States and so
81:07 - I could easily go to like the most
81:08 - multimedia intensive website and I
81:10 - probably wouldn't even notice the load
81:11 - time uh and I I imagine a lot of people
81:14 - listening are in like South Korea or
81:16 - some place like that that has
81:17 - ridiculously fast internet too um okay
81:20 - so uh I am really interested in talking
81:24 - about the the pandemic a little bit just
81:26 - because you made such heavy use of that
81:29 - uh what were some things that you did to
81:32 - really capitalize on the fact that so
81:34 - many people are getting online all at
81:36 - the same time like Freo camp we
81:38 - experienced a dramatic surge in usage
81:41 - which unfortunately it's kind of like
81:41 - tapered off because you know people uh a
81:44 - lot of people uh their ambition was
81:47 - bigger their eyes were bigger than their
81:49 - stomach and once they actually started
81:50 - coding and like getting into it they're
81:51 - like I can't do this for the rest of my
81:52 - life uh but a lot of people state of
81:54 - course so like I think most websites I
81:57 - know like learning websites and then
81:59 - down but like the Baseline is like twice
82:01 - as high as it was before the pandemic
82:03 - maybe you can talk about uh yeah what
82:06 - yeah um what you did I didn't
82:09 - particularly tackle the pandemic from a
82:11 - business point of view to like get the
82:13 - YouTube channel working really well I
82:15 - think at that point in time was when I
82:17 - started YouTube and I saw some small guy
82:20 - called Flor and Pop um and he he
82:24 - published this blog saying that he's
82:25 - going to make 30 videos in 30 days and
82:27 - I'm like that's easy I'll make 300 video
82:31 - or 365 videos in a year and so that's
82:34 - where I had that idea to to make a video
82:37 - every single day and while I didn't make
82:39 - 365 videos I think 300 is a pretty good
82:42 - success rate um for videos in the year
82:45 - and I suppose that was the mindset I
82:47 - went into it like I I kind of treated it
82:49 - as as as a challenge but whether I got
82:52 - subscribers or not wasn't the goal my
82:53 - goal was like can I make a better video
82:55 - than what's online right now and that's
82:58 - a good goal because that's measurable
82:59 - you can't control how many people
83:00 - subscribe to your video like I see
83:02 - people all the time make the mistake
83:03 - like I'm just going to get to a thousand
83:06 - followers on like Instagram or on on
83:08 - YouTube or wherever and they make the
83:10 - goal some sort of number that's
83:11 - completely outside of their control but
83:13 - what you did is you like every video is
83:15 - going to be 1% better and that's
83:16 - subjective but like you did have the
83:18 - concrete goal of I'm going to publish a
83:20 - video every day for 300 days that is
83:22 - something control that I contr control
83:25 - making a good video I couldn't control
83:27 - if it gets views or subscribers and that
83:29 - didn't matter to me at all yeah so to
83:32 - some extent it was just like brute
83:34 - forcing your way to Brilliance like
83:36 - spending a lot of time and energy yeah
83:38 - creating videos and and that process was
83:41 - where you were honed so to speak correct
83:45 - so let's say hypothetically somebody was
83:47 - starting today knowing what you know
83:49 - today if you had like zero we presence
83:51 - and maybe you didn't even have the
83:52 - skills that you have currently would you
83:54 - do the same thing would you just dive in
83:56 - and just start building would and if you
83:57 - have a look at like one of the popular
83:59 - people out there Josh tried coding
84:02 - that's what he did and if you have a
84:03 - look he's having a lot of success but if
84:05 - you watch his early videos that's quite
84:07 - him learning how to code and then
84:10 - sharing what he's learned step by step
84:13 - by step and while it was very raw at the
84:16 - beginning you can see his improvement
84:18 - over time and it's very personal and
84:20 - very
84:21 - genuine yeah so um one of the things
84:25 - that you've said that uh is that even
84:28 - with AI tools you still need to know the
84:31 - fundamentals uh that that like you know
84:34 - tooling is never a replacement for
84:36 - actual comprehension of what's going on
84:37 - under the hood and like being a
84:41 - fundamentals what are the fundamentals
84:43 - that you would encourage web developers
84:45 - to learn in
84:46 - 2024 I think and this is what I
84:48 - recommend still to anyone who ask me
84:51 - they want to start coding I actually do
84:52 - Point them to a free code count and I
84:54 - say learn the responsive web design
84:56 - course where you learn HTML CSS in
84:58 - JavaScript because that is the best um
85:01 - way to enter into learning to code it's
85:03 - got like really good tests and examples
85:05 - and it really teaches you that kind of
85:07 - stuff so like I think that's one of the
85:10 - like the the easiest most like there
85:12 - isn't a pay wall behind it either so yes
85:15 - I funny enough you have put together a
85:17 - really good resource for that one yeah
85:20 - uh so so is there any like other big
85:23 - skills like would you consider design a
85:25 - skill that's got to have or would you
85:27 - consider like a i' Sayce to design is
85:30 - something you can look at after you
85:32 - start building websites once you're in
85:33 - there and you're building content um for
85:36 - yourself or for companies then you can
85:37 - start looking at design so I wouldn't
85:39 - say oh do my design calls first and then
85:41 - learn to code because that's not going
85:42 - to serve you as well learning to code
85:45 - will probably serve you really well if
85:47 - that's what you want to do obviously if
85:49 - you don't want to be a coder and you
85:50 - just want to learn design do my design
85:52 - course of course yeah awesome and let's
85:55 - talk about low code and no code so a lot
85:57 - of people a lot of developers especially
85:59 - are like ah they Gran every time you
86:01 - they hear low code or no code just like
86:03 - people might have grown when they heard
86:04 - Microsoft front page when they were
86:06 - building their own websites uh back in
86:08 - or Dream Weaver or something like that
86:09 - that like tries to simplify this you
86:12 - know more like high touch uh process of
86:16 - artisanally crafting a website rather
86:18 - than just you know throwing a bunch of
86:20 - templates together right um how would
86:22 - you describe no code how is it different
86:24 - from low code and then like maybe give
86:27 - me like an idea of for whom those are
86:32 - useful so I would hope that most people
86:35 - that are developers have used figma
86:38 - before because often developers and
86:40 - programmers are converting figma designs
86:42 - into code and figma is a full design
86:45 - piece of software it's almost like
86:47 - Photoshop and I think no code is getting
86:51 - to the point where you can drag and drop
86:54 - and create a visual
86:57 - design and it's already coded that's B
87:00 - basically it you don't have to worry
87:01 - about writing any boxes you don't have
87:03 - to worry about any alignment you just
87:05 - drag it into place and it's right there
87:07 - and I've seen the Stepping Stones of
87:10 - these where like originally you could
87:12 - drag an element um in um with Elementor
87:16 - or weo and then you still have to code
87:18 - out like the padding and everything like
87:19 - that you have to understand those
87:21 - principles of like how HTML works and
87:24 - how sections work and how divs work and
87:26 - it's slowly move like the no code
87:28 - movement is slowly moving away to that
87:30 - to quite literally you do not have to
87:32 - know what's happening under the hood you
87:33 - just drag the elements into how you want
87:36 - them to look and it just it just
87:38 - works so that's what I find really
87:40 - interesting because I wonder like how
87:41 - much coding will be involved in the
87:43 - future besides building the
87:46 - functionality under the hood and this is
87:48 - where like the low code no code will be
87:51 - like visuals are built by designers and
87:53 - then fun functionality built is built by
87:56 - programmers and there's almost going to
87:57 - be a separation between the two at some
87:59 - stage I
88:00 - think interesting so you think that like
88:03 - right now like a lot of web developers
88:04 - do their own design work as well but you
88:07 - do think that things are going to become
88:08 - more Specialized or do you think that
88:10 - like low code tools will allow a
88:12 - mediocre designer to do design work so
88:16 - they can focus on the development work
88:17 - and vice versa for like a mediocre
88:19 - developer I do think that program focus
88:22 - on yeah I do think that programmers and
88:25 - designers will be using no code tools in
88:26 - the future for any marketing company or
88:29 - um web company because it's just easier
88:32 - faster and um better in all manner like
88:36 - you can build a where I used to build
88:38 - websites in two weeks down to like a
88:40 - week down to four days you can use no
88:42 - code to do that in four hours so if it
88:45 - it takes you four hours and you have a
88:46 - website that's secure and looks exactly
88:48 - the same and it's responsive and now you
88:51 - can update it in seconds rather than
88:53 - hours it's a no-brainer for any business
88:56 - in that point of view right and so
88:59 - that's where like a lot of the industry
89:01 - for business is moving that way so if
89:03 - you want to do that of course there's
89:05 - still functionality in businesses that
89:06 - build applications that integrate with
89:08 - AI or do different things with cameras
89:11 - or whatever it is and so for that
89:13 - programmers need to understand the
89:14 - fundamentals you can't particularly have
89:16 - no code tools jump in that easily you
89:19 - usually have to build web web apps and
89:21 - that's where a lot of the programmers
89:22 - will probably be going in that that
89:25 - regard yeah yeah that's definitely like
89:27 - uh I've seen a lot of programmers who
89:30 - are resistant to using those tools
89:32 - almost like like John Henry like I can
89:34 - drive spikes faster than this damn
89:36 - machine you know like that kind of like
89:38 - mentality but at the same time like a
89:40 - lot of them are like well I I use it for
89:42 - this or I use it for that and the number
89:43 - of things they use it for may be slowly
89:45 - growing and it's not necessarily going
89:47 - to replace that developer instinct or
89:49 - the designer eye or things like that but
89:51 - it does you know provide additional
89:54 - leverage so that you can use what you
89:56 - know and your your expertise to get
89:57 - things done faster right I like to think
90:00 - of it as farming right a farmer might go
90:03 - to you and say I can use my hands to
90:05 - scoop out a hole and put a seed in there
90:07 - and pack the Earth in perfectly so why I
90:10 - not always use my hands the next farmer
90:12 - might go oh I have a tool to plow and
90:14 - then a tool to like throw the seeds in
90:16 - there and a tool to compress it so why
90:18 - not use those tools then the next farmer
90:20 - might go I have a machine that does a
90:22 - thousand of these and the seeds for a
90:25 - thousand things and does the um
90:26 - articulations for a thousand of these
90:28 - and then the next farmer goes well I
90:30 - have an AI that does an entire acre for
90:32 - me and all I click is start and it does
90:35 - all the seeding all the watering and
90:37 - everything so at each stage a farmer
90:39 - still needs to understand the um
90:41 - fundamentals but it doesn't mean that
90:43 - the farmer who's manually digging out
90:45 - the soil and putting one seed in there
90:47 - is doing it any better or worse it just
90:48 - means the tools now are kind of Greater
90:52 - and if you want to use ize them sure you
90:55 - can you might have more success and from
90:56 - a business point of view it makes sense
90:59 - but it doesn't take away from the fact
91:00 - that you know how to do that
91:02 - either
91:04 - yeah let's talk about AI tools because
91:07 - sure obviously you're an AI evangelist
91:10 - and you know a lot about AI tooling and
91:12 - you've been working with these since
91:14 - before before it was cool right uh back
91:17 - when you were like one of the few people
91:18 - who who cared to use these you know at
91:21 - the time very limited tools um what AI
91:24 - tools do you use kind of like currently
91:28 - like uh can you maybe rattle off some
91:30 - tools that you use maybe every week I
91:32 - think my dayto day the most I use is
91:35 - obviously GitHub co-pilot it allows me
91:38 - to autocomplete any programming code
91:41 - that I'm trying to figure out which is
91:44 - it's useful it's very
91:46 - useful I do use chat GPT for uh
91:50 - brainstorming so if I have like
91:52 - questions or I'm trying to
91:54 - almost treated like a psychologist where
91:56 - I'm trying to figure out what I'm trying
91:58 - to say or do it helps me kind of
92:01 - brainstorm in that
92:03 - regard um and then I also use um I have
92:08 - 11 Labs it's not really programming but
92:11 - it replicates my voice to such a degree
92:13 - that people can't recognize when I use
92:15 - the AI voice in my own voice and
92:18 - sometimes in videos or in content I can
92:20 - just use that right up a script and
92:22 - suddenly I've already said the script
92:24 - which is great yeah and I've talked with
92:27 - like Andrew Brown in a previous episode
92:28 - Andrew Brown exam Pro creator of many uh
92:32 - tutorials and he actually has like a
92:33 - degenerative voice condition so he makes
92:35 - heavy use of AI uh Speech synthesis
92:39 - tools and Freo Camp has a course coming
92:42 - up soon that will teach you how to uh to
92:44 - like kind of wrap your voice around like
92:46 - a you know a like a newscast or whatever
92:50 - other piece of audio to make it sound
92:51 - like you're saying it or you can speak
92:52 - different languages it's very cool
92:54 - without having actually put in the time
92:56 - to actually learn that's cool call me
92:58 - old school but I really enjoy learning
92:59 - languages and I will continue to do that
93:01 - though I'll probably never have time to
93:02 - like learn German for example so uh this
93:05 - will be a convenient tool if I need to
93:06 - like you know ever pretend that I can
93:08 - speak German or or Just Dub videos into
93:11 - German uh so it sounds like you're do
93:15 - you actively like follow what what is
93:17 - your information diet like how do you
93:19 - stay up on all the development in AI
93:22 - this very fast moving field I don't know
93:24 - I just think my feed tells me whether it
93:27 - is on Tik Tok or Google news or um
93:30 - YouTube or Reddit like just seem to
93:32 - stumble across these things and um if
93:35 - they're not getting much traction of his
93:37 - ability I like to create video content
93:39 - on it too so yeah yeah that's very cool
93:42 - so you're just out there you're just
93:43 - like consuming and reading you don't
93:46 - have like some carefully curated like
93:48 - RSS feed uh like that that is like
93:51 - exactly what you want to be learning uh
93:54 - I mean do you listen to like particular
93:56 - podcasts or anything like that to stay
93:58 - up on things no no podcasts I
94:01 - technically like I don't read the
94:03 - newspaper I don't really check out
94:06 - Reddit um like for the most part it's
94:10 - just somehow the algorithms on Google
94:12 - News tell me the Google News algorithms
94:15 - are pretty good in that
94:18 - regard yeah that's very cool so um I
94:22 - guess there's like you know in terms of
94:24 - productivity and something like just not
94:26 - taking the time to try to curate an
94:27 - information diet and just relying on
94:29 - algorithms to serve up good stuff it
94:31 - seems to be working for you yeah yeah
94:33 - for sure for sure awesome and just like
94:37 - a final kind of like question about like
94:39 - AI tool Tooling in general uh let's say
94:42 - you had a new client like maybe you can
94:45 - talk about how developing like a you
94:48 - know a marketing website for like
94:50 - somebody's got like some pharmaceutical
94:52 - product or something they want to create
94:53 - a website for that what would that
94:56 - process look
94:57 - like when you were first starting and
94:59 - what would that process look like today
95:01 - maybe you can just walk us through from
95:03 - memory what it used to be like and now
95:05 - what you would do if you had suddenly a
95:07 - job like that it's a good question I
95:09 - guess uh in the
95:11 - past um I would actually have a graphics
95:14 - designer so like the salesperson would
95:17 - kind of um make the sale their Graphics
95:19 - designer would put together all the
95:21 - assets in Adobe XD and then I would sit
95:24 - down and using Wordpress I would spend
95:27 - two weeks almost or like a week just
95:30 - writing out every template file for the
95:33 - homepage for all the subpages the
95:35 - headers the Footers writing out all the
95:37 - HTML writing out all the CSS I think I'd
95:40 - have like 5 to 10,000 lines of CSS maybe
95:43 - 5 to 10,000 lines of
95:45 - HTML and then I would spend a week like
95:48 - I would spend days doing all the
95:49 - responsive design and I would spend days
95:53 - um testing for all the bugs that would
95:55 - happen and eventually I'd pass that back
95:57 - to the designer there'd be new mockups
95:59 - I'd have to revise that
96:01 - design um and finally ship it to you
96:04 - know back to the sales guy who would
96:05 - present it to the client whereas now
96:09 - like I can sit down in a day and build
96:11 - it with the client in front of him just
96:14 - Dragon droing elements or pre-made
96:16 - templates and moving the about and
96:18 - putting his con um his work straight in
96:21 - there in front of him and even show him
96:23 - how to do that so that if he needs to
96:25 - make changes I don't have to do them
96:27 - every single time either so it's a
96:29 - completely different
96:31 - process wow that's dramatic so going
96:34 - from something that might take like an
96:36 - entire month of going back and forth
96:38 - have lots of parties involved to you
96:39 - literally being able to interface
96:41 - directly with the client right in front
96:42 - of them and build it out how would that
96:44 - affect billing if they're like oh this
96:45 - only took you like you know a few hours
96:48 - to build this website like how much do
96:49 - you think you could charge versus how
96:51 - much you used to be able to charge well
96:53 - if someone said they can build you a
96:55 - house rather than in a year they can do
96:57 - it for you in a month does that make the
96:58 - house more valuable or less valuable now
97:01 - that you don't have to pay for your
97:02 - mortgage for the rest of the year and
97:03 - you can move in objectively that doesn't
97:05 - that doesn't have any sort of I mean it
97:07 - makes the house more valuable for sure
97:10 - but traditionally have looked at work is
97:13 - like like there's that that old uh
97:15 - anecdote about Picasso right so Picasso
97:17 - is sitting in a cafe and uh This Woman's
97:20 - like oh Picasso can you draw something
97:22 - for me and he he takes out a you know
97:24 - pen and a piece of paper he's like does
97:27 - like one of his beautiful like oneline
97:28 - paintings like where he draws like the
97:30 - Wiener Dog with a single line from a pen
97:33 - and it takes it's just a few quick
97:34 - strokes and it takes a few seconds and
97:36 - she's like this is amazing thank you and
97:39 - he says that'll be $5,000 and she's like
97:42 - what $5,000 it only took you a few
97:44 - minutes and and he's like yes but it
97:47 - took me 60 years to become
97:50 - Picasso yeah right that's exactly it
97:52 - that's how things work and that's how
97:54 - value is created in the world but that's
97:56 - not how people are used to thinking it
97:57 - most people would be like that lady and
97:59 - they'd be like shocked like really you
98:00 - want thousands of dollars for what took
98:02 - you that much time but you as a
98:05 - developer as a designer uh as you know
98:08 - essentially a product manager uh
98:11 - have uh built this skill set you've
98:13 - learned how to use all these tools um
98:16 - like how much would you charge like in
98:18 - theory if somebody wanted like I'm not
98:20 - sure if anybody in the audience actually
98:22 - would want to pay your hourly or
98:23 - whatever but like if you were to sit
98:25 - down with somebody and build something
98:27 - right in front of them to their
98:28 - specifications what would that cost now
98:31 - versus what what might it have cost to
98:33 - have that entire mon as I said before it
98:35 - used to cost about $2,000 to do in a
98:38 - week or two now it cost about $20,000
98:41 - but I can get it done in a
98:44 - day and if you think about it I I always
98:47 - like to get the metaphor of like imagine
98:50 - you have a problem with your tooth it's
98:52 - a pain you know like a business pain
98:55 - right it's a pain in your tooth and you
98:56 - need a root canal now imagine having a
98:59 - to wait two months for a root canal and
99:01 - you have to come in five times for five
99:03 - surgeries for a root canal and by the
99:06 - end of it you spend half a year and
99:07 - $10,000 for a root canal I give you a
99:11 - procedure that takes a day and gets rid
99:13 - of that root canal for like you know
99:15 - about the same cost and it doesn't cause
99:17 - you any pain whatsoever would that not
99:19 - be more valuable to you than going
99:22 - through all that dentist pain and so
99:24 - that's the business mindset that uh
99:26 - business owners think about because for
99:28 - them their website means they're getting
99:30 - less conversions every day it's not
99:32 - working is that pain of a tooth
99:36 - essentially yeah that's a great way of
99:38 - framing it um and like what advice would
99:42 - you give to somebody who's doing like
99:44 - freelance development work and doing
99:45 - design work and potentially learning
99:47 - these tools so they can do what you do
99:49 - or they can sit down with the client
99:50 - like what advice would you give to them
99:53 - as as far as broaching that with a
99:55 - client who might already have it in
99:56 - their mind but it would only took you a
99:58 - few hours like I mean the ruk canal
100:00 - analogy of course something
100:03 - like yeah I would say go on YouTube
100:06 - search up Chris do Chris
100:09 - Doo um from the future and he has
100:13 - thousands of videos on how to talk with
100:16 - clients on exactly this subject to
100:18 - showcase the value of what you're
100:21 - building rather than just the hours that
100:24 - you're
100:26 - working
100:28 - yeah awesome man well that that is a
100:30 - great advice and I will look him up and
100:32 - I'll include a link to him in the show
100:34 - notes Adrian it's been so amazing
100:37 - catching up with you thanks for staying
100:38 - up late uh and just uh sharing your many
100:42 - insights with the community I hope
100:44 - everybody tuning in has learned a great
100:46 - deal from Adrien I hope you'll uh check
100:48 - out his his book hope you'll check out
100:50 - some of his you know free Cod Camp
100:51 - courses he's got a epic
100:53 - you know wire Framing and like
100:55 - development I think you use figma you
100:57 - may use some other tools in that video
100:59 - course that we published a while back uh
101:01 - are we going to get some new videos from
101:02 - you in the future yeah I think so I've
101:05 - got um some plugs in the roots oh sorry
101:07 - in the works and I've got some video
101:09 - content that I'm doing for the enhanced
101:12 - UI book so I'll see if I can maybe turn
101:14 - that into like a five hour long course
101:16 - for you guys cuz the minimum amount of
101:18 - time usually for a video of
101:21 - yours well I again I've learned so much
101:25 - from you over time uh and I'm continuing
101:28 - to learn like just over the past hour
101:29 - and a half I've learned a tremendous
101:30 - amount from you and it it's so
101:32 - refreshing to hear your perspective
101:34 - because I don't think you're a
101:36 - contrarian and you're like thinking
101:38 - differently from everybody else just to
101:41 - stand out I think you just have the most
101:44 - kind of pragmatic perspective on getting
101:46 - things done and it's so refreshing it's
101:48 - like you're like the least dogmatic
101:50 - person I've ever talked to in this field
101:52 - probably like all right well that's good
101:54 - to hear yeah it's great so um yeah well
101:58 - thank you again and for everybody uh
102:01 - listening to this I hope you enjoyed
102:03 - learning from Adrien and uh until next
102:06 - week happy coding thanks say yeah

Cleaned transcript:

we had like a a brand new son in the world I wasn't sleeping we had a huge mortgage there was so many debts it was a very very stressful time and I was just thinking like one day I have to tell my son like what do I do as a job and I thought well I want to tell him that I followed my passions and I did something I was really excited about and so that's one of the reasons as well that I decided to take the risk leave what I knew for like 10 years of doing it and jump into web that I've never done before welcome back to the freec Cod Camp podcast I'm Quincy Larson teacher and founder of freecodecamp.org each week we're bringing you Insight from developers Founders and ambitious people getting into Tech and this week we are talking with none of other than Adrien torog developer designer and teacher of some of the most popular courses on using low code tools no code tools AI tools again he's a software engineer who's gone out of his way to learn these new kind of like contemporary power tools and apply them to get things done faster and he's going to be able to share some insight into how he does that Adrien welcome to the podcast hey Quincy uh thanks for having me on I'm really excited to do this cuz I'm working on some really cool stuff so I can't wait to share it but uh yeah let's get into it yeah man well uh you and I have known each other since really like I'm always proud of like scouting the talent as it's emerging you know like I saw very early on like wow this guy the production value of his courses the caliber of his teaching skills and his communication ability and just the charm of your courses like really struck me and so we are proud to have published several of your courses over the years on the Freo Camp YouTube channel and and I am proud to have learned quite a bit from you just like you know reading your articles and watching your videos and stuff so that's I wanted to take an opportunity yeah I wanted to take an opportunity to learn a little bit more about you in like your developer origin story uh I know you have like a computer science degree and everything but so many things about you are very unconventional like the way you approach technology you're you're like the extreme pragmatist in terms of like I just want to get stuff done you like all the talk about out the window all the you know um all the sacred rules are uh you know thrown onto the Altar and like set of Blaze yeah maybe you could talk about just and also another cool thing about you you grew up in Perth right Australia like yeah probably most isolated geog place in the whole world right yeah it's I mean geographically I don't think you could get farther from Silicon Valley yeah it's rough it's rough so got to be on the cloud essentially but uh YouTube's been a great place to be able to connect and meet people like you for example so it's been great yeah man well uh I'm excited to learn a little bit about your kind of developer origin story and how you guys started like do you remember as a kid like your first interactions with computers all right yeah I do um so when I was in Primary School my first uh use of computers was there was only one computer in the entire School and me being myself like I I was always on there using it and playing around in I think it was like uh Doss back then and just trying to like run commands or like unzip things and show them to my classmates so I was already like across all of that and I I I can see myself from a young kid enjoying that and so as I was in uh High School obviously information Tech was like kind of my favorite subject I scored 100% for everything and as I went to high school like that's pretty much what I was doing as well I was just enjoying that kind of stuff going to the library researching about it and at one point I have to design um decide a career path uh cuz I was going to college but my parents actually said don't do programming or web or anything there's no jobs in there it was still early days internet wasn't really that popular and they said I should do security because you know everyone will be all about computer security the money will be there and I was wasn't too sure but I did computer security and computer science at college and so I left webdev on the side and programming on the side and instead of doing the traditional route where people go to college and they learn about it I kind of treated it more like a hobby something I did on the side so like when Wikipedia came out I made my own Wikipedia clone I learned how to like code in PHP and I was learning all those Basics HTML CSS all the way back then like 10 15 years ago and and it was great it was really fun because it wasn't something I was studying it wasn't something I was going to work in cuz I was still learning to do computer science and I slowly pivoted towards it like doing it help desk installing Windows and servers and stuff like that and so web and programming was still always a hobby and I kept playing around with it I I kept learning like the latest JavaScript U methodologies and latest um implementations of esm or whatever it was called back then but um and then B Babel came across as well or Babel I think people call it Babble I was just reading I was just reading because I was an Enthusiast on that I just loved it and I had studied so much of programming that when I was in it and I wasn't enjoying it for um because I had I had graduated by that point and I got into the workplace I was working in it I didn't really like it cuz I was always dealing with problems always trying to like oh my computer doesn't turn on or this doesn't work and people were always grumpy and at one point I left that job cuz I was made redundant and I joined a marketing company when you were made redundant you were like laid off essentially or how does that uh well not really what ended up happening was um there was a downturn in the economy and people were asking for voluntary redundancies and so I asked I had been there for like five or six years already so I asked for a volunt redundancy so I had a bit of a pay um like a bit of a surplus like a safety net of cash there so I could try out webd and I felt like I'm going to have to start at the very beginning because I've got no experience whatsoever I have no idea what I'm doing I've never worked in web dev Dev before and strangely enough the passion of working at as a hobby for so many years actually meant that when I went into doing web dev doing like basic web websites from the ground up just coding them I was kind of good at it and I also still enjoyed doing it it was still like mentally it's like a hobby for me and so I found it amazing and not only that like within half a year of working at that marketing company they asked me to be one of the directors and buy into the company to be a shareholder and own a third of the company which I did like a partner and yeah I I became a partner exactly and so so suddenly this pivot of like swapping from it to web became amazing like I I felt like I was doing what I enjoyed every single day so for me I didn't traditionally study anything it was more like a hobbying hobby kind of thing where I was just following up on the latest news and so yeah I worked in that company for a few years and uh Co happened so when Co happened um I I'm want to stop you there because I just want to unpack some of the things that uh you shared cuz Co like I don't know anybody who made better use of that uh time than you uh and I've talked to a lot of people who were very busy including myself during that period making the most of the lockdowns and of the sudden surge in online like the interest in online learning and things like that uh we were very well positioned when we went into that I want to absolutely talk about that I do want to share a couple quick things about what you just said first of all um it's so cool how you were able to get out of you know it uh internet things and no it's not really internet things that's that's a joke if you've ever seen the IT Crowd I have I have yeah Information Technology like you were able to get out of like that kind of like help desk type uh you know often like looked at as is kind of like the I mean I don't want to slight anybody who's in it currently but many people are probably listening to this wanting to get into actual software development and things like that and and they're familiar with the uh you know the lack of respect that people generally have like you're the guy who fixes my computer do it you know yeah that's how it was really yeah yeah so you you worked you worked doing that for did you say six years uh six years in that company and then two years in Consulting beforehand and then another two years in the schooling system before that so probably like a decade 10 years fixing people's computers basically and setting up networks and stuff like that right did you have any of those certifications like the all of them micros ones and the VMware ones and the um Cisco ones yeah all of those back in the day the mcps and um Cisco asserts and whatnot okay wow so you like you were like a literal it guy so to speak like that I Grew From like to level two network engineer to level three system engineer to the senior Sy engineer yeah I did all of that so it wasn't how accurate go yeah how accurate to your daytoday life was the show the IT Crowd the the British comedy did you ever watch that yeah yeah yeah I did it's um when you're talking with people it definitely feels like that kind of an experience where like they don't pluck in a cable and that's why something's not working and 90% of problems are fixed when you just turn something on and off even now today my camera wasn't working and so I rebooted my computer and then my camera's working working so it's like that that's so cool so for sure uh uh you talked about dos and I have to share this because I just learned this did you know that dos didn't originally stand for dis operating system okay it was originally called qos when Microsoft bought it and that stood for quick and dirty operating system oh because it was created it was just like thrown together very quickly and of course it became like this integral part of like you know I guess personal computers in general like pretty much every computer who that had Windows which was built on top of Dos but it was originally just some software that Microsoft purchased from this developer solo Dev who just built it because they were in a hurry to get an operating system together it was called quick and dirty dos and they thought we're not going to be able to sell something with dirty to the uh you know Enterprises of the world they don't want dirty software they want of course so they just remove the quick and dirty and they yeah they changed the uh quick and dirty operating system to Disk Operating System just to make it sound very generic kind of IBM like but uh yeah I just learned that and I wanted to share that with uh everybody listening because it's it's kind of a cool story TI but uh your company did like probably one of the dumbest things any company can do and that's basically like hey we don't have enough you know money to keep everybody on the staff if you voluntarily leave we'll give you like a onetime payout or something like that right yeah think about what is going to happen when you do that uh like any managers in the audience are probably like you know their hair is standing up on their arms thinking about like uh any company well this was a big company though it had like hundreds and hundreds of employees if I left it didn't really matter is likely to happen what is likely to happen sorry I hope I'm not interrupting we have a huge time difference between the two of us uh like again you're like as far geographically there's probably at least like you know half a second of latency between you and me right now um so think about what happens when you say hey uh anybody who wants to can leave and you'll get like a onetime payout like who is going to leave your company is it going to be the weakest people on the team who phoned in every day and like they're not going to want to go get on the job market they're not going to be confident in their skills who's going to take the payout and leave the Adrien twarog of the world who are like you know uh 10x developers like rock stars you know whatever you want to call them basically but people who get things done and are like passionate about what they're doing and are constantly expanding their skills and stuff those are the people that are going to walk out the door if you essentially bribe them to leave just so you can reduce your uh your headcount and your payroll and stuff so uh that is like basically the dumbest HR decision you can make like in my opinion as a manager if we ever got in a situation where we needed to do layoffs and you know knock on wood free C Camp's never had to do that and we we've like structured the entire thing like where we just save a ton of money and we keep costs as low as possible so we can keep all our instructional staff all our uh um you know all of our uh engineering team like in place uh but we would never do that we would just have those hard conversations and choose people and let them go because yeah like what your company basically did was they ensured that only the weakest people stay at the company and what happened to that company are they are they still yeah they're a huge organization so like they're a chamber of commerce essentially and so every single business in Perth is pretty much a member of them so they can wether like the Australian chamber like we have American Chamber of Commerce the West Australian Chamber of Commerce ah okay cool well I'm glad they're still around and that this wasn't like a fatal mistake but I do believe just extremely limited knowledge of the situation I think this is always a mistake and if your management ever offers you money to like leave the company you should take that money should run cuz that sign of like uh first of all ineptitude in the management and it's also uh you've got you can absolutely go out and get better opportunities right um so and to add to that story as well it wasn't as easy as I make it sound at that point in time like I had no savings whatsoever um my wife and I had just gave birth to oh my wife gave birth to our son and so we had like a a brand new son in the world I was wasn't sleeping we had a huge mortgage there was so many debts it was a very very stressful time and I was just thinking like one day I have to tell my son like what do I do as a job and I thought well I want to tell him that I followed my passions and I did something I was really excited about and so that's one of the reasons as well that I decided to take the risk leave what I knew for like 10 years of doing it and jump into web that I've never done before so it yeah it was a very tough decision but like I'm really happy I did it yeah you followed your dreams man uh and I I want to like dig in a little bit more into those dreams cuz we just like you know got into your 30s basically very quickly probably uh maybe we can talk about um what those dreams were early on like you uh just inputting commands into Doss being kind of delighted and enthralled by just the most fundamental aspects of working with computers uh what were your dreams do you do you remember so I always like building ideas um whether they were little projects or little startups um I think the very first thing that I couldn't do was get some really cool games that were being released in Japan and so I figured out a way to get a like go to a Japanese website manually translated download their emulator and ROM and then run those games locally at my school computers and I'm like all right I figured out this like really complex solution and these games are still in Japanese but they're still fun to play and then after that I thought when I'm going to high school I wanted to build a little system that keeps all my notes for me basically OTE or one note today and later after that Wikipedia came out as well and then um after that I'm like all right what other ideas can I build so I always was kind of building ideas and I built them in private and sometimes I built the whole thing and I didn't know how to release it sometimes I built half of them but I was always this is the hobby side of things where I always was enjoying that process of creating things and programming let me do that so your passion for games LED you to like find these kind of cool workarounds with emulation and stuff like that uh I'm I'm obviously like like I can tell from your your background by the way I just want to compliment your background that's a real background that is not a green screen uh you can reach out and touch that YouTube uh 100,000 subscriber award you can touch that Pikachu yeah that is anybody who's listening to the audio version uh if you get a chance to check out the video version you can see his background but uh you know we we keep this like I intentionally keep the visuals to a minimum here so everybody who's listening to the audio version gets the full basically The Full Experience other than looking at me and whatever video game I've got like one of those three kingdom arcade games uh in the background right going so you don't have to just look at my face you can look at the cool video game in the background if you get tired of looking at my face uh but you've got a really rocking background so um I'm excited to hear that like you were into games early on and that kind of further fueled your passion for technology that is definitely a Common Thread among a lot of the people that we have on the free podcast is uh yeah like that's that I used to say that like the way that like most of the developers I talked to got into software development was through like a passion for games right doing something like uh just learning how to like you know do like a route on um like a like Super Nintendo uh SNES mini or something like that or learning how to uh sideload stuff onto like an Android phone and like be able to have hundreds of thousand of when I was in primary school no sorry High School I bought myself a pal like I worked a day job and bought myself one of the original like touch device Palms that HP released and so like I would load different software on yeah the PD I was like the only person in the entire school with one so that's pretty you they must have thought you were like a drug dealer or something what may expensive consumer electronics thing exactly exactly yeah but but you P you uh prioritize getting these kinds of tools because you enjoy technology exactly so even now like I love down um grabbing like the latest Oculus Rift or VR and seeing like how can I play around with it what can I do inside of there that isn't otherwise available um I like playing around with Raspberry Pi is or even just getting a projector and seeing if I can like connect up the Raspberry Pi to a projector and then just like run it on a solar panel or something like that it's just fun putting different ideas together like that so you have kind of like a recombinative uh approach to like technology like taking a bunch of offtheshelf things like almost modules and putting them together and uh we're going to talk a lot about that during this interview because you are a huge staunch advocate of using like low code tools no code tools AI tools to get things done and kind of like glue your custom code together or your custom code is rather gluing these powerful tools together um and building applications but it's like you're you're playing with power tools instead of you know Hammers and and saws um and that that is definitely the vibe I've gotten from you and a lot of what I know about lood I've learned from you oh thanks yeah no um look like when I used to so I love drones as well flying drones and everything and so like 5 10 years ago before DJI made prebuilt drones they would just sell you the kit and the flight computer and everything you'd have to Pro I would program my own flight computer connect it up to a controller configure the controller um solder all the components together and then learn to fly it right and so one of the things that I learned Lear early on is I learned a lot by doing that that it was a lot of fun but now it's so much easier when the Drone is built for you and everything set up and so if you think about npm and npm packages that's kind of the same thing they kind of solve problems for you and they're me ready for you to use and one step further from that is like the no code tools and low code tools they're ready for you to use so you don't have to rebuild the same thing from the ground up and that's why I've kind of always been at that bleeding edge of technology so whether it was back in the day like the programming whether it was the low code and whether it is AI now that's kind of like the Horizon I like to be across and the kind of content I like to do as well yeah and uh before we get too much into that like I I do want to talk about a little bit about your career progression after you left it uh again taking a big risk you said you had a mortgage you had a newborn son uh and wife wasn't working either it's just all on my shoulders for the for the salary so it was yeah aough decision entire fam's putting you know putting food on the table was down to you and your ability security if you work at a job for six years you have security there right and if you have a mortgage you know the bank looks at how long you've been working at a job if I just jump jobs to a new job from that job I go into a career I've never gone into so I'm at the very bottom and I take a salary cut where my salary basically gets cut in half from what I was working at so like before I was working on a about 80,000 and I dropped down to 40,000 a year so it was like a huge cut in salary so yeah it was a scary thing to do yeah I can only imagine uh and it sounds like you started at the bottom like can you describe what it was like arriving some guy uh you were probably in your late 20s early 30s at this point like showing up at the developer Bullpen like uh what was that what were those first few months like working as a developer um it was interesting cuz I was coming into this company replacing one of the other developers right and so he would normally spend one month to build a website and then I would come in now and I would build that entire website in a week same kind of website and I'm just like all right why did it take him a month to make it and so it was the very first time I had ever done it working properly in a job so then the next time I built the website built it in 5 days then the next time I build it in 4 days and the other guy was still building it he was now subcontracting for the company cuz he wanted to work somewhere else um he was still taking a month to do it and I was now taking 4 days to do it and so slowly over time I realized that like programming is a bit of a skill if you don't upskill you're always going to stay at the same time um place and I think this guy was set in his ways he wasn't developing his skill sets he was just kind of reusing what he knew and it was taking him a long time whereas I was always upskilling and that upskilling had a huge benefit over time and so that's why I was was a lot further ahead than him even though it was the very first job I ever worked at it was the very first few websites I have ever ever created just my hobbying and learning and always staying up to um base with what's happening in programming had me further ahead than him who had been working in it for 10 years yeah wow and it sounds like uh you you very much have like a growth mindset so to speak and uh you just proactively are out there absorbing I mean you use the term bleeding Edge earlier uh you like to stay right at at the at the for Forefront it's ahead of The Cutting Edge it's the bleeding edge C things might die or they might come to fruition like I remember when react came out for for the very first time and nobody was using it at all it was like so new that there wasn't even like a a release it was just like a thing on Facebook and I was already using it then and node came out and I'm like all right this is going to you sometimes you can just tell these are going to be the technologies that stay I was already at node at like 0.02 or whatever the release was early early on um and yeah building tools with it so it was it was great fun and it just meant that as I saw them progress and as each new change log came in I was reading every single line that was being released every new feature that was there um kind of like how bun is out there now and um Deno like as soon as that got released like I'm always there essentially yeah awesome shout out to the Deno subreddit which I'm the sole moderator of because I it's happened so many times I I may have told this story before like some new technology comes out and some big Corporation comes in and like squats the subreddit essentially so I was like I'll show them I'm going to get the D subredit so that no no bad actor can get it I I should probably do that more frequently when they announce new technologies go find the and I mean it wasn't just like I didn't just go and like oh I'd like the dental sub like any four character combination or something like that is probably going to be taken I had to go through this lengthy process with like the Reddit you know overlords to get it but I was able to get it um getting a domain essentially our nonprofits I have that one although I haven't really done anything with it uh because there most people just use r nonprofit but um sorry total tangent but so what you're saying is it's almost like you're you're like the venture capitalist of learning in terms of you know you're taking risky speculative you you're investing risky speculative amounts of time in learning these new tools which may or may not become mainstream uh you know for every for every uh nodejs there are like you know 20 different technologies that just like do you remember you know gulp well guess guess who yeah I do I was using that and guess who was using open AI two years before chat GPT came out this guy awesome I did use it a little bit with gpt2 uh like the public Edition the the the playground I think they called it back in the day and I was like just but it was a spectacle I wasn't actually using it to do any work I was just like isn't this cool you know but but you were you actually using it to get work done it and I would I would build applications on there for my marketing company to do things like generate ads that now like every company is trying to do that but back then there wasn't the appetite for that and in order to use their API for like one task you had to go through a safety checklist of like 20 Questions showing examples and your code to go through andove the use of something that's only 20 tokens 20 tokens was the limit which if you think about it that's like one or two sentences yeah was saying back then so limited and you can't have like it doesn't store stuff in memory like what gbt and these newer tools uh like I think Claude can hold like 100,000 tokens or something and it's context window uh so you were working with the most primordial primitive versions of these tools and you were still finding ways to use them yeah one of the cool ideas I had was um and this is something I built out and then sold was a micro auto complete and so because the context window was so small what I would do is I would grab the last um five paragraphs you wrote and then it would guess the next two words you're right and so it's almost like the auto complete you have in vs code but because it's only um guessing the next two words you have it's really quick it's like when you go on Gmail sometimes and you go hello and it just fill out hello you know Quincy and sometimes just fills out those two words but when you're writing a document sometimes that's useful and you could just hit tab tab tab tab tab tab tab and it wres out a sentence for you so I had to be creative in the ways that I would like utilize open AI back then yeah so getting in early with the tools I I want to get back to your uh your office like how did your bosses react seeing like wow this new kid is really fast at building stuff like what were your first uh how can we make more money for for this right so for them um they thought all right one they can do more sales so their sales pipeline increased but two it unfortunately it meant we can sell websites cheaper now because rather than 40 hours to make a website it only takes Adrian 8 hours to make a website and so instead of charging $10,000 for a webs it now will charge $2,000 for the for a website and so what ended up happening is the company doesn't actually makes more money I just get more busy with more work for the same amount of money and that was one of the issues I had I suppose working at the marketing company like it ended up being just me working a whole lot like I enjoyed programming but I didn't end up making any more money nor did the company make any more money so that's where I started thinking I need to think of other ways to to make money whether it is startup ideas or creative Endeavors or something I I was thinking what can I do and so that was always in the back of my uh mind and I started you know reaching out to friends and trying to see where can I get ideas for doing that yeah so how long were you with this company ultimately uh probably five years where you were now a partner for five years okay yeah so so five years and when do you remember when you left did you leave before the pandemic uh no aftera after um so go on you've got a question that I can hear it yeah yeah yeah like like we're getting we're ramping up to the the main course of the Adrien toog Saga which is the pandemic but uh like so during this time you're you're kind of feeling I mean it sounds like they probably could have found some happy medium between charging $10,000 of or a website in charging 2,000 and maybe it was closer to like 5,000 that the market would have borne I don't know but it it feels like just be you know they should have adjusted the rates to reflect the increased productivity uh that you were doing and were you teaching anybody else or were you like the sole developer at this company so first year I was working with them um and they saw you know I'm a pretty good person to work with second year I became a partner um and I owned a portion of the business third year um we started hiring stuff we grew the team to 10 people um then the fourth year the pandemic happened so like the third year I had like I actually hired two or three developers at that point in time so I was actually mentoring people um and then the fourth year Co happened so we had to let go of those stuff because we didn't have the money for it and when Co hit and we're were all working from home and that's when I started YouTube yeah and again as I said earlier like nobody that I know made better use of that time than you did in terms of just establish yourself as a teacher yeah tell me and I decided I watched everyone on YouTube and they're all making tutorials so the way I decided to make my content was how about I show people real websites which I'm working at my company and since I'm director I can you know decide what I'm going to publish or not how about I show them real websites I'm building for clients and they can get an idea of this and I'll also turn them into templates so that they can download themselves and utilize for their own clients and so every every day I was working and every day I was recording myself work and so I had videos every day come out um I think I made about 300 videos in the year of Co which is absolutely insane um but that was pretty much just me every day going to work doing my work recording myself and then collecting whatever the gold nuggets are from that and then publishing it and then I finish my workday and then I'd do the next work day and I'd record myself while I'm doing my work and publish a video so I would not only get my work done but I'd also have video content out there and grow that YouTube channel which was a great time to do yeah man 301 year so basically like pretty much every day uh and and this is while you had you know a youngish child exactly it still meant like I was still doing my um Family responsibility still playing with my son going out to family events and then at the end of the day everyone's asleep at 700 p.m. I'm like all right well I've got an hour or two I'm going to record a tutorial and then I'm going to publish it and so even Saturdays and Sundays I would knock those out as well wow and just to let everybody know who's watching this again you're in Perth here in Texas it is 946 a.m. when we're recording this like what time is it over there uh it's closing into 1100 p.m. yeah so you it sounds like you're a night ow or you've acclimated to being able to you know work late at night um in a way that most are not able to a lot of coffee but um a r what time do you stop drinking coffee just out of curiosity oh um I usually like to break it up between meals so like one before breakfast one um one after lunch and then one after dinner so interesting so you're like literally drinking coffee after dinner 6 p.m. you're drinking coffee yeah yeah what time do you usually go to bed um around 11 or 12 oh okay so so like we're we're cring up against your your bedtime so you're yeah uh so if I reach to the screen and kind of like shake your shoulder to this is the time for lighting cuz I don't have any sun or anything coming through no harsh lights I can like set up the scene really well for the backdrop and everything like that man your lighting approach is totally different like I'm in front of like big you know Windows basically and I just use all natural lighting uh I don't know I I just like like having through 1 two three four five six seven eight nine 10 10 lights that I control wow so it's like a like a moon landing over there you it looks like a complete mess outside of the frame but inside of the frame it looks great yeah man I also have a fog machine as well to add like a little bit of that Haze in the background yeah really you have you so you're you're actually like adding texture to the background with it also this low Rand the lights which is nice so you'll find that a lot of people that do cinematic scene setups that's they always have a hazer a hazer that sounds like something that only a fraternity would have Okay so let's talk about um let's talk let's talk about like your daytoday workflow during Co because I mean you establish that at night you're I mean you're drinking coffee all day you're you're doing normal family stuff but you're you're also you know excusing yourself from dinner with your thing of coffee going into your your workshop and you're recording tutorials you're publishing them and you're not just like when you publish on YouTube YouTube is not just like oh I'll just upload the video like you got to do some editing probably you have to like come up with a fun thumbnail uh thumbnail is very important uh you'll see a lot of experimentation with the thumbnails uh on uh YouTube and thanks to Bo KS uh who runs the free cocain YouTube for for coming up with some of these silly thumbnails um but uh yeah the getting people to actually click through and watch your video that's important so originally like everybody starts up uploading and maybe YouTube will throw you like three or five views or something like that right like I frequently watch videos that have like no views that sounds weird but like sometimes I'll be like the first person to watch a video and I'll be like wow it's like so cool it's it's cool to be like in the ground floor but um yeah like like what was your early YouTube growth like so it it's a tricky thing because when I came in it felt like the whole scene was so saturated there are so many people doing content there was like this deved guy which was like funny and this like web def simplified guy with like beautiful hair and like I I'm just like how do I get into this scene and so I thought it was impossible but I thought all right what I'm good at is um like breaking things down and improving them like I'm always at the Forefront of that and so when I made videos say I wanted to do one on CSS animation and I had to do one better than um Kevin um what I would do is the Cs the king of CSS exactly and so I would look at his video like I would search something like U for example CSS animations right I would look at his video I would then have a look at every other video in search I would go through the video and see every topic he covered then I would research CSS animation and I would write up a script that covers everything he did plus extra in a shorter and more succinct amount of time with a better thumbnail and a better title better tags better description more um uh timestamps even though time stamps weren't even a thing back then as well as rather than 1080p which was thing I was already on 4K back then I was like having a look at every single thing I can do to create a video that is better than whatever was ly there on search so whether it was a video about CSS animation whether it was about react and its implementations whether it was about bootstrap every video I researched I had to look at how can I improve on all the videos that are out there and make a better video and that's kind of how I did it every single day day down by day and I tried to improve by 1% every time as well so each time I had a little bit more budget I'd get a better microphone I'd get you know I started off with no backdrop and then I got you know a bookshelf and I filled it out with stuff and I got a better um lighting setup so bit by bit it eventuated to where I am now essentially yeah wow so one thing to note like uh first of all I love the way that you just kind of incrementally upgraded stuff as your budget could provide um and you know you can make money on YouTube which we can talk about in a little bit uh but it's not like you know Scrooge McDuck jumping into the Vault and swimming around in the coins by the way if you actually ever have a vault filled with like gold coins and stuff don't attempt to dive into it um but that might hurt yeah yeah it might hurt might leave it in um so you uh it sounds like you were able to focus on like different production considerations and stuff but it is worth noting that you are a skilled teacher those years you spent at the agency training other developers in different cont you know Concepts and stuff spent in it explaining things right but but like that time it sounds like you did learn a lot about like how to communicate knowledge how to impart knowledge um because no I didn't actually that's that's the thing that I think a lot of people skip out on that that's not where I learned I learned it from watching People's videos as I said and doing the research researching how they're delivering their topics and then also going and researching how um the details are on like CSS animation on different websites and then putting that into a for formula script that has no fluff so like one of the things that I don't do very well on my videos is there's not much personality I don't add many jokes there's not much like um stuff like that it's just pure like what's the pure essence of how I can teach a concept in as little words as possible so you really optimize for tness and uh man you're like the first person I think that's ever actually like said no I'm not a great teacher you know like like has deflected deflected my uh attempt at at uh edifying you uh but but I mean that makes sense so you you really took like a clinical approach to this dissecting what makes things work uh as opposed to like like almost like like uh a Quant might tear apart like a baseball team and figure out like why are we actually losing these games like completely uh like passionless and just very uh well yeah exactly you to have a look like where is the wind resistance coming from the B what's the better Tire you can use how can you make the frame a little bit um less heavy like every bit by bit by bit by bit um because like the cyclist is going to cycle he's going to like move his wheels but it's all the other things that goes behind the scenes that if you're cycling 40 kilm these 1% gains they have a lot of traction interesting so it's a very marginal kind of um approach to gradually just teching up different aspects of your videos I wouldn't say that my videos suddenly made me successful it was definitely a linear path of success that might have had a little bit of a escalation um ju to those 1% but like uh what did they say about interest there was a saying for that I mean it compound over 300 videos a 1% increase is you're going to have the best videos on in the universe if you can actually do 100 1% for 300 iterations in a row um yeah that's pretty phenomenal I actually I might be incorrect uh I would have to pull up my uh calculator CU I can't do that sort of stuff in my head figure out like what what is the total Improvement that would be experienced if you were to improve 1% for 300 days ask GPT that real quick I think it's 37.5 times over a year if it's 1% per day MH you would get if you improved 1% each day for 300 days yeah and it's going to do some python here probably so just yeah it shows me the it's just a compound interest formula um yeah and so it's it's calculating it with python I'm just dictating what what GPD is is doing essentially uh it's is 20.99 times the initial amount uh yeah it's pretty good it's like a you know 2,000 and I can see that I can show you like my old videos and you'll see that it's very clear and obvious how much of an improvement that there is and that's why any of my advice to people that want to be creatives and do content on YouTube is do 100 videos it's the same thing Jimmy slm Beast says do 100 videos that'll help you improve the most and then after that figure out what topics you want to do yeah yeah or as I was told uh by the uh writer at Denny's where I was drinking coffee who saw me like working on a draft uh was like throw your first million words away just keep writing and uh it's gonna take time quality takes time and it sounds like uh you you just incrementally improved each facet of these videos and that's how you arrived at your current level of quality which you know when we say current level of quality it's probably still climbing right are you still finding little ways to improve always always yeah so what I like to do go oh go ahead go ahead I still like to research other verticals when I say verticals I mean like channels in say photography or channels in um design or channels in um lifestyle and have a look at like what kind of things are they doing that I can Implement into the coding space to make programming videos a little bit more enjoyable yeah because you're so passionate about programming technology but not everybody's just born trying different commands in Doss right like a lot of people uh they need something to like ignite that passion you need to hold their attention long enough for them to really cultivate an interest in going deeper with technology yeah that's true so it sounds like importing a lot of those uh I mean like there are a lot more accessible Fields than programming You could argue that programming is one of the least accessible fields and that you have to have some baseline understanding of like computer science how computers work probably have to some basic understanding of mathematics you you need to understand like a lot of different concepts before you can really even like attempt to program without just being completely you know befuddled and frustrated right uh so whereas if you show somebody like hey here's a cooking tutorial let's crack the eggs let's you know mix them let's add you know a teaspoon of uh yeah that I can't get into that's that's beyond me you know cooking tutorials but but it is like a physical thing like it's a it's a procedure that probably anybody can watch and like if if you put them in some situation where like you're going to go to jail for 10 years unless you can make me an alet right now here the people could probably do like an OM right whereas if you if you gave somebody the same proposition you're going to uh unless you do rot 13 in the next 20 minutes you're going to go to jail for 10 years like they they would probably you know not be able to do that the typical lay person right just because it it is like it's not a dark art programming is something that can be learned obviously like we're teaching millions of people to learn each month through free Cod camp and you're teaching probably at least hundreds of thousands of people how to use these different tools each month um maybe you can talk a little bit about what it is the you're teaching and what has because I look at your YouTube videos um and you've got some very popular videos like 5 million views um on some of your different project videos and most of your most popular videos are around GPT because you rode that wave and you were like one of the first people you were on the ground floor you were already ready you already understood how to wield these tools when suddenly GPT chat GPT kind of kicked off this chain reaction and got everybody talking about Ai and stuff y so it's the question the question what are your videos about like these days like what are the what would you say the main focus uh if people were like going to your YouTube channel like what would they go there to learn primarily and what are you I had the two channels I've got my Adrian Taro Channel and I like to these days think that that's kind of about programming and AI then I've got a second Channel called codex community and that channel is about design no code and a little bit of AI because AI is pretty much everywhere these days but more about design and no code so it kind of one is more about programmers and one is more about those people that don't want to program but they still want to build websites right so you could like there's this term like Technical and nontechnical right like so Semite technical people uh who may know a little bit about coding but don't want to spend all day in vs code like wiring things together they might use low code tools or no code tools or AI Tools in order to get things done instead so codex is kind of like catering toward those people whereas like the main Adrian toog channel is like the the super user like the person who does know how to program and also wants to indeed harvest the utility of these tools I guess like the Adrian twarog one is more also personalized cuz it's me working sometimes on Creative projects I like to work on and so that's why like some of my videos are like me building an RPG as a website so rather than having a fitness tracker or a food tracker you have your life covered as an RPG and you can see your strength and endurance and health and stuff like that I just like to see at like how can I make a creative topic or how can I make a programming thing more interesting than it otherwise is rather than just creating a todo list cuz you know that doesn't really excite me that much yeah those those standard uh projects that people do like portfolio projects um yeah there's always like a todo list there's usually some sort of like you know currency exchange calculator like um calorie counter you stuff like that that are they're cool good projects to get you started but you could also do something that nobody's ever done before right uh you you could you can follow your Flights of Fancy and create like uh I I don't know like a Pokedex for um for you know KPop singers or something like that you know what whatever wherever your passions like overlap you could you could build something in that space and so you built this it's a pretty cool project uh I watched the video last night just to re refresh I'd seen it before but basically you do build an RPG that like tracks different aspects of of your life that you're you're trying to Monitor and improve and kind of gamifies your actual real life and not just Gam like you might use run keeper or straa or one of those tools to like track your runs or something but this is like an allencompassing like you are the role playing character and you have stats and you want to buff those stats right exactly it's just a different mindset of like how you track your life rather than just like the traditional way you want to gamify it essentially CU everything that's gamified is a little bit more fun these days yeah and I'm going to link to the video in the show notes but uh the funny thing about that video is like it's one of my most popular videos but it doesn't really teach anyone anything there's no programming in there it's more like a storytelling video I bring people along the Journey of me trying to solve how I'm going to build this thing and I kind of give them the summary of the problems I encountered when I was coding it and then just show them the solution so if you want to learn code you're not going to learn anything from that video but if you're going in there to get some motivation some inspiration to have a look at a cool creative idea and even if you want to download the code and build it up yourself you can jump into the description I've put it on GitHub so you can actually run it up yourself so that's the kind of video I like to make a lot of yeah yeah and one of the cool things about that video in a lot of your videos is you don't just start open up vs code all right let's you know get this you know these libraries in place or anything like that no you start with sketching things out um you you are kind of like a designer at least in how you approach different things and of course you've got like mad design chops which we'll talk about a little bit like you've like published an entire book about design uh but uh you like to actually start out with like paper and pencil or in this video you use like an iPad and like one of those apple pencils that cost like 50 bucks I don't know if they're actually worth it but but like you use that thing and you start like drawing out a UI uh and yeah maybe you can talk a little about your workflow when you approach building a project and do you still start that way do you still start with like a blank canvas and start you know hashing out UI details right there with a pen so um funny enough I still use that same iPad and I still use that same pencil apple pencil and so yes I still do it that way it's one of the ways that I like to create like any idea where I actually just sketch it out like what am I trying to solve how can I brainstorm this what are the key elements and then I can kind of map them map out and then when I map them out I like to then visually map them out so rather than creating a design I just sketch it out like little squares and whatnot to like visualize what will this actually look like when it's working and so that kind of makes the whole process of building it a lot easier it's like saying oh the the recent idea I'm building is a Pokédex it's a Pokédex for real life and so you know Pokemon 20 years ago had this cool AI thing that you take a photo of any animal and it tells you what it is with an AI generated voice and it just can use vision and it detect what that thing is and now we have chat GPT so like Pokemon already knew about this thing 20 years ago in the Pokédex and now I'm just thinking how can I build my own Pokedex so a pokedex essentially I can break it down into steps like one is you take a photo number two is you send that photo to an AI and it tells you a description of what that item is three you save that photo in the description four you generate a voice or you use an AI voice model to describe what that is in audio form rather than in just text and then five you like save it to a database and so that's kind of like a Pokedex for real life but it's mapping out those steps and then creating visuals for each one of those steps you can break down a complex problem and just make it happen essentially and it's kind of the mindset I bring towards programming I guess yeah and do you use any like formal system like Universal modeling language uml or anything like that when you're like trying to diagram these things out or how do you uh how do you actually like wire everything together in your mind and on paper before you actually start building do you and do you do all that before you actually start building yeah know I I don't know like I I never learned any of these paradigms or these Frameworks so I just I just brainstorm it out and then I just draw it and then I just build it yeah but um visually like that seems to work really well and I can oh I think my camera's going there there we go um okay like from my point of view from working on early concepts of ideas I've had to working in business to now making content on YouTube that's always worked really well the only one thing I haven't done is worked in large teams of like maybe 50 to 100 developers working on like a huge repo I don't know if you would need some sort of um proper Frameworks in mind for that kind of stuff but for the kind of stuff I'm working on it's always worked perfectly fine yeah and so collaborating with teams in my opinion like that is a completely different skill set than just being like a solo developer and like being your own product manager and uh being your own developer your own designer like you the most efficient number of people to have on a team is always going to be one because there's like none of that communication overhead you don't need to formalize everything the way that it can be Community yeah yeah quick and dirty as you said yeah exactly uh so so like people take for granted like how difficult it is to get an entire team on the same page and convey an idea that like the Visionary person on the team who has this vision for the product like but when you're doing things yourself whatever system works for you works for you right like you don't need to feel like oh damn I don't knowl I'm not a real you know developer if I don't knowl uh because I can't actually do all the fancy like squares and stuff like they do in the movies you know um but but the reality is um yeah whatever works works and it sounds like your you know your brutal pragmatism is on Full display in terms of how you kind of mock these projects up y before building them out and um I'd say the same thing happens to a lot of things in real life um so my wife for example start up a nail salon and so you'd normally for a business to get you know a loan from the bank they want like a business plan and all this stuff and we just did it step by step oh my camera's gone again there s yeah don't worry about okay it's back it's out that's mindset that I have where I'm building a application I said let's do the same for the nail salon let's just map up all right we need a location we need nail stock we need you know some equipment to get it up and running and then we just start advertising and getting people to come in and anything along the way we just buy as we need and so we're able to do that and build a nail salon from scratch so um I'd say a lot of things in life even like when I had my son like there is no plan for that sometimes like you have to kind of learn as you go yeah absolutely like there's no book how to be a great parent I'm sure there are tons of books by way I'm sure there are books for it but but like I mean really it's like an experiential thing it's like there's like there is no book I would have learned to code and and get a developer job except there is that I wrote yay um just Google learn to code book but like that's just my opinion man like like yeah correct in practice there's going to be so many different things so many different like things that are specific to your circumstances and everything like that and they're going to be similar like with building a nail salon or building you know a PO pokeddex for real life uh whatever your project may be you know to some extent you have to rely on your instincts and you have to uh just accept that like hey if I was able to accomplish something there is some validity in how I accomplished it even if looking back it seems like I was just flying by the seat of my pants and had no idea what I was doing the proof is in the pudding right like yeah or the proof the proof of the pudding is in the eating right if the if the pudding is edible you must have done something right right it's not like radioactive you know sludge that is like making people throw up and stuff it's pudding right so you know you kind of have to feel through but but I just want to say like love yourself love respect yourself respect what you've accomplished and don't feel like oh I'm just like a dirty hack who just like you know slaps things together with no Grace or Elegance um you know you'd be amazed at how many of the projects out there are kind of tacked together like famously since we talked about Microsoft and Doss earlier okay yeah have you ever uh have you ever wondered why they jump straight from Windows 8 to Windows 10 and why there's no Windows 9 um I thought nine just didn't seem like a good number so they skipped it what I heard was because they had like Windows 95 Windows 98 Windows you know they had like all these different parts of the Microsoft codebase referenced Windows 95 because they didn't imagine like oh we'll just do a full rewrite when we create some future version but no they just keep piling more and more code so if you use like Windows 11 it probably has a whole lot of Windows 95 code in there uh that's what I've heard I haven't actually inspected the code base and I don't think it's open source so I don't think I can maybe they've open sourced some of the old versions but um they didn't want to risk having references to Windows 9x because they might have used like regular expressions or any number of things and it would just add all this complexity so like hey I have an idea let's just skip to Windows 10 and uh maybe people won't notice that we skip Windows 9 because we don't want to spend you know developer years hunting through this massive codebase trying to identify all the situations where having a Windows 9 could clash with Windows 95 or Windows 98 you know so yeah remember that they said they would yeah I remember they said they would never stop after like they would stop after 10 and there would just be updates after that but then there was 11 and yeah you know but you're right like I think sometimes you don't know what's happening behind the scenes and some things are made with duct tape and sticky tape but they're held together and they somehow work and on the front end everything looks pretty exactly yeah nobody get nobody goes and sees what like how the sausage is made so to speak they just see the uh result in you know if you're not a vegetarian the resulting sauce is just you know very delicious right so um yeah it sounds like to some extent you're just you and your wife are just feeling your way through building this nail salon and you similarly are feeling your way through becoming a prominent YouTube Creator uh becoming a developer uh I mean it sounds like your first day is on the job you know where you were like using all these tools and figuring out all these new things and you know bringing your your own curiosity to the Forefront and applying it to find inventive ways of Saving Time and getting things done faster it sounds like that that you you I mean the vibe I get from you is that you're just you're unashamed of the hackness yeah no I'm not I I think it's part of the process that a lot of people need to see that you know things aren't written perfectly in code every single time and those early videos I did had old the mistakes and how I problem solve those mistakes along the way as well and so I think that was an important an part of it then on top of that I don't think I've ever personally had impostor syndrome cuz I suppose I started at the very bottom and I just I assumed I don't know anything and so I very upfront that I don't know anything and then even when I'm teaching Concepts it's me not knowing about something and discovering it and showing that journey and so for me it's always been a very natural part of how I present I guess yeah and I am similar and that I did have some imposter syndrome but I just assumed like I knew nothing and that like I'm you know some 30yearold guy who's waiting into this field that people have already been coding for like 20 years because they started when they were kids and they were in like high school programming club and Robotics club and stuff like that and uh I just assumed that I was surrounded by people that were more experienced more capable than me and like okay let's take as a given that those people are you know more capable than me what can I do is there still a place for me to get things done and so you know just finding things that I can practically do to help yeah so I have a lot of questions that we haven't even gotten to because we've had so many exciting things to talk about uh you you have like of course uh you know your YouTube channels um code code x x yeah like codex like a like a book as opposed to a scroll a book that has like binding early open AI model for coding codex yeah oh okay so um one of the things you do is you are an AI evangelist which sounds like almost like an apocalyptic role maybe you can talk about what you do as an AI evangelist um I'd say it's less about um playing around with all the AI tools and more just thinking like what Cool Tools should devs know about like what are cool AI things that are going to make your life a bit easier if you're coding if you're making websites if you're designing because it's kind of like suddenly a year skipped by and there's dozens and dozens of new tools out there that compete with Adobe and figma and they compete with Photoshop to generate stuff that wasn't capable like the most recent one I've seen and um I can't really say it'll help developers but it helps me is like there's music generation with AI now and these songs that it generates means that I don't have to worry about you know um having copyright music or anything it's a beautiful song made in two seconds from a single prompt in two seconds you get anything you want you if you want like instrumentals if you want Loi if you want um synth it's all there and you just describe what you want like I want um a song about the Roman Empire and you can even have lyrics in there and the lyrics sound like a real person you can even specify what the lyrics say and it turns it into the song so it's it's amazing and that's just like one tool out of many my friend sent me one of those the other day it was like taking about using the restroom on the clock it wasn't exactly like that but like the best 45 minutes of my life you know like getting paid to use the restroom basically and I'm not saying exactly what the lyrics are very crass song but uh yeah it was I I was like wow like did a human really not play a part in writing the lyrics of this I mean you could tell there was artifacts and if you're a musician you can listen and you can be like okay like this is like the most generic you know chord progression or this is like the most generic like drum Tempo or it sounds like they it's just like you threw a bunch of stuff in a blender it doesn't seem original but it is technically original in the way that like a string of text coming from GPT technically if you plug that into Google uh it's extremely improbable that that exact sentence will have occurred before even though you know it's trained on you know but I could see as a Creator just not wanting to worry about copyright strikes that was a huge headache uh anytime you're using any sort of recorded music unless you're doing a Channel about music where you need to like actually use excerpts from music to talk about it uh which should be fair use but even like Rick biato and a lot of the big uh YouTube creators that are in the music space complained about like let Zeppelin I can't even play the the first three notes from cop yeah it's crazy but um it it is a thing and so now ai is coming and solving a lot of problems like even there's an AI website called reloom Ai and what it does is it makes wireframes using Ai and all you do is type in a prompt I I want a website for a nail salon and it creates all the wireframes it creates all the text and sometimes it can even do the visuals for you and it takes like 5 Seconds to create you the concept out for different websites and you can regenerate them so like they're just making the process of building a website a lot faster yeah and um what are some of the other types of AI tools you use and and I do want to get more into like your formal job as an AI like that's on your LinkedIn AI evangelist like is it I didn't even know that I think so I mean I just looked at your LinkedIn a minute ago and I saw that it like jumped out of me you been like I didn't even know yeah yeah well it's it's not your job to like stay on top of LinkedIn when you're m mostly it sounds like you're just working on your own yeah working with like uh you do sponsorships and stuff with uh one um so that Ai and uh version you're talking about was there's a company in West Australia that does um they're called generative and um they do AI project so as I was getting requests for Consulting in AI I would forward them on to these guys ah okay so basically like people come to you all the time probably asking you about AI I had hundreds of emails yeah it was insane especially you basically just like help kind of triage those and steer those to people that actually do contract work in the space correct yes okay that that makes sense so that was what I was referring to when I said AI it's literally originally I I didn't know where to send people and you know that like you don't want to recommend someone when you don't know if that company is any good um you want to actually like meet a few people and actually recommend someone who you trust and know will do the thing properly so like in this case I finally found someone in Australia that does it and so that's why I've been recommending people to that company yeah so that that is like a a heartening note if for any of you out there listening that are really interested in like a specific kind of vertical of technology or something like that eventually you may become so authoritative in that space that you're turning away work and you can get paid to send that work to somebody else who actually has the bandwidth to do that work um yeah it sounds like an enviable position that you've uh established for yourself so um you in addition to being like the the AI guy the low code guy um on YouTube like the one of the serious creators in the space who has a computer science degree and has worked as a developer and as an IT guy for like you know nearly two decades it sounds like like you're somebody who actually uh you know has built out that expertise and that reputation over the years um but in addition to that you also have as I said earlier like serious design skills um and you you've created like a web design road map for example can you talk about your relationship with design yeah sure um when I was doing a lot of the websites to begin with um obviously I didn't have a designer so I had to design them myself so while I was staying ahead of all the programming stuff that was happening I was always staying ahead with all the design stuff that was happening because I was just designing my own ideas so I was always very ahead of the bleeding edge almost of design and over time I learned all the concepts that make a good website look good I was always having a look at like redesigned Concepts for like Facebook or Google or Reddit even and making my own variations on that just as a hobby and over time when I did my YouTube channel I thought well why not like I I started my YouTube channel doing like just websites doing some basic HTML then I grew it out to like other things in programming to react and node and then I thought why not grow it out to design as well but I noticed YouTube punished me when I created content for programming and design cuz they're almost two completely different subjects it's why I created that separate Channel called codex for design and kept programming separate on um on my Adan TW Channel but I did like in um teaching those Design Concepts and I never had any courses or anything like that and I S thought to myself one of the best things I can do is create a course for design so I have my own course that people can learn these fundamentals what especially developers who never learn any design so I made a course called um enhance UI or teach me um design which was specifically designed for developers coming in because I knew the developer mindset I thought I would go through all those fundamentals of like topography and color theory and stuff that I learned over the years but more in a Programming type fashion so I started doing this course and I thought it would take me like a month to do then I thought it would take me half a year to do then I thought it would take me a year to do and I continued to make it and make it and make it and then I teamed up with a guy called George um and we continued to build it and end up being like over 400 pages is long because there's obviously just so many concepts for design but I ended up releasing it almost a year and a half down the track and design is luckily one of those things that never changes like color theory has been around for 100 years good topography will never change while different fonts will be popular the fundamentals for that will always be the same I thought if I do it properly and do it once well it'll always be there so unlike react or nextjs every year there's a new version you have to relearn the course or something like that even JavaScript new modules out there design is one of those things that I can make it right the first time and everyone will benefit forever essentially if you learn that course it'll benefit forever into the future from doing it and so I built that course it's called enhance UI um if you go to enhance ui.com right now you can visit it and um and yeah it's doing really well I did like a um I also did a video on every single chapter of that book um so it's like a full on book full on video video course and now I've got exercises and workshops in there and I'm continuously building it out and improving it every year now that I've got it out yeah it's really cool that you it's like a living document and there's like a community around it uh you you have a Discord for it that people join so yeah I've created a Discord I've called that um Discord merge um and I just thought I need to have a different name from codex so I'm slowly creating a new channel called merge as well um on YouTube I third Channel um cuz merge sounds more like a um a thing where I'm talking about design because you're merging code with design so that was my mindset behind it um and yeah if you had to merge I've got a huge community on there and what I do is also I do free design reviews so if you have a website I review it I go over like what you can do to improve it um I'm sharing all these things like the AI tools about how you can create wireframe designs um so that's kind of like the the mindset behind that Community anyway yeah and uh I think it's so cool that you're like so committed to this field of design that you just kind of stumbled into as a developer like as you said you just had to kind of like learn this stuff to in order to be able to do a better job as a developer working on different contracts you know uh obviously like the usability and things like that uh are are important in the functionality but what it looks like the actual Aesthetics are important and you know people care about Aesthetics and what is a Aesthetics what is good typography what is you know like design hierarchy what are a lot of these different concepts well a lot of that stuff was cemented in the kind of like advertising age of like the you know 30s 40s 50s 60s if you've seen Mad Men like one of my favorite shows of all time like they're they're just constantly talking about these things and they're like steeped in that culture of uh what is going to catch the eye what's going to hold attention what's going to be legible if you read uh there's a book uh gosh who is the guy that the big Advertiser guy that uh Ogie Ogie on Ogie his book and he talks about how like they have like this ad for like Volkswagen bug that they've used for like 30 years and they never changed it because it just it works it converts like and why does it work you know and and like trying to understand strip that down to the nuts and bolts and understand the actual design considerations um so just like with like free C Camp and Mathematics where huge Advocates of learning mathematics and Mathematics doesn't really change it's been like more or less the same for the last 2,000 years and then people have layered some additional stuff on it it's one of those skills that if you like really learn it properly you don't have to keep coming back to it right uh you could you just for the rest of your life you have that toolbox for uh you know understanding what is good design and being able to create things on the Fly and being able to recognize good design in other things uh so this this sounds like a really cool book and and a really cool course yeah um and a while back you sent me like a book that was like one of the most beautiful I guess selfpublished books like it I'd never seen a book where every page looked so you know deliberated upon uh yeah can you tell me a little bit about that book is that the same book yeah it is it's um originally I got inspired by someone called um Chris doe he runs a channel called the future it's a Design Channel and so he wrote a book and it was just like his own kind of personal book about himself but what he did in that book was every page on its opposite side had a beautiful visual he had created in his you know life and it was like a design image and so I thought if I'm going to create this book for developers and I want to teach a a concept about color theory how about I create a beautiful visual for every single one of these Pages it's one of the reason the book is like 400 Pages um plus it's because 200 pages is the content and the other 200 pages are the beautiful visuals that explain or represent that Visual and so if you've ever followed uh George mher on Twitter you might have also seen he's done a lot of those visuals as well on like things like react and stuff if you can visually show someone like a folder structure in a beautiful way it's a lot more appealing than if you just see a snapshot of vs code and so that's the mindset I brought into creating the book so that I wanted the experience of reading it to be almost like a very nice one I've got like motiv quotes in there from aspiring artists to like beautiful visuals that represent um things like the topography itself so that you can see as well as read the content yeah yeah that's so cool and I'm just curious like how much time does it take like what tools do you use to lay that out by the way you so I actually got the proper in design from Adobe and I build that up properly as a published book that can be then later on printed and I've done a dark version and a light version I just haven't gone through the process of seeing if I can get it printed on Amazon yet but that is like one of the steps I want to do in the future too yeah I mean you you can basically take any book and put it on Amazon and they can print it now whether it's going to be like this fancy bound kind of like coffee table book like there are books that cost 50 bucks 100 bucks right like Getty Lee put out a book about the electric bass right and I was like oh man that'd be amazing but I'm not spending like I don't know much the book is it's like 100 bucks Getty Lee book base if you don't know who Getty Lee is he's the uh the Bas player for Rush and he's yeah it's it's a $50 Hefty book probably weigh several pounds I may get one I may get a copy I love bass um but like if if you wanted to print like an actual like thick uh 400 page like nice paper quality book that's going to sit on somebody's coffee table or going to sit on a bookshelf behind somebody like me me wink nudge nudge wink wink if you do print one and you ship it to me I will put it on the the bookshelf behind me I've been looking for good books to put on there um you may need to go to a special publisher for that uh or you may be able to do like I don't know if anybody still does kickstarters but something like that to to get the publication of it uh but I'd be very interested in having a physical copy at some point um and I think a lot of people listening for this would be too because I love design and I've spent so much time at bookstores just flipping through different books on like Design Concepts and things like that that are just very beautifully crafted and uh like a lot of times they'll be like really weird shapes like they'll be really giant or really small and you like flip through them and they find all these creative ways to illustrate the different concepts and and I had lots of friends uh when I was in college who were designers as well so like yeah it's it's a field of personal interest for me even though like if you look at free C Camp we have like an extremely like almost brutalist if you're familiar with like the brutalist movement of Architecture is like bare concrete you know like it it's free C Camp is very much uh simple and like we don't we don't do anything fancy like we we just like exactly what you know uh inspired by that kind of pragmatic like practical like we I I call it command line Chic uh because I was trying to like recreate the feel of being in a command line like uh maybe like MS DOS era whenever you're like doing a Bo or something I said let's let's redesign your website cuz I could make it you know look good but you're like you like it to be that brutalist style cuz I've actually redone um like I've even done Jesse or code stacker like a design course on sorry no I think he has a vs course super code superhero like I've done a few designs for for a couple of the creators but uh if you ever want a free code C freesign you should do a course like like let's redesign free Coke camp like maybe we can incorporate some of the ideas uh yeah like a lot of the the reason free C Camp looks the way it is is because we have a lot of people accessing us with like very limited data everything has to be really high performance we we use very few images um but here's where like you use a little bit of smarts of like can we do a super fast speed test on their connection within the very first 2 point seconds of the um load and if it's a slow connection you give them a l slow lowy version of the website if they got B connection bu so those are that's how I think I'm like how can I revent this to give them that and you you find that that's what the news websites do right they actually have a lowfi and a highf five version and the LOI is actually for their SEO so when Google and crawlers hit their website they get a very fast Snappy website with have all the article you go on there and you have a 100 videos and ads everywhere and you can't even read the article so it's like how how are they even indexing it so yeah there's tricks around that interesting yeah I had even thought about that but yeah if you because everything you do is like slightly adding to the time but if you can do it fast enough everybody can have a decent experience and and people who have you know I've got like 500 megabits here in Texas like we're we're spoiled here in the United States and so I could easily go to like the most multimedia intensive website and I probably wouldn't even notice the load time uh and I I imagine a lot of people listening are in like South Korea or some place like that that has ridiculously fast internet too um okay so uh I am really interested in talking about the the pandemic a little bit just because you made such heavy use of that uh what were some things that you did to really capitalize on the fact that so many people are getting online all at the same time like Freo camp we experienced a dramatic surge in usage which unfortunately it's kind of like tapered off because you know people uh a lot of people uh their ambition was bigger their eyes were bigger than their stomach and once they actually started coding and like getting into it they're like I can't do this for the rest of my life uh but a lot of people state of course so like I think most websites I know like learning websites and then down but like the Baseline is like twice as high as it was before the pandemic maybe you can talk about uh yeah what yeah um what you did I didn't particularly tackle the pandemic from a business point of view to like get the YouTube channel working really well I think at that point in time was when I started YouTube and I saw some small guy called Flor and Pop um and he he published this blog saying that he's going to make 30 videos in 30 days and I'm like that's easy I'll make 300 video or 365 videos in a year and so that's where I had that idea to to make a video every single day and while I didn't make 365 videos I think 300 is a pretty good success rate um for videos in the year and I suppose that was the mindset I went into it like I I kind of treated it as as as a challenge but whether I got subscribers or not wasn't the goal my goal was like can I make a better video than what's online right now and that's a good goal because that's measurable you can't control how many people subscribe to your video like I see people all the time make the mistake like I'm just going to get to a thousand followers on like Instagram or on on YouTube or wherever and they make the goal some sort of number that's completely outside of their control but what you did is you like every video is going to be 1% better and that's subjective but like you did have the concrete goal of I'm going to publish a video every day for 300 days that is something control that I contr control making a good video I couldn't control if it gets views or subscribers and that didn't matter to me at all yeah so to some extent it was just like brute forcing your way to Brilliance like spending a lot of time and energy yeah creating videos and and that process was where you were honed so to speak correct so let's say hypothetically somebody was starting today knowing what you know today if you had like zero we presence and maybe you didn't even have the skills that you have currently would you do the same thing would you just dive in and just start building would and if you have a look at like one of the popular people out there Josh tried coding that's what he did and if you have a look he's having a lot of success but if you watch his early videos that's quite him learning how to code and then sharing what he's learned step by step by step and while it was very raw at the beginning you can see his improvement over time and it's very personal and very genuine yeah so um one of the things that you've said that uh is that even with AI tools you still need to know the fundamentals uh that that like you know tooling is never a replacement for actual comprehension of what's going on under the hood and like being a fundamentals what are the fundamentals that you would encourage web developers to learn in 2024 I think and this is what I recommend still to anyone who ask me they want to start coding I actually do Point them to a free code count and I say learn the responsive web design course where you learn HTML CSS in JavaScript because that is the best um way to enter into learning to code it's got like really good tests and examples and it really teaches you that kind of stuff so like I think that's one of the like the the easiest most like there isn't a pay wall behind it either so yes I funny enough you have put together a really good resource for that one yeah uh so so is there any like other big skills like would you consider design a skill that's got to have or would you consider like a i' Sayce to design is something you can look at after you start building websites once you're in there and you're building content um for yourself or for companies then you can start looking at design so I wouldn't say oh do my design calls first and then learn to code because that's not going to serve you as well learning to code will probably serve you really well if that's what you want to do obviously if you don't want to be a coder and you just want to learn design do my design course of course yeah awesome and let's talk about low code and no code so a lot of people a lot of developers especially are like ah they Gran every time you they hear low code or no code just like people might have grown when they heard Microsoft front page when they were building their own websites uh back in or Dream Weaver or something like that that like tries to simplify this you know more like high touch uh process of artisanally crafting a website rather than just you know throwing a bunch of templates together right um how would you describe no code how is it different from low code and then like maybe give me like an idea of for whom those are useful so I would hope that most people that are developers have used figma before because often developers and programmers are converting figma designs into code and figma is a full design piece of software it's almost like Photoshop and I think no code is getting to the point where you can drag and drop and create a visual design and it's already coded that's B basically it you don't have to worry about writing any boxes you don't have to worry about any alignment you just drag it into place and it's right there and I've seen the Stepping Stones of these where like originally you could drag an element um in um with Elementor or weo and then you still have to code out like the padding and everything like that you have to understand those principles of like how HTML works and how sections work and how divs work and it's slowly move like the no code movement is slowly moving away to that to quite literally you do not have to know what's happening under the hood you just drag the elements into how you want them to look and it just it just works so that's what I find really interesting because I wonder like how much coding will be involved in the future besides building the functionality under the hood and this is where like the low code no code will be like visuals are built by designers and then fun functionality built is built by programmers and there's almost going to be a separation between the two at some stage I think interesting so you think that like right now like a lot of web developers do their own design work as well but you do think that things are going to become more Specialized or do you think that like low code tools will allow a mediocre designer to do design work so they can focus on the development work and vice versa for like a mediocre developer I do think that program focus on yeah I do think that programmers and designers will be using no code tools in the future for any marketing company or um web company because it's just easier faster and um better in all manner like you can build a where I used to build websites in two weeks down to like a week down to four days you can use no code to do that in four hours so if it it takes you four hours and you have a website that's secure and looks exactly the same and it's responsive and now you can update it in seconds rather than hours it's a nobrainer for any business in that point of view right and so that's where like a lot of the industry for business is moving that way so if you want to do that of course there's still functionality in businesses that build applications that integrate with AI or do different things with cameras or whatever it is and so for that programmers need to understand the fundamentals you can't particularly have no code tools jump in that easily you usually have to build web web apps and that's where a lot of the programmers will probably be going in that that regard yeah yeah that's definitely like uh I've seen a lot of programmers who are resistant to using those tools almost like like John Henry like I can drive spikes faster than this damn machine you know like that kind of like mentality but at the same time like a lot of them are like well I I use it for this or I use it for that and the number of things they use it for may be slowly growing and it's not necessarily going to replace that developer instinct or the designer eye or things like that but it does you know provide additional leverage so that you can use what you know and your your expertise to get things done faster right I like to think of it as farming right a farmer might go to you and say I can use my hands to scoop out a hole and put a seed in there and pack the Earth in perfectly so why I not always use my hands the next farmer might go oh I have a tool to plow and then a tool to like throw the seeds in there and a tool to compress it so why not use those tools then the next farmer might go I have a machine that does a thousand of these and the seeds for a thousand things and does the um articulations for a thousand of these and then the next farmer goes well I have an AI that does an entire acre for me and all I click is start and it does all the seeding all the watering and everything so at each stage a farmer still needs to understand the um fundamentals but it doesn't mean that the farmer who's manually digging out the soil and putting one seed in there is doing it any better or worse it just means the tools now are kind of Greater and if you want to use ize them sure you can you might have more success and from a business point of view it makes sense but it doesn't take away from the fact that you know how to do that either yeah let's talk about AI tools because sure obviously you're an AI evangelist and you know a lot about AI tooling and you've been working with these since before before it was cool right uh back when you were like one of the few people who who cared to use these you know at the time very limited tools um what AI tools do you use kind of like currently like uh can you maybe rattle off some tools that you use maybe every week I think my dayto day the most I use is obviously GitHub copilot it allows me to autocomplete any programming code that I'm trying to figure out which is it's useful it's very useful I do use chat GPT for uh brainstorming so if I have like questions or I'm trying to almost treated like a psychologist where I'm trying to figure out what I'm trying to say or do it helps me kind of brainstorm in that regard um and then I also use um I have 11 Labs it's not really programming but it replicates my voice to such a degree that people can't recognize when I use the AI voice in my own voice and sometimes in videos or in content I can just use that right up a script and suddenly I've already said the script which is great yeah and I've talked with like Andrew Brown in a previous episode Andrew Brown exam Pro creator of many uh tutorials and he actually has like a degenerative voice condition so he makes heavy use of AI uh Speech synthesis tools and Freo Camp has a course coming up soon that will teach you how to uh to like kind of wrap your voice around like a you know a like a newscast or whatever other piece of audio to make it sound like you're saying it or you can speak different languages it's very cool without having actually put in the time to actually learn that's cool call me old school but I really enjoy learning languages and I will continue to do that though I'll probably never have time to like learn German for example so uh this will be a convenient tool if I need to like you know ever pretend that I can speak German or or Just Dub videos into German uh so it sounds like you're do you actively like follow what what is your information diet like how do you stay up on all the development in AI this very fast moving field I don't know I just think my feed tells me whether it is on Tik Tok or Google news or um YouTube or Reddit like just seem to stumble across these things and um if they're not getting much traction of his ability I like to create video content on it too so yeah yeah that's very cool so you're just out there you're just like consuming and reading you don't have like some carefully curated like RSS feed uh like that that is like exactly what you want to be learning uh I mean do you listen to like particular podcasts or anything like that to stay up on things no no podcasts I technically like I don't read the newspaper I don't really check out Reddit um like for the most part it's just somehow the algorithms on Google News tell me the Google News algorithms are pretty good in that regard yeah that's very cool so um I guess there's like you know in terms of productivity and something like just not taking the time to try to curate an information diet and just relying on algorithms to serve up good stuff it seems to be working for you yeah yeah for sure for sure awesome and just like a final kind of like question about like AI tool Tooling in general uh let's say you had a new client like maybe you can talk about how developing like a you know a marketing website for like somebody's got like some pharmaceutical product or something they want to create a website for that what would that process look like when you were first starting and what would that process look like today maybe you can just walk us through from memory what it used to be like and now what you would do if you had suddenly a job like that it's a good question I guess uh in the past um I would actually have a graphics designer so like the salesperson would kind of um make the sale their Graphics designer would put together all the assets in Adobe XD and then I would sit down and using Wordpress I would spend two weeks almost or like a week just writing out every template file for the homepage for all the subpages the headers the Footers writing out all the HTML writing out all the CSS I think I'd have like 5 to 10,000 lines of CSS maybe 5 to 10,000 lines of HTML and then I would spend a week like I would spend days doing all the responsive design and I would spend days um testing for all the bugs that would happen and eventually I'd pass that back to the designer there'd be new mockups I'd have to revise that design um and finally ship it to you know back to the sales guy who would present it to the client whereas now like I can sit down in a day and build it with the client in front of him just Dragon droing elements or premade templates and moving the about and putting his con um his work straight in there in front of him and even show him how to do that so that if he needs to make changes I don't have to do them every single time either so it's a completely different process wow that's dramatic so going from something that might take like an entire month of going back and forth have lots of parties involved to you literally being able to interface directly with the client right in front of them and build it out how would that affect billing if they're like oh this only took you like you know a few hours to build this website like how much do you think you could charge versus how much you used to be able to charge well if someone said they can build you a house rather than in a year they can do it for you in a month does that make the house more valuable or less valuable now that you don't have to pay for your mortgage for the rest of the year and you can move in objectively that doesn't that doesn't have any sort of I mean it makes the house more valuable for sure but traditionally have looked at work is like like there's that that old uh anecdote about Picasso right so Picasso is sitting in a cafe and uh This Woman's like oh Picasso can you draw something for me and he he takes out a you know pen and a piece of paper he's like does like one of his beautiful like oneline paintings like where he draws like the Wiener Dog with a single line from a pen and it takes it's just a few quick strokes and it takes a few seconds and she's like this is amazing thank you and he says that'll be $5,000 and she's like what $5,000 it only took you a few minutes and and he's like yes but it took me 60 years to become Picasso yeah right that's exactly it that's how things work and that's how value is created in the world but that's not how people are used to thinking it most people would be like that lady and they'd be like shocked like really you want thousands of dollars for what took you that much time but you as a developer as a designer uh as you know essentially a product manager uh have uh built this skill set you've learned how to use all these tools um like how much would you charge like in theory if somebody wanted like I'm not sure if anybody in the audience actually would want to pay your hourly or whatever but like if you were to sit down with somebody and build something right in front of them to their specifications what would that cost now versus what what might it have cost to have that entire mon as I said before it used to cost about $2,000 to do in a week or two now it cost about $20,000 but I can get it done in a day and if you think about it I I always like to get the metaphor of like imagine you have a problem with your tooth it's a pain you know like a business pain right it's a pain in your tooth and you need a root canal now imagine having a to wait two months for a root canal and you have to come in five times for five surgeries for a root canal and by the end of it you spend half a year and $10,000 for a root canal I give you a procedure that takes a day and gets rid of that root canal for like you know about the same cost and it doesn't cause you any pain whatsoever would that not be more valuable to you than going through all that dentist pain and so that's the business mindset that uh business owners think about because for them their website means they're getting less conversions every day it's not working is that pain of a tooth essentially yeah that's a great way of framing it um and like what advice would you give to somebody who's doing like freelance development work and doing design work and potentially learning these tools so they can do what you do or they can sit down with the client like what advice would you give to them as as far as broaching that with a client who might already have it in their mind but it would only took you a few hours like I mean the ruk canal analogy of course something like yeah I would say go on YouTube search up Chris do Chris Doo um from the future and he has thousands of videos on how to talk with clients on exactly this subject to showcase the value of what you're building rather than just the hours that you're working yeah awesome man well that that is a great advice and I will look him up and I'll include a link to him in the show notes Adrian it's been so amazing catching up with you thanks for staying up late uh and just uh sharing your many insights with the community I hope everybody tuning in has learned a great deal from Adrien I hope you'll uh check out his his book hope you'll check out some of his you know free Cod Camp courses he's got a epic you know wire Framing and like development I think you use figma you may use some other tools in that video course that we published a while back uh are we going to get some new videos from you in the future yeah I think so I've got um some plugs in the roots oh sorry in the works and I've got some video content that I'm doing for the enhanced UI book so I'll see if I can maybe turn that into like a five hour long course for you guys cuz the minimum amount of time usually for a video of yours well I again I've learned so much from you over time uh and I'm continuing to learn like just over the past hour and a half I've learned a tremendous amount from you and it it's so refreshing to hear your perspective because I don't think you're a contrarian and you're like thinking differently from everybody else just to stand out I think you just have the most kind of pragmatic perspective on getting things done and it's so refreshing it's like you're like the least dogmatic person I've ever talked to in this field probably like all right well that's good to hear yeah it's great so um yeah well thank you again and for everybody uh listening to this I hope you enjoyed learning from Adrien and uh until next week happy coding thanks say yeah
