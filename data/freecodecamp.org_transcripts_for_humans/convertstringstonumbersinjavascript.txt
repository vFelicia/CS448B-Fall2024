00:00 - in JavaScript you can convert a string
00:02 - to a number very easily let's see five
00:05 - options first number you pass a string
00:09 - as an argument and you get a number with
00:11 - parse in you can also specify the base
00:14 - of the numeral system of the string for
00:16 - example two would be binary math of
00:19 - floor is another option but it returns
00:22 - an integer the original number rounded
00:24 - down to the nearest integer math. seal
00:27 - is equivalent but it rounds up to the
00:29 - nearest integer and let's see if you
00:31 - knew about this option if you write the
00:33 - unary plus operator before the string
00:36 - you can convert that string to a number
00:39 - of course for all of these options the
00:41 - string must represent a number otherwise
00:44 - you will get n a n which means not a
00:47 - number
