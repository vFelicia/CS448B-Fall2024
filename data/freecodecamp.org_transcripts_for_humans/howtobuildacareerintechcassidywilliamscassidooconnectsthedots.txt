00:12 - out with us today
00:13 - thank you for having me i'm excited i am
00:16 - just tickled pink you uh you chose to
00:19 - come and join us on here i think this is
00:20 - gonna be an absolute blast um
00:23 - so i mean
00:24 - i i feel like you're one of the people
00:26 - who needs no introduction but maybe we
00:28 - should do just for the the sake of
00:30 - anyone who's been living under a rock or
00:33 - doesn't go on twitter or isn't familiar
00:35 - with tick tock um
00:37 - you want to give a little bit of an
00:38 - introduction for yourself
00:39 - hello everyone i exist
00:42 - um uh i'm a
00:45 - i'm a dev experienced engineer with
00:47 - jason at netlify i make beams on the
00:49 - internet
00:51 - and
00:52 - that's really the high level thing i
00:54 - could i could go into more detail but i
00:56 - figure we will throughout this whole
00:57 - thing yeah i think that's
01:00 - that's our whole goal today so um for
01:02 - everyone in the chat thank you so much
01:04 - for hanging out with us today the the
01:06 - goal of what we want to talk about today
01:08 - is um
01:10 - like the premise for the show is that i
01:11 - think
01:12 - a lot of people are looking for work
01:14 - right now it's been a hard year uh tech
01:16 - is getting busier and busier there are
01:18 - more and more people who are are moving
01:20 - into the field through boot camps
01:21 - through traditional means through
01:23 - non-traditional means just studying on
01:25 - their own um
01:27 - and that means that there are a lot of
01:28 - folks who are trying to get that first
01:30 - role and so what we want to do on the
01:32 - show is talk to people like yourself who
01:34 - have a
01:35 - like a stellar career you know you've
01:37 - done a lot of amazing things that we'll
01:39 - talk about and you've got an amazing
01:41 - network that we'll also talk about
01:43 - but kind of rewind that a little bit and
01:45 - talk about how you got those first steps
01:47 - and how you started that journey and
01:49 - also the part that i find most
01:51 - interesting is
01:52 - when we're talking about a tech career
01:55 - what is it that we're able to bring to
01:57 - it that's not tech training so not being
02:00 - a developer not being computer science
02:02 - major but what do we bring from the rest
02:05 - of ourselves that gives us an advantage
02:07 - that gives us that opportunity to go
02:09 - further and do more with our tech career
02:12 - um
02:13 - so
02:14 - i guess to to jump right into this
02:17 - how did you like what was your journey
02:20 - from like not in tech to first tech job
02:22 - how did you how did you get started
02:25 - um so i have a very traditional
02:26 - background i actually have a cs degree
02:28 - um and studied computer science i
02:31 - started coding when i was a teenager and
02:33 - and played around with things started
02:35 - building stuff i took ap computer
02:37 - science in high school and then got uh
02:39 - got my computer science degree um but in
02:42 - college i kind of did have a shift that
02:45 - introduced me to the tech industry um
02:48 - that i think was significant where i
02:50 - started doing internships and stuff and
02:52 - and
02:53 - uh i would say probably my junior year
02:56 - was when i really started getting
02:57 - connected and that's when i started
02:58 - actually networking with people which i
03:00 - think was the biggest shift of all
03:03 - because um
03:04 - once i started going to hackathons and
03:07 - conferences and meetups and just any any
03:10 - events that i could go to and granted i
03:12 - went to iowa state university excellent
03:14 - school loved it there um but iowa is
03:16 - kind of in the middle of nowhere and so
03:18 - a lot of people think oh dang i have to
03:20 - be in san francisco to go to the meetups
03:23 - and stuff you don't you can be in the
03:25 - middle of iowa and and still go to these
03:28 - things and so um
03:29 - i i started getting connected by just
03:31 - emailing with people going to office
03:33 - hours and saying hey i heard you're
03:35 - connected with this person can i get an
03:37 - introduction just starting to kind of
03:39 - put out feelers getting involved with
03:41 - online communities and doing that just
03:44 - really opened so many doors for me where
03:46 - uh my junior year of college i was
03:48 - invited to speak at the white house and
03:49 - my sister and i both ended up speaking
03:51 - at the white house to talk about
03:53 - inclusion and technology and stuff with
03:55 - with a bunch of other uh women our age
03:58 - which was an amazing opportunity
04:00 - and people who i met there i ended up
04:03 - following up emailing them and then one
04:05 - of them ended up becoming a mentor to me
04:07 - um and then that next summer i interned
04:10 - out in silicon valley and i called it my
04:13 - summer of networking because i truly
04:14 - just i went to either a hackathon or a
04:17 - meetup at least twice a week the entire
04:20 - summer i was just concerned
04:22 - where's most people
04:24 - most people are having their summer of
04:25 - love you had your summer of linkedin
04:27 - requests
04:28 - but actually that's exactly how i
04:31 - described it i was just like i want to
04:33 - get 300 connections on linkedin this
04:35 - summer alone like i i set that as a goal
04:40 - but it's true
04:41 - i know i know it's i know it's like the
04:44 - nerdy thing to do at a summer internship
04:46 - but i it
04:47 - it changed the trajectory of my career
04:50 - really because absolutely i was able to
04:52 - get connected to so many
04:54 - cool people where one of the people who
04:56 - i met that summer ended up she's a
04:58 - mentor to me to this day and she's
05:00 - amazing and she was just someone where i
05:01 - got her business card at a hackathon and
05:03 - emailed hey it was nice to meet you and
05:06 - now she was invited to my wedding she's
05:08 - someone who i talk with regularly like
05:10 - it just happened to be that way and so i
05:13 - think i think the networking aspect is
05:16 - something that really just uh helped
05:19 - take off my career because even though
05:21 - like networking doesn't get you
05:22 - everywhere you still need to know how to
05:24 - code you still need to know how to do
05:25 - things being able to make those
05:27 - connections with people is so vital for
05:30 - just getting your foot in the door
05:32 - sometimes and and i've been able to have
05:34 - so many cool experiences because i've
05:38 - been willing to go through all of the
05:40 - emails of people who are at an event
05:41 - send a nice to meet you and just
05:44 - get to know some of those people
05:45 - absolutely and so i want to dig into
05:47 - something a little bit because
05:48 - you have this
05:50 - almost otherworldly ability to end up in
05:53 - the room you just said you know your
05:54 - junior year college you spoke at the
05:56 - white house you are
05:57 - part of a um like a react core team
06:00 - community call where you kind of talk to
06:02 - the react team about what should and
06:04 - shouldn't happen in the community and
06:05 - and you've got like you seem to be
06:07 - involved in all of the things and
06:10 - that we could just say oh well that's
06:12 - just cassidy she's special but i don't
06:14 - think that's true i think you work
06:15 - really hard at that and so i'm i would
06:18 - love to hear what what is it that you're
06:21 - doing how are you making these
06:23 - connections and and you know what what
06:25 - did you do to get that invite to the
06:26 - white house what are you doing to to get
06:28 - invited to these calls with with
06:30 - different community leaders and and you
06:32 - know to do the mc work and all of this
06:35 - you know the phrase that my mom always
06:37 - says is squeaky wheel gets the grease a
06:39 - lot of times it's just asking and being
06:42 - loud about it and stuff and so like not
06:45 - not just like getting invited to the
06:46 - white house and and
06:48 - getting invited to speak at the u.n
06:50 - getting invited to to go to all these
06:51 - cool places
06:53 - that was stuff where truly there was for
06:55 - example one of the things that i did
06:57 - that junior summer that again changed
07:00 - trajectory of my career it was a
07:01 - hackathon on a plane and it was a flight
07:03 - from san francisco to london and it was
07:06 - all of these tech leaders on the plane i
07:08 - was the only undergrad student on this
07:09 - plane and the other people were so much
07:12 - cooler than me like craig of craigslist
07:14 - was on the plane megan smith who's cto
07:17 - of the united states was on the plane uh
07:19 - just uh kimberly bryant from black girls
07:22 - code was on the plane all these really
07:23 - cool people i found out the plane was
07:25 - happening i emailed the organizers and i
07:28 - said hey i'm really interested in this
07:29 - do you have space for someone like me
07:31 - and then i like sent them my resume and
07:33 - they said actually some people just
07:35 - dropped out sure we can fill your spot
07:37 - wow that's a cooler spot like it was
07:38 - truly me just asking and if you don't
07:41 - ask you don't get really and so i a lot
07:44 - of it is
07:45 - just asking and and for example uh
07:48 - getting to know the react team and
07:50 - getting involved with with all these
07:52 - technical groups a lot of times it was
07:54 - just me sliding into the dms and saying
07:57 - hey i'm really interested in this work
07:58 - that you're doing i don't know if you
08:00 - can ever use me but i think it would be
08:02 - great to be involved in something like
08:04 - this because i'm really interested in
08:05 - the technology that you're using it
08:08 - it's small but that's something that is
08:10 - significant i remember when i was first
08:12 - in my first tech job in brooklyn and i
08:15 - would always go to the brooklyn js
08:17 - meetup and and just getting to know
08:19 - people there and uh i saw that at one of
08:22 - the events john resig was going to be
08:24 - there for those who don't know he made
08:25 - jquery i dm'd him beforehand and i just
08:28 - said hey john i saw you're going to be
08:29 - at this meet-up i hope i meet you there
08:31 - see ya left it at that and then at the
08:33 - meet-up he approached me and i remember
08:35 - i was with all my co-workers and he was
08:37 - just like hey you're the one who dm'd me
08:38 - it's so nice to meet you cassidy and
08:40 - like that was truly the interaction the
08:42 - street cred i got
08:44 - when john resig approached me but well
08:47 - it
08:48 - it was significant because because he
08:51 - approached me i got to have a
08:53 - conversation with him and then people
08:55 - who wouldn't normally talk to me
08:57 - started talking to me because they saw
08:59 - that i had this connection with someone
09:01 - who's big in the industry yeah
09:03 - and it's
09:04 - it's something that i think is
09:06 - undervalued in tech to just be willing
09:09 - to kind of put your ego at the door and
09:12 - just ask and just reach out and and talk
09:15 - to people
09:16 - you know you you brought up two things
09:18 - that i think are really interesting the
09:19 - the first one is
09:20 - it would be really easy to chalk a lot
09:22 - of this up to luck you you emailed that
09:25 - hackathon on a plane and it just so
09:27 - happened that somebody had dropped out
09:29 - and they had space right so oh lucky but
09:32 - this is i think a really good example of
09:34 - creating your own luck um
09:37 - because you know if if we look back on
09:39 - this how many of these emails have you
09:41 - sent that
09:42 - got ghosted that went nowhere where you
09:44 - gotta know
09:45 - so many
09:46 - constantly like there are sometimes
09:48 - people on twitter i'm just like i
09:49 - remember i dm'd them and they never dm'd
09:52 - me back
09:53 - and it's just like
09:54 - just oh i forgot they existed they
09:56 - probably never knew i did
09:58 - that's just
10:00 - that happens all the time but you never
10:03 - know if someone will reply i i take the
10:05 - same approach with raffles i apply to
10:07 - every raffle i enter people think i win
10:10 - a lot of raffles i've won quite a few
10:12 - things that's how i got my kindle that's
10:14 - how i got just like various lego sets
10:17 - and stuff that i have you never know if
10:19 - you could win your percentage is low but
10:22 - you could get lucky and and i kind of
10:24 - take the same approach with with that
10:26 - kind of i take the same approach with
10:27 - job uh interviews too when i was in
10:30 - college i think i applied to over a
10:32 - hundred maybe 200 jobs and people were
10:35 - just like dang you got a lot of job
10:36 - offers i'm like yeah but do you know how
10:38 - many interviews i had to go to yeah
10:42 - dozens and dozens and thousands of
10:43 - interviews and sure i had like a decent
10:46 - picking to choose from in the end but it
10:48 - was because i did so many job interviews
10:51 - yeah oh i think i mean that that is
10:55 - such an important part that i think it's
10:57 - it gets skipped a lot when we talk about
10:58 - these because you know the
11:00 - the happenstance or the chance
11:02 - encounters or the the lucky break a lot
11:04 - of times that happens because you do you
11:08 - know hundreds of job applications or
11:10 - send hundreds of of dms that go ignored
11:13 - and
11:14 - you know i i think that it can be really
11:16 - easy to to send off one job request and
11:19 - you don't hear anything back and you go
11:20 - oh i must not be any good at this and
11:22 - the fact of the matter is that like
11:25 - you're only half of the equation you're
11:26 - also waiting for someone to be at the
11:28 - right place at the right time with the
11:29 - right needs and so you have to create as
11:32 - many of those opportunities as you can
11:33 - to
11:34 - to you know be the right person at the
11:36 - right time to let people know that
11:37 - you're available so when they have that
11:39 - need they go oh i just talked to cassidy
11:41 - she's looking for this kind of work we
11:43 - should talk to her like that's you know
11:45 - though i i i always
11:48 - and maybe you'll you'll echo this but i
11:50 - feel like i hear a lot of people who say
11:52 - nothing's happening this doesn't work
11:54 - i'm never gonna make it in this industry
11:56 - and i always tell them i'm like
11:58 - look it's
11:59 - this is gonna feel like nothing's
12:00 - happening and then it's all gonna happen
12:02 - at once you just gotta keep showing up
12:05 - yeah a friend of mine actually uh was
12:08 - looking for a job for a solid year and a
12:10 - half and nothing was happening and he
12:12 - kept putting up feelers kept applying
12:13 - and stuff and he finally started his
12:15 - brand new job this week and he was so
12:17 - excited because he was finally in this
12:18 - startup and literally
12:20 - three days after he started three of
12:23 - those startups or three or four of those
12:25 - startups that he had applied to suddenly
12:27 - were just like hey we really liked
12:28 - talking to you back in the day but we're
12:30 - just now having openings and he's just
12:32 - like well that timing is
12:34 - nuts because it you know just like you
12:37 - said you never know when that timing
12:39 - will work out and so just it's a numbers
12:41 - game absolutely all kinds of
12:43 - opportunities and conversations and
12:44 - things a lot of times it's truly just
12:48 - putting it out there and seeing what
12:49 - might come back yeah um and and that
12:52 - actually i think is a nice kind of segue
12:55 - into into something i'd love to talk to
12:56 - you about in particular because i think
12:58 - that you have
12:59 - a really unique
13:01 - presence on on uh everywhere that you
13:04 - show up which is that you are
13:06 - like legitimately funny and um and i
13:10 - think that like
13:11 - it's it it was when i first met you and
13:14 - and i'm not saying that like oh i met
13:16 - you and i thought you were funny and now
13:17 - i don't but
13:19 - but when i when i first met you i think
13:21 - i would have assumed that you are just
13:23 - like a naturally funny person and that
13:26 - you know you you're just
13:28 - everything that you see you're like i've
13:30 - got a funny joke for that and you just
13:31 - you just whip off zingers all the time
13:33 - and what i've realized through through
13:35 - you actually you taught our team how to
13:38 - be funny which was i i love that um
13:41 - but you you have this approach to
13:43 - everything where you
13:45 - repeatedly try
13:47 - the same thing a little bit different
13:49 - and where you're you're tweaking
13:50 - approaches and and kind of assessing
13:52 - that can you talk a little bit through
13:55 - maybe not necessarily in humor but just
13:57 - in like your approach in general um
14:00 - how does that factor in to your career
14:02 - do you think
14:03 - yeah so
14:05 - to that between between jokes between
14:07 - project ideas between
14:09 - pretty much everything i just write
14:11 - everything down and and i have i have
14:14 - both physical notebooks i have drawings
14:16 - i have digital ones i have
14:19 - managers of all kinds of things i write
14:21 - absolutely everything down because you
14:24 - never know if something might be useful
14:26 - right and sometimes it's a code snippet
14:29 - sometimes it's just a statement
14:30 - sometimes it's look into this website
14:32 - because this might be interesting
14:33 - someday there there are so many
14:36 - things where i i'm even still on
14:38 - pinterest where i purely just put like
14:40 - projects that i might want to do someday
14:42 - just to see if something might land and
14:45 - a lot of times it's me kind of prepping
14:48 - for some day in the future that may
14:50 - never come but
14:51 - for for every joke for every tweet for
14:55 - every
14:56 - task i take on sometimes even jobs i
14:58 - might want to apply to someday i write
15:01 - them down because
15:02 - it's it's kind of i guess it's kind of
15:04 - like that second brain concept in a way
15:06 - because there are times where you might
15:08 - think of a good idea and just forget it
15:10 - and i will forget things if i don't
15:12 - write it down and and so
15:14 - just getting it down on paper helps
15:16 - remember it and then tagging things
15:18 - properly organizing yourself properly
15:20 - you never know when an idea you might
15:22 - have one day might actually be the
15:25 - perfect idea
15:27 - years later yeah
15:29 - um and and so as part of this too you
15:31 - know you're you're writing everything
15:32 - down you're keeping track of these ideas
15:34 - uh but you're also
15:36 - i would i would guess you know i know
15:37 - for for me at least when i'm trying to
15:40 - make jokes i spend a lot of time making
15:41 - jokes that are only marginally funny or
15:43 - not funny at all
15:44 - and i learn like when i try it this way
15:48 - it gets a little bit of a laugh if i
15:50 - tweak it like this it gets a lot of a
15:52 - laugh and i found similar things in my
15:54 - in my career if i build a thing like
15:56 - this people get it if i present it like
15:58 - this people kind of recoil and back away
16:01 - um
16:02 - how would you say that that sort of
16:04 - approach because i know that you're
16:06 - you're similar and that you you try
16:08 - things and tweak and try things and
16:09 - tweak how does that affect your
16:11 - confidence
16:13 - you only get more confident over time
16:16 - i think i think for example a good
16:18 - example of this is i used to teach
16:19 - workshops full-time for for react and
16:21 - stuff and when i was first teaching i
16:24 - was like man i know this material but i
16:26 - am nervous for teaching people about it
16:28 - we'll see how it goes and
16:30 - it went decently at first and i was just
16:31 - like okay you know what they asked those
16:33 - questions so i'm going to try to make
16:35 - sure this information is particularly
16:36 - clear so the next workshop it's tweaked
16:39 - ever so slightly and the more i did it
16:41 - the more the the more refined it got
16:43 - it's kind of like uh stand-up comedians
16:45 - how they want their type 10. they they
16:48 - rework a joke until it's funny enough
16:50 - that that they consistently get a laugh
16:53 - um there's this phrase that i like to
16:54 - use repetition is recognition
16:58 - try different approaches whether it's a
17:00 - coding approach a humor approach a talk
17:02 - approach a blog approach um
17:04 - you you perfect it and and practice does
17:07 - make perfect for pretty much everything
17:10 - yeah
17:11 - yeah i i think so a couple people in the
17:13 - chat are asking about um how to build
17:15 - confidence for tech interviews and would
17:18 - you say that's you know
17:20 - that's how you would recommend it or are
17:22 - there other tips that you would
17:23 - recommend 100 recommend it
17:26 - again when i said it was a numbers game
17:28 - like
17:29 - every single interview is a practice
17:31 - interview and like the i have done a lot
17:34 - of interviews i i have interviewed at a
17:36 - lot of places sometimes i interview even
17:38 - when i'm not looking for a job just
17:40 - because it's good practice and learning
17:42 - how to present yourself in an interview
17:45 - figuring out what kind of approaches do
17:47 - and don't work
17:48 - experiencing different interviewers
17:50 - where you can kind of get a vibe is this
17:52 - person someone who would kind of smirk
17:53 - if you make a self-deprecating joke or
17:56 - is this the kind of person who would
17:57 - just like be stoic you kind of figure
17:59 - out your approaches as you interact with
18:01 - all of these different interviewers and
18:03 - that really helps over time and and i
18:06 - truly think that i'm decent at
18:08 - interviewing not because i'm perfect at
18:10 - getting merge sort and the proper
18:13 - space and time complexity but because
18:16 - i've done it so many times and because
18:18 - i've interacted with interviewers so
18:19 - many times that i know how to it feels
18:22 - like gaming the system but really it's
18:24 - just practice
18:25 - absolutely yeah i found the same thing
18:27 - like the the
18:29 - one of the reasons that i run learn with
18:30 - jason is because it forces me to
18:34 - practice like i i get put into
18:36 - situations with things i don't know and
18:38 - i have to just figure it out and because
18:42 - of that i feel like my stress tolerance
18:44 - is so much higher because i just do it
18:46 - all the time and i practice doing that
18:47 - live stuff
18:48 - um so there's a question in the chat
18:52 - which i think is actually pretty
18:53 - interesting um shidanza is asking what's
18:56 - an effective way of practicing coding
18:58 - and like what sort of intermediate goals
19:01 - should you keep for that practice
19:04 - so there's there's so many different
19:07 - ways to practice coding and i guess it
19:08 - depends on your goals and i hate
19:10 - answering it depends when that is kind
19:13 - of the answer but um so so for example
19:16 - if you really want to get good at like
19:18 - a certain type of algorithm or data
19:20 - structure try implementing it in
19:22 - different languages start implementing
19:24 - it in pseudocode first implement certain
19:26 - things in pseudocode first then do it to
19:28 - python then ruby then javascript then
19:31 - java and stuff figure out how you can
19:33 - kind of solidify that information where
19:36 - it's yes you're experimenting with
19:38 - different languages but you're really
19:39 - getting used to the structure of that
19:42 - data you're really getting used to how
19:44 - that algorithm should be meanwhile if
19:46 - you're trying to really just get good at
19:48 - javascript just constantly build things
19:51 - with javascript i remember uh like i
19:53 - there was a point where i was really
19:55 - keen on maintaining my github streak and
19:57 - i had like i think was 128 days on
19:59 - github of just straight coding and a lot
20:02 - of times my projects were just
20:04 - dumb they were not they were not
20:06 - particularly useful projects i was just
20:07 - like you know what i want to just get
20:09 - good at javascript and so i just tried
20:11 - to build something with it every day and
20:13 - sometimes it was a few lines of code
20:14 - sometimes i'd get past that writer's
20:17 - block and and write a ton of code um but
20:20 - really it's just build something and and
20:23 - there's so many ideas out there to build
20:26 - and you can start with something basic
20:27 - like a to-do list a book review app
20:30 - something like that but then as as you
20:32 - practice be like a chat app a reddit
20:34 - clone
20:36 - just just keep keep kind of copying
20:38 - existing ideas while building it in your
20:40 - own unique way to to really just
20:42 - practice it and and for example i tried
20:44 - to get better at css for a long time and
20:47 - so i every single thursday i called it
20:49 - codepen thursdays i'd build something on
20:51 - codepen i'd get a design from dribble or
20:53 - something and just try to recreate it
20:55 - i'd give myself an hour sometimes it was
20:57 - not perfect but it got me practicing and
21:00 - and slowly but surely i got decent at
21:02 - css because i was practicing it enough
21:04 - and suddenly i was able to say okay well
21:07 - if i know i need to center this these
21:08 - are the three approaches i can take
21:10 - and and just go with it and so truly
21:13 - just code and it's hard to get started
21:16 - but start with something dumb and basic
21:18 - and just build up as you get ideas and
21:21 - as you get an app idea that you want to
21:22 - build write it down because then you can
21:24 - use that idea later
21:26 - yeah i and i think like what you're what
21:28 - you're mentioning too there's also
21:30 - another thing that you can do with that
21:32 - which which you talked about briefly but
21:34 - i want to dig into a little bit more
21:35 - which is you were practicing but then
21:37 - you created codepen thursdays and that
21:39 - was something you could share
21:41 - and so if you're trying to learn
21:43 - something like one of my favorite
21:45 - examples of this is lynne fisher she
21:47 - does a project called a single div and
21:50 - during october she does divtober and
21:52 - every single day she makes a css
21:55 - illustration or animation using
21:58 - just css
22:00 - most of the time in codepen and shares
22:02 - it and as a result she's built huge name
22:05 - recognition she's one of the like the
22:07 - the first people you would think of if
22:08 - you wanted to do beautiful css art you
22:11 - would go oh we need lin fisher and
22:13 - that's not because like that's not even
22:15 - her job she's like an executive at a at
22:18 - an agency or something and she just at
22:20 - least she just does this because she
22:22 - likes doing it and as a result she's
22:23 - become a leading expert on it um how do
22:26 - you feel that that sort of of
22:29 - kind of exposing your work even if it's
22:31 - not the best thing you've ever built how
22:33 - has that impacted your career do you
22:35 - think
22:36 - learning in public is huge and and i
22:39 - think i think that's something that
22:41 - a lot of people should do i know it's
22:43 - not for everybody so i don't want to say
22:45 - everyone should do this but it gets your
22:47 - name out there and sometimes that is
22:49 - that is all you need to to
22:52 - do something really well with your
22:54 - career or do some make connections that
22:57 - you need um an example of this honestly
23:00 - is my father-in-law he he's
23:03 - a 55-year-old korean man and he decided
23:05 - he wanted to learn how to code three
23:07 - years ago and so we were practicing with
23:10 - him we were helping him learn and and as
23:12 - he was building stuff he was just like
23:14 - this is really interesting to me but he
23:16 - was having trouble in interviews because
23:19 - his english wasn't so great and he was
23:21 - nervous about ageism and on all kinds of
23:23 - stuff and we said okay how about this
23:26 - start posting on twitter even if it's
23:28 - even if it's just like i built this
23:30 - today and no links or anything just
23:32 - start posting regularly so that way so
23:35 - that way your your name can be out there
23:37 - a bit and
23:38 - it worked there there was a point where
23:40 - it was he did like a hundred days of
23:42 - code where he would just say like today
23:44 - i implemented n10 tests on this or today
23:47 - today i struggled with this i don't know
23:49 - if i'll be able to get it done but i'm
23:50 - working on it that gave him practice
23:52 - writing that gave him practice
23:54 - explaining what he was working on that
23:56 - gave him the recognition of oh yeah i
23:58 - did accomplish something today and then
24:00 - when he tweeted out that he was looking
24:02 - for a job people who had been noticing
24:04 - his tweets over time he he was able to
24:06 - get on calls with them and and after
24:10 - doing the job interview process which
24:11 - took a very long time he started his
24:14 - first job this year his first software
24:15 - engineering job and he's killing it and
24:18 - it's truly just from all the practice
24:20 - and putting his name out there and and
24:22 - it's something that he's not comfortable
24:24 - with i don't think he's tweeted ever
24:25 - since he got the job because like he's
24:27 - like you know i've got my job i'm good
24:29 - but that was enough just i'm set but uh
24:34 - if you want to if you get your name out
24:36 - there it's first of all again it tells
24:39 - you that you did something it reminds
24:41 - you that you did something even if it
24:42 - was something hard but then it also kind
24:44 - of puts it out there in the world where
24:45 - if someone someday is trying to say man
24:48 - i wonder if anybody has ever built
24:49 - something like this before they might
24:51 - find your project or they might find
24:53 - your status they might ask you about it
24:54 - and you never know what connections
24:56 - might come from that yeah
24:58 - yeah and and so i think um there was a
25:00 - there was a question that i thought was
25:02 - really interesting um which relates to
25:05 - this which is you were you're saying
25:07 - that he was learning how to like write
25:09 - about what he's doing to communicate
25:10 - what he's doing and uh elliot asks uh or
25:14 - he just yeah he asked i realized lately
25:16 - that i'm not selling myself well how
25:18 - have you figured out how to sell
25:19 - yourself and resonate with your
25:20 - interviewers
25:23 - that is a great question and
25:25 - i i think uh that that is that is the
25:28 - golden question really figuring out how
25:30 - to sell yourself because
25:31 - selling
25:33 - cassidy williams is different from
25:34 - selling jason langsdorff it's different
25:36 - from selling sarah drazer everyone sells
25:39 - themselves differently and so you have
25:41 - to figure out kind of i
25:43 - hate to use a cliche phrase but your
25:45 - personal brand of how you want to pitch
25:48 - yourself and i think figuring that out
25:50 - involves many things first of all what
25:52 - do you want to do but also what don't
25:53 - you want to do um i think both are
25:56 - equally important a lot of people are
25:57 - just like okay i'm willing to do
25:58 - anything to get a job you're not willing
26:00 - to do anything
26:01 - make sure you know what you actually do
26:03 - want to do what you don't want to do and
26:05 - and be able to figure out how to explain
26:07 - what you can do what are you good at
26:09 - what are you not that good at
26:10 - there are things for example
26:12 - i know i am not good at low level
26:14 - languages like c and c plus i never want
26:17 - to write those again there are times
26:19 - where really cool jobs come up or i'm
26:21 - just like man
26:22 - programming robots that would be amazing
26:25 - and then i have to remind myself no it
26:27 - won't because i'll be working with these
26:28 - languages that i don't want to work with
26:30 - yeah it just sounds cool and stuff and
26:33 - so knowing what you like knowing what
26:34 - you don't like and figuring out your
26:36 - like 30 second pitch this is what i can
26:39 - do this is what i can't do and being
26:41 - able to articulate that well for
26:43 - yourself means that you can articulate
26:45 - it well to other people as you practice
26:48 - that pitch over and over um a lot of
26:50 - times for that like 30 second pitch of
26:52 - yourself whether you're going to a
26:53 - career fair or you're or just talking to
26:55 - interviewers and stuff uh practice with
26:58 - your friends
26:59 - i remember when i was in college even my
27:01 - roommates and i we would just say okay
27:03 - this is my 30-second pitch for myself
27:05 - what do you think and i would just
27:07 - introduce myself quickly explain what i
27:09 - like to do explain the things that i'm
27:11 - hoping to do
27:12 - go and then
27:14 - seeing what what they might say and then
27:16 - uh be ready for those kinds of follow-up
27:18 - questions and stuff and once again
27:19 - practice does make perfect and figuring
27:21 - out how to sell yourself does involve uh
27:24 - maybe a few flops here and there and you
27:26 - could be just like okay that approach
27:28 - was not
27:29 - great and so now i know not to do that
27:32 - one well and that's where the the
27:34 - repetition like creating your own look
27:36 - right like if you know if you're gonna
27:37 - become the best baker in the world you
27:40 - don't just find one recipe and say okay
27:42 - i'm probably done this is probably the
27:44 - best bread right you have to make a
27:45 - bunch of bad bread before you realize
27:47 - what the common elements are that make
27:50 - great bread
27:51 - can you tell i'm hungry
27:54 - i was just gonna say i could go for some
27:55 - bread
27:59 - but so i think
28:01 - something that that i
28:03 - would would kind of love to dig into
28:04 - around this is like
28:06 - when you are um
28:09 - when you're talking about this to people
28:11 - who aren't
28:12 - super confident in coming out and
28:16 - selling themselves right like i think
28:17 - when you when you talk to a lot of folks
28:19 - especially introverts the idea of
28:21 - selling
28:22 - gets really kind of skin crawly they're
28:24 - like i don't want to sell anything i
28:26 - don't like that idea
28:27 - um
28:29 - one one thing that i heard that i really
28:30 - like and that i think you're very good
28:33 - at is instead i i don't consider a lot
28:36 - of what i'm doing to be selling i
28:38 - consider it to be that i am
28:40 - looking at what somebody is trying to
28:42 - accomplish and i'm trying to match what
28:45 - i know how to do with what their goals
28:48 - are and then i'm i'm trying to connect
28:49 - those dots between
28:51 - where they are
28:52 - what i can offer and how we can get
28:54 - there so i'm not really selling myself
28:56 - i'm trying to you know
28:59 - paint this picture of what we could do
29:01 - together
29:02 - and
29:03 - how like
29:06 - i i guess
29:07 - do you fi do you follow a similar
29:09 - approach and and if so kind of how
29:12 - how i don't how do you think about that
29:14 - how does how does your brain wrap around
29:15 - that sort of conversation that's my
29:18 - exact approach to everything not just
29:20 - not even just uh professional
29:22 - conversations and stuff i figure out how
29:23 - can i relate to you in a way that will
29:25 - be interesting for you and that i can
29:28 - continue to speak to and stuff and i
29:30 - myself am a very introverted person like
29:33 - i i give tech talks and stuff i'll
29:35 - answer questions afterwards small talk
29:37 - is terrifying
29:39 - if you talk if you talk to high school
29:40 - me
29:41 - you should be shocked that i'm
29:44 - a very public persona today just because
29:47 - it's something that i never expected to
29:49 - do and and
29:51 - selling is terrifying but kind of like
29:54 - what you said really all it is is
29:56 - figuring out what will this person want
29:59 - to hear what will this person respond to
30:02 - and how can i show myself to them in a
30:05 - way that they will respond to like how
30:07 - do i frame all of this and i feel like
30:09 - every time i'm at an event every every
30:11 - time i'm i'm speaking to people whether
30:13 - it's over zoom or over an interview or
30:15 - anything it's it's figuring out okay
30:18 - as they introduce themselves getting to
30:20 - know them
30:21 - figuring out their cadence of speaking
30:23 - figuring out how they how they talk not
30:25 - necessarily just mirroring it but seeing
30:27 - okay this person does not seem to have a
30:29 - sense of humor i'm gonna cut it out and
30:31 - just try to you know
30:32 - say it's say it straight but then there
30:35 - are some people where you can tell like
30:36 - oh they smirk a little bit now and then
30:38 - okay i'll throw in a few dry jokes here
30:40 - and there and see if they like it or
30:42 - there's someone like you for example you
30:44 - laugh at jokes and i appreciate that so
30:47 - i know that i can just i can just throw
30:49 - crap to the wind and i'll get a smile
30:51 - out of it and it's great and we both
30:52 - have a good time and so i i think
30:55 - i i think that is a very
30:57 - key way of just kind of getting to know
30:59 - people and and you can build the
31:02 - relationship after the initial
31:03 - connection but sometimes the initial
31:04 - connection is figuring out how can i
31:07 - make this conversation work and and that
31:10 - really is what selling is
31:12 - yeah absolutely
31:14 - um so i have a big departure because a
31:17 - great question just came in muhammad
31:18 - asks uh i already have work as a
31:21 - software developer at a tech company but
31:23 - i'm finding it hard to do side projects
31:26 - and other ideas do you have any tips
31:29 - i get that sometimes work is exhausting
31:32 - and so at the end of the day you're just
31:33 - like
31:34 - i want to code but i can't and your
31:36 - brain is just tired and i think i think
31:39 - you have to figure out your schedule
31:41 - then and and i know some people where
31:43 - they are just exhausted at the end of
31:44 - the day they can't fathom writing more
31:47 - code and and doing stuff and so they
31:49 - start their day with it and they're just
31:50 - like okay you know what i'm gonna go to
31:52 - bed an hour earlier i'm gonna wake up an
31:54 - hour earlier and i'm just gonna code on
31:55 - my own stuff and then get to work and
31:58 - and and figuring out that kind of
32:00 - schedule for yourself i think is really
32:02 - really important because when you're
32:03 - excited about an idea uh you could you
32:06 - could code on that for ages but
32:07 - sometimes you kind of need that kick in
32:09 - the pants and so i i think for myself
32:11 - like whenever i'm getting through that
32:13 - slump or i'm just so tired at work but i
32:15 - want to work on something myself i'll
32:17 - start it in the morning go through my
32:19 - work day but if i'm excited by what i
32:21 - started in the morning i'll just work on
32:23 - it after work then because i've already
32:25 - got those juices flowing um and so i
32:27 - think figuring out a schedule for
32:29 - yourself is important there and
32:32 - experimenting with different ones until
32:33 - you find something that sticks yeah i
32:36 - think like i i've heard it described as
32:38 - as we have
32:40 - a like a reservoir of
32:42 - mental energy or willpower that we wake
32:44 - up with every day and like if we don't
32:46 - sleep enough that reservoir is is
32:48 - more empty when we start um so getting
32:51 - enough rest making sure that you are
32:53 - kind of taking care of yourself
32:54 - physically so that you can operate at
32:56 - the right level and then being aware of
32:58 - like what's taking those those like
33:00 - what's sapping that energy because there
33:02 - are a bunch of decisions that i don't
33:04 - realize drain me that drain me intensely
33:07 - like if i
33:09 - have to
33:10 - open up my fridge
33:12 - and choose what to eat like i'm like
33:15 - okay i have a bunch of ingredients i can
33:16 - cook four meals what am i gonna cook
33:18 - tonight that's actually like all of my
33:20 - side project energy trying to think of
33:23 - what i'm gonna cook so one of the ways
33:25 - that i've started hacking that is by
33:27 - making like a batch meal i'll make chili
33:30 - or curry or or something that i can make
33:32 - a lot of and then have ready so that i
33:34 - don't have to use that energy on my
33:36 - weeknights i can say okay i'm going to
33:38 - eat curry tonight because that's what's
33:39 - ready and then i'm going to work on my
33:42 - side project because i still have the
33:43 - gas in the tank to do that
33:45 - um and so you know
33:47 - what um
33:49 - let's see there are so many questions
33:50 - here that i want to make sure we want to
33:51 - get time for um
33:54 - but actually actually here's a question
33:55 - that i think is really interesting
33:57 - because everybody's routine is very
33:58 - different and everybody's got different
34:00 - like early bird night owl kind of
34:02 - routines
34:04 - what is your like typical
34:06 - day how do you split up your time among
34:09 - different projects and and work and all
34:12 - the other things that you do
34:13 - yeah and so i am one where i wake up and
34:16 - i go straight to work like so sometimes
34:19 - i will wake up
34:20 - 10 minutes before a meeting and just
34:22 - get straight to work go
34:24 - yeah yeah that's just how it is i wake
34:27 - up and it's time for work but then as
34:29 - soon as work is done i
34:31 - depending on how the day was depending
34:33 - on what i need to get done uh that's
34:35 - when i start planning out everything and
34:37 - and i do have a few projects where it's
34:39 - not just a side project for myself but
34:41 - it's something that i'm doing with
34:43 - others for example i write the stack
34:44 - overflow newsletter for that on on those
34:47 - days i need to make sure that i write
34:49 - that copy before a certain hour on a
34:51 - certain day of the week otherwise i will
34:53 - stay up all night just
34:56 - taking way too long to just write this
34:58 - dang copy and so i have to have a
34:59 - dedicated time for that in the afternoon
35:02 - um
35:03 - even even stuff
35:04 - the
35:05 - small things like
35:07 - writing tweets for work i have to have
35:09 - set times for that because otherwise i
35:11 - won't actually do it
35:13 - but then outside of that it if it's a
35:15 - project for myself or other things
35:18 - i'll kind of eat food and dawdle a
35:20 - little bit answering emails and stuff
35:22 - but then it kind of depends on
35:24 - what the project of the day is if it's
35:26 - me starting something new i actually
35:28 - almost never start a new project at my
35:30 - desk because with all of my monitors and
35:33 - stuff in front of me it's awesome
35:34 - because i can do so many things at once
35:36 - but when i want to start a brand new
35:38 - project i almost always go to a chair go
35:41 - to a couch or something and just sit
35:43 - with my laptop and focus because if i
35:45 - have this small screen in front of me
35:47 - with just like classical music in the
35:48 - background i can get all of my structure
35:51 - set up have my ideas written out have a
35:53 - notebook next to me to get it done and
35:55 - that's that's how i focus and then once
35:57 - i'm ready to like expand it a bit more
35:59 - that's when i go back to my desk and
36:00 - have the big stuff in front of me
36:02 - because otherwise i will play fortnite
36:04 - or something and and
36:07 - chat on discord and stuff and not
36:09 - actually get to work but
36:11 - typically that's that's that's the day
36:13 - if i'm starting a new project i'm away
36:14 - from my desk otherwise i'm playing games
36:17 - or working on something existing at my
36:18 - desk um
36:20 - yeah yeah i get that like if i if i even
36:24 - look at the tv
36:25 - my productivity is done for the day
36:27 - right i just i i always tell myself i'm
36:29 - like oh i'm going to watch one episode
36:30 - of the great british baking show before
36:32 - i go to bed or while i eat dinner and
36:34 - then i'm like a full season and a half
36:36 - and i'm like what have i done
36:38 - all those soggy bottoms
36:43 - yeah no
36:44 - yeah it's
36:47 - it's basically that and granted like
36:49 - pandemic work is different from remote
36:50 - work i just described a pandemic typical
36:52 - day outside of
36:54 - outside of that it totally depends
36:56 - because normally i see people and and i
36:59 - might go to an actual physical meetup
37:01 - and stuff there's there's a lot more
37:03 - uh there's a lot more things to do when
37:05 - there are things to do but when you're
37:08 - at home in a pandemic it's basically am
37:10 - i looking at a big screen or a medium
37:12 - screen or a small screen
37:14 - all the time
37:15 - i know i yeah that's
37:18 - i am very much looking forward to
37:20 - getting back to regular remote work and
37:22 - not pandemic work i know
37:25 - um
37:26 - so
37:27 - to to flip this on its head a little bit
37:29 - like you are you're very senior in your
37:31 - career you're uh you're a principal in
37:33 - your job now and you act as a you know
37:36 - you you do mentorship you've worked in
37:38 - hiring capacities you have led teams so
37:41 - i want to turn this a little bit the
37:43 - other way and i want to talk about like
37:45 - if you're looking for someone that
37:47 - you're going to give your time to or
37:49 - that you're going to give an opportunity
37:51 - to
37:52 - what have you seen that's helped
37:53 - somebody
37:55 - show that it's someone you want to
37:57 - invest that time into like how are
37:59 - people
38:00 - how are people making it visible that
38:01 - that they're somebody that you want to
38:03 - give that chance to
38:05 - first of all i
38:07 - it's one of my biggest pet peeves when
38:09 - someone dms and it's just like hey i'd
38:11 - like you to be my mentor
38:13 - i'll just
38:14 - that is not how this works i it's it's
38:17 - oh that drives me crazy because that
38:19 - relationship isn't real it's just you
38:21 - wanting something out of that person and
38:23 - so i think
38:24 - starting with a relationship first is
38:26 - key and and starting with that it often
38:28 - just involves a question and and i'll
38:31 - use an example of of a mentor of mine
38:34 - her name is kelly hoey she's awesome she
38:36 - wrote a book on networking um
38:38 - she is the person who i first met my
38:41 - junior year summer where i got her
38:43 - business card at a hackathon i emailed
38:46 - her hey it was nice to meet you i saw
38:47 - her at a few other events and stuff and
38:49 - slowly over time i would just email her
38:52 - on occasion saying kelly i really hope
38:53 - that you're well this is what i'm doing
38:55 - i'm graduating soon blah blah blah hey
38:58 - i'm in my first job i'm thinking about
38:59 - asking for a raise for the first time do
39:01 - you have any tips for me i kind of would
39:02 - just
39:04 - be
39:05 - present and stuff but i wouldn't ask
39:07 - anything of her except unless i had a
39:08 - very specific question right and over
39:10 - time we would actually start hanging out
39:12 - we would actually start meeting up and
39:14 - and she would say hey actually i need
39:16 - someone to speak at this event will you
39:17 - help me here and then sometimes i would
39:19 - say hey i actually need some advice in
39:21 - this regard can you help me here and it
39:23 - became kind of a two-way relationship it
39:25 - wasn't just me trying to get whatever i
39:27 - could out of her and a lot of times when
39:29 - i see mentorships fail it's because it's
39:31 - someone who just wants something out of
39:33 - a person and they're just like okay
39:35 - check in with me once a month to see how
39:37 - i'm doing and you can coach me as if
39:39 - it's
39:40 - as as if you're hiring them to do free
39:43 - labor and and that's that's not what
39:45 - mentorship is about mentorship is
39:47 - getting to know someone
39:49 - in a relationship a friendship where
39:51 - they just they just happen to be further
39:53 - ahead in in their career and there are
39:56 - so many people who i've mentored where
39:58 - we've never actually said the word
40:00 - mentorship before it's just it's just
40:02 - something where
40:04 - i happened to help them out a few times
40:06 - because they asked specific questions or
40:09 - they were in this chat room and they
40:10 - were saying hey would someone mind
40:12 - reviewing my resume and i would be just
40:13 - like yeah i got time i would do that and
40:15 - then we just kind of started talking
40:17 - more and more and that's just how it
40:18 - ended up being it it has to be a lot
40:21 - more natural than a mentorship proposal
40:24 - it's got to be some kind of
40:26 - some some kind of like actual back and
40:29 - forth and so when i'm
40:31 - when i'm looking for
40:32 - people to help out and everything i
40:34 - don't really actively seek out like who
40:36 - will be the next mentee of cassidy i
40:39 - don't i don't do anything like that will
40:41 - you accept this rose
40:45 - yeah no nothing like that uh it's it's
40:48 - truly just i hang out in chat rooms i'm
40:50 - i'm on twitter a lot and stuff and
40:52 - people will ask me questions on occasion
40:54 - and
40:55 - if it's if it's not like a full essay if
40:58 - it's because i get enough dms i can't
41:01 - read every essay that comes my way um
41:04 - i'll answer it and and sometimes we just
41:07 - chat a few times on occasion sometimes
41:09 - they'll send me their resume a couple
41:11 - times and stuff and then
41:12 - eventually we just kind of have this
41:14 - relationship where we're just chatting
41:16 - on occasion and i occasionally help them
41:18 - and then they'll retweet my stuff and
41:20 - and it becomes a little back and forth
41:22 - and so
41:23 - it
41:25 - i guess if you are looking for a mentor
41:28 - don't actively be just like who will be
41:30 - the one who will guide me
41:32 - just
41:33 - put have a presence in certain
41:34 - communities and kind of put out there
41:36 - that you're learning put out there that
41:39 - you want your resume looked at or that
41:40 - you're not sure what to do here
41:42 - occasionally post questions and as
41:45 - people start answering the questions the
41:47 - the mentors kind of come out of the fold
41:49 - quickly when you're in these kind of
41:51 - community discords for example um there
41:54 - are there are sometimes chats where
41:55 - people would just like hey does anybody
41:57 - know anything about this i i'm new to
41:59 - writing golang and i'm really curious
42:01 - about how this kind of stuff works as
42:03 - people answer your questions you can be
42:05 - just like okay great and then you can
42:07 - ask more questions again in the future
42:08 - eventually you'll see who keeps who
42:10 - continually replies you can occasionally
42:12 - dm them a really nice thank you saying
42:15 - thank you to people oh my god
42:18 - just say thank you it's huge it's so
42:21 - easy and it goes so far it goes so far
42:24 - there are so many times where i've just
42:25 - sent very simple thank you notes
42:28 - over email or something and people will
42:30 - reply back saying you know this is the
42:32 - first time someone's ever thanked me for
42:34 - this i i really appreciate it thank you
42:36 - like there's just
42:38 - it means so much to people to see that
42:40 - their efforts to help you didn't go
42:42 - unseen like you didn't just say thanks
42:44 - and then and then bounce yeah and so
42:46 - really just be
42:49 - be a giving person and be a be a
42:52 - grateful person and and be a part of
42:54 - your communities because the mentors
42:56 - will come out of the fold as you uh
42:58 - start helping and sometimes your mentor
43:01 - is the community and and it's it's just
43:03 - a group thing where you're helping each
43:04 - other you know that actually i think
43:08 - that hit so close to home for me because
43:10 - one of the things that i've realized
43:13 - as you know i i went from being somebody
43:15 - who was brand new to the industry i you
43:17 - know i lived in montana i didn't have
43:19 - any connections and i would see people
43:21 - who gave keynotes or who
43:24 - worked at the companies that i wanted to
43:25 - work at and i would think oh my god
43:27 - these must be like celebrities i
43:28 - remember thinking that paul irish
43:30 - probably like had a malibu mansion and
43:32 - and you know like was the and like he
43:35 - might but he but at the same time i
43:37 - don't i haven't met a single person in
43:39 - tech who's got a name who is walking
43:41 - around thinking like
43:43 - you know
43:44 - i'm pretty great everybody should well i
43:46 - guess i have met people like that but in
43:48 - general like there are there's nobody
43:50 - walking around going like i am a mentor
43:53 - and you are the mentees it's it's very
43:56 - much like there's a community
43:59 - and
44:00 - it it feels
44:02 - awkward to me when somebody says
44:06 - can you be my mentor because i don't
44:08 - feel like i am
44:10 - i don't feel like i'm qualified to do
44:12 - that i'm just a dude writing code um and
44:15 - like i know some things but i don't know
44:16 - way more things
44:18 - and so what i found is that when the
44:20 - community is built around this idea of
44:23 - knowledge share and like knowledge
44:24 - transfer and everybody is participating
44:28 - then it starts to become a really good
44:30 - like
44:31 - co-mentoring or just like co-growth
44:34 - scenario as opposed to uh
44:37 - it doesn't it shouldn't be pedagogical
44:39 - like if i put together a workshop great
44:40 - come learn from me but if i'm just being
44:42 - a person
44:44 - i don't what i don't want to give
44:46 - lectures i don't want to
44:48 - like sit you down and try to teach you
44:50 - something i want to talk to you like a
44:51 - person like i want my online existence
44:54 - is about having friends not about having
44:56 - students and i think that that is um
44:58 - that's something that if if we can get
45:00 - out of the mindset of like there are
45:02 - people who are here and they're the rest
45:04 - of us down here
45:06 - it levels that playing field you can
45:07 - talk to somebody like a human and you
45:08 - have such a better chance if you just
45:11 - ask a question and then if you know
45:13 - something offer some advice and support
45:16 - um it's yeah i i and that that's
45:18 - actually something that i really like is
45:20 - you know you've got your your discord
45:23 - for like your twitch subscribers your
45:24 - patreon supporters and
45:26 - that's not like
45:28 - cassidy holding court it's
45:31 - hanging out with people
45:32 - right it truly is and and like there
45:35 - there have been some people who have
45:37 - when i've said oh my my patreon discord
45:40 - group is so great they're just like ah
45:42 - this is an interesting business model a
45:44 - thought leader letting people in on
45:46 - their deep secrets i'm just like no
45:48 - that's not what it is really it's just a
45:50 - great discord group where because
45:52 - there's a two dollar entrance fee
45:54 - quote unquote there's less spam that's
45:57 - that's truly that's truly what it is and
45:59 - and the group is so
46:01 - helpful to each other it's such a nice
46:03 - community and and people are are really
46:05 - really giving and and i think
46:08 - i think that is really really important
46:10 - to realize
46:12 - yeah all of these people who you think
46:13 - are up here they're just people they
46:15 - just have more dms that's that's all it
46:17 - really is
46:19 - that's such a good question yes
46:21 - absolutely that's exactly what it is
46:24 - same person worse dms um
46:30 - uh so i saw a couple good questions come
46:32 - in that i that i want to look at so
46:33 - because you've been involved with hiring
46:36 - developers what are the biggest mistakes
46:38 - that you've seen like what are the
46:39 - things that really like grind on you so
46:41 - you mentioned one of them like saying
46:42 - will you be my mentor but what what else
46:44 - have you seen oh i've seen i've seen so
46:47 - many things it just oh i've got stories
46:50 - out the wazoo some more extreme examples
46:53 - but for example an extreme example is
46:55 - one time someone applied to a job where
46:58 - i was reviewing the resumes and stuff
46:59 - after they had gone through a few loops
47:01 - i was like oh this resume looks good and
47:02 - i went to look at their personal website
47:04 - and it was my personal website like all
47:07 - they did was change the name and the bio
47:09 - but like it was my code they even kept
47:11 - my comments in and stuff and i was like
47:13 - what are you thinking
47:15 - and then uh
47:16 - there was one time where
47:18 - i
47:19 - was interviewing a person in person they
47:21 - were doing whiteboarding
47:23 - and they just started crying part way
47:25 - through and i felt i felt really bad and
47:27 - i know i know it's like high pressure
47:29 - and stuff but then when i tried to say
47:32 - here i can change the question or here's
47:34 - a kleenex or don't worry about it they
47:36 - would say no and then just put their
47:38 - hand up and wouldn't let me talk and we
47:40 - literally sat there in silence while
47:42 - they cried for 45 minutes whoa it was
47:47 - terrible so these are very extreme
47:49 - examples
47:51 - but i think they they are
47:53 - very very key to
47:55 - their they're indicative of certain
47:57 - things so first of all things that i
47:59 - don't like to see i don't like to see
48:01 - people who are not open for feedback
48:05 - if if you say no or something or
48:08 - someone's trying to help you out or
48:09 - something that's that is a red flag if
48:11 - someone's crying an interview in an
48:13 - interview i understand it is high
48:15 - pressure
48:16 - but don't take it out on the interviewer
48:18 - just just uh
48:20 - just be willing to
48:22 - take your time to get calm and then work
48:25 - on it again it's that that would have
48:26 - been fine but it was because of that
48:28 - reaction that it wasn't great um for for
48:31 - a personal website if you're gonna just
48:33 - straight up copy a personal website at
48:35 - least give credit don't take work and
48:38 - then pass it off as your own and then
48:40 - yes and that is that is something that
48:43 - oh it peeves me because i've seen that
48:44 - not just for myself but so many people
48:46 - where they they claim that they're like
48:49 - the world's best developer or whatever
48:50 - and then
48:51 - you see that their code is not their own
48:54 - it's it's frustrating and so really a
48:56 - lot of it is putting your ego at the
48:57 - door
48:58 - um don't
49:00 - be willing to get feedback be willing to
49:03 - admit both strengths and weaknesses um
49:06 - and
49:08 - what i really love in interviews is if i
49:10 - ask a question and someone like is
49:12 - working on and stuff and then they just
49:14 - admit
49:15 - they say honestly i'm not entirely sure
49:17 - how to do this normally this is
49:18 - something i would google i love that
49:20 - honesty
49:21 - so much
49:23 - i don't hold it against them at all
49:25 - because that's something that
49:26 - it's true there are times where i have
49:28 - to google the most basic javascript
49:30 - things even though i've been using
49:31 - javascript for like 15 years it
49:36 - sometimes you just need to google it and
49:37 - and so i love seeing that kind of
49:39 - honesty and and lack of ego and
49:42 - humbleness when you're in an interview
49:44 - setting
49:46 - yeah i i
49:48 - would just echo that a thousand times i
49:50 - think that's such a
49:51 - that's such an important thing is to
49:53 - just like
49:55 - you know again be a person like you're
49:57 - not selling
49:58 - the the
50:00 - 10 of your brain that knows
50:02 - programming you're selling your entire
50:05 - existence you're gonna be
50:06 - you know your your sense of humor you're
50:08 - gonna be your your strengths your
50:10 - weaknesses all of that stuff and showing
50:13 - that is what makes people feel like
50:15 - you're a human you know it's one of the
50:17 - things that i that i think is so
50:19 - um
50:20 - it's it's what makes someone online kind
50:23 - of magnetic it's why we follow certain
50:25 - accounts not because of
50:27 - you know because of their technical
50:28 - content like i follow a lot of people
50:30 - who write code that i don't understand
50:32 - they're java programmers or they they
50:34 - write you know they're doing machine
50:35 - learning stuff i don't do that i can't
50:37 - really follow their examples but oh my
50:39 - god do i love to watch them they're just
50:41 - so engaging they're so fun they're
50:43 - they're whole humans and that's actually
50:45 - kind of how i started following you was
50:47 - because of your
50:48 - uh your tick tock and so maybe this is a
50:51 - good question to to kind of end on but
50:55 - i feel like authenticity
50:57 - is a really loaded word right we we say
50:59 - that and it becomes more of a marketing
51:01 - term
51:01 - but
51:03 - in the sense of of
51:05 - you and your
51:06 - kind of existence as a human and online
51:09 - um
51:11 - how much do you think
51:13 - bringing all of yourself versus just the
51:16 - technical part has influenced your
51:19 - career
51:21 - i think
51:22 - the moment i started to bring more of
51:25 - myself out there is when my career
51:27 - really started to take off
51:29 - or not even my career just online
51:31 - presence and stuff in general like i've
51:33 - always been making silly videos and
51:35 - jokes since i was since i could operate
51:37 - a camcorder because i started on
51:39 - camcorders back in the day and and uh i
51:43 - i would always just like be silly with
51:45 - all kinds of things i was always into
51:47 - building cool stuff like mechanical
51:48 - keyboards but on my twitter on my
51:51 - facebook all over the place i only
51:52 - talked about code
51:54 - about a year and a half ago or whatever
51:56 - when i started making these funny videos
51:58 - and decided to tweet about them
52:00 - that's when suddenly
52:02 - my online presence just shot up that's
52:04 - when suddenly people were just like were
52:06 - actually following me and everything
52:08 - because it wasn't just coding content it
52:11 - was fun coding content it was humor it
52:13 - was me talking more about keyboard
52:15 - suddenly it was it was a bit more
52:17 - interesting to see and i think
52:19 - and i'm not trying to like toot my own
52:21 - horn like because i'm hilarious now i
52:23 - have hundreds of thousands of followers
52:25 - it's not that what i'm saying is
52:28 - by being authentic suddenly people
52:31 - actually cared what i had to say and i
52:32 - think that's really indicative of a lot
52:35 - when i see that people are tweeting
52:37 - about all kinds of things and they're
52:38 - not just sticking to tech i i love
52:41 - seeing that and it
52:43 - i've seen some people where like they'll
52:45 - tweet a picture with their kids and i've
52:47 - seen people reply saying uh stick to
52:50 - tech i follow you for tech news you
52:52 - don't want those kinds of followers
52:53 - anyway you have people who who want to
52:55 - get to know you and stuff and so and so
52:58 - ignore those people i love seeing people
53:01 - who
53:02 - talk about their interests outside of
53:04 - tech on the internet like granted i love
53:06 - seeing the technical content i will read
53:08 - almost every technical blog i can see
53:10 - and write things down and stuff so that
53:12 - way i can read more about it but when i
53:15 - see for example on your channel how
53:18 - you have your learn with jason stuff but
53:20 - you also talk about like cooking and
53:21 - everything i love learning about that
53:23 - and seeing what different interests
53:25 - people have i love seeing when people
53:27 - are interested in korean dramas because
53:28 - i can say oh have you seen this one yet
53:30 - or i love when people are interested in
53:33 - drawing because i would love to be a
53:35 - better artist but i'm just not and and
53:37 - just seeing how they draw and and use
53:39 - that side of their brain i think is so
53:41 - cool um
53:43 - when i when i follow people a lot of the
53:45 - people that i follow on twitter and on
53:47 - instagram and stuff they might be tech
53:49 - people but they're almost always
53:51 - something else they're they're rarely
53:53 - just someone who contributes to open
53:54 - source a lot and and it's because i
53:57 - appreciate seeing the authenticity of
53:59 - someone who
54:01 - doesn't just code all the time who's
54:02 - interested in other things and and it's
54:04 - cool to see the cool side projects and
54:06 - stuff don't get me wrong i love seeing
54:07 - when someone launches something cool
54:09 - coding wise but seeing people do
54:13 - other things and and put their whole
54:15 - self out there in the workplace and out
54:17 - of the workplace i think is very very
54:19 - huge
54:20 - uh and and i think is
54:22 - important because
54:24 - it
54:25 - allows you to
54:27 - have a work-life balance built in
54:29 - because you go to an employer and they
54:31 - know that this is who you are like i
54:32 - know a gal where she
54:34 - um she was working at yahoo and she
54:38 - reviewed operas on the side she's
54:40 - actually
54:41 - she she's an opera viewer like
54:43 - that is her side gig she she reviews
54:46 - operas around the world she's awesome
54:48 - and her every single job interview she
54:51 - talked about it because people know in
54:53 - her workplace
54:55 - if she says i have to be out of here by
54:57 - 4 pm today because i have to go to this
54:58 - opera they know this is her thing right
55:01 - and and so that is built into her
55:02 - schedule she has kind of a built-in
55:04 - work-life balance because she brought
55:06 - her whole self to the table
55:09 - online in the interview and and
55:10 - elsewhere and so i think it's really
55:13 - important to be authentic about that
55:15 - saying i'm a parent saying i
55:18 - like to build keyboards saying i like to
55:21 - stream or play video games and stuff
55:23 - being willing to put yourself there
55:25 - it it sets an expectation that work is
55:28 - not your life and and i think that's
55:30 - really important work is not your life
55:33 - is such a good ending point for this i
55:36 - think so i'm not even gonna try to
55:38 - follow that up so instead what i'm gonna
55:40 - say is thank you so so much for taking
55:43 - the time to hang out with us today and
55:44 - sharing all of this wonderful insight
55:47 - into who you are and and how we can take
55:49 - some inspiration from from what you've
55:51 - done to try to expand our own careers um
55:54 - what i am gonna do is i'm gonna drop a
55:55 - couple things here uh so for anyone who
55:57 - wants to you can find cassidy live on

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone and welcome to the second episode of connecting the dots and today with me i've got cassidy williams cassidy thank you so much for hanging out with us today thank you for having me i'm excited i am just tickled pink you uh you chose to come and join us on here i think this is gonna be an absolute blast um so i mean i i feel like you're one of the people who needs no introduction but maybe we should do just for the the sake of anyone who's been living under a rock or doesn't go on twitter or isn't familiar with tick tock um you want to give a little bit of an introduction for yourself hello everyone i exist um uh i'm a i'm a dev experienced engineer with jason at netlify i make beams on the internet and that's really the high level thing i could i could go into more detail but i figure we will throughout this whole thing yeah i think that's that's our whole goal today so um for everyone in the chat thank you so much for hanging out with us today the the goal of what we want to talk about today is um like the premise for the show is that i think a lot of people are looking for work right now it's been a hard year uh tech is getting busier and busier there are more and more people who are are moving into the field through boot camps through traditional means through nontraditional means just studying on their own um and that means that there are a lot of folks who are trying to get that first role and so what we want to do on the show is talk to people like yourself who have a like a stellar career you know you've done a lot of amazing things that we'll talk about and you've got an amazing network that we'll also talk about but kind of rewind that a little bit and talk about how you got those first steps and how you started that journey and also the part that i find most interesting is when we're talking about a tech career what is it that we're able to bring to it that's not tech training so not being a developer not being computer science major but what do we bring from the rest of ourselves that gives us an advantage that gives us that opportunity to go further and do more with our tech career um so i guess to to jump right into this how did you like what was your journey from like not in tech to first tech job how did you how did you get started um so i have a very traditional background i actually have a cs degree um and studied computer science i started coding when i was a teenager and and played around with things started building stuff i took ap computer science in high school and then got uh got my computer science degree um but in college i kind of did have a shift that introduced me to the tech industry um that i think was significant where i started doing internships and stuff and and uh i would say probably my junior year was when i really started getting connected and that's when i started actually networking with people which i think was the biggest shift of all because um once i started going to hackathons and conferences and meetups and just any any events that i could go to and granted i went to iowa state university excellent school loved it there um but iowa is kind of in the middle of nowhere and so a lot of people think oh dang i have to be in san francisco to go to the meetups and stuff you don't you can be in the middle of iowa and and still go to these things and so um i i started getting connected by just emailing with people going to office hours and saying hey i heard you're connected with this person can i get an introduction just starting to kind of put out feelers getting involved with online communities and doing that just really opened so many doors for me where uh my junior year of college i was invited to speak at the white house and my sister and i both ended up speaking at the white house to talk about inclusion and technology and stuff with with a bunch of other uh women our age which was an amazing opportunity and people who i met there i ended up following up emailing them and then one of them ended up becoming a mentor to me um and then that next summer i interned out in silicon valley and i called it my summer of networking because i truly just i went to either a hackathon or a meetup at least twice a week the entire summer i was just concerned where's most people most people are having their summer of love you had your summer of linkedin requests but actually that's exactly how i described it i was just like i want to get 300 connections on linkedin this summer alone like i i set that as a goal but it's true i know i know it's i know it's like the nerdy thing to do at a summer internship but i it it changed the trajectory of my career really because absolutely i was able to get connected to so many cool people where one of the people who i met that summer ended up she's a mentor to me to this day and she's amazing and she was just someone where i got her business card at a hackathon and emailed hey it was nice to meet you and now she was invited to my wedding she's someone who i talk with regularly like it just happened to be that way and so i think i think the networking aspect is something that really just uh helped take off my career because even though like networking doesn't get you everywhere you still need to know how to code you still need to know how to do things being able to make those connections with people is so vital for just getting your foot in the door sometimes and and i've been able to have so many cool experiences because i've been willing to go through all of the emails of people who are at an event send a nice to meet you and just get to know some of those people absolutely and so i want to dig into something a little bit because you have this almost otherworldly ability to end up in the room you just said you know your junior year college you spoke at the white house you are part of a um like a react core team community call where you kind of talk to the react team about what should and shouldn't happen in the community and and you've got like you seem to be involved in all of the things and that we could just say oh well that's just cassidy she's special but i don't think that's true i think you work really hard at that and so i'm i would love to hear what what is it that you're doing how are you making these connections and and you know what what did you do to get that invite to the white house what are you doing to to get invited to these calls with with different community leaders and and you know to do the mc work and all of this you know the phrase that my mom always says is squeaky wheel gets the grease a lot of times it's just asking and being loud about it and stuff and so like not not just like getting invited to the white house and and getting invited to speak at the u.n getting invited to to go to all these cool places that was stuff where truly there was for example one of the things that i did that junior summer that again changed trajectory of my career it was a hackathon on a plane and it was a flight from san francisco to london and it was all of these tech leaders on the plane i was the only undergrad student on this plane and the other people were so much cooler than me like craig of craigslist was on the plane megan smith who's cto of the united states was on the plane uh just uh kimberly bryant from black girls code was on the plane all these really cool people i found out the plane was happening i emailed the organizers and i said hey i'm really interested in this do you have space for someone like me and then i like sent them my resume and they said actually some people just dropped out sure we can fill your spot wow that's a cooler spot like it was truly me just asking and if you don't ask you don't get really and so i a lot of it is just asking and and for example uh getting to know the react team and getting involved with with all these technical groups a lot of times it was just me sliding into the dms and saying hey i'm really interested in this work that you're doing i don't know if you can ever use me but i think it would be great to be involved in something like this because i'm really interested in the technology that you're using it it's small but that's something that is significant i remember when i was first in my first tech job in brooklyn and i would always go to the brooklyn js meetup and and just getting to know people there and uh i saw that at one of the events john resig was going to be there for those who don't know he made jquery i dm'd him beforehand and i just said hey john i saw you're going to be at this meetup i hope i meet you there see ya left it at that and then at the meetup he approached me and i remember i was with all my coworkers and he was just like hey you're the one who dm'd me it's so nice to meet you cassidy and like that was truly the interaction the street cred i got when john resig approached me but well it it was significant because because he approached me i got to have a conversation with him and then people who wouldn't normally talk to me started talking to me because they saw that i had this connection with someone who's big in the industry yeah and it's it's something that i think is undervalued in tech to just be willing to kind of put your ego at the door and just ask and just reach out and and talk to people you know you you brought up two things that i think are really interesting the the first one is it would be really easy to chalk a lot of this up to luck you you emailed that hackathon on a plane and it just so happened that somebody had dropped out and they had space right so oh lucky but this is i think a really good example of creating your own luck um because you know if if we look back on this how many of these emails have you sent that got ghosted that went nowhere where you gotta know so many constantly like there are sometimes people on twitter i'm just like i remember i dm'd them and they never dm'd me back and it's just like just oh i forgot they existed they probably never knew i did that's just that happens all the time but you never know if someone will reply i i take the same approach with raffles i apply to every raffle i enter people think i win a lot of raffles i've won quite a few things that's how i got my kindle that's how i got just like various lego sets and stuff that i have you never know if you could win your percentage is low but you could get lucky and and i kind of take the same approach with with that kind of i take the same approach with job uh interviews too when i was in college i think i applied to over a hundred maybe 200 jobs and people were just like dang you got a lot of job offers i'm like yeah but do you know how many interviews i had to go to yeah dozens and dozens and thousands of interviews and sure i had like a decent picking to choose from in the end but it was because i did so many job interviews yeah oh i think i mean that that is such an important part that i think it's it gets skipped a lot when we talk about these because you know the the happenstance or the chance encounters or the the lucky break a lot of times that happens because you do you know hundreds of job applications or send hundreds of of dms that go ignored and you know i i think that it can be really easy to to send off one job request and you don't hear anything back and you go oh i must not be any good at this and the fact of the matter is that like you're only half of the equation you're also waiting for someone to be at the right place at the right time with the right needs and so you have to create as many of those opportunities as you can to to you know be the right person at the right time to let people know that you're available so when they have that need they go oh i just talked to cassidy she's looking for this kind of work we should talk to her like that's you know though i i i always and maybe you'll you'll echo this but i feel like i hear a lot of people who say nothing's happening this doesn't work i'm never gonna make it in this industry and i always tell them i'm like look it's this is gonna feel like nothing's happening and then it's all gonna happen at once you just gotta keep showing up yeah a friend of mine actually uh was looking for a job for a solid year and a half and nothing was happening and he kept putting up feelers kept applying and stuff and he finally started his brand new job this week and he was so excited because he was finally in this startup and literally three days after he started three of those startups or three or four of those startups that he had applied to suddenly were just like hey we really liked talking to you back in the day but we're just now having openings and he's just like well that timing is nuts because it you know just like you said you never know when that timing will work out and so just it's a numbers game absolutely all kinds of opportunities and conversations and things a lot of times it's truly just putting it out there and seeing what might come back yeah um and and that actually i think is a nice kind of segue into into something i'd love to talk to you about in particular because i think that you have a really unique presence on on uh everywhere that you show up which is that you are like legitimately funny and um and i think that like it's it it was when i first met you and and i'm not saying that like oh i met you and i thought you were funny and now i don't but but when i when i first met you i think i would have assumed that you are just like a naturally funny person and that you know you you're just everything that you see you're like i've got a funny joke for that and you just you just whip off zingers all the time and what i've realized through through you actually you taught our team how to be funny which was i i love that um but you you have this approach to everything where you repeatedly try the same thing a little bit different and where you're you're tweaking approaches and and kind of assessing that can you talk a little bit through maybe not necessarily in humor but just in like your approach in general um how does that factor in to your career do you think yeah so to that between between jokes between project ideas between pretty much everything i just write everything down and and i have i have both physical notebooks i have drawings i have digital ones i have managers of all kinds of things i write absolutely everything down because you never know if something might be useful right and sometimes it's a code snippet sometimes it's just a statement sometimes it's look into this website because this might be interesting someday there there are so many things where i i'm even still on pinterest where i purely just put like projects that i might want to do someday just to see if something might land and a lot of times it's me kind of prepping for some day in the future that may never come but for for every joke for every tweet for every task i take on sometimes even jobs i might want to apply to someday i write them down because it's it's kind of i guess it's kind of like that second brain concept in a way because there are times where you might think of a good idea and just forget it and i will forget things if i don't write it down and and so just getting it down on paper helps remember it and then tagging things properly organizing yourself properly you never know when an idea you might have one day might actually be the perfect idea years later yeah um and and so as part of this too you know you're you're writing everything down you're keeping track of these ideas uh but you're also i would i would guess you know i know for for me at least when i'm trying to make jokes i spend a lot of time making jokes that are only marginally funny or not funny at all and i learn like when i try it this way it gets a little bit of a laugh if i tweak it like this it gets a lot of a laugh and i found similar things in my in my career if i build a thing like this people get it if i present it like this people kind of recoil and back away um how would you say that that sort of approach because i know that you're you're similar and that you you try things and tweak and try things and tweak how does that affect your confidence you only get more confident over time i think i think for example a good example of this is i used to teach workshops fulltime for for react and stuff and when i was first teaching i was like man i know this material but i am nervous for teaching people about it we'll see how it goes and it went decently at first and i was just like okay you know what they asked those questions so i'm going to try to make sure this information is particularly clear so the next workshop it's tweaked ever so slightly and the more i did it the more the the more refined it got it's kind of like uh standup comedians how they want their type 10. they they rework a joke until it's funny enough that that they consistently get a laugh um there's this phrase that i like to use repetition is recognition try different approaches whether it's a coding approach a humor approach a talk approach a blog approach um you you perfect it and and practice does make perfect for pretty much everything yeah yeah i i think so a couple people in the chat are asking about um how to build confidence for tech interviews and would you say that's you know that's how you would recommend it or are there other tips that you would recommend 100 recommend it again when i said it was a numbers game like every single interview is a practice interview and like the i have done a lot of interviews i i have interviewed at a lot of places sometimes i interview even when i'm not looking for a job just because it's good practice and learning how to present yourself in an interview figuring out what kind of approaches do and don't work experiencing different interviewers where you can kind of get a vibe is this person someone who would kind of smirk if you make a selfdeprecating joke or is this the kind of person who would just like be stoic you kind of figure out your approaches as you interact with all of these different interviewers and that really helps over time and and i truly think that i'm decent at interviewing not because i'm perfect at getting merge sort and the proper space and time complexity but because i've done it so many times and because i've interacted with interviewers so many times that i know how to it feels like gaming the system but really it's just practice absolutely yeah i found the same thing like the the one of the reasons that i run learn with jason is because it forces me to practice like i i get put into situations with things i don't know and i have to just figure it out and because of that i feel like my stress tolerance is so much higher because i just do it all the time and i practice doing that live stuff um so there's a question in the chat which i think is actually pretty interesting um shidanza is asking what's an effective way of practicing coding and like what sort of intermediate goals should you keep for that practice so there's there's so many different ways to practice coding and i guess it depends on your goals and i hate answering it depends when that is kind of the answer but um so so for example if you really want to get good at like a certain type of algorithm or data structure try implementing it in different languages start implementing it in pseudocode first implement certain things in pseudocode first then do it to python then ruby then javascript then java and stuff figure out how you can kind of solidify that information where it's yes you're experimenting with different languages but you're really getting used to the structure of that data you're really getting used to how that algorithm should be meanwhile if you're trying to really just get good at javascript just constantly build things with javascript i remember uh like i there was a point where i was really keen on maintaining my github streak and i had like i think was 128 days on github of just straight coding and a lot of times my projects were just dumb they were not they were not particularly useful projects i was just like you know what i want to just get good at javascript and so i just tried to build something with it every day and sometimes it was a few lines of code sometimes i'd get past that writer's block and and write a ton of code um but really it's just build something and and there's so many ideas out there to build and you can start with something basic like a todo list a book review app something like that but then as as you practice be like a chat app a reddit clone just just keep keep kind of copying existing ideas while building it in your own unique way to to really just practice it and and for example i tried to get better at css for a long time and so i every single thursday i called it codepen thursdays i'd build something on codepen i'd get a design from dribble or something and just try to recreate it i'd give myself an hour sometimes it was not perfect but it got me practicing and and slowly but surely i got decent at css because i was practicing it enough and suddenly i was able to say okay well if i know i need to center this these are the three approaches i can take and and just go with it and so truly just code and it's hard to get started but start with something dumb and basic and just build up as you get ideas and as you get an app idea that you want to build write it down because then you can use that idea later yeah i and i think like what you're what you're mentioning too there's also another thing that you can do with that which which you talked about briefly but i want to dig into a little bit more which is you were practicing but then you created codepen thursdays and that was something you could share and so if you're trying to learn something like one of my favorite examples of this is lynne fisher she does a project called a single div and during october she does divtober and every single day she makes a css illustration or animation using just css most of the time in codepen and shares it and as a result she's built huge name recognition she's one of the like the the first people you would think of if you wanted to do beautiful css art you would go oh we need lin fisher and that's not because like that's not even her job she's like an executive at a at an agency or something and she just at least she just does this because she likes doing it and as a result she's become a leading expert on it um how do you feel that that sort of of kind of exposing your work even if it's not the best thing you've ever built how has that impacted your career do you think learning in public is huge and and i think i think that's something that a lot of people should do i know it's not for everybody so i don't want to say everyone should do this but it gets your name out there and sometimes that is that is all you need to to do something really well with your career or do some make connections that you need um an example of this honestly is my fatherinlaw he he's a 55yearold korean man and he decided he wanted to learn how to code three years ago and so we were practicing with him we were helping him learn and and as he was building stuff he was just like this is really interesting to me but he was having trouble in interviews because his english wasn't so great and he was nervous about ageism and on all kinds of stuff and we said okay how about this start posting on twitter even if it's even if it's just like i built this today and no links or anything just start posting regularly so that way so that way your your name can be out there a bit and it worked there there was a point where it was he did like a hundred days of code where he would just say like today i implemented n10 tests on this or today today i struggled with this i don't know if i'll be able to get it done but i'm working on it that gave him practice writing that gave him practice explaining what he was working on that gave him the recognition of oh yeah i did accomplish something today and then when he tweeted out that he was looking for a job people who had been noticing his tweets over time he he was able to get on calls with them and and after doing the job interview process which took a very long time he started his first job this year his first software engineering job and he's killing it and it's truly just from all the practice and putting his name out there and and it's something that he's not comfortable with i don't think he's tweeted ever since he got the job because like he's like you know i've got my job i'm good but that was enough just i'm set but uh if you want to if you get your name out there it's first of all again it tells you that you did something it reminds you that you did something even if it was something hard but then it also kind of puts it out there in the world where if someone someday is trying to say man i wonder if anybody has ever built something like this before they might find your project or they might find your status they might ask you about it and you never know what connections might come from that yeah yeah and and so i think um there was a there was a question that i thought was really interesting um which relates to this which is you were you're saying that he was learning how to like write about what he's doing to communicate what he's doing and uh elliot asks uh or he just yeah he asked i realized lately that i'm not selling myself well how have you figured out how to sell yourself and resonate with your interviewers that is a great question and i i think uh that that is that is the golden question really figuring out how to sell yourself because selling cassidy williams is different from selling jason langsdorff it's different from selling sarah drazer everyone sells themselves differently and so you have to figure out kind of i hate to use a cliche phrase but your personal brand of how you want to pitch yourself and i think figuring that out involves many things first of all what do you want to do but also what don't you want to do um i think both are equally important a lot of people are just like okay i'm willing to do anything to get a job you're not willing to do anything make sure you know what you actually do want to do what you don't want to do and and be able to figure out how to explain what you can do what are you good at what are you not that good at there are things for example i know i am not good at low level languages like c and c plus i never want to write those again there are times where really cool jobs come up or i'm just like man programming robots that would be amazing and then i have to remind myself no it won't because i'll be working with these languages that i don't want to work with yeah it just sounds cool and stuff and so knowing what you like knowing what you don't like and figuring out your like 30 second pitch this is what i can do this is what i can't do and being able to articulate that well for yourself means that you can articulate it well to other people as you practice that pitch over and over um a lot of times for that like 30 second pitch of yourself whether you're going to a career fair or you're or just talking to interviewers and stuff uh practice with your friends i remember when i was in college even my roommates and i we would just say okay this is my 30second pitch for myself what do you think and i would just introduce myself quickly explain what i like to do explain the things that i'm hoping to do go and then seeing what what they might say and then uh be ready for those kinds of followup questions and stuff and once again practice does make perfect and figuring out how to sell yourself does involve uh maybe a few flops here and there and you could be just like okay that approach was not great and so now i know not to do that one well and that's where the the repetition like creating your own look right like if you know if you're gonna become the best baker in the world you don't just find one recipe and say okay i'm probably done this is probably the best bread right you have to make a bunch of bad bread before you realize what the common elements are that make great bread can you tell i'm hungry i was just gonna say i could go for some bread but so i think something that that i would would kind of love to dig into around this is like when you are um when you're talking about this to people who aren't super confident in coming out and selling themselves right like i think when you when you talk to a lot of folks especially introverts the idea of selling gets really kind of skin crawly they're like i don't want to sell anything i don't like that idea um one one thing that i heard that i really like and that i think you're very good at is instead i i don't consider a lot of what i'm doing to be selling i consider it to be that i am looking at what somebody is trying to accomplish and i'm trying to match what i know how to do with what their goals are and then i'm i'm trying to connect those dots between where they are what i can offer and how we can get there so i'm not really selling myself i'm trying to you know paint this picture of what we could do together and how like i i guess do you fi do you follow a similar approach and and if so kind of how how i don't how do you think about that how does how does your brain wrap around that sort of conversation that's my exact approach to everything not just not even just uh professional conversations and stuff i figure out how can i relate to you in a way that will be interesting for you and that i can continue to speak to and stuff and i myself am a very introverted person like i i give tech talks and stuff i'll answer questions afterwards small talk is terrifying if you talk if you talk to high school me you should be shocked that i'm a very public persona today just because it's something that i never expected to do and and selling is terrifying but kind of like what you said really all it is is figuring out what will this person want to hear what will this person respond to and how can i show myself to them in a way that they will respond to like how do i frame all of this and i feel like every time i'm at an event every every time i'm i'm speaking to people whether it's over zoom or over an interview or anything it's it's figuring out okay as they introduce themselves getting to know them figuring out their cadence of speaking figuring out how they how they talk not necessarily just mirroring it but seeing okay this person does not seem to have a sense of humor i'm gonna cut it out and just try to you know say it's say it straight but then there are some people where you can tell like oh they smirk a little bit now and then okay i'll throw in a few dry jokes here and there and see if they like it or there's someone like you for example you laugh at jokes and i appreciate that so i know that i can just i can just throw crap to the wind and i'll get a smile out of it and it's great and we both have a good time and so i i think i i think that is a very key way of just kind of getting to know people and and you can build the relationship after the initial connection but sometimes the initial connection is figuring out how can i make this conversation work and and that really is what selling is yeah absolutely um so i have a big departure because a great question just came in muhammad asks uh i already have work as a software developer at a tech company but i'm finding it hard to do side projects and other ideas do you have any tips i get that sometimes work is exhausting and so at the end of the day you're just like i want to code but i can't and your brain is just tired and i think i think you have to figure out your schedule then and and i know some people where they are just exhausted at the end of the day they can't fathom writing more code and and doing stuff and so they start their day with it and they're just like okay you know what i'm gonna go to bed an hour earlier i'm gonna wake up an hour earlier and i'm just gonna code on my own stuff and then get to work and and and figuring out that kind of schedule for yourself i think is really really important because when you're excited about an idea uh you could you could code on that for ages but sometimes you kind of need that kick in the pants and so i i think for myself like whenever i'm getting through that slump or i'm just so tired at work but i want to work on something myself i'll start it in the morning go through my work day but if i'm excited by what i started in the morning i'll just work on it after work then because i've already got those juices flowing um and so i think figuring out a schedule for yourself is important there and experimenting with different ones until you find something that sticks yeah i think like i i've heard it described as as we have a like a reservoir of mental energy or willpower that we wake up with every day and like if we don't sleep enough that reservoir is is more empty when we start um so getting enough rest making sure that you are kind of taking care of yourself physically so that you can operate at the right level and then being aware of like what's taking those those like what's sapping that energy because there are a bunch of decisions that i don't realize drain me that drain me intensely like if i have to open up my fridge and choose what to eat like i'm like okay i have a bunch of ingredients i can cook four meals what am i gonna cook tonight that's actually like all of my side project energy trying to think of what i'm gonna cook so one of the ways that i've started hacking that is by making like a batch meal i'll make chili or curry or or something that i can make a lot of and then have ready so that i don't have to use that energy on my weeknights i can say okay i'm going to eat curry tonight because that's what's ready and then i'm going to work on my side project because i still have the gas in the tank to do that um and so you know what um let's see there are so many questions here that i want to make sure we want to get time for um but actually actually here's a question that i think is really interesting because everybody's routine is very different and everybody's got different like early bird night owl kind of routines what is your like typical day how do you split up your time among different projects and and work and all the other things that you do yeah and so i am one where i wake up and i go straight to work like so sometimes i will wake up 10 minutes before a meeting and just get straight to work go yeah yeah that's just how it is i wake up and it's time for work but then as soon as work is done i depending on how the day was depending on what i need to get done uh that's when i start planning out everything and and i do have a few projects where it's not just a side project for myself but it's something that i'm doing with others for example i write the stack overflow newsletter for that on on those days i need to make sure that i write that copy before a certain hour on a certain day of the week otherwise i will stay up all night just taking way too long to just write this dang copy and so i have to have a dedicated time for that in the afternoon um even even stuff the small things like writing tweets for work i have to have set times for that because otherwise i won't actually do it but then outside of that it if it's a project for myself or other things i'll kind of eat food and dawdle a little bit answering emails and stuff but then it kind of depends on what the project of the day is if it's me starting something new i actually almost never start a new project at my desk because with all of my monitors and stuff in front of me it's awesome because i can do so many things at once but when i want to start a brand new project i almost always go to a chair go to a couch or something and just sit with my laptop and focus because if i have this small screen in front of me with just like classical music in the background i can get all of my structure set up have my ideas written out have a notebook next to me to get it done and that's that's how i focus and then once i'm ready to like expand it a bit more that's when i go back to my desk and have the big stuff in front of me because otherwise i will play fortnite or something and and chat on discord and stuff and not actually get to work but typically that's that's that's the day if i'm starting a new project i'm away from my desk otherwise i'm playing games or working on something existing at my desk um yeah yeah i get that like if i if i even look at the tv my productivity is done for the day right i just i i always tell myself i'm like oh i'm going to watch one episode of the great british baking show before i go to bed or while i eat dinner and then i'm like a full season and a half and i'm like what have i done all those soggy bottoms yeah no yeah it's it's basically that and granted like pandemic work is different from remote work i just described a pandemic typical day outside of outside of that it totally depends because normally i see people and and i might go to an actual physical meetup and stuff there's there's a lot more uh there's a lot more things to do when there are things to do but when you're at home in a pandemic it's basically am i looking at a big screen or a medium screen or a small screen all the time i know i yeah that's i am very much looking forward to getting back to regular remote work and not pandemic work i know um so to to flip this on its head a little bit like you are you're very senior in your career you're uh you're a principal in your job now and you act as a you know you you do mentorship you've worked in hiring capacities you have led teams so i want to turn this a little bit the other way and i want to talk about like if you're looking for someone that you're going to give your time to or that you're going to give an opportunity to what have you seen that's helped somebody show that it's someone you want to invest that time into like how are people how are people making it visible that that they're somebody that you want to give that chance to first of all i it's one of my biggest pet peeves when someone dms and it's just like hey i'd like you to be my mentor i'll just that is not how this works i it's it's oh that drives me crazy because that relationship isn't real it's just you wanting something out of that person and so i think starting with a relationship first is key and and starting with that it often just involves a question and and i'll use an example of of a mentor of mine her name is kelly hoey she's awesome she wrote a book on networking um she is the person who i first met my junior year summer where i got her business card at a hackathon i emailed her hey it was nice to meet you i saw her at a few other events and stuff and slowly over time i would just email her on occasion saying kelly i really hope that you're well this is what i'm doing i'm graduating soon blah blah blah hey i'm in my first job i'm thinking about asking for a raise for the first time do you have any tips for me i kind of would just be present and stuff but i wouldn't ask anything of her except unless i had a very specific question right and over time we would actually start hanging out we would actually start meeting up and and she would say hey actually i need someone to speak at this event will you help me here and then sometimes i would say hey i actually need some advice in this regard can you help me here and it became kind of a twoway relationship it wasn't just me trying to get whatever i could out of her and a lot of times when i see mentorships fail it's because it's someone who just wants something out of a person and they're just like okay check in with me once a month to see how i'm doing and you can coach me as if it's as as if you're hiring them to do free labor and and that's that's not what mentorship is about mentorship is getting to know someone in a relationship a friendship where they just they just happen to be further ahead in in their career and there are so many people who i've mentored where we've never actually said the word mentorship before it's just it's just something where i happened to help them out a few times because they asked specific questions or they were in this chat room and they were saying hey would someone mind reviewing my resume and i would be just like yeah i got time i would do that and then we just kind of started talking more and more and that's just how it ended up being it it has to be a lot more natural than a mentorship proposal it's got to be some kind of some some kind of like actual back and forth and so when i'm when i'm looking for people to help out and everything i don't really actively seek out like who will be the next mentee of cassidy i don't i don't do anything like that will you accept this rose yeah no nothing like that uh it's it's truly just i hang out in chat rooms i'm i'm on twitter a lot and stuff and people will ask me questions on occasion and if it's if it's not like a full essay if it's because i get enough dms i can't read every essay that comes my way um i'll answer it and and sometimes we just chat a few times on occasion sometimes they'll send me their resume a couple times and stuff and then eventually we just kind of have this relationship where we're just chatting on occasion and i occasionally help them and then they'll retweet my stuff and and it becomes a little back and forth and so it i guess if you are looking for a mentor don't actively be just like who will be the one who will guide me just put have a presence in certain communities and kind of put out there that you're learning put out there that you want your resume looked at or that you're not sure what to do here occasionally post questions and as people start answering the questions the the mentors kind of come out of the fold quickly when you're in these kind of community discords for example um there are there are sometimes chats where people would just like hey does anybody know anything about this i i'm new to writing golang and i'm really curious about how this kind of stuff works as people answer your questions you can be just like okay great and then you can ask more questions again in the future eventually you'll see who keeps who continually replies you can occasionally dm them a really nice thank you saying thank you to people oh my god just say thank you it's huge it's so easy and it goes so far it goes so far there are so many times where i've just sent very simple thank you notes over email or something and people will reply back saying you know this is the first time someone's ever thanked me for this i i really appreciate it thank you like there's just it means so much to people to see that their efforts to help you didn't go unseen like you didn't just say thanks and then and then bounce yeah and so really just be be a giving person and be a be a grateful person and and be a part of your communities because the mentors will come out of the fold as you uh start helping and sometimes your mentor is the community and and it's it's just a group thing where you're helping each other you know that actually i think that hit so close to home for me because one of the things that i've realized as you know i i went from being somebody who was brand new to the industry i you know i lived in montana i didn't have any connections and i would see people who gave keynotes or who worked at the companies that i wanted to work at and i would think oh my god these must be like celebrities i remember thinking that paul irish probably like had a malibu mansion and and you know like was the and like he might but he but at the same time i don't i haven't met a single person in tech who's got a name who is walking around thinking like you know i'm pretty great everybody should well i guess i have met people like that but in general like there are there's nobody walking around going like i am a mentor and you are the mentees it's it's very much like there's a community and it it feels awkward to me when somebody says can you be my mentor because i don't feel like i am i don't feel like i'm qualified to do that i'm just a dude writing code um and like i know some things but i don't know way more things and so what i found is that when the community is built around this idea of knowledge share and like knowledge transfer and everybody is participating then it starts to become a really good like comentoring or just like cogrowth scenario as opposed to uh it doesn't it shouldn't be pedagogical like if i put together a workshop great come learn from me but if i'm just being a person i don't what i don't want to give lectures i don't want to like sit you down and try to teach you something i want to talk to you like a person like i want my online existence is about having friends not about having students and i think that that is um that's something that if if we can get out of the mindset of like there are people who are here and they're the rest of us down here it levels that playing field you can talk to somebody like a human and you have such a better chance if you just ask a question and then if you know something offer some advice and support um it's yeah i i and that that's actually something that i really like is you know you've got your your discord for like your twitch subscribers your patreon supporters and that's not like cassidy holding court it's hanging out with people right it truly is and and like there there have been some people who have when i've said oh my my patreon discord group is so great they're just like ah this is an interesting business model a thought leader letting people in on their deep secrets i'm just like no that's not what it is really it's just a great discord group where because there's a two dollar entrance fee quote unquote there's less spam that's that's truly that's truly what it is and and the group is so helpful to each other it's such a nice community and and people are are really really giving and and i think i think that is really really important to realize yeah all of these people who you think are up here they're just people they just have more dms that's that's all it really is that's such a good question yes absolutely that's exactly what it is same person worse dms um uh so i saw a couple good questions come in that i that i want to look at so because you've been involved with hiring developers what are the biggest mistakes that you've seen like what are the things that really like grind on you so you mentioned one of them like saying will you be my mentor but what what else have you seen oh i've seen i've seen so many things it just oh i've got stories out the wazoo some more extreme examples but for example an extreme example is one time someone applied to a job where i was reviewing the resumes and stuff after they had gone through a few loops i was like oh this resume looks good and i went to look at their personal website and it was my personal website like all they did was change the name and the bio but like it was my code they even kept my comments in and stuff and i was like what are you thinking and then uh there was one time where i was interviewing a person in person they were doing whiteboarding and they just started crying part way through and i felt i felt really bad and i know i know it's like high pressure and stuff but then when i tried to say here i can change the question or here's a kleenex or don't worry about it they would say no and then just put their hand up and wouldn't let me talk and we literally sat there in silence while they cried for 45 minutes whoa it was terrible so these are very extreme examples but i think they they are very very key to their they're indicative of certain things so first of all things that i don't like to see i don't like to see people who are not open for feedback if if you say no or something or someone's trying to help you out or something that's that is a red flag if someone's crying an interview in an interview i understand it is high pressure but don't take it out on the interviewer just just uh just be willing to take your time to get calm and then work on it again it's that that would have been fine but it was because of that reaction that it wasn't great um for for a personal website if you're gonna just straight up copy a personal website at least give credit don't take work and then pass it off as your own and then yes and that is that is something that oh it peeves me because i've seen that not just for myself but so many people where they they claim that they're like the world's best developer or whatever and then you see that their code is not their own it's it's frustrating and so really a lot of it is putting your ego at the door um don't be willing to get feedback be willing to admit both strengths and weaknesses um and what i really love in interviews is if i ask a question and someone like is working on and stuff and then they just admit they say honestly i'm not entirely sure how to do this normally this is something i would google i love that honesty so much i don't hold it against them at all because that's something that it's true there are times where i have to google the most basic javascript things even though i've been using javascript for like 15 years it sometimes you just need to google it and and so i love seeing that kind of honesty and and lack of ego and humbleness when you're in an interview setting yeah i i would just echo that a thousand times i think that's such a that's such an important thing is to just like you know again be a person like you're not selling the the 10 of your brain that knows programming you're selling your entire existence you're gonna be you know your your sense of humor you're gonna be your your strengths your weaknesses all of that stuff and showing that is what makes people feel like you're a human you know it's one of the things that i that i think is so um it's it's what makes someone online kind of magnetic it's why we follow certain accounts not because of you know because of their technical content like i follow a lot of people who write code that i don't understand they're java programmers or they they write you know they're doing machine learning stuff i don't do that i can't really follow their examples but oh my god do i love to watch them they're just so engaging they're so fun they're they're whole humans and that's actually kind of how i started following you was because of your uh your tick tock and so maybe this is a good question to to kind of end on but i feel like authenticity is a really loaded word right we we say that and it becomes more of a marketing term but in the sense of of you and your kind of existence as a human and online um how much do you think bringing all of yourself versus just the technical part has influenced your career i think the moment i started to bring more of myself out there is when my career really started to take off or not even my career just online presence and stuff in general like i've always been making silly videos and jokes since i was since i could operate a camcorder because i started on camcorders back in the day and and uh i i would always just like be silly with all kinds of things i was always into building cool stuff like mechanical keyboards but on my twitter on my facebook all over the place i only talked about code about a year and a half ago or whatever when i started making these funny videos and decided to tweet about them that's when suddenly my online presence just shot up that's when suddenly people were just like were actually following me and everything because it wasn't just coding content it was fun coding content it was humor it was me talking more about keyboard suddenly it was it was a bit more interesting to see and i think and i'm not trying to like toot my own horn like because i'm hilarious now i have hundreds of thousands of followers it's not that what i'm saying is by being authentic suddenly people actually cared what i had to say and i think that's really indicative of a lot when i see that people are tweeting about all kinds of things and they're not just sticking to tech i i love seeing that and it i've seen some people where like they'll tweet a picture with their kids and i've seen people reply saying uh stick to tech i follow you for tech news you don't want those kinds of followers anyway you have people who who want to get to know you and stuff and so and so ignore those people i love seeing people who talk about their interests outside of tech on the internet like granted i love seeing the technical content i will read almost every technical blog i can see and write things down and stuff so that way i can read more about it but when i see for example on your channel how you have your learn with jason stuff but you also talk about like cooking and everything i love learning about that and seeing what different interests people have i love seeing when people are interested in korean dramas because i can say oh have you seen this one yet or i love when people are interested in drawing because i would love to be a better artist but i'm just not and and just seeing how they draw and and use that side of their brain i think is so cool um when i when i follow people a lot of the people that i follow on twitter and on instagram and stuff they might be tech people but they're almost always something else they're they're rarely just someone who contributes to open source a lot and and it's because i appreciate seeing the authenticity of someone who doesn't just code all the time who's interested in other things and and it's cool to see the cool side projects and stuff don't get me wrong i love seeing when someone launches something cool coding wise but seeing people do other things and and put their whole self out there in the workplace and out of the workplace i think is very very huge uh and and i think is important because it allows you to have a worklife balance built in because you go to an employer and they know that this is who you are like i know a gal where she um she was working at yahoo and she reviewed operas on the side she's actually she she's an opera viewer like that is her side gig she she reviews operas around the world she's awesome and her every single job interview she talked about it because people know in her workplace if she says i have to be out of here by 4 pm today because i have to go to this opera they know this is her thing right and and so that is built into her schedule she has kind of a builtin worklife balance because she brought her whole self to the table online in the interview and and elsewhere and so i think it's really important to be authentic about that saying i'm a parent saying i like to build keyboards saying i like to stream or play video games and stuff being willing to put yourself there it it sets an expectation that work is not your life and and i think that's really important work is not your life is such a good ending point for this i think so i'm not even gonna try to follow that up so instead what i'm gonna say is thank you so so much for taking the time to hang out with us today and sharing all of this wonderful insight into who you are and and how we can take some inspiration from from what you've done to try to expand our own careers um what i am gonna do is i'm gonna drop a couple things here uh so for anyone who wants to you can find cassidy live on twitch at twitch.tv slash kassadoo or on twitter at twitter.comcassadoo and i believe you're cassadoo like everywhere right yeah yeah github codepen all of those things all of those things and uh and if you want to see more live content from me i'm going to be back with more episodes of connecting the dots every friday from now up until the holiday break and i also do a live stream at learnwithjason.dev that is a twitch live stream a couple times a week cassidy's been on it you can see past episodes that
