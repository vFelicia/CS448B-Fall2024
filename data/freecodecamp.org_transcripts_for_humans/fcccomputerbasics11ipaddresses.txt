00:00 - hi in this video we're going to be
00:02 - talking about the internet part one how
00:04 - the internet works to know how the
00:06 - internet works we're going to talk first
00:08 - about IP addresses you might be familiar
00:11 - with the fact that each of your devices
00:13 - has its own IP address just like a house
00:16 - or apartment has its own actual address
00:19 - the internet can't deliver data to a
00:20 - device unless it has an IP address not
00:23 - only does your device have an IP address
00:25 - but so does the modem and the router and
00:28 - every step along the way in the internet
00:30 - which we'll get to
00:31 - later IP addresses are determined based
00:34 - on location starting in five big
00:38 - International regions that's on this
00:40 - side as you get down the line each of
00:43 - these numbers brings you to a more
00:44 - specific location now this number isn't
00:47 - specific enough that you could call 911
00:49 - give them your IP address and they could
00:51 - find your house but it is specific
00:53 - enough where if you Google find the best
00:55 - ice cream sandwich near me Google can
00:58 - help you out there and actually give you
00:59 - some something close to your location
01:02 - what I want you to take away from this
01:03 - video is that every device that connects
01:05 - to the internet has an IP address and
01:08 - that it needs that IP address so the
01:10 - information knows where to go
