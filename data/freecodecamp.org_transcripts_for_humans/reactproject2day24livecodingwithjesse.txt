00:06 - hey everybody its Jesse and happy Monday
00:14 - I hope everyone had a good weekend
00:17 - I had a nice break from coding this
00:22 - weekend so I don't I don't think I did
00:24 - any coding at all except I help my wife
00:28 - with with some coding so she's doing she
00:32 - just started freaking camp so but other
00:35 - than that I had had a good break
00:39 - my oldest daughter just turned six what
00:44 - she's gonna turn six in a few days but
00:45 - we had her party on on Sunday so I'm all
00:51 - rested up and today I've been working on
00:56 - adding some security to our file uploads
01:00 - so the first thing I was trying to do
01:04 - was just to add a whitelist for file
01:07 - types so it's pretty predictable what
01:11 - gets uploaded I already can see what
01:14 - what everyone is uploaded over the last
01:18 - year I guess so I think it why twist
01:26 - would probably be the best way to go and
01:30 - I could probably add in some more things
01:33 - after that like limit the file size the
01:35 - number of files but when I was trying to
01:38 - do that I did all this research to try
01:41 - to figure out the best way to do it and
01:43 - then I couldn't get the server so we had
01:47 - one version of this site that was
01:50 - running on port 9000 and I couldn't get
01:54 - it to work and so now I'm going back
01:57 - through pool requests to see what has
02:00 - changed since the last time that I had
02:03 - that working so I'll show you what kind
02:07 - of errors I'm getting and see maybe
02:10 - maybe one of you
02:13 - have had a similar area before and can
02:17 - point me in the right direction here hey
02:22 - everyone I just check the live chat
02:24 - how's it going
02:26 - Ike so the the editor is actually Adam
02:30 - so it's the Adam editor from github with
02:34 - the SETI theme alright so let me show
02:39 - you the errors so this is what I'm
02:45 - getting I'll make it a little bigger I'm
02:49 - getting these errors I have there are
02:54 - some things on Stack Overflow and an
02:57 - issue on the create react app github
03:02 - repo that's people are having similar
03:06 - errors so I'm I'm just trying to
03:11 - troubleshoot that see the stream is
03:15 - started right in the middle of me doing
03:17 - the troubleshooting this is what I found
03:26 - so oops
03:29 - Thanks so someone had had a similar
03:33 - issue and after going back and forth a
03:37 - bit trying to figure out what the issue
03:38 - was this fixed it for them so in their
03:44 - package JSON they had their home page
03:47 - listed and I thought hey we did ever
03:53 - homepage changed it at one point so you
03:57 - could see on our package JSON we
03:59 - actually we have this as the home page
04:01 - and that was to get github pages working
04:05 - so I thought okay maybe it's that so I
04:07 - took out the home page and that didn't
04:10 - fix it I tried adding the home page in
04:14 - here like like it's been done here and
04:18 - that didn't work so now my my next
04:26 - my next idea is have a basically I just
04:35 - want to see what all has changed can I
04:37 - just take out some things and test it so
04:42 - I'm looking back into I guess this was
04:47 - the commit let me bring this over this
04:52 - is the commit where we added github
04:58 - pages support and so the only file
05:04 - changed basically is a package.json so
05:10 - it it shouldn't make a difference that
05:12 - we have these dependencies that all the
05:14 - only thing that change that would
05:16 - actually make any difference at all
05:19 - would be this home page thing and if we
05:23 - change yet this should be fine yeah
05:39 - hmm
05:47 - yeah so I'm kind of at a point where I
05:52 - guess I need to do some more research
05:55 - some I'm a little bit stuck here so
05:58 - unless someone has some ideas I probably
06:04 - just switch back to the main branch so I
06:07 - luckily wood started doing this on
06:10 - another branch because I well for number
06:13 - one it's good practice to do new things
06:17 - on another branch but I suspected that I
06:20 - might have something like this happened
06:22 - where I get stuck and so I'm just going
06:26 - to switch back to the master branch and
06:30 - work on some other stuff because for the
06:33 - live stream me reading through github
06:35 - issues is not going to be very exciting
06:40 - not not that my streams are supposed to
06:42 - be exciting or arcs I think that but
06:48 - it's definitely don't want to watch me
06:51 - read so the movies over in my other
06:56 - screen and work on them later and let's
07:00 - pull over this
07:10 - so you can see it's on the branch file
07:13 - type check and I should probably push
07:16 - that to github in case anyone wants to
07:18 - look at it so okay that's good that's
07:26 - what should be changed so I'm just
07:38 - committing this I'm adding the files and
07:40 - I'm committing it to our git repo and
07:43 - I'm at a commit message basically all I
07:54 - did was install a package called file
07:56 - type that reads a stream of your file
07:58 - coming in and it reached enough of it to
08:01 - give you the the file type and that was
08:05 - about as far as I got and I set up in
08:08 - the server JS file just a console log
08:12 - the file type just a test to make sure
08:14 - it was working and at that point that's
08:16 - when I realized that I needed to fix
08:20 - whatever was going on with with the
08:22 - server not being able to run okay so
08:26 - let's go
08:38 - there we go so now that's on github you
08:40 - can check out the little bit that I did
08:42 - do if you like and now we're back on the
08:49 - master branch so we should be able to
08:53 - just continue on and do some other
08:55 - things and then come back to that later
08:59 - on after I do similar research I'm gonna
09:03 - bring over my Pomodoro timer and okay
09:12 - cool so Patrick is testing this so
09:17 - thanks Patrick I I appreciate it all
09:25 - right so I'm going to start my timer and
09:32 - do some stuff I'm going to start the
09:34 - timer we'll check my Trello board and
09:37 - see what we can do
09:48 - okay so actually I think that's it guys
09:54 - spent for Pomodoro sessions on this
09:59 - today already
10:08 - alright so let's see what we need but
10:26 - okay let's do this
10:30 - because this will let me this would be a
10:33 - good way to introduce some of the
10:34 - changes from last pull request as well
10:36 - so Matt submitted a pull request with
10:41 - some good stuff in it it was pull
10:43 - request 52 if you want to check out
10:45 - everything to change some of the things
10:47 - that changed include using so setting
10:51 - state outside of the constructor we had
10:54 - a big kind of discussion and talking
10:57 - about what will the best practices were
10:59 - for that and so basically the conclusion
11:05 - is that it's okay to do that it's
11:07 - syntactic sugar you need you definitely
11:11 - need Babel which if you're writing stuff
11:14 - with reactive you're running that anyway
11:16 - so you just need to be able to have so
11:20 - this is we're talking about just setting
11:22 - state like this at least initially right
11:25 - you're we're still going to use set
11:27 - state you know anywhere down here you
11:31 - know which is what you should do but at
11:34 - least initially instead of doing the
11:36 - constructor we can do it like this
11:38 - so almost everywhere this is in change
11:42 - back to using this method which is you
11:47 - know a bit shorter a little bit cleaner
11:52 - something I can't remember all the other
11:54 - changes as well but that was one of the
11:56 - main changes was to change these back
12:01 - and also the other one of the other big
12:06 - changes and the one that we're going to
12:07 - work on right now
12:08 - on kind of improving even more is this
12:12 - this card so what Matt had done so what
12:19 - I had done previously was I wrapped this
12:22 - card in the paper component and I gave
12:29 - it a Z depth so in material UI you give
12:32 - you can give an item a paper component
12:36 - depth
12:37 - what I mean by depth in case you're not
12:40 - familiar with how this works in material
12:44 - design is let me pull this over
12:55 - something like this okay so on the
12:58 - posters page you can see each one of
13:01 - these cards has you know an apparent
13:03 - depth because of the shadow and then
13:06 - when I hover over it the depth changes
13:09 - or it changes apparently it seems as if
13:13 - the hovered card is closer than these
13:19 - other cars so that's what I mean by Z
13:22 - depth as in like the Z coordinate for
13:27 - talking like X Y Z so this is how you
13:32 - set the depth on the paper component so
13:35 - you can't do Z depth on card that's why
13:38 - I wrapped it in paper so I took away the
13:41 - black shadow from the card so I wouldn't
13:43 - have double shadows wrapped it in the
13:46 - paper component set the Z depth and I
13:50 - was checking for when the the mouse was
13:55 - going in and out and I was changing the
13:58 - state so the state in of death and
14:05 - [Applause]
14:06 - actually this isn't the new stuff
14:09 - actually this isn't bad Elvises right
14:14 - now because this will show you what we
14:15 - were doing and now it's changed so you
14:22 - can see I was just changing it from
14:23 - depth 1 to depth 2 but there were some
14:26 - some weird stuff going on it wasn't
14:30 - exactly the what I wanted so I'm not
14:34 - sure why they didn't update sometimes
14:36 - when I pull things and it doesn't auto
14:43 - update and Adam I have to close it and
14:45 - open it again so let's try that
14:53 - hmm
14:56 - okay it looks like it looks like Matt
15:00 - didn't remove these possibly we you know
15:03 - maybe he wasn't sure if I wanted to keep
15:07 - these to go back to it so he did remove
15:13 - the onmouseover and onmouseout from the
15:16 - actual component so it used to be on
15:19 - this paper component here okay so that's
15:22 - nice it is kind of nice though that we
15:24 - can see his side by side so instead of
15:25 - doing this Matt made a a clasp and what
15:31 - did he put this I think he put it on in
15:38 - the poster CSS file of the sass file
15:45 - yeah okay so he just uses CSS hover and
15:53 - he added that on on to this div so he
15:58 - wrapped everything in another div gave
16:01 - it a height of 100 percent and then is
16:08 - adding this this class name of
16:18 - yes it fix hey you see
16:25 - sorry I'm just checking this alliant
16:32 - yeah the fixed site just does the 100%
16:35 - height so basically what I want to do
16:39 - now is I think we can remove this paper
16:47 - element we can probably remove this div
16:53 - and just apply the styles directly to
17:00 - the card we may need to keep one Dev
17:07 - actually but we for sure we can remove
17:10 - the paper so I'm gonna go ahead and
17:11 - remove the paper now because we will not
17:16 - need that so let's remove that and we
17:25 - can get rid of paper here
17:30 - and now we can check this out just to
17:34 - verify I thought we could remove a paper
17:43 - telling you know I know what's happening
17:46 - okay so that the paper was where we were
17:49 - getting the initial state from which is
17:52 - fine we don't need that because we could
17:55 - just take this off of the card
18:13 - we take that off the card and the card
18:26 - we need to add the
18:36 - we can add fixed side
19:04 - yeah
19:06 - okay so that gives us
19:13 - pretty much the same effect but it's not
19:20 - it's not exactly what I want so let me
19:23 - pull in so hopefully you'll be able to
19:29 - see the comparison so this is on
19:30 - materialized and this is how their
19:35 - effect works and we'll compare that to
19:40 - what's going on here so there's
19:47 - definitely a difference there's a
19:53 - difference in the shadow and and it
20:00 - seems in the transition it seems like
20:03 - the transition is just slightly slower
20:04 - here the shadow is longer not quite as
20:09 - dark this one is shorter and more dark
20:11 - so I want to switch this to use the
20:17 - shadow you know more like this on hover
20:20 - and so as far as I know materialised
20:24 - doesn't have just a class a hover class
20:27 - or I'm sorry material UI doesn't have
20:30 - just a hover class it's possible that I
20:32 - missed it but in looking through the
20:34 - documentation for cards
20:37 - there wasn't an option just to make the
20:39 - card hover Abul so in materialise there
20:43 - is so I'm just gonna import the styles
20:47 - from materialized and apply them to
20:50 - these cars
21:11 - okay
21:15 - alright so I just checked the live chat
21:18 - quickly and have some more info about
21:20 - the air ok thanks so matt matt has some
21:26 - input as well
21:29 - so patrick it was working on port 3000
21:33 - it was port 9000 that I couldn't get it
21:37 - just came up with a blank page and had
21:39 - some errors
21:51 - all right so let's just change change
21:58 - the hover a bit and possibly see if we
22:02 - can even get rid of this this other div
22:06 - and just slim things down just a bit
22:21 - so what I was thinking
22:24 - initially was I could just get rid of
22:26 - this and set the styles set the styles
22:37 - for the box shadow it's a nun like I had
22:41 - before the problem is I'd have to use
22:44 - I'd either have to do it in line in that
22:47 - case anything I do here one wouldn't
22:49 - work it would get canceled out by this
22:53 - or I could do here and then put
22:56 - important which I'm gonna try to do but
22:59 - I vaguely remember trying this before
23:01 - and if you're using important the hover
23:05 - style just got automatically applied it
23:08 - was kind of odd I'm gonna try it again
23:09 - but maybe I'm remembering wrong and
23:12 - it'll work but that's the plan so
23:13 - basically we're going to use this hub
23:16 - herbal class but we're going to bring in
23:18 - the base card shadow from materialize
23:23 - and also the transition so basically
23:27 - everything that they use in materialize
23:30 - for their card hover we're going to
23:33 - bring that in as well and we're just
23:38 - going to try to override what's going on
23:41 - here
23:47 - so I think I have the the code from
23:53 - material as yep since we've been
23:57 - borrowing so heavily from materialize I
23:59 - just leave their repo open
24:25 - okay just not in this one just get back
24:29 - to components I don't remember which one
24:35 - I was on before their evils okay we'll
24:39 - try out cards
24:51 - okay z-depth which ice I figured z-depth
24:56 - would be in variables but maybe it has
24:58 - its own no it doesn't
25:06 - this will try again maybe I know it's
25:13 - not there
25:43 - it's probably in global there we go
26:00 - okay so we want to grab this I guess
26:05 - I'll just grab the whole thing like
26:06 - since we're using sass anyway we'll put
26:09 - it in that format okay
26:15 - and the initial card
26:33 - zyne up for one okay
27:13 - okay and I don't think I don't think we
27:20 - need this extend
27:26 - we'll see we'll leave it in for now
27:29 - Susie that's one and
27:57 - all right so we need to put in let's try
28:06 - it
28:07 - we'll try taking this out first like I
28:11 - said I hopefully we can make it work
28:13 - like that and then it would just make
28:17 - the component a bit smaller let's see
28:26 - where's my clothes I'm not sure what
28:30 - classes I'm already passing in
28:56 - hmm
29:02 - I guess I'm not I don't think I'm even
29:06 - using this anywhere to have the classes
29:10 - here
29:23 - oh wow
29:26 - can you check
29:28 - I'm gonna check my time okay we have
29:30 - five minutes so five minutes I'm gonna
29:32 - go to the to the live chat and catch up
29:35 - on everything that's going on so if here
29:36 - so if you ask me questions or anything
29:38 - I'm not I'm not ignoring you at least
29:41 - forever okay well let me check just to
29:50 - make sure okay
29:52 - so good so far let's let's give this
30:05 - these for testing let's just call this
30:11 - card oops
30:17 - and hopefully my doing let's give it a
30:23 - see dad one and
30:39 - actually
30:47 - classes however so let's go
30:57 - actually how do I add what's the best
31:03 - way to add in classes that I'm
31:06 - hard-coding but then also be able to put
31:08 - in some classes as well so obviously I
31:12 - need this classes but then I want to add
31:16 - in these can I
31:27 - I don't think I can do that we'll just
31:29 - we'll see find out all right I didn't do
31:38 - what I wanted it to do but let's see
31:40 - what classes end up on here
31:49 - undefined card see there's one okay
32:27 - okay so Matson use template literal
32:30 - syntax okay cool
32:33 - I like template little syntax anyway
32:36 - yeah oops
32:45 - so I know we've gone over template
32:48 - literal syntax a bunch of times but in
32:50 - case you didn't see any of that or you
32:54 - know you're not familiar with it let's
32:57 - let me just explain it since it is it's
33:00 - not like old-school JavaScript I guess
33:05 - so this is not es5 this is es6 stuff so
33:07 - when we use backticks instead of double
33:11 - quotes of single quotes this is a string
33:14 - that you can do JavaScript inside of so
33:18 - if you want to do JavaScript you just
33:20 - put dollar sign curly bracket and then
33:24 - anything inside these brackets is
33:26 - treated as JavaScript so we this classes
33:30 - is not a string it's a variable so it'll
33:35 - pool in whatever the value of classes is
33:37 - and then everything else is to string
33:41 - other cool things we can do with there
33:43 - like like this works you can have spaces
33:47 - and stuff in between so really cool very
33:52 - useful way better than having to put a
33:55 - bunch of plus signs and lots of quotes
34:01 - so anyway thanks Matt so this should say
34:07 - yeah so now this is spaced out although
34:09 - it does say undefined and I don't want
34:11 - it to say undefined so what am I doing
34:13 - wrong
34:49 - oh I never changed that wait no I don't
34:56 - need to change that what am I thinking
34:58 - yeah so I'm pulling in should be pulling
35:01 - in classes
35:12 - oh well my timers up so let me take five
35:18 - minutes and go through the live chat not
35:23 - a whole lot in the live chat yet so
35:26 - shouldn't take too long may not even use
35:28 - up the whole five minutes so you have
35:32 - air drifters hi from San Diego awesome
35:38 - welcome and thanks for joining in in the
35:42 - live chat
35:58 - okay so update on the port 9000 err so
36:03 - Patrick was able to recreate that error
36:09 - yes it's a cryptic error yeah the error
36:12 - just doesn't it's not super helpful okay
36:23 - well at least I guess I feel better that
36:26 - you can duplicate the air and it's not
36:31 - just something on my machine
36:36 - Sebastian Xavier says I think coding is
36:39 - cool I just started learning HTML and a
36:41 - little bit of JavaScript
36:42 - I took a week-long class too that's
36:45 - awesome
36:46 - and welcome to coding yeah so hopefully
36:52 - you're you're able to follow at least
36:54 - some of what we're doing so I know now
36:58 - if you just you know you're doing a
36:59 - little bit of JavaScript you may not
37:02 - know figure out you know everything
37:04 - that's going on here but little things
37:06 - like template literal syntax that'll be
37:10 - kind of a cool some cool syntax that
37:15 - will save you some time that you might
37:18 - not get in maybe like beginning
37:20 - JavaScript courses
37:34 - okay so Matt's given some advice as well
37:39 - on this
38:00 - okay so did I have
38:18 - so I guess I was before classy
38:29 - anyway
38:31 - cool okay it's a Sebastian's a versus I
38:33 - know the basics yeah so anyway so
38:35 - hopefully it's you can you can follow
38:37 - along with some of it depending on what
38:42 - I'm doing for you know for one of these
38:46 - it may be more beginner friendly you
38:52 - know we just do we would own everything
38:54 - we need to do to build you know a whole
38:56 - site so some of them will be really
39:00 - basic and some streams will be a little
39:02 - bit more advanced
39:28 - all right so I am through with
39:30 - everything in the live chat for now
39:33 - early which that's crazy normally I
39:36 - always go over and so I am going to set
39:42 - my reset my timer to twenty five minutes
39:45 - so I'm gonna do at least one more twenty
39:48 - five minute session and then we'll see
39:51 - how much is in the live chat I don't
39:53 - think I'm gonna do a third one we'll see
39:57 - I do want to make sure that I get out of
39:59 - here and enough time to take my son to
40:02 - his karate class so may wrap things up a
40:08 - bit earlier
40:09 - we'll still definitely have an hour-long
40:10 - stream today though
40:24 - all right so on my other screen I'm
40:26 - gonna bring up I'm gonna bring up what
40:35 - that generic card component was since
40:39 - I've changed it and I don't I don't want
40:41 - to undo everything just to see what I
40:44 - would I change so
40:57 - because I think I changed some stuff
40:59 - that I shouldn't and that's why I'm
41:00 - having some problems
41:20 - okay so I actually did have
41:31 - hmm
41:36 - so initially I think it was like this
41:39 - and that's where I was pulling it in so
41:42 - I never really needed to change these
41:46 - well I guess I guess it didn't really
41:51 - matter so but originally on the
41:54 - outermost div this is what was being
41:57 - pulled in I always did have classes here
42:00 - to just pass down the classes right to
42:03 - the card component but this makes sense
42:08 - to do it like this so let's see
42:21 - all right cool so now we are getting
42:23 - hoverball which is what we want cards
42:26 - you have okay great so now let's make
42:29 - this work why isn't this working what
42:37 - did I do
43:07 - alright so I'm gonna try this with this
43:11 - is gonna look terrible the first
43:24 - so I'm just gonna confirm that this is
43:26 - working yet okay
43:35 - I was great know how
43:50 - let's see if this works yep all right
43:54 - great so whatever I was worried about at
43:57 - the beginning I don't know what I was
43:59 - thinking but this definitely does work
44:01 - great
44:02 - all right so now we can see it's
44:04 - definitely a different a different
44:06 - effect okay so I I wanted to switch it
44:14 - up to this for for a few reasons mainly
44:17 - because this is consistent with what
44:21 - I've been doing with all my other sites
44:24 - so while I do want to use material UI
44:27 - for react sites going forward maybe
44:32 - probably I'll use the newest version for
44:35 - the next site I do but I I do want the
44:40 - styles to match because you know we have
44:45 - some sites that it's going to be a while
44:47 - before they get redone so I do want to
44:49 - keep it consistent so in little details
44:51 - like this it's not really a big deal
44:54 - especially since there's not built in
44:57 - hover mechanism I think it's okay to go
45:03 - with materialise and the way they do it
45:07 - all right but I think that's it it looks
45:10 - more smooth I kind of like how the
45:13 - shadows a bit more spread out I'm not so
45:15 - I don't know it just seemed abrupt I
45:19 - guess that it was so dark underneath
45:22 - here so anyway that that works so I'd
45:30 - say that that was best-case scenario
45:31 - here so you know over here we added in a
45:34 - bit more CSS but the component itself
45:40 - we're able to get rid of four lines in
45:43 - this component so it's not bad also we
45:49 - can remove this because we're no longer
45:53 - we no longer need to use that because
45:55 - that was here so that's five lines and
45:59 - we got rid of our import for paper it's
46:01 - a sick
46:02 - lines so we remove six lines that's cool
46:05 - so six lines from that component and
46:08 - we've imported this now what I'd like to
46:10 - do is have this in a different file
46:18 - right because I'm not just going to use
46:19 - this for posters so I think we should
46:34 - actually all of this should be should be
46:41 - used so I think I'm just gonna take all
46:44 - of this and I'm gonna put it in
46:50 - something that gets loaded up a bit
46:54 - higher so maybe you're in our app yeah
47:01 - so these are more I guess like utility
47:05 - classes so like this this video line you
47:08 - know so I'm gonna move that up here I
47:16 - think it makes more sense to be here
47:19 - since cards are so common in material
47:23 - design and we use cards on a lot of
47:25 - different pages
47:27 - oops okay so for right now at least you
47:38 - don't have anything in posters so let's
47:44 - see I I don't know that I will add
47:46 - anything any special styles and posters
47:50 - so I may just get rid of this file
47:56 - completely
48:04 - let's get rid of these and then let's
48:06 - get rid of it
48:08 - oops now I wasn't importing it there I
48:10 - was importing it in posters actually now
48:21 - that I think about it since some of what
48:25 - we're doing applies to the flight of
48:28 - cards I guess it doesn't apply to just
48:31 - cards so we could add potentially we can
48:33 - add hover ball as a class to anything
48:37 - and make it horrible so I'm for a second
48:41 - I thought about making some a SAS file
48:45 - for this generic card component and
48:47 - moving the styles into that but now I'm
48:50 - I'm gonna leave it where it is I don't I
48:54 - can't think of anything right now that I
48:56 - would use hover go on but at least in
49:01 - materialize it is separate and you can
49:04 - use it on more than just cards so I'll
49:06 - leave it as is for now and that'll keep
49:12 - us from making more more files so all
49:17 - right so now all told we've removed
49:20 - seven lines of code between the two of
49:23 - these components we've removed two files
49:28 - we have added a bit on to our app dot s
49:33 - CSS file so
49:41 - let's say not bad I'm happy with that
49:43 - result and that took while way less than
49:50 - anticipated so it's great so what was
49:55 - that I'm gonna say 1.5 so I guess not
50:01 - way less I forgotten I'd already done
50:04 - one Pomodoro psycho on this before okay
50:07 - but still under the amount of time that
50:11 - I expected so while we're on this
50:15 - generic card we may as well go to the
50:19 - home page and add that to some of the
50:23 - home cards so these two kind of go
50:30 - together so we'll work on both of these
50:33 - I'm gonna move this over here until I
50:37 - get some more ideas about it mmm not I'm
50:45 - not gonna try to add the icons right now
50:47 - I'm still not exactly sure how I want to
50:49 - do that okay so let's go to the home
50:54 - page I'm gonna move this over here and
51:00 - do this
51:08 - okay so here's our our home view and
51:15 - here's where we're bringing in our
51:20 - generic cards and we want to instead of
51:25 - doing it like this we want to do it more
51:28 - like this so we want to bring in hover
51:34 - Balazs well actually in link writes have
51:44 - horrible and link and actually let me
51:50 - show you the home page in case you
51:52 - haven't seen it before
51:53 - so here's our home page right now so you
51:56 - see we don't have hover over any of
51:58 - these I'm clicking on all of them and
52:00 - they're not linked ship but they all
52:02 - need to link to something so some of
52:05 - them are actually going to go they're
52:07 - just going to be a file download so the
52:10 - PowerPoint will be the brand manual will
52:12 - be but then these four will link to
52:15 - other places other views within this
52:18 - site and and this is at is not the final
52:26 - version of this page I realized it's
52:28 - very plain looking I guess
52:46 - so we need to go to where the data is so
52:51 - this is kind of really nice how this is
52:53 - set up is because this is all pulling in
52:57 - data and then everything's set up kind
53:00 - of as props to do different things in
53:02 - this component converting these cards
53:05 - over is going to be really easy we just
53:07 - need to change things in the way the
53:10 - data is set up and pulled in which is
53:13 - really cool that was our goal from the
53:15 - beginning with this generic card
53:16 - component was something that could do
53:18 - anything you would want a card to do I
53:20 - mean within reason just by passing in
53:23 - different props alright so let me see
53:28 - let's find our data and we want to pull
53:33 - our poster data up here and
53:45 - links data yep this is it okay so we
53:55 - just need to add huh verbal true.really
53:58 - to everything so
54:07 - hmm
54:12 - actually these already say linked to
54:21 - so that's all right I suppose if we just
54:23 - changed this to link that we should be
54:26 - fine oh you know what
54:30 - I'm sorry these are the side nav side
54:35 - nav links so sorry if you hear that
54:37 - noise it's my phone going off I don't
54:39 - recognize the number I'm not going to
54:40 - answer it but it's sound vibrated there
54:52 - we go that's what we want okay yeah so
55:00 - let's pull in huh verbal and also like
55:07 - audible both of these in now just to get
55:09 - him in there
55:21 - I guess so I'm gonna put them on the
55:24 - bottom
55:43 - okay
55:55 - let's let's pull up that links data
55:57 - again because we can use a lot of this
56:04 - request
56:10 - shares story
56:37 - this isn't just posters this will be
56:39 - logos logos posters what did I name that
56:46 - page
57:07 - those posters
57:11 - I think that's what I had it as manual
57:16 - and then the other two I'll just leave
57:18 - like this for now I'm not sure where
57:23 - those files are actually gonna be so
57:27 - when I find that out I can just put the
57:30 - data in whoops
57:43 - okay
57:52 - hmm
58:07 - okay what am I not bringing in
58:14 - oh I forgot to actually pass those props
58:19 - okay so car title
59:01 - there we go
59:07 - that works great let's see I do want to
59:11 - check alright great so that is did we
59:20 - never make this view I guess we didn't I
59:26 - thought I had me put in the content for
59:28 - all the views but I guess I missed one
59:30 - so I'll make that one yeah this one's
59:39 - really easy it's just two cards
60:06 - okay actually kind of don't like that
60:10 - you have to click this and then click
60:12 - another spot to go in there
60:13 - it would it would be nicer if maybe I
60:18 - just had logos posters and you could
60:21 - click to go under one of the other and
60:24 - then it wouldn't match the rest of the
60:25 - cards unless I had other things down
60:28 - here
60:30 - I'm not sure let me know what you think
60:32 - it's one extra click and I guess I do
60:36 - get the chance to put more information
60:38 - about the logos and the posters on the
60:40 - second page the only reason I combined
60:42 - them was because I just I didn't want
60:44 - one extra hanging down here but I guess
60:52 - we do have
60:57 - we have the tutorial if I can think of
61:01 - one more thing to put here the glossary
61:05 - I guess then we could have nine that
61:11 - might work let me know what you think
61:13 - about that would it be too much instead
61:16 - of six to have nine of them split out
61:20 - logos and posters have the tutorial
61:23 - visible right away and have the glossary
61:26 - visible
61:33 - yeah that might work and before when I
61:38 - had these large icons that would have
61:40 - been too much but now it will definitely
61:46 - fit and I'll make the page look a bit
61:49 - less dull okay all right see about three
61:58 - and a half minutes left for this
62:01 - Pomodoro session since we finished that
62:07 - so this was I guess the the smallest I
62:14 - can put in is a half so I'll put in a
62:16 - half for both of these but really it
62:19 - took less than a half of a session if
62:23 - you're not familiar with Pomodoro
62:25 - sessions and things this is just a way
62:27 - of breaking up your time of working and
62:30 - estimating what you do so you take a
62:32 - five-minute break every 25 minutes after
62:34 - four sessions a ten-minute break there
62:36 - may be other ways to do that that's just
62:38 - the way that I learned and the the
62:45 - estimation comes in where you try to
62:47 - estimate beforehand how many Pomodoro
62:49 - sessions it will take to do something
62:51 - and then after you do it you put how
62:52 - many it actually did take then you can
62:54 - get a good idea of whether you know how
62:56 - long projects will take after you do it
62:58 - for a while you get pretty good at
63:00 - estimating so right now I'm you know
63:02 - these numbers are pretty close when I
63:04 - first started doing it my numbers would
63:05 - be very different I usually would
63:09 - overestimate now I'm a lot better at
63:14 - that and that's really good
63:17 - it's good for time management personally
63:19 - but it's also good if you're freelancing
63:22 - to give have an accurate idea of how
63:25 - long projects will take so that you can
63:27 - figure out pricing so very very helpful
63:32 - it's been very helpful for me to keep me
63:34 - on track I've been doing this system for
63:35 - over a year now
63:42 - alright oops and I meant to look at
63:45 - another thing I don't know I get
63:49 - anything else done in three minutes it's
63:51 - probably two and a half by now oops
63:58 - actually we can clean this up a bit so
64:00 - Matt already did this so I'm gonna just
64:03 - put that and done since I have no idea
64:06 - how long it took Matt and I am NOT I
64:08 - really I don't want to require
64:10 - contributors to check their time as well
64:12 - anything done in a pull request I'm just
64:14 - gonna pull over and put nothing there so
64:17 - that way I'll know if I see something
64:20 - like this immediately they all know I
64:22 - didn't do this this was from full
64:23 - request okay not bad getting through a
64:31 - lot of to do's I know this list isn't
64:33 - complete I'm sure there'll be other
64:34 - things I'll see to add to this but not
64:37 - bad we cut this about in half from what
64:39 - it was earlier in the day okay
64:51 - let me
65:16 - so it's just regular get add get commit
65:20 - just like we did earlier so as soon as
65:27 - that finishes I'm going to push this to
65:28 - github so that you all have access to
65:31 - everything that we just did make sure
65:37 - there was one other thing that I think
65:39 - we could take out now so I'm pretty sure
65:47 - pretty sure we're not using horrible
65:50 - anymore
65:53 - yeah we're I think we're not using hub
65:55 - herbal and since we're not using all
65:57 - this I'll probably remove all this let's
66:07 - just remove this right now
66:10 - so I don't forget so you don't need
66:13 - hover bowl and we don't need it was it
66:19 - in posters so we don't need it here
66:30 - and we don't need any of this
66:39 - and since we don't need that we don't
66:42 - need debounce or we're getting rid of
66:44 - you in more lines it's just great we
66:48 - don't need this oops
66:57 - actually do we need any of this now I
67:00 - don't think so
67:08 - I'm scared of this
67:21 - I just saw Blake said his fan is loud I
67:24 - actually don't have my fan on right now
67:26 - maybe my computer is lovin yeah for some
67:31 - reason I didn't notice it cuz I had
67:33 - music playing in my headphones but yeah
67:38 - my computer is a bit louder than normal
67:41 - it's normally pretty quiet let's see
67:55 - I think that's all we can remove but
68:02 - that's pretty good and we can also
68:12 - that's all I'm gonna do right now I'm
68:15 - thinking can we change this into
68:17 - functional component probably all right
68:27 - so Oh
68:35 - and I just changed this hold on
68:58 - so let me go to the live chat and see
69:01 - what's going on if you aren't familiar
69:04 - with how this stream goes the end of the
69:08 - stream is saved for question and answers
69:10 - so we have a little intro some coding
69:13 - and then question answer Wow I messed
69:17 - something up
69:33 - let's and then the that we do some code
69:37 - and then the last part is question
69:38 - answer so if you don't want to stick
69:40 - around for the question and answer
69:41 - session then thanks for watching and
69:46 - I'll be back tomorrow hopefully you can
69:49 - join in again otherwise please put your
69:51 - questions in the live chat now and I'll
69:55 - just go straight from the top of the
69:56 - live chat and go through all the
69:58 - questions try to answer as many as I can
70:00 - if you can't stick around to hear your
70:02 - question answered you can always catch
70:04 - the recording of this that's available
70:06 - on free code camp or you could just ask
70:10 - me some other way like on Twitter or any
70:14 - social media network where you can find
70:16 - me interrupted depth of thumb okay I
70:22 - must not have gotten rid of everything
70:51 - actually yeah we did have depth we were
70:55 - using the z-depth in here what we
71:20 - hmm
71:26 - all right but I think we can get rid of
71:28 - this safely without without needing it
71:37 - so let's let's see
71:43 - okay so that those still work great so
71:47 - hopefully if anyone notices any bugs
71:49 - with that because of how much was
71:51 - changed I mean I certainly didn't test
71:53 - it thoroughly but everything should work
71:56 - and all right so let's see what it says
72:04 - now
72:11 - so while that's running I'm gonna try to
72:15 - find some questions
72:21 - Chris Chung says can I do this on a
72:23 - Chromebook you certainly could do this
72:25 - on a Chromebook you would have to use
72:28 - some type of cloud editor like cloud
72:31 - nine I can't remember I've used some
72:36 - other ones before but I can't remember
72:37 - the name so if you check out I think the
72:40 - website c9 dot IO that would work
72:44 - basically you just need an environment
72:46 - where you can run well you can run all
72:52 - the stuff that you need to run so you
72:53 - need to be able to bring in NPM packages
72:55 - and things like that so cloud 9 can do
72:59 - that and there are alternatives so I I
73:03 - have developed on a Chromebook before
73:07 - and it works basically in the same way
73:11 - as long as you only have a good cloud
73:15 - development environment I say it says
73:23 - can you get a job with just knowing
73:25 - front-end yeah yeah for sure so I mean
73:31 - I'm a front-end developer right now I do
73:33 - know a little bit more than front-end I
73:35 - do have to do some back-end stuff and
73:37 - DevOps stuff from time to time because
73:39 - we don't have other people to do that
73:41 - here but there are plenty of jobs for
73:45 - front-end developers if you check out
73:49 - Stack Overflow jobs you'll see a lot or
73:52 - really any any job get github as their
73:55 - own job thing but I see it son of
73:59 - front-end jobs on Stack Overflow pretty
74:04 - much every time I'm on there it shows me
74:07 - front-end jobs
74:14 - Patrick I see you told me not to forget
74:16 - the commas I knew someone had you have
74:19 - seen that in the live chat wants us
74:25 - Andrea says great when I'm watching this
74:28 - video I can study coding and learn
74:30 - English at the same time well that's
74:31 - that's awesome I had never thought that
74:34 - someone could learn English while
74:36 - watching this but that's cool glad I can
74:39 - help in any way
74:46 - Rohan says late yet again well at least
74:48 - you made it before it was over this time
74:54 - yang John says hi hey how's it going
74:58 - thanks for watching John Henson says
75:02 - Jessie yes
75:04 - add more to that dole page yeah for sure
75:09 - okay Blake sorry Blake Blake had said
75:12 - that my fan was loud and I commented on
75:15 - a few minutes ago thinking that he meant
75:17 - my my office fan which I did I was
75:20 - running you know when it got really hot
75:23 - in here earlier in the summer but he
75:27 - actually did meet my computer fan so
75:29 - sorry about that and actually quieted
75:34 - down huh I can't hear it at all so I
75:38 - don't know what was going on I mean you
75:40 - all saw what I was going it's not like I
75:42 - had anything open or closed it but
75:45 - whatever occasionally my computer has
75:49 - just been like the fan just kicks into
75:51 - high gear and it's just super loud for a
75:53 - few minutes and then it's okay Blake
75:59 - says c9i Oh does require credit card but
76:03 - it's refundable and it's either zero a
76:06 - $1 charge said he did it the other day
76:10 - and it was not a problem at all yeah
76:13 - that's true I always forget that when I
76:16 - started cloud 9 they didn't require a
76:18 - credit card but then they changed their
76:20 - policy afterwards and you do need a
76:22 - credit card to sign up even if you're
76:24 - just going there
76:25 - plan they just wanted I did continent
76:30 - get I like kind of I kind of think
76:32 - cloud9 got bought out by somebody and
76:34 - then the policy switch but I can't
76:36 - remember exactly what would happen with
76:38 - that J Evans asked hey Jesse what was
76:49 - your time management solution again okay
76:51 - yeah I'll go over this time management
76:54 - solution so basically it's it's a
76:57 - Pomodoro Technique and so I have this
77:01 - Pomodoro timer so it's a 25-minute
77:03 - session five-minute breaks every four
77:07 - sessions I take a long break of ten
77:10 - minutes okay so that's the time this is
77:14 - just tomato timer calm that's tomato -
77:20 - timer calm there's so many Pomodoro
77:22 - timers out there and in fact I think I
77:25 - think it's one of the lessons in free
77:27 - code camp to make your own Pomodoro
77:29 - timer so I'm sure there are thousands it
77:33 - probably tens of thousands of Pomodoro
77:35 - timers available out there but that use
77:40 - that for my timer and then I have this
77:43 - is just Trello and it's a free project
77:47 - management solution and I set things up
77:53 - like like this it doesn't come set up
77:56 - like this automatically so but I so I
77:59 - create these these cards these columns
78:02 - of to do ready for development in
78:04 - progress testing done and wish list
78:06 - wishlist is just stuff that I'd like to
78:10 - have that isn't necessary to complete
78:12 - the project but if I get time I'll put
78:15 - them in the other ones are pretty
78:17 - self-explanatory so when I go to create
78:21 - a new task I try to break the tasks down
78:26 - as small as possible and
78:29 - I create the task and then I add a
78:34 - number and that number is how many
78:38 - Pomodoro sessions so how many 25-minute
78:40 - sessions I think it will take me to
78:42 - complete this now that there are other
78:44 - ways of doing this some people I've I've
78:46 - heard some people do like complexity so
78:50 - the number doesn't represent time it
78:52 - represents complexity so I'm not to that
78:55 - point yet maybe I'll switch over to
78:58 - something like that but for now this
79:00 - this works for me now after I complete
79:06 - this I would actually put how many
79:08 - points it took so let's say it only took
79:09 - me three I have three in there so now
79:12 - these two numbers get compared so if I
79:16 - were to move this over here you can see
79:19 - it tells me you know five was what I
79:24 - estimated and three is what it really
79:26 - was and you can see it just adds that up
79:28 - on the top so I can see very quickly
79:33 - since it's still in progress this means
79:35 - I'm not done so if I look at this I
79:37 - would say okay I need about three more
79:38 - sessions to go until I'm done with this
79:40 - column I can you know I can look in here
79:43 - and say okay five more sessions I'm done
79:45 - with my entire project assuming that I
79:46 - already had laid out all the two dues
79:48 - and then at the end I can look and say
79:50 - it took me this many sessions to
79:52 - complete or this many sessions to
79:54 - complete so it was either I was ahead of
79:57 - schedule either overestimate or
79:59 - underestimated but I can tell all of
80:01 - that and on my next project I can go
80:04 - back in and check and say okay well this
80:06 - took me this long last time so I would
80:10 - have a good idea how long it's going to
80:11 - take me the next time so that's how I do
80:14 - it it's um it's been pretty useful you
80:21 - definitely have to be consistent with it
80:23 - for it to be useful but I found that the
80:28 - the five minute breaks are really nice
80:33 - because sometimes it's easy like if you
80:37 - have these for me when I have a problem
80:39 - I'm working on like a bug
80:41 - or something and I can't get it to work
80:43 - I just get so into it you all get buried
80:46 - and documentation and trying to search
80:48 - through things and it's easy for me to
80:51 - waste you know hours trying to look into
80:54 - this but if I take that five minute
80:57 - break it just forces me to take a step
80:59 - back and say look back at my Trello
81:02 - Trello board mark another Pomodoro
81:06 - session and then I can see the big
81:07 - picture again and at that little bit of
81:11 - time that few minutes allows me to just
81:14 - think okay is this super-important can I
81:18 - just switch to something else and get
81:19 - something done and then come back to
81:22 - that when I have a better idea of of
81:24 - what I want to do and sometimes that's
81:27 - that's the best thing to do at the time
81:29 - I switch it up I get some stuff done I
81:32 - feel a little bit accomplished and then
81:35 - later on some idea comes to me that I
81:38 - can try so instead of just spinning my
81:41 - wheels or not getting anything done I'm
81:43 - way more productive so it doesn't always
81:45 - work out like that but it's happened
81:47 - enough that you know this has definitely
81:50 - been worth it for me and very useful so
81:53 - anyway hopefully that was a decent
81:55 - enough explanation there is a I learned
81:58 - this in a course on Pluralsight so I had
82:01 - like a free three-month subscription to
82:03 - Pluralsight at one time and there was a
82:06 - course on I think the course was called
82:09 - agile for one so it was talking about
82:13 - agile technique but in in that course it
82:17 - was talking about the Pomodoro Technique
82:18 - and Kanban boards which this is actually
82:20 - I not Pomodoro this is Kanban so anyway
82:25 - it was combining several different
82:27 - techniques and trying to adapt it so
82:32 - that someone who's not on a team could
82:34 - work in a way that's closer to how agile
82:38 - teams work I mean you can't replicate it
82:40 - with one person but it it definitely
82:44 - helped me like I said I've been using it
82:45 - for over a year now and definitely liked
82:50 - it a little bit more work to set up at
82:51 - the beginning but it's nice
82:54 - I let's see let me get there's a few
82:59 - more comments here almost to the bottom
83:01 - oh sorry
83:03 - Jay had a follow-up question about the
83:06 - number system for Trello that yes so
83:08 - that's actually a chrome add-on called
83:11 - scrum for Trello yeah I'm pretty sure
83:16 - that's the name of it let me check I'm
83:20 - gonna check my extensions I say my
83:29 - chrome ascent extension is quickly to
83:32 - let you know the name of this for sure
83:36 - yeah it's called scrum for Trello so
83:41 - it's not a Trello thing that you get in
83:44 - Trello it's a chrome add-on which is
83:48 - kind of cool because the Trello add-ons
83:50 - I think you can have one now for free
83:55 - but if you want any more than that you
83:57 - have to pay so it doesn't use up one of
84:00 - your your Trello add-on slows alright so
84:06 - John Hanson says a component that
84:12 - imports multiple components and two
84:19 - components imported array data comes
84:22 - from two sources can't see how to make
84:24 - the array get mapped from a variable so
84:27 - I can reuse the components okay let me
84:29 - read this again all right so I'm gonna
84:33 - read this to myself
84:49 - all right so you have one component
84:52 - that's importing multiple components all
84:54 - right so that's that's fine so in two
85:00 - components imported array data comes
85:03 - from two sources can't see how to make
85:07 - the array get mapped from a variable so
85:10 - I can reuse the components
85:23 - okay so I guess it would be easier if I
85:32 - could see the code so if you do have
85:34 - this on github or something that would
85:36 - be that would be cool but I would check
85:40 - out I know that we're using we're
85:48 - mapping over a lot of data in this this
85:52 - project we're doing it and then the last
85:53 - project we're doing it maybe if you
85:57 - check out some of the the views where
85:59 - we're importing different components and
86:02 - different data I know especially in the
86:05 - last project we we were importing well I
86:09 - guess we we ended up importing it
86:11 - combining it into one one array but I
86:17 - want to check that out and see if it
86:19 - helps if not and you if you can send me
86:23 - a link I oh I check it out and let you
86:27 - know what I think about it maybe I can
86:30 - help but anyway I mean you should be
86:37 - able to use map and go over unless I'm
86:41 - misunderstanding what's going on you
86:43 - should be able to you know have that
86:45 - array you know as a variable and just do
86:51 - dot map something like something like
86:59 - this right so array variable map and
87:08 - then you could just put data and then
87:14 - after that you could have like h1
87:26 - I mean you get at something like this
87:29 - where I mean I guess we could do it more
87:32 - like right so you could map over that
87:42 - data and so this component you would be
87:48 - able to reuse this component as much as
87:50 - you want as long as you have that data
87:52 - available in this parent component so
87:58 - not sure if that's if that's helpful I
88:00 - said I could be misunderstanding what's
88:02 - going on but let me know send me the
88:04 - code if you can
88:14 - okay so John said I just want to import
88:17 - a different array for different views
88:19 - using the same components yet you should
88:26 - be able to where are you importing the
88:32 - arrays from so are you making API calls
88:38 - or do these arrays exist like like how
88:41 - we have them in these data files
88:51 - because I guess that essentially that's
88:53 - kind of what we're doing right so you
88:57 - know so we're importing an array called
88:59 - poster data into posters jas and then
89:03 - we're using the card component we're
89:06 - mapping over the card component and then
89:10 - you know in home DJ s we're importing an
89:13 - array called generic card data and then
89:19 - we're mapping over that data and we're
89:23 - reusing the generic card component there
89:35 - okay
89:42 - mattias what are you doing if you mean
89:46 - the project this is a react project that
89:49 - would create react app and it's
89:52 - basically just a way for people at where
89:55 - I work to submit requests to my
89:59 - department through this react site so it
90:05 - takes file filled input file uploads and
90:09 - it forwards that on to a project
90:10 - management system it does a few other
90:13 - things but that's the main purpose of it
90:15 - if you meant what was I doing at the
90:16 - time you asked that I was explaining my
90:19 - approach my time management system right
90:23 - at that moment Patrick I just saw that
90:30 - you gave J the name scrum for Trello so
90:32 - thanks for that sorry I didn't see that
90:37 - earlier
90:50 - okay so Patrick says that John could
90:54 - pass in a boolean flag to decide which
90:57 - data to grab and pass that in as a prop
91:06 - yeah
91:24 - or Patrick says if you have more than
91:26 - two types you can pass a type prop so
91:30 - that could work I guess each I don't
91:34 - know I really would actually like to see
91:36 - that so I think this is probably the
91:47 - type of thing that if I or someone else
91:49 - in the live chat can see the code you'd
91:51 - probably be able to figure it out
91:54 - a lot more quickly so so anyway if
92:00 - possible I think we can get it sorted
92:01 - out if we could see it but I've come to
92:06 - the end of the live chat so I think I'm
92:13 - gonna wrap things up now thank you so
92:15 - much for for watching and for all your
92:18 - help especially for those of you who
92:21 - submitted pull requests help me out in
92:23 - the live chat tested things really
92:27 - appreciate that I appreciate everybody
92:29 - watching everybody ask questions I love
92:33 - to get questions and it's really cool if
92:37 - I could help you out in some way I will
92:40 - be back tomorrow I think that should be
92:46 - the same time as normal I don't think I
92:48 - have anything conflicting so 2 p.m.
92:50 - Eastern Time and hopefully I can get
92:54 - whatever's going on with that server
92:57 - sorted out so that we can go over some
93:00 - file uploads security with nodejs
93:04 - I think that would be cool to do on a
93:07 - stream but until then thanks for
93:12 - watching and have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody its Jesse and happy Monday I hope everyone had a good weekend I had a nice break from coding this weekend so I don't I don't think I did any coding at all except I help my wife with with some coding so she's doing she just started freaking camp so but other than that I had had a good break my oldest daughter just turned six what she's gonna turn six in a few days but we had her party on on Sunday so I'm all rested up and today I've been working on adding some security to our file uploads so the first thing I was trying to do was just to add a whitelist for file types so it's pretty predictable what gets uploaded I already can see what what everyone is uploaded over the last year I guess so I think it why twist would probably be the best way to go and I could probably add in some more things after that like limit the file size the number of files but when I was trying to do that I did all this research to try to figure out the best way to do it and then I couldn't get the server so we had one version of this site that was running on port 9000 and I couldn't get it to work and so now I'm going back through pool requests to see what has changed since the last time that I had that working so I'll show you what kind of errors I'm getting and see maybe maybe one of you have had a similar area before and can point me in the right direction here hey everyone I just check the live chat how's it going Ike so the the editor is actually Adam so it's the Adam editor from github with the SETI theme alright so let me show you the errors so this is what I'm getting I'll make it a little bigger I'm getting these errors I have there are some things on Stack Overflow and an issue on the create react app github repo that's people are having similar errors so I'm I'm just trying to troubleshoot that see the stream is started right in the middle of me doing the troubleshooting this is what I found so oops Thanks so someone had had a similar issue and after going back and forth a bit trying to figure out what the issue was this fixed it for them so in their package JSON they had their home page listed and I thought hey we did ever homepage changed it at one point so you could see on our package JSON we actually we have this as the home page and that was to get github pages working so I thought okay maybe it's that so I took out the home page and that didn't fix it I tried adding the home page in here like like it's been done here and that didn't work so now my my next my next idea is have a basically I just want to see what all has changed can I just take out some things and test it so I'm looking back into I guess this was the commit let me bring this over this is the commit where we added github pages support and so the only file changed basically is a package.json so it it shouldn't make a difference that we have these dependencies that all the only thing that change that would actually make any difference at all would be this home page thing and if we change yet this should be fine yeah hmm yeah so I'm kind of at a point where I guess I need to do some more research some I'm a little bit stuck here so unless someone has some ideas I probably just switch back to the main branch so I luckily wood started doing this on another branch because I well for number one it's good practice to do new things on another branch but I suspected that I might have something like this happened where I get stuck and so I'm just going to switch back to the master branch and work on some other stuff because for the live stream me reading through github issues is not going to be very exciting not not that my streams are supposed to be exciting or arcs I think that but it's definitely don't want to watch me read so the movies over in my other screen and work on them later and let's pull over this so you can see it's on the branch file type check and I should probably push that to github in case anyone wants to look at it so okay that's good that's what should be changed so I'm just committing this I'm adding the files and I'm committing it to our git repo and I'm at a commit message basically all I did was install a package called file type that reads a stream of your file coming in and it reached enough of it to give you the the file type and that was about as far as I got and I set up in the server JS file just a console log the file type just a test to make sure it was working and at that point that's when I realized that I needed to fix whatever was going on with with the server not being able to run okay so let's go there we go so now that's on github you can check out the little bit that I did do if you like and now we're back on the master branch so we should be able to just continue on and do some other things and then come back to that later on after I do similar research I'm gonna bring over my Pomodoro timer and okay cool so Patrick is testing this so thanks Patrick I I appreciate it all right so I'm going to start my timer and do some stuff I'm going to start the timer we'll check my Trello board and see what we can do okay so actually I think that's it guys spent for Pomodoro sessions on this today already alright so let's see what we need but okay let's do this because this will let me this would be a good way to introduce some of the changes from last pull request as well so Matt submitted a pull request with some good stuff in it it was pull request 52 if you want to check out everything to change some of the things that changed include using so setting state outside of the constructor we had a big kind of discussion and talking about what will the best practices were for that and so basically the conclusion is that it's okay to do that it's syntactic sugar you need you definitely need Babel which if you're writing stuff with reactive you're running that anyway so you just need to be able to have so this is we're talking about just setting state like this at least initially right you're we're still going to use set state you know anywhere down here you know which is what you should do but at least initially instead of doing the constructor we can do it like this so almost everywhere this is in change back to using this method which is you know a bit shorter a little bit cleaner something I can't remember all the other changes as well but that was one of the main changes was to change these back and also the other one of the other big changes and the one that we're going to work on right now on kind of improving even more is this this card so what Matt had done so what I had done previously was I wrapped this card in the paper component and I gave it a Z depth so in material UI you give you can give an item a paper component depth what I mean by depth in case you're not familiar with how this works in material design is let me pull this over something like this okay so on the posters page you can see each one of these cards has you know an apparent depth because of the shadow and then when I hover over it the depth changes or it changes apparently it seems as if the hovered card is closer than these other cars so that's what I mean by Z depth as in like the Z coordinate for talking like X Y Z so this is how you set the depth on the paper component so you can't do Z depth on card that's why I wrapped it in paper so I took away the black shadow from the card so I wouldn't have double shadows wrapped it in the paper component set the Z depth and I was checking for when the the mouse was going in and out and I was changing the state so the state in of death and actually this isn't the new stuff actually this isn't bad Elvises right now because this will show you what we were doing and now it's changed so you can see I was just changing it from depth 1 to depth 2 but there were some some weird stuff going on it wasn't exactly the what I wanted so I'm not sure why they didn't update sometimes when I pull things and it doesn't auto update and Adam I have to close it and open it again so let's try that hmm okay it looks like it looks like Matt didn't remove these possibly we you know maybe he wasn't sure if I wanted to keep these to go back to it so he did remove the onmouseover and onmouseout from the actual component so it used to be on this paper component here okay so that's nice it is kind of nice though that we can see his side by side so instead of doing this Matt made a a clasp and what did he put this I think he put it on in the poster CSS file of the sass file yeah okay so he just uses CSS hover and he added that on on to this div so he wrapped everything in another div gave it a height of 100 percent and then is adding this this class name of yes it fix hey you see sorry I'm just checking this alliant yeah the fixed site just does the 100% height so basically what I want to do now is I think we can remove this paper element we can probably remove this div and just apply the styles directly to the card we may need to keep one Dev actually but we for sure we can remove the paper so I'm gonna go ahead and remove the paper now because we will not need that so let's remove that and we can get rid of paper here and now we can check this out just to verify I thought we could remove a paper telling you know I know what's happening okay so that the paper was where we were getting the initial state from which is fine we don't need that because we could just take this off of the card we take that off the card and the card we need to add the we can add fixed side yeah okay so that gives us pretty much the same effect but it's not it's not exactly what I want so let me pull in so hopefully you'll be able to see the comparison so this is on materialized and this is how their effect works and we'll compare that to what's going on here so there's definitely a difference there's a difference in the shadow and and it seems in the transition it seems like the transition is just slightly slower here the shadow is longer not quite as dark this one is shorter and more dark so I want to switch this to use the shadow you know more like this on hover and so as far as I know materialised doesn't have just a class a hover class or I'm sorry material UI doesn't have just a hover class it's possible that I missed it but in looking through the documentation for cards there wasn't an option just to make the card hover Abul so in materialise there is so I'm just gonna import the styles from materialized and apply them to these cars okay alright so I just checked the live chat quickly and have some more info about the air ok thanks so matt matt has some input as well so patrick it was working on port 3000 it was port 9000 that I couldn't get it just came up with a blank page and had some errors all right so let's just change change the hover a bit and possibly see if we can even get rid of this this other div and just slim things down just a bit so what I was thinking initially was I could just get rid of this and set the styles set the styles for the box shadow it's a nun like I had before the problem is I'd have to use I'd either have to do it in line in that case anything I do here one wouldn't work it would get canceled out by this or I could do here and then put important which I'm gonna try to do but I vaguely remember trying this before and if you're using important the hover style just got automatically applied it was kind of odd I'm gonna try it again but maybe I'm remembering wrong and it'll work but that's the plan so basically we're going to use this hub herbal class but we're going to bring in the base card shadow from materialize and also the transition so basically everything that they use in materialize for their card hover we're going to bring that in as well and we're just going to try to override what's going on here so I think I have the the code from material as yep since we've been borrowing so heavily from materialize I just leave their repo open okay just not in this one just get back to components I don't remember which one I was on before their evils okay we'll try out cards okay zdepth which ice I figured zdepth would be in variables but maybe it has its own no it doesn't this will try again maybe I know it's not there it's probably in global there we go okay so we want to grab this I guess I'll just grab the whole thing like since we're using sass anyway we'll put it in that format okay and the initial card zyne up for one okay okay and I don't think I don't think we need this extend we'll see we'll leave it in for now Susie that's one and all right so we need to put in let's try it we'll try taking this out first like I said I hopefully we can make it work like that and then it would just make the component a bit smaller let's see where's my clothes I'm not sure what classes I'm already passing in hmm I guess I'm not I don't think I'm even using this anywhere to have the classes here oh wow can you check I'm gonna check my time okay we have five minutes so five minutes I'm gonna go to the to the live chat and catch up on everything that's going on so if here so if you ask me questions or anything I'm not I'm not ignoring you at least forever okay well let me check just to make sure okay so good so far let's let's give this these for testing let's just call this card oops and hopefully my doing let's give it a see dad one and actually classes however so let's go actually how do I add what's the best way to add in classes that I'm hardcoding but then also be able to put in some classes as well so obviously I need this classes but then I want to add in these can I I don't think I can do that we'll just we'll see find out all right I didn't do what I wanted it to do but let's see what classes end up on here undefined card see there's one okay okay so Matson use template literal syntax okay cool I like template little syntax anyway yeah oops so I know we've gone over template literal syntax a bunch of times but in case you didn't see any of that or you know you're not familiar with it let's let me just explain it since it is it's not like oldschool JavaScript I guess so this is not es5 this is es6 stuff so when we use backticks instead of double quotes of single quotes this is a string that you can do JavaScript inside of so if you want to do JavaScript you just put dollar sign curly bracket and then anything inside these brackets is treated as JavaScript so we this classes is not a string it's a variable so it'll pool in whatever the value of classes is and then everything else is to string other cool things we can do with there like like this works you can have spaces and stuff in between so really cool very useful way better than having to put a bunch of plus signs and lots of quotes so anyway thanks Matt so this should say yeah so now this is spaced out although it does say undefined and I don't want it to say undefined so what am I doing wrong oh I never changed that wait no I don't need to change that what am I thinking yeah so I'm pulling in should be pulling in classes oh well my timers up so let me take five minutes and go through the live chat not a whole lot in the live chat yet so shouldn't take too long may not even use up the whole five minutes so you have air drifters hi from San Diego awesome welcome and thanks for joining in in the live chat okay so update on the port 9000 err so Patrick was able to recreate that error yes it's a cryptic error yeah the error just doesn't it's not super helpful okay well at least I guess I feel better that you can duplicate the air and it's not just something on my machine Sebastian Xavier says I think coding is cool I just started learning HTML and a little bit of JavaScript I took a weeklong class too that's awesome and welcome to coding yeah so hopefully you're you're able to follow at least some of what we're doing so I know now if you just you know you're doing a little bit of JavaScript you may not know figure out you know everything that's going on here but little things like template literal syntax that'll be kind of a cool some cool syntax that will save you some time that you might not get in maybe like beginning JavaScript courses okay so Matt's given some advice as well on this okay so did I have so I guess I was before classy anyway cool okay it's a Sebastian's a versus I know the basics yeah so anyway so hopefully it's you can you can follow along with some of it depending on what I'm doing for you know for one of these it may be more beginner friendly you know we just do we would own everything we need to do to build you know a whole site so some of them will be really basic and some streams will be a little bit more advanced all right so I am through with everything in the live chat for now early which that's crazy normally I always go over and so I am going to set my reset my timer to twenty five minutes so I'm gonna do at least one more twenty five minute session and then we'll see how much is in the live chat I don't think I'm gonna do a third one we'll see I do want to make sure that I get out of here and enough time to take my son to his karate class so may wrap things up a bit earlier we'll still definitely have an hourlong stream today though all right so on my other screen I'm gonna bring up I'm gonna bring up what that generic card component was since I've changed it and I don't I don't want to undo everything just to see what I would I change so because I think I changed some stuff that I shouldn't and that's why I'm having some problems okay so I actually did have hmm so initially I think it was like this and that's where I was pulling it in so I never really needed to change these well I guess I guess it didn't really matter so but originally on the outermost div this is what was being pulled in I always did have classes here to just pass down the classes right to the card component but this makes sense to do it like this so let's see all right cool so now we are getting hoverball which is what we want cards you have okay great so now let's make this work why isn't this working what did I do alright so I'm gonna try this with this is gonna look terrible the first so I'm just gonna confirm that this is working yet okay I was great know how let's see if this works yep all right great so whatever I was worried about at the beginning I don't know what I was thinking but this definitely does work great all right so now we can see it's definitely a different a different effect okay so I I wanted to switch it up to this for for a few reasons mainly because this is consistent with what I've been doing with all my other sites so while I do want to use material UI for react sites going forward maybe probably I'll use the newest version for the next site I do but I I do want the styles to match because you know we have some sites that it's going to be a while before they get redone so I do want to keep it consistent so in little details like this it's not really a big deal especially since there's not built in hover mechanism I think it's okay to go with materialise and the way they do it all right but I think that's it it looks more smooth I kind of like how the shadows a bit more spread out I'm not so I don't know it just seemed abrupt I guess that it was so dark underneath here so anyway that that works so I'd say that that was bestcase scenario here so you know over here we added in a bit more CSS but the component itself we're able to get rid of four lines in this component so it's not bad also we can remove this because we're no longer we no longer need to use that because that was here so that's five lines and we got rid of our import for paper it's a sick lines so we remove six lines that's cool so six lines from that component and we've imported this now what I'd like to do is have this in a different file right because I'm not just going to use this for posters so I think we should actually all of this should be should be used so I think I'm just gonna take all of this and I'm gonna put it in something that gets loaded up a bit higher so maybe you're in our app yeah so these are more I guess like utility classes so like this this video line you know so I'm gonna move that up here I think it makes more sense to be here since cards are so common in material design and we use cards on a lot of different pages oops okay so for right now at least you don't have anything in posters so let's see I I don't know that I will add anything any special styles and posters so I may just get rid of this file completely let's get rid of these and then let's get rid of it oops now I wasn't importing it there I was importing it in posters actually now that I think about it since some of what we're doing applies to the flight of cards I guess it doesn't apply to just cards so we could add potentially we can add hover ball as a class to anything and make it horrible so I'm for a second I thought about making some a SAS file for this generic card component and moving the styles into that but now I'm I'm gonna leave it where it is I don't I can't think of anything right now that I would use hover go on but at least in materialize it is separate and you can use it on more than just cards so I'll leave it as is for now and that'll keep us from making more more files so all right so now all told we've removed seven lines of code between the two of these components we've removed two files we have added a bit on to our app dot s CSS file so let's say not bad I'm happy with that result and that took while way less than anticipated so it's great so what was that I'm gonna say 1.5 so I guess not way less I forgotten I'd already done one Pomodoro psycho on this before okay but still under the amount of time that I expected so while we're on this generic card we may as well go to the home page and add that to some of the home cards so these two kind of go together so we'll work on both of these I'm gonna move this over here until I get some more ideas about it mmm not I'm not gonna try to add the icons right now I'm still not exactly sure how I want to do that okay so let's go to the home page I'm gonna move this over here and do this okay so here's our our home view and here's where we're bringing in our generic cards and we want to instead of doing it like this we want to do it more like this so we want to bring in hover Balazs well actually in link writes have horrible and link and actually let me show you the home page in case you haven't seen it before so here's our home page right now so you see we don't have hover over any of these I'm clicking on all of them and they're not linked ship but they all need to link to something so some of them are actually going to go they're just going to be a file download so the PowerPoint will be the brand manual will be but then these four will link to other places other views within this site and and this is at is not the final version of this page I realized it's very plain looking I guess so we need to go to where the data is so this is kind of really nice how this is set up is because this is all pulling in data and then everything's set up kind of as props to do different things in this component converting these cards over is going to be really easy we just need to change things in the way the data is set up and pulled in which is really cool that was our goal from the beginning with this generic card component was something that could do anything you would want a card to do I mean within reason just by passing in different props alright so let me see let's find our data and we want to pull our poster data up here and links data yep this is it okay so we just need to add huh verbal true.really to everything so hmm actually these already say linked to so that's all right I suppose if we just changed this to link that we should be fine oh you know what I'm sorry these are the side nav side nav links so sorry if you hear that noise it's my phone going off I don't recognize the number I'm not going to answer it but it's sound vibrated there we go that's what we want okay yeah so let's pull in huh verbal and also like audible both of these in now just to get him in there I guess so I'm gonna put them on the bottom okay let's let's pull up that links data again because we can use a lot of this request shares story this isn't just posters this will be logos logos posters what did I name that page those posters I think that's what I had it as manual and then the other two I'll just leave like this for now I'm not sure where those files are actually gonna be so when I find that out I can just put the data in whoops okay hmm okay what am I not bringing in oh I forgot to actually pass those props okay so car title there we go that works great let's see I do want to check alright great so that is did we never make this view I guess we didn't I thought I had me put in the content for all the views but I guess I missed one so I'll make that one yeah this one's really easy it's just two cards okay actually kind of don't like that you have to click this and then click another spot to go in there it would it would be nicer if maybe I just had logos posters and you could click to go under one of the other and then it wouldn't match the rest of the cards unless I had other things down here I'm not sure let me know what you think it's one extra click and I guess I do get the chance to put more information about the logos and the posters on the second page the only reason I combined them was because I just I didn't want one extra hanging down here but I guess we do have we have the tutorial if I can think of one more thing to put here the glossary I guess then we could have nine that might work let me know what you think about that would it be too much instead of six to have nine of them split out logos and posters have the tutorial visible right away and have the glossary visible yeah that might work and before when I had these large icons that would have been too much but now it will definitely fit and I'll make the page look a bit less dull okay all right see about three and a half minutes left for this Pomodoro session since we finished that so this was I guess the the smallest I can put in is a half so I'll put in a half for both of these but really it took less than a half of a session if you're not familiar with Pomodoro sessions and things this is just a way of breaking up your time of working and estimating what you do so you take a fiveminute break every 25 minutes after four sessions a tenminute break there may be other ways to do that that's just the way that I learned and the the estimation comes in where you try to estimate beforehand how many Pomodoro sessions it will take to do something and then after you do it you put how many it actually did take then you can get a good idea of whether you know how long projects will take after you do it for a while you get pretty good at estimating so right now I'm you know these numbers are pretty close when I first started doing it my numbers would be very different I usually would overestimate now I'm a lot better at that and that's really good it's good for time management personally but it's also good if you're freelancing to give have an accurate idea of how long projects will take so that you can figure out pricing so very very helpful it's been very helpful for me to keep me on track I've been doing this system for over a year now alright oops and I meant to look at another thing I don't know I get anything else done in three minutes it's probably two and a half by now oops actually we can clean this up a bit so Matt already did this so I'm gonna just put that and done since I have no idea how long it took Matt and I am NOT I really I don't want to require contributors to check their time as well anything done in a pull request I'm just gonna pull over and put nothing there so that way I'll know if I see something like this immediately they all know I didn't do this this was from full request okay not bad getting through a lot of to do's I know this list isn't complete I'm sure there'll be other things I'll see to add to this but not bad we cut this about in half from what it was earlier in the day okay let me so it's just regular get add get commit just like we did earlier so as soon as that finishes I'm going to push this to github so that you all have access to everything that we just did make sure there was one other thing that I think we could take out now so I'm pretty sure pretty sure we're not using horrible anymore yeah we're I think we're not using hub herbal and since we're not using all this I'll probably remove all this let's just remove this right now so I don't forget so you don't need hover bowl and we don't need it was it in posters so we don't need it here and we don't need any of this and since we don't need that we don't need debounce or we're getting rid of you in more lines it's just great we don't need this oops actually do we need any of this now I don't think so I'm scared of this I just saw Blake said his fan is loud I actually don't have my fan on right now maybe my computer is lovin yeah for some reason I didn't notice it cuz I had music playing in my headphones but yeah my computer is a bit louder than normal it's normally pretty quiet let's see I think that's all we can remove but that's pretty good and we can also that's all I'm gonna do right now I'm thinking can we change this into functional component probably all right so Oh and I just changed this hold on so let me go to the live chat and see what's going on if you aren't familiar with how this stream goes the end of the stream is saved for question and answers so we have a little intro some coding and then question answer Wow I messed something up let's and then the that we do some code and then the last part is question answer so if you don't want to stick around for the question and answer session then thanks for watching and I'll be back tomorrow hopefully you can join in again otherwise please put your questions in the live chat now and I'll just go straight from the top of the live chat and go through all the questions try to answer as many as I can if you can't stick around to hear your question answered you can always catch the recording of this that's available on free code camp or you could just ask me some other way like on Twitter or any social media network where you can find me interrupted depth of thumb okay I must not have gotten rid of everything actually yeah we did have depth we were using the zdepth in here what we hmm all right but I think we can get rid of this safely without without needing it so let's let's see okay so that those still work great so hopefully if anyone notices any bugs with that because of how much was changed I mean I certainly didn't test it thoroughly but everything should work and all right so let's see what it says now so while that's running I'm gonna try to find some questions Chris Chung says can I do this on a Chromebook you certainly could do this on a Chromebook you would have to use some type of cloud editor like cloud nine I can't remember I've used some other ones before but I can't remember the name so if you check out I think the website c9 dot IO that would work basically you just need an environment where you can run well you can run all the stuff that you need to run so you need to be able to bring in NPM packages and things like that so cloud 9 can do that and there are alternatives so I I have developed on a Chromebook before and it works basically in the same way as long as you only have a good cloud development environment I say it says can you get a job with just knowing frontend yeah yeah for sure so I mean I'm a frontend developer right now I do know a little bit more than frontend I do have to do some backend stuff and DevOps stuff from time to time because we don't have other people to do that here but there are plenty of jobs for frontend developers if you check out Stack Overflow jobs you'll see a lot or really any any job get github as their own job thing but I see it son of frontend jobs on Stack Overflow pretty much every time I'm on there it shows me frontend jobs Patrick I see you told me not to forget the commas I knew someone had you have seen that in the live chat wants us Andrea says great when I'm watching this video I can study coding and learn English at the same time well that's that's awesome I had never thought that someone could learn English while watching this but that's cool glad I can help in any way Rohan says late yet again well at least you made it before it was over this time yang John says hi hey how's it going thanks for watching John Henson says Jessie yes add more to that dole page yeah for sure okay Blake sorry Blake Blake had said that my fan was loud and I commented on a few minutes ago thinking that he meant my my office fan which I did I was running you know when it got really hot in here earlier in the summer but he actually did meet my computer fan so sorry about that and actually quieted down huh I can't hear it at all so I don't know what was going on I mean you all saw what I was going it's not like I had anything open or closed it but whatever occasionally my computer has just been like the fan just kicks into high gear and it's just super loud for a few minutes and then it's okay Blake says c9i Oh does require credit card but it's refundable and it's either zero a $1 charge said he did it the other day and it was not a problem at all yeah that's true I always forget that when I started cloud 9 they didn't require a credit card but then they changed their policy afterwards and you do need a credit card to sign up even if you're just going there plan they just wanted I did continent get I like kind of I kind of think cloud9 got bought out by somebody and then the policy switch but I can't remember exactly what would happen with that J Evans asked hey Jesse what was your time management solution again okay yeah I'll go over this time management solution so basically it's it's a Pomodoro Technique and so I have this Pomodoro timer so it's a 25minute session fiveminute breaks every four sessions I take a long break of ten minutes okay so that's the time this is just tomato timer calm that's tomato timer calm there's so many Pomodoro timers out there and in fact I think I think it's one of the lessons in free code camp to make your own Pomodoro timer so I'm sure there are thousands it probably tens of thousands of Pomodoro timers available out there but that use that for my timer and then I have this is just Trello and it's a free project management solution and I set things up like like this it doesn't come set up like this automatically so but I so I create these these cards these columns of to do ready for development in progress testing done and wish list wishlist is just stuff that I'd like to have that isn't necessary to complete the project but if I get time I'll put them in the other ones are pretty selfexplanatory so when I go to create a new task I try to break the tasks down as small as possible and I create the task and then I add a number and that number is how many Pomodoro sessions so how many 25minute sessions I think it will take me to complete this now that there are other ways of doing this some people I've I've heard some people do like complexity so the number doesn't represent time it represents complexity so I'm not to that point yet maybe I'll switch over to something like that but for now this this works for me now after I complete this I would actually put how many points it took so let's say it only took me three I have three in there so now these two numbers get compared so if I were to move this over here you can see it tells me you know five was what I estimated and three is what it really was and you can see it just adds that up on the top so I can see very quickly since it's still in progress this means I'm not done so if I look at this I would say okay I need about three more sessions to go until I'm done with this column I can you know I can look in here and say okay five more sessions I'm done with my entire project assuming that I already had laid out all the two dues and then at the end I can look and say it took me this many sessions to complete or this many sessions to complete so it was either I was ahead of schedule either overestimate or underestimated but I can tell all of that and on my next project I can go back in and check and say okay well this took me this long last time so I would have a good idea how long it's going to take me the next time so that's how I do it it's um it's been pretty useful you definitely have to be consistent with it for it to be useful but I found that the the five minute breaks are really nice because sometimes it's easy like if you have these for me when I have a problem I'm working on like a bug or something and I can't get it to work I just get so into it you all get buried and documentation and trying to search through things and it's easy for me to waste you know hours trying to look into this but if I take that five minute break it just forces me to take a step back and say look back at my Trello Trello board mark another Pomodoro session and then I can see the big picture again and at that little bit of time that few minutes allows me to just think okay is this superimportant can I just switch to something else and get something done and then come back to that when I have a better idea of of what I want to do and sometimes that's that's the best thing to do at the time I switch it up I get some stuff done I feel a little bit accomplished and then later on some idea comes to me that I can try so instead of just spinning my wheels or not getting anything done I'm way more productive so it doesn't always work out like that but it's happened enough that you know this has definitely been worth it for me and very useful so anyway hopefully that was a decent enough explanation there is a I learned this in a course on Pluralsight so I had like a free threemonth subscription to Pluralsight at one time and there was a course on I think the course was called agile for one so it was talking about agile technique but in in that course it was talking about the Pomodoro Technique and Kanban boards which this is actually I not Pomodoro this is Kanban so anyway it was combining several different techniques and trying to adapt it so that someone who's not on a team could work in a way that's closer to how agile teams work I mean you can't replicate it with one person but it it definitely helped me like I said I've been using it for over a year now and definitely liked it a little bit more work to set up at the beginning but it's nice I let's see let me get there's a few more comments here almost to the bottom oh sorry Jay had a followup question about the number system for Trello that yes so that's actually a chrome addon called scrum for Trello yeah I'm pretty sure that's the name of it let me check I'm gonna check my extensions I say my chrome ascent extension is quickly to let you know the name of this for sure yeah it's called scrum for Trello so it's not a Trello thing that you get in Trello it's a chrome addon which is kind of cool because the Trello addons I think you can have one now for free but if you want any more than that you have to pay so it doesn't use up one of your your Trello addon slows alright so John Hanson says a component that imports multiple components and two components imported array data comes from two sources can't see how to make the array get mapped from a variable so I can reuse the components okay let me read this again all right so I'm gonna read this to myself all right so you have one component that's importing multiple components all right so that's that's fine so in two components imported array data comes from two sources can't see how to make the array get mapped from a variable so I can reuse the components okay so I guess it would be easier if I could see the code so if you do have this on github or something that would be that would be cool but I would check out I know that we're using we're mapping over a lot of data in this this project we're doing it and then the last project we're doing it maybe if you check out some of the the views where we're importing different components and different data I know especially in the last project we we were importing well I guess we we ended up importing it combining it into one one array but I want to check that out and see if it helps if not and you if you can send me a link I oh I check it out and let you know what I think about it maybe I can help but anyway I mean you should be able to use map and go over unless I'm misunderstanding what's going on you should be able to you know have that array you know as a variable and just do dot map something like something like this right so array variable map and then you could just put data and then after that you could have like h1 I mean you get at something like this where I mean I guess we could do it more like right so you could map over that data and so this component you would be able to reuse this component as much as you want as long as you have that data available in this parent component so not sure if that's if that's helpful I said I could be misunderstanding what's going on but let me know send me the code if you can okay so John said I just want to import a different array for different views using the same components yet you should be able to where are you importing the arrays from so are you making API calls or do these arrays exist like like how we have them in these data files because I guess that essentially that's kind of what we're doing right so you know so we're importing an array called poster data into posters jas and then we're using the card component we're mapping over the card component and then you know in home DJ s we're importing an array called generic card data and then we're mapping over that data and we're reusing the generic card component there okay mattias what are you doing if you mean the project this is a react project that would create react app and it's basically just a way for people at where I work to submit requests to my department through this react site so it takes file filled input file uploads and it forwards that on to a project management system it does a few other things but that's the main purpose of it if you meant what was I doing at the time you asked that I was explaining my approach my time management system right at that moment Patrick I just saw that you gave J the name scrum for Trello so thanks for that sorry I didn't see that earlier okay so Patrick says that John could pass in a boolean flag to decide which data to grab and pass that in as a prop yeah or Patrick says if you have more than two types you can pass a type prop so that could work I guess each I don't know I really would actually like to see that so I think this is probably the type of thing that if I or someone else in the live chat can see the code you'd probably be able to figure it out a lot more quickly so so anyway if possible I think we can get it sorted out if we could see it but I've come to the end of the live chat so I think I'm gonna wrap things up now thank you so much for for watching and for all your help especially for those of you who submitted pull requests help me out in the live chat tested things really appreciate that I appreciate everybody watching everybody ask questions I love to get questions and it's really cool if I could help you out in some way I will be back tomorrow I think that should be the same time as normal I don't think I have anything conflicting so 2 p.m. Eastern Time and hopefully I can get whatever's going on with that server sorted out so that we can go over some file uploads security with nodejs I think that would be cool to do on a stream but until then thanks for watching and have a great day
