00:08 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:11 - with Jesse sorry about that I'm two
00:14 - minutes late this is two days in a row
00:16 - I'm late I was having some technical
00:19 - difficulties so the stream the stream
00:22 - wouldn't start it was entirely my fault
00:26 - though is user error so also I was
00:30 - trying to finish off the done up before
00:32 - the stream started I almost did it
00:34 - there's like maybe two bites left so
00:38 - today is probably going to be a really
00:41 - short stream less than an hour there's a
00:46 - non mandatory event going on at 3:00 I
00:52 - still haven't decided in entirely
00:54 - whether or not I'm gonna go I probably
00:57 - should go but to be honest I felt like
01:02 - I'm gonna have a panic attack for the
01:04 - last hour I'm not exactly sure why I
01:06 - just I think I just have a lot of stuff
01:08 - going on right now
01:09 - and time's running out so streaking me
01:12 - out a little bit so I'd rather have a
01:15 - panic attack in my office and then have
01:17 - a panic attack in front of the entire
01:20 - university so we'll see
01:23 - maybe I'll go maybe I won't I'm thinking
01:26 - thy screaming will help me take my mind
01:29 - off of everything and feel better so I
01:33 - haven't had a panic attack in a really
01:36 - long time so I don't I don't think it'll
01:39 - happen
01:40 - we'll see enough about my mental health
01:45 - let's get started I've chosen today to
01:48 - work on some easy stuff you know just
01:52 - some basic UI things I I had some other
01:57 - ideas I wanted to get started on the
01:58 - authentication but I don't think I have
02:00 - enough information yet to really get
02:04 - started I've been waiting back to hear
02:07 - back from someone in the IT department
02:16 - let's see I just got an email back from
02:19 - some I'm looking at it right now so okay
02:28 - I'm gonna have to review that a little
02:30 - bit a little bit better after the stream
02:34 - but all right so let's let's get started
02:44 - let's let's do some work on this and
02:46 - I've gotten a lot of pool requests so I
02:50 - think what I'll do is I'd like to get
02:53 - just get started and get to work and
02:55 - then maybe we'll see if we have some
02:58 - time we can review the pool request
02:59 - later on in the stream I really
03:02 - appreciate everybody submitting requests
03:04 - I had some some new people who've never
03:07 - submitted pool requests before to the
03:08 - projects and that's awesome so thanks
03:11 - and I'm gonna keep putting up issues so
03:14 - I've already got up more issues I think
03:18 - maybe I think like seven new issues
03:21 - maybe maybe less than seven and you all
03:26 - are awesome it's it's like as soon as I
03:28 - post the issues someone's saying hey
03:30 - I'll I'll take that one so that's great
03:37 - so let me show you first what we're
03:41 - gonna work on and then we'll do it and
03:44 - I'll start my timer so if you're new to
03:50 - the show the timer is to kind of break
03:53 - things up a little bit so we'll do 25
03:55 - minutes of coding and then we'll take a
03:56 - five-minute break and I'll go to the
03:59 - live chat and answer any questions that
04:00 - you all have and then we'll go back and
04:03 - forth like that and and then at the end
04:06 - of the stream if there are any questions
04:08 - that I couldn't get to which usually
04:09 - happens then I'll get to all the
04:11 - questions so if you have asked something
04:13 - and I'm not getting to it right away
04:14 - just be patient and I will get to it
04:16 - before I am the stream okay so this is
04:20 - what I want to work on so I this
04:24 - particular page
04:25 - really obvious that I need some work
04:27 - with UI so one of the recent changes is
04:31 - this is now a link which obviously has
04:34 - changed the style so we want to change
04:36 - this obviously I don't want it to be
04:38 - this color I don't want the underline
04:40 - underneath actually I don't even want it
04:45 - to be that font that's kind of odd yeah
04:49 - so a lot has to change so font font has
04:52 - to change across the board in font size
04:55 - a lot of things positioning has to
04:58 - change in this particular case there's
05:01 - no image uploaded so I don't even want
05:03 - there to be an image here I'm also
05:06 - considering adding some margins in I
05:09 - don't know it's not obvious in this post
05:12 - but if we can find another post let's
05:15 - find one with some some more text
05:17 - content you know in this case that it
05:23 - doesn't really look great to have you
05:27 - know have this text all the way across
05:29 - like that so I think we have two options
05:32 - the first option which will probably try
05:34 - out is if we make this font larger it
05:40 - may not look quite as bad because there
05:42 - won't be so many characters across one
05:44 - line or potentially we could add some
05:49 - margins and on the sides and then there
05:54 - won't be so many characters on one line
05:57 - the solution is probably going to end up
05:59 - being a mix of both we'll see so those
06:03 - are my main the main things that I'd
06:07 - like to change I do want to show you how
06:10 - I displayed single posts on the current
06:15 - version of this so let's see I just
06:22 - noticed Sebastian's question at the
06:24 - bottom a live chat here asking why do
06:26 - you want that as a link you are already
06:28 - in the post yes so I actually didn't
06:32 - request that to be a link it was just
06:34 - added in on the pool request that made
06:37 - so what I wanted was this
06:39 - to be a link these titles and then that
06:42 - was just added in I left it in there for
06:45 - now because it's not for right now it's
06:51 - not hurting anything I know I have seen
06:55 - it before particularly with some
06:57 - WordPress sites that it does act like
06:59 - that that the title was always a link no
07:01 - matter what I was going to give it
07:06 - I just merge this pull request a little
07:07 - a little while ago today so I was going
07:10 - to give it some time to think if there
07:12 - would be a good use case for that link
07:14 - before I take it out if I can't think of
07:16 - anything within the next day or two I
07:18 - probably will take it out but for now I
07:21 - need to style that title anyway even
07:24 - before it was a link I wanted to restyle
07:25 - it so it's not really going to be that
07:27 - big of a deal for now so if anybody can
07:33 - think of a use case where we would
07:35 - actually want that to be a link let me
07:40 - know I'm having trouble thinking of it
07:43 - so otherwise I will I will take that out
07:46 - but in that case I liked what was done
07:49 - in the pull request it met all the
07:51 - requirements for that issue so I wanted
07:53 - to go ahead and merge it anyway even
07:56 - though it had that as well in there so
07:58 - so that's that's why so let's see oh I
08:07 - see several reviewers saying that today
08:11 - is Diwali hopefully I'm pronouncing that
08:16 - right so I'm not I'm actually not
08:18 - familiar with Diwali so harsh it says
08:21 - it's like Christmas here so I don't know
08:26 - what the appropriate greeting is so I'll
08:28 - just say you know okay it's happy do all
08:31 - right so happy Diwali to everyone and so
08:38 - for those of you that celebrate that I
08:41 - hope you have a great time okay it's a
08:45 - festival in India cool so I'm just I'm
08:51 - just gonna
08:52 - wish you all a happy time there so I
08:54 - don't really know that much about it so
08:56 - I don't want to be offensive or say
08:59 - something silly about it I limit my
09:01 - comments to that so there's not really a
09:05 - big Indian population where I live so
09:08 - I'm not I'm not that familiar with with
09:11 - Indian customs so so sorry for my
09:17 - ignorance in that area
09:21 - let's see but I know I I do have quite a
09:25 - few viewers from India so so I hope
09:29 - everyone has a good time
09:31 - hey it's a festival of lights cool that
09:34 - sounds cool lots of lights and
09:38 - firecrackers cool that sounds pretty
09:41 - awesome alright maybe I'll have to look
09:45 - up something after the stream about it
09:49 - let's see I guess I checked they're not
09:52 - need to figure out what I was doing ok
09:56 - yeah so we basically gone over oh I know
09:59 - what I was gonna show you sorry I was
10:01 - going to show you how how I'm doing this
10:03 - now with the current bulletin but V aam
10:15 - says please say my name so the young
10:20 - child re I'm really sorry if I'm
10:24 - mispronouncing that I'm sure I am but vo
10:28 - um
10:28 - there you go I said your name thanks for
10:31 - watching thanks for being in the live
10:32 - Shack and I'll see this is I'm on Chrome
10:36 - Canary in this window and I'm not signed
10:39 - in so let me let me go to my other
10:40 - browser window inside since I'm already
10:44 - signed in there this is just regular
10:48 - Chrome
10:52 - there we go alright so this is how I'm
10:57 - displaying things here it's actually in
11:00 - a modal the URL does change
11:05 - so each one of these has its own URL but
11:10 - it's displayed as a modal so I don't
11:12 - exactly have the same issues since it's
11:15 - not an entirely different page the
11:18 - reason I did this in a modal is because
11:20 - I wanted to allow users to keep their
11:24 - place you know we have an infinite
11:26 - scroll implemented so if users are
11:29 - scrolling for a really long time I
11:31 - didn't want their place to get lost so
11:33 - that's why I ended up doing it like this
11:36 - so I think that's still important if
11:40 - there's a way to let a user keep their
11:45 - place so that when they go back so for
11:49 - instance here right we've we've gone to
11:53 - another page if we could go back and
11:57 - have them keep their place I'm okay with
12:01 - with having it on its separate separate
12:04 - page that's oh that was actually my
12:05 - first choice for the original version of
12:07 - the bulletin but like I said I changed
12:09 - it for that reason so they could keep
12:11 - their place so let's see how I should
12:18 - keep saying PR 39 all right I haven't
12:22 - checked if you submitted a PR within the
12:24 - last hour I haven't looked at it yet so
12:30 - I guess I could take a look at PR 39
12:35 - right now and see what's in
12:48 - let me see what your 13 item back
12:51 - in-house okay you know what hard [ __ ] I
12:54 - did see this one I didn't get to go
12:56 - through everything with it but I can see
12:59 - so I did see that that will probably be
13:03 - merged in at some point probably
13:05 - tomorrow so I'll get that merged in
13:13 - Sunni let me actually let's do it like
13:16 - this
13:17 - we could probably test this out so I'm
13:19 - gonna scroll all the way down I'm gonna
13:21 - click this and then I'm gonna click back
13:23 - great we're still in the same spot
13:25 - awesome so we're good to go with this
13:27 - for whatever reason the way I built it
13:30 - the other one it wasn't keeping a user's
13:34 - place so I don't know I don't know what
13:39 - was going on that's a big mess of jQuery
13:42 - for the other one so I'm not even going
13:43 - to try to figure out what I was doing so
13:47 - anyway we're good to go for for this so
13:50 - let's just start out with the title and
13:54 - work our way down and clean this up a
13:57 - bit okay we got I have quite a few
14:06 - things open let me get rid of some of
14:08 - these as I can barely read the I can
14:18 - barely read what these are I have too
14:20 - many open post preview no I don't want
14:24 - the preview with the detail all right so
14:28 - we want to we're gonna be on post detail
14:30 - I do want to let you all know as well
14:33 - that I added a new repository oh cool
14:37 - and rock let me get the end rock started
14:43 - thanks art [ __ ] for reminding me that
14:48 - there we go and if you're not familiar
14:53 - with end rock I'm about to paste a link
14:55 - in the live chat you can go to that link
14:57 - and see the site on your your own
14:59 - browser and inspect it as we work on it
15:03 - you'll see changes live so there we go
15:05 - there's a link in there and I could see
15:08 - a lot of connections happening so that's
15:11 - working
15:12 - I added a new repository on my github
15:17 - profile so not the fus Markham profile
15:22 - and it's a flashcard I think the
15:26 - repositories just called flashcards and
15:28 - that is my first react native app so if
15:32 - anybody's interested in react native you
15:34 - can check that out it's not finished yet
15:37 - so you can't like clone that and have
15:42 - something that's you know ready to go
15:44 - but it has a lot of boilerplate that
15:46 - should work and whenever I'm finished
15:51 - with it oh I'll go over that in a stream
15:54 - and that's that's my final project for
15:57 - the Udacity react nanodegree so just
16:04 - thought I'd put that out there in case
16:05 - anybody's interested I know we haven't
16:06 - actually done any streams of react
16:08 - native but I some of you have asked
16:11 - about it so there's something for now
16:14 - we'll have more on it
16:16 - I don't know when but definitely gonna
16:20 - work with it more because it's pretty
16:21 - cool so let's see now we don't want to
16:25 - get all it down to the drawer there no
16:29 - I'm on the wrong component how did I get
16:31 - there
16:31 - sorry about that it looked like I
16:35 - wondered why all that stuff was in there
16:39 - okay let me make this a bit bigger for
16:43 - you all if you can see and we'll close
16:47 - that side panel there we don't need that
16:52 - okay let's you see we should be bringing
16:59 - in the correct font let me see where
17:05 - we're bringing it in
17:06 - I believe we're using the correct font
17:08 - here we are so
17:17 - how are we using this one let's see
17:29 - it's not once
17:39 - well I want to look at the post preview
17:42 - briefly and see how we're doing it there
17:53 - - my components there there
18:04 - okay so we must we're bringing in
18:06 - typography okay typography type headline
18:14 - all right I knew there was a special
18:16 - component I was pretty sure was
18:18 - typography but I wanted to double check
18:20 - so we need to use this and I don't think
18:26 - I've actually worked with this myself
18:29 - yet so it it seems like we just need to
18:34 - wrap all of our text with typography and
18:41 - just give it a type depending on what
18:45 - the text is supposed to do okay that's
18:51 - what we will do then
18:57 - so on our post detail there's your title
19:14 - whoops did I bring that in
19:20 - actually let me see did we come to some
19:22 - consensus as to whether or not we should
19:24 - keep that link in okay I forgot about
19:38 - that API server
19:40 - alright so sorry for those of you who
19:42 - are trying to use an gerak and it's not
19:44 - working I didn't even think about it so
19:48 - harsh that says please start the backend
19:50 - server in hendrik and use its length
19:52 - okay we're going to start
19:57 - who was that port 8 was a port 8080 I
20:02 - think that was it so yeah let's start
20:08 - that
20:23 - actually how however the hell is this
20:28 - gonna work I'm gonna need to start am I
20:35 - going to need to start both servers and
20:36 - end grok and then and then change the
20:45 - links right
20:53 - hmm this might be a little bit more
20:58 - tricky then how about this for now just
21:03 - to simplify it let's do it like this and
21:10 - we're
21:18 - so I'm going to use this link
21:34 - oops what just happened
21:38 - why does it keep going to drawer
21:43 - why
21:45 - [Music]
22:06 - all right I'm just gonna do this for now
22:09 - I'm not gonna yeah I'm definitely not
22:11 - gonna commit this so this is just
22:13 - temporary just so that it works because
22:15 - I don't I want to get to what I would
22:19 - like to do for this dream so I'm gonna
22:23 - we'll have a better solution at some
22:26 - point but for now that should work so
22:29 - let me know if it's not working I think
22:33 - that should work though okay and it
22:40 - looks like I've gotten some responses
22:42 - here about keeping or not keeping that
22:45 - link so let's go ahead and just take out
22:47 - the link now since we're already in here
22:49 - let's get rid of it
23:03 - oops
23:06 - let's copy where to go
23:12 - we had our post preview let's copy the
23:18 - same headline at least go with type
23:26 - headline and component h2
23:39 - and we don't have these classes set up
23:43 - yet so we'll probably use this class but
23:45 - for now it won't see it we got it just
23:51 - put this actually do I want that's being
23:55 - h1 let's leave that page for a second
24:07 - what kind of tag do we have listen we
24:11 - have that in an h1 I'm gonna put this in
24:18 - an h2 I usually only like to have one h1
24:23 - on a page I might have to look it up and
24:28 - see what's best for SEO actually it
24:32 - doesn't matter this is going to be
24:34 - password protect it's going to be you
24:36 - have to log in to get to it so I don't
24:38 - really care about SEO so anyway I guess
24:41 - it didn't matter but let me get rid of
24:44 - this link before I forget because we're
24:47 - not using this yeah we don't have links
24:50 - anywhere else right now no I don't think
24:56 - we have any more links okay
24:57 - so let's save that oh yeah you're right
25:05 - thanks Sebastian I don't know what I was
25:09 - thinking
25:10 - typography does take care of wrapping
25:12 - that properly so thanks for that okay
25:20 - okay so they can ipsum and just to
25:26 - double-check i'm inspect it is wrapped
25:29 - in an H to my console was quite small
25:36 - but just to show you it turns it into an
25:39 - h2 so you don't actually have to put in
25:41 - an h2 tag you just pass h2 as a prop
25:45 - like this to typography and typography
25:48 - does the rest which is pretty cool okay
25:55 - all right I don't want it to be styled
25:59 - like that for now for now I'm okay with
26:07 - that because I want to see how
26:10 - everything looks in relation to each
26:13 - other before I start to mess with the
26:15 - font size here
26:18 - so now let's maybe we should move the
26:21 - author and date up here let's try that
26:26 - and see how that looks actually doing it
26:28 - author you know what I'm gonna remove
26:29 - the author because we're never gonna
26:32 - have any different authors so we
26:37 - currently don't display authors if we
26:40 - are setting this up as as a blog then
26:43 - definitely keep the author in here but
26:45 - in this case it's not gonna it's not
26:49 - gonna matter
26:52 - let's see or take that out but I do want
27:01 - to bring the date up okay Sebastian is
27:10 - actually recommending that we try type
27:13 - display too
27:17 - okay let's try that out and see what we
27:20 - get
27:24 - oh wow big difference okay that's cool
27:28 - I don't this is not really the look that
27:31 - I wanted but it's cool that we can get
27:34 - these so maybe it'll be worth a shot a
27:37 - little bit later on in the stream to
27:38 - check out the material UI documentation
27:42 - and see what kind of built-in styles
27:44 - they have if we can see see what we have
27:48 - now I think it's just yeah it's
27:50 - basically just this blue color really
27:54 - thin thin font weight and do want to
28:01 - keep actually we should bring the put
28:03 - the category up here as well so instead
28:06 - of author we're gonna pull in the
28:07 - category and display it and then we're
28:11 - gonna bring in the date
28:21 - I'm just looking at harsh it says asks
28:26 - if we use moment js4 date formatting or
28:29 - use my hacky date formatting code
28:34 - actually to be honest with you if the
28:37 - formatting works I mean this this works
28:41 - so I'll take a look at the code but if
28:45 - it works I don't have any problem and
28:47 - it's not like we're doing anything
28:48 - really spectacular with the dates we
28:50 - just need to display it in a readable
28:52 - way so I don't know if there's any
28:56 - reason why I should bring in something
28:57 - like moment J s let me know but it seems
29:01 - to me like it might be overkill for our
29:03 - use case if we find that we need some
29:06 - more functionality in regard to dates
29:10 - then maybe we'll bring it in but for now
29:12 - I think this is fine at least it looks
29:15 - the look of it is is fine
29:19 - let's see my timer just went off so
29:31 - that was crazy those like the fastest
29:34 - time has just been going by really fast
29:36 - today at least for me it seems like it's
29:40 - going by really fast I think that's why
29:42 - part of the reason why I felt like I was
29:44 - going to have a a panic attack
29:49 - just a lot of stuff going on that needs
29:51 - to be done and time is slipping away
29:55 - alright so I've started my five-minute
29:57 - timer I must scroll up to the top of the
29:59 - live chat and answer some questions
30:01 - after that we'll do a bit more code okay
30:05 - oh okay Sebastian says found a UI glitch
30:12 - when you click the three dots icon in
30:14 - the drop-down appears the text of
30:16 - bulletin on the app bar moves to the
30:18 - left okay cool let's check that out
30:29 - all right let's try it from maybe a
30:34 - different interesting okay so I'm not
30:42 - able to recreate that right now maybe
30:46 - maybe it depends on let's see you in
30:50 - your 3d icon yeah maybe it depends
30:52 - somewhat on device I assume you were
30:58 - looking at it with Chrome as well but
31:00 - let me know if you haven't already done
31:03 - this
31:04 - Sebastian put it in an issue and mention
31:08 - the device you're on in the browser and
31:12 - the screen with if you can because
31:16 - something like this could possibly be
31:18 - tied into screen with as well and then
31:21 - we'll see and if anybody else can
31:22 - recreate that please add to that that
31:27 - issue on github I don't
31:30 - I meant issue if I said pull request
31:32 - another Sebastian sorry about that what
31:34 - I meant to say was issue yeah so any
31:40 - laces I can't recreate it right now I
31:42 - can't really do anything about it but
31:46 - definitely want to get that fixed
31:51 - Sebastian says also my PRS is done
31:54 - almost awesome awesome thank you
32:07 - okay so as a so it's easy easy sorry if
32:12 - I'm mispronouncing that let me know how
32:13 - I should pronounce it but as a says
32:16 - sorry but what's the project about today
32:18 - okay so today we're working on this
32:20 - project that is built with react and it
32:24 - pulls in basically posts from WordPress
32:28 - using graph QL and we're pulling that in
32:31 - with Apollo that's working with react
32:37 - and we're displaying those posts and
32:43 - basically this UI setup so today if you
32:46 - haven't already figured it out we're
32:48 - just kind of making this UI look a
32:50 - little bit nicer a little bit more in
32:53 - line with with our style guide which is
32:56 - based primarily on material design
33:12 - okay
33:27 - okay
33:30 - haha Erwin says you're getting a phone
33:33 - call yeah I was you can hear the
33:36 - vibration yeah it was a spam caller most
33:40 - likely
33:50 - okay
33:53 - I might make it through everything in
33:55 - the live chat within these five minutes
33:57 - we'll see oh cool a hard [ __ ] says I
34:08 - will write an N Grogg script and
34:11 - package.json ah that's that's really
34:14 - awesome thank you that would be great
34:21 - Harshit says he just saw the the commits
34:26 - for this project and yes and he mentions
34:30 - he's 13 commits ahead of me and I know I
34:33 - know you are let's uh whoa
34:37 - github is not oh I know I get up isn't
34:40 - the first one here cuz this is Chrome
34:42 - Canary let's see I need to just not use
34:48 - Chrome Canary because uh I'm not logged
34:50 - in on anything than there anyway let me
34:55 - flash on the screen quickly before we
34:57 - start the timer again the contribution
35:00 - stats since since hardship brought it up
35:03 - I want to give everyone credit who
35:06 - deserves credit for this bulletin so
35:15 - here we go
35:16 - so yes Harshit is number one in commits
35:20 - and lagging behind is is me number two
35:24 - so yeah this might be the first time
35:27 - this is happen I think I have been
35:30 - passed up briefly on previous projects
35:33 - but never for more than like a day so
35:38 - this is unique situation but yeah so
35:41 - thank you so much hard you're doing a
35:43 - lot for this project and look at this we
35:45 - have so many contributors now so I
35:49 - really appreciate that that's that's
35:50 - awesome the projects are always so much
35:55 - better when you all contribute so anyway
36:00 - thanks for that I'll have to have to get
36:02 - to work this projects been a little bit
36:04 - odd in terms of Michael
36:05 - distribution because I have some other
36:07 - things that I am working on when I'm not
36:10 - streaming and for this project I almost
36:14 - primarily work on it during streams and
36:17 - I don't do very much at all except
36:19 - review pull requests when I'm not doing
36:22 - a stream so that's why there's not quite
36:24 - as many commits for me on this project
36:27 - because like I said just because of the
36:29 - other things that I have to do also
36:35 - important things but just things that I
36:38 - don't think would be quite as fun for a
36:41 - live stream okay
37:00 - oh okay
37:10 - let's see Sebastian says that the the
37:19 - air only happens from the homepage this
37:22 - is it oops maybe let's try
37:42 - okay so it must be an eel a Sebastian if
37:46 - you remember was was getting a kind of a
37:49 - UI bug here but he was on Windows chrome
37:54 - so I'm on a Mac right now that possibly
37:57 - that's that's part of the issue all
38:02 - right let's go back to one of these here
38:05 - and let's keep going so let's wrap this
38:09 - text in typography and see what it looks
38:14 - like
38:25 - there we go all right
38:31 - and was uh I forgot we were gonna change
38:35 - this weren't we
38:38 - let's yeah let's move this up so we're
38:46 - gonna move the date up here and let's
38:51 - wrap this in typography and what we have
39:00 - a subheading you have a six a subheading
39:07 - I'm not sure what that will look like
39:09 - exactly let's see
39:18 - component
39:20 - let's give it I don't want it to be huge
39:23 - let's try an h4 see how that looks
39:26 - and now let's paste this in and we don't
39:33 - need the H tag so let's see how that
39:41 - looks
39:45 - oh okay that's that's not far off in
39:49 - terms of size what I was thinking so not
39:53 - bad and let's put the kind of in the
39:58 - same size range as the date we're gonna
40:02 - put the category up here
40:16 - yeah let's get rid of that and let me
40:22 - I'm just gonna copy this for now we'll
40:25 - probably put some different styles at
40:29 - some point but for now host I'm not sure
40:44 - if we're even pulling in any data on
40:47 - categories
40:55 - there's a single post t2
41:02 - let's check our posts no we're not we're
41:06 - not bringing in any categories so let's
41:08 - do that here where's our fragments
41:22 - come on interesting
41:32 - I thought we were pulling these in how
41:36 - are we doing this on those preview
42:00 - because we're not pulling it in there
42:02 - we're pulling it in further up okay so
42:05 - what I'm trying to figure out right now
42:07 - is the best way to pull in category data
42:11 - into our single post page let's see
42:19 - thanks honey for reminding me about the
42:25 - my face blocking the timer so I'm trying
42:30 - to figure out how we're getting the
42:31 - categories for the post previews and
42:35 - would like to do that
42:37 - the same way for the post otherwise I
42:40 - mean we could we could certainly just
42:42 - add it in here to get this but I didn't
42:46 - want to duplicate work if we're already
42:48 - doing it so we're we got no I guess
42:56 - either one of these will work they'll be
42:58 - bringing it get all posts so we are just
43:02 - using get all posts all right then
43:14 - Oh coach I understand
43:27 - nothing
43:34 - huh that's odd I really thought I merged
43:39 - the pool request earlier that was doing
43:42 - oh you know what I ended up not merging
43:45 - it let me double check here
43:47 - yeah we're not it was Sebastian's pool
43:50 - request and I didn't merge it already I
43:53 - let me go back to Sebastian's pull
43:56 - request then let's see
44:18 - let's check these pull requests here I'm
44:25 - gonna grab I'm just gonna grab for now
44:27 - the part of this pull request that that
44:30 - does that actually let me see wouldn't
44:32 - you
44:46 - actually you know what I like this I
44:52 - like this how this is right now - let me
45:08 - alright let me say this quickly
45:22 - actually I don't want to commit this
45:25 - part so I'm just gonna commit let me
45:29 - pull over my my terminal so we can see
45:33 - so what I'm going to do is commit what
45:37 - we've done so far and then pull in
45:39 - Sebastian's pull request and then
45:42 - because it looks it looks good now so we
45:46 - might as well just pull that in and then
45:48 - it should make it easier to do what
45:51 - we're trying to do right now so I'm not
45:53 - going to commit the change I made to
45:55 - have an grok work so let's go get add
45:59 - and we're just going to add this views
46:05 - post detail
46:37 - okay if you're not familiar with github
46:40 - basically what we did was we added this
46:42 - file and then once you added is ready to
46:47 - commit we committed it and then we added
46:49 - a commit message then with this git push
46:53 - origin master we sent that change up to
46:56 - the master branch on github now I can
46:59 - merge let's double check and make sure
47:02 - there's no conflicts I'm going to
47:03 - refresh this okay good I didn't think
47:05 - there would be but always get to double
47:08 - check you're gonna merge that great I'm
47:13 - going to leave a great very grateful
47:16 - message
47:34 - alright now let's pull that change in
47:46 - great
47:53 - and
47:57 - yet let me pull this off the page for
48:01 - now let's see okay awesome all right so
48:07 - we have this this is pretty good I'll
48:09 - probably end up messing with the size a
48:12 - little bit but basically this is this is
48:15 - pretty much it so I guess right now if
48:18 - anybody really wants something that
48:22 - would work on something to work on and
48:24 - all I'll make these into issues most
48:26 - likely but the category what I would
48:29 - like is if we click the category it
48:31 - would have the same effect as clicking
48:32 - the category on the side here so that
48:35 - you could easily click it and then go to
48:38 - that category page the category would
48:41 - probably need to be a bit bigger so that
48:44 - it's it's more easily clicked and seen
48:47 - the date looks great I like that
48:50 - with the attachments we might end up
48:53 - doing with the attachments so
48:55 - potentially we might just remove the
48:56 - read more and then if we do that move
48:58 - attachments down to here so they would
49:03 - be below this dividing line probably
49:06 - decrease the size of the of attachments
49:11 - here and then this looks fine this looks
49:14 - great the only difference that I have
49:16 - for these right now is the the font
49:20 - color is lighter so it's probably like
49:23 - if we did like an RGB a black color it
49:27 - would have the opacity of 0.5 for that's
49:31 - usually what I do for that that gray
49:33 - color but that's not really a big deal
49:34 - that's just how I did it the last time
49:38 - the way I said oh oh at some point today
49:44 - or tomorrow probably make some some
49:46 - issues for that okay but otherwise
49:50 - really awesome job on that
49:53 - that looks great so now we should be
49:58 - able to see what
50:04 - she'd be able to see what happened here
50:06 - and yes awesome okay I was really hoping
50:12 - that Sebastian did it this way I thought
50:14 - he did so since he added the categories
50:18 - into this post fragment what we're going
50:20 - to be able to do since we're using what
50:24 - we're not using the fragment here
50:25 - we aren't okay I thought we were already
50:30 - using the fragment for the single post
50:32 - details so let's see if we can work this
50:33 - fragment in into this okay so let's see
50:39 - will impose the state of this fragment
50:44 - let me make sure we can do this
51:01 - ah you know what maybe we don't have
51:05 - this edges we don't have to deal with
51:08 - the edges node for a single post okay no
51:14 - worries it still makes it a heck of a
51:16 - lot easier because now I can just copy
51:17 - this and put that right down here and
51:26 - actually while we're in here let's get
51:27 - rid of the author since we're not going
51:30 - to be using that and let's see me tell
51:33 - you what date okay just checking to see
51:41 - if we could get rid of anything else
51:42 - while we're in here I do want to grab
51:50 - this slug do I want this load
52:03 - I don't think I need this look no I
52:08 - don't what I'd like to do is change
52:14 - these I accidentally all right this is
52:21 - fine so it's hard to see probably on
52:24 - your screen but right now the post still
52:27 - has this ID which is just you know a lot
52:31 - of nonsense ready to us you know just a
52:33 - random string but what I would like to
52:36 - have is the post slug here just like we
52:40 - did for the categories so if you
52:41 - remember so category has the slug which
52:44 - looks a lot nicer so that's what I'd
52:47 - like to do for the posts as well so
52:49 - should be too difficult because we've
52:51 - already done it once for categories but
52:54 - we will need to switch up a little bit
52:57 - about how we're getting that so I'm not
53:00 - going to do that right now but that that
53:03 - is coming okay great so now we should be
53:06 - able to grab the category so while
53:10 - potentially you could have more than one
53:12 - category and WordPress on a single post
53:15 - I am setting the limit at one category
53:19 - for our content managers so we'll never
53:24 - have to worry about more than one
53:25 - category here but let's go ahead and
53:30 - check out our post preview and let's
53:39 - bring in we're just going to bring over
53:43 - exactly the same way we're doing in a
53:45 - post preview we're gonna copy and paste
53:47 - that over and then we can adjust it
53:50 - accordingly
53:59 - there we go
54:13 - bring that in and I think I'm gonna
54:15 - bring over some of these classes now
54:36 - I'm sorry these styles I was looking for
54:40 - Const classes but that's not it's in
54:43 - that lorry we're getting it from okay
54:47 - let me double-check yeah
54:53 - alright let's bring this in now
55:04 - that way it should work whoa okay
55:09 - we need what's undefined you categories
55:12 - not the fine classes all right let's see
55:19 - we would have what I do
55:30 - oh okay I see these are being passed in
55:36 - as props so I can't just say category in
55:39 - this case it would be you end up being
55:59 - beep Oh starts
56:07 - those categories categories it is that
56:14 - actually let me just see how are we
56:18 - passing this
56:51 - area
56:58 - that's what I wanted okay awesome
57:02 - it's post
57:18 - so we won't need this exactly but it'll
57:20 - be close to that so I'm going to copy
57:22 - this over
57:33 - okay so we don't need node this should
57:39 - work we're also gonna need to bring in
57:45 - whoops miss my posts those preview keeps
57:50 - going away we need to bring in some of
57:52 - these colors
58:00 - and let's see what else blue-gray
58:03 - classes in category styles yeah we
58:12 - probably need this huh
58:53 - classes by
59:09 - I don't know why I'm calling this
59:11 - classes right I should be able to just
59:18 - get it like that
59:27 - okay it's kind of what we wanted step in
59:33 - the right direction let's see what I did
59:37 - kind of gory color
60:04 - okay
60:16 - let's see
60:22 - all right Sebastian's explaining what's
60:25 - what's going on here so he says you also
60:28 - have to pass the style as props with
60:31 - styles grids have export to fall West
60:35 - oh okay okay
60:55 - actually can we do this
61:28 - how can we
61:33 - all right how can I add this in and have
61:35 - it work with everything else that's
61:40 - going on I don't think this will work
61:44 - let's try it I feel like we already
61:46 - dealt with this how did we fix this last
61:50 - time
62:00 - okay thanks argit I know we I know I I
62:05 - went through the same thing at some
62:09 - point maybe it was last week
62:14 - yeah which component did we do that in
62:31 - yes we did
62:40 - okay
62:50 - okay cool all right that makes sense as
62:54 - to why I didn't remember the solution
62:57 - because I didn't find it how I found the
62:59 - solution and fixed it in a pull request
63:00 - all right so let's find where that was
63:06 - let's see let's check let's check home
63:18 - category
63:40 - yeah
63:43 - maybe we no longer have that peg
63:46 - component all right okay so I did it
63:59 - wrong
63:59 - let's see
64:13 - Oh
64:40 - all right awesome sorry about that put
64:43 - the the last parentheses in in the wrong
64:49 - spot okay now I can put this back to
64:57 - would not not here over here now I can
65:00 - put this back to what it should have
65:01 - been classes
65:25 - what did I do
65:53 - all right thanks Sebastian for for
65:56 - pasting the everything in there oh okay
66:06 - I see
66:21 - all right thanks Sebastian so if you
66:25 - can't see the live chat right now
66:27 - Sebastian is just coaching me through
66:29 - all of this
66:54 - oops
67:04 - yay all right thank you for all the help
67:07 - uh-huh all right cool it works now so
67:14 - it's amazing how much you forget about a
67:17 - project when you haven't worked on it
67:19 - for a week I've been working mostly on
67:24 - react native huh the last week so works
67:32 - a little bit differently
67:34 - oh that cool my timer went off so it
67:39 - went off a little while ago but I did
67:40 - want to work through that issue before
67:43 - we did question-answer so let me do a
67:47 - short break and go over some of the live
67:52 - chat and well I guess I'm definitely not
67:57 - going to make it to the optional thing
68:03 - that I had at 3 3 o'clock harsh should
68:11 - ask is there any react native for us
68:13 - there will be there will be more react
68:15 - native I almost was going to do react
68:19 - native in the stream but I just ended up
68:25 - not ended up not doing it ok let's go
68:59 - all right so I I found where I left off
69:02 - Alexander says hey Jessie
69:04 - Alexander thanks for joining us in the
69:07 - last chat and it says newcomer welcome
69:16 - thanks for watching thanks for joining
69:19 - us in the live chat feel free to ask any
69:21 - questions
69:35 - see
69:41 - Ryan says hey there what can I learn all
69:44 - of this Brett says start with Jesse's
69:47 - first project using next Jas this is
69:50 - likely the deep end of the pool jack way
69:56 - beyond says I had the same question
70:01 - thanks for answering it yeah I mean you
70:04 - could you could start there or if you go
70:08 - to any we have four projects right now
70:11 - so if you go to day one of any of the
70:14 - four projects that would be good so if
70:17 - if you didn't want to learn about next
70:20 - chance and start with the first you
70:21 - could probably start with day one of any
70:23 - of the projects that would work also
70:27 - these streams aren't really set up like
70:30 - a tutorial so you may need to if you
70:33 - really want to watch the streams you
70:34 - probably will need to supplement with
70:36 - some other stuff because they'll
70:38 - definitely be some gaps you know we
70:40 - don't go over every detail in every step
70:42 - but you definitely get you know you'll
70:48 - you'll learn some things you know as you
70:50 - go along just just from kind of watching
70:52 - the code and how we figure out problems
70:53 - and things like that and feel free to
70:55 - ask any questions that you have
70:58 - you know while it while I'm streaming I
71:00 - get to all the questions eventually
71:03 - California boy says how long have you
71:05 - been coding about five years I I have a
71:12 - much more in-depth explanation of my my
71:16 - coding history on my youtube channel
71:19 - which i think is linked in the
71:21 - description so if you check out my
71:22 - youtube channel there's a video called
71:25 - how I became a front-end developer so
71:29 - check that video out I explain it a lot
71:31 - more but the short answer is like three
71:34 - to five years basically depending on how
71:36 - you really want to define coder so yeah
72:05 - jacobian says is there anyone willing to
72:09 - join study groups I have a lot to catch
72:10 - up on that's actually a great idea so
72:14 - actually at this point I'm super busy
72:16 - with my class and the work and
72:18 - everything so I don't know that I would
72:20 - be that much help in a study group right
72:22 - now but that's a really good idea so if
72:25 - if you are interested in forming some
72:27 - type of study group I definitely I
72:32 - support that and I may be able to help
72:36 - out and be a part of it at some point
72:37 - but definitely not until I finish my
72:40 - class which shouldn't be that much
72:42 - longer I should be finished in November
72:49 - the course in November I also have to
72:51 - give a talk at a conference and I'm
72:53 - gonna have surgery on my wrist so I may
72:55 - not actually be available in November
72:59 - maybe to be more like late December okay
73:16 - brian says it jumps in Internet Explorer
73:19 - 6 also talking about that UI bug ha ha
73:24 - that's a good one
73:26 - I like that it'd be fun to go back and
73:33 - see how the sites we've worked on look
73:35 - in Internet Explorer 6 if they even work
73:38 - at all all right so I tell you what I
73:43 - don't think I want to do a whole nother
73:46 - Pomodoro session but let's let's just
73:51 - start the timer at least so we can have
73:54 - a cutoff point this will be the last
73:56 - session no matter what but what I'd like
73:57 - to do is just style this text a little
74:01 - bit closer to how we want it see how
74:04 - long that takes maybe adjust some of
74:06 - this and make sure that we don't get
74:08 - this big box here so we'll do those few
74:11 - things and and then we'll finish up but
74:15 - I'll answer the rest of the questions in
74:17 - the live chat so let me let me do this
74:21 - and I'm gonna mark where we left off in
74:26 - the chat okay
74:30 - so let's see let's let's just get rid of
74:37 - this right now so we'll just want to
74:41 - conditionally render that image so
74:45 - what's going here and say
74:56 - I guess I'll just copy all this because
75:01 - basically what we want
75:03 - oops that's not what I need what we want
75:11 - isn't this and if we put it here we
75:17 - won't need it
75:18 - and here anymore so if you're not
75:24 - familiar with this this is called let me
75:28 - think it's a short circuit of something
75:34 - I can't remember the exact name of it
75:35 - where's Patrick I haven't seen Patrick
75:39 - in the live chat for a while but I'm
75:42 - pretty sure Patrick told me what the
75:43 - name of this was if somebody knows that
75:45 - let me know but anyway you're
75:50 - short-circuiting the normal logic that's
75:52 - happening here but basically it's just a
75:56 - shorthand way of saying if posts if
76:00 - there is post featured image then render
76:05 - this so that's what now okay Harshit
76:11 - said it's conditional running yeah it's
76:13 - conditional rendering but when you just
76:14 - do the the and here instead of like a
76:17 - normal little ternary it was it's called
76:20 - something about short-circuiting but I
76:22 - just can't remember if there's more to
76:24 - it than just saying short-circuit so
76:27 - anyway basically we're doing the same
76:29 - thing that we were doing in the source
76:31 - but now we're doing it for the entire
76:34 - component for the entire element I guess
76:36 - it's not really a component so that'll
76:42 - get rid of the box so let's just just
76:44 - see what happens there we go okay but if
76:51 - we go to something that has an image it
76:55 - will display it so not bad that was an
77:00 - easy fix
77:01 - let's
77:04 - go back to one without without the image
77:08 - because then the I really want to see
77:11 - the comparison of text size once we
77:15 - change the font size here so I that'll
77:18 - be easier if they're closer together in
77:20 - this case
77:33 - oh that's it all right
77:37 - okay so rook rook has it here this so
77:42 - basically I'm summarizing what rook has
77:45 - just said in the live chat what happened
77:47 - so normally when you have an end right
77:50 - you'd be saying if this is true and
77:53 - whatever else out here is true then do
77:57 - something but basically how it works
78:00 - with an and operator is if the first one
78:04 - is true it never looks for the second
78:07 - value because this is if one or the
78:10 - other is true so it doesn't care what's
78:14 - on the other side right so that's why we
78:16 - can short-circuit it because in reality
78:19 - right we we're not checking for a second
78:22 - value so this will say well in in a
78:27 - sense I shouldn't say that because if
78:29 - this is false right we we do want to
78:34 - check right but in the case that this is
78:38 - true it'll just automatically render
78:41 - that right does that make sense
78:50 - yeah alright cool so in in booze Matt
78:55 - sorry if I've mispronounced that but in
78:58 - booze Matt says yeah if the expression
78:59 - gets too and while resolving to
79:02 - something fall see it just exits cool it
79:08 - so anyway that's just it's kind of just
79:11 - that a very concise way of writing it
79:15 - and so you'll see that a lot in the
79:18 - different repositories that we've been
79:20 - working on so let's see alright so that
79:28 - works now we need to instead of
79:31 - dangerous you said enter HTML okay
79:35 - how are we gonna do this I'm not sure if
79:44 - we'll be able to use typography here
79:55 - well we can try it out and see let's
79:57 - just try it
80:09 - okay it looks like Sebastian Sebastian
80:11 - and horse should say you can so let's go
80:13 - ahead with that and see tight oh it
80:22 - looks like we can just set innerhtml
80:25 - grades cool
80:38 - so we don't even need that div let's
80:41 - give this I'm not sure what all the type
80:45 - options are but I'm assuming there's a
80:48 - type option for paragraph maybe maybe we
80:54 - should just check since we have the docs
80:58 - open anyway let's check this out
81:03 - typography here we go
81:10 - typography type body okay let's call it
81:19 - body 21 and do we need huh interesting
81:41 - okay so we can put this component
81:55 - really I we want this to be a div really
82:01 - because the content that we're going to
82:03 - get is already going to be formatted
82:05 - with paragraph tags so let's see how
82:08 - this looks
82:17 - mmm okay wait a second he's gonna post
82:21 - preview no nobody's face okay Sebastian
82:28 - says using it in post cream you let's
82:33 - see
82:40 - okay Sebastian is using body to with the
82:44 - gutter bottom okay
82:54 - let's see if 42 makes makes it look
82:58 - different
83:02 - okay I see slightly different look at
83:08 - font size still looks really small to me
83:12 - I'm gonna check to see what the size is
83:15 - here
83:29 - oh yeah 14 pixels yeah I don't like that
83:35 - yeah I definitely want a bigger font
83:38 - size here so we may end up
83:55 - we could change the typography styles
84:01 - for the theme maybe we'll do that
84:28 - okay so it looks like Sebastian says try
84:34 - display one harsh it says try headline
84:37 - okay let's let's at least try those
84:39 - before we start overriding things if you
84:42 - remember in our last project we use
84:45 - material UI but we brought in that
84:46 - responsive font all those that CSS that
84:51 - changed the font size based on media
84:53 - queries I actually really like that so
84:59 - we may bring that in anyway but I do
85:02 - want to see what these look like so
85:05 - let's try what was the first one display
85:08 - one let's try that out
85:17 - okay much bigger yeah I don't I like
85:25 - this size better than the first one but
85:28 - I definitely would want a different
85:30 - color and probably a different font wait
85:35 - let's try this other one who was it
85:38 - headline
85:47 - oh okay that's actually not bad I like
85:50 - that color better again I'm I'm I'm more
85:57 - fond of the thinner font wait that's not
86:05 - bad
86:10 - let's see how that looks also with a
86:17 - something with an image oh actually I
86:24 - think it looks better it looks it better
86:26 - with an image that's not bad okay I
86:34 - think we're going to go with this for
86:35 - now I'm still thinking about checking
86:39 - out the maybe integrating that that font
86:44 - that responsive font into here maybe
86:49 - maybe I could do it in a way that like
86:52 - let's say let's take that body 1 or body
86:55 - 2 and customize that basically override
87:01 - the default styles and instead make it
87:03 - have all the styles that we want from
87:06 - that responsive font that way we don't
87:09 - have to in our components you know add
87:11 - an extra class into each one instead we
87:15 - can just use body I don't know if it's
87:18 - possible to make an additional one like
87:22 - for instance we can make up our own type
87:26 - I'm sure it's possible but I don't know
87:28 - if there's a proper way to do that I
87:31 - don't want to directly edit material UI
87:35 - files for instance like in our node
87:39 - modules folder so anyway but not bad I
87:45 - think this it's not a hundred percent to
87:49 - where I want it
87:49 - I just want to mess I think with font
87:51 - weights and sizes and maybe the coloring
87:56 - just a bit but for now it's not that and
88:01 - I actually I mean at this size of those
88:04 - good it's still you know if we have a
88:08 - large screen like this I still don't
88:12 - like how how long this is so I don't
88:16 - know a margin might not be a bad idea
88:22 - and also I'm not sure about the image
88:25 - like this if I'm gonna have I don't know
88:31 - that I want a huge image that spans this
88:34 - this whole way I think maybe margins are
88:39 - our best bet to handle that because then
88:42 - that way we don't need a big image for
88:46 - it to look okay because I don't think it
88:48 - looks okay like this but I don't think
88:50 - it would look alright if it were just
88:51 - centered and you still had this hanging
88:53 - over the sides I could do with this
88:56 - being perhaps a bit bigger if we if we
89:01 - had some margins on the side but I don't
89:05 - want the text extending beyond it hmm
89:15 - not bad
89:36 - okay all right I think that's that's not
89:40 - bad for for today let's see we have gone
89:47 - over some things so there are some
89:49 - things that aren't issues yet officially
89:52 - in in github but we've gone over them in
89:55 - the stream so if if anybody like to make
89:58 - them an issue or work on them before I
90:00 - get around to officially putting them in
90:02 - to our github repo then feel free to do
90:06 - that and once again I I completely
90:09 - understand none of you are on and under
90:11 - any obligation to help out with this
90:13 - project and I really really appreciate
90:15 - all your time I mean these projects I
90:19 - you know I know it's nice you can build
90:21 - up your your github profile with with
90:26 - some of this work if you know if you're
90:29 - looking to to do some work on you know
90:31 - some real sites that are you know that
90:34 - are gonna go live or in use but I you
90:38 - know I really really appreciate it so I
90:42 - just don't ever want to feel like I once
90:44 - you ought to feel like I expect you to
90:45 - do something I don't I would still do
90:48 - this dream if no one ever contributed
90:50 - anything and it was all me so don't
90:55 - don't feel like I I expect it right but
90:59 - when it happens I'm very very
91:01 - appreciative and I always learn a lot
91:04 - from your code whenever you you submit
91:07 - things
91:10 - okay so I've scrolled back up to our
91:13 - left off in the live chat I'm going to
91:15 - go down and answer any questions so if
91:19 - you're not interested in sticking around
91:20 - for the question-and-answer session I
91:22 - totally understand thanks for watching
91:25 - so far and I should be back tomorrow so
91:28 - hopefully I'll see you then otherwise if
91:31 - you have a little bit of time I'd love
91:32 - if you could hang out for a bit in the
91:34 - live chat ask questions and answer
91:36 - questions because I could definitely use
91:39 - your expertise and helping answer some
91:41 - of these questions all right so
91:50 - let's see oh okay Harshit says he knows
91:55 - the cause of that UI bug says it is due
91:58 - to the display of y-axis scrollbar in
92:02 - the drawer oh okay
92:07 - but says it's but it's not that big of a
92:09 - deal it's only a four to seven pixel
92:12 - shift so the so let's see this this
92:18 - actually makes a lot of sense that I'm
92:20 - not seeing it on a Mac now so let's try
92:25 - to so assuming this we talk about the
92:34 - scrollbar in the drawer Macs and other
92:38 - systems handle scroll bars differently
92:41 - so if you're on a Windows system and it
92:45 - was like this on a Mac you can't see the
92:48 - scrollbar and so you actually scroll on
92:49 - Windows there would be a scrollbar there
92:52 - so I'm assuming that that potentially
92:55 - has something to do with that
92:58 - positioning and then I suppose that when
93:02 - this shows up it oops it changes
93:06 - something maybe it hides the scroll I'm
93:09 - not really sure because I can't see it
93:11 - on Windows right now I can check it out
93:14 - with browser stack later on so I'll
93:19 - check that out I mean you're right
93:20 - Harshit it's not really that big of a
93:22 - deal but if we have time we may as well
93:25 - try to try to figure it out
93:50 - okay harsh it says Jessie don't refer to
93:53 - get as github it will surely create
93:56 - confusion among the newbies yeah you're
93:58 - definitely right so sorry if I if I do
94:02 - that so I don't I don't remember when I
94:06 - said that earlier on it was a while ago
94:09 - when when horseshit brought that up but
94:11 - yeah so for anybody who is new and not
94:15 - familiar with git and github git is a
94:18 - version control system that you can use
94:21 - with or without github so github is a
94:24 - website where people put their git
94:26 - repositories so that you can other
94:29 - people can see them browse them look at
94:31 - the code and easily submit pull requests
94:36 - and in clone repositories so there is a
94:40 - big difference between github and get so
94:45 - if I mess up and say github when I
94:50 - should be saying get please call me out
94:52 - on that so I can correct it and I don't
94:55 - want to confuse anyone okay a few
95:02 - minutes ago when I said if you can't
95:04 - stick around for the chat then you know
95:06 - feel free to go I guess a lot of people
95:08 - took me up on that offer because right
95:11 - after that the viewership just drunk
95:15 - let's see and use this as a lager one
95:20 - hey how's it going thanks for joining us
95:50 - Satya as are you learning react native
95:52 - from Udacity yes I am so the Udacity
95:57 - nano degree takes you through three
96:00 - projects the first project is just basic
96:03 - react with reactor Otto so you choose
96:07 - create react app and react router to do
96:09 - a really basic react app the second
96:15 - project you add in Redux it's a little
96:18 - bit more complex the third project you
96:20 - use react native that's what I'm working
96:22 - on right now and it's an app where you
96:26 - have you can make decks of flashcards
96:28 - and then you can take quizzes based on
96:32 - those flashcards and it gives you a
96:33 - grade on how well you did
96:36 - you can add flash cards to your decks so
96:40 - it's actually going to be somewhat
96:42 - useful I think after I make it I'll
96:46 - teach my kids how to use it and they can
96:48 - use it to help them study of you know
96:51 - for their tests at school
97:00 - let's see okay harsh it says you know
97:03 - Jessie these these are all rappers use
97:06 - higher-order components for passing
97:07 - props let's see I made one in Maya fun
97:17 - ocation blog I'm trying to follow the
97:22 - see if there's anything left okay yeah
97:30 - okay cool yeah hard [ __ ] I haven't
97:33 - really looked into how this particular
97:35 - version of material UI does everything
97:38 - so yeah so I'm not super familiar with
97:40 - what's going on behind the scenes but
97:45 - I'm sure after I use it this is the
97:47 - first project that I ever use it on this
97:51 - this particular version of material UI
97:53 - so sure after I work with it for a
97:55 - little while longer I'll get used to how
97:58 - everything how everything's supposed to
98:01 - work
98:14 - Harshit says start from learn codecademy
98:17 - channel i started from there yeah I'm
98:21 - I'm not sure somebody must have asked
98:23 - about learning react or something like
98:27 - that anyway yeah I definitely recommend
98:32 - that channel as well so that's one of my
98:36 - top channels for learning more about
98:38 - react or JavaScript in particular so the
98:42 - videos a lot of the videos are kind of
98:44 - old but the the basic principles are
98:46 - still really good
98:48 - so that's will Stearns YouTube channel
98:51 - learn code Academy I learned so much
98:55 - with that a couple years ago when I was
98:58 - really trying to learn more about
99:01 - JavaScript I watched a horse that's
99:04 - handled quite a bit Nisar says favour us
99:10 - by react native with expo only no native
99:14 - development for us with Windows OS yeah
99:17 - yeah we're not right now I'm working
99:20 - with Expo and react native we're
99:23 - definitely not going to do native
99:25 - development will stick with JavaScript
99:29 - I'm still learning in JavaScript and
99:32 - want to focus on that so I won't be
99:35 - switching it up with with anything else
99:37 - right now Hubley blake slate he was
99:44 - building a desk
99:45 - let's go that sounds cool I'm building a
99:47 - desk is it a nice desk let's see
100:30 - okay I got to the bow on the live chat
100:33 - Blake's asking about the end rock link
100:35 - so I am gonna pass this in Blake I'm
100:38 - gonna paste this in I mean the end rock
100:40 - link and I'll leave it running for a
100:44 - little while I'll shut it down before I
100:46 - leave today so even if I end the stream
100:49 - you'll be able to check it out for a
100:51 - little while so here's that link cool
100:58 - harsh it says we are happy to contribute
101:00 - is nice get featured in the stream
101:03 - oh cool well I'm glad you're happy and
101:05 - actually I totally forgot about that
101:08 - I guess it is kind of cool to get to get
101:11 - featured on the stream for free code
101:13 - camp so yeah definitely I it anyone that
101:18 - contributes at some point I will thank
101:21 - you on the stream and make I try to make
101:26 - a big deal about it so let's see Blake
101:31 - says yes I'm building at my local
101:33 - woodworking guild they have classes for
101:35 - youth cool says okay I don't need long
101:40 - maybe 20 minutes all right cool yeah but
101:43 - I'll definitely leave that anger out
101:44 - link up for 20 minutes maybe more that's
101:49 - pretty cool that that you're doing some
101:51 - woodworking stuff I I used to be more
101:57 - into building things like doing some
101:59 - construction work and things but I've
102:02 - just been way too busy for it now and
102:04 - after I I tore some ligaments in my
102:07 - wrist I really shouldn't be using it
102:09 - that much so I haven't haven't done much
102:11 - building recently okay issue screenshot
102:20 - oh great so harsh it has taken a
102:24 - screenshot of the issue I'm assuming
102:28 - that this is that UI bug let me take a
102:32 - look at that right now and see if I can
102:34 - put that
102:37 - oh okay great let's see so let me bring
102:41 - this over so here it is so you can see
102:44 - the the logout is is open there and
102:51 - bulletin is right up against there yes
102:54 - so that's definitely definitely not how
102:58 - it should look so you know it's only a
103:01 - very specific case when that would
103:03 - happen okay all right that's cool I'll
103:11 - try to okay and this is actually on a
103:15 - Mac and this this looks like from one of
103:19 - my interesting I wonder why I can't get
103:21 - it to to happen hmm I mean I am in
103:28 - Chrome Canary
103:30 - so I guess but potentially I could try
103:34 - it give it a shot whoa what's going on
103:53 - it's
104:08 - okay something must have been cashed all
104:12 - right since I still can't recreate it
104:19 - oh well I'll figure it out at some point
104:26 - Oh
104:30 - Harshit said it was a loon - okay that
104:38 - was weird it it had I did it had on the
104:42 - other side I thought I saw that it had
104:44 - the the icon for for Mac it had the
104:55 - Apple er anyway okay so that makes more
104:59 - sense
105:11 - okay so it's the Apple theme for Linux
105:14 - alright that makes more sense all right
105:26 - cool I should be able to recreate it if
105:28 - I just run it on using browser stack
105:33 - I'll run it on a Windows Windows machine
105:39 - so let's see I think that's it I think
105:45 - I've covered everything in the live chat
105:46 - if I miss your question I apologize so
105:52 - you know you can ask me again the next
105:54 - time I stream or send me a message on
105:56 - Twitter or something and I'd be happy to
105:58 - answer your question you can also write
106:01 - you know put a comment on this video as
106:03 - well I don't think quite as good of a
106:06 - job of getting back to all the comments
106:07 - because that I have a lot of videos it's
106:10 - kind of hard to track it down
106:11 - and especially since there's so many
106:14 - other people contributing this channel
106:15 - sometimes it's hard to sift through the
106:18 - comments on all the other videos so
106:20 - sometimes they get lost and I don't even
106:22 - realize they're there because they get
106:23 - so far down the list before I even get a
106:25 - chance to check so if you've commented
106:29 - on a video and I haven't responded it's
106:31 - probably because that's happened and
106:33 - it's gotten lost you know buried and all
106:35 - the rest of the comments so I'm not
106:37 - purposely ignoring it I probably just
106:39 - never saw it and sometimes I do try to
106:44 - go back but there I actually don't know
106:46 - how many videos I've done I haven't
106:48 - counted so but there are a lot so it's
106:52 - quite a bit to look through so so if you
106:54 - really need to answer to something you
106:57 - know send me a direct message on some
107:00 - form of social media and that's probably
107:02 - the the surest way to get get the answer
107:05 - so
107:10 - all right oh yes I should says is is
107:19 - requesting that I merge PR 39 it'll
107:22 - solve the male issues okay cool I'll
107:24 - check it out I can't guarantee I'll
107:26 - merge PR 39 today because to be honest
107:30 - with you I've already I'm already over
107:34 - my my work time for today so I'm into I
107:37 - don't get paid extra for overtime and
107:39 - I'm into overtime so I'm probably gonna
107:41 - try to leave soon and I just got a text
107:44 - from my wife that I gotta run to the
107:47 - store and pick up a bunch of stuff oh so
107:53 - I'm gonna be a I gotta go to run some
107:55 - errands but tomorrow morning I should be
107:59 - able to I don't I don't have any
108:01 - meetings tomorrow morning so I should be
108:03 - able to get everything merged and then
108:07 - alright awesome so anyway this was a
108:10 - good stream didn't really get in
108:13 - anything too difficult you know just
108:15 - some basic stuff but it was a nice
108:18 - stream and definitely enjoyed you know
108:23 - talking with you all and I should like I
108:28 - said it should be back tomorrow probably
108:31 - around 2:00 we'll see I'll schedule I'll
108:34 - try to schedule the stream a little bit
108:35 - earlier in the day I know today was
108:38 - somewhat short notice I don't think I
108:40 - got a scheduled until less than an hour
108:42 - before I came on so I'd like to give you
108:47 - a little bit more of notice tomorrow if
108:49 - I can

109:04 - to mess up the pronunciation but I have
109:06 - it have a great time with that and I
109:09 - will see everyone tomorrow

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse sorry about that I'm two minutes late this is two days in a row I'm late I was having some technical difficulties so the stream the stream wouldn't start it was entirely my fault though is user error so also I was trying to finish off the done up before the stream started I almost did it there's like maybe two bites left so today is probably going to be a really short stream less than an hour there's a non mandatory event going on at 300 I still haven't decided in entirely whether or not I'm gonna go I probably should go but to be honest I felt like I'm gonna have a panic attack for the last hour I'm not exactly sure why I just I think I just have a lot of stuff going on right now and time's running out so streaking me out a little bit so I'd rather have a panic attack in my office and then have a panic attack in front of the entire university so we'll see maybe I'll go maybe I won't I'm thinking thy screaming will help me take my mind off of everything and feel better so I haven't had a panic attack in a really long time so I don't I don't think it'll happen we'll see enough about my mental health let's get started I've chosen today to work on some easy stuff you know just some basic UI things I I had some other ideas I wanted to get started on the authentication but I don't think I have enough information yet to really get started I've been waiting back to hear back from someone in the IT department let's see I just got an email back from some I'm looking at it right now so okay I'm gonna have to review that a little bit a little bit better after the stream but all right so let's let's get started let's let's do some work on this and I've gotten a lot of pool requests so I think what I'll do is I'd like to get just get started and get to work and then maybe we'll see if we have some time we can review the pool request later on in the stream I really appreciate everybody submitting requests I had some some new people who've never submitted pool requests before to the projects and that's awesome so thanks and I'm gonna keep putting up issues so I've already got up more issues I think maybe I think like seven new issues maybe maybe less than seven and you all are awesome it's it's like as soon as I post the issues someone's saying hey I'll I'll take that one so that's great so let me show you first what we're gonna work on and then we'll do it and I'll start my timer so if you're new to the show the timer is to kind of break things up a little bit so we'll do 25 minutes of coding and then we'll take a fiveminute break and I'll go to the live chat and answer any questions that you all have and then we'll go back and forth like that and and then at the end of the stream if there are any questions that I couldn't get to which usually happens then I'll get to all the questions so if you have asked something and I'm not getting to it right away just be patient and I will get to it before I am the stream okay so this is what I want to work on so I this particular page really obvious that I need some work with UI so one of the recent changes is this is now a link which obviously has changed the style so we want to change this obviously I don't want it to be this color I don't want the underline underneath actually I don't even want it to be that font that's kind of odd yeah so a lot has to change so font font has to change across the board in font size a lot of things positioning has to change in this particular case there's no image uploaded so I don't even want there to be an image here I'm also considering adding some margins in I don't know it's not obvious in this post but if we can find another post let's find one with some some more text content you know in this case that it doesn't really look great to have you know have this text all the way across like that so I think we have two options the first option which will probably try out is if we make this font larger it may not look quite as bad because there won't be so many characters across one line or potentially we could add some margins and on the sides and then there won't be so many characters on one line the solution is probably going to end up being a mix of both we'll see so those are my main the main things that I'd like to change I do want to show you how I displayed single posts on the current version of this so let's see I just noticed Sebastian's question at the bottom a live chat here asking why do you want that as a link you are already in the post yes so I actually didn't request that to be a link it was just added in on the pool request that made so what I wanted was this to be a link these titles and then that was just added in I left it in there for now because it's not for right now it's not hurting anything I know I have seen it before particularly with some WordPress sites that it does act like that that the title was always a link no matter what I was going to give it I just merge this pull request a little a little while ago today so I was going to give it some time to think if there would be a good use case for that link before I take it out if I can't think of anything within the next day or two I probably will take it out but for now I need to style that title anyway even before it was a link I wanted to restyle it so it's not really going to be that big of a deal for now so if anybody can think of a use case where we would actually want that to be a link let me know I'm having trouble thinking of it so otherwise I will I will take that out but in that case I liked what was done in the pull request it met all the requirements for that issue so I wanted to go ahead and merge it anyway even though it had that as well in there so so that's that's why so let's see oh I see several reviewers saying that today is Diwali hopefully I'm pronouncing that right so I'm not I'm actually not familiar with Diwali so harsh it says it's like Christmas here so I don't know what the appropriate greeting is so I'll just say you know okay it's happy do all right so happy Diwali to everyone and so for those of you that celebrate that I hope you have a great time okay it's a festival in India cool so I'm just I'm just gonna wish you all a happy time there so I don't really know that much about it so I don't want to be offensive or say something silly about it I limit my comments to that so there's not really a big Indian population where I live so I'm not I'm not that familiar with with Indian customs so so sorry for my ignorance in that area let's see but I know I I do have quite a few viewers from India so so I hope everyone has a good time hey it's a festival of lights cool that sounds cool lots of lights and firecrackers cool that sounds pretty awesome alright maybe I'll have to look up something after the stream about it let's see I guess I checked they're not need to figure out what I was doing ok yeah so we basically gone over oh I know what I was gonna show you sorry I was going to show you how how I'm doing this now with the current bulletin but V aam says please say my name so the young child re I'm really sorry if I'm mispronouncing that I'm sure I am but vo um there you go I said your name thanks for watching thanks for being in the live Shack and I'll see this is I'm on Chrome Canary in this window and I'm not signed in so let me let me go to my other browser window inside since I'm already signed in there this is just regular Chrome there we go alright so this is how I'm displaying things here it's actually in a modal the URL does change so each one of these has its own URL but it's displayed as a modal so I don't exactly have the same issues since it's not an entirely different page the reason I did this in a modal is because I wanted to allow users to keep their place you know we have an infinite scroll implemented so if users are scrolling for a really long time I didn't want their place to get lost so that's why I ended up doing it like this so I think that's still important if there's a way to let a user keep their place so that when they go back so for instance here right we've we've gone to another page if we could go back and have them keep their place I'm okay with with having it on its separate separate page that's oh that was actually my first choice for the original version of the bulletin but like I said I changed it for that reason so they could keep their place so let's see how I should keep saying PR 39 all right I haven't checked if you submitted a PR within the last hour I haven't looked at it yet so I guess I could take a look at PR 39 right now and see what's in let me see what your 13 item back inhouse okay you know what hard [ __ ] I did see this one I didn't get to go through everything with it but I can see so I did see that that will probably be merged in at some point probably tomorrow so I'll get that merged in Sunni let me actually let's do it like this we could probably test this out so I'm gonna scroll all the way down I'm gonna click this and then I'm gonna click back great we're still in the same spot awesome so we're good to go with this for whatever reason the way I built it the other one it wasn't keeping a user's place so I don't know I don't know what was going on that's a big mess of jQuery for the other one so I'm not even going to try to figure out what I was doing so anyway we're good to go for for this so let's just start out with the title and work our way down and clean this up a bit okay we got I have quite a few things open let me get rid of some of these as I can barely read the I can barely read what these are I have too many open post preview no I don't want the preview with the detail all right so we want to we're gonna be on post detail I do want to let you all know as well that I added a new repository oh cool and rock let me get the end rock started thanks art [ __ ] for reminding me that there we go and if you're not familiar with end rock I'm about to paste a link in the live chat you can go to that link and see the site on your your own browser and inspect it as we work on it you'll see changes live so there we go there's a link in there and I could see a lot of connections happening so that's working I added a new repository on my github profile so not the fus Markham profile and it's a flashcard I think the repositories just called flashcards and that is my first react native app so if anybody's interested in react native you can check that out it's not finished yet so you can't like clone that and have something that's you know ready to go but it has a lot of boilerplate that should work and whenever I'm finished with it oh I'll go over that in a stream and that's that's my final project for the Udacity react nanodegree so just thought I'd put that out there in case anybody's interested I know we haven't actually done any streams of react native but I some of you have asked about it so there's something for now we'll have more on it I don't know when but definitely gonna work with it more because it's pretty cool so let's see now we don't want to get all it down to the drawer there no I'm on the wrong component how did I get there sorry about that it looked like I wondered why all that stuff was in there okay let me make this a bit bigger for you all if you can see and we'll close that side panel there we don't need that okay let's you see we should be bringing in the correct font let me see where we're bringing it in I believe we're using the correct font here we are so how are we using this one let's see it's not once well I want to look at the post preview briefly and see how we're doing it there my components there there okay so we must we're bringing in typography okay typography type headline all right I knew there was a special component I was pretty sure was typography but I wanted to double check so we need to use this and I don't think I've actually worked with this myself yet so it it seems like we just need to wrap all of our text with typography and just give it a type depending on what the text is supposed to do okay that's what we will do then so on our post detail there's your title whoops did I bring that in actually let me see did we come to some consensus as to whether or not we should keep that link in okay I forgot about that API server alright so sorry for those of you who are trying to use an gerak and it's not working I didn't even think about it so harsh that says please start the backend server in hendrik and use its length okay we're going to start who was that port 8 was a port 8080 I think that was it so yeah let's start that actually how however the hell is this gonna work I'm gonna need to start am I going to need to start both servers and end grok and then and then change the links right hmm this might be a little bit more tricky then how about this for now just to simplify it let's do it like this and we're so I'm going to use this link oops what just happened why does it keep going to drawer why all right I'm just gonna do this for now I'm not gonna yeah I'm definitely not gonna commit this so this is just temporary just so that it works because I don't I want to get to what I would like to do for this dream so I'm gonna we'll have a better solution at some point but for now that should work so let me know if it's not working I think that should work though okay and it looks like I've gotten some responses here about keeping or not keeping that link so let's go ahead and just take out the link now since we're already in here let's get rid of it oops let's copy where to go we had our post preview let's copy the same headline at least go with type headline and component h2 and we don't have these classes set up yet so we'll probably use this class but for now it won't see it we got it just put this actually do I want that's being h1 let's leave that page for a second what kind of tag do we have listen we have that in an h1 I'm gonna put this in an h2 I usually only like to have one h1 on a page I might have to look it up and see what's best for SEO actually it doesn't matter this is going to be password protect it's going to be you have to log in to get to it so I don't really care about SEO so anyway I guess it didn't matter but let me get rid of this link before I forget because we're not using this yeah we don't have links anywhere else right now no I don't think we have any more links okay so let's save that oh yeah you're right thanks Sebastian I don't know what I was thinking typography does take care of wrapping that properly so thanks for that okay okay so they can ipsum and just to doublecheck i'm inspect it is wrapped in an H to my console was quite small but just to show you it turns it into an h2 so you don't actually have to put in an h2 tag you just pass h2 as a prop like this to typography and typography does the rest which is pretty cool okay all right I don't want it to be styled like that for now for now I'm okay with that because I want to see how everything looks in relation to each other before I start to mess with the font size here so now let's maybe we should move the author and date up here let's try that and see how that looks actually doing it author you know what I'm gonna remove the author because we're never gonna have any different authors so we currently don't display authors if we are setting this up as as a blog then definitely keep the author in here but in this case it's not gonna it's not gonna matter let's see or take that out but I do want to bring the date up okay Sebastian is actually recommending that we try type display too okay let's try that out and see what we get oh wow big difference okay that's cool I don't this is not really the look that I wanted but it's cool that we can get these so maybe it'll be worth a shot a little bit later on in the stream to check out the material UI documentation and see what kind of builtin styles they have if we can see see what we have now I think it's just yeah it's basically just this blue color really thin thin font weight and do want to keep actually we should bring the put the category up here as well so instead of author we're gonna pull in the category and display it and then we're gonna bring in the date I'm just looking at harsh it says asks if we use moment js4 date formatting or use my hacky date formatting code actually to be honest with you if the formatting works I mean this this works so I'll take a look at the code but if it works I don't have any problem and it's not like we're doing anything really spectacular with the dates we just need to display it in a readable way so I don't know if there's any reason why I should bring in something like moment J s let me know but it seems to me like it might be overkill for our use case if we find that we need some more functionality in regard to dates then maybe we'll bring it in but for now I think this is fine at least it looks the look of it is is fine let's see my timer just went off so that was crazy those like the fastest time has just been going by really fast today at least for me it seems like it's going by really fast I think that's why part of the reason why I felt like I was going to have a a panic attack just a lot of stuff going on that needs to be done and time is slipping away alright so I've started my fiveminute timer I must scroll up to the top of the live chat and answer some questions after that we'll do a bit more code okay oh okay Sebastian says found a UI glitch when you click the three dots icon in the dropdown appears the text of bulletin on the app bar moves to the left okay cool let's check that out all right let's try it from maybe a different interesting okay so I'm not able to recreate that right now maybe maybe it depends on let's see you in your 3d icon yeah maybe it depends somewhat on device I assume you were looking at it with Chrome as well but let me know if you haven't already done this Sebastian put it in an issue and mention the device you're on in the browser and the screen with if you can because something like this could possibly be tied into screen with as well and then we'll see and if anybody else can recreate that please add to that that issue on github I don't I meant issue if I said pull request another Sebastian sorry about that what I meant to say was issue yeah so any laces I can't recreate it right now I can't really do anything about it but definitely want to get that fixed Sebastian says also my PRS is done almost awesome awesome thank you okay so as a so it's easy easy sorry if I'm mispronouncing that let me know how I should pronounce it but as a says sorry but what's the project about today okay so today we're working on this project that is built with react and it pulls in basically posts from WordPress using graph QL and we're pulling that in with Apollo that's working with react and we're displaying those posts and basically this UI setup so today if you haven't already figured it out we're just kind of making this UI look a little bit nicer a little bit more in line with with our style guide which is based primarily on material design okay okay haha Erwin says you're getting a phone call yeah I was you can hear the vibration yeah it was a spam caller most likely okay I might make it through everything in the live chat within these five minutes we'll see oh cool a hard [ __ ] says I will write an N Grogg script and package.json ah that's that's really awesome thank you that would be great Harshit says he just saw the the commits for this project and yes and he mentions he's 13 commits ahead of me and I know I know you are let's uh whoa github is not oh I know I get up isn't the first one here cuz this is Chrome Canary let's see I need to just not use Chrome Canary because uh I'm not logged in on anything than there anyway let me flash on the screen quickly before we start the timer again the contribution stats since since hardship brought it up I want to give everyone credit who deserves credit for this bulletin so here we go so yes Harshit is number one in commits and lagging behind is is me number two so yeah this might be the first time this is happen I think I have been passed up briefly on previous projects but never for more than like a day so this is unique situation but yeah so thank you so much hard you're doing a lot for this project and look at this we have so many contributors now so I really appreciate that that's that's awesome the projects are always so much better when you all contribute so anyway thanks for that I'll have to have to get to work this projects been a little bit odd in terms of Michael distribution because I have some other things that I am working on when I'm not streaming and for this project I almost primarily work on it during streams and I don't do very much at all except review pull requests when I'm not doing a stream so that's why there's not quite as many commits for me on this project because like I said just because of the other things that I have to do also important things but just things that I don't think would be quite as fun for a live stream okay oh okay let's see Sebastian says that the the air only happens from the homepage this is it oops maybe let's try okay so it must be an eel a Sebastian if you remember was was getting a kind of a UI bug here but he was on Windows chrome so I'm on a Mac right now that possibly that's that's part of the issue all right let's go back to one of these here and let's keep going so let's wrap this text in typography and see what it looks like there we go all right and was uh I forgot we were gonna change this weren't we let's yeah let's move this up so we're gonna move the date up here and let's wrap this in typography and what we have a subheading you have a six a subheading I'm not sure what that will look like exactly let's see component let's give it I don't want it to be huge let's try an h4 see how that looks and now let's paste this in and we don't need the H tag so let's see how that looks oh okay that's that's not far off in terms of size what I was thinking so not bad and let's put the kind of in the same size range as the date we're gonna put the category up here yeah let's get rid of that and let me I'm just gonna copy this for now we'll probably put some different styles at some point but for now host I'm not sure if we're even pulling in any data on categories there's a single post t2 let's check our posts no we're not we're not bringing in any categories so let's do that here where's our fragments come on interesting I thought we were pulling these in how are we doing this on those preview because we're not pulling it in there we're pulling it in further up okay so what I'm trying to figure out right now is the best way to pull in category data into our single post page let's see thanks honey for reminding me about the my face blocking the timer so I'm trying to figure out how we're getting the categories for the post previews and would like to do that the same way for the post otherwise I mean we could we could certainly just add it in here to get this but I didn't want to duplicate work if we're already doing it so we're we got no I guess either one of these will work they'll be bringing it get all posts so we are just using get all posts all right then Oh coach I understand nothing huh that's odd I really thought I merged the pool request earlier that was doing oh you know what I ended up not merging it let me double check here yeah we're not it was Sebastian's pool request and I didn't merge it already I let me go back to Sebastian's pull request then let's see let's check these pull requests here I'm gonna grab I'm just gonna grab for now the part of this pull request that that does that actually let me see wouldn't you actually you know what I like this I like this how this is right now let me alright let me say this quickly actually I don't want to commit this part so I'm just gonna commit let me pull over my my terminal so we can see so what I'm going to do is commit what we've done so far and then pull in Sebastian's pull request and then because it looks it looks good now so we might as well just pull that in and then it should make it easier to do what we're trying to do right now so I'm not going to commit the change I made to have an grok work so let's go get add and we're just going to add this views post detail okay if you're not familiar with github basically what we did was we added this file and then once you added is ready to commit we committed it and then we added a commit message then with this git push origin master we sent that change up to the master branch on github now I can merge let's double check and make sure there's no conflicts I'm going to refresh this okay good I didn't think there would be but always get to double check you're gonna merge that great I'm going to leave a great very grateful message alright now let's pull that change in great and yet let me pull this off the page for now let's see okay awesome all right so we have this this is pretty good I'll probably end up messing with the size a little bit but basically this is this is pretty much it so I guess right now if anybody really wants something that would work on something to work on and all I'll make these into issues most likely but the category what I would like is if we click the category it would have the same effect as clicking the category on the side here so that you could easily click it and then go to that category page the category would probably need to be a bit bigger so that it's it's more easily clicked and seen the date looks great I like that with the attachments we might end up doing with the attachments so potentially we might just remove the read more and then if we do that move attachments down to here so they would be below this dividing line probably decrease the size of the of attachments here and then this looks fine this looks great the only difference that I have for these right now is the the font color is lighter so it's probably like if we did like an RGB a black color it would have the opacity of 0.5 for that's usually what I do for that that gray color but that's not really a big deal that's just how I did it the last time the way I said oh oh at some point today or tomorrow probably make some some issues for that okay but otherwise really awesome job on that that looks great so now we should be able to see what she'd be able to see what happened here and yes awesome okay I was really hoping that Sebastian did it this way I thought he did so since he added the categories into this post fragment what we're going to be able to do since we're using what we're not using the fragment here we aren't okay I thought we were already using the fragment for the single post details so let's see if we can work this fragment in into this okay so let's see will impose the state of this fragment let me make sure we can do this ah you know what maybe we don't have this edges we don't have to deal with the edges node for a single post okay no worries it still makes it a heck of a lot easier because now I can just copy this and put that right down here and actually while we're in here let's get rid of the author since we're not going to be using that and let's see me tell you what date okay just checking to see if we could get rid of anything else while we're in here I do want to grab this slug do I want this load I don't think I need this look no I don't what I'd like to do is change these I accidentally all right this is fine so it's hard to see probably on your screen but right now the post still has this ID which is just you know a lot of nonsense ready to us you know just a random string but what I would like to have is the post slug here just like we did for the categories so if you remember so category has the slug which looks a lot nicer so that's what I'd like to do for the posts as well so should be too difficult because we've already done it once for categories but we will need to switch up a little bit about how we're getting that so I'm not going to do that right now but that that is coming okay great so now we should be able to grab the category so while potentially you could have more than one category and WordPress on a single post I am setting the limit at one category for our content managers so we'll never have to worry about more than one category here but let's go ahead and check out our post preview and let's bring in we're just going to bring over exactly the same way we're doing in a post preview we're gonna copy and paste that over and then we can adjust it accordingly there we go bring that in and I think I'm gonna bring over some of these classes now I'm sorry these styles I was looking for Const classes but that's not it's in that lorry we're getting it from okay let me doublecheck yeah alright let's bring this in now that way it should work whoa okay we need what's undefined you categories not the fine classes all right let's see we would have what I do oh okay I see these are being passed in as props so I can't just say category in this case it would be you end up being beep Oh starts those categories categories it is that actually let me just see how are we passing this area that's what I wanted okay awesome it's post so we won't need this exactly but it'll be close to that so I'm going to copy this over okay so we don't need node this should work we're also gonna need to bring in whoops miss my posts those preview keeps going away we need to bring in some of these colors and let's see what else bluegray classes in category styles yeah we probably need this huh classes by I don't know why I'm calling this classes right I should be able to just get it like that okay it's kind of what we wanted step in the right direction let's see what I did kind of gory color okay let's see all right Sebastian's explaining what's what's going on here so he says you also have to pass the style as props with styles grids have export to fall West oh okay okay actually can we do this how can we all right how can I add this in and have it work with everything else that's going on I don't think this will work let's try it I feel like we already dealt with this how did we fix this last time okay thanks argit I know we I know I I went through the same thing at some point maybe it was last week yeah which component did we do that in yes we did okay okay cool all right that makes sense as to why I didn't remember the solution because I didn't find it how I found the solution and fixed it in a pull request all right so let's find where that was let's see let's check let's check home category yeah maybe we no longer have that peg component all right okay so I did it wrong let's see Oh all right awesome sorry about that put the the last parentheses in in the wrong spot okay now I can put this back to would not not here over here now I can put this back to what it should have been classes what did I do all right thanks Sebastian for for pasting the everything in there oh okay I see all right thanks Sebastian so if you can't see the live chat right now Sebastian is just coaching me through all of this oops yay all right thank you for all the help uhhuh all right cool it works now so it's amazing how much you forget about a project when you haven't worked on it for a week I've been working mostly on react native huh the last week so works a little bit differently oh that cool my timer went off so it went off a little while ago but I did want to work through that issue before we did questionanswer so let me do a short break and go over some of the live chat and well I guess I'm definitely not going to make it to the optional thing that I had at 3 3 o'clock harsh should ask is there any react native for us there will be there will be more react native I almost was going to do react native in the stream but I just ended up not ended up not doing it ok let's go all right so I I found where I left off Alexander says hey Jessie Alexander thanks for joining us in the last chat and it says newcomer welcome thanks for watching thanks for joining us in the live chat feel free to ask any questions see Ryan says hey there what can I learn all of this Brett says start with Jesse's first project using next Jas this is likely the deep end of the pool jack way beyond says I had the same question thanks for answering it yeah I mean you could you could start there or if you go to any we have four projects right now so if you go to day one of any of the four projects that would be good so if if you didn't want to learn about next chance and start with the first you could probably start with day one of any of the projects that would work also these streams aren't really set up like a tutorial so you may need to if you really want to watch the streams you probably will need to supplement with some other stuff because they'll definitely be some gaps you know we don't go over every detail in every step but you definitely get you know you'll you'll learn some things you know as you go along just just from kind of watching the code and how we figure out problems and things like that and feel free to ask any questions that you have you know while it while I'm streaming I get to all the questions eventually California boy says how long have you been coding about five years I I have a much more indepth explanation of my my coding history on my youtube channel which i think is linked in the description so if you check out my youtube channel there's a video called how I became a frontend developer so check that video out I explain it a lot more but the short answer is like three to five years basically depending on how you really want to define coder so yeah jacobian says is there anyone willing to join study groups I have a lot to catch up on that's actually a great idea so actually at this point I'm super busy with my class and the work and everything so I don't know that I would be that much help in a study group right now but that's a really good idea so if if you are interested in forming some type of study group I definitely I support that and I may be able to help out and be a part of it at some point but definitely not until I finish my class which shouldn't be that much longer I should be finished in November the course in November I also have to give a talk at a conference and I'm gonna have surgery on my wrist so I may not actually be available in November maybe to be more like late December okay brian says it jumps in Internet Explorer 6 also talking about that UI bug ha ha that's a good one I like that it'd be fun to go back and see how the sites we've worked on look in Internet Explorer 6 if they even work at all all right so I tell you what I don't think I want to do a whole nother Pomodoro session but let's let's just start the timer at least so we can have a cutoff point this will be the last session no matter what but what I'd like to do is just style this text a little bit closer to how we want it see how long that takes maybe adjust some of this and make sure that we don't get this big box here so we'll do those few things and and then we'll finish up but I'll answer the rest of the questions in the live chat so let me let me do this and I'm gonna mark where we left off in the chat okay so let's see let's let's just get rid of this right now so we'll just want to conditionally render that image so what's going here and say I guess I'll just copy all this because basically what we want oops that's not what I need what we want isn't this and if we put it here we won't need it and here anymore so if you're not familiar with this this is called let me think it's a short circuit of something I can't remember the exact name of it where's Patrick I haven't seen Patrick in the live chat for a while but I'm pretty sure Patrick told me what the name of this was if somebody knows that let me know but anyway you're shortcircuiting the normal logic that's happening here but basically it's just a shorthand way of saying if posts if there is post featured image then render this so that's what now okay Harshit said it's conditional running yeah it's conditional rendering but when you just do the the and here instead of like a normal little ternary it was it's called something about shortcircuiting but I just can't remember if there's more to it than just saying shortcircuit so anyway basically we're doing the same thing that we were doing in the source but now we're doing it for the entire component for the entire element I guess it's not really a component so that'll get rid of the box so let's just just see what happens there we go okay but if we go to something that has an image it will display it so not bad that was an easy fix let's go back to one without without the image because then the I really want to see the comparison of text size once we change the font size here so I that'll be easier if they're closer together in this case oh that's it all right okay so rook rook has it here this so basically I'm summarizing what rook has just said in the live chat what happened so normally when you have an end right you'd be saying if this is true and whatever else out here is true then do something but basically how it works with an and operator is if the first one is true it never looks for the second value because this is if one or the other is true so it doesn't care what's on the other side right so that's why we can shortcircuit it because in reality right we we're not checking for a second value so this will say well in in a sense I shouldn't say that because if this is false right we we do want to check right but in the case that this is true it'll just automatically render that right does that make sense yeah alright cool so in in booze Matt sorry if I've mispronounced that but in booze Matt says yeah if the expression gets too and while resolving to something fall see it just exits cool it so anyway that's just it's kind of just that a very concise way of writing it and so you'll see that a lot in the different repositories that we've been working on so let's see alright so that works now we need to instead of dangerous you said enter HTML okay how are we gonna do this I'm not sure if we'll be able to use typography here well we can try it out and see let's just try it okay it looks like Sebastian Sebastian and horse should say you can so let's go ahead with that and see tight oh it looks like we can just set innerhtml grades cool so we don't even need that div let's give this I'm not sure what all the type options are but I'm assuming there's a type option for paragraph maybe maybe we should just check since we have the docs open anyway let's check this out typography here we go typography type body okay let's call it body 21 and do we need huh interesting okay so we can put this component really I we want this to be a div really because the content that we're going to get is already going to be formatted with paragraph tags so let's see how this looks mmm okay wait a second he's gonna post preview no nobody's face okay Sebastian says using it in post cream you let's see okay Sebastian is using body to with the gutter bottom okay let's see if 42 makes makes it look different okay I see slightly different look at font size still looks really small to me I'm gonna check to see what the size is here oh yeah 14 pixels yeah I don't like that yeah I definitely want a bigger font size here so we may end up we could change the typography styles for the theme maybe we'll do that okay so it looks like Sebastian says try display one harsh it says try headline okay let's let's at least try those before we start overriding things if you remember in our last project we use material UI but we brought in that responsive font all those that CSS that changed the font size based on media queries I actually really like that so we may bring that in anyway but I do want to see what these look like so let's try what was the first one display one let's try that out okay much bigger yeah I don't I like this size better than the first one but I definitely would want a different color and probably a different font wait let's try this other one who was it headline oh okay that's actually not bad I like that color better again I'm I'm I'm more fond of the thinner font wait that's not bad let's see how that looks also with a something with an image oh actually I think it looks better it looks it better with an image that's not bad okay I think we're going to go with this for now I'm still thinking about checking out the maybe integrating that that font that responsive font into here maybe maybe I could do it in a way that like let's say let's take that body 1 or body 2 and customize that basically override the default styles and instead make it have all the styles that we want from that responsive font that way we don't have to in our components you know add an extra class into each one instead we can just use body I don't know if it's possible to make an additional one like for instance we can make up our own type I'm sure it's possible but I don't know if there's a proper way to do that I don't want to directly edit material UI files for instance like in our node modules folder so anyway but not bad I think this it's not a hundred percent to where I want it I just want to mess I think with font weights and sizes and maybe the coloring just a bit but for now it's not that and I actually I mean at this size of those good it's still you know if we have a large screen like this I still don't like how how long this is so I don't know a margin might not be a bad idea and also I'm not sure about the image like this if I'm gonna have I don't know that I want a huge image that spans this this whole way I think maybe margins are our best bet to handle that because then that way we don't need a big image for it to look okay because I don't think it looks okay like this but I don't think it would look alright if it were just centered and you still had this hanging over the sides I could do with this being perhaps a bit bigger if we if we had some margins on the side but I don't want the text extending beyond it hmm not bad okay all right I think that's that's not bad for for today let's see we have gone over some things so there are some things that aren't issues yet officially in in github but we've gone over them in the stream so if if anybody like to make them an issue or work on them before I get around to officially putting them in to our github repo then feel free to do that and once again I I completely understand none of you are on and under any obligation to help out with this project and I really really appreciate all your time I mean these projects I you know I know it's nice you can build up your your github profile with with some of this work if you know if you're looking to to do some work on you know some real sites that are you know that are gonna go live or in use but I you know I really really appreciate it so I just don't ever want to feel like I once you ought to feel like I expect you to do something I don't I would still do this dream if no one ever contributed anything and it was all me so don't don't feel like I I expect it right but when it happens I'm very very appreciative and I always learn a lot from your code whenever you you submit things okay so I've scrolled back up to our left off in the live chat I'm going to go down and answer any questions so if you're not interested in sticking around for the questionandanswer session I totally understand thanks for watching so far and I should be back tomorrow so hopefully I'll see you then otherwise if you have a little bit of time I'd love if you could hang out for a bit in the live chat ask questions and answer questions because I could definitely use your expertise and helping answer some of these questions all right so let's see oh okay Harshit says he knows the cause of that UI bug says it is due to the display of yaxis scrollbar in the drawer oh okay but says it's but it's not that big of a deal it's only a four to seven pixel shift so the so let's see this this actually makes a lot of sense that I'm not seeing it on a Mac now so let's try to so assuming this we talk about the scrollbar in the drawer Macs and other systems handle scroll bars differently so if you're on a Windows system and it was like this on a Mac you can't see the scrollbar and so you actually scroll on Windows there would be a scrollbar there so I'm assuming that that potentially has something to do with that positioning and then I suppose that when this shows up it oops it changes something maybe it hides the scroll I'm not really sure because I can't see it on Windows right now I can check it out with browser stack later on so I'll check that out I mean you're right Harshit it's not really that big of a deal but if we have time we may as well try to try to figure it out okay harsh it says Jessie don't refer to get as github it will surely create confusion among the newbies yeah you're definitely right so sorry if I if I do that so I don't I don't remember when I said that earlier on it was a while ago when when horseshit brought that up but yeah so for anybody who is new and not familiar with git and github git is a version control system that you can use with or without github so github is a website where people put their git repositories so that you can other people can see them browse them look at the code and easily submit pull requests and in clone repositories so there is a big difference between github and get so if I mess up and say github when I should be saying get please call me out on that so I can correct it and I don't want to confuse anyone okay a few minutes ago when I said if you can't stick around for the chat then you know feel free to go I guess a lot of people took me up on that offer because right after that the viewership just drunk let's see and use this as a lager one hey how's it going thanks for joining us Satya as are you learning react native from Udacity yes I am so the Udacity nano degree takes you through three projects the first project is just basic react with reactor Otto so you choose create react app and react router to do a really basic react app the second project you add in Redux it's a little bit more complex the third project you use react native that's what I'm working on right now and it's an app where you have you can make decks of flashcards and then you can take quizzes based on those flashcards and it gives you a grade on how well you did you can add flash cards to your decks so it's actually going to be somewhat useful I think after I make it I'll teach my kids how to use it and they can use it to help them study of you know for their tests at school let's see okay harsh it says you know Jessie these these are all rappers use higherorder components for passing props let's see I made one in Maya fun ocation blog I'm trying to follow the see if there's anything left okay yeah okay cool yeah hard [ __ ] I haven't really looked into how this particular version of material UI does everything so yeah so I'm not super familiar with what's going on behind the scenes but I'm sure after I use it this is the first project that I ever use it on this this particular version of material UI so sure after I work with it for a little while longer I'll get used to how everything how everything's supposed to work Harshit says start from learn codecademy channel i started from there yeah I'm I'm not sure somebody must have asked about learning react or something like that anyway yeah I definitely recommend that channel as well so that's one of my top channels for learning more about react or JavaScript in particular so the videos a lot of the videos are kind of old but the the basic principles are still really good so that's will Stearns YouTube channel learn code Academy I learned so much with that a couple years ago when I was really trying to learn more about JavaScript I watched a horse that's handled quite a bit Nisar says favour us by react native with expo only no native development for us with Windows OS yeah yeah we're not right now I'm working with Expo and react native we're definitely not going to do native development will stick with JavaScript I'm still learning in JavaScript and want to focus on that so I won't be switching it up with with anything else right now Hubley blake slate he was building a desk let's go that sounds cool I'm building a desk is it a nice desk let's see okay I got to the bow on the live chat Blake's asking about the end rock link so I am gonna pass this in Blake I'm gonna paste this in I mean the end rock link and I'll leave it running for a little while I'll shut it down before I leave today so even if I end the stream you'll be able to check it out for a little while so here's that link cool harsh it says we are happy to contribute is nice get featured in the stream oh cool well I'm glad you're happy and actually I totally forgot about that I guess it is kind of cool to get to get featured on the stream for free code camp so yeah definitely I it anyone that contributes at some point I will thank you on the stream and make I try to make a big deal about it so let's see Blake says yes I'm building at my local woodworking guild they have classes for youth cool says okay I don't need long maybe 20 minutes all right cool yeah but I'll definitely leave that anger out link up for 20 minutes maybe more that's pretty cool that that you're doing some woodworking stuff I I used to be more into building things like doing some construction work and things but I've just been way too busy for it now and after I I tore some ligaments in my wrist I really shouldn't be using it that much so I haven't haven't done much building recently okay issue screenshot oh great so harsh it has taken a screenshot of the issue I'm assuming that this is that UI bug let me take a look at that right now and see if I can put that oh okay great let's see so let me bring this over so here it is so you can see the the logout is is open there and bulletin is right up against there yes so that's definitely definitely not how it should look so you know it's only a very specific case when that would happen okay all right that's cool I'll try to okay and this is actually on a Mac and this this looks like from one of my interesting I wonder why I can't get it to to happen hmm I mean I am in Chrome Canary so I guess but potentially I could try it give it a shot whoa what's going on it's okay something must have been cashed all right since I still can't recreate it oh well I'll figure it out at some point Oh Harshit said it was a loon okay that was weird it it had I did it had on the other side I thought I saw that it had the the icon for for Mac it had the Apple er anyway okay so that makes more sense okay so it's the Apple theme for Linux alright that makes more sense all right cool I should be able to recreate it if I just run it on using browser stack I'll run it on a Windows Windows machine so let's see I think that's it I think I've covered everything in the live chat if I miss your question I apologize so you know you can ask me again the next time I stream or send me a message on Twitter or something and I'd be happy to answer your question you can also write you know put a comment on this video as well I don't think quite as good of a job of getting back to all the comments because that I have a lot of videos it's kind of hard to track it down and especially since there's so many other people contributing this channel sometimes it's hard to sift through the comments on all the other videos so sometimes they get lost and I don't even realize they're there because they get so far down the list before I even get a chance to check so if you've commented on a video and I haven't responded it's probably because that's happened and it's gotten lost you know buried and all the rest of the comments so I'm not purposely ignoring it I probably just never saw it and sometimes I do try to go back but there I actually don't know how many videos I've done I haven't counted so but there are a lot so it's quite a bit to look through so so if you really need to answer to something you know send me a direct message on some form of social media and that's probably the the surest way to get get the answer so all right oh yes I should says is is requesting that I merge PR 39 it'll solve the male issues okay cool I'll check it out I can't guarantee I'll merge PR 39 today because to be honest with you I've already I'm already over my my work time for today so I'm into I don't get paid extra for overtime and I'm into overtime so I'm probably gonna try to leave soon and I just got a text from my wife that I gotta run to the store and pick up a bunch of stuff oh so I'm gonna be a I gotta go to run some errands but tomorrow morning I should be able to I don't I don't have any meetings tomorrow morning so I should be able to get everything merged and then alright awesome so anyway this was a good stream didn't really get in anything too difficult you know just some basic stuff but it was a nice stream and definitely enjoyed you know talking with you all and I should like I said it should be back tomorrow probably around 200 we'll see I'll schedule I'll try to schedule the stream a little bit earlier in the day I know today was somewhat short notice I don't think I got a scheduled until less than an hour before I came on so I'd like to give you a little bit more of notice tomorrow if I can but until then for for everybody celebrating what was that I don't want to mess it up Diwali is that I think that's that's what it was that I really I don't want to mess up the pronunciation but I have it have a great time with that and I will see everyone tomorrow
