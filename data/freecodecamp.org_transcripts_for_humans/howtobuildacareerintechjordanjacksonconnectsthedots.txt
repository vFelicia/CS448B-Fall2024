00:03 - hello everyone and welcome to another
00:06 - episode of connecting the dots this is
00:08 - going to be our last episode for the
00:09 - year so thank you for showing up and
00:11 - hanging out with us today on the show we
00:13 - have jordan jackson jordan thank you so
00:15 - much for taking the time to hang out
00:16 - with us today
00:18 - of course man i love talking to everyone
00:19 - about the journey just because i know
00:21 - what it was like for me so
00:23 - i just love to just spread like what i
00:25 - went through to know like there's a
00:26 - light at the end of the tunnel so
00:28 - absolutely yeah and you know it's been
00:30 - it has been a long year it's uh it's
00:32 - been tough for i know people even even
00:34 - before the pandemic started it was it
00:36 - was getting tough to get into tech and
00:38 - um and so you know i'm really excited to
00:41 - talk to you about your story and and how
00:43 - you've done it um so for those who
00:45 - aren't familiar do you want to let us
00:47 - know what are what are you doing now for
00:49 - work
00:51 - uh currently i'm at twitter as a
00:53 - software engineer am i working in the
00:55 - rehabilitation and remediation team cool
00:58 - so what our team does is for the bad
01:00 - actors on twitter uh we're responsible
01:03 - for educating and remediating those
01:05 - users to kind of educate them on
01:07 - how they're using the platform
01:08 - incorrectly or
01:10 - how they're
01:11 - not uh doing what the terms of service
01:14 - uh what they're what they agreed to when
01:15 - they signed up so
01:17 - we're not charged with that it's pretty
01:18 - it's a pretty broad like problem space
01:20 - so
01:21 - uh we could be working on stuff that
01:23 - suspends people
01:24 - uh so it's like the i guess the
01:26 - remediation part and then uh we're
01:29 - working on like the remediation part
01:30 - later where we can be educating users uh
01:33 - so that they could hopefully not do the
01:35 - same things in the future
01:38 - yeah that's and that's a that's a
01:40 - stressful space to be in like is is that
01:42 - like
01:44 - when you're working in that kind of in
01:45 - that kind of space do you feel
01:48 - like
01:50 - i get i how do how does it feel to work
01:52 - in that space where it's kind of you
01:53 - you're almost kind of thrown into it
01:55 - into a spot where you're working with
01:56 - the
01:57 - the the worst of the bunch right
02:00 - so that's the perfect way to describe it
02:01 - so when i first came to twitter which
02:03 - i'm sure we'll get to i was an intern
02:05 - and then uh i interned on two teams so
02:07 - the first team was more like a library
02:08 - team and the second team was the team
02:10 - that i'm currently on and it was just
02:11 - kind of funny to be like an intern and
02:13 - coming to twitter because like you said
02:14 - you're working on the nastiest content
02:16 - so you'll be like testing and uh you'll
02:19 - be seeing like the actual reports coming
02:21 - in traffic and uh yeah you see some
02:23 - stuff that you probably wouldn't want to
02:25 - see so
02:26 - may have to take like a a second or two
02:28 - to stop looking at it but yes you do see
02:30 - that uh but it it's kind of bad to see
02:33 - the stuff that people post but i mean
02:35 - then you always think like it's the
02:36 - internet so
02:37 - you're going to see some crazy stuff but
02:39 - at the same time i do really love it
02:41 - because i know it is probably one of
02:42 - like the
02:44 - most impactful teams to be on at twitter
02:46 - which is making it like a safer place so
02:48 - i mean so like taking it like
02:50 - hand-in-hand i actually love being on my
02:52 - team
02:52 - yeah yeah i mean and that
02:54 - like that's such a cool thing too
02:56 - because it's the important work right
02:57 - like it's it's not necessarily the
03:00 - the most fun
03:01 - job if you were to list out all the
03:03 - things you want to do every day like
03:05 - dealing with people who are are kind of
03:07 - out for out to
03:09 - wreak a little havoc is maybe not what i
03:11 - put at the top of my list but helping
03:13 - make that
03:15 - safer helping make
03:16 - helping make that platform more you know
03:19 - friendly and accessible to people so
03:20 - that they feel safe on it that's yeah
03:23 - that means a lot and i i think so thank
03:26 - you for
03:27 - does uh i just say like when i first got
03:30 - like into coding and like software
03:32 - everyone would always ask like what do
03:33 - you want to work on
03:35 - or something like that like yeah what
03:37 - are you building uh or even if you're
03:39 - going to companies like what team do you
03:41 - want to be honest like when you first
03:42 - get started i like had no clue of any of
03:45 - that so i got really lucky with getting
03:48 - on a team this in a problem space that i
03:50 - really enjoy being here so yeah you seem
03:52 - like the job description you probably
03:53 - like no way i don't want to deal with
03:55 - like
03:55 - all this hateful stuff all day but uh
03:58 - but yeah working on making it a safer
04:00 - space for people is definitely like i
04:02 - felt a lot of pride
04:04 - absolutely and you should that's that's
04:06 - a really i love that
04:07 - um well cool so so i would love to talk
04:10 - a little bit about um
04:13 - how you got to twitter you you mentioned
04:15 - a little bit you did some internships
04:16 - but i want to go even before that so
04:18 - what were you doing before you were in
04:20 - tech
04:21 - before i was in tech so i guess that
04:23 - would be when i joined the air force
04:25 - when i was i believe 19 and i got sent
04:29 - to california uh funny story about that
04:31 - is from i'm from uh detroit michigan so
04:33 - okay from the other side of the country
04:35 - so uh and when you go to like basic
04:37 - training uh usually everyone has like
04:39 - this what they call their dream sheet
04:41 - where they want to go somewhere in the
04:42 - world like i don't know italy like
04:44 - germany and uh by the time i went to
04:46 - basic training i was just like i just
04:47 - want to go back home
04:51 - you know i'm like i'm still like a
04:52 - teenager i'm just like i want to go back
04:54 - home so i put like all east coast bases
04:56 - on my dream sheet and then i had
04:58 - california and i was just like oh that'd
05:00 - be cool to go to california
05:02 - and i totally didn't think i was going
05:04 - to get it and i ended up getting sent to
05:06 - california
05:07 - so fast forward
05:09 - i'm in california i always knew i wanted
05:11 - to like create like a company one day
05:13 - mostly was just like designing like
05:14 - products and like a sketch pad but i
05:17 - never knew that i would want to start
05:18 - like a tech company or software company
05:20 - so that came as i was at my first base
05:23 - and uh at that time i was like 20 i just
05:26 - used to read like a lot of startup books
05:27 - and vlogs like you know like the lean
05:29 - startup and
05:30 - zero to one just reading everything and
05:32 - pretty much i got to that point where i
05:34 - had ideas i had all the startup
05:36 - knowledge teaching myself about equity
05:38 - and venture capital but i didn't have
05:40 - anyone to build it and so you start
05:41 - looking for like resources who's going
05:43 - to build my idea and you see like oh
05:45 - this could be like 50 000 to make it
05:47 - happen
05:49 - you have to pay them like 60 an hour and
05:51 - i'm like i'm like 21. it was like i
05:54 - can't afford painting on that so
05:56 - i ended up reaching out to a few people
05:58 - just just kind of like running around
06:00 - just shooting my shot like trying to see
06:02 - who would work with me but uh
06:04 - pretty much that ended up
06:06 - uh getting me to the point where i got
06:07 - really frustrated with finding someone
06:09 - to build something for me so
06:10 - uh that was the day i just kind of like
06:12 - gotten that and i was just like you know
06:14 - what if i can't find like a technical
06:15 - co-founder
06:16 - i'm gonna be my own technical co-founder
06:18 - and so
06:19 - that was the thought process that uh how
06:22 - i ended up learning how to code uh which
06:24 - i started doing i believe about three
06:26 - times um it was like the first couple
06:28 - times just like yeah maybe this is not
06:30 - for me
06:31 - yeah
06:32 - i got to the point where i was just like
06:34 - i should learn how to code you learn how
06:36 - to code you don't need a technical
06:37 - co-founder you can build whatever you
06:38 - want you don't have to pay anyone
06:40 - so that was step one to me learn how to
06:42 - code uh then the second step is uh i
06:45 - wasn't too fond of my job in the
06:46 - military i was one of the guys where you
06:48 - just sign up and like i want to leave as
06:50 - soon as possible
06:51 - [Laughter]
06:53 - and they uh they just kind of give you a
06:55 - job
06:56 - so you don't really have like
06:58 - any kind of say so in it so you just get
07:00 - stuck
07:04 - so one thing about the job was that we
07:06 - would have downtime so i was like the
07:08 - airport manager at the base okay so uh
07:11 - if there weren't any planes flying it
07:12 - would be super quiet so i got a lot of
07:15 - coding now while there weren't any
07:17 - flights
07:18 - but for me not liking that job
07:21 - uh that's how i really got serious about
07:22 - coding because i felt like it it just
07:24 - checked out so many boxes for me um
07:26 - because uh being in the military since
07:30 - pretty much since high school
07:31 - uh it was like the only thing i knew
07:33 - like a lot of people in the military are
07:35 - like oh you know like we don't really
07:36 - want to get out because it's really
07:38 - secure so yeah yeah it's kind of like
07:40 - it's just easy to just sign up and just
07:42 - keep going
07:43 - um but i knew i didn't want to stay in i
07:45 - know i wanted to build my own products
07:46 - and know when to start my own tech
07:47 - company one day so
07:49 - uh so coding checked off all of those
07:51 - boxes yeah uh and i also had a daughter
07:54 - uh
07:55 - like maybe i think it was like two years
07:57 - before i got out
07:58 - so it was just like okay need to be my
08:00 - daughter i need to start a company one
08:02 - day i need to make money to take care of
08:04 - my family uh pretty much like all of
08:06 - these boxes and then i was just like man
08:07 - coding kind of like like checks off all
08:10 - of this yeah that was the point where i
08:12 - got like really serious and so
08:15 - uh when i say serious i mean like
08:17 - no video games
08:18 - uh because like i said i've been uh like
08:20 - before we started the call i was telling
08:22 - jason i've been playing cyberpunk and it
08:24 - is not crashing to me but um i used to
08:27 - play video games but at that point i was
08:28 - just like i can't afford to do that i
08:30 - need the code so
08:32 - uh i discovered free code count i'm not
08:34 - i don't even remember how i discovered
08:36 - it
08:36 - but i mean i just love how it's just
08:39 - like laid out like okay like you start
08:41 - here from knowing absolutely nothing and
08:43 - then at the end it's like okay here's
08:45 - this calculator i built with like
08:47 - four different technologies so
08:49 - that was what i really that's what
08:50 - really stuck me on free code cam and
08:52 - yeah
08:53 - i just was kind of relentless uh from
08:55 - that point and i just if i had free time
08:57 - at work or at home i was coding so
09:00 - um that that is like from like a to to
09:04 - be how i got into like coding like from
09:07 - the start yeah i started it my
09:10 - daughter's name a lot of news but so
09:12 - that's that's actually kind of a really
09:14 - interesting thing like something that
09:15 - that i found fascinating about that is
09:18 - you said that you had downtime at work
09:20 - right and um
09:22 - this is interesting because i i ended up
09:24 - doing the same thing and i hadn't really
09:26 - thought too much about it but i worked
09:28 - at a hotel as a night audit clerk for
09:31 - for a long time and
09:33 - that meant that my job was like if
09:36 - nobody came to the desk which most
09:37 - nights nobody would i had like 45
09:39 - minutes of work to run an audit at 3 am
09:42 - and otherwise i just did whatever i
09:43 - wanted so i got to do all of this coding
09:45 - work
09:47 - as like on the clock for my other job
09:49 - and you got to do the same thing as a as
09:51 - an airport manager
09:53 - how
09:53 - how much do you think that like
09:56 - factored in to your ability to stick
09:58 - with it
10:00 - uh so i feel like it was kind of it was
10:02 - too low so uh so one we were on twelves
10:04 - for a good amount of the time so okay
10:07 - we were there a lot so oh so people when
10:09 - you're on like 12-hour shifts we'll have
10:11 - like maybe three to four of them but it
10:14 - would be like you work your 12 hours you
10:15 - get home you have enough time to get
10:17 - ready for bed and wake up and go back so
10:20 - so it was kind of like sometimes it felt
10:22 - like that was the only time i did have
10:24 - but i feel like it factored in a lot and
10:26 - uh from that like you said with my job
10:29 - it's like once the pilots would finish
10:30 - flying for the night uh i might have
10:33 - like a five hour gap so
10:36 - i mean it's like a lot of people you can
10:37 - watch youtube don't you do a crossword
10:39 - puzzle sudoku but i was like man this is
10:41 - like gold uh you can get paid yeah learn
10:44 - a different job and then uh also like i
10:46 - said i really really didn't like my job
10:48 - so
10:49 - it was like what better thing to do at a
10:51 - job you don't like than to
10:53 - study for a better job yeah
10:55 - so that was probably not only is that
10:58 - when i got the most time to code uh it
11:00 - was probably when i did my best coding
11:01 - because i was just like i gotta get out
11:03 - of here i gotta get out of here so uh
11:04 - just because i know it's not where i
11:06 - wanted to be so
11:07 - i said it was like two parts to it so i
11:10 - feel like it was a huge factor uh and
11:12 - that's also what i tell a lot of people
11:14 - that i try to get into it um i always
11:16 - like to tell people that i feel like
11:17 - anyone could code but you need like a
11:19 - motivator so that was my
11:22 - i was at work which i knew i didn't like
11:24 - being at work uh it was very motivating
11:26 - for me to like just go hard the whole
11:28 - time i was there it's like i'm not doing
11:29 - anything i need to be working
11:32 - so yeah
11:34 - yeah man that that is that that hits
11:36 - close to home for me because i i felt
11:38 - the same way you know i had jobs that i
11:40 - didn't like and i never found something
11:42 - that felt right and my my motivator was
11:44 - always
11:45 - to
11:46 - get something that i liked and so like
11:49 - learning the code was i saw that as a
11:50 - path out so that that's really cool and
11:52 - and you know this this clearly worked
11:54 - for you right you're you're at twitter
11:56 - now so how did you go from you know you
11:58 - were you were working you were learning
12:00 - code at your other job that you wanted
12:02 - to get out of and you've you've since
12:05 - obviously you're no longer in the
12:07 - military you're now working at twitter
12:09 - how did that journey
12:10 - happen like where how did you kind of
12:12 - get from from learning to having the job
12:16 - so i always say it's like a
12:19 - being at the right place at the right
12:20 - time
12:22 - one of the things when i first got
12:23 - started and i
12:24 - uh i acquired my internet and twitter i
12:27 - almost didn't like to tell the story
12:28 - because i felt like it was it just kind
12:29 - of like seemed like a movie moment
12:32 - and i was just like i mean of course i
12:33 - mean i never thought it would happen to
12:34 - me and someone else would have told me i
12:36 - would have been like oh yeah that's
12:37 - never gonna happen to me but i did but
12:40 - so from those long nights coding and in
12:43 - like my job on the military base
12:46 - uh there will be pilots that will come
12:47 - in all the time and of course we're
12:49 - we're at uh travis surfers base so this
12:52 - is probably like i believe the biggest
12:53 - air force base uh in uh like silicon
12:56 - valley bay area
12:57 - so
12:58 - i feel like a lot of the pilots they
13:00 - like new people like in those circles um
13:03 - so
13:04 - one night i would be coding and i would
13:06 - just come in and talk to the pilots and
13:09 - uh one thing i kind of noticed early on
13:11 - is the whole it's not what you know it's
13:12 - who you know thing so i noticed that
13:14 - networking was like very important so i
13:17 - would just talk to everyone so uh before
13:19 - i was coding i would talk to people
13:20 - about like oh i want to have a business
13:22 - one day uh whether or not it turned into
13:25 - something fruitful i would just talk
13:26 - about it just because it was always on
13:27 - my mind
13:28 - uh so one of the pilots uh he came here
13:31 - one night and we were just talking about
13:32 - code and stuff and we mentioned
13:33 - something about uh like the twitter
13:35 - blackburners or something and that's
13:37 - like the employee research group for uh
13:39 - for black people and uh he just said
13:42 - like he knew one of them i was just like
13:43 - oh what are the chances of that
13:46 - so
13:46 - he said he knew someone there was a
13:48 - black bird and i was just like oh you
13:49 - know can you introduce me to this person
13:52 - so you know just totally just uh making
13:55 - conversation and he was like sure so uh
13:57 - he ended up uh introducing me to this
13:59 - person and uh she was awesome we ended
14:02 - up like just making like this this bond
14:05 - brother sister bond over like i would
14:07 - say the course of maybe like 12 to 18
14:09 - months i would say okay
14:11 - this whole time i'm always talking to
14:13 - her just
14:14 - letting her know how my progress is
14:15 - going
14:16 - uh telling her she has to save me from
14:18 - this job
14:18 - [Laughter]
14:20 - and stuff like that
14:21 - um and just kind of just telling her
14:23 - like my goals and like okay i learned
14:25 - how to do this and uh this whole time
14:27 - she's like we never had like a like a
14:30 - formal like plan um it was more of just
14:32 - she was just telling me about the
14:34 - opportunities that were out there
14:35 - uh so i just kept in contact with her
14:38 - and so i just kept coding and coding and
14:40 - then eventually
14:41 - we get to the point where i'm like on
14:43 - the last couple months of like my my
14:46 - listening
14:47 - and uh like you have to go to this class
14:49 - where they they uh try to get you ready
14:51 - to get a job as a civilian and i'm just
14:54 - like man i don't want a regular job you
14:55 - know like i want to be an engineer
14:58 - and so eventually she just
15:00 - approached me and she was just like
15:02 - uh okay i have this plan um if you can
15:05 - pass an interview i can get you an
15:07 - internship at twitter and so uh
15:10 - like what like i'm like this is crazy so
15:12 - uh like first uh twitter doesn't have
15:14 - like a program like this now we do which
15:17 - is actually pretty funny now we do
15:18 - actually have a apprenticeship program
15:21 - where if you're a person you come from
15:22 - like a non-traditional background you
15:24 - can come into twitter as an apprentice
15:26 - and uh actually become a full-time
15:29 - software engineer but at this time it
15:31 - was just like you had to go to college
15:33 - um
15:34 - it was really like a
15:36 - like this is for you
15:38 - it's like you just passed the interview
15:40 - and i was just like i have to pass the
15:41 - interview so from that point forward i
15:43 - mean i was already pretty focused
15:46 - so i ended up having some mentors just
15:48 - teach me
15:49 - uh all of the sorts that i'm pretty sure
15:51 - we got like the merge sorts and bubble
15:53 - swords and
15:54 - every uh i think i did interview cake uh
15:57 - oh yeah yeah i was doing like everything
15:59 - i could a hacker rank i was doing as
16:01 - many hacker ranks as i could um because
16:03 - i just i really really wanted it was
16:05 - just like man this is my shot if i like
16:07 - if i fumble this this is like going to
16:09 - be the worst uh fumble in history or at
16:11 - least for my life yeah well
16:13 - there's actually a question from the
16:15 - chat oliver is asking um
16:17 - so you tackled the coding interviews by
16:19 - doing hacker rank interview cake things
16:20 - like that how was the the coding
16:23 - interview at twitter uh it was actually
16:25 - easier than i thought um i it was so it
16:28 - was for intern of course it was an
16:29 - intern
16:31 - so i mean i guess that's where uh
16:33 - like i said it's for students that just
16:35 - completed their bachelor's so i'm not
16:37 - sure like how that ranks uh for like a
16:39 - like another
16:41 - junior engineer but for me i feel like
16:42 - it was pretty it was pretty simple uh
16:45 - they did hit me with a question the
16:46 - interview was pretty funny because like
16:47 - i said i feel like i prepared a lot but
16:51 - um with these engineering interviews
16:54 - i feel like i don't really have a good
16:55 - analogy off the top of my head but
16:58 - i feel like you could prepare for like
16:59 - 99 of the problems but somebody hit you
17:02 - with that one question
17:04 - you like never just you never got that
17:07 - far to study that it just it could be
17:09 - like detrimental so i felt like i did
17:11 - really good with my interview
17:14 - one of the questions
17:16 - i remember
17:17 - uh was like if you have like a stack
17:19 - you're putting numbers on the stack how
17:21 - do you access the highest number in the
17:24 - stack in constant time um so that was
17:26 - one of the questions i had
17:27 - uh so i i definitely like had something
17:30 - like that before so i was able to solve
17:32 - that
17:33 - and then uh the other question that i
17:36 - got that i'll never forget because i
17:38 - knew i couldn't solve this problem
17:39 - beforehand and like i said it was just
17:42 - like uh please not this question
17:46 - so uh it was the one it's like uh if you
17:48 - have like a a n by n matrix or something
17:51 - okay or and by a matrix uh like how do
17:54 - you get from like the top left corner to
17:56 - the bottom right corner and i think it
17:58 - also includes like the just some spaces
18:00 - you can't go
18:01 - oh okay like yeah i just like admitted
18:04 - i'm terrible with uh matrices like when
18:06 - it comes to code like i do not like
18:08 - trying to traverse like the matrix like
18:10 - with the code um so that was a question
18:13 - i got and uh i did good on all the other
18:16 - questions but when i got that question
18:18 - it like it felt like someone could pull
18:20 - it up like a stake and i was just like
18:21 - man this is it
18:22 - but so so when you got that question you
18:24 - just told them you know like this is the
18:26 - you just kind of you're like look this i
18:28 - this isn't for me
18:29 - yes so yeah they definitely so like i
18:31 - said it was a unique situation so they
18:33 - were like okay we're not uh i mean
18:35 - everyone at twitter they were kind of
18:36 - like it was a new process because like
18:38 - oh we never interviewed someone right
18:40 - but you know you didn't go to college
18:41 - for computer science so i was like we
18:43 - don't know what you learned um so she
18:44 - just kind of uh she was nice enough to
18:46 - like kind of gauge like where i was at
18:48 - so she asked me that question and i was
18:50 - just like i think i pretty much just
18:51 - thought i was like
18:52 - uh i think i tried person i'm just like
18:54 - yeah i can solve this and uh she ended
18:56 - up making like a
18:57 - taking me like to a simpler version of
19:00 - the problem that i was able to say oh
19:01 - nice i started building my way up to uh
19:04 - like almost solving the the one that i
19:07 - couldn't solve in the first place that's
19:09 - cool
19:10 - so yeah so it was like i mean um that's
19:12 - one thing that it's not all about
19:14 - solving a problem uh it's about like
19:16 - kind of like seeing how you could
19:17 - collaborate and work through learning
19:19 - the problem so so yeah we had really
19:21 - great communication and i was just like
19:23 - yeah guess all that and it's okay let's
19:24 - see what you can solve and work up to
19:26 - that so you know overall it was a good
19:29 - result but still stake to the heart
19:32 - you bring up a really good point though
19:33 - which is like i actually think
19:36 - that
19:37 - at least for me one of the things that
19:38 - i'm looking for when i'm interviewing is
19:41 - someone's
19:42 - self-awareness and their willingness to
19:44 - ask for help and so if if i was
19:47 - interviewing someone and i asked him a
19:48 - question they didn't know the answer to
19:50 - if they were to kind of close down and
19:53 - get frustrated and and try to solve and
19:55 - not ask for help to me that's kind of a
19:58 - that's a sign that it's not going to
19:59 - work out right i'm looking i'm looking
20:01 - for what you did i'm looking for someone
20:03 - to say
20:04 - you know i haven't done this before i
20:06 - i'm not sure if i was going to start i'd
20:07 - start like this but i don't really know
20:08 - where to go from there and then you know
20:10 - what you have the conversation how do
20:11 - you think about code how do you how were
20:13 - you were going to approach solving this
20:15 - problem
20:16 - because in a real job you're not going
20:18 - to be solving and like traverse and n by
20:20 - n matrix
20:21 - yeah
20:22 - right
20:23 - never seen a matrix since yeah exactly
20:25 - right so i'm not really interested in
20:26 - whether or not you memorized how to
20:28 - traverse a matrix i'm i'm interested in
20:30 - how you would approach solving that
20:31 - problem
20:32 - um because like i don't think i can
20:34 - solve that problem like i don't work
20:36 - with matrices ever
20:38 - it's a couple problems like that where
20:40 - it's like i don't ever i don't ever want
20:42 - to leave twitter because i'm just like
20:43 - if i get one of these problems i'm just
20:44 - like
20:45 - [Laughter]
20:46 - i'm going back to my office uh the other
20:48 - one is like i don't know it's like find
20:50 - the
20:50 - the large the largest
20:52 - set of increasing numbers in like a
20:55 - a set of numbers and it's just like yeah
20:57 - i couldn't i think i've seen a solution
20:59 - to that one and i've watched like three
21:00 - videos on it and i'm like i don't get
21:02 - how
21:04 - like a dark knight at this point i'm
21:06 - just like oh yeah i'm gonna just keep my
21:07 - job and i'm not gonna fool them around
21:09 - with these
21:12 - the algorithm problems definitely get me
21:14 - i uh yeah and i like i feel for people
21:16 - who are
21:17 - are trying to get through that because i
21:18 - feel like those algorithm problems are
21:20 - are one of those things it's like taking
21:22 - a test in in school it's you're you're
21:24 - cramming for
21:25 - test taking not really for the job
21:27 - um
21:28 - so actually that's there's a question
21:30 - there which is uh
21:32 - a couple people asked adarsh asked uh
21:34 - how are you staying motivated especially
21:36 - when it's something kind of frustrating
21:37 - so when you were first learning and then
21:39 - uh probably asked like when you're
21:41 - moving on to the next topic uh they they
21:43 - forget the one that they learned before
21:45 - so
21:46 - how when you're learning how do you go
21:48 - about like keeping your motivation up
21:50 - and making sure you retain the stuff
21:52 - that you're learning
21:54 - making sure i retain so is this like in
21:56 - reference to interviewing or like i
21:58 - think
21:59 - i'm always just kind of curious about
22:01 - like learning processes in general so
22:03 - when you when you're going to learn
22:04 - anything whether it's studying for an
22:05 - interview or you just you've got a new
22:07 - problem you want to tackle how would you
22:09 - break down you know not getting
22:10 - frustrated uh and staying motivated to
22:12 - learn it and also making sure that as
22:14 - you're learning it you're retaining the
22:16 - the new information
22:18 - okay so first i would tackle like the
22:20 - the retention part uh so i feel like
22:22 - that's just the easier part for me so i
22:24 - definitely would say that uh when it
22:26 - comes to like learning how to code and
22:27 - learning like the different subjects i
22:29 - don't think i worry about retention at
22:31 - all just because i feel like oh if you
22:34 - do it enough it's gonna like stick and i
22:36 - always like to tell people when they
22:37 - first start learning you don't have to
22:39 - remember everything off the top of your
22:41 - head like we have so many resources
22:44 - available when you're doing your job
22:45 - day-to-day so i like to tell people like
22:47 - that like i stay on google a lot at work
22:50 - so
22:50 - uh so when it comes to retention i don't
22:52 - really feel like you have to retain
22:54 - every bit of knowledge you have
22:56 - uh or every knowledge that you're
22:57 - reading about on a particular topic uh i
22:59 - would say you just need to keep a
23:01 - reference to it so it's not like a being
23:03 - an engineer is not like a closed book
23:04 - test at all
23:06 - like i feel like you you can ask anyone
23:08 - you guys google uh you could probably
23:10 - ask jason if he has time you guys need
23:12 - yeah yeah
23:13 - fine uh so it's not like a closed book
23:15 - test it's if you
23:17 - if you don't uh remember something if
23:19 - you could remember like i don't know
23:21 - like i remember i was teaching my auntie
23:23 - how to code and i forgot how to do a
23:25 - closing tag in html and like i'm saying
23:27 - this was probably like a month or two
23:28 - ago
23:31 - in html and i'm just like mass is
23:33 - embarrassing
23:35 - i'm just like i have to google it like
23:36 - to see like how do you close the tag
23:38 - html so
23:39 - that is something i don't feel like i
23:40 - would ever forget but unless you're like
23:42 - working with it every day i don't like
23:45 - you're going to just be like super
23:47 - fluent in it and remember it off the top
23:48 - of your head but i know how to google
23:51 - how do you close the tag in html and i'm
23:54 - like oh i know how to do it now you know
23:56 - i i honestly i feel like that is the
23:58 - most valuable skill that we learn is
23:59 - like i don't think that a a senior
24:02 - developer staff developer is necessarily
24:04 - a better developer than anyone else i
24:07 - think they've just learned more of the
24:09 - vocabulary more of the context so they
24:11 - know what to google
24:13 - like if you know if i ask um
24:15 - what i've noticed a lot is that when i'm
24:17 - talking to someone who's just learning
24:20 - they're like i don't know how to solve
24:21 - this and i'm and i'm looking at the
24:23 - problem they're solving i'm saying okay
24:24 - well what would you search and they're
24:25 - like i don't know i don't know what this
24:27 - is called
24:28 - and so the the learning isn't
24:29 - necessarily
24:31 - i don't know how to solve this problem
24:32 - it's i don't even know what to call this
24:35 - problem i don't know where to start
24:36 - looking for a solution and so the more
24:38 - we learn the more we build that
24:40 - vocabulary and that that web where we
24:42 - can say i've seen a problem kind of like
24:44 - this i think this is called
24:46 - matrix traversal or or whatever right
24:48 - and then we know what to google to go
24:50 - figure out how to solve that problem um
24:53 - i would definitely agree with that just
24:54 - like
24:55 - like what problem you're solving but i
24:57 - don't think like trying to retain
24:59 - everything like software is just it's
25:01 - just it's just too vast and i mean yeah
25:03 - i mean it's not also i mean in addition
25:05 - to it being gas it's evolving so it's
25:07 - like there's new stuff coming out and
25:09 - then the stuff you're already working
25:10 - with is still like evolving so it's just
25:13 - memorized everything so it's just good
25:15 - to kind of just keep like a mental map
25:17 - of like okay like i know the gist of it
25:19 - to where i can google for help but uh
25:21 - something that surprised me too when i
25:23 - first got to twitter uh of course this
25:24 - is my first engineering job ever so i'm
25:28 - thinking like okay like i'm just someone
25:30 - to learn how to code on free code camp
25:32 - and i'm here with uh everyone that went
25:34 - to like berkeley and mit and i was like
25:36 - oh god uh
25:38 - thinking everyone would know everything
25:39 - on the top of their head but
25:41 - but it was really refreshing to see like
25:42 - the uh the more senior engineers like
25:45 - and they have like the same questions i
25:47 - do in meetings or uh you ask them for
25:49 - help and
25:50 - like they'll google stuff that you're
25:51 - like wow i don't think he would know
25:52 - that off the top of his head or um like
25:55 - i'm surprised they didn't know that uh i
25:57 - mean so it's not like a like a slight to
25:59 - them it's just like it's competent to
26:00 - know like oh this is what being an
26:02 - engineer is like it's not like you have
26:04 - to
26:04 - know everything it's not like jeopardy
26:06 - where it's just like hey you can't act
26:09 - yeah
26:10 - so it is that is definitely like uh
26:13 - comforting to me to see uh for sure on
26:16 - like access stuff like that and then
26:17 - what was the second part of the question
26:19 - the second part of the question was
26:20 - about staying motivated because a lot of
26:22 - times especially when we're learning
26:24 - things like coding it's it's abstract it
26:27 - can feel like it's a whole lot and we're
26:28 - never going to learn it all which as
26:30 - you've just stated we never will we're
26:31 - never going to learn at all so how do
26:33 - you how do you keep from getting
26:35 - discouraged and keep your motivation up
26:37 - when you're when you're trying to tackle
26:38 - something that's challenging
26:40 - uh so i would
26:42 - i feel like i'm i'm probably gonna be
26:43 - like uh i don't want people to be like
26:45 - me when i was learning
26:47 - so when i was learning like i had a
26:49 - pretty strong motivator which was the
26:50 - military and i didn't
26:52 - like my situation so that was all the
26:55 - motivation i needed i was like hey you
26:56 - don't do this
26:57 - you're going to be stuck here
26:59 - so that was like that was my motivation
27:01 - so uh so i feel like that's kind of it's
27:04 - not like
27:05 - not that it doesn't apply to everyone
27:06 - right so it's like i feel like everyone
27:07 - has to find like a reason that they're
27:09 - coding because like i said i feel like
27:11 - anyone can do it but if you don't have
27:12 - like to keep you motivated i don't feel
27:15 - like uh it's gonna be a lot harder
27:18 - something that i would do differently
27:20 - when i was learning is i took this kind
27:22 - of like siloed approach where i would
27:24 - just uh learn like i'll take my laptop
27:26 - either at work or at home and i'll just
27:28 - learn so i know free code kind of has
27:30 - like the
27:31 - like chats and forums that you can go
27:33 - and ask for help and i was pretty
27:35 - stubborn about it i was just like look
27:37 - if i can't learn this by myself i don't
27:38 - want to learn it and
27:40 - i would spend like hours on a problem
27:42 - like
27:43 - but as long as i could complete it by
27:44 - myself i would uh i would spend the time
27:47 - so i would say definitely learning with
27:49 - others like because i mean like your
27:51 - team you can like keep each other
27:53 - accountable uh kind of keep the momentum
27:55 - going um so i definitely wouldn't
27:57 - suggest learning alone unless you have
28:00 - like a very extreme motivator like i did
28:03 - um and then uh so that was my motivator
28:05 - while i was like in the military but uh
28:07 - now that i'm uh like i'm
28:09 - actually engineering on that twitter now
28:11 - i would say what motivates me is uh just
28:13 - trying to figure out how to be like a
28:15 - better engineer um it wasn't like always
28:18 - the best when i first transitioned it
28:20 - was pretty tough going from like the
28:22 - military background to tech
28:24 - um
28:25 - for a lot of reasons uh mostly like
28:27 - being in the military and being at a
28:29 - tech company or like polar opposites uh
28:33 - so you know i couldn't even have a beard
28:34 - when i was in the military so you know
28:35 - i'm like i get to have a beard i get to
28:37 - say hey to the ceo at lunch you know
28:40 - yeah
28:42 - so it was it was pretty tough at first
28:44 - but i find just trying to figure it out
28:47 - and be like a better engineer is a
28:49 - pretty good motivator for me
28:51 - yeah
28:52 - just because i still feel like sometimes
28:53 - some days i still feel like a puppy uh
28:55 - in the engineering world so so that's a
28:58 - pretty big motivator for me
29:00 - yeah well and it's cool too like i i
29:02 - think there's a threshold that gets
29:03 - crossed like i've i've i've seen this in
29:06 - a lot of folks where when they're first
29:08 - starting to learn to code it feels like
29:11 - it feels like going to math class or it
29:13 - feels like going to you know to an
29:15 - english class where you're breaking down
29:16 - grammar you're you're trying to memorize
29:18 - algorithms you're trying to do stuff
29:19 - that you're like i don't get how any of
29:21 - this is going to work
29:23 - and then there's a threshold you cross
29:25 - where it starts to make sense and you go
29:28 - from having to think really really hard
29:30 - about how anything works to where you
29:32 - can kind of
29:34 - just you can just write a little bit of
29:35 - code and you can start to build things
29:38 - and when you move from that like i have
29:40 - to struggle to remember how the syntax
29:42 - works
29:43 - to
29:44 - i know the syntax now i can just kind of
29:46 - do that by feel and and i can just build
29:48 - the thing that i want to build
29:50 - that's where i've started to see a lot
29:51 - of you know there's momentum and there's
29:53 - motivation because now you're not
29:55 - it's not frustrating or as frustrating
29:57 - you're you're now able to like create
29:59 - something and as soon as you get to that
30:01 - point where you can create it's like oh
30:03 - now what else could i create what else
30:05 - could i make and and you it creates like
30:08 - a positive feedback loop where you you
30:10 - get to see yourself succeed and each one
30:12 - of those successes gives you more
30:14 - motivation to try the next thing um and
30:17 - i i love you know it's but it's also
30:19 - hard because you got to push that
30:20 - boulder up that hill to get the momentum
30:22 - like you've got to cross that threshold
30:24 - yeah so i try to trust me i try to get
30:26 - almost everyone i know to code yeah my
30:28 - wife she's been batting me away for
30:30 - years at this point
30:33 - but i always tell people whenever you
30:35 - get started you just have to trust the
30:37 - process uh if you get started on pre-co
30:39 - count it's gonna look like gibberish uh
30:41 - of course but i would say when i started
30:43 - when i got serious on pre-code count i
30:45 - would say it was maybe it could have
30:47 - been more than
30:48 - like a few weeks to where i would like
30:51 - stand back from the screen i'd be like
30:52 - whoa like i'm actually writing this like
30:54 - this is pretty crazy um so there's
30:56 - definitely like a point you'll get to
30:58 - where you can see the growth like you'll
30:59 - see yourself writing stuff and you'll be
31:01 - like uh two weeks ago this would have
31:03 - this would have never made any sense
31:04 - this was like
31:06 - like you wouldn't even know it would
31:07 - look like alien uh code or something
31:09 - like that but
31:10 - uh so i definitely like uh agree uh and
31:13 - then also i like to compare uh coding to
31:15 - english it's like i feel like when
31:17 - people say i can't learn how to code
31:18 - it's too hard i was like what if you
31:20 - would have said like oh i can't learn
31:21 - english it's too hard like you're a baby
31:23 - like you just i'm not gonna try uh it
31:25 - sounds like gibberish uh i'm never gonna
31:27 - learn how to put uh like the correct
31:29 - grammar and punctuation
31:31 - i'm just going to talk about the baby
31:32 - forever um so uh so that's what that's
31:35 - the analogy i use um when my family or
31:38 - friends tell me coding is too hard i'm
31:39 - just like you speak english right uh i
31:42 - mean apparently i've heard english as
31:43 - one of the harder languages to learn so
31:45 - it is yeah
31:46 - so it's like you can learn english you
31:48 - learn how to code i mean it's not
31:50 - uh it's not that much different you just
31:52 - have to trust yourself that you're gonna
31:54 - by immersion eventually you're gonna
31:56 - start coding so
31:58 - absolutely so like you said when you
32:00 - start pushing the motor you just have to
32:02 - realize i mean this is kind of like a
32:04 - boater that gets smaller as you push it
32:06 - so yep that's just something to keep in
32:08 - mind when you uh first get started yeah
32:11 - yeah that's such a that's such a cool
32:12 - thing um so something i'd love to talk a
32:14 - little bit more about is you you
32:15 - mentioned that like
32:17 - your path into your internship
32:19 - opportunity was was not like an
32:22 - overnight thing this was something that
32:24 - you built over
32:25 - more than a year
32:26 - um and i want to talk a little bit about
32:28 - that because i think that people
32:29 - undervalue this part of getting a job
32:31 - and you already said this but it's it's
32:33 - not what you know it's who you know um
32:36 - and so uh to just recap a little bit you
32:38 - you were working in the airport through
32:40 - a pilot you got connected to somebody
32:42 - who was a part of the blackbirds
32:44 - organization at twitter and
32:47 - you could have stopped there you could
32:48 - have said that's so cool that you know
32:49 - somebody who's a blackbird at twitter
32:51 - and then never said anything right but
32:53 - you asked you were like hey i can i get
32:55 - connected and then after you got
32:57 - connected you kept in touch you updated
33:00 - on progress and you you kept doing the
33:02 - work and showing your work and
33:04 - eventually that led to her doing some
33:06 - work to get you the interview right and
33:08 - so
33:09 - that i think is such a fascinating like
33:12 - it would be so easy to say oh i know a
33:14 - blackbird of twitter and then you just
33:16 - kind of like well right now that's
33:17 - somebody i know on on the internet and
33:20 - like i like their posts sometimes
33:22 - or you can put that work in you can
33:23 - build that network um
33:26 - how have you found
33:28 - networking
33:29 - like obviously in this case it played a
33:31 - huge role but like have you seen it play
33:33 - in other aspects of your life or in
33:35 - other aspects of your career where it's
33:37 - been beneficial like that
33:39 - uh yes definitely not uh so much like
33:42 - definitely not like getting into twitter
33:44 - but there are a few instances i have uh
33:46 - so
33:47 - for example i was on twitter uh i don't
33:49 - even i don't think i even knew how to
33:51 - code at this point right even begun to
33:53 - go but uh it was someone i think he is
33:56 - the i think he may be the cto of
33:58 - coinbase right now
34:00 - uh balaji but he uh he was like he came
34:02 - out with this like bitcoin computer back
34:05 - then uh and
34:07 - i just remember he came up with it and i
34:09 - forgot how old i was but it was like 400
34:11 - and i was just like man you know i can't
34:14 - afford that so
34:15 - i ended up just like i dm'd him or i
34:17 - tweeted at him i was just like oh you
34:19 - know like i actually like a product
34:21 - tester or something and he's like oh um
34:22 - send me an email or something and he
34:24 - ended up sending me one for free um just
34:26 - oh damn with some feedback and uh so at
34:29 - the time i mean
34:30 - uh coming from like never having
34:33 - anything like that happen i'm just like
34:34 - wow i got this free it was like a
34:36 - raspberry pi but they were selling them
34:37 - for like 400 because they had bitcoin
34:39 - mining chips in them oh okay yeah uh
34:41 - yeah and he just gave me one free so
34:43 - that was pretty powerful to me just be
34:45 - like hey just tweeting i can get like
34:47 - free stuff
34:48 - uh
34:49 - sounds like my first taste of like oh
34:50 - wow you just like talk to the right
34:52 - person
34:53 - they could make things happen for you
34:57 - another thing is i had reached out to
34:59 - someone and they got me like a it wasn't
35:01 - like an internship it was more like a it
35:04 - was a startup and uh they were i forgot
35:07 - the name of it but uh they were doing
35:09 - like um problem solving like they would
35:11 - take problems from like companies and
35:13 - come up with like solutions and
35:15 - uh i ended up like doing like a i
35:17 - wouldn't say like an internship but i
35:19 - was like building like a dashboard for
35:21 - them okay
35:22 - it was probably like the first the first
35:24 - world stacked app i ever built and they
35:26 - were paying me like uh like 500 bucks
35:29 - like a month or something like that but
35:31 - it was kind of crazy because i was just
35:32 - like what um it was like i guess you can
35:34 - say that was the first time i got paid
35:35 - for coding
35:37 - but uh but again i was like a connection
35:39 - i made on twitter where i was just
35:41 - reaching out to people like hey you know
35:42 - like this is what i'm trying to do this
35:44 - is what i'm interested in uh do you know
35:46 - anybody that could help so
35:48 - it's just like you never know like who
35:50 - you're talking to or
35:51 - uh like what they know who they know
35:53 - what they can what they have access to
35:55 - um and that works both ways because i
35:57 - met some
35:58 - people that were pretty uh
36:00 - like
36:01 - i call them lumberjacks because i feel
36:03 - like they chop your dreams down but
36:08 - i met a few lumberjacks you know so the
36:10 - lumberjacks they can be people that are
36:13 - in great positions too but
36:15 - they may not just see things like you
36:16 - see them so you have to stay away from
36:18 - them yeah
36:19 - but yeah so i just found just talking to
36:21 - people
36:22 - and then like i said i mean don't force
36:24 - it but i feel like it just actually
36:26 - comes out like if you're coding all the
36:27 - time or you're trying to make a company
36:29 - i feel like it's on your mind so you
36:31 - start talking to anybody like in a
36:33 - coffee shop or
36:34 - um online like you're just gonna
36:36 - naturally just like hey this is kind of
36:38 - what i'm into and what i'm working on
36:41 - um so so those are two times where i got
36:44 - like a huge example of like hey you talk
36:46 - to people
36:47 - tell them what you're interested in and
36:49 - like hey i mean people i mean a lot of
36:51 - people say this people want to see you
36:53 - succeed like i mean it's like all they
36:54 - have to do is make like an intro and you
36:57 - know like i can have like what i
36:59 - consider like i feel like i'm living in
37:00 - an alternate reality
37:02 - i say that a lot like uh not on twitter
37:05 - i feel like i'm like i just i should
37:07 - still be in the military right now but
37:08 - it's like i put the work in and met some
37:11 - cool people and you know i'm with a
37:13 - better version of my life so
37:15 - uh so so if you can live a better
37:16 - version of your life and also have to do
37:18 - is
37:19 - uh make an intro people will do it i
37:21 - feel like like a lot of people will do
37:23 - that so
37:25 - speaking as as someone who's had the
37:27 - opportunity to make a couple of those
37:28 - intros nothing feels better than being
37:32 - the person who can help
37:33 - you know if i have a friend who's
37:35 - looking to hire and i have someone who's
37:37 - looking for a job and i can put them
37:39 - together and like everybody ends up
37:41 - happy i feel amazing like nothing feels
37:44 - better than being able to help two
37:45 - people solve a problem and you know to
37:48 - so when when we're talking about like
37:52 - make yourself available to people show
37:54 - people what you're doing that's not
37:56 - that's not selfish you are you are being
37:58 - just as good a member of the community
38:00 - by letting people know that you
38:02 - are looking for work what kind of work
38:03 - you're looking for what your strengths
38:05 - are
38:06 - like if i see that and i see that you're
38:08 - looking i have a bunch of friends who
38:10 - work in tech who are always like hey do
38:11 - you know a good like distributed systems
38:13 - engineer hey do you know a good like
38:15 - senior node engineer if i can see people
38:17 - in my network who are doing that work
38:19 - and looking i'm 100 going to connect
38:21 - them every time but if i don't know what
38:23 - you're working on i don't know what
38:24 - you're interested in i'm not just going
38:25 - to like haphazardly recommend you for a
38:27 - job so you're you're doing everyone a
38:30 - favor when you do that like i yeah i
38:32 - cannot stress that enough like how
38:35 - helpful it is to me
38:37 - yeah i have a funny fact i'd like to say
38:38 - that uh i mean it sounds so
38:42 - insane when i say it out loud but uh
38:45 - when i got out the military i only put
38:46 - in one job application
38:48 - oh man that is wild
38:50 - and that was the twitter so uh yeah i
38:53 - had a uh my daughter was one at the time
38:56 - and a lot of people like to go like to
38:59 - this thing called tax where like i said
39:00 - they teach you how to get a job when you
39:02 - get out and help make your resume and um
39:05 - it's like i put in one application uh
39:08 - and i'm just still like blown away like
39:10 - man i was really confident
39:13 - but like i said i was really going hard
39:14 - studying and everything for my uh
39:16 - for my interview so so yes i was like uh
39:19 - i mean i was just telling myself like
39:22 - like failure is just not an option here
39:25 - i mean i like that though like i think
39:27 - there's something to be said for for
39:28 - going all in on a plan um i that was
39:31 - that was sort of a thing that i did as
39:33 - well i i got exactly enough freelance
39:35 - work that i wouldn't like get kicked out
39:37 - of my house like i had enough to clear
39:39 - rent and i was like whatever i'll eat
39:40 - ramen i'm going all in on being a
39:42 - software engineer and i quit my day job
39:44 - and i like immediately that that
39:47 - confidence that i felt when i quit
39:49 - like i had a rough couple of months
39:51 - where i did i cleared rent and that was
39:54 - just about it i ate a lot of like cup
39:55 - noodles but
39:56 - man i was i was an engineer like it felt
40:00 - real and that let me land more clients
40:02 - that let me like go all in on this job
40:04 - and that's led to me being where i am
40:06 - now and so i love i love when somebody
40:09 - bets on themselves
40:10 - like it's it's one of my favorite things
40:12 - to see put all the eggs in one basket so
40:14 - that was but yeah like i said i had
40:16 - built that relationship for 18 months
40:18 - and then when it came to the interview
40:20 - like i was i think i was doing like
40:22 - maybe every other day like uh video
40:24 - calls like with uh
40:26 - here who's helping me
40:28 - uh she's helping me learn like
40:29 - algorithms and the sorts and stuff
40:31 - oh so you had like an interview coach
40:33 - yeah so i didn't have an interview
40:35 - that's good i guess i left a part of my
40:37 - story out uh so
40:39 - when i when the pilot made the intro to
40:42 - the uh lady at twitter i ended up going
40:44 - there for the first time and i just went
40:46 - to the hq and just met her um and
40:49 - that was uh i met like a few engineers
40:51 - also when i met like the first few
40:53 - engineers i've ever met
40:55 - and um like a couple of those people i
40:56 - just kept in contact with them so
40:59 - uh like yeah one of them were they were
41:01 - my interview coach so when i twitter was
41:03 - my interview coach that's really nice
41:05 - but yeah so i would go up there almost
41:06 - every chance i can get um i think i live
41:09 - where i lived it was maybe like an hour
41:11 - and a half from the uh sf hq
41:14 - um so it was kind of a hike but i mean
41:16 - it was so cool like that was one of the
41:18 - the biggest things that was a big
41:20 - motivator too so uh anyone could get i
41:23 - mean when the world opens back up you
41:25 - can get like a tour of like a tech
41:26 - company i feel like that's pretty
41:28 - motivating too um
41:30 - from the military with our working
41:31 - conditions uh not saying like they're
41:33 - like the worst in the world but compared
41:35 - to like a tech company
41:38 - yeah the twitter hq like they're getting
41:40 - uh like we were getting like breakfast
41:42 - every day much every day it's like four
41:44 - cafeterias you got these snack
41:46 - kitchenettes everywhere you got famous
41:48 - people that'll visit us
41:50 - um
41:51 - uh you get to see jack walking around
41:53 - which still
41:54 - my mind
41:55 - uh like it was just uh like a whole it's
41:57 - a whole different way everyone's wearing
41:59 - clothes that they want to wear uh you
42:01 - can have facial hair
42:04 - it was just like a felt like a different
42:06 - planet i mean some places it won't be
42:07 - that extreme right military tech company
42:10 - is like the most extreme i think you can
42:12 - get so i was like blown away like yeah i
42:15 - had like people are working here and i'm
42:17 - like on twelves um so
42:20 - that definitely like just kind of uh
42:22 - helped my motivation piece um yeah
42:26 - then that's actually kind of interesting
42:27 - too because when you when you made that
42:30 - that tour
42:32 - um
42:33 - and like you started keeping contact
42:34 - with with engineers that worked at
42:36 - twitter you had the interview coach did
42:38 - you feel like like at that moment you
42:41 - kind of
42:42 - started to believe it was possible for
42:44 - you
42:45 - uh like like possible to work at twitter
42:48 - well just like possible to
42:50 - have that career to be an engineer to do
42:52 - the things that you wanted to do
42:53 - um
42:55 - that's a good question i don't i mean it
42:57 - kind of sounds like did i feel like i
42:58 - was ready uh
43:00 - well
43:01 - i actually mean it in a different way so
43:03 - so there's um
43:05 - the the way that i mean it is like i i
43:07 - feel like we have a tendency to
43:10 - sort of put ourselves into into
43:12 - whichever box
43:14 - we
43:15 - surround ourselves with right so like if
43:17 - if i'm surrounded by people who think
43:18 - that you know like when i was younger a
43:21 - lot of my friends they all worked in
43:23 - like warehouses construction things like
43:25 - that and they all just kind of had
43:27 - assumed that was as far as they were
43:28 - gonna go and so a lot of my mindset was
43:30 - the same i was like oh yeah i'll
43:31 - probably just like you know build houses
43:32 - or something um and then when i when i
43:35 - started hanging out with people who
43:36 - thought that more was possible i was
43:38 - like wait i could do more
43:39 - i couldn't do more couldn't i and then i
43:41 - started dreaming bigger and and so i'm
43:42 - kind of wondering like
43:44 - it sounds like you already had big
43:45 - dreams like so i'm not saying you know
43:47 - like
43:47 - the the getting an intro was there but
43:49 - like where did you find that threshold
43:51 - really was crossed for you where you you
43:53 - started to really think like you know
43:55 - what this isn't just a dream i'm going
43:56 - to do this
43:57 - uh so like you said i do think i always
44:00 - like kind of thought big like i wanted
44:01 - to have my own company i didn't think it
44:03 - would be like software or building uh
44:05 - like an app or anything like that but
44:07 - i did get to a point in the military
44:09 - where like you said it was exactly like
44:11 - what you just said in the military uh
44:13 - you retire after doing 20 years of
44:15 - service so a lot of people i mean that's
44:17 - like oh you can get a retirement check
44:18 - every 20 years so you'll meet a lot of
44:20 - people did that's what they want to do
44:22 - they want to do their 20 years and get
44:23 - out um and that wasn't my intentions
44:25 - when i came in like i had a six-year
44:26 - contract should have been four but i was
44:28 - 19 so gotta forgive myself
44:32 - but uh i came in and so now i'm
44:34 - surrounded by all of these people that
44:35 - just they want to do 20 years uh and i'm
44:38 - just like you know i don't want to do 20
44:40 - years i mean i didn't know what i wanted
44:41 - to do so i think that was probably like
44:43 - a like a uh like a hindrance for me like
44:46 - oh i need like a i needed like some
44:48 - direction nevertheless it's easy to be
44:49 - caught up in what everyone else wants to
44:51 - do so there was a point where i was i
44:54 - remember saying to myself i'm going to
44:55 - do 20 years
44:58 - like this is something like i was like
44:59 - no way like this is not what i'm doing
45:02 - and then i remember saying that to
45:03 - myself and uh it was actually uh one of
45:06 - uh we had civilians that we worked with
45:09 - yeah
45:10 - and it was actually one of the civilians
45:12 - uh his name was gary and i would always
45:15 - talk to him because he wanted to uh buy
45:17 - a porsche 911 when he retired okay
45:20 - he was like working on his second
45:21 - retirement when he retired for the
45:23 - second time he wanted a fortune 911.
45:25 - i just always remember that he would uh
45:27 - talk about like yeah my wife's gonna let
45:29 - me get him when i'm retiring so i
45:30 - remember one day i was talking to him
45:31 - and i tell him i was like yeah when i
45:33 - retired from the military and get a
45:34 - porsche like yours you know just just uh
45:37 - joking around and stuff
45:38 - and um like i swear i'll never forget
45:40 - this he said uh he called me jj because
45:42 - we called each other by our initials at
45:43 - work and he was like jj you won't have
45:45 - to say goodbye porsche
45:47 - and i just like no logics and that took
45:50 - me on like a mind trip i was just like
45:52 - what does he mean by that and then it
45:54 - was like at that moment
45:56 - like the old me
45:57 - i want to start a company and build
45:59 - something and like just not settle for
46:02 - just anything i just like woke up and
46:05 - like from that day forward i just been
46:07 - like hey like i'm gonna be the ceo like
46:10 - my own company one day and i don't care
46:11 - what anybody says about it um so from
46:14 - that day forward like i was just like uh
46:16 - and then it also gave me like a pretty
46:18 - strong shield because after that day i
46:20 - kind of just realized like man if you're
46:22 - around like people just putting the
46:23 - wrong things into your head uh you can
46:25 - kind of get like sidetracked from like
46:27 - your dreams and your goals so
46:29 - from that day i would say yes i felt
46:31 - like yes i could be engineered yes i
46:33 - could be the ceo of my own company if i
46:35 - wanted to
46:36 - i could be i could be anything i want to
46:37 - so
46:38 - after
46:39 - like
46:40 - shaking that off
46:42 - uh yes i definitely believed i could
46:44 - whether i was ready is a different
46:46 - question but as far as like the box no
46:49 - boxes i don't do boxes anymore yeah i
46:51 - love that though and and like who's
46:53 - who's ever ready like i i honestly if
46:55 - you told me i was going to interview a
46:56 - twitter tomorrow i don't know i'd
46:58 - probably bomb it i definitely bombed it
47:00 - facebook when i interviewed back a while
47:01 - ago
47:05 - but you know i think it's one of those
47:06 - things like i you know i've also since
47:08 - worked at other startups and i i nailed
47:11 - the technical interviews so a lot of it
47:12 - is also on like just taking the chances
47:14 - right like i you know i worked at ibm
47:16 - and my technical interview there was
47:18 - great we like reviewed projects together
47:20 - and like refactored things and it wasn't
47:22 - an algorithm interview facebook i was
47:24 - interviewing for front end and they were
47:25 - like hey do you want to write some sql
47:26 - queries and i was like i don't think i'm
47:28 - interviewing for the right job
47:30 - [Laughter]
47:33 - yeah i write those sometimes at work but
47:35 - i saw i use google like i just
47:40 - uh just enough to get like uh like the
47:42 - data back that uh that's useful for me
47:44 - but by no means am i pro but but yes
47:47 - that's how that is definitely how i feel
47:49 - no no boxes are allowed i can't i can't
47:51 - go back to that i love that interest
47:53 - it's dangerous i mean i wouldn't be i
47:55 - mean if i would have stayed in that box
47:56 - i mean like yes i just i just moved to
47:58 - michigan um because of the pandemic we
48:01 - were allowed to move so i just moved
48:02 - back home
48:03 - um with my uh to be closer to family and
48:05 - stuff and i'm i still have my job and
48:07 - i'm just like wow i work at twitter i
48:09 - live i'm i'm back home
48:12 - you know like i'm seeing my family yeah
48:14 - and i'm just thinking like this would
48:16 - have been
48:17 - non-existent you know if i would have
48:18 - just stayed in that box like oh i mean i
48:21 - think i would be
48:22 - let me say i would have
48:24 - uh 12 years left before i retired
48:27 - dang that i wouldn't have been happy
48:28 - though
48:30 - yeah
48:31 - so so yeah so that's why i said the
48:33 - lumberjacks are just you have to
48:35 - have to stay away from yeah oh man i
48:38 - love that so much that's uh and it's
48:40 - such a heartwarming story like i love i
48:42 - love when you can kind of draw
48:44 - like a point like there's there's a
48:46 - conversation i had that that like
48:48 - realigned me and uh and it sounds like
48:50 - talking to to gary like what a what a
48:53 - cool moment to be able to just be like
48:55 - oh yeah like i almost i almost did a
48:59 - whole different life i could have been
49:00 - somebody completely different dad yeah i
49:03 - don't know so i actually have i think it
49:05 - was that same day it might not have been
49:07 - that same day but he wrote me a sticky
49:09 - note um it says your uh your vision
49:11 - determines your destination
49:13 - and like yeah i still have that sticky
49:15 - note in my closet somewhere i'm gonna
49:16 - frame it
49:18 - but yeah so uh gary he wrote that for me
49:21 - and
49:22 - uh thank you like i said it was around
49:23 - the same time that he told me i wouldn't
49:24 - have to say for a portion i was just
49:26 - like
49:27 - like yeah i just i was just
49:29 - it was crazy it was just like man he
49:31 - sees like
49:32 - he obviously sees who i was and like
49:35 - motivation and the dreams i had when i
49:36 - first got there and for me it was just
49:38 - like i always say i was in a sunken
49:40 - place pretty much
49:41 - yeah yeah i like get out like i'm just
49:44 - like the real me is down there like just
49:45 - no that's not what you want
49:48 - so uh yeah so gary he just i can't
49:51 - remember what they used in a movie but
49:52 - he just woke me up and now she's like
49:54 - what
49:54 - oh yeah so ever since then it's been
49:57 - like nah
49:58 - uh i gotta even if they 99 of startups
50:02 - well i'm like hey
50:04 - uh i have to have to play my hand
50:07 - just to see what it's gonna do so
50:10 - um
50:10 - so yeah that is i never forget that
50:12 - moment yeah
50:14 - no no
50:15 - so i i have a couple a couple more
50:17 - questions before we wrap up um so i want
50:19 - to i want to kind of twist this around
50:21 - we've got a lot of people watching now
50:22 - who are just getting into the industry
50:24 - they're taking free code camp right now
50:26 - they're they're learning um and so i
50:29 - want to just kind of ask you
50:32 - for all the people who are out there
50:33 - trying to get in um like one one
50:35 - specific question is
50:37 - what type of projects did you have in
50:39 - your portfolio and and kind of what
50:41 - would you recommend folks focus on if
50:44 - they're if they're looking to build
50:45 - their own portfolio
50:46 - if they're looking to build their own
50:48 - portfolio so uh when i tell people to
50:50 - learn now i usually just tell them to go
50:52 - through retail camp and build like the
50:53 - portfolio stuff
50:54 - mostly because i feel like that's what
50:56 - gave me a lot of my confidence at first
50:58 - like you feel like
51:00 - i think it was like a simon game
51:02 - like a javascript calculator i feel like
51:04 - all of that is like good stuff and then
51:07 - um some of the other stuff that i love i
51:09 - love to do um and actually i felt like
51:12 - this was probably the best preparation i
51:14 - had uh to for being like an engineer at
51:17 - twitter and that is following projects
51:19 - on youtube so uh it's a guy who
51:22 - watches videos what is his name brad his
51:24 - name's brad uh i forgot his last name is
51:27 - it traversing media yes yeah yeah yeah
51:30 - so i used to watch his videos and he
51:32 - would uh he would go from like zero to
51:34 - like a hundred making like a full
51:37 - full stack project and it would be
51:39 - awesome for a portfolio and not only
51:41 - that but
51:42 - after i was finished watching brad i
51:44 - would go in there and like tinker and
51:45 - like
51:46 - like my own like app you know so um so i
51:49 - mean like you could build it and
51:50 - repurpose it for something and yeah
51:53 - probably like the best experience you're
51:55 - gonna get for
51:56 - uh like to prepare uh to be an engineer
51:59 - at like a big company uh just because
52:02 - something i didn't realize is that when
52:03 - you're a junior engineer you're not
52:05 - going to go into the company building
52:06 - services from scratch
52:08 - right oh i feel like that was a big
52:10 - misconception i had like i'm gonna go in
52:12 - here i'm gonna have to start like i'm
52:14 - gonna have to build like a full stack
52:15 - out but
52:16 - when you get in you realize that you're
52:18 - you're only going to be updating and uh
52:21 - building on existing code like you're
52:23 - not
52:24 - starting up as like a service from
52:25 - scratch like that's mostly like senior
52:27 - work senior level work so i mean if you
52:29 - could come in and do that i mean yeah
52:31 - you're a rock star but yeah
52:34 - that's the bar like i have to come in
52:35 - building like a whole service from
52:37 - scratch so uh the way i link those two
52:39 - is you build like a project from like
52:41 - brad
52:42 - and then uh you tinker with it you make
52:45 - modifications to it you learn how to
52:46 - code works and you'll be well prepared
52:49 - to get into another company where you're
52:51 - going to get thrown into like a super
52:53 - random code base uh you're just going to
52:55 - have to go and do the exact same thing
52:57 - which is learning how it works and
52:59 - learning how to update and extend it um
53:01 - so i would definitely say following
53:03 - those uh those videos online and
53:05 - building them and just uh seeing how
53:07 - they work internally we'll give you like
53:09 - a lot of experience
53:11 - yeah
53:12 - definitely way more than prepare for uh
53:14 - like learning algorithms and stuff like
53:16 - that
53:17 - yeah yeah well i mean it's kind of one
53:19 - of those things it's a it's a little bit
53:20 - of a
53:21 - you got to do both unfortunately
53:24 - right but um but i think to your point
53:27 - that's almost a skill that we forget
53:30 - is that a lot of what we're doing is not
53:33 - inventing new code a lot of what we're
53:34 - doing is i'm going to inherit your code
53:36 - and i have to look at it and understand
53:38 - it and then make it do something mostly
53:40 - the same but a little bit different or i
53:42 - have to patch one small bug i don't get
53:44 - to start from scratch and
53:47 - that interpretation that ability to
53:49 - comprehend somebody else's code that's
53:51 - probably the most valuable skill you can
53:53 - have as someone who's new
53:55 - yes definitely so like you said you do
53:57 - have to learn both which is unfortunate
53:59 - but uh what in terms of actually being
54:02 - on the job and doing work uh yes
54:04 - learning how to inherit code i guess is
54:06 - a good way to say it and learn how to
54:08 - work into your code oh i own this file
54:10 - let me figure out how can i make it more
54:12 - efficient
54:13 - um how do i extend it how do i test it
54:16 - locally and
54:17 - uh how do i review it because you're
54:19 - gonna have to review other people's code
54:21 - there's probably a close proximity to it
54:24 - so like i would definitely say that
54:26 - gives you like a lot of experience so
54:28 - you're going to be building a portfolio
54:29 - you're going to be learning how
54:31 - different technologies work and you're
54:33 - also if you follow the video step by
54:34 - step you're going to be able to look at
54:36 - someone else's code and figure out how
54:37 - it works
54:38 - um which is always not as
54:40 - straightforward as you would like it to
54:41 - be
54:43 - so getting a lot of experience early on
54:46 - would just help you just go like a lot
54:48 - further once you get into your job yeah
54:50 - for sure
54:51 - so uh so one last question before we
54:54 - wrap up uh for all the folks out there
54:56 - who are trying to get their first
54:58 - opportunity and trying to get their foot
55:00 - in the door um you've already talked
55:02 - about you know your your networking your
55:04 - ability to visit the twitter campus
55:06 - what what do you recommend for folks who
55:09 - maybe don't have the opportunity to go
55:11 - to a company's headquarters or to meet
55:13 - people in person especially now that
55:15 - we're in the pandemic
55:16 - how would you recommend
55:18 - trying to get a similar sort of
55:20 - networking going remotely especially you
55:22 - know we've got a lot of folks joining
55:23 - today from india or from other places
55:25 - around the world um
55:27 - how do you think they can they can get
55:29 - that similar sort of connection without
55:30 - the ability to be physically there
55:33 - uh so i don't think uh it needs to be
55:35 - physical like like i said some of the
55:36 - first like networking opportunities uh
55:39 - given they weren't for jobs but uh i
55:41 - feel like it still was like a example of
55:43 - how networking can open doors for you uh
55:46 - we're on twitter so like you don't
55:48 - really need the physical aspect so i
55:50 - actually wrote an article about uh how i
55:53 - started on free code camp ended up
55:54 - interning at twitter all right this
55:56 - article i just talked about from a to b
55:58 - pretty much a lot of the stuff i've said
56:00 - here
56:01 - and i think at the at the end of the
56:03 - article i was just like hey anyone has
56:06 - any questions email me you know people
56:07 - email me to ask questions i mean at this
56:09 - point i'm like full of time on twitter
56:11 - so i mean it's like i'm like hey i could
56:13 - be your connection at twitter i mean i'm
56:14 - not saying i could get you a for sure
56:16 - job but i could introduce you to people
56:18 - i could help you study i could help you
56:19 - learn yeah i'm gonna talk to you about
56:21 - your journey and i would say
56:24 - maybe
56:25 - one or two people email me
56:28 - um and then only one that i talked to to
56:30 - this day and she was just like really
56:33 - really like adamant about it like hey
56:35 - like you know like i have questions for
56:36 - you man like i still keep in contact
56:38 - with her to this day and she uh i forgot
56:40 - the company she's got a job at a company
56:42 - but she's like she's on it like she's
56:44 - reading these articles and people say
56:46 - hit them up she's hitting them up uh
56:48 - because i mean like if you if you're
56:50 - hitting people up i mean if you get like
56:51 - a 10 10
56:53 - rate i mean you hit up 10 people a day
56:55 - some one person is going to talk back to
56:57 - you you know you don't know who that one
56:58 - person is
56:59 - so i definitely i mean if anything in
57:01 - the kind of probably made it easier you
57:02 - just sit in your room and probably get
57:04 - connected with the world
57:06 - well it's also removed that physical
57:08 - advantage that other people might have
57:10 - had like i can't go drop into somebody's
57:12 - office i have to email them too or send
57:13 - them a dm or or whatever yes i mean it's
57:16 - a different like uh like something that
57:18 - i never thought of which one of my good
57:20 - friends helped me realize is that a lot
57:22 - of the social media platforms they're
57:25 - helpful for getting in contact with
57:26 - people absolutely like instagram i've
57:29 - never had instagram i didn't have it for
57:31 - like maybe like five or six years and
57:34 - then one of my friends he was just like
57:35 - you gotta get on instagram you know like
57:36 - there's a lot of tech people and vcs on
57:39 - twitter i mean on uh instagram it's like
57:42 - you can talk to them and it's just like
57:43 - you know they're
57:44 - there and they're like you know like you
57:46 - can go and interact with them and talk
57:48 - to them and they're very influential
57:50 - people uh yeah
57:52 - i mean you could go on twitter uh
57:54 - instagram facebook probably not linkedin
57:56 - because it's just too expected
58:00 - there are a lot of ways to just find
58:02 - people and then they have like the
58:03 - virtual conferences now
58:05 - but uh but i would say the main thing is
58:07 - i mean you just can't be scared like
58:09 - just just throw throw up the emails i
58:11 - mean
58:12 - i'm not saying throw up like a canned
58:13 - email because you don't like that but
58:16 - but if you're reading uh you see like
58:18 - interviews and like i'm like hey you
58:20 - know just reach out i mean it doesn't
58:22 - take that long to respond to the email
58:23 - absolutely
58:25 - um so yeah so yeah like the person i
58:27 - mentioned like
58:29 - uh i forgot i would have to see how many
58:31 - reasons i got on that it was a lot it
58:32 - was
58:33 - i believe it was five figures so tens
58:36 - ten thousand no more people that's not a
58:38 - lot of emails off of
58:40 - yeah so
58:41 - i mean that but that's a good that's a
58:43 - thing like if you're out there thinking
58:44 - that if you take a shot you're gonna be
58:46 - one of hundreds of of people in this
58:48 - person's inbox chances are that's not
58:50 - the case because everybody thinks that
58:52 - everybody thinks that everybody's
58:53 - sending
58:54 - and nobody is like i don't get a lot of
58:56 - emails you're not getting a lot of
58:58 - emails like
58:59 - i don't think that that people are as
59:01 - flooded as you think so i think if you
59:02 - if you reach out and you're in you're
59:04 - genuinely asking not don't spam me for
59:06 - connections but like ask what are you
59:09 - working on what are you stuck on what
59:10 - are you excited about like we want to
59:12 - hear from you that's fun for us that's
59:13 - what we do with our friends right
59:22 - we're at time so um let me let me do
59:25 - this let me where should people go if
59:27 - they want to if they want to keep in
59:29 - touch with you is there a platform you
59:30 - prefer twitter of course

60:15 - you can you can drop that um and then
60:18 - yeah otherwise like thank you so much
60:20 - for being here today um if if you all
60:23 - want to see more of these we've got more
60:24 - connecting the dots on the free code
60:26 - camp youtube there's a series of them
60:28 - they're in a playlist you can you can
60:29 - just search for uh connect the dots on
60:30 - there um

61:24 - this has been a lot of fun man this has
61:26 - been so much fun thank you so much for
61:27 - hanging out jordan thank you to the free
61:28 - code camp team thank you chad for for
61:30 - hanging out with us and we'll see you
61:32 - all next time
61:33 - see ya

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone and welcome to another episode of connecting the dots this is going to be our last episode for the year so thank you for showing up and hanging out with us today on the show we have jordan jackson jordan thank you so much for taking the time to hang out with us today of course man i love talking to everyone about the journey just because i know what it was like for me so i just love to just spread like what i went through to know like there's a light at the end of the tunnel so absolutely yeah and you know it's been it has been a long year it's uh it's been tough for i know people even even before the pandemic started it was it was getting tough to get into tech and um and so you know i'm really excited to talk to you about your story and and how you've done it um so for those who aren't familiar do you want to let us know what are what are you doing now for work uh currently i'm at twitter as a software engineer am i working in the rehabilitation and remediation team cool so what our team does is for the bad actors on twitter uh we're responsible for educating and remediating those users to kind of educate them on how they're using the platform incorrectly or how they're not uh doing what the terms of service uh what they're what they agreed to when they signed up so we're not charged with that it's pretty it's a pretty broad like problem space so uh we could be working on stuff that suspends people uh so it's like the i guess the remediation part and then uh we're working on like the remediation part later where we can be educating users uh so that they could hopefully not do the same things in the future yeah that's and that's a that's a stressful space to be in like is is that like when you're working in that kind of in that kind of space do you feel like i get i how do how does it feel to work in that space where it's kind of you you're almost kind of thrown into it into a spot where you're working with the the the worst of the bunch right so that's the perfect way to describe it so when i first came to twitter which i'm sure we'll get to i was an intern and then uh i interned on two teams so the first team was more like a library team and the second team was the team that i'm currently on and it was just kind of funny to be like an intern and coming to twitter because like you said you're working on the nastiest content so you'll be like testing and uh you'll be seeing like the actual reports coming in traffic and uh yeah you see some stuff that you probably wouldn't want to see so may have to take like a a second or two to stop looking at it but yes you do see that uh but it it's kind of bad to see the stuff that people post but i mean then you always think like it's the internet so you're going to see some crazy stuff but at the same time i do really love it because i know it is probably one of like the most impactful teams to be on at twitter which is making it like a safer place so i mean so like taking it like handinhand i actually love being on my team yeah yeah i mean and that like that's such a cool thing too because it's the important work right like it's it's not necessarily the the most fun job if you were to list out all the things you want to do every day like dealing with people who are are kind of out for out to wreak a little havoc is maybe not what i put at the top of my list but helping make that safer helping make helping make that platform more you know friendly and accessible to people so that they feel safe on it that's yeah that means a lot and i i think so thank you for does uh i just say like when i first got like into coding and like software everyone would always ask like what do you want to work on or something like that like yeah what are you building uh or even if you're going to companies like what team do you want to be honest like when you first get started i like had no clue of any of that so i got really lucky with getting on a team this in a problem space that i really enjoy being here so yeah you seem like the job description you probably like no way i don't want to deal with like all this hateful stuff all day but uh but yeah working on making it a safer space for people is definitely like i felt a lot of pride absolutely and you should that's that's a really i love that um well cool so so i would love to talk a little bit about um how you got to twitter you you mentioned a little bit you did some internships but i want to go even before that so what were you doing before you were in tech before i was in tech so i guess that would be when i joined the air force when i was i believe 19 and i got sent to california uh funny story about that is from i'm from uh detroit michigan so okay from the other side of the country so uh and when you go to like basic training uh usually everyone has like this what they call their dream sheet where they want to go somewhere in the world like i don't know italy like germany and uh by the time i went to basic training i was just like i just want to go back home you know i'm like i'm still like a teenager i'm just like i want to go back home so i put like all east coast bases on my dream sheet and then i had california and i was just like oh that'd be cool to go to california and i totally didn't think i was going to get it and i ended up getting sent to california so fast forward i'm in california i always knew i wanted to like create like a company one day mostly was just like designing like products and like a sketch pad but i never knew that i would want to start like a tech company or software company so that came as i was at my first base and uh at that time i was like 20 i just used to read like a lot of startup books and vlogs like you know like the lean startup and zero to one just reading everything and pretty much i got to that point where i had ideas i had all the startup knowledge teaching myself about equity and venture capital but i didn't have anyone to build it and so you start looking for like resources who's going to build my idea and you see like oh this could be like 50 000 to make it happen you have to pay them like 60 an hour and i'm like i'm like 21. it was like i can't afford painting on that so i ended up reaching out to a few people just just kind of like running around just shooting my shot like trying to see who would work with me but uh pretty much that ended up uh getting me to the point where i got really frustrated with finding someone to build something for me so uh that was the day i just kind of like gotten that and i was just like you know what if i can't find like a technical cofounder i'm gonna be my own technical cofounder and so that was the thought process that uh how i ended up learning how to code uh which i started doing i believe about three times um it was like the first couple times just like yeah maybe this is not for me yeah i got to the point where i was just like i should learn how to code you learn how to code you don't need a technical cofounder you can build whatever you want you don't have to pay anyone so that was step one to me learn how to code uh then the second step is uh i wasn't too fond of my job in the military i was one of the guys where you just sign up and like i want to leave as soon as possible [Laughter] and they uh they just kind of give you a job so you don't really have like any kind of say so in it so you just get stuck so one thing about the job was that we would have downtime so i was like the airport manager at the base okay so uh if there weren't any planes flying it would be super quiet so i got a lot of coding now while there weren't any flights but for me not liking that job uh that's how i really got serious about coding because i felt like it it just checked out so many boxes for me um because uh being in the military since pretty much since high school uh it was like the only thing i knew like a lot of people in the military are like oh you know like we don't really want to get out because it's really secure so yeah yeah it's kind of like it's just easy to just sign up and just keep going um but i knew i didn't want to stay in i know i wanted to build my own products and know when to start my own tech company one day so uh so coding checked off all of those boxes yeah uh and i also had a daughter uh like maybe i think it was like two years before i got out so it was just like okay need to be my daughter i need to start a company one day i need to make money to take care of my family uh pretty much like all of these boxes and then i was just like man coding kind of like like checks off all of this yeah that was the point where i got like really serious and so uh when i say serious i mean like no video games uh because like i said i've been uh like before we started the call i was telling jason i've been playing cyberpunk and it is not crashing to me but um i used to play video games but at that point i was just like i can't afford to do that i need the code so uh i discovered free code count i'm not i don't even remember how i discovered it but i mean i just love how it's just like laid out like okay like you start here from knowing absolutely nothing and then at the end it's like okay here's this calculator i built with like four different technologies so that was what i really that's what really stuck me on free code cam and yeah i just was kind of relentless uh from that point and i just if i had free time at work or at home i was coding so um that that is like from like a to to be how i got into like coding like from the start yeah i started it my daughter's name a lot of news but so that's that's actually kind of a really interesting thing like something that that i found fascinating about that is you said that you had downtime at work right and um this is interesting because i i ended up doing the same thing and i hadn't really thought too much about it but i worked at a hotel as a night audit clerk for for a long time and that meant that my job was like if nobody came to the desk which most nights nobody would i had like 45 minutes of work to run an audit at 3 am and otherwise i just did whatever i wanted so i got to do all of this coding work as like on the clock for my other job and you got to do the same thing as a as an airport manager how how much do you think that like factored in to your ability to stick with it uh so i feel like it was kind of it was too low so uh so one we were on twelves for a good amount of the time so okay we were there a lot so oh so people when you're on like 12hour shifts we'll have like maybe three to four of them but it would be like you work your 12 hours you get home you have enough time to get ready for bed and wake up and go back so so it was kind of like sometimes it felt like that was the only time i did have but i feel like it factored in a lot and uh from that like you said with my job it's like once the pilots would finish flying for the night uh i might have like a five hour gap so i mean it's like a lot of people you can watch youtube don't you do a crossword puzzle sudoku but i was like man this is like gold uh you can get paid yeah learn a different job and then uh also like i said i really really didn't like my job so it was like what better thing to do at a job you don't like than to study for a better job yeah so that was probably not only is that when i got the most time to code uh it was probably when i did my best coding because i was just like i gotta get out of here i gotta get out of here so uh just because i know it's not where i wanted to be so i said it was like two parts to it so i feel like it was a huge factor uh and that's also what i tell a lot of people that i try to get into it um i always like to tell people that i feel like anyone could code but you need like a motivator so that was my i was at work which i knew i didn't like being at work uh it was very motivating for me to like just go hard the whole time i was there it's like i'm not doing anything i need to be working so yeah yeah man that that is that that hits close to home for me because i i felt the same way you know i had jobs that i didn't like and i never found something that felt right and my my motivator was always to get something that i liked and so like learning the code was i saw that as a path out so that that's really cool and and you know this this clearly worked for you right you're you're at twitter now so how did you go from you know you were you were working you were learning code at your other job that you wanted to get out of and you've you've since obviously you're no longer in the military you're now working at twitter how did that journey happen like where how did you kind of get from from learning to having the job so i always say it's like a being at the right place at the right time one of the things when i first got started and i uh i acquired my internet and twitter i almost didn't like to tell the story because i felt like it was it just kind of like seemed like a movie moment and i was just like i mean of course i mean i never thought it would happen to me and someone else would have told me i would have been like oh yeah that's never gonna happen to me but i did but so from those long nights coding and in like my job on the military base uh there will be pilots that will come in all the time and of course we're we're at uh travis surfers base so this is probably like i believe the biggest air force base uh in uh like silicon valley bay area so i feel like a lot of the pilots they like new people like in those circles um so one night i would be coding and i would just come in and talk to the pilots and uh one thing i kind of noticed early on is the whole it's not what you know it's who you know thing so i noticed that networking was like very important so i would just talk to everyone so uh before i was coding i would talk to people about like oh i want to have a business one day uh whether or not it turned into something fruitful i would just talk about it just because it was always on my mind uh so one of the pilots uh he came here one night and we were just talking about code and stuff and we mentioned something about uh like the twitter blackburners or something and that's like the employee research group for uh for black people and uh he just said like he knew one of them i was just like oh what are the chances of that so he said he knew someone there was a black bird and i was just like oh you know can you introduce me to this person so you know just totally just uh making conversation and he was like sure so uh he ended up uh introducing me to this person and uh she was awesome we ended up like just making like this this bond brother sister bond over like i would say the course of maybe like 12 to 18 months i would say okay this whole time i'm always talking to her just letting her know how my progress is going uh telling her she has to save me from this job [Laughter] and stuff like that um and just kind of just telling her like my goals and like okay i learned how to do this and uh this whole time she's like we never had like a like a formal like plan um it was more of just she was just telling me about the opportunities that were out there uh so i just kept in contact with her and so i just kept coding and coding and then eventually we get to the point where i'm like on the last couple months of like my my listening and uh like you have to go to this class where they they uh try to get you ready to get a job as a civilian and i'm just like man i don't want a regular job you know like i want to be an engineer and so eventually she just approached me and she was just like uh okay i have this plan um if you can pass an interview i can get you an internship at twitter and so uh like what like i'm like this is crazy so uh like first uh twitter doesn't have like a program like this now we do which is actually pretty funny now we do actually have a apprenticeship program where if you're a person you come from like a nontraditional background you can come into twitter as an apprentice and uh actually become a fulltime software engineer but at this time it was just like you had to go to college um it was really like a like this is for you it's like you just passed the interview and i was just like i have to pass the interview so from that point forward i mean i was already pretty focused so i ended up having some mentors just teach me uh all of the sorts that i'm pretty sure we got like the merge sorts and bubble swords and every uh i think i did interview cake uh oh yeah yeah i was doing like everything i could a hacker rank i was doing as many hacker ranks as i could um because i just i really really wanted it was just like man this is my shot if i like if i fumble this this is like going to be the worst uh fumble in history or at least for my life yeah well there's actually a question from the chat oliver is asking um so you tackled the coding interviews by doing hacker rank interview cake things like that how was the the coding interview at twitter uh it was actually easier than i thought um i it was so it was for intern of course it was an intern so i mean i guess that's where uh like i said it's for students that just completed their bachelor's so i'm not sure like how that ranks uh for like a like another junior engineer but for me i feel like it was pretty it was pretty simple uh they did hit me with a question the interview was pretty funny because like i said i feel like i prepared a lot but um with these engineering interviews i feel like i don't really have a good analogy off the top of my head but i feel like you could prepare for like 99 of the problems but somebody hit you with that one question you like never just you never got that far to study that it just it could be like detrimental so i felt like i did really good with my interview one of the questions i remember uh was like if you have like a stack you're putting numbers on the stack how do you access the highest number in the stack in constant time um so that was one of the questions i had uh so i i definitely like had something like that before so i was able to solve that and then uh the other question that i got that i'll never forget because i knew i couldn't solve this problem beforehand and like i said it was just like uh please not this question so uh it was the one it's like uh if you have like a a n by n matrix or something okay or and by a matrix uh like how do you get from like the top left corner to the bottom right corner and i think it also includes like the just some spaces you can't go oh okay like yeah i just like admitted i'm terrible with uh matrices like when it comes to code like i do not like trying to traverse like the matrix like with the code um so that was a question i got and uh i did good on all the other questions but when i got that question it like it felt like someone could pull it up like a stake and i was just like man this is it but so so when you got that question you just told them you know like this is the you just kind of you're like look this i this isn't for me yes so yeah they definitely so like i said it was a unique situation so they were like okay we're not uh i mean everyone at twitter they were kind of like it was a new process because like oh we never interviewed someone right but you know you didn't go to college for computer science so i was like we don't know what you learned um so she just kind of uh she was nice enough to like kind of gauge like where i was at so she asked me that question and i was just like i think i pretty much just thought i was like uh i think i tried person i'm just like yeah i can solve this and uh she ended up making like a taking me like to a simpler version of the problem that i was able to say oh nice i started building my way up to uh like almost solving the the one that i couldn't solve in the first place that's cool so yeah so it was like i mean um that's one thing that it's not all about solving a problem uh it's about like kind of like seeing how you could collaborate and work through learning the problem so so yeah we had really great communication and i was just like yeah guess all that and it's okay let's see what you can solve and work up to that so you know overall it was a good result but still stake to the heart you bring up a really good point though which is like i actually think that at least for me one of the things that i'm looking for when i'm interviewing is someone's selfawareness and their willingness to ask for help and so if if i was interviewing someone and i asked him a question they didn't know the answer to if they were to kind of close down and get frustrated and and try to solve and not ask for help to me that's kind of a that's a sign that it's not going to work out right i'm looking i'm looking for what you did i'm looking for someone to say you know i haven't done this before i i'm not sure if i was going to start i'd start like this but i don't really know where to go from there and then you know what you have the conversation how do you think about code how do you how were you were going to approach solving this problem because in a real job you're not going to be solving and like traverse and n by n matrix yeah right never seen a matrix since yeah exactly right so i'm not really interested in whether or not you memorized how to traverse a matrix i'm i'm interested in how you would approach solving that problem um because like i don't think i can solve that problem like i don't work with matrices ever it's a couple problems like that where it's like i don't ever i don't ever want to leave twitter because i'm just like if i get one of these problems i'm just like [Laughter] i'm going back to my office uh the other one is like i don't know it's like find the the large the largest set of increasing numbers in like a a set of numbers and it's just like yeah i couldn't i think i've seen a solution to that one and i've watched like three videos on it and i'm like i don't get how like a dark knight at this point i'm just like oh yeah i'm gonna just keep my job and i'm not gonna fool them around with these the algorithm problems definitely get me i uh yeah and i like i feel for people who are are trying to get through that because i feel like those algorithm problems are are one of those things it's like taking a test in in school it's you're you're cramming for test taking not really for the job um so actually that's there's a question there which is uh a couple people asked adarsh asked uh how are you staying motivated especially when it's something kind of frustrating so when you were first learning and then uh probably asked like when you're moving on to the next topic uh they they forget the one that they learned before so how when you're learning how do you go about like keeping your motivation up and making sure you retain the stuff that you're learning making sure i retain so is this like in reference to interviewing or like i think i'm always just kind of curious about like learning processes in general so when you when you're going to learn anything whether it's studying for an interview or you just you've got a new problem you want to tackle how would you break down you know not getting frustrated uh and staying motivated to learn it and also making sure that as you're learning it you're retaining the the new information okay so first i would tackle like the the retention part uh so i feel like that's just the easier part for me so i definitely would say that uh when it comes to like learning how to code and learning like the different subjects i don't think i worry about retention at all just because i feel like oh if you do it enough it's gonna like stick and i always like to tell people when they first start learning you don't have to remember everything off the top of your head like we have so many resources available when you're doing your job daytoday so i like to tell people like that like i stay on google a lot at work so uh so when it comes to retention i don't really feel like you have to retain every bit of knowledge you have uh or every knowledge that you're reading about on a particular topic uh i would say you just need to keep a reference to it so it's not like a being an engineer is not like a closed book test at all like i feel like you you can ask anyone you guys google uh you could probably ask jason if he has time you guys need yeah yeah fine uh so it's not like a closed book test it's if you if you don't uh remember something if you could remember like i don't know like i remember i was teaching my auntie how to code and i forgot how to do a closing tag in html and like i'm saying this was probably like a month or two ago in html and i'm just like mass is embarrassing i'm just like i have to google it like to see like how do you close the tag html so that is something i don't feel like i would ever forget but unless you're like working with it every day i don't like you're going to just be like super fluent in it and remember it off the top of your head but i know how to google how do you close the tag in html and i'm like oh i know how to do it now you know i i honestly i feel like that is the most valuable skill that we learn is like i don't think that a a senior developer staff developer is necessarily a better developer than anyone else i think they've just learned more of the vocabulary more of the context so they know what to google like if you know if i ask um what i've noticed a lot is that when i'm talking to someone who's just learning they're like i don't know how to solve this and i'm and i'm looking at the problem they're solving i'm saying okay well what would you search and they're like i don't know i don't know what this is called and so the the learning isn't necessarily i don't know how to solve this problem it's i don't even know what to call this problem i don't know where to start looking for a solution and so the more we learn the more we build that vocabulary and that that web where we can say i've seen a problem kind of like this i think this is called matrix traversal or or whatever right and then we know what to google to go figure out how to solve that problem um i would definitely agree with that just like like what problem you're solving but i don't think like trying to retain everything like software is just it's just it's just too vast and i mean yeah i mean it's not also i mean in addition to it being gas it's evolving so it's like there's new stuff coming out and then the stuff you're already working with is still like evolving so it's just memorized everything so it's just good to kind of just keep like a mental map of like okay like i know the gist of it to where i can google for help but uh something that surprised me too when i first got to twitter uh of course this is my first engineering job ever so i'm thinking like okay like i'm just someone to learn how to code on free code camp and i'm here with uh everyone that went to like berkeley and mit and i was like oh god uh thinking everyone would know everything on the top of their head but but it was really refreshing to see like the uh the more senior engineers like and they have like the same questions i do in meetings or uh you ask them for help and like they'll google stuff that you're like wow i don't think he would know that off the top of his head or um like i'm surprised they didn't know that uh i mean so it's not like a like a slight to them it's just like it's competent to know like oh this is what being an engineer is like it's not like you have to know everything it's not like jeopardy where it's just like hey you can't act yeah so it is that is definitely like uh comforting to me to see uh for sure on like access stuff like that and then what was the second part of the question the second part of the question was about staying motivated because a lot of times especially when we're learning things like coding it's it's abstract it can feel like it's a whole lot and we're never going to learn it all which as you've just stated we never will we're never going to learn at all so how do you how do you keep from getting discouraged and keep your motivation up when you're when you're trying to tackle something that's challenging uh so i would i feel like i'm i'm probably gonna be like uh i don't want people to be like me when i was learning so when i was learning like i had a pretty strong motivator which was the military and i didn't like my situation so that was all the motivation i needed i was like hey you don't do this you're going to be stuck here so that was like that was my motivation so uh so i feel like that's kind of it's not like not that it doesn't apply to everyone right so it's like i feel like everyone has to find like a reason that they're coding because like i said i feel like anyone can do it but if you don't have like to keep you motivated i don't feel like uh it's gonna be a lot harder something that i would do differently when i was learning is i took this kind of like siloed approach where i would just uh learn like i'll take my laptop either at work or at home and i'll just learn so i know free code kind of has like the like chats and forums that you can go and ask for help and i was pretty stubborn about it i was just like look if i can't learn this by myself i don't want to learn it and i would spend like hours on a problem like but as long as i could complete it by myself i would uh i would spend the time so i would say definitely learning with others like because i mean like your team you can like keep each other accountable uh kind of keep the momentum going um so i definitely wouldn't suggest learning alone unless you have like a very extreme motivator like i did um and then uh so that was my motivator while i was like in the military but uh now that i'm uh like i'm actually engineering on that twitter now i would say what motivates me is uh just trying to figure out how to be like a better engineer um it wasn't like always the best when i first transitioned it was pretty tough going from like the military background to tech um for a lot of reasons uh mostly like being in the military and being at a tech company or like polar opposites uh so you know i couldn't even have a beard when i was in the military so you know i'm like i get to have a beard i get to say hey to the ceo at lunch you know yeah so it was it was pretty tough at first but i find just trying to figure it out and be like a better engineer is a pretty good motivator for me yeah just because i still feel like sometimes some days i still feel like a puppy uh in the engineering world so so that's a pretty big motivator for me yeah well and it's cool too like i i think there's a threshold that gets crossed like i've i've i've seen this in a lot of folks where when they're first starting to learn to code it feels like it feels like going to math class or it feels like going to you know to an english class where you're breaking down grammar you're you're trying to memorize algorithms you're trying to do stuff that you're like i don't get how any of this is going to work and then there's a threshold you cross where it starts to make sense and you go from having to think really really hard about how anything works to where you can kind of just you can just write a little bit of code and you can start to build things and when you move from that like i have to struggle to remember how the syntax works to i know the syntax now i can just kind of do that by feel and and i can just build the thing that i want to build that's where i've started to see a lot of you know there's momentum and there's motivation because now you're not it's not frustrating or as frustrating you're you're now able to like create something and as soon as you get to that point where you can create it's like oh now what else could i create what else could i make and and you it creates like a positive feedback loop where you you get to see yourself succeed and each one of those successes gives you more motivation to try the next thing um and i i love you know it's but it's also hard because you got to push that boulder up that hill to get the momentum like you've got to cross that threshold yeah so i try to trust me i try to get almost everyone i know to code yeah my wife she's been batting me away for years at this point but i always tell people whenever you get started you just have to trust the process uh if you get started on preco count it's gonna look like gibberish uh of course but i would say when i started when i got serious on precode count i would say it was maybe it could have been more than like a few weeks to where i would like stand back from the screen i'd be like whoa like i'm actually writing this like this is pretty crazy um so there's definitely like a point you'll get to where you can see the growth like you'll see yourself writing stuff and you'll be like uh two weeks ago this would have this would have never made any sense this was like like you wouldn't even know it would look like alien uh code or something like that but uh so i definitely like uh agree uh and then also i like to compare uh coding to english it's like i feel like when people say i can't learn how to code it's too hard i was like what if you would have said like oh i can't learn english it's too hard like you're a baby like you just i'm not gonna try uh it sounds like gibberish uh i'm never gonna learn how to put uh like the correct grammar and punctuation i'm just going to talk about the baby forever um so uh so that's what that's the analogy i use um when my family or friends tell me coding is too hard i'm just like you speak english right uh i mean apparently i've heard english as one of the harder languages to learn so it is yeah so it's like you can learn english you learn how to code i mean it's not uh it's not that much different you just have to trust yourself that you're gonna by immersion eventually you're gonna start coding so absolutely so like you said when you start pushing the motor you just have to realize i mean this is kind of like a boater that gets smaller as you push it so yep that's just something to keep in mind when you uh first get started yeah yeah that's such a that's such a cool thing um so something i'd love to talk a little bit more about is you you mentioned that like your path into your internship opportunity was was not like an overnight thing this was something that you built over more than a year um and i want to talk a little bit about that because i think that people undervalue this part of getting a job and you already said this but it's it's not what you know it's who you know um and so uh to just recap a little bit you you were working in the airport through a pilot you got connected to somebody who was a part of the blackbirds organization at twitter and you could have stopped there you could have said that's so cool that you know somebody who's a blackbird at twitter and then never said anything right but you asked you were like hey i can i get connected and then after you got connected you kept in touch you updated on progress and you you kept doing the work and showing your work and eventually that led to her doing some work to get you the interview right and so that i think is such a fascinating like it would be so easy to say oh i know a blackbird of twitter and then you just kind of like well right now that's somebody i know on on the internet and like i like their posts sometimes or you can put that work in you can build that network um how have you found networking like obviously in this case it played a huge role but like have you seen it play in other aspects of your life or in other aspects of your career where it's been beneficial like that uh yes definitely not uh so much like definitely not like getting into twitter but there are a few instances i have uh so for example i was on twitter uh i don't even i don't think i even knew how to code at this point right even begun to go but uh it was someone i think he is the i think he may be the cto of coinbase right now uh balaji but he uh he was like he came out with this like bitcoin computer back then uh and i just remember he came up with it and i forgot how old i was but it was like 400 and i was just like man you know i can't afford that so i ended up just like i dm'd him or i tweeted at him i was just like oh you know like i actually like a product tester or something and he's like oh um send me an email or something and he ended up sending me one for free um just oh damn with some feedback and uh so at the time i mean uh coming from like never having anything like that happen i'm just like wow i got this free it was like a raspberry pi but they were selling them for like 400 because they had bitcoin mining chips in them oh okay yeah uh yeah and he just gave me one free so that was pretty powerful to me just be like hey just tweeting i can get like free stuff uh sounds like my first taste of like oh wow you just like talk to the right person they could make things happen for you another thing is i had reached out to someone and they got me like a it wasn't like an internship it was more like a it was a startup and uh they were i forgot the name of it but uh they were doing like um problem solving like they would take problems from like companies and come up with like solutions and uh i ended up like doing like a i wouldn't say like an internship but i was like building like a dashboard for them okay it was probably like the first the first world stacked app i ever built and they were paying me like uh like 500 bucks like a month or something like that but it was kind of crazy because i was just like what um it was like i guess you can say that was the first time i got paid for coding but uh but again i was like a connection i made on twitter where i was just reaching out to people like hey you know like this is what i'm trying to do this is what i'm interested in uh do you know anybody that could help so it's just like you never know like who you're talking to or uh like what they know who they know what they can what they have access to um and that works both ways because i met some people that were pretty uh like i call them lumberjacks because i feel like they chop your dreams down but i met a few lumberjacks you know so the lumberjacks they can be people that are in great positions too but they may not just see things like you see them so you have to stay away from them yeah but yeah so i just found just talking to people and then like i said i mean don't force it but i feel like it just actually comes out like if you're coding all the time or you're trying to make a company i feel like it's on your mind so you start talking to anybody like in a coffee shop or um online like you're just gonna naturally just like hey this is kind of what i'm into and what i'm working on um so so those are two times where i got like a huge example of like hey you talk to people tell them what you're interested in and like hey i mean people i mean a lot of people say this people want to see you succeed like i mean it's like all they have to do is make like an intro and you know like i can have like what i consider like i feel like i'm living in an alternate reality i say that a lot like uh not on twitter i feel like i'm like i just i should still be in the military right now but it's like i put the work in and met some cool people and you know i'm with a better version of my life so uh so so if you can live a better version of your life and also have to do is uh make an intro people will do it i feel like like a lot of people will do that so speaking as as someone who's had the opportunity to make a couple of those intros nothing feels better than being the person who can help you know if i have a friend who's looking to hire and i have someone who's looking for a job and i can put them together and like everybody ends up happy i feel amazing like nothing feels better than being able to help two people solve a problem and you know to so when when we're talking about like make yourself available to people show people what you're doing that's not that's not selfish you are you are being just as good a member of the community by letting people know that you are looking for work what kind of work you're looking for what your strengths are like if i see that and i see that you're looking i have a bunch of friends who work in tech who are always like hey do you know a good like distributed systems engineer hey do you know a good like senior node engineer if i can see people in my network who are doing that work and looking i'm 100 going to connect them every time but if i don't know what you're working on i don't know what you're interested in i'm not just going to like haphazardly recommend you for a job so you're you're doing everyone a favor when you do that like i yeah i cannot stress that enough like how helpful it is to me yeah i have a funny fact i'd like to say that uh i mean it sounds so insane when i say it out loud but uh when i got out the military i only put in one job application oh man that is wild and that was the twitter so uh yeah i had a uh my daughter was one at the time and a lot of people like to go like to this thing called tax where like i said they teach you how to get a job when you get out and help make your resume and um it's like i put in one application uh and i'm just still like blown away like man i was really confident but like i said i was really going hard studying and everything for my uh for my interview so so yes i was like uh i mean i was just telling myself like like failure is just not an option here i mean i like that though like i think there's something to be said for for going all in on a plan um i that was that was sort of a thing that i did as well i i got exactly enough freelance work that i wouldn't like get kicked out of my house like i had enough to clear rent and i was like whatever i'll eat ramen i'm going all in on being a software engineer and i quit my day job and i like immediately that that confidence that i felt when i quit like i had a rough couple of months where i did i cleared rent and that was just about it i ate a lot of like cup noodles but man i was i was an engineer like it felt real and that let me land more clients that let me like go all in on this job and that's led to me being where i am now and so i love i love when somebody bets on themselves like it's it's one of my favorite things to see put all the eggs in one basket so that was but yeah like i said i had built that relationship for 18 months and then when it came to the interview like i was i think i was doing like maybe every other day like uh video calls like with uh here who's helping me uh she's helping me learn like algorithms and the sorts and stuff oh so you had like an interview coach yeah so i didn't have an interview that's good i guess i left a part of my story out uh so when i when the pilot made the intro to the uh lady at twitter i ended up going there for the first time and i just went to the hq and just met her um and that was uh i met like a few engineers also when i met like the first few engineers i've ever met and um like a couple of those people i just kept in contact with them so uh like yeah one of them were they were my interview coach so when i twitter was my interview coach that's really nice but yeah so i would go up there almost every chance i can get um i think i live where i lived it was maybe like an hour and a half from the uh sf hq um so it was kind of a hike but i mean it was so cool like that was one of the the biggest things that was a big motivator too so uh anyone could get i mean when the world opens back up you can get like a tour of like a tech company i feel like that's pretty motivating too um from the military with our working conditions uh not saying like they're like the worst in the world but compared to like a tech company yeah the twitter hq like they're getting uh like we were getting like breakfast every day much every day it's like four cafeterias you got these snack kitchenettes everywhere you got famous people that'll visit us um uh you get to see jack walking around which still my mind uh like it was just uh like a whole it's a whole different way everyone's wearing clothes that they want to wear uh you can have facial hair it was just like a felt like a different planet i mean some places it won't be that extreme right military tech company is like the most extreme i think you can get so i was like blown away like yeah i had like people are working here and i'm like on twelves um so that definitely like just kind of uh helped my motivation piece um yeah then that's actually kind of interesting too because when you when you made that that tour um and like you started keeping contact with with engineers that worked at twitter you had the interview coach did you feel like like at that moment you kind of started to believe it was possible for you uh like like possible to work at twitter well just like possible to have that career to be an engineer to do the things that you wanted to do um that's a good question i don't i mean it kind of sounds like did i feel like i was ready uh well i actually mean it in a different way so so there's um the the way that i mean it is like i i feel like we have a tendency to sort of put ourselves into into whichever box we surround ourselves with right so like if if i'm surrounded by people who think that you know like when i was younger a lot of my friends they all worked in like warehouses construction things like that and they all just kind of had assumed that was as far as they were gonna go and so a lot of my mindset was the same i was like oh yeah i'll probably just like you know build houses or something um and then when i when i started hanging out with people who thought that more was possible i was like wait i could do more i couldn't do more couldn't i and then i started dreaming bigger and and so i'm kind of wondering like it sounds like you already had big dreams like so i'm not saying you know like the the getting an intro was there but like where did you find that threshold really was crossed for you where you you started to really think like you know what this isn't just a dream i'm going to do this uh so like you said i do think i always like kind of thought big like i wanted to have my own company i didn't think it would be like software or building uh like an app or anything like that but i did get to a point in the military where like you said it was exactly like what you just said in the military uh you retire after doing 20 years of service so a lot of people i mean that's like oh you can get a retirement check every 20 years so you'll meet a lot of people did that's what they want to do they want to do their 20 years and get out um and that wasn't my intentions when i came in like i had a sixyear contract should have been four but i was 19 so gotta forgive myself but uh i came in and so now i'm surrounded by all of these people that just they want to do 20 years uh and i'm just like you know i don't want to do 20 years i mean i didn't know what i wanted to do so i think that was probably like a like a uh like a hindrance for me like oh i need like a i needed like some direction nevertheless it's easy to be caught up in what everyone else wants to do so there was a point where i was i remember saying to myself i'm going to do 20 years like this is something like i was like no way like this is not what i'm doing and then i remember saying that to myself and uh it was actually uh one of uh we had civilians that we worked with yeah and it was actually one of the civilians uh his name was gary and i would always talk to him because he wanted to uh buy a porsche 911 when he retired okay he was like working on his second retirement when he retired for the second time he wanted a fortune 911. i just always remember that he would uh talk about like yeah my wife's gonna let me get him when i'm retiring so i remember one day i was talking to him and i tell him i was like yeah when i retired from the military and get a porsche like yours you know just just uh joking around and stuff and um like i swear i'll never forget this he said uh he called me jj because we called each other by our initials at work and he was like jj you won't have to say goodbye porsche and i just like no logics and that took me on like a mind trip i was just like what does he mean by that and then it was like at that moment like the old me i want to start a company and build something and like just not settle for just anything i just like woke up and like from that day forward i just been like hey like i'm gonna be the ceo like my own company one day and i don't care what anybody says about it um so from that day forward like i was just like uh and then it also gave me like a pretty strong shield because after that day i kind of just realized like man if you're around like people just putting the wrong things into your head uh you can kind of get like sidetracked from like your dreams and your goals so from that day i would say yes i felt like yes i could be engineered yes i could be the ceo of my own company if i wanted to i could be i could be anything i want to so after like shaking that off uh yes i definitely believed i could whether i was ready is a different question but as far as like the box no boxes i don't do boxes anymore yeah i love that though and and like who's who's ever ready like i i honestly if you told me i was going to interview a twitter tomorrow i don't know i'd probably bomb it i definitely bombed it facebook when i interviewed back a while ago but you know i think it's one of those things like i you know i've also since worked at other startups and i i nailed the technical interviews so a lot of it is also on like just taking the chances right like i you know i worked at ibm and my technical interview there was great we like reviewed projects together and like refactored things and it wasn't an algorithm interview facebook i was interviewing for front end and they were like hey do you want to write some sql queries and i was like i don't think i'm interviewing for the right job [Laughter] yeah i write those sometimes at work but i saw i use google like i just uh just enough to get like uh like the data back that uh that's useful for me but by no means am i pro but but yes that's how that is definitely how i feel no no boxes are allowed i can't i can't go back to that i love that interest it's dangerous i mean i wouldn't be i mean if i would have stayed in that box i mean like yes i just i just moved to michigan um because of the pandemic we were allowed to move so i just moved back home um with my uh to be closer to family and stuff and i'm i still have my job and i'm just like wow i work at twitter i live i'm i'm back home you know like i'm seeing my family yeah and i'm just thinking like this would have been nonexistent you know if i would have just stayed in that box like oh i mean i think i would be let me say i would have uh 12 years left before i retired dang that i wouldn't have been happy though yeah so so yeah so that's why i said the lumberjacks are just you have to have to stay away from yeah oh man i love that so much that's uh and it's such a heartwarming story like i love i love when you can kind of draw like a point like there's there's a conversation i had that that like realigned me and uh and it sounds like talking to to gary like what a what a cool moment to be able to just be like oh yeah like i almost i almost did a whole different life i could have been somebody completely different dad yeah i don't know so i actually have i think it was that same day it might not have been that same day but he wrote me a sticky note um it says your uh your vision determines your destination and like yeah i still have that sticky note in my closet somewhere i'm gonna frame it but yeah so uh gary he wrote that for me and uh thank you like i said it was around the same time that he told me i wouldn't have to say for a portion i was just like like yeah i just i was just it was crazy it was just like man he sees like he obviously sees who i was and like motivation and the dreams i had when i first got there and for me it was just like i always say i was in a sunken place pretty much yeah yeah i like get out like i'm just like the real me is down there like just no that's not what you want so uh yeah so gary he just i can't remember what they used in a movie but he just woke me up and now she's like what oh yeah so ever since then it's been like nah uh i gotta even if they 99 of startups well i'm like hey uh i have to have to play my hand just to see what it's gonna do so um so yeah that is i never forget that moment yeah no no so i i have a couple a couple more questions before we wrap up um so i want to i want to kind of twist this around we've got a lot of people watching now who are just getting into the industry they're taking free code camp right now they're they're learning um and so i want to just kind of ask you for all the people who are out there trying to get in um like one one specific question is what type of projects did you have in your portfolio and and kind of what would you recommend folks focus on if they're if they're looking to build their own portfolio if they're looking to build their own portfolio so uh when i tell people to learn now i usually just tell them to go through retail camp and build like the portfolio stuff mostly because i feel like that's what gave me a lot of my confidence at first like you feel like i think it was like a simon game like a javascript calculator i feel like all of that is like good stuff and then um some of the other stuff that i love i love to do um and actually i felt like this was probably the best preparation i had uh to for being like an engineer at twitter and that is following projects on youtube so uh it's a guy who watches videos what is his name brad his name's brad uh i forgot his last name is it traversing media yes yeah yeah yeah so i used to watch his videos and he would uh he would go from like zero to like a hundred making like a full full stack project and it would be awesome for a portfolio and not only that but after i was finished watching brad i would go in there and like tinker and like like my own like app you know so um so i mean like you could build it and repurpose it for something and yeah probably like the best experience you're gonna get for uh like to prepare uh to be an engineer at like a big company uh just because something i didn't realize is that when you're a junior engineer you're not going to go into the company building services from scratch right oh i feel like that was a big misconception i had like i'm gonna go in here i'm gonna have to start like i'm gonna have to build like a full stack out but when you get in you realize that you're you're only going to be updating and uh building on existing code like you're not starting up as like a service from scratch like that's mostly like senior work senior level work so i mean if you could come in and do that i mean yeah you're a rock star but yeah that's the bar like i have to come in building like a whole service from scratch so uh the way i link those two is you build like a project from like brad and then uh you tinker with it you make modifications to it you learn how to code works and you'll be well prepared to get into another company where you're going to get thrown into like a super random code base uh you're just going to have to go and do the exact same thing which is learning how it works and learning how to update and extend it um so i would definitely say following those uh those videos online and building them and just uh seeing how they work internally we'll give you like a lot of experience yeah definitely way more than prepare for uh like learning algorithms and stuff like that yeah yeah well i mean it's kind of one of those things it's a it's a little bit of a you got to do both unfortunately right but um but i think to your point that's almost a skill that we forget is that a lot of what we're doing is not inventing new code a lot of what we're doing is i'm going to inherit your code and i have to look at it and understand it and then make it do something mostly the same but a little bit different or i have to patch one small bug i don't get to start from scratch and that interpretation that ability to comprehend somebody else's code that's probably the most valuable skill you can have as someone who's new yes definitely so like you said you do have to learn both which is unfortunate but uh what in terms of actually being on the job and doing work uh yes learning how to inherit code i guess is a good way to say it and learn how to work into your code oh i own this file let me figure out how can i make it more efficient um how do i extend it how do i test it locally and uh how do i review it because you're gonna have to review other people's code there's probably a close proximity to it so like i would definitely say that gives you like a lot of experience so you're going to be building a portfolio you're going to be learning how different technologies work and you're also if you follow the video step by step you're going to be able to look at someone else's code and figure out how it works um which is always not as straightforward as you would like it to be so getting a lot of experience early on would just help you just go like a lot further once you get into your job yeah for sure so uh so one last question before we wrap up uh for all the folks out there who are trying to get their first opportunity and trying to get their foot in the door um you've already talked about you know your your networking your ability to visit the twitter campus what what do you recommend for folks who maybe don't have the opportunity to go to a company's headquarters or to meet people in person especially now that we're in the pandemic how would you recommend trying to get a similar sort of networking going remotely especially you know we've got a lot of folks joining today from india or from other places around the world um how do you think they can they can get that similar sort of connection without the ability to be physically there uh so i don't think uh it needs to be physical like like i said some of the first like networking opportunities uh given they weren't for jobs but uh i feel like it still was like a example of how networking can open doors for you uh we're on twitter so like you don't really need the physical aspect so i actually wrote an article about uh how i started on free code camp ended up interning at twitter all right this article i just talked about from a to b pretty much a lot of the stuff i've said here and i think at the at the end of the article i was just like hey anyone has any questions email me you know people email me to ask questions i mean at this point i'm like full of time on twitter so i mean it's like i'm like hey i could be your connection at twitter i mean i'm not saying i could get you a for sure job but i could introduce you to people i could help you study i could help you learn yeah i'm gonna talk to you about your journey and i would say maybe one or two people email me um and then only one that i talked to to this day and she was just like really really like adamant about it like hey like you know like i have questions for you man like i still keep in contact with her to this day and she uh i forgot the company she's got a job at a company but she's like she's on it like she's reading these articles and people say hit them up she's hitting them up uh because i mean like if you if you're hitting people up i mean if you get like a 10 10 rate i mean you hit up 10 people a day some one person is going to talk back to you you know you don't know who that one person is so i definitely i mean if anything in the kind of probably made it easier you just sit in your room and probably get connected with the world well it's also removed that physical advantage that other people might have had like i can't go drop into somebody's office i have to email them too or send them a dm or or whatever yes i mean it's a different like uh like something that i never thought of which one of my good friends helped me realize is that a lot of the social media platforms they're helpful for getting in contact with people absolutely like instagram i've never had instagram i didn't have it for like maybe like five or six years and then one of my friends he was just like you gotta get on instagram you know like there's a lot of tech people and vcs on twitter i mean on uh instagram it's like you can talk to them and it's just like you know they're there and they're like you know like you can go and interact with them and talk to them and they're very influential people uh yeah i mean you could go on twitter uh instagram facebook probably not linkedin because it's just too expected there are a lot of ways to just find people and then they have like the virtual conferences now but uh but i would say the main thing is i mean you just can't be scared like just just throw throw up the emails i mean i'm not saying throw up like a canned email because you don't like that but but if you're reading uh you see like interviews and like i'm like hey you know just reach out i mean it doesn't take that long to respond to the email absolutely um so yeah so yeah like the person i mentioned like uh i forgot i would have to see how many reasons i got on that it was a lot it was i believe it was five figures so tens ten thousand no more people that's not a lot of emails off of yeah so i mean that but that's a good that's a thing like if you're out there thinking that if you take a shot you're gonna be one of hundreds of of people in this person's inbox chances are that's not the case because everybody thinks that everybody thinks that everybody's sending and nobody is like i don't get a lot of emails you're not getting a lot of emails like i don't think that that people are as flooded as you think so i think if you if you reach out and you're in you're genuinely asking not don't spam me for connections but like ask what are you working on what are you stuck on what are you excited about like we want to hear from you that's fun for us that's what we do with our friends right we're at time so um let me let me do this let me where should people go if they want to if they want to keep in touch with you is there a platform you prefer twitter of course what's your what's your twitter handle it is toothpips amazing um can i i don't know if i can type it in here but um i'll type it i have to i have to recommend that flap there it is okay yeah i spelled it right but yes so now i guess we're going to hey look i guess after saying that i mean if i get a photo dms i can't all right let me let me get this dropped into the uh into the into the youtube chat there you are all right so uh definitely go give jordan a follow um you know take a look for that that free code camp article quincy if you are in the chat if you can you can drop that um and then yeah otherwise like thank you so much for being here today um if if you all want to see more of these we've got more connecting the dots on the free code camp youtube there's a series of them they're in a playlist you can you can just search for uh connect the dots on there um jordan thank you again for taking the time to hang out with us today any any parting words for everyone uh any part in words oh yeah so my phrase that i find is protect your dreams uh you're gonna meet some lumberjacks out there that are gonna try to take you out say you can't do it uh say whatever they're gonna say but you just have to stay focused and just get to the goal so those will be my performance i love it steer clear of those lumberjacks i am i'm so on board with that made with that or something it's good man it's real good uh if you want to learn more with me i run a weekly live stream on twitch at uh learnwithjason.dev or twitch.tv uh jaylangsdorf and you can come hang out with me we learn something i i pair with people uh we try to learn something new in 90 minutes couple times a week it's a lot of fun this has been a lot of fun man this has been so much fun thank you so much for hanging out jordan thank you to the free code camp team thank you chad for for hanging out with us and we'll see you all next time see ya
