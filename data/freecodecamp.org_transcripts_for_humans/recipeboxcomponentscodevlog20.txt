00:00 - this week that two main Heroes es6 and
00:10 - [Music]
00:19 - react I'm watching the tutorial about
00:22 - web because this is not the time that I
00:25 - have to come back to it and I don't feel
00:28 - really uh secure in it so
00:30 - uh I'm trying to understand how to
00:32 - configure the next steps with web back
00:35 - in the recipe box
00:43 - [Music]
00:58 - project
01:06 - I'm watching es6 tutorial the recipe
01:09 - project I want to finish I want to write
01:10 - in es6 I want to learn more about es6
01:13 - because I didn't do it last year I
01:15 - didn't use it last
01:17 - [Music]
01:26 - year now it's another tutorial for today
01:30 - and Tuesday was devoted to es6 the
01:34 - thought that comes to my mind is that we
01:37 - postpone learning new things very often
01:40 - very often it's
01:42 - like H it's not the time it will be too
01:46 - difficult looking at it it seems to be
01:50 - like changing writing to CSS to SAS so
01:54 - it's like going step further U making
01:58 - things easier uh writing less code and
02:02 - achieving the same
02:03 - results but the thing is that we are
02:06 - afraid and lazy sometimes we are looking
02:09 - for the excuses and we avoid learning
02:11 - something new just why because it's new
02:14 - or we think that's really difficult sure
02:17 - I'll have to devote sometime to
02:19 - introduce uh these es6 uh in my code and
02:23 - remember about them and for sure I will
02:25 - be rechecking it a few times but the
02:28 - things sometimes are really easy and we
02:30 - make them really difficult because we
02:33 - are lazy or we simply don't want to try
02:36 - it because it's new this was my case
02:39 - with
02:42 - [Music]
02:54 - [Music]
02:58 - es6
03:02 - it's Wednesday I restructure a bit the
03:04 - project in order to keep the uh files
03:08 - that I produce separately from those
03:10 - that will go to the production server
03:12 - and today I'm finally starting working
03:14 - on um moving the components from layout
03:18 - uh into react components into changing
03:21 - on their display into react
03:25 - [Music]
03:28 - display
03:31 - [Music]
03:58 - do
04:06 - [Music]
04:18 - [Music]
04:28 - pap
04:41 - [Music]
04:58 - a
05:00 - [Music]
05:28 - BL
05:32 - [Music]
05:58 - ba
06:04 - [Music]
06:26 - [Music]
06:28 - n
06:37 - [Music]
06:58 - PA
07:00 - it's the end of the week and this is
07:02 - what I managed to do in this app this
07:06 - week I load the content right now with
07:10 - react so as you see in this create
07:13 - recipe uh I got a header component text
07:18 - component image
07:20 - component uh and they are totally buil
07:23 - uh with react right now so these Purple
07:27 - colors are react components let's see it
07:31 - in the code so I divided uh the content
07:35 - from HTML uh into components and
07:40 - Pages components right now are almost
07:43 - ready uh these are the smaller blocks
07:46 - and they use um the props and they are
07:51 - loaded dynamically they change
07:55 - dynamically I use props in majority of
07:59 - of them to pass the uh
08:04 - data because these components will be
08:07 - reusable so States uh weren't the best
08:10 - choice here in order to make the
08:12 - components reusable I had to make uh
08:16 - conditioning like in
08:19 - tax tax is the element here so depending
08:23 - on The
08:24 - View TXS are rendered um in a different
08:28 - way for for example if the TX are
08:30 - editable uh so they are in create or
08:33 - addition mode uh I add them the class
08:38 - tags which uh places them to the left
08:41 - but if they are in the homepage view or
08:44 - in the recipe view of the of the details
08:46 - where I look at the details of the
08:48 - recipe uh they have uh the alignment to
08:52 - the right the data is rendered
08:54 - dynamically it's added dynamically uh so
08:58 - this part is almost done I think but
09:01 - pages right now the top
09:03 - level Pages still needs to be done next
09:07 - week this is another level so pages with
09:10 - details addition and home view uh I use
09:14 - the component so I use this stuff uh
09:17 - however Pages uh at the top level needs
09:21 - uh much more logic and whack next week
09:25 - and I'm going to come back to it um I
09:28 - think
09:30 - that first I will do the routine in
09:33 - order to be able to move between pages
09:37 - and change the content dynamically and
09:39 - later I will come back to the logic and
09:42 - local storage because what also one of
09:44 - the requirements for this project it's
09:48 - here number eight all new recipes I add
09:50 - are saved in my browser loal storage if
09:53 - I refer the page the recipes will still
09:56 - be there so routing uh and the logic at
10:00 - the top level of pages so here uh and um
10:06 - local storage still uh needs to be done
10:09 - still needs to be dealt with next week I
10:12 - will continue with recipe box
10:17 - project just like you would on an actual
10:20 - D you give it a prop so now if I go to
10:23 - my header JS take your SN access this
10:27 - choose the best video for
10:30 - keep on doing and see you next
10:32 - [Music]
10:44 - week
