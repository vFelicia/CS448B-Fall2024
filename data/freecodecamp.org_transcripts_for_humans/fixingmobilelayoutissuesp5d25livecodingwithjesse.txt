00:06 - everybody welcome to life coding with
00:08 - Jessie today we're gonna get back to
00:11 - work on the main website for Franciscan
00:16 - the University I work for sorry I was a
00:20 - few minutes late
00:20 - I turn it on the stream and I started
00:23 - dropping frames so let me know how the
00:27 - video is I tried turning off a few a few
00:31 - programs that I was working with earlier
00:33 - that I don't need so hopefully hopefully
00:39 - everything will work I was just looking
00:45 - to see if there's anything else I could
00:47 - turn off I don't think I can all right
00:50 - looks like the videos fine hey everybody
00:58 - alright so a little update on some of
01:01 - the projects I think I have for the
01:06 - catechetical Institute site for now I
01:09 - think everything's completed I'm just
01:10 - waiting on some content before I make
01:13 - those changes live I hope that comes in
01:16 - soon because we also updated all our
01:19 - packages and some of those packages that
01:22 - are currently on there are pretty old so
01:24 - I'd love to move to the new updated
01:26 - branch as soon as I can
01:31 - the stuff for the bulletin if you
01:34 - remember I've been talking about the
01:37 - university bulletin that I think is it's
01:40 - like you have to log in to get into it
01:43 - which i think is unnecessary but
01:47 - basically they're still going to be a
01:49 - login so that's not gonna change for now
01:54 - but we made it a little bit easier and
01:57 - was it yesterday stream I think we made
02:00 - it easier to get in so I think that'll
02:03 - be fine it'll take care of most of the
02:04 - issues
02:05 - that some of the users were having and
02:09 - the JavaScript AF site works being done
02:14 - on that so javascript sir that was in
02:17 - here yesterday is doing some design work
02:20 - building out a little bit of the the
02:22 - front end and just some basic HTML
02:25 - Harshit is working on the the server or
02:28 - the api so maybe we'll have something to
02:31 - see with that you know maybe hopefully
02:34 - soon I'm not gonna be able to work that
02:36 - much on it because this projects gonna
02:38 - take up a ton of my time I'm preparing
02:41 - to you know work over over my normal
02:44 - amount of time on this this morning I
02:47 - was just doing a lot of migrating data
02:49 - and who looks like the stream cut the
02:55 - black for a second is it all right now
03:01 - all right cool
03:05 - so anyway I was trying to migrate a
03:09 - bunch of data and some like my eyes are
03:14 - just so dry after staring at the the
03:17 - screen and anyway I'm glad to get back
03:21 - to doing some like front-end work my
03:26 - co-workers are looking in the door
03:31 - alright so let me check the live chat
03:34 - quickly just to say hello and see if
03:37 - there's any questions I should answer
03:39 - right away and then I'll show my screen
03:42 - and we'll get started let's see all
03:49 - right looks like a strange fun for most
03:50 - of you Stephen says today Jesse will be
03:53 - discussing beard care and the two
03:55 - buttons shirt rule ready go I did have
04:00 - my beard trimmed up a little bit when I
04:03 - got a haircut so it's freighting less
04:05 - scruffy than normal all right
04:12 - okay harsh it's adding commits to the PR
04:15 - I'll check out those PRS after the
04:17 - stream
04:21 - alright let's switch it up okay let me
04:25 - start my timer and we'll bring over our
04:39 - projects so I have updated this project
04:46 - this Franciscan react is the repo name
04:50 - I've updated this project too based on
04:59 - the pool request and I don't think
05:00 - there's any outstanding pool requests
05:02 - right now that are completed so I
05:06 - shouldn't we should be up to date I'm
05:11 - gonna double check though
05:16 - yep all the pool requests are in alright
05:20 - so some of the additions we have are the
05:23 - search the search animation works here
05:26 - which is awesome and I believe we went
05:30 - over yeah we went over this I mean
05:33 - yesterday I have some additions here we
05:36 - have a different color here so pretty
05:39 - good I'm happy about that and the pool
05:43 - requests were mainly so rook or nikki
05:49 - has added that search toggle and also
05:54 - those links that we just saw on the
05:55 - drawer also added committees in so when
06:01 - we go to do a commit I'm gonna try out
06:03 - this new way we're doing commits that
06:05 - should help have like a standard for for
06:10 - committing to get so we'll see how that
06:14 - works I think it'll be it'll take some
06:16 - getting used to at first but in the long
06:17 - run it should be should be better all
06:22 - right if I missed any PRS I'm sorry let
06:26 - me know and I'll I will give you credit
06:29 - for
06:30 - any PRS let's see
06:46 - let's see probably five days
06:51 - all right just double-checking the
06:55 - lights out again so today we want to fix
06:59 - some stuff with the mobile the mobile
07:03 - view I'd mention maybe yesterday that it
07:08 - looks I hadn't kept in mind at all the
07:14 - the mobile view of this and I I don't
07:18 - know why because we should be thinking
07:20 - mobile first based on the audience which
07:23 - is going to be primarily teenagers so
07:27 - today we're gonna try to clean this up
07:29 - and have it be acceptable for mobile I
07:35 - mean you can see right now this is just
07:37 - I think it's just ridiculous so bad and
07:45 - that's I mean that's my fault
07:49 - Wow okay let's start up here with with
07:53 - the header first thing I'd like to do is
07:55 - really remove all of this I'm just gonna
08:01 - remove everything for the mobile version
08:04 - of the header the only thing I might
08:06 - even consider keeping is a call to
08:08 - action but I don't think I'll keep that
08:10 - a thing I'm just gonna get rid of get
08:13 - rid of all of it and then see how it
08:15 - looks if it looks like we might have
08:17 - space to add anything in maybe but we'll
08:29 - check it out we'll see how it goes I'm
08:31 - not worried about the links right so we
08:33 - have all the links here so mobile users
08:36 - aren't missing out on anything
08:37 - they'll snowball the same content the
08:39 - only thing that'll be missing is you
08:42 - know this access fus and button and then
08:48 - these social icons
08:50 - maybe we can add those in here somewhere
08:56 - we'll see I could maybe access fus yeah
09:02 - we'll see maybe we'll add them in the
09:03 - side
09:05 - but first things first let's just get
09:07 - them out of here all right so oops wrong
09:15 - code so let's check up I don't need this
09:22 - right now
09:23 - do we need to let's keep the drawer up
09:26 - I'm not making any queries all right so
09:31 - our app bar is where we're gonna be
09:34 - working at for now so for all these SVG
09:40 - icons I suppose we're just going to take
09:45 - care of this with a media query Stephen
09:51 - says I should do a social drop-down
09:55 - that's interesting idea we'll think
09:58 - about that you say maybe like up in the
10:01 - corner here just have a small icon it
10:03 - can drop down I kind of yeah I'll think
10:08 - about that all right so let's add let's
10:20 - just add in a class here and let's go
10:36 - just uh only yeah let's call it desktop
10:41 - only I mean really this will probably
10:44 - end up being the case for oh no I can't
10:49 - do it in here I need this to be like in
10:54 - a media query I don't think we can do
11:01 - media queries in an object like this
11:04 - right well that's interesting I've I've
11:09 - never come across the the case where I
11:12 - need to make a media query when I was
11:13 - doing this that's really weird
11:17 - I wonder if I wonder if it's your UI has
11:25 - anything built in that I could be using
11:28 - before we make our own it would probably
11:32 - be I guess it would be the fastest just
11:37 - to make our own but I I do want to check
11:40 - oh all right Aniki says that's why I had
11:49 - trouble with mobile styles in that pull
11:51 - request no media queries all right well
11:57 - let's let's see what we can do
11:58 - I don't need pretty much any of this
12:03 - stuff right now
12:08 - I'm Seri lie let's see
12:18 - layouts hidden area here we are ok looks
12:25 - like we have some breakpoints release
12:28 - beta 34 break oh they're breaking
12:30 - changes in beta 30 alright cool
12:33 - off to check that out I open that in a
12:35 - new tab for now all the mounts are
12:40 - visible unless they are explicitly
12:41 - hidden universe' ranger grateful
13:24 - all right so they're bringing in
13:26 - importing hidden and then let's see what
13:30 - using it they're just wrapping hidden
13:34 - okay so wrapping the component and
13:37 - hidden so let's see I'll probably give
13:47 - the children will be hidden at or above
13:49 - we won't want the up we want it down
13:52 - probably most likely for what we're
13:54 - doing here
14:00 - so maybe medium and down
14:10 - then we double-check the live chat see
14:13 - if missing anything
14:17 - all right cool harsha do is mentioning
14:21 - that there's that hide component alright
14:23 - cool well let's let's do that let's grab
14:28 - our hidden will import hidden and bring
14:39 - it in up here oops I'm sorry this is so
14:42 - small I was working earlier so I had it
14:47 - really small sorry about that
14:52 - hopefully straining your eyes to see
14:54 - that tiny tiny text alright so now let's
14:59 - wrap something in hidden and see if it
15:03 - will work I may as well just copy what
15:07 - they did here so I'm gonna try medium
15:10 - and down I think that'll work
15:17 - I'm gonna move this over a bit we don't
15:19 - need it so let's see what this is to our
15:24 - icon I want that we went to title we
15:28 - went to logo and all this this whole
15:33 - grid well yeah everything within this
15:40 - grid I think we can get rid of so let me
15:47 - double check the grid here see where we
15:50 - had it yep so we can put hidden here and
15:56 - then down here sorry if I'm scrolling
15:59 - really fast I hope I didn't make anybody
16:02 - motion sick hidden woah oh it's just
16:09 - indentation we'll save it there we are
16:11 - okay let's see what happened
16:16 - wonderful okay that worked the the top
16:21 - have had really really thin I think it
16:26 - could use a bit of padding at the top
16:27 - but I mean that's it basically worked it
16:31 - did what we wanted to do now that I look
16:34 - at it if we keep the logo this size
16:37 - which I think is is fine that size works
16:40 - especially for a small screen then we
16:42 - may have some space over here I do want
16:47 - to check to see what this is 400 all
16:53 - right let me let me shrink this down a
16:56 - bit so if we dock dev tools here we can
17:05 - actually shrink the screen down a bit
17:07 - more so I think 320 is the smallest
17:11 - screen so that's about 320 yeah so if we
17:18 - were to add something in here it would
17:21 - definitely have to be something very
17:24 - small so I say I'm not gonna add
17:28 - anything for right now and we'll see
17:36 - later on at this point let's just keep
17:40 - it simple we need to launch this thing
17:42 - we can always add more in later on and
17:45 - the only thing that I'm thinking of is
17:48 - would it be better to Center this logo
17:51 - now that there's nothing over here or
17:53 - should we keep it aligned over here let
17:56 - me know in the live chat I'm not going
17:58 - to do anything with it now on a larger
18:00 - screen it definitely looks whoa all
18:05 - right okay so medium is all the way up
18:08 - there let's see it where that breakpoint
18:12 - you know what it doesn't the brief only
18:15 - doesn't just happen like normal and CSS
18:17 - so what is that 1212
18:26 - it's like 1280 or something is the
18:29 - breakpoint huh let's try to drop that
18:34 - down I think we might be able to drop
18:37 - down to the next breakpoint and it would
18:39 - still work so let me double check what
18:44 - that is called ASM so let's change it SM
18:59 - and oops alright let's see how far down
19:06 - this will go whoops okay yeah that
19:14 - definitely works that works okay I like
19:17 - that not that's a great point that's
19:19 - more around nine of what is that nine
19:23 - sixty nine ninety somewhere around there
19:26 - we're get another ninety yeah I think
19:28 - that's much more reasonable I don't
19:29 - think we could go any lower than that
19:32 - actually there's only one break point
19:34 - lower than that so I think that's that's
19:36 - really all we can do anyway but I think
19:38 - that's fine that's that's definitely
19:40 - acceptable really we definitely can't
19:45 - fit very many more options up here which
19:47 - is okay with me I don't want to clutter
19:48 - this up let's see what happens when we
19:50 - expand this
19:52 - all right good that still works let me
19:55 - shrink it down a bit more all right
19:57 - great
19:58 - so I don't I was worried we'd run into
20:00 - issues with expanding this but it looks
20:02 - like we have enough space awesome
20:06 - awesome
20:07 - all right cool so that that works now I
20:12 - do want to double check you know what we
20:16 - still have a little bit I can still
20:20 - scroll horizontally a bit so we have
20:23 - something else that's that's messing
20:25 - this up it wasn't just the the header
20:31 - visit this it's gotta be yeah it's gotta
20:35 - be this let's check this out
20:42 - hmm
20:48 - that's got some weird stuff going on
21:00 - all right well I'd say if we are going
21:06 - to have cards like this with that much
21:13 - text yeah we got to change it so
21:16 - internally these need to stack I suppose
21:26 - they either need to stack or these
21:30 - always need to be you know a hundred
21:34 - percent with if we get down lower
21:37 - something has to happen there I'm gonna
21:42 - check the live chat quickly just to see
21:45 - if if you all had any any advice all
21:54 - right I just want to take a moment to
21:59 - think about what I want to do with this
22:01 - type of thing I know we're gonna utilize
22:03 - these on the home page let's see all
22:10 - right so would it look better if we
22:12 - stack these so that the image was on top
22:15 - I don't know really know that I like a
22:19 - circular image on the top like that
22:31 - you know we may have to go we had just
22:36 - used the the existing I think it was a
22:39 - list component to do this and we just
22:41 - made one item in the list we may have to
22:44 - do something you know more custom to
22:48 - have some more control over this that
22:51 - probably went up being easier than
22:53 - trying to modify the list component
22:55 - directly
23:10 - yeah for now let's see if we go see how
23:19 - it looks when it's like this
23:31 - all right you know what I still really
23:33 - don't like that look so this type of
23:37 - card I think only looks alright the way
23:42 - we have it with just the right amount of
23:46 - tags just the right size I want to think
23:50 - of something a little more versatile for
23:53 - this because we needed to look good on
23:56 - different sizes rook says or Nikki says
24:11 - can you use shape outside CSS when it's
24:15 - a small card makes it look like
24:18 - magazines with text around an image oh
24:20 - that's a really good idea if we're gonna
24:24 - do that though I think we probably will
24:26 - have to make a custom card so let's
24:37 - I guess we could try that out
24:48 - yeah
24:59 - alright let's try it out let's I want to
25:04 - do something with this though as well on
25:07 - a smaller screens so it's I don't want
25:13 - it you know I'm like a screen this size
25:16 - I don't think it looks right to just
25:21 - have this all the way up against the
25:23 - edge like that so let's do something
25:28 - with this first I'm just kind of like
25:29 - working my way down so I don't want to
25:31 - skip this and go to the cars right now I
25:34 - mean we could we center this what is
25:43 - this is this
25:54 - yeah a text-align:center works yeah I
26:01 - mean that works good
26:09 - okay yeah text-align:center is fine for
26:12 - that it's nice when the answer is so
26:20 - simple alright so we're gonna put that
26:27 - oh I'm up in the app bar I need to go to
26:47 - let's close this index page
27:06 - here we are
27:10 - so here should we do it I guess we could
27:20 - make a clasp for it
27:28 - flex innocent 80 or things kind of well
27:34 - we could just add it onto here I mean
27:37 - this has a lot of really specific things
27:39 - so it's not like we're gonna reuse it so
27:43 - let's just add it onto here oops
27:50 - [Music]
27:51 - Center all right I'm gonna double check
28:00 - just to make sure I clear out anything
28:02 - in dev tools
28:07 - all right cool that works awesome all
28:14 - right now let's work our way down the
28:16 - page I want to try to remember to keep
28:18 - this small okay
28:31 - those buttons are an acceptable size
28:34 - there I think I can live with that
28:36 - yeah and this what size is this yeah
28:43 - this is just we're gonna need to do
28:46 - something with fonts as well I mean even
28:49 - on that this is like the simplest type
28:50 - of card you can make it's just a card
28:52 - with text on it
28:53 - even there we're leaking over the edges
28:56 - so more marius says why not use the
29:04 - mobile view simulator thingy I don't I
29:08 - don't like them okay
29:11 - be honest with you I do use it sometimes
29:13 - but I I'd like to do this better I like
29:20 - to just you know move this back and
29:22 - forth and see what happens so it does
29:26 - have its its uses but just not I don't
29:31 - know I like this better in case you're
29:35 - not sure what we're talking about we can
29:38 - toggle this mobile view and like we
29:44 - could change it and say like our let's
29:45 - check out an iPhone 4 right and this
29:48 - would be iPhone 4 view you can see what
29:51 - it would look like on our iPhone 4 click
29:55 - scroll you could change the you should
30:02 - be able to change mobile there was a
30:04 - button for like landscape mode and
30:06 - portrait mode I don't know what happened
30:10 - to that button seems like the UI for
30:14 - this has changed huh
30:23 - I for I don't know it doesn't really
30:29 - matter but anyway this is nice if you
30:31 - want to check it on a specific device
30:32 - and you don't have that device then
30:38 - anyway yeah Nikki says yeah you use the
30:42 - ability to play with it with good point
30:44 - I hadn't thought about it that way yet
30:46 - yeah yeah I mean it's just uh you know
30:50 - like this I can see like okay exactly
30:52 - the point where things shift that helps
30:56 - me especially if I'm trying to write
30:57 - media queries myself like I need to know
31:00 - the the real like pixel number exactly
31:03 - and I don't want to be switching trying
31:05 - to find phones that have that pixel
31:08 - value but it does really come in handy
31:12 - if you like if let's say you don't have
31:15 - something like browserstack where you
31:16 - can simulate phones you could use this
31:20 - and at least get you know something that
31:26 - could be useful all right my timer ran
31:29 - out so I'm gonna take a short break from
31:32 - coding now go to the live chat and
31:35 - answer some of your questions
31:58 - there's a question about what does the
32:01 - p5 d25 mean and it was answered in live
32:04 - chat but I just want to answer that
32:07 - again in case you're watching later on
32:09 - it's project 5 day 25 so I've tried I
32:13 - don't think I have it for every video
32:15 - but some of the early ones I didn't do
32:17 - this but for most of the videos it has
32:19 - what project it is and what day it is
32:22 - and I abbreviate it so we don't have
32:23 - really long titles but then that way if
32:27 - you want to go back and watch things
32:29 - like in order you can kind of easily
32:31 - tell what where we're at in the series
32:52 - Antonio says hi hey how's it going
32:55 - thanks for watching
33:15 - see
33:31 - all right it looks like Harsha and
33:34 - Marius is saying you can actually move
33:38 - back and forth in that mode let's check
33:40 - that up so it's not responsive mode oh
33:45 - nice
33:47 - I didn't know that I liked it yeah I
33:53 - like that
33:54 - then you could do this too oh-ho I
33:59 - actually really like that that's cool
34:05 - maybe I'll try this
34:07 - I'll try this mode out for the rest of
34:09 - the stream you all convince me I'm gonna
34:17 - do it I'm gonna try it out
34:30 - what
34:35 - do you see that what what is that veneer
34:45 - yeah these cards are not gonna work we
34:48 - we gotta redo those Wow
34:55 - that dog is just too cute all right well
35:03 - there wasn't really very many questions
35:05 - I kind of looked back into the live chat
35:08 - a lot more than I normally do so kept up
35:11 - with things so I guess I'll just we'll
35:13 - go back in here and let's I don't know
35:19 - get rid of these cards or you know make
35:23 - something else we had to do something
35:25 - about this because that's that's pretty
35:30 - bad we can also check on some of our
35:33 - interior pages I don't think there'll be
35:38 - a problem with the interior pages but
35:40 - you never know some of the mark-up that
35:42 - we're importing may have some weird
35:45 - stuff going on so it's worth we can
35:48 - obviously can't check every piece of
35:49 - content but maybe we could check you
35:53 - know one or two examples of each type
36:02 - let's see Nicki says that whitespace is
36:07 - caused by elements that are taken out of
36:09 - the document flow like position:absolute
36:11 - elements that that could make sense
36:16 - because we're using you know masonry so
36:21 - that is still in positioning absolute
36:26 - but the element itself looks fine it's
36:29 - just the the insides of it that are
36:33 - getting messed up
36:38 - alright let's take a closer look at
36:40 - what's going on now
36:44 - Wow harsh it already has eight tasks
36:48 - done in the JavaScript AF API repo if if
36:53 - you all want to check out what's going
36:55 - on with that project it's in my
36:56 - repositories so the stuff we I do for
36:59 - work is in the fu s marcom organization
37:01 - if you check my profile just I think
37:04 - it's Jesse or Weigel that's where the
37:07 - the new stuff is
37:16 - harsh janessa says you need standard J s
37:19 - and the repo yeah I'd like to do it just
37:23 - like we set up our projects here you
37:25 - know like prettier husky standard J s
37:28 - uzs lint think what else we do I mean
37:35 - obviously we want to use testing so I'd
37:38 - like to keep it you know keep it the
37:40 - same and then depending on how it goes
37:43 - with using committees in I think we we
37:47 - might want to use that as well I want to
37:50 - make it as easy as possible for people
37:52 - to contribute but also keep everything
37:57 - you know the same in terms of style I
38:02 - think it'll just make it a lot easier
38:05 - oh look ask for n Grogg sorry sorry
38:15 - Nicki I totally forgot about Endre let
38:18 - me get that up and running for you all
38:19 - so if you haven't seen me use this
38:24 - before if you click this link that I
38:26 - just paste it into the live chat you can
38:29 - see this website as we're working on it
38:32 - and you can go into dev tools just like
38:38 - like I'm knowing and check everything
38:40 - out all right is this the this is the
38:48 - container
38:53 - I wonder if we mess with overflow let's
38:58 - mess with the overflow alright so let's
39:01 - see if we can I mean we can do something
39:12 - like this which at least should prevents
39:15 - what should prevent all this weirdness
39:17 - from happening but then we don't see any
39:20 - of the content so that's not an ideal
39:23 - and it fixes one problem it makes
39:25 - another so we may end up putting that on
39:32 - there just in case something weird
39:34 - happens and content sticks out so it
39:36 - doesn't mess up the whole page it just
39:38 - messes up that piece of content John
39:42 - Ensign says hey Oh watch this lady your
39:44 - busy day here oh hey John thanks for
39:46 - stepping checking in alright so it looks
39:57 - like let me take this off for a second
40:00 - so we can see area
40:19 - yet let's rebuild this card
40:30 - all right we're gonna rebuild the card
40:33 - we want to make a card then that we
40:44 - could probably do with making the font a
40:45 - little smaller
40:54 - he
41:01 - so really this is what we came from and
41:04 - we just made it really big so I wouldn't
41:11 - want to shrink this down to that size
41:13 - just to make it fit
41:28 - he
41:31 - I actually I don't even remember what I
41:33 - did to change this so let's go in and
41:36 - see what we did so should be should
41:42 - still be in the index and remember we
41:45 - hard-coded a bunch of these cards in
41:47 - here we're not gonna leave it like this
41:53 - so it looks a little crazy now but this
41:57 - will all get taken care of
42:02 - so YouTube embeds where's there we are
42:11 - okay alright so we gave it an avatar big
42:17 - in list item text big all right let's
42:22 - check it out you know what I gave this
42:29 - this avatar a fixed width and height
42:34 - which that's that's an issue
42:42 - hmm
42:54 - hmm
43:04 - I guess we could try to shrink this
43:21 - hmm
43:34 - I'm really I'm really kind of undecided
43:37 - here
43:55 - John Anson says 100% with four cards get
43:58 - rid of image
44:39 - right now that I look at this I mean it
44:42 - won't fix our problem but it'll help do
44:44 - we really need this much margin on the
44:48 - sides where are we getting all that
44:53 - margin from oh because I put the margin
45:01 - in okay
45:16 - under what we had before I mean that's
45:22 - that's definitely more acceptable see
45:25 - what it looks like on a larger screen
45:52 - yeah I am I think I'm going to remove
46:00 - that margin for that padding I mean
46:06 - sorry let's make sure that that is he
46:09 - record yeah let's take that out all
46:14 - right this will give us a little bit
46:16 - more realistic picture of how much space
46:18 - we have to deal with all right so as
46:24 - expected we still have this issue maybe
46:27 - we could just and this is a I think what
46:33 - John was saying is yeah this is what
46:38 - John was saying let's just get rid of
46:41 - the image on small screens what so I
46:48 - mean let's see what it looks like
46:57 - yeah I mean this looks exactly how I
47:01 - wanted it to look and expected it to
47:03 - look when it has enough space but say
47:10 - probably anything beyond this so was it
47:17 - nine
47:20 - let's try small and down let's hide this
47:24 - one's falling down if we can and I'll be
47:32 - realistically we're gonna have more text
47:35 - than this
47:46 - let's go on the site now and and find a
47:49 - comparable piece of content just to get
47:51 - a realistic view of how much text is
47:55 - gonna be in these cars
48:21 - so slow I Wow all right so right now we
48:34 - aren't giving more information we just
48:35 - have a little quote I guess with a link
48:42 - okay will quote with a link let's see if
48:49 - we have I think we do have let's check
48:58 - these pages I know somewhere in the site
49:04 - we have little sections like that that
49:06 - with the picture and text the islands
49:11 - check the accounting department see
49:12 - what's here all right so this is how
49:16 - we're doing this student 1 so this is
49:22 - the amount of text that we have and but
49:29 - we still have a read more link all right
49:35 - then we have a bigger profile
49:42 - all right so I guess we're fine we can
49:44 - deal with just having this amount of
49:46 - text it seems like we are just using a
49:50 - link to get people you know we just have
49:53 - a small amount of text okay
50:00 - all right Nikki Nikki see you later
50:03 - thanks for watching thanks for all your
50:05 - help okay then a thermo timer yeah I did
50:15 - all right I suppose then what we could
50:23 - try to do is have have the fonts an
50:33 - image then just get smaller for a small
50:37 - screen
50:48 - let's just try that at first this is one
50:51 - of those things where I I hate I think
50:54 - I've already spent too much time on it
50:57 - because no matter what I do here
50:59 - it could change dramatically when I
51:02 - actually start showing it to people here
51:05 - where I work and get different ideas so
51:07 - I think I'm just kind of stressing over
51:12 - you know really unnecessarily at this
51:15 - point but let's let's go in here the the
51:20 - big thing is I need to be able to change
51:22 - these classes based on a break point so
51:28 - let's see we're in mom it's here you
51:30 - like the area so I don't need hidden I
51:36 - need these break points though
51:53 - heeey
52:26 - all right that's interesting this is
52:29 - kind of our problem here
52:38 - alright I'll keep that in mind
52:45 - alright responsive breakpoints wonderful
52:56 - see how this works
53:15 - whoa
53:18 - very cool I had no idea there were
53:20 - breakpoints built into here all right
53:23 - let's try it out so we are going to
53:34 - within Syria
53:50 - maybe avatar so within this avatar big
53:56 - let's go
54:07 - pain breakpoints now small let's drop
54:11 - this down to 100 and let's drop this
54:17 - down to
54:34 - let's just let's get 24 all right see if
54:37 - that works
54:38 - I've never tried to do breakpoints with
54:40 - material UI oh all right
54:46 - pretty cool let's all right so we go
54:52 - not bad not bad
55:07 - Wow
55:12 - all right it still there's some spots
55:15 - where it's a little weird a lot weird
55:19 - why is it still there I thought this
55:22 - breakpoint was a lot oh because we have
55:26 - it going like this
55:38 - oops keep going the wrong way let's see
55:42 - where we have this ever
55:48 - [Music]
56:00 - I'm gonna try like this and see what
56:03 - difference that makes - so let's see we
56:10 - go to this point
56:18 - oops I did it on the wrong thing alright
56:23 - so what I'm trying to do here is let me
56:29 - search for there yeah
56:36 - search for Thomas crow this is my boss
56:38 - by the way and here I'm gonna change
56:44 - this to medium and that should help make
56:51 - things look a little better okay yeah
56:55 - there we are so this is always gonna be
56:58 - all the way across until we get up to a
57:03 - more reasonable size alright so here
57:08 - yeah not bad not that bad not perfect
57:13 - but I think that's way more acceptable
57:16 - than it was before it looked obviously
57:18 - broken now I think it looks okay we
57:23 - still have you know I can't zoom in in
57:27 - here I'm gonna switch this up and toggle
57:34 - back to this you so I can zoom in so we
57:36 - still have this white area even on large
57:41 - screens we have this white area and we
57:46 - can so even on large screens I I have a
57:52 - horizontal scrollbar over so like this
57:58 - shouldn't happen see this site does not
58:00 - have a horizontal scrollbar all right
58:06 - let me check my time three minutes if
58:11 - anybody has any idea why I have a
58:13 - horizontal scrollbar still please let me
58:16 - know in the live chat I know I've had
58:17 - this same thing happened to me on
58:19 - various projects throughout the years I
58:21 - don't know why I can't remember what the
58:25 - problem was before
58:29 - all right so usually when this happens I
58:33 - just go through and try to see which
58:36 - elements are sticking out see it there
58:46 - doesn't appear to be any let's go to the
58:50 - top
58:58 - Dave says start removing elements vishal
59:02 - says hello a lot of love from india hey
59:05 - Vishal thanks for joining us I have a
59:12 - lot of love for India as well I have
59:14 - quite a few of you from India that that
59:17 - watched the show I mean based on the
59:18 - analytics I think number one is from the
59:20 - United States number two most viewers
59:23 - thinker from the UK and then after that
59:26 - is India then I really appreciate it
59:30 - because I know the time zone because of
59:32 - the time difference sometimes things can
59:34 - be crazy for the live stream let's start
59:39 - opening up some of these header all
59:46 - right let's go
59:55 - do we
59:57 - all right so it's not in the header
60:00 - let's check the footer the weight not in
60:10 - the footer so at least we know it's in
60:13 - the main main place here all right so we
60:20 - can check
60:33 - let's just get rid of this hero section
60:37 - oh it's in the hero section awesome
60:44 - alright let's refresh this and get to
60:46 - hero section back now he can go in Dave
60:52 - thank you so much for that that was so
60:55 - helpful Dave suggested that I just start
60:58 - removing elements and that was way
61:02 - faster than what I was initially trying
61:04 - to do all right so where's our header or
61:08 - I'm sorry I hear a section here here's
61:10 - our hero section
61:11 - let's see where it's where it's at
61:13 - what's going on
61:31 - there we are it's right here
61:48 - I thought it was that pairing
61:53 - yeah but it's not the padding it still
61:56 - does that
61:56 - well I have this set on Macs with just
62:02 - forgotten soon
62:07 - see what's inside of here as well all
62:10 - right it's nothing inside it's
62:12 - definitely this alright my timer did run
62:18 - out but I really him so close I really
62:21 - want to figure this out before we end
62:22 - the stream let me go to computed see
62:30 - where I'm getting my width from all
62:36 - right looks like it's calculated I'm
62:44 - just gonna start removing Stiles
62:46 - I already tried removing the padding
62:48 - that didn't do anything
63:08 - it's crazy
63:11 - it's got to be padding
63:20 - whoa-oh
63:25 - let's go up on here with
63:43 - all right maybe I added this
63:47 - let's see where that's coming from
64:19 - now let me actually look at this
64:31 - you know a grid container alright so is
64:40 - it this one yeah
64:53 - yeah but
65:01 - was it this grid container
65:16 - oh no the screens freezing shoes let me
65:23 - know is it freezing for everybody what's
65:25 - what's going on but so anyway I think I
65:36 - found the problem it's with this grid
65:38 - right here this grid container
65:55 - I'm not sure what to do about that so
65:59 - I'm getting some Styles applied here
66:26 - here mmm grid type container so it's not
66:31 - that it's a type container it's a
66:33 - spacing
66:34 - it's a spacing one
66:45 - special issue system
67:04 - maybe I'm not gonna be able to use grid
67:12 - for just two
67:32 - see if I can just override it
67:42 - what all right that fixed it alright so
67:50 - I'm not sure what was going on with that
67:53 - but I just put an inline style which
67:59 - would override the other styles and made
68:03 - a width of 100% let me move the screen
68:08 - about a little bit just to make sure
68:10 - that thinks they'll work no I'll never
68:15 - see a screen that small what am I
68:16 - thinking
68:17 - let's get its feet more reasonable here
68:21 - all right all right cool so that was
68:27 - another really easy fix I'm gonna keep
68:30 - trying to work within like the material
68:33 - you I you know documentation but
68:37 - sometimes it's just so easy to fix it
68:43 - with a little in lifestyle so now
68:45 - normally if we are gonna reuse this
68:46 - component a lot of places I might think
68:48 - twice about doing that but this is the
68:51 - hero section it's only gonna exist on
68:54 - the front page so I'm gonna do it once
68:57 - and it's it's only gonna have to be once
68:59 - if I end up having a similar problem on
69:01 - other pages then maybe we can dig deeper
69:04 - and look into it but I think that was a
69:06 - pretty simple fix so at this point at
69:10 - least the home page now doesn't have any
69:15 - glaring layout errors on mobile so
69:22 - mission accomplished for today let's
69:27 - commit this and put it up to github so
69:34 - let's go get status get status and
69:43 - looks good yeah that's what we wanted to
69:45 - check I had the yarn lock updated from
69:48 - when I was bringing merging pool
69:51 - requests earlier all right so I want to
69:57 - use this new this new thing that Nicky
70:02 - put in here what is it commit is in so
70:06 - let's see how I use this all right so
70:11 - let's try yarn run cm
70:25 - oops I forgot to get it get a yarn see
70:33 - em alright so now when we do committin
70:38 - you can see I can just move up and down
70:40 - with my arrow keys and select what kind
70:43 - of commit I want to do so
71:00 - I mean maybe a fix
71:08 - all right let's do a fix component or
71:13 - file name we could do at bar
71:26 - in short imperative tense description I
71:29 - would say
71:45 - horizontal scroll the skin let's see
73:06 - all right so I just wanted to like do a
73:09 - large example here but I don't expect
73:11 - you all to write out that much if you
73:14 - want to you know if you want to make a
73:21 - commit message in fact like the long
73:24 - message I don't need that at all in the
73:27 - commit
73:28 - I mean odds are you're going to be
73:29 - submitting a pull request and you're
73:31 - gonna put the description in your pull
73:35 - request but basically probably the first
73:40 - part right what kind of commit this is
73:42 - and then the third part a short
73:45 - description that's all you really need
73:47 - the other stuff does help but it's not
73:51 - mandatory
73:54 - no breaking changes no I don't think so
74:01 - we have any issues I don't think we have
74:04 - the issue up and for that
74:05 - alright cool now it's gonna run all its
74:08 - auto formatting linting and testing I
74:13 - kind of hope it doesn't pass the test
74:15 - just so we can see an example of what
74:17 - happens but I think it will
74:29 - cool with past greats now we can do get
74:33 - push origin and everything is now on the
74:39 - repo on github let's see Harshit says
74:45 - merge my PR as well Harshit is that your
74:49 - PR is there PR for this repo there you
74:55 - mean for what is it the JavaScript AF
75:11 - all right I'm just merging it right now
75:14 - from the command line or I'm sorry from
75:16 - github
75:30 - all right I should I merged it
75:38 - I didn't bother checking it out because
75:41 - literally we had nothing in the project
75:43 - I just had a readme a contributing MD
75:49 - file did I even have that I had to read
75:52 - me a license and maybe a contributing
75:55 - file and that was it so obviously
76:01 - whatever Asha does is not gonna break it
76:06 - okay so now that we've got that
76:11 - accomplished I'm gonna go to the live
76:13 - chat get through all the questions read
76:15 - out some comments so if you have
76:16 - anything you want me to answer or
76:20 - anybody else on the lab have to answer
76:22 - please put it in there now let me scroll
76:26 - to the top
76:50 - someone in the lab chat said they are
76:52 - high AF if you don't know what that
76:56 - means
76:56 - good for you if you do know what that
76:59 - means don't do drugs that's the public
77:03 - service announcement today from me um
77:07 - I'm not not sure I'll let this person I
77:11 - think that's it I think it's all day
77:13 - they said and didn't make any more
77:15 - comments got to see not really a lot of
77:27 - questions
77:33 - all right Louise says hi Jesse is this a
77:37 - project that you're building the same as
77:40 - the one on fu s Markham Franciscan react
77:44 - on github yeah yeah this is it this is
77:47 - that project and now that we've
77:50 - committed the changes and push them up
77:51 - to github it should be it's exactly the
77:54 - same everything I have on my machine is
77:56 - the same as what's on on github
78:16 - Anmol says do we really need a degree to
78:19 - get a web app developer job you do not
78:21 - you don't need a degree it probably
78:25 - depends a lot on what the what things
78:27 - are like in your particular country or
78:29 - wherever you're trying to get a job as
78:30 - to whether it's kind of customary to
78:33 - have a degree or not but here in the
78:35 - United States if you're trying to get a
78:37 - job with a tech company or maybe a small
78:40 - startup having a degree is definitely
78:43 - not mandatory it's possible that it
78:47 - could help you if you have some sort of
78:50 - undergraduate degree but it's it's not
78:54 - mandatory most of the jobs that I see
78:58 - they don't mention education at all they
79:02 - just want to know your skills are but I
79:04 - do see some that require some sort of
79:06 - degree

80:00 - using electron to make desktop apps so
80:04 - depending on what you're interested in
80:06 - you could work on those as well usually
80:09 - I'll just create issues for these
80:10 - different repositories you can find
80:13 - links in the descriptions for the repos
80:14 - and you could just take one of those
80:19 - issues try to work on it submit a pull
80:21 - request if you want if you'd rather not
80:24 - you know contribute code but you just
80:26 - like to contribute advice and help in
80:28 - the live chat that's that's excellent
80:30 - too if you want more info about that you
80:34 - know ask more questions here or you can

80:43 - missing some other way to contribute I
80:45 - mean really help helping answer
80:46 - questions and things the live chat and
80:49 - then work and/or contributing code or
80:52 - probably the main ways
81:04 - Harshit says might clone the repo as
81:07 - well I have a feeling that you haven't
81:10 - cloned that you mean the repo I just
81:13 - made yeah I haven't cloned that repo yet
81:17 - I created it in github and didn't clone
81:22 - it yet all right I've got another the
81:29 - end of the live chat this was
81:31 - surprisingly short live chat today

81:39 - to do which is awesome
81:42 - I always appreciate that help okay we
81:46 - got Evo says have you ever done
81:49 - something with with Go Go laying I'm
81:52 - currently thinking about doing some big
81:56 - scale data processing and looking at
81:57 - some solutions currently unfortunately I
82:00 - have no experience with it so wish I
82:03 - could be more help but I I know almost
82:06 - nothing about it

82:39 - so I'm not exactly sure what we'll be
82:41 - working on but I'm definitely not gonna
82:42 - broadcast me migrating data cuz that's
82:44 - super boring maybe we'll have some new
82:48 - types of pages that will work on
82:50 - depending on how much data I get over
82:52 - but until then have a wonderful day

Cleaned transcript:

everybody welcome to life coding with Jessie today we're gonna get back to work on the main website for Franciscan the University I work for sorry I was a few minutes late I turn it on the stream and I started dropping frames so let me know how the video is I tried turning off a few a few programs that I was working with earlier that I don't need so hopefully hopefully everything will work I was just looking to see if there's anything else I could turn off I don't think I can all right looks like the videos fine hey everybody alright so a little update on some of the projects I think I have for the catechetical Institute site for now I think everything's completed I'm just waiting on some content before I make those changes live I hope that comes in soon because we also updated all our packages and some of those packages that are currently on there are pretty old so I'd love to move to the new updated branch as soon as I can the stuff for the bulletin if you remember I've been talking about the university bulletin that I think is it's like you have to log in to get into it which i think is unnecessary but basically they're still going to be a login so that's not gonna change for now but we made it a little bit easier and was it yesterday stream I think we made it easier to get in so I think that'll be fine it'll take care of most of the issues that some of the users were having and the JavaScript AF site works being done on that so javascript sir that was in here yesterday is doing some design work building out a little bit of the the front end and just some basic HTML Harshit is working on the the server or the api so maybe we'll have something to see with that you know maybe hopefully soon I'm not gonna be able to work that much on it because this projects gonna take up a ton of my time I'm preparing to you know work over over my normal amount of time on this this morning I was just doing a lot of migrating data and who looks like the stream cut the black for a second is it all right now all right cool so anyway I was trying to migrate a bunch of data and some like my eyes are just so dry after staring at the the screen and anyway I'm glad to get back to doing some like frontend work my coworkers are looking in the door alright so let me check the live chat quickly just to say hello and see if there's any questions I should answer right away and then I'll show my screen and we'll get started let's see all right looks like a strange fun for most of you Stephen says today Jesse will be discussing beard care and the two buttons shirt rule ready go I did have my beard trimmed up a little bit when I got a haircut so it's freighting less scruffy than normal all right okay harsh it's adding commits to the PR I'll check out those PRS after the stream alright let's switch it up okay let me start my timer and we'll bring over our projects so I have updated this project this Franciscan react is the repo name I've updated this project too based on the pool request and I don't think there's any outstanding pool requests right now that are completed so I shouldn't we should be up to date I'm gonna double check though yep all the pool requests are in alright so some of the additions we have are the search the search animation works here which is awesome and I believe we went over yeah we went over this I mean yesterday I have some additions here we have a different color here so pretty good I'm happy about that and the pool requests were mainly so rook or nikki has added that search toggle and also those links that we just saw on the drawer also added committees in so when we go to do a commit I'm gonna try out this new way we're doing commits that should help have like a standard for for committing to get so we'll see how that works I think it'll be it'll take some getting used to at first but in the long run it should be should be better all right if I missed any PRS I'm sorry let me know and I'll I will give you credit for any PRS let's see let's see probably five days all right just doublechecking the lights out again so today we want to fix some stuff with the mobile the mobile view I'd mention maybe yesterday that it looks I hadn't kept in mind at all the the mobile view of this and I I don't know why because we should be thinking mobile first based on the audience which is going to be primarily teenagers so today we're gonna try to clean this up and have it be acceptable for mobile I mean you can see right now this is just I think it's just ridiculous so bad and that's I mean that's my fault Wow okay let's start up here with with the header first thing I'd like to do is really remove all of this I'm just gonna remove everything for the mobile version of the header the only thing I might even consider keeping is a call to action but I don't think I'll keep that a thing I'm just gonna get rid of get rid of all of it and then see how it looks if it looks like we might have space to add anything in maybe but we'll check it out we'll see how it goes I'm not worried about the links right so we have all the links here so mobile users aren't missing out on anything they'll snowball the same content the only thing that'll be missing is you know this access fus and button and then these social icons maybe we can add those in here somewhere we'll see I could maybe access fus yeah we'll see maybe we'll add them in the side but first things first let's just get them out of here all right so oops wrong code so let's check up I don't need this right now do we need to let's keep the drawer up I'm not making any queries all right so our app bar is where we're gonna be working at for now so for all these SVG icons I suppose we're just going to take care of this with a media query Stephen says I should do a social dropdown that's interesting idea we'll think about that you say maybe like up in the corner here just have a small icon it can drop down I kind of yeah I'll think about that all right so let's add let's just add in a class here and let's go just uh only yeah let's call it desktop only I mean really this will probably end up being the case for oh no I can't do it in here I need this to be like in a media query I don't think we can do media queries in an object like this right well that's interesting I've I've never come across the the case where I need to make a media query when I was doing this that's really weird I wonder if I wonder if it's your UI has anything built in that I could be using before we make our own it would probably be I guess it would be the fastest just to make our own but I I do want to check oh all right Aniki says that's why I had trouble with mobile styles in that pull request no media queries all right well let's let's see what we can do I don't need pretty much any of this stuff right now I'm Seri lie let's see layouts hidden area here we are ok looks like we have some breakpoints release beta 34 break oh they're breaking changes in beta 30 alright cool off to check that out I open that in a new tab for now all the mounts are visible unless they are explicitly hidden universe' ranger grateful all right so they're bringing in importing hidden and then let's see what using it they're just wrapping hidden okay so wrapping the component and hidden so let's see I'll probably give the children will be hidden at or above we won't want the up we want it down probably most likely for what we're doing here so maybe medium and down then we doublecheck the live chat see if missing anything all right cool harsha do is mentioning that there's that hide component alright cool well let's let's do that let's grab our hidden will import hidden and bring it in up here oops I'm sorry this is so small I was working earlier so I had it really small sorry about that hopefully straining your eyes to see that tiny tiny text alright so now let's wrap something in hidden and see if it will work I may as well just copy what they did here so I'm gonna try medium and down I think that'll work I'm gonna move this over a bit we don't need it so let's see what this is to our icon I want that we went to title we went to logo and all this this whole grid well yeah everything within this grid I think we can get rid of so let me double check the grid here see where we had it yep so we can put hidden here and then down here sorry if I'm scrolling really fast I hope I didn't make anybody motion sick hidden woah oh it's just indentation we'll save it there we are okay let's see what happened wonderful okay that worked the the top have had really really thin I think it could use a bit of padding at the top but I mean that's it basically worked it did what we wanted to do now that I look at it if we keep the logo this size which I think is is fine that size works especially for a small screen then we may have some space over here I do want to check to see what this is 400 all right let me let me shrink this down a bit so if we dock dev tools here we can actually shrink the screen down a bit more so I think 320 is the smallest screen so that's about 320 yeah so if we were to add something in here it would definitely have to be something very small so I say I'm not gonna add anything for right now and we'll see later on at this point let's just keep it simple we need to launch this thing we can always add more in later on and the only thing that I'm thinking of is would it be better to Center this logo now that there's nothing over here or should we keep it aligned over here let me know in the live chat I'm not going to do anything with it now on a larger screen it definitely looks whoa all right okay so medium is all the way up there let's see it where that breakpoint you know what it doesn't the brief only doesn't just happen like normal and CSS so what is that 1212 it's like 1280 or something is the breakpoint huh let's try to drop that down I think we might be able to drop down to the next breakpoint and it would still work so let me double check what that is called ASM so let's change it SM and oops alright let's see how far down this will go whoops okay yeah that definitely works that works okay I like that not that's a great point that's more around nine of what is that nine sixty nine ninety somewhere around there we're get another ninety yeah I think that's much more reasonable I don't think we could go any lower than that actually there's only one break point lower than that so I think that's that's really all we can do anyway but I think that's fine that's that's definitely acceptable really we definitely can't fit very many more options up here which is okay with me I don't want to clutter this up let's see what happens when we expand this all right good that still works let me shrink it down a bit more all right great so I don't I was worried we'd run into issues with expanding this but it looks like we have enough space awesome awesome all right cool so that that works now I do want to double check you know what we still have a little bit I can still scroll horizontally a bit so we have something else that's that's messing this up it wasn't just the the header visit this it's gotta be yeah it's gotta be this let's check this out hmm that's got some weird stuff going on all right well I'd say if we are going to have cards like this with that much text yeah we got to change it so internally these need to stack I suppose they either need to stack or these always need to be you know a hundred percent with if we get down lower something has to happen there I'm gonna check the live chat quickly just to see if if you all had any any advice all right I just want to take a moment to think about what I want to do with this type of thing I know we're gonna utilize these on the home page let's see all right so would it look better if we stack these so that the image was on top I don't know really know that I like a circular image on the top like that you know we may have to go we had just used the the existing I think it was a list component to do this and we just made one item in the list we may have to do something you know more custom to have some more control over this that probably went up being easier than trying to modify the list component directly yeah for now let's see if we go see how it looks when it's like this all right you know what I still really don't like that look so this type of card I think only looks alright the way we have it with just the right amount of tags just the right size I want to think of something a little more versatile for this because we needed to look good on different sizes rook says or Nikki says can you use shape outside CSS when it's a small card makes it look like magazines with text around an image oh that's a really good idea if we're gonna do that though I think we probably will have to make a custom card so let's I guess we could try that out yeah alright let's try it out let's I want to do something with this though as well on a smaller screens so it's I don't want it you know I'm like a screen this size I don't think it looks right to just have this all the way up against the edge like that so let's do something with this first I'm just kind of like working my way down so I don't want to skip this and go to the cars right now I mean we could we center this what is this is this yeah a textaligncenter works yeah I mean that works good okay yeah textaligncenter is fine for that it's nice when the answer is so simple alright so we're gonna put that oh I'm up in the app bar I need to go to let's close this index page here we are so here should we do it I guess we could make a clasp for it flex innocent 80 or things kind of well we could just add it onto here I mean this has a lot of really specific things so it's not like we're gonna reuse it so let's just add it onto here oops Center all right I'm gonna double check just to make sure I clear out anything in dev tools all right cool that works awesome all right now let's work our way down the page I want to try to remember to keep this small okay those buttons are an acceptable size there I think I can live with that yeah and this what size is this yeah this is just we're gonna need to do something with fonts as well I mean even on that this is like the simplest type of card you can make it's just a card with text on it even there we're leaking over the edges so more marius says why not use the mobile view simulator thingy I don't I don't like them okay be honest with you I do use it sometimes but I I'd like to do this better I like to just you know move this back and forth and see what happens so it does have its its uses but just not I don't know I like this better in case you're not sure what we're talking about we can toggle this mobile view and like we could change it and say like our let's check out an iPhone 4 right and this would be iPhone 4 view you can see what it would look like on our iPhone 4 click scroll you could change the you should be able to change mobile there was a button for like landscape mode and portrait mode I don't know what happened to that button seems like the UI for this has changed huh I for I don't know it doesn't really matter but anyway this is nice if you want to check it on a specific device and you don't have that device then anyway yeah Nikki says yeah you use the ability to play with it with good point I hadn't thought about it that way yet yeah yeah I mean it's just uh you know like this I can see like okay exactly the point where things shift that helps me especially if I'm trying to write media queries myself like I need to know the the real like pixel number exactly and I don't want to be switching trying to find phones that have that pixel value but it does really come in handy if you like if let's say you don't have something like browserstack where you can simulate phones you could use this and at least get you know something that could be useful all right my timer ran out so I'm gonna take a short break from coding now go to the live chat and answer some of your questions there's a question about what does the p5 d25 mean and it was answered in live chat but I just want to answer that again in case you're watching later on it's project 5 day 25 so I've tried I don't think I have it for every video but some of the early ones I didn't do this but for most of the videos it has what project it is and what day it is and I abbreviate it so we don't have really long titles but then that way if you want to go back and watch things like in order you can kind of easily tell what where we're at in the series Antonio says hi hey how's it going thanks for watching see all right it looks like Harsha and Marius is saying you can actually move back and forth in that mode let's check that up so it's not responsive mode oh nice I didn't know that I liked it yeah I like that then you could do this too ohho I actually really like that that's cool maybe I'll try this I'll try this mode out for the rest of the stream you all convince me I'm gonna do it I'm gonna try it out what do you see that what what is that veneer yeah these cards are not gonna work we we gotta redo those Wow that dog is just too cute all right well there wasn't really very many questions I kind of looked back into the live chat a lot more than I normally do so kept up with things so I guess I'll just we'll go back in here and let's I don't know get rid of these cards or you know make something else we had to do something about this because that's that's pretty bad we can also check on some of our interior pages I don't think there'll be a problem with the interior pages but you never know some of the markup that we're importing may have some weird stuff going on so it's worth we can obviously can't check every piece of content but maybe we could check you know one or two examples of each type let's see Nicki says that whitespace is caused by elements that are taken out of the document flow like positionabsolute elements that that could make sense because we're using you know masonry so that is still in positioning absolute but the element itself looks fine it's just the the insides of it that are getting messed up alright let's take a closer look at what's going on now Wow harsh it already has eight tasks done in the JavaScript AF API repo if if you all want to check out what's going on with that project it's in my repositories so the stuff we I do for work is in the fu s marcom organization if you check my profile just I think it's Jesse or Weigel that's where the the new stuff is harsh janessa says you need standard J s and the repo yeah I'd like to do it just like we set up our projects here you know like prettier husky standard J s uzs lint think what else we do I mean obviously we want to use testing so I'd like to keep it you know keep it the same and then depending on how it goes with using committees in I think we we might want to use that as well I want to make it as easy as possible for people to contribute but also keep everything you know the same in terms of style I think it'll just make it a lot easier oh look ask for n Grogg sorry sorry Nicki I totally forgot about Endre let me get that up and running for you all so if you haven't seen me use this before if you click this link that I just paste it into the live chat you can see this website as we're working on it and you can go into dev tools just like like I'm knowing and check everything out all right is this the this is the container I wonder if we mess with overflow let's mess with the overflow alright so let's see if we can I mean we can do something like this which at least should prevents what should prevent all this weirdness from happening but then we don't see any of the content so that's not an ideal and it fixes one problem it makes another so we may end up putting that on there just in case something weird happens and content sticks out so it doesn't mess up the whole page it just messes up that piece of content John Ensign says hey Oh watch this lady your busy day here oh hey John thanks for stepping checking in alright so it looks like let me take this off for a second so we can see area yet let's rebuild this card all right we're gonna rebuild the card we want to make a card then that we could probably do with making the font a little smaller he so really this is what we came from and we just made it really big so I wouldn't want to shrink this down to that size just to make it fit he I actually I don't even remember what I did to change this so let's go in and see what we did so should be should still be in the index and remember we hardcoded a bunch of these cards in here we're not gonna leave it like this so it looks a little crazy now but this will all get taken care of so YouTube embeds where's there we are okay alright so we gave it an avatar big in list item text big all right let's check it out you know what I gave this this avatar a fixed width and height which that's that's an issue hmm hmm I guess we could try to shrink this hmm I'm really I'm really kind of undecided here John Anson says 100% with four cards get rid of image right now that I look at this I mean it won't fix our problem but it'll help do we really need this much margin on the sides where are we getting all that margin from oh because I put the margin in okay under what we had before I mean that's that's definitely more acceptable see what it looks like on a larger screen yeah I am I think I'm going to remove that margin for that padding I mean sorry let's make sure that that is he record yeah let's take that out all right this will give us a little bit more realistic picture of how much space we have to deal with all right so as expected we still have this issue maybe we could just and this is a I think what John was saying is yeah this is what John was saying let's just get rid of the image on small screens what so I mean let's see what it looks like yeah I mean this looks exactly how I wanted it to look and expected it to look when it has enough space but say probably anything beyond this so was it nine let's try small and down let's hide this one's falling down if we can and I'll be realistically we're gonna have more text than this let's go on the site now and and find a comparable piece of content just to get a realistic view of how much text is gonna be in these cars so slow I Wow all right so right now we aren't giving more information we just have a little quote I guess with a link okay will quote with a link let's see if we have I think we do have let's check these pages I know somewhere in the site we have little sections like that that with the picture and text the islands check the accounting department see what's here all right so this is how we're doing this student 1 so this is the amount of text that we have and but we still have a read more link all right then we have a bigger profile all right so I guess we're fine we can deal with just having this amount of text it seems like we are just using a link to get people you know we just have a small amount of text okay all right Nikki Nikki see you later thanks for watching thanks for all your help okay then a thermo timer yeah I did all right I suppose then what we could try to do is have have the fonts an image then just get smaller for a small screen let's just try that at first this is one of those things where I I hate I think I've already spent too much time on it because no matter what I do here it could change dramatically when I actually start showing it to people here where I work and get different ideas so I think I'm just kind of stressing over you know really unnecessarily at this point but let's let's go in here the the big thing is I need to be able to change these classes based on a break point so let's see we're in mom it's here you like the area so I don't need hidden I need these break points though heeey all right that's interesting this is kind of our problem here alright I'll keep that in mind alright responsive breakpoints wonderful see how this works whoa very cool I had no idea there were breakpoints built into here all right let's try it out so we are going to within Syria maybe avatar so within this avatar big let's go pain breakpoints now small let's drop this down to 100 and let's drop this down to let's just let's get 24 all right see if that works I've never tried to do breakpoints with material UI oh all right pretty cool let's all right so we go not bad not bad Wow all right it still there's some spots where it's a little weird a lot weird why is it still there I thought this breakpoint was a lot oh because we have it going like this oops keep going the wrong way let's see where we have this ever I'm gonna try like this and see what difference that makes so let's see we go to this point oops I did it on the wrong thing alright so what I'm trying to do here is let me search for there yeah search for Thomas crow this is my boss by the way and here I'm gonna change this to medium and that should help make things look a little better okay yeah there we are so this is always gonna be all the way across until we get up to a more reasonable size alright so here yeah not bad not that bad not perfect but I think that's way more acceptable than it was before it looked obviously broken now I think it looks okay we still have you know I can't zoom in in here I'm gonna switch this up and toggle back to this you so I can zoom in so we still have this white area even on large screens we have this white area and we can so even on large screens I I have a horizontal scrollbar over so like this shouldn't happen see this site does not have a horizontal scrollbar all right let me check my time three minutes if anybody has any idea why I have a horizontal scrollbar still please let me know in the live chat I know I've had this same thing happened to me on various projects throughout the years I don't know why I can't remember what the problem was before all right so usually when this happens I just go through and try to see which elements are sticking out see it there doesn't appear to be any let's go to the top Dave says start removing elements vishal says hello a lot of love from india hey Vishal thanks for joining us I have a lot of love for India as well I have quite a few of you from India that that watched the show I mean based on the analytics I think number one is from the United States number two most viewers thinker from the UK and then after that is India then I really appreciate it because I know the time zone because of the time difference sometimes things can be crazy for the live stream let's start opening up some of these header all right let's go do we all right so it's not in the header let's check the footer the weight not in the footer so at least we know it's in the main main place here all right so we can check let's just get rid of this hero section oh it's in the hero section awesome alright let's refresh this and get to hero section back now he can go in Dave thank you so much for that that was so helpful Dave suggested that I just start removing elements and that was way faster than what I was initially trying to do all right so where's our header or I'm sorry I hear a section here here's our hero section let's see where it's where it's at what's going on there we are it's right here I thought it was that pairing yeah but it's not the padding it still does that well I have this set on Macs with just forgotten soon see what's inside of here as well all right it's nothing inside it's definitely this alright my timer did run out but I really him so close I really want to figure this out before we end the stream let me go to computed see where I'm getting my width from all right looks like it's calculated I'm just gonna start removing Stiles I already tried removing the padding that didn't do anything it's crazy it's got to be padding whoaoh let's go up on here with all right maybe I added this let's see where that's coming from now let me actually look at this you know a grid container alright so is it this one yeah yeah but was it this grid container oh no the screens freezing shoes let me know is it freezing for everybody what's what's going on but so anyway I think I found the problem it's with this grid right here this grid container I'm not sure what to do about that so I'm getting some Styles applied here here mmm grid type container so it's not that it's a type container it's a spacing it's a spacing one special issue system maybe I'm not gonna be able to use grid for just two see if I can just override it what all right that fixed it alright so I'm not sure what was going on with that but I just put an inline style which would override the other styles and made a width of 100% let me move the screen about a little bit just to make sure that thinks they'll work no I'll never see a screen that small what am I thinking let's get its feet more reasonable here all right all right cool so that was another really easy fix I'm gonna keep trying to work within like the material you I you know documentation but sometimes it's just so easy to fix it with a little in lifestyle so now normally if we are gonna reuse this component a lot of places I might think twice about doing that but this is the hero section it's only gonna exist on the front page so I'm gonna do it once and it's it's only gonna have to be once if I end up having a similar problem on other pages then maybe we can dig deeper and look into it but I think that was a pretty simple fix so at this point at least the home page now doesn't have any glaring layout errors on mobile so mission accomplished for today let's commit this and put it up to github so let's go get status get status and looks good yeah that's what we wanted to check I had the yarn lock updated from when I was bringing merging pool requests earlier all right so I want to use this new this new thing that Nicky put in here what is it commit is in so let's see how I use this all right so let's try yarn run cm oops I forgot to get it get a yarn see em alright so now when we do committin you can see I can just move up and down with my arrow keys and select what kind of commit I want to do so I mean maybe a fix all right let's do a fix component or file name we could do at bar in short imperative tense description I would say horizontal scroll the skin let's see all right so I just wanted to like do a large example here but I don't expect you all to write out that much if you want to you know if you want to make a commit message in fact like the long message I don't need that at all in the commit I mean odds are you're going to be submitting a pull request and you're gonna put the description in your pull request but basically probably the first part right what kind of commit this is and then the third part a short description that's all you really need the other stuff does help but it's not mandatory no breaking changes no I don't think so we have any issues I don't think we have the issue up and for that alright cool now it's gonna run all its auto formatting linting and testing I kind of hope it doesn't pass the test just so we can see an example of what happens but I think it will cool with past greats now we can do get push origin and everything is now on the repo on github let's see Harshit says merge my PR as well Harshit is that your PR is there PR for this repo there you mean for what is it the JavaScript AF all right I'm just merging it right now from the command line or I'm sorry from github all right I should I merged it I didn't bother checking it out because literally we had nothing in the project I just had a readme a contributing MD file did I even have that I had to read me a license and maybe a contributing file and that was it so obviously whatever Asha does is not gonna break it okay so now that we've got that accomplished I'm gonna go to the live chat get through all the questions read out some comments so if you have anything you want me to answer or anybody else on the lab have to answer please put it in there now let me scroll to the top someone in the lab chat said they are high AF if you don't know what that means good for you if you do know what that means don't do drugs that's the public service announcement today from me um I'm not not sure I'll let this person I think that's it I think it's all day they said and didn't make any more comments got to see not really a lot of questions all right Louise says hi Jesse is this a project that you're building the same as the one on fu s Markham Franciscan react on github yeah yeah this is it this is that project and now that we've committed the changes and push them up to github it should be it's exactly the same everything I have on my machine is the same as what's on on github Anmol says do we really need a degree to get a web app developer job you do not you don't need a degree it probably depends a lot on what the what things are like in your particular country or wherever you're trying to get a job as to whether it's kind of customary to have a degree or not but here in the United States if you're trying to get a job with a tech company or maybe a small startup having a degree is definitely not mandatory it's possible that it could help you if you have some sort of undergraduate degree but it's it's not mandatory most of the jobs that I see they don't mention education at all they just want to know your skills are but I do see some that require some sort of degree ayyyy bows here hey Eva how's it going davus how can I be part of this Dave you can you do as much as you want in terms of you know checkout the repos so we have we have a lot of projects going on right now mostly react stuff we have this react project is our main thing project that we're working on and that's what we'll be talking about here on the streams for at least another month but we also have a react native project and we have a react project where we're using electron to make desktop apps so depending on what you're interested in you could work on those as well usually I'll just create issues for these different repositories you can find links in the descriptions for the repos and you could just take one of those issues try to work on it submit a pull request if you want if you'd rather not you know contribute code but you just like to contribute advice and help in the live chat that's that's excellent too if you want more info about that you know ask more questions here or you can message me on some social media platform whatever you want but that's it I'm missing some other way to contribute I mean really help helping answer questions and things the live chat and then work and/or contributing code or probably the main ways Harshit says might clone the repo as well I have a feeling that you haven't cloned that you mean the repo I just made yeah I haven't cloned that repo yet I created it in github and didn't clone it yet all right I've got another the end of the live chat this was surprisingly short live chat today mostly because there weren't a lot of questions there's a lot of discussion during the chat about what we were going to do which is awesome I always appreciate that help okay we got Evo says have you ever done something with with Go Go laying I'm currently thinking about doing some big scale data processing and looking at some solutions currently unfortunately I have no experience with it so wish I could be more help but I I know almost nothing about it so if anyone else here knows more about go please let ebo know but yeah I I have no idea it's alright so that's the last question here I today's all right yeah today's Thursday so I should be back tomorrow maybe sometime around noon 100 p.m. something like that and that's my time Eastern Sun and we're gonna come right back here and be working on something else I'll I will be busy migrating data so I'm not exactly sure what we'll be working on but I'm definitely not gonna broadcast me migrating data cuz that's super boring maybe we'll have some new types of pages that will work on depending on how much data I get over but until then have a wonderful day
