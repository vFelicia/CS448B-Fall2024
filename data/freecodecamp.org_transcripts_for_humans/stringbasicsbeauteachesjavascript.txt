00:00 - a string or string literal is a series
00:03 - of zero or more characters enclosed in
00:05 - single or double quotes
00:12 - there is the string of my name which is
00:15 - bow
00:16 - if you need a quote character in your
00:17 - string you can escape a quote from
00:20 - considering it as an end of a string
00:22 - quote by placing a backslash in front of
00:25 - the quote
00:26 - so here let me show you that
00:32 - so here i made a string
00:34 - and it's he said hi
00:36 - so if that's going to look like this he
00:39 - said hi
00:40 - when you put a backslash in front of the
00:42 - quote character the program knows that
00:44 - you're not trying to end the string
00:45 - you're just trying to use the quote
00:47 - character in the string
00:49 - string values in javascript may be
00:51 - written with single or double quotes so
00:54 - so long as you start and end with the
00:56 - same type of quote
00:57 - you don't have to escape a quote
00:58 - character as long as it is a different
01:00 - type of quote character than what is
01:02 - surrounding your string
01:03 - so what you could do you can make this
01:05 - sentence one again you can not escape
01:08 - these quote characters
01:10 - and you can put a single quote
01:12 - at the end and at the beginning
01:17 - okay
01:18 - there are also other characters you need
01:20 - to escape which means to put a backslash
01:22 - in front in order to use them as a
01:24 - string
01:25 - so they have backslash single quote
01:27 - that's how you do the single quote
01:28 - here's how you do the double quote
01:30 - whenever you want to backslash in a
01:31 - string you just do two backslashes the
01:34 - first backslash is the escape character
01:36 - you can also put in a new line a
01:38 - carriage return a tab a backspace and a
01:42 - form feed
01:44 - you can concatenate or put two strings
01:46 - together with the plus operator
01:52 - so here it's going to put two strings
01:54 - together it's going to look like this
01:58 - and it's basically just going to be one
01:59 - string that has my name beau carnes and
02:02 - watch out for spaces concatenation does
02:04 - not add spaces between concatenated
02:06 - strings so you have to add them yourself
02:09 - that's why i have the space after the
02:10 - word bow
02:12 - you can also concatenate strings and
02:14 - variables
02:18 - so that would just be my name is beau
02:22 - carnes this is who my name is and it's
02:24 - going to add the full name which is this
02:25 - variable up here another way to
02:27 - concatenate strings is use is using the
02:30 - plus equals operator like this
02:35 - so the plus equals operator means that
02:38 - you are going to start with this
02:40 - variable and then add this to the end of
02:43 - the variable it really means full name
02:46 - equals full name plus is my name
02:50 - so the full name variable is now going
02:53 - to be
02:55 - so that's what the full name variable is
02:57 - going to be now the final thing i want
02:58 - to tell you about strings is that in
03:00 - javascript string values are immutable
03:03 - which means they cannot be altered once
03:05 - created now you can assign a variable to
03:08 - a new string but you can't actually
03:10 - change the original string we have
03:12 - sentence twice
03:13 - you so you can assign sentence to a new
03:15 - string but you can't actually change the
03:18 - original string like arrays you can
03:20 - change an element in the array but you
03:22 - can't change a character in the string
03:24 - after you create it
03:25 - thanks for watching my name is beau

Cleaned transcript:

a string or string literal is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes there is the string of my name which is bow if you need a quote character in your string you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of a string quote by placing a backslash in front of the quote so here let me show you that so here i made a string and it's he said hi so if that's going to look like this he said hi when you put a backslash in front of the quote character the program knows that you're not trying to end the string you're just trying to use the quote character in the string string values in javascript may be written with single or double quotes so so long as you start and end with the same type of quote you don't have to escape a quote character as long as it is a different type of quote character than what is surrounding your string so what you could do you can make this sentence one again you can not escape these quote characters and you can put a single quote at the end and at the beginning okay there are also other characters you need to escape which means to put a backslash in front in order to use them as a string so they have backslash single quote that's how you do the single quote here's how you do the double quote whenever you want to backslash in a string you just do two backslashes the first backslash is the escape character you can also put in a new line a carriage return a tab a backspace and a form feed you can concatenate or put two strings together with the plus operator so here it's going to put two strings together it's going to look like this and it's basically just going to be one string that has my name beau carnes and watch out for spaces concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings so you have to add them yourself that's why i have the space after the word bow you can also concatenate strings and variables so that would just be my name is beau carnes this is who my name is and it's going to add the full name which is this variable up here another way to concatenate strings is use is using the plus equals operator like this so the plus equals operator means that you are going to start with this variable and then add this to the end of the variable it really means full name equals full name plus is my name so the full name variable is now going to be so that's what the full name variable is going to be now the final thing i want to tell you about strings is that in javascript string values are immutable which means they cannot be altered once created now you can assign a variable to a new string but you can't actually change the original string we have sentence twice you so you can assign sentence to a new string but you can't actually change the original string like arrays you can change an element in the array but you can't change a character in the string after you create it thanks for watching my name is beau carnes don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
