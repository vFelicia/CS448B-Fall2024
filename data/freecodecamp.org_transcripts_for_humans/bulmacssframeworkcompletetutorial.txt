00:00 - hey welcome to my Bommel course before
00:02 - we get started I first want to make sure
00:04 - that you're familiar with scrim ba scrim
00:06 - bow is this interactive platform that
00:07 - you're using you can record and edit
00:10 - other people's screencasts and see the
00:11 - changes in real times if I have a
00:13 - website here you can actually copy edit
00:16 - the code say let's say hello Roma save
00:21 - it and then that will be reflected in
00:22 - the browser so everything that I do here
00:25 - you can do it as well or copied and save
00:27 - it as your own all right this is my
00:29 - beaumont course and in it you're gonna
00:31 - learn how to use MoMA MoMA is a modern
00:34 - CSS framework from Jeremy Thomas who
00:36 - goes by Jake Adams it's based on flexbox
00:39 - and using MoMA we can describe our
00:41 - websites design using just classes
00:43 - flexbox is a newer CSS spec that makes
00:46 - sectioning and aligning more natural we
00:49 - don't need to know flexbox but it is how
00:51 - boma works behind the scenes and when I
00:53 - say classes what I mean is that instead
00:55 - of writing around a CSS per element you
00:58 - can use it predefined classes this is
01:00 - really what the bulk of boma is and with
01:02 - enough classes we can describe our
01:04 - websites design using just semantics
01:06 - so before we deconstruct what that means
01:09 - take a look at the icons that you see
01:11 - below with OMA we can prototype columns
01:13 - form elements components modifiers
01:16 - layout elements and elements themselves
01:18 - the way that we interact with a boma is
01:20 - first we use this template this is the
01:23 - standard template that you would use
01:25 - when you start to author any MoMA
01:26 - website I've added one line of code and
01:29 - this is so that we can understand our
01:31 - website it's just a CSS debugger if you
01:35 - want to enable it you can just uncomment
01:37 - this line and see that it looks a bit
01:39 - different we'll use that to make sure
01:41 - that our website is designed perfectly
01:45 - other than that this is where bulma is
01:48 - getting linked to our website and then
01:50 - this these are font awesome icons this
01:53 - will load it up into your website okay
01:55 - we were talking about classes before
01:57 - this area right over here
01:58 - well boma is styling classes for us and
02:01 - with enough classes we can make a really
02:03 - robust and response website this for
02:06 - example would create the website that
02:08 - I've been showing you so far which
02:10 - already out of the box is responsive
02:13 - doesn't mean a lot so far but it will
02:14 - going forward okay this is a boma
02:18 - website and it's one of the three
02:20 - websites that we're going to learn to
02:21 - make in these screencasts this is what
02:23 - it would look like on a mobile device
02:25 - and on the right a tablet device whereas
02:27 - this was the desktop and then we're
02:30 - going to learn how to make a beautiful
02:31 - blog I already created a course for this
02:34 - but this one will be using boma and will
02:36 - take a fraction of the time
02:37 - instead of 40 minutes you'll be able to
02:39 - do this in maybe 15 or so minutes then
02:43 - after that we're gonna make a launch
02:45 - page for a product here I've recreated
02:48 - the Tesla Roadster page this is not the
02:50 - actual page it's just my version of it
02:52 - it is responsive and that's how it would
02:54 - look on a mobile and a tablet device
02:56 - alright so this is pretty exciting stuff
02:58 - if you have any questions or comments
03:00 - you want to reach out to me you can
03:01 - click my face reach out to me on Twitter
03:03 - otherwise I think we're ready to get
03:05 - started alright I'll see you in the next
03:07 - screencast where we'll first build this
03:09 - website and then that will slowly turn
03:11 - into this one all right I'll see you
03:14 - there
03:19 - hey welcome back so in this screencast
03:21 - we're going to turn this website into
03:24 - this one this actually is a website and
03:26 - then we'll use this as a base to add
03:29 - some complexity and make it a bit
03:30 - prettier until we get all the way back
03:32 - up to our original slide which again is
03:34 - responsive so on a mobile device this
03:38 - and then as a tablet on the right
03:40 - alright so how do we begin just to start
03:43 - let me point out that we have a few
03:44 - folders and files ready to go I have our
03:47 - images that we use across all of our
03:49 - websites and then I have some of almost
03:51 - documentation this is by no means all of
03:54 - boma this is maybe 10 or 15% if I had to
03:57 - guess might be much less than that
03:59 - but the point is that way Poma works is
04:01 - that we have our classes and these
04:03 - classes usually follow some HTML
04:05 - contract and that means that our boma is
04:08 - pretty idiomatic and that another boma
04:10 - developer could look at our website and
04:12 - just by looking at these contracts
04:14 - understand our website so looking at our
04:17 - website this is the first thing that we
04:19 - see and in our code we have a section a
04:22 - better component that we could use
04:24 - instead of a section is a hero so
04:26 - section is more generic whereas hero
04:28 - signifies it's important it's the first
04:31 - thing that we see so now we don't have
04:35 - very much let's go ahead and look at the
04:37 - debugger and we can see that the element
04:42 - is occupying just a portion but by no
04:44 - means all the height so what we can do
04:46 - is hero has a modifier called is full
04:49 - height modifiers allowed to just modify
04:52 - some other class and in this case is
04:54 - full height is limited to hero you can't
04:57 - use it everywhere we're also going to
04:59 - add another modifier as background black
05:03 - turning off our debugger okay so often
05:07 - when you want to put something inside of
05:09 - a hero or a section you put a container
05:15 - we can see that the container is trying
05:18 - to create a space for us to put some
05:20 - content okay and then in our container
05:23 - I'm going to add a image so we're gonna
05:27 - add the image contract and put that
05:31 - right in here you might be wondering why
05:35 - do we need to specify the dimension what
05:37 - can happen is that the website will
05:39 - resize itself because the images are
05:41 - loading and images can occupy a
05:43 - different height when they're unloaded
05:44 - as opposed to when they are loaded and
05:46 - so to avoid this behavior you can just
05:48 - specify what the dimensions are so there
05:51 - are predefined dimensions but you can
05:53 - also use an aspect ratio if you need
05:55 - more generalized dimensions now in this
05:58 - case we don't actually need this because
06:00 - our website is so simple right and then
06:02 - we'll swap out image source with our
06:04 - actual logo so say voila or the light
06:07 - which was in here right there and then
06:10 - that's in our images folder so we're
06:14 - almost there we definitely need to
06:16 - constrain the width so I'll just add X
06:19 - width and we'll say maybe 512 pixels all
06:24 - right and then last we want to Center it
06:25 - so here I'm going to add a style tag
06:28 - this is how we can interpolate our own
06:31 - CSS with homeless or create a center
06:34 - class which is just a generic centering
06:36 - class and then justify content is for
06:41 - the horizontal centering so we do use
06:43 - Center as the value and then align items
06:45 - is for the vertical centering the center
06:48 - class will Center whatever element is
06:50 - inside of it so we'll go up one element
06:53 - and we'll put it in here and it's
06:56 - centered we'll turn off the debugger and
07:00 - now we have a responsive website albeit
07:04 - pretty boring that's it for this one in
07:07 - the next one we are going to add some
07:09 - columns and make it a bit more like an
07:11 - actual website all right I'll see you in
07:13 - the next screencast
07:19 - hey welcome back so this is the state of
07:22 - our website it's terrible and what we
07:25 - can do to make it a bit better we're
07:26 - going to add a section so this is the
07:28 - hero at the tops the first thing that
07:30 - you see underneath we have a section and
07:33 - so we pretty much know how to do that
07:34 - we'll add the columns class and then
07:36 - three columns
07:37 - now we'll add some text and then we're
07:39 - on our way first things first let's go
07:42 - to our Docs and then get these section
07:46 - that right here so let's get rid of our
07:49 - is full height see how that looks and
07:53 - then let's make these size a bit smaller
07:56 - so I'll reduce it by a factor of two
08:00 - it cool looks good and then now we're
08:04 - gonna add some columns they'll go back
08:07 - to the moment dock and then here's
08:10 - columns okay so we'll just put that
08:12 - there
08:14 - turn on the debugger and then let's take
08:16 - a look so we have a column a single
08:19 - column occupying pretty much the full
08:21 - containers with what if we had two
08:23 - columns it's pretty smart here and it
08:27 - can figure this out for us we don't
08:28 - actually need to state how many columns
08:30 - we desire we can pretty much just put it
08:32 - right in here so we know that we're
08:35 - going to have three so I'll just add one
08:37 - more and then we can add in some text
08:44 - and then we'll turn off the debugger
08:50 - it's not quite the same so what's going
08:52 - on you can see that there is an area
08:54 - around the text but the text here is
08:57 - occupying pretty much the full column
09:00 - there's no padding there's no margin
09:01 - let's take a closer look
09:04 - alright there's no gap so what's going
09:07 - on well what we can do is can add a
09:09 - container inside of here but instead of
09:11 - container when you use what's called a
09:14 - notification in a notification will give
09:16 - it this sort of gray style that you see
09:18 - here so we're going to wrap the text in
09:20 - a notification class
09:25 - and see that it's got some area around
09:28 - it now
09:32 - yeah all right looks good all right
09:37 - looks great now what's so cool about
09:39 - flexbox and boma and all this stuff is
09:42 - that it can do a lot of the heavy
09:44 - lifting for us so here's what I mean
09:46 - if I resize or it's already responsive
09:50 - we didn't actually need to do very much
09:52 - to do that and you're here responsive
09:54 - design you have to have media queries
09:56 - and then you have to understand how
09:57 - everything connects to each other but
09:59 - boma understands these ideas and pretty
10:01 - much takes out the labor for us so
10:04 - that's awesome it's optimized for
10:06 - tablets desktops and mobile devices out
10:08 - of the box now I want to point out that
10:10 - notification can be modified just like
10:13 - we used has background black before you
10:15 - can use other modifiers so for example I
10:17 - can do is primary and take a look how
10:21 - the text is white and the background is
10:23 - green whereas over here the text is
10:25 - black and the background is gray all
10:28 - right now the last thing is if we want
10:30 - to control the text we can add a
10:32 - modifier so we'll need to wrap this in
10:35 - its own paragraph is size so we can do
10:41 - you like is three and you can see it got
10:44 - really really big so much that it's
10:46 - overwhelming believe there's one through
10:48 - seven and what we use for now is five so
10:52 - just a bit bigger and that's it in the
10:58 - next screencast when I add those is
11:00 - primary and some others to make this
11:03 - really beautiful and then add a title
11:05 - for each of these columns all right I'll
11:07 - see you in the next screencast
11:14 - hey welcome back so this is the state of
11:17 - a website not bad but we're gonna
11:20 - improve it with some color so it'll look
11:21 - like this by the time that we're
11:23 - finished which I think looks a lot
11:24 - better so how do we do that how do we go
11:26 - from here there all right so we know we
11:28 - need to remove the background make this
11:31 - the color logo because that is a
11:32 - different one than it is here and then
11:34 - we can give the columns their own
11:37 - background and then add a title and then
11:39 - add a color to our notification all
11:42 - right so that is pretty straightforward
11:44 - okay so like we mentioned we'll get rid
11:46 - of the has background black it'll
11:50 - default to a white but now our logo is
11:53 - invisible so we can go to our images and
11:56 - then we're gonna swap out the white one
11:57 - for this one alright just like that nice
12:02 - that's a bit big so let's change that
12:05 - max width
12:08 - so now we don't have a partition between
12:11 - our hero and the section to make that
12:13 - more obvious let me point that out with
12:15 - the debugger so here we can see that
12:18 - there's a beginning and an end to the
12:20 - hero and the section to make that more
12:22 - obvious we need to add a color that's
12:24 - why this one looks a bit different so
12:29 - we'll go to section I'm gonna add has
12:31 - background and I'm gonna use light for
12:35 - this nice so now we have a problem we
12:39 - can't see our column from the section
12:42 - right we need to be able to separate
12:45 - these two so what we can do is add a
12:47 - modifier to our notification right here
12:50 - we can do is and then of the available
12:53 - ones we have I think there's info is
12:56 - linked and you have danger warning and
12:59 - primary right so these would all happen
13:01 - is before them so let's see what they
13:03 - look like just turning off the deep
13:07 - bugger
13:08 - so yeah link gives us a nice blue - feel
13:12 - free to experiment with these I'm going
13:14 - to use is info is primary and then is
13:17 - warning now let's really cool about
13:21 - using these thematic modifiers is they
13:23 - actually modify more than just the
13:25 - background take a look at the text the
13:27 - text has now altered firm black to white
13:29 - depending on which theme we're using so
13:31 - this is a really nice feature of OMA
13:33 - well we'll inverse the text in this case
13:36 - to make sure that it's readable if we
13:38 - force this to be a has text white right
13:42 - here
13:44 - it's not as readable as before so this
13:48 - is one of the things that boma is doing
13:49 - for us behind the scenes that I think is
13:51 - really cool now we only need to add a
13:53 - title so what we can do is we're going
13:55 - to add an H element so do h1 and then
13:58 - we'll do what was it oh yeah almost the
14:00 - first one and that does not look good
14:04 - that looks so inferior all right so
14:07 - let's attribute this so right now it's
14:09 - not getting anything from MoMA because
14:12 - it doesn't have a class so I'm going to
14:14 - give it a say title now we get something
14:17 - that stands out that's a bit big so I
14:19 - add a modifier to per title and we'll do
14:22 - is size to do I think one less yeah that
14:26 - looks good that's pretty quick right so
14:33 - Roma is doing a lot of the work for us
14:35 - now we're ready to move on to adding the
14:38 - columns that you see beneath all right
14:40 - I'll see you in the next screencast
14:47 - hey welcome back so our website looks
14:49 - like this which is alright I mean it's a
14:52 - bit boring but what we can do is
14:53 - beautify it so we're gonna give it some
14:55 - pecans and then another section and then
14:57 - that section will have its own cut icons
14:59 - that have a color and then the title and
15:01 - the paragraph will hug each other here
15:03 - so how do we do this
15:04 - we're gonna go to the boma documentation
15:07 - and we're gonna grab two classes we need
15:09 - the media class which is like a Facebook
15:13 - post or a Twitter post
15:15 - and then we need to grab the actual icon
15:18 - class which is here all right and I'm
15:23 - going to put that right in here we have
15:27 - our media left which is this area over
15:29 - here and then inside of it we need to
15:31 - put the icon class which is what we did
15:33 - here okay and then our content well we
15:36 - already have content it's here so we're
15:38 - just going to insert that right here and
15:43 - that's really it so let's go ahead and
15:47 - refactor this combine our notification
15:50 - with the media class so we'll do media
15:52 - notification and then all we need to do
15:55 - is we'll make this article this article
15:58 - and then we'll get rid of this guy
16:03 - alright so let's see how this looks got
16:08 - the wrong icon but it's a start the icon
16:10 - that will actually use is this one and I
16:13 - didn't memorize that that is coming from
16:14 - an awesome com so that's where we get
16:16 - the codes for the font awesome icons and
16:19 - we don't want this to have a color so we
16:21 - can just get rid of that for now our
16:23 - icon is appearing as white because of
16:26 - his info and that's pretty interesting
16:30 - if I put is warning the icon goes black
16:33 - that's a really nice feature to make the
16:35 - icon bigger we can add a modifier here
16:37 - let's say FA LG for large and you also
16:41 - have 2x and then every X and there's
16:44 - probably more so with you 2x for now I
16:47 - think that's the right size yeah that
16:49 - looks really good now if you want it to
16:51 - have more of an area around the icon
16:53 - I'll show you what I mean yeah that box
16:56 - is like really narrow it doesn't have
16:57 - that sort of nice area around it an easy
17:00 - way to fix that is we can add a modifier
17:02 - to the icon class of is medium or as
17:06 - large or try it as large yeah so that
17:10 - red definitely makes a difference and
17:12 - then let's turn off the bugger so it's a
17:16 - bit big let's just make that is medium
17:19 - instead cool yeah so that's really all
17:23 - there is to making this a media class
17:26 - who's gonna paste in the results pepper
17:32 - use act code that we wrote before just
17:34 - copied and pasted and yeah the rest of
17:37 - it is really the same thing so let's go
17:39 - ahead and just take all of this copy and
17:41 - paste it again
17:46 - all right and we know that we're gonna
17:47 - have six instead of three so we're gonna
17:51 - repeat the column so instead we have six
17:53 - columns and that does not look good so
17:57 - we need to fix this how do we how do we
18:00 - fix that so we can add a few things for
18:03 - every column we need to say it's one
18:05 - third there's a whole bunch of modifiers
18:07 - in use here we're gonna use is one third
18:09 - and then this will basically force each
18:11 - column to occupy one third of the
18:14 - website's width so we just repeat that
18:16 - process and then let's see how that
18:21 - looks
18:23 - all right that's a bit better but it's
18:25 - definitely on at the same line which is
18:27 - not ideal hope you had another modifier
18:30 - called
18:31 - is multi-line and then this will force
18:33 - it to break Thanks
18:35 - now you probably know what to do here
18:37 - right what do we what's left we can get
18:40 - rid of the background for the whole
18:42 - section the notification doesn't need to
18:45 - have a color now it's great okay so
18:49 - let's just go ahead and force that so we
18:51 - say it has that ground white in our
18:56 - paragraph to make these hug to make this
18:58 - hug the title you can just give the
19:00 - class of subtitle now finally we're just
19:04 - gonna make this a little smaller and
19:06 - then get rid of this space around the
19:08 - icon we can give it a color by doing has
19:14 - text let's say warning I'm gonna go and
19:18 - paste in the results and then we'll load
19:20 - that up and what up it's really that
19:23 - cool and it's all responsive which is
19:26 - really amazing because we didn't we
19:28 - didn't even need to code that right one
19:30 - was doing all of this for us so bomb was
19:32 - really incredible at rapidly prototyping
19:34 - and shipping websites quickly and then
19:37 - coming up we're going to learn how to on
19:39 - the blog I'll see you in the next
19:41 - screencast
19:47 - hey welcome back so you just finished
19:49 - your first Bulma website and that's
19:51 - really amazing just how much fun looking
19:53 - new for you you think about it you did
19:55 - responsive beautiful website design
19:57 - without even touching was it any CSS
20:00 - like it was it's like for hot it's like
20:03 - five lines of CSS so bomb was really a
20:06 - powerhouse here and understanding and
20:08 - mastering boma can really I mean the
20:11 - thing is even if you don't use boa in
20:12 - production it can teach you how Jeremy
20:15 - or Jake Adams might solve a problem
20:16 - using boma and I think that's pretty
20:18 - amazing all right let's start up our new
20:21 - website this is going to be a blog and
20:23 - to start you'll note that we have this
20:25 - little breadcrumb at the top so let's go
20:27 - ahead and paste that in one of the
20:29 - components that we can use is the bread
20:32 - crumb so it's right here note that we're
20:34 - starting with the section in the
20:35 - container if we're not starting with the
20:37 - hero it makes sense that we would start
20:38 - with a section instead alright so put
20:41 - that right here and then let's take a
20:43 - look and it doesn't do anything because
20:48 - it's empty so I'm just filling with
20:50 - values
20:53 - all right so that looks really great now
20:55 - let's go ahead and open it up and it's
20:58 - okay but in our design here the contents
21:01 - pretty narrow so how do we how do we
21:03 - change that so I couldn't find a hundred
21:05 - percent idiomatic way to do this with
21:07 - bulma's so instead I relied on CSS grid
21:09 - so now we're going to learn how to embed
21:12 - CSS grid into boma and so here's what we
21:15 - can do create a grid class which
21:18 - requires it need display grid then when
21:21 - a template three columns because you can
21:23 - imagine that this website is really just
21:25 - three columns the container is the
21:28 - reason that this doesn't go all the way
21:29 - to the edge of the web page that's why
21:31 - we have a gap here but if we just ignore
21:33 - that gap we basically have a small
21:35 - column a bigger column and then a
21:37 - another small column over here well what
21:40 - we can do
21:41 - grid template columns and we're going to
21:45 - divide our website into thirds to start
21:47 - so we've new one if our one if our one
21:49 - fr fr stands for a fraction unit so now
21:52 - our websites being divided into thirds
21:54 - anywhere we put the grid class this one
21:57 - okay now we need to be pretty explicit
21:59 - here because if we just use grid as it
22:02 - is the content will fall into this
22:04 - column so because almost always the
22:06 - content falls into this column we just
22:09 - need to be explicit about that you
22:11 - belong to the second before the third
22:14 - column I want the content to start here
22:17 - and then end here so the syntax is two
22:20 - over three and then we can just put the
22:24 - grid here because of our content is
22:27 - inside of this div we put the grid here
22:30 - and the asterisk is referring to
22:33 - anything inside of the grid that would
22:35 - include this nav that will inherit this
22:38 - grid com rule okay so we go ahead and
22:40 - load this up our websites divided into
22:42 - thirds now with the content occupying
22:44 - just the center column it's a bit too
22:46 - narrow so what we can do instead is
22:47 - we'll give this a fixed width all right
22:51 - that's great
22:51 - and let's turn on the debugger so if we
22:55 - make this responsive oh and I forgot it
22:58 - off right there okay all right so
23:01 - looking with the debugger see this
23:03 - little these white lines right here well
23:05 - that's because our column
23:06 - is too wide on a mobile device it can't
23:09 - be 624 pixels that might be wider than
23:12 - the screen and say this is a responsive
23:15 - column with a minimum and a maximum
23:17 - width anywhere from 0 to 624 pixels so
23:21 - now you'll note that we don't get that
23:23 - side effect so that's great all right
23:25 - how we how do we get these bigger images
23:28 - if you look on a mobile device you'll
23:30 - note that they occupy the full width
23:32 - whereas on a desktop device
23:34 - it's just occupying most of the width so
23:37 - remember the reason we have this gap
23:38 - here is because of the container given
23:41 - that what's called this column medium
23:44 - and I can update this it's really
23:46 - amazing that grid is that subtle and
23:48 - then now if I wanted to refer to all
23:50 - three columns which is pretty much what
23:52 - this design is these images are spanning
23:55 - all three columns then I'll just create
23:57 - another identifier and then here I'll
24:00 - use Excel okay and then to use our new
24:05 - excel identifiers I need to create a
24:07 - class so that we can give a specific
24:09 - element say for example nav occupy all
24:12 - three columns and not just the the
24:14 - center medium column
24:16 - so now I wanted our nav to occupy all
24:19 - three columns I can just give it the
24:21 - class of grid Excel wait a minute what's
24:26 - what's going on we've got this gap right
24:27 - here well that's actually boma trying to
24:30 - help us out almost trying to make
24:31 - everything pretty but in this case it's
24:33 - adding padding and we don't want it it's
24:35 - interrupting the design what we can do
24:37 - this would new is padding less here so
24:41 - this tells the section to not have its
24:43 - own padding there we go
24:44 - right now it's occupying all three so
24:47 - that's great and let's go ahead and turn
24:49 - this off and now it's just occupying the
24:53 - the content column it looks like we can
24:55 - keep the vertical padding it's just the
24:57 - horizontal padding that that we don't
24:58 - care for so let's go ahead and make our
25:01 - own class because it doesn't exist in
25:03 - Omaha but we'll just make it real quick
25:04 - so we say is padding less horizontal
25:06 - we'd say padding left I mean right right
25:13 - okay and then let's see what happens
25:15 - oh I just realized we mistyped hang on
25:21 - okay it's better now all right so we
25:24 - created the class and now it's occupying
25:26 - the full width which is really really
25:28 - what we want we want to have a hundred
25:29 - percent control of the layout in this
25:32 - case now we're gonna have a problem
25:35 - which is our content doesn't hug the
25:37 - wall but our image does ooh how do we do
25:40 - with that well it's actually pretty
25:42 - subtle something has the class of grid
25:44 - excel we just don't care about it but in
25:46 - general we want it to have a small
25:49 - gutter so the way that we can do this is
25:51 - very subtle right we put a extra column
25:54 - right here and right here now no matter
25:58 - what there will always be a 1.5 RM which
26:02 - valuates - I think 24 pixels there
26:04 - always be a gutter to the left and the
26:06 - right of our content column and then the
26:08 - one if R is just the the remainder space
26:11 - so check this out it's really it's
26:14 - really amazing right so we load up the
26:16 - web page and now we've got that gutter
26:21 - so so that's good and then we go ahead
26:23 - and put grid excel and then it's gone so
26:27 - it's really that easy for us to define
26:29 - the
26:30 - laying out using CSS grid and still
26:32 - embed it into our boma so we get the
26:34 - benefits of both CSS grid and OMA next
26:37 - we're going to learn how to make this
26:38 - author thing at the top and then we'll
26:40 - make the title and I'll see you in the
26:42 - next screencast
26:47 - hey you will come back ooh now that
26:50 - we're code gods we're ready to ready to
26:52 - move on and we're gonna start with the
26:54 - title of these all right the author at
26:56 - the top then we're gonna do the the
26:58 - title under that so how do we how do we
27:00 - do this well if you recognize a pattern
27:02 - here that's good we're going to use the
27:04 - media class the media component again
27:07 - because it makes simple how do we do the
27:09 - icon or the image at the at the left and
27:12 - then a title and then a paragraph to the
27:14 - right so one difference though is that
27:17 - we're gonna have this icon or the image
27:19 - in the center right
27:21 - you can't hit here but if we had
27:22 - multiple lines we would still want that
27:24 - image to be centered so we'll learn how
27:26 - to do that too and we're ready to go
27:29 - ahead and grab the media component and
27:35 - one thing is that this will belong in
27:36 - its own section so we'll grab that too
27:44 - all right
27:45 - and then one thing that we'll want to do
27:49 - is it's pretty much safe to assume that
27:53 - we can use this again and we can use
27:58 - grid here again as well if we wanted to
28:01 - refactor this we could go into here and
28:03 - then make a rule for section to
28:05 - automatically get rid of the padding
28:08 - left in the padding right so that we
28:09 - didn't have to put it here every time
28:11 - but for now I'm just gonna put that like
28:12 - this so here we go right here we're
28:17 - gonna put an image so I'll grab the
28:19 - class for that component for that do
28:21 - this one all right there I change this
28:27 - to 64 by 64 and there isn't a class for
28:33 - every size it's just that this is
28:35 - there's a few predefined classes 64 is
28:37 - one of them so I'm not there's not like
28:39 - a 65 by 65 and so on and so forth all
28:42 - right and then here we'll swap out the
28:44 - image new images and we're gonna grab
28:47 - the which one was it me me me me me me
28:52 - me JPEG okay great now for the content
28:57 - the content what we'll do is put this in
29:00 - a paragraph
29:01 - and then let's see we got zenok okay so
29:08 - let's put that in real quick all right
29:11 - so we have a strong tag to make a bold
29:13 - we have a link that goes nowhere right
29:15 - now then I'm gonna force the text this
29:19 - text to be gray so to do that I've got
29:21 - it wrapped inside of a span and then
29:23 - I've given it the class it has text
29:25 - grade to just force to be a bit lighter
29:27 - then I'm just using a break to break to
29:30 - the next line because it belongs to the
29:32 - same paragraph and then here this is
29:35 - definitely recommended we're using the
29:37 - time element so that search engines can
29:39 - basically document when this when the
29:41 - intended publication date was so for
29:44 - this I've just put the same date as I
29:46 - have that I published this article so
29:48 - that was April April 20th all right and
29:52 - the rest is pretty simple by the way
29:54 - this is not the bullet character it's
29:57 - actually I think I'm saying a right
29:59 - interpunct right this is an octave
30:03 - thorpe so alright wait so let's see how
30:08 - this looks nice now you'll note if you
30:12 - are OCD like me that the image is not in
30:15 - the center right we've got that little
30:17 - gap and Neath but not above so how do we
30:19 - deal with that to feel a little while to
30:21 - figure this out
30:21 - but it's pretty simple we're gonna make
30:23 - a general use class that we can use and
30:26 - I'm gonna call it Center which this will
30:29 - use flexbox
30:30 - so we just got flex here and then I'm
30:32 - going to Center horizontally and
30:34 - vertically if you were asleep earlier we
30:37 - did this like a few screencasts ago so
30:38 - this really isn't anything new
30:41 - do where do we put that know where we
30:44 - can actually put it as right here the
30:47 - reason is is because we're going to
30:48 - Center
30:49 - not just the figure but the text too
30:50 - because the text is taller than the
30:53 - figure the text will not actually have a
30:55 - gap above or beneath it but because the
30:57 - figure is shorter than the text the
30:59 - figure will have a gap above and beneath
31:01 - it now huh all right we'll turn out the
31:04 - debugger and that's one problem solved
31:07 - but we have one more not this huge gap
31:10 - up here and you might like that
31:12 - I don't so the way that we deal with
31:14 - that again is the padding here because
31:17 - we've started a new section Balma
31:20 - basically said hey I think I want you to
31:22 - have some padding - where's gonna be
31:24 - lips it's gonna be a little dirty here
31:27 - and just can mine that out all right so
31:32 - now we've got that nice even gap above
31:34 - and below the nav and then the other
31:37 - part really looks ideal now on for the
31:42 - title I don't know that this is the most
31:45 - idiomatic way to do this it's just sort
31:47 - of what I worked out and put something
31:51 - inside of a div ID of it we'll do an h1
31:54 - and h2 remember I want to give this
32:00 - style and give them a class of title and
32:05 - subtitle
32:07 - remember there's modifiers to change the
32:10 - size so I'll have this Cascade I'll do
32:12 - is - and then is 3 and here do how to
32:18 - build yeah that's great let's take a
32:21 - look Oh
32:25 - so when I came up with was this well we
32:28 - know that sections will go ahead and
32:30 - give us some padding why don't we just
32:33 - use a section class here we don't need
32:35 - to use the section element because
32:37 - that's not semantically correct
32:39 - this isn't really a new section but we
32:41 - can borrow the properties from section
32:43 - to style this very consistently so I
32:47 - just grab this
32:53 - and voila alright let's see how it looks
32:57 - on a mobile device not bad
33:00 - we'll do some things later to make the
33:02 - text appear a little bit smaller so that
33:04 - it fits better but other than that it
33:06 - looks great alright in the next
33:08 - screencast we're going to figure out how
33:10 - to do our images which are gorgeous and
33:12 - then we're going to go and do the
33:13 - content in the screencast after all
33:16 - right I will see you very very soon
33:23 - hey welcome back we've got this
33:26 - beautiful blog design and now we're
33:28 - ready for these really nice images so
33:31 - what's that about well what we can do is
33:34 - go to the docs and we're gonna grab the
33:37 - columns like we used before yeah
33:40 - and then looking here I've got three so
33:43 - do three columns we're going to do three
33:49 - columns so do okay we have our three
33:54 - columns inside of each column there's
33:57 - going to be an image which could be a
33:59 - link it could be just an image that's
34:01 - fine and then we'll have a caption at
34:03 - the bottom alright so we'll grab the
34:05 - image class and then that goes inside of
34:08 - each of these I will remove this guy
34:12 - from now and then with you up three
34:15 - images right here it's gonna be blog one
34:17 - through three okay let's see what
34:21 - happens
34:22 - all right hang on right images yeah ooh
34:29 - yeah it's okay so we forgot to make this
34:34 - a grid excel right how's that look
34:38 - hey looks okay so one thing that we can
34:42 - do in boma is use the remember how we
34:45 - use notification before to give sort of
34:47 - a background well there's a few more
34:48 - that we can use there's box and card I
34:51 - really like card so we use it here and
34:53 - that'll give us that little nice line
34:55 - and a very very subtle shadow beneath it
34:58 - so that's the effect that we have here
35:00 - all right and then I'll just add a card
35:02 - to each of these yeah so you've got this
35:08 - gap which is a bit weird and then we had
35:11 - this other problem we're on a mobile
35:13 - device we probably would like this in
35:16 - general but for images we just want it
35:19 - to be wide the whole time okay let's go
35:22 - and get rid of the gap first so there's
35:25 - a feature called is variable which has
35:27 - its own modifier I think it's like one
35:29 - through a few maybe one two three four
35:31 - and if we use zero that will turn off
35:33 - the gap now if I want to increase that
35:36 - just
35:37 - little bit one or two or three let's do
35:39 - two yeah so this is a really nice
35:42 - feature if you don't want to completely
35:43 - remove it just partly remove it all
35:46 - right so we're gonna make this zero and
35:49 - yeah that looks really cool how do we
35:53 - deal with this there's another modifier
35:56 - that we can use for columns because
35:58 - columns are such an essential component
36:00 - God is mobile I want you to keep your
36:03 - aesthetic whether you're on a mobile or
36:04 - a desktop device really quite simple and
36:09 - again the reason that this isn't going
36:12 - full with here is because of the
36:13 - container if we really didn't like that
36:17 - it wouldn't be hard for us to just
36:18 - remove it all right and let's go ahead
36:21 - and add a figure caption below do you
36:25 - think caption a caption you know what
36:30 - I'm gonna make this a figure so that
36:31 - it's easier and then we can just make
36:34 - these good as for now instead now I want
36:37 - this to be small and Volman eise's that
36:39 - so no problem and then what was the text
36:42 - it was like that and you don't need to
36:46 - quit because you're already here good
36:48 - stewards of the Internet let's gonna
36:49 - make these links that go nowhere okay
36:52 - and then over here
36:54 - let's who happens so okay I think we
36:59 - know what we can do right we could put
37:00 - the class center here all of our
37:03 - problems go away yeah that's not bad and
37:06 - then let's just see how this would look
37:07 - with some content beneath it so just do
37:09 - you like yeah right we need a we need a
37:17 - we need some we need some space there so
37:19 - what we needs is because this doesn't
37:21 - belong to boma boma isn't giving us any
37:24 - any special treatment
37:25 - instead the Bommel way to do this might
37:28 - be to use level allows you to align
37:32 - content along level this is just
37:34 - indicating that anything in it needs to
37:37 - belong anywhere on the left the center
37:38 - or the right and then here I can make
37:42 - this a level item now basically saying I
37:45 - want this thing to be a level and then
37:47 - we have one item so this should be
37:48 - centered and because the
37:50 - belongs to MoMA he knows how to give us
37:52 - that breathing room that we so desire
37:54 - right before the concent was hugging it
37:56 - and that was an ideal yeah so we now we
38:01 - had that little space right there and
38:05 - then let's make the text a little bit
38:07 - lighter du has text gray and then the
38:14 - last thing is there's for me I'm really
38:17 - picky though I don't want this gap right
38:18 - here well if we inspect it eventually
38:21 - we'll find that that is a margin being
38:23 - applied so it's a market being applied
38:25 - to the columns what we can do is just
38:27 - say remember we use is penniless before
38:30 - well here I use is marginalists oh yeah
38:35 - that looks so cool and of course it's
38:39 - all responsive yeah all right I'll see
38:42 - you in the next screencast where we add
38:44 - this content and then we'll add a rule
38:46 - to make this a little bit smaller on a
38:48 - mobile device so that the content fits a
38:50 - bit better alright see you soon
38:58 - welcome back Internet now we're ready to
39:00 - add the content of our blog it'd be a
39:02 - pretty terrible blog we just kept it as
39:05 - is and it's beautiful but it's kind of
39:07 - useless so what we can do is in the
39:10 - documentation there is a class that we
39:13 - can use called content and you my friend
39:16 - have seen this before
39:18 - voila right you've seen this now content
39:22 - didn't do anything for us at the time
39:24 - because we just had a boring old
39:25 - paragraph but now we're gonna start to
39:27 - understand really how powerful content
39:29 - is and content becomes especially
39:32 - relevant if you want to use markdown in
39:35 - your websites because doing on these
39:37 - attributes all the time can be a bit
39:39 - annoying sometimes you just want the
39:41 - element to describe the content and for
39:43 - that to be enough and so content is a
39:45 - great example of this so let's do an h1
39:49 - view and h2 right
39:52 - so note these don't have the title or
39:55 - the subtitle that we've used before
39:56 - which was necessary when we wanted to
39:59 - give this the style here these are just
40:01 - naked HTML elements when we load them up
40:04 - note that they do have a style and
40:06 - that's because content is helping us out
40:08 - here content is really magical because
40:11 - we basically don't have to worry about
40:14 - any of the trivial elements that we
40:16 - might want to use it's good for
40:17 - paragraphs for for lists whether they're
40:20 - ordered or unordered you've got your h's
40:22 - that i've showed you before we've got
40:23 - block quotes and even tables it's pretty
40:26 - awesome I'm gonna grab a really complete
40:29 - example from the website super complete
40:32 - and I'll show you what I mean
40:34 - wait there are no funny classes right I
40:38 - mean even have stuff like this where
40:41 - there's it's it's super right and then
40:43 - here we've got the sub four I mean it
40:45 - stands for so maybe submarine I don't
40:47 - know what that stands for okay well
40:49 - let's take a look whoa what so look at
40:53 - that right our blog is really gorgeous
40:57 - and we have to do so little work to get
41:00 - there now this let me just point that
41:02 - out that is my tabs screwing with the
41:04 - source code so here this is wrapped in a
41:08 - pre which means basically pre process
41:11 - don't cross us this text you want to
41:13 - have that hug the left wall where
41:14 - there's no no space to the left then
41:18 - that extra space we can fix that like
41:22 - that at least that's one way to fix it
41:25 - I'm sure there are others anyway this is
41:27 - really powerful the rate boma has done
41:30 - so much heavy lifting for us and all we
41:33 - had to use is HTML
41:34 - I think Tim berners-lee would be like
41:36 - extremely proud right now so anyway for
41:39 - for our website I'm gonna go ahead and
41:41 - just get rid of this instead I'll put
41:45 - the content yeah now check this out this
41:51 - is also why content is so powerful the
41:54 - content can scale so we can have medium
41:57 - content we can download content contents
42:02 - pretty miraculous I mean you can have
42:04 - different paragraphs in your website
42:06 - have different sizes and that's not just
42:08 - true for text it's true for all those
42:11 - elements that I showed you just a moment
42:13 - ago so boma is really freaking magical
42:15 - let's say you wanted to do like is large
42:18 - notification that's a really simple
42:23 - example of how we combine different bola
42:25 - moment classes to make like an
42:28 - advertisement or like a banner and then
42:31 - let's say we want to like style it right
42:34 - it's really crazy how powerful boma is
42:37 - anyway
42:38 - let's go ahead and just leave that - I
42:41 - think this medium was good and that's it
42:44 - this is how you make a beautiful blog
42:46 - you know in a responsive sense it's not
42:49 - optimized I mean it is mobile but the
42:51 - text is a bit big so I'll show you a
42:54 - fascinatingly simple way that we can we
42:56 - can fix that make a media query which
43:00 - means I want you to override some code
43:02 - in this circumstance and the
43:04 - circumstance if we're rendering our
43:06 - website at some max width then consider
43:09 - the following rules so I'll say I want
43:11 - my route element to update its font size
43:13 - from the default of 16 pixels to say
43:17 - like - like 414 let's just do a percent
43:22 - be like 90 percent 100 percent would be
43:24 - 16 pixel
43:25 - here 90% with not 14 but definitely
43:29 - easier on the eyes and then the
43:31 - circumstance is when I get to right here
43:35 - so we know that this is 624 and I need
43:41 - some way to say 624 plus these guys so I
43:46 - can say plus 1.5 REM so remember one REM
43:51 - is 16 pixels so 1.5 REM is 24 pixels and
43:57 - then we knew times 248 and then we do 6
44:01 - 24 plus 48 and then we can say 6 72
44:05 - pixels all right now when we get to that
44:10 - when we cross over from a desktop or a
44:13 - tablet device to what we're calling a
44:15 - mobile device we get a slight update and
44:19 - everything that is defined with an e/m
44:21 - or in rem as its unit will also
44:23 - proportionally change to its really
44:26 - powerful if we wanted to go even further
44:30 - totally possible to that's it you've
44:34 - made a beautiful blog in like record
44:36 - time and it's ence responsive and we
44:39 - have like what the team lines of code
44:42 - it's crazy
44:43 - yeah so that's amazing now we're gonna
44:47 - go all the way up to a launch page I
44:50 - have stolen the Tesla Roadster page and
44:52 - then made it our own using boma believe
44:54 - it or not this will also be responsive
44:56 - and we're gonna do it with again very
44:59 - little code all right enough talk let's
45:01 - get into it
45:02 - I'll see you in the next screencast
45:09 - hey welcome back I'm pretty excited I'm
45:12 - not gonna say much about this we're just
45:14 - gonna get started alright so we're gonna
45:16 - use a hero I'm gonna drop the hero body
45:20 - I'm just gonna start with that alright
45:25 - let's take a look with the debugger
45:26 - turned on and ah it's not occupying any
45:30 - height so for that we can do is full
45:34 - height remember we do that pretty
45:36 - recently when we were designing this
45:38 - webpage here we have its full height and
45:40 - then here we just removed it so for this
45:43 - website you can imagine that we just
45:45 - have a hero and it has a modifier of is
45:47 - full height okay let's take a look now
45:50 - it's a darker color right if I remove
45:52 - that it's a little lighter and that's
45:56 - because it's a darker color on top of
45:58 - our whole website that being the hero
46:00 - okay
46:01 - so we can start to fill in the
46:02 - background so in our images we've got
46:05 - one two and three and we're going to use
46:07 - multiple images because we want our
46:10 - website to look different on a mobile or
46:12 - a tablet device so this is actually a
46:16 - different image than this one I mean
46:17 - it's the same picture but they've the
46:20 - the tesla team has edited it so that
46:22 - it's optimized for a mobile or a tablet
46:24 - device I'm going to do the same here so
46:28 - all we need to do is target the hero I
46:30 - want to say you have a background and
46:33 - Lee a background of images and then 0 1
46:37 - right see what happens
46:40 - oh hang on the debugger is overriding
46:45 - the background yeah the first time this
46:48 - happened I thought my screen was dirty
46:50 - yeah it's the pictures huge right so we
46:54 - need to let's Center it all right so we
47:00 - need to go a bit further when you use
47:02 - something called cover which means I
47:04 - want this image to basically want the
47:06 - image to fit inside of our websites
47:08 - browser yeah that looks really good and
47:13 - it is responsive in a sense but the
47:16 - problem is is that on mobile devices
47:18 - it's just too narrow we we can't see the
47:20 - car it just doesn't look ideal
47:22 - so to fix that what we can do is use a
47:25 - media query actual Renee is two that are
47:28 - max that are max with is a thousand 24
47:31 - pixels or we're 768 pixels then wanted
47:38 - to display a different background and we
47:41 - just update that let's take a look hey
47:45 - we move a yeah
47:46 - missing the hero okay yeah so that
47:53 - actually does look better
47:54 - right alright so there is the desktop
47:58 - right and we get to a tablet changes a
48:01 - little bit and then on a mobile device
48:03 - that changes even more so the point is
48:05 - that these images are optimized for
48:07 - different devices and that's great we'll
48:11 - get a better experience as a result now
48:14 - you might have noticed when I was
48:16 - changing the the widths you might have
48:18 - seen it like a flash of white well
48:20 - that's because the background behind the
48:22 - image will default to white if we're not
48:25 - explicit we want that to be black which
48:27 - i think is a bit more a bit more brand
48:31 - we can just do this and while we're
48:35 - waiting for an image to load as we're
48:37 - changing the width we'll get a stroke of
48:39 - black yeah so now we get like a stroke
48:42 - of black if our image is still loading
48:44 - which i think is just a little bit
48:46 - better than white so that's it for this
48:49 - screencast and the next one will focus
48:50 - on the the navigation bar at the top
48:53 - which of course will be mobile but in a
48:57 - different sense we're gonna hide some
48:58 - content in the event that we're on a
49:00 - mobile device all right I'll see you
49:01 - very soon
49:07 - hey welcome back now we're going to add
49:09 - that nap bar at the top and it's going
49:11 - to require some extra CSS so I have
49:14 - these helpers here and we're going to
49:16 - link to them like this so it's not that
49:20 - different than the way that we've linked
49:21 - our debugger it's actually the same but
49:24 - looking at our helpers we have a few
49:26 - things that we need to add in order to
49:28 - make this work
49:29 - you're familiar with Center that's
49:30 - nothing new but now instead of just
49:32 - centering an element inside of another
49:35 - one when you put it at the top the right
49:37 - the bottom and the left so that's nice
49:39 - and we have this special case where by
49:42 - default Flex Direction sets to row and
49:47 - in the event that we want it to set to
49:49 - column then we can just use center
49:51 - column instead might be wondering what
49:54 - the heck does that mean well looking at
49:56 - this the elements are following each
49:59 - other across a row whereas here they're
50:02 - following each other across a column so
50:04 - this is an example where if we want the
50:06 - elements to fall vertically we can say
50:09 - Center column and that will still Center
50:12 - Center the element inside of a column
50:14 - all right these just make this stuff
50:16 - work and then down here this is how we
50:19 - can have a single single space text and
50:22 - here this is if we want to hide
50:24 - something if we're on a mobile device so
50:28 - at a thousand 24 pixels anything that
50:31 - has a class of desktop I want it to just
50:33 - disappear all right so now we can add
50:35 - that nav bar and to do that we're gonna
50:37 - go into our Docs if I want to grab this
50:39 - guy instead of body we're going to use
50:43 - head here okay now the way that I
50:47 - thought of this design is to have this
50:50 - split into three columns so I have the
50:52 - left the center and then the right
50:53 - column over here we know how to do that
50:56 - just go to grab the columns and then we
50:58 - put that there and we know we'll have
51:01 - three so I'll just put this like this
51:04 - now remember when we're on a mobile
51:07 - device it's gonna stack the columns so
51:09 - to fix that we can just put is mobile
51:11 - and I found that if we put is margin
51:14 - list it'll look a lot prettier right
51:16 - it's just very simple now so now I'm
51:20 - going to fill in the valley
51:21 - with some texts for now this hey cool so
51:28 - our elements are falling vertically and
51:31 - we don't want that we effectively want
51:33 - them to fall horizontally if you
51:35 - remember a moment ago one of our helpers
51:37 - well these helpers do that because flex
51:41 - direction is set to row by default
51:43 - that's exactly what we want in fact we
51:46 - can just leave that there and it won't
51:47 - do anything at all I'll just put the
51:51 - center here and that actually centers
51:56 - the elements inside of their parent easy
51:59 - enough we can just make that left and
52:00 - right cool
52:03 - it's looking better now to deal with the
52:05 - fact that the text is just too close I
52:07 - found that there is a class just for
52:11 - this purpose so use nav bar found that
52:15 - there's a class to do with this so
52:18 - commute now our item mount will space it
52:21 - out real nicely so we just put that
52:23 - everywhere
52:25 - hey great this is looking phenomenal now
52:29 - on a mobile device we still have the
52:31 - trouble of having all this data so the
52:33 - way that we can deal with it is we'll
52:35 - just put desktop here remember remember
52:38 - that's this one here saying at thousand
52:41 - 24 pixels or less hide the content
52:43 - instead of putting it here for it for
52:45 - shop and sign-in
52:49 - we want to keep this button here so
52:51 - instead you can put desktop there and
52:59 - that was really easy okay
53:03 - now really all that's left is just style
53:05 - so all that's really left is basically
53:08 - the icon and then the style so the style
53:11 - is actually pretty easy everything is a
53:14 - heading and it has a text weight of fold
53:18 - we also want the text to be black and I
53:21 - found I can't just put has text black
53:24 - here it doesn't work so instead we're
53:27 - gonna be a bit lazy and just put it
53:30 - right here so again if we wanted to we
53:33 - could just refactor this in the style or
53:35 - even go all the way to Beaumont and
53:37 - customize it for our needs but for now
53:39 - just do it this way alright that's
53:44 - looking really good let's swap out the
53:46 - text here and the text here with the
53:49 - right image and icon so we know so for
53:55 - so we're familiar enough so we're
53:58 - familiar enough with how to do that
53:59 - so we know how to do that we just grab
54:01 - that and we go to here and I want to
54:07 - keep our item and I don't need will link
54:13 - our logo
54:16 - which is right here and you'll note that
54:21 - it's gonna be like crazy it's because
54:23 - it's rendering the SVG's height and
54:26 - width and not the desired height and
54:28 - width I'm just gonna inline this for now
54:32 - and we can say height one REM which kind
54:36 - of works but the width is still way too
54:38 - big you can see that here but a fix that
54:43 - I worked out that the width to the
54:45 - height was six point two five that's
54:48 - great and now we just need to deal with
54:51 - the hamburger so we just copied that put
54:54 - it here and then there is a font awesome
54:57 - icon for this now you'll note that the
55:03 - text is grayish so should we say it has
55:08 - text black and let's just make sure it's
55:12 - all good
55:13 - you might be wondering why is the height
55:16 - changing so again what we'll do is we
55:19 - can give it a fixed width and height
55:23 - make it one two one and let's take a
55:26 - look so we got the the boundaries right
55:30 - but here it's just doing something funny
55:33 - found that if we put the center here all
55:36 - of our problems go away let's take a
55:40 - look all right now to emulate that this
55:43 - is active go to a rope stir and make
55:47 - that way I believe that there's an is
55:50 - active class that you can use or you can
55:52 - make your own style or you can do this
55:54 - your own way I just want to show you the
55:56 - fastest way that you could so I want to
55:58 - show you I just want to show you the
55:59 - fastest way that you could emulate that
56:01 - design now unfortunately I don't have
56:03 - enough time to make this interactive but
56:07 - we will finish this responsive and all
56:09 - alright I'll see you in the next
56:11 - screencast
56:16 - hey welcome back so our sites awesome
56:19 - and now we're going to add in the Tesla
56:22 - and roadster text that you see at the
56:23 - top to do that I'm gonna add a hero body
56:28 - and then we're gonna have an each one
56:31 - and in h2 whoops and you can probably
56:38 - work out how we style this right we just
56:41 - do and actually let's do subtitle here
56:44 - because the text is smaller not bigger
56:46 - and then we'll put title here yeah so
56:56 - just put this in a good for now I don't
56:58 - know what you're doing just put it in a
57:00 - div okay so this works all the same
57:03 - alright so the point is we want to have
57:05 - this up at the top and we want it to be
57:07 - centered so what we need to do is
57:10 - basically override override
57:12 - where is fault where it falls on the
57:14 - page and there's a general class that we
57:16 - can use to to deal with this so we can
57:19 - view is overlay which means it's
57:23 - position is independent from the content
57:25 - on the page so even though I've got
57:31 - content here the fact that it's overlaid
57:33 - on top just ignores that so it's a good
57:35 - start and there is a modifier has text
57:39 - centered to center the text and then you
57:42 - can kind of work out that we just need
57:44 - to just shift it down a bit so we can
57:46 - use style top and 82 was right now note
57:52 - I'm not using p.m. or REM here because I
57:54 - want the height to always be the same
57:56 - whether we're on a mobile device or not
57:58 - let's take a look so yeah that looks
58:02 - great so we turn off the debugger and I
58:04 - guess all that's left is this gap in
58:06 - between and the the text color itself I
58:09 - think you know how to do this right we
58:11 - could just say hey wait a minute
58:13 - I know how to do that just do has text
58:14 - in black there how that worked and would
58:21 - use single spaced here similar space
58:26 - what do you single spaced here
58:31 - remember our helper we had single space
58:34 - to find because I have this other
58:36 - version of it it doesn't matter where we
58:38 - define it we can put it here or we can
58:41 - put it up here
58:42 - so the asterisk is really vital here
58:47 - okay so now that content pretty much
58:50 - hugs each other which is what we want
58:52 - and then finally I want this to be a
58:55 - little bit lighter so instead of
58:58 - changing the color let's change the the
59:00 - text wave it has text weight light and
59:04 - yeah that gives us sort of a nice
59:06 - aesthetic all right that one was easy
59:09 - now last we're gonna do this like
59:10 - complicated thing at the bottom and I
59:13 - was like super intimidated when I went
59:15 - to Tesla and was like how do I do that
59:17 - turns out that this is actually pretty
59:20 - intuitive if we use grid I'm sure
59:22 - there's a way that you could use flexbox
59:23 - but I found that grid was basically the
59:26 - most expressive way to solve this
59:28 - problem that's it for this screencast
59:30 - see you in the final screencast
59:38 - hey welcome back so our site it's
59:40 - freaking awesome but it's missing the
59:42 - specs at the bottom they're kind of
59:45 - intricate they're a responsive design is
59:48 - not like anything we've seen so far so
59:50 - you might be feeling a bit intimidated
59:52 - now how do you possibly do this and do
59:55 - that in like 10 minutes or less and the
59:58 - thing is if you have the right tool it
60:00 - can be a lot easier than you imagined so
60:02 - what we're gonna do is use CSS grid here
60:04 - so I have a link to a file called grid
60:07 - and over here I have it defined it's
60:10 - just empty when you use grid to create
60:13 - this design and it's going to be a lot
60:15 - easier than I think you might imagine
60:16 - let's go ahead and create our hero's
60:19 - foot do like this and like a main
60:24 - instead would be footer but it's up to
60:28 - you
60:29 - and we're going to follow the format
60:32 - that we did before so we have everything
60:34 - inside of a div just inside of the
60:37 - parent so here is where we can define
60:42 - our grid and I'm going to use an ID for
60:45 - this it could be a class but doesn't
60:47 - really matter at least not right now
60:49 - now looking at this design I want you to
60:51 - imagine that this is four columns and
60:54 - two rows I want you to imagine that this
60:57 - is four columns and two rows so you have
61:00 - one two three four for the columns and
61:03 - then here you have two rows right so you
61:06 - have one and two and beyond that you
61:08 - have five elements you have one two
61:12 - three four and five
61:14 - all right so we'll create five gifts I
61:17 - love
61:19 - so a b c d e so if we go to our grid
61:27 - okay so now let's turn on the let's turn
61:29 - on the debugger okay so you can see the
61:34 - foot is trying to exist here but there's
61:37 - just nothing to show all right so we'll
61:39 - put some content yeah all right so let's
61:43 - constrain the grid to say with 768 and
61:49 - then let's Center here because that will
61:51 - Center its child which is the grid cool
61:55 - and let's just add a padding around here
62:01 - okay cool so now it's got like this
62:03 - little gap beneath it which is like we
62:06 - have here you a grid like this and then
62:09 - display grid set of grid template
62:13 - columns for interview areas so areas are
62:20 - pretty amazing
62:21 - if you remember we have four columns and
62:23 - two rows so in terms of IDs this is a B
62:27 - C D and E and so what we want is to say
62:30 - it that a occupies all four columns in
62:33 - the first row and then BCDE each occupy
62:36 - one column but span the entire row I
62:38 - think I said that right all right so
62:40 - here's how we can do that and say eh eh
62:43 - eh eh so this is one row and then four
62:47 - columns here we can say we c d e alright
62:53 - let's see what happens we've got the
62:55 - text at the top and then these would
62:57 - each be these specs now on a mobile
63:00 - device this won't do anything fancy but
63:02 - I bet you have an idea of how we can do
63:04 - that we can say at media max with 512
63:08 - pixels and say grid when an override
63:13 - grid template areas it's astonishing how
63:17 - simple this is
63:18 - all we need to do is remove a column and
63:22 - add a row that's it I know I know it's
63:30 - crazy
63:33 - it's who happens so
63:38 - on a mobile device you can see how the
63:41 - reserve now is at the bottom and the
63:43 - specs are in the center and then the
63:45 - text is at the top and then that changes
63:47 - depending on what we're looking at the
63:50 - rest of this is really just aesthetics
63:52 - so what we can do is we can say hey I
63:54 - want the rose to have a gap you say grid
63:58 - row gap one REM that gives us a nice
64:04 - break in between and I think you know
64:08 - what to do now the rest is really just
64:10 - titles subtitles and an icon so I'm
64:13 - gonna go in and paste them in because it
64:15 - is pretty cumbersome but I bet you'll
64:17 - understand all of it once I put it here
64:22 - so there it is and let's just talk about
64:25 - it real quick
64:26 - so one of the things that you'll note is
64:28 - that we're using contact column because
64:30 - I want the text here to be on top of
64:32 - each other if we used Center which is
64:35 - flex direction row it flows left to
64:37 - right and so to fix that we just say
64:40 - center column take a look you'll you'll
64:43 - recognize all of this code now we have a
64:46 - paragraph has text centered has text
64:48 - white here we have a paragraph with an
64:51 - icon inside of it here I've got this
64:54 - speed icon has text gray light we set a
64:59 - fixed width in a fixed height which is
65:01 - just a little bit smaller than the text
65:03 - and we can use modifiers so we have
65:07 - bearing size text right we have 1.9 as
65:10 - big and then small we have s and that's
65:13 - because of the and that's because we're
65:14 - changing the size with the modifier is
65:17 - size 5 for the reserve Now button that's
65:22 - really just a link it has some modifiers
65:24 - and I set the width to a hundred so that
65:28 - always occupies the available width and
65:30 - really that's all there is to it the
65:32 - thing is with boma you can really
65:34 - rapidly prototype and the code is fairly
65:36 - idiomatic so I really hope you enjoyed
65:39 - this course please
65:40 - please share this if you think it was
65:42 - valuable and if you want to reach out to
65:44 - me and if you want to reach out to me
65:47 - hit me up on Twitter right here you can
65:50 - click my face
65:51 - otherwise yeah congratulations you are
65:53 - now a Bowman ninja happy coding
65:56 - see ya

Cleaned transcript:

hey welcome to my Bommel course before we get started I first want to make sure that you're familiar with scrim ba scrim bow is this interactive platform that you're using you can record and edit other people's screencasts and see the changes in real times if I have a website here you can actually copy edit the code say let's say hello Roma save it and then that will be reflected in the browser so everything that I do here you can do it as well or copied and save it as your own all right this is my beaumont course and in it you're gonna learn how to use MoMA MoMA is a modern CSS framework from Jeremy Thomas who goes by Jake Adams it's based on flexbox and using MoMA we can describe our websites design using just classes flexbox is a newer CSS spec that makes sectioning and aligning more natural we don't need to know flexbox but it is how boma works behind the scenes and when I say classes what I mean is that instead of writing around a CSS per element you can use it predefined classes this is really what the bulk of boma is and with enough classes we can describe our websites design using just semantics so before we deconstruct what that means take a look at the icons that you see below with OMA we can prototype columns form elements components modifiers layout elements and elements themselves the way that we interact with a boma is first we use this template this is the standard template that you would use when you start to author any MoMA website I've added one line of code and this is so that we can understand our website it's just a CSS debugger if you want to enable it you can just uncomment this line and see that it looks a bit different we'll use that to make sure that our website is designed perfectly other than that this is where bulma is getting linked to our website and then this these are font awesome icons this will load it up into your website okay we were talking about classes before this area right over here well boma is styling classes for us and with enough classes we can make a really robust and response website this for example would create the website that I've been showing you so far which already out of the box is responsive doesn't mean a lot so far but it will going forward okay this is a boma website and it's one of the three websites that we're going to learn to make in these screencasts this is what it would look like on a mobile device and on the right a tablet device whereas this was the desktop and then we're going to learn how to make a beautiful blog I already created a course for this but this one will be using boma and will take a fraction of the time instead of 40 minutes you'll be able to do this in maybe 15 or so minutes then after that we're gonna make a launch page for a product here I've recreated the Tesla Roadster page this is not the actual page it's just my version of it it is responsive and that's how it would look on a mobile and a tablet device alright so this is pretty exciting stuff if you have any questions or comments you want to reach out to me you can click my face reach out to me on Twitter otherwise I think we're ready to get started alright I'll see you in the next screencast where we'll first build this website and then that will slowly turn into this one all right I'll see you there hey welcome back so in this screencast we're going to turn this website into this one this actually is a website and then we'll use this as a base to add some complexity and make it a bit prettier until we get all the way back up to our original slide which again is responsive so on a mobile device this and then as a tablet on the right alright so how do we begin just to start let me point out that we have a few folders and files ready to go I have our images that we use across all of our websites and then I have some of almost documentation this is by no means all of boma this is maybe 10 or 15% if I had to guess might be much less than that but the point is that way Poma works is that we have our classes and these classes usually follow some HTML contract and that means that our boma is pretty idiomatic and that another boma developer could look at our website and just by looking at these contracts understand our website so looking at our website this is the first thing that we see and in our code we have a section a better component that we could use instead of a section is a hero so section is more generic whereas hero signifies it's important it's the first thing that we see so now we don't have very much let's go ahead and look at the debugger and we can see that the element is occupying just a portion but by no means all the height so what we can do is hero has a modifier called is full height modifiers allowed to just modify some other class and in this case is full height is limited to hero you can't use it everywhere we're also going to add another modifier as background black turning off our debugger okay so often when you want to put something inside of a hero or a section you put a container we can see that the container is trying to create a space for us to put some content okay and then in our container I'm going to add a image so we're gonna add the image contract and put that right in here you might be wondering why do we need to specify the dimension what can happen is that the website will resize itself because the images are loading and images can occupy a different height when they're unloaded as opposed to when they are loaded and so to avoid this behavior you can just specify what the dimensions are so there are predefined dimensions but you can also use an aspect ratio if you need more generalized dimensions now in this case we don't actually need this because our website is so simple right and then we'll swap out image source with our actual logo so say voila or the light which was in here right there and then that's in our images folder so we're almost there we definitely need to constrain the width so I'll just add X width and we'll say maybe 512 pixels all right and then last we want to Center it so here I'm going to add a style tag this is how we can interpolate our own CSS with homeless or create a center class which is just a generic centering class and then justify content is for the horizontal centering so we do use Center as the value and then align items is for the vertical centering the center class will Center whatever element is inside of it so we'll go up one element and we'll put it in here and it's centered we'll turn off the debugger and now we have a responsive website albeit pretty boring that's it for this one in the next one we are going to add some columns and make it a bit more like an actual website all right I'll see you in the next screencast hey welcome back so this is the state of our website it's terrible and what we can do to make it a bit better we're going to add a section so this is the hero at the tops the first thing that you see underneath we have a section and so we pretty much know how to do that we'll add the columns class and then three columns now we'll add some text and then we're on our way first things first let's go to our Docs and then get these section that right here so let's get rid of our is full height see how that looks and then let's make these size a bit smaller so I'll reduce it by a factor of two it cool looks good and then now we're gonna add some columns they'll go back to the moment dock and then here's columns okay so we'll just put that there turn on the debugger and then let's take a look so we have a column a single column occupying pretty much the full containers with what if we had two columns it's pretty smart here and it can figure this out for us we don't actually need to state how many columns we desire we can pretty much just put it right in here so we know that we're going to have three so I'll just add one more and then we can add in some text and then we'll turn off the debugger it's not quite the same so what's going on you can see that there is an area around the text but the text here is occupying pretty much the full column there's no padding there's no margin let's take a closer look alright there's no gap so what's going on well what we can do is can add a container inside of here but instead of container when you use what's called a notification in a notification will give it this sort of gray style that you see here so we're going to wrap the text in a notification class and see that it's got some area around it now yeah all right looks good all right looks great now what's so cool about flexbox and boma and all this stuff is that it can do a lot of the heavy lifting for us so here's what I mean if I resize or it's already responsive we didn't actually need to do very much to do that and you're here responsive design you have to have media queries and then you have to understand how everything connects to each other but boma understands these ideas and pretty much takes out the labor for us so that's awesome it's optimized for tablets desktops and mobile devices out of the box now I want to point out that notification can be modified just like we used has background black before you can use other modifiers so for example I can do is primary and take a look how the text is white and the background is green whereas over here the text is black and the background is gray all right now the last thing is if we want to control the text we can add a modifier so we'll need to wrap this in its own paragraph is size so we can do you like is three and you can see it got really really big so much that it's overwhelming believe there's one through seven and what we use for now is five so just a bit bigger and that's it in the next screencast when I add those is primary and some others to make this really beautiful and then add a title for each of these columns all right I'll see you in the next screencast hey welcome back so this is the state of a website not bad but we're gonna improve it with some color so it'll look like this by the time that we're finished which I think looks a lot better so how do we do that how do we go from here there all right so we know we need to remove the background make this the color logo because that is a different one than it is here and then we can give the columns their own background and then add a title and then add a color to our notification all right so that is pretty straightforward okay so like we mentioned we'll get rid of the has background black it'll default to a white but now our logo is invisible so we can go to our images and then we're gonna swap out the white one for this one alright just like that nice that's a bit big so let's change that max width so now we don't have a partition between our hero and the section to make that more obvious let me point that out with the debugger so here we can see that there's a beginning and an end to the hero and the section to make that more obvious we need to add a color that's why this one looks a bit different so we'll go to section I'm gonna add has background and I'm gonna use light for this nice so now we have a problem we can't see our column from the section right we need to be able to separate these two so what we can do is add a modifier to our notification right here we can do is and then of the available ones we have I think there's info is linked and you have danger warning and primary right so these would all happen is before them so let's see what they look like just turning off the deep bugger so yeah link gives us a nice blue feel free to experiment with these I'm going to use is info is primary and then is warning now let's really cool about using these thematic modifiers is they actually modify more than just the background take a look at the text the text has now altered firm black to white depending on which theme we're using so this is a really nice feature of OMA well we'll inverse the text in this case to make sure that it's readable if we force this to be a has text white right here it's not as readable as before so this is one of the things that boma is doing for us behind the scenes that I think is really cool now we only need to add a title so what we can do is we're going to add an H element so do h1 and then we'll do what was it oh yeah almost the first one and that does not look good that looks so inferior all right so let's attribute this so right now it's not getting anything from MoMA because it doesn't have a class so I'm going to give it a say title now we get something that stands out that's a bit big so I add a modifier to per title and we'll do is size to do I think one less yeah that looks good that's pretty quick right so Roma is doing a lot of the work for us now we're ready to move on to adding the columns that you see beneath all right I'll see you in the next screencast hey welcome back so our website looks like this which is alright I mean it's a bit boring but what we can do is beautify it so we're gonna give it some pecans and then another section and then that section will have its own cut icons that have a color and then the title and the paragraph will hug each other here so how do we do this we're gonna go to the boma documentation and we're gonna grab two classes we need the media class which is like a Facebook post or a Twitter post and then we need to grab the actual icon class which is here all right and I'm going to put that right in here we have our media left which is this area over here and then inside of it we need to put the icon class which is what we did here okay and then our content well we already have content it's here so we're just going to insert that right here and that's really it so let's go ahead and refactor this combine our notification with the media class so we'll do media notification and then all we need to do is we'll make this article this article and then we'll get rid of this guy alright so let's see how this looks got the wrong icon but it's a start the icon that will actually use is this one and I didn't memorize that that is coming from an awesome com so that's where we get the codes for the font awesome icons and we don't want this to have a color so we can just get rid of that for now our icon is appearing as white because of his info and that's pretty interesting if I put is warning the icon goes black that's a really nice feature to make the icon bigger we can add a modifier here let's say FA LG for large and you also have 2x and then every X and there's probably more so with you 2x for now I think that's the right size yeah that looks really good now if you want it to have more of an area around the icon I'll show you what I mean yeah that box is like really narrow it doesn't have that sort of nice area around it an easy way to fix that is we can add a modifier to the icon class of is medium or as large or try it as large yeah so that red definitely makes a difference and then let's turn off the bugger so it's a bit big let's just make that is medium instead cool yeah so that's really all there is to making this a media class who's gonna paste in the results pepper use act code that we wrote before just copied and pasted and yeah the rest of it is really the same thing so let's go ahead and just take all of this copy and paste it again all right and we know that we're gonna have six instead of three so we're gonna repeat the column so instead we have six columns and that does not look good so we need to fix this how do we how do we fix that so we can add a few things for every column we need to say it's one third there's a whole bunch of modifiers in use here we're gonna use is one third and then this will basically force each column to occupy one third of the website's width so we just repeat that process and then let's see how that looks all right that's a bit better but it's definitely on at the same line which is not ideal hope you had another modifier called is multiline and then this will force it to break Thanks now you probably know what to do here right what do we what's left we can get rid of the background for the whole section the notification doesn't need to have a color now it's great okay so let's just go ahead and force that so we say it has that ground white in our paragraph to make these hug to make this hug the title you can just give the class of subtitle now finally we're just gonna make this a little smaller and then get rid of this space around the icon we can give it a color by doing has text let's say warning I'm gonna go and paste in the results and then we'll load that up and what up it's really that cool and it's all responsive which is really amazing because we didn't we didn't even need to code that right one was doing all of this for us so bomb was really incredible at rapidly prototyping and shipping websites quickly and then coming up we're going to learn how to on the blog I'll see you in the next screencast hey welcome back so you just finished your first Bulma website and that's really amazing just how much fun looking new for you you think about it you did responsive beautiful website design without even touching was it any CSS like it was it's like for hot it's like five lines of CSS so bomb was really a powerhouse here and understanding and mastering boma can really I mean the thing is even if you don't use boa in production it can teach you how Jeremy or Jake Adams might solve a problem using boma and I think that's pretty amazing all right let's start up our new website this is going to be a blog and to start you'll note that we have this little breadcrumb at the top so let's go ahead and paste that in one of the components that we can use is the bread crumb so it's right here note that we're starting with the section in the container if we're not starting with the hero it makes sense that we would start with a section instead alright so put that right here and then let's take a look and it doesn't do anything because it's empty so I'm just filling with values all right so that looks really great now let's go ahead and open it up and it's okay but in our design here the contents pretty narrow so how do we how do we change that so I couldn't find a hundred percent idiomatic way to do this with bulma's so instead I relied on CSS grid so now we're going to learn how to embed CSS grid into boma and so here's what we can do create a grid class which requires it need display grid then when a template three columns because you can imagine that this website is really just three columns the container is the reason that this doesn't go all the way to the edge of the web page that's why we have a gap here but if we just ignore that gap we basically have a small column a bigger column and then a another small column over here well what we can do grid template columns and we're going to divide our website into thirds to start so we've new one if our one if our one fr fr stands for a fraction unit so now our websites being divided into thirds anywhere we put the grid class this one okay now we need to be pretty explicit here because if we just use grid as it is the content will fall into this column so because almost always the content falls into this column we just need to be explicit about that you belong to the second before the third column I want the content to start here and then end here so the syntax is two over three and then we can just put the grid here because of our content is inside of this div we put the grid here and the asterisk is referring to anything inside of the grid that would include this nav that will inherit this grid com rule okay so we go ahead and load this up our websites divided into thirds now with the content occupying just the center column it's a bit too narrow so what we can do instead is we'll give this a fixed width all right that's great and let's turn on the debugger so if we make this responsive oh and I forgot it off right there okay all right so looking with the debugger see this little these white lines right here well that's because our column is too wide on a mobile device it can't be 624 pixels that might be wider than the screen and say this is a responsive column with a minimum and a maximum width anywhere from 0 to 624 pixels so now you'll note that we don't get that side effect so that's great all right how we how do we get these bigger images if you look on a mobile device you'll note that they occupy the full width whereas on a desktop device it's just occupying most of the width so remember the reason we have this gap here is because of the container given that what's called this column medium and I can update this it's really amazing that grid is that subtle and then now if I wanted to refer to all three columns which is pretty much what this design is these images are spanning all three columns then I'll just create another identifier and then here I'll use Excel okay and then to use our new excel identifiers I need to create a class so that we can give a specific element say for example nav occupy all three columns and not just the the center medium column so now I wanted our nav to occupy all three columns I can just give it the class of grid Excel wait a minute what's what's going on we've got this gap right here well that's actually boma trying to help us out almost trying to make everything pretty but in this case it's adding padding and we don't want it it's interrupting the design what we can do this would new is padding less here so this tells the section to not have its own padding there we go right now it's occupying all three so that's great and let's go ahead and turn this off and now it's just occupying the the content column it looks like we can keep the vertical padding it's just the horizontal padding that that we don't care for so let's go ahead and make our own class because it doesn't exist in Omaha but we'll just make it real quick so we say is padding less horizontal we'd say padding left I mean right right okay and then let's see what happens oh I just realized we mistyped hang on okay it's better now all right so we created the class and now it's occupying the full width which is really really what we want we want to have a hundred percent control of the layout in this case now we're gonna have a problem which is our content doesn't hug the wall but our image does ooh how do we do with that well it's actually pretty subtle something has the class of grid excel we just don't care about it but in general we want it to have a small gutter so the way that we can do this is very subtle right we put a extra column right here and right here now no matter what there will always be a 1.5 RM which valuates I think 24 pixels there always be a gutter to the left and the right of our content column and then the one if R is just the the remainder space so check this out it's really it's really amazing right so we load up the web page and now we've got that gutter so so that's good and then we go ahead and put grid excel and then it's gone so it's really that easy for us to define the laying out using CSS grid and still embed it into our boma so we get the benefits of both CSS grid and OMA next we're going to learn how to make this author thing at the top and then we'll make the title and I'll see you in the next screencast hey you will come back ooh now that we're code gods we're ready to ready to move on and we're gonna start with the title of these all right the author at the top then we're gonna do the the title under that so how do we how do we do this well if you recognize a pattern here that's good we're going to use the media class the media component again because it makes simple how do we do the icon or the image at the at the left and then a title and then a paragraph to the right so one difference though is that we're gonna have this icon or the image in the center right you can't hit here but if we had multiple lines we would still want that image to be centered so we'll learn how to do that too and we're ready to go ahead and grab the media component and one thing is that this will belong in its own section so we'll grab that too all right and then one thing that we'll want to do is it's pretty much safe to assume that we can use this again and we can use grid here again as well if we wanted to refactor this we could go into here and then make a rule for section to automatically get rid of the padding left in the padding right so that we didn't have to put it here every time but for now I'm just gonna put that like this so here we go right here we're gonna put an image so I'll grab the class for that component for that do this one all right there I change this to 64 by 64 and there isn't a class for every size it's just that this is there's a few predefined classes 64 is one of them so I'm not there's not like a 65 by 65 and so on and so forth all right and then here we'll swap out the image new images and we're gonna grab the which one was it me me me me me me me JPEG okay great now for the content the content what we'll do is put this in a paragraph and then let's see we got zenok okay so let's put that in real quick all right so we have a strong tag to make a bold we have a link that goes nowhere right now then I'm gonna force the text this text to be gray so to do that I've got it wrapped inside of a span and then I've given it the class it has text grade to just force to be a bit lighter then I'm just using a break to break to the next line because it belongs to the same paragraph and then here this is definitely recommended we're using the time element so that search engines can basically document when this when the intended publication date was so for this I've just put the same date as I have that I published this article so that was April April 20th all right and the rest is pretty simple by the way this is not the bullet character it's actually I think I'm saying a right interpunct right this is an octave thorpe so alright wait so let's see how this looks nice now you'll note if you are OCD like me that the image is not in the center right we've got that little gap and Neath but not above so how do we deal with that to feel a little while to figure this out but it's pretty simple we're gonna make a general use class that we can use and I'm gonna call it Center which this will use flexbox so we just got flex here and then I'm going to Center horizontally and vertically if you were asleep earlier we did this like a few screencasts ago so this really isn't anything new do where do we put that know where we can actually put it as right here the reason is is because we're going to Center not just the figure but the text too because the text is taller than the figure the text will not actually have a gap above or beneath it but because the figure is shorter than the text the figure will have a gap above and beneath it now huh all right we'll turn out the debugger and that's one problem solved but we have one more not this huge gap up here and you might like that I don't so the way that we deal with that again is the padding here because we've started a new section Balma basically said hey I think I want you to have some padding where's gonna be lips it's gonna be a little dirty here and just can mine that out all right so now we've got that nice even gap above and below the nav and then the other part really looks ideal now on for the title I don't know that this is the most idiomatic way to do this it's just sort of what I worked out and put something inside of a div ID of it we'll do an h1 and h2 remember I want to give this style and give them a class of title and subtitle remember there's modifiers to change the size so I'll have this Cascade I'll do is and then is 3 and here do how to build yeah that's great let's take a look Oh so when I came up with was this well we know that sections will go ahead and give us some padding why don't we just use a section class here we don't need to use the section element because that's not semantically correct this isn't really a new section but we can borrow the properties from section to style this very consistently so I just grab this and voila alright let's see how it looks on a mobile device not bad we'll do some things later to make the text appear a little bit smaller so that it fits better but other than that it looks great alright in the next screencast we're going to figure out how to do our images which are gorgeous and then we're going to go and do the content in the screencast after all right I will see you very very soon hey welcome back we've got this beautiful blog design and now we're ready for these really nice images so what's that about well what we can do is go to the docs and we're gonna grab the columns like we used before yeah and then looking here I've got three so do three columns we're going to do three columns so do okay we have our three columns inside of each column there's going to be an image which could be a link it could be just an image that's fine and then we'll have a caption at the bottom alright so we'll grab the image class and then that goes inside of each of these I will remove this guy from now and then with you up three images right here it's gonna be blog one through three okay let's see what happens all right hang on right images yeah ooh yeah it's okay so we forgot to make this a grid excel right how's that look hey looks okay so one thing that we can do in boma is use the remember how we use notification before to give sort of a background well there's a few more that we can use there's box and card I really like card so we use it here and that'll give us that little nice line and a very very subtle shadow beneath it so that's the effect that we have here all right and then I'll just add a card to each of these yeah so you've got this gap which is a bit weird and then we had this other problem we're on a mobile device we probably would like this in general but for images we just want it to be wide the whole time okay let's go and get rid of the gap first so there's a feature called is variable which has its own modifier I think it's like one through a few maybe one two three four and if we use zero that will turn off the gap now if I want to increase that just little bit one or two or three let's do two yeah so this is a really nice feature if you don't want to completely remove it just partly remove it all right so we're gonna make this zero and yeah that looks really cool how do we deal with this there's another modifier that we can use for columns because columns are such an essential component God is mobile I want you to keep your aesthetic whether you're on a mobile or a desktop device really quite simple and again the reason that this isn't going full with here is because of the container if we really didn't like that it wouldn't be hard for us to just remove it all right and let's go ahead and add a figure caption below do you think caption a caption you know what I'm gonna make this a figure so that it's easier and then we can just make these good as for now instead now I want this to be small and Volman eise's that so no problem and then what was the text it was like that and you don't need to quit because you're already here good stewards of the Internet let's gonna make these links that go nowhere okay and then over here let's who happens so okay I think we know what we can do right we could put the class center here all of our problems go away yeah that's not bad and then let's just see how this would look with some content beneath it so just do you like yeah right we need a we need a we need some we need some space there so what we needs is because this doesn't belong to boma boma isn't giving us any any special treatment instead the Bommel way to do this might be to use level allows you to align content along level this is just indicating that anything in it needs to belong anywhere on the left the center or the right and then here I can make this a level item now basically saying I want this thing to be a level and then we have one item so this should be centered and because the belongs to MoMA he knows how to give us that breathing room that we so desire right before the concent was hugging it and that was an ideal yeah so we now we had that little space right there and then let's make the text a little bit lighter du has text gray and then the last thing is there's for me I'm really picky though I don't want this gap right here well if we inspect it eventually we'll find that that is a margin being applied so it's a market being applied to the columns what we can do is just say remember we use is penniless before well here I use is marginalists oh yeah that looks so cool and of course it's all responsive yeah all right I'll see you in the next screencast where we add this content and then we'll add a rule to make this a little bit smaller on a mobile device so that the content fits a bit better alright see you soon welcome back Internet now we're ready to add the content of our blog it'd be a pretty terrible blog we just kept it as is and it's beautiful but it's kind of useless so what we can do is in the documentation there is a class that we can use called content and you my friend have seen this before voila right you've seen this now content didn't do anything for us at the time because we just had a boring old paragraph but now we're gonna start to understand really how powerful content is and content becomes especially relevant if you want to use markdown in your websites because doing on these attributes all the time can be a bit annoying sometimes you just want the element to describe the content and for that to be enough and so content is a great example of this so let's do an h1 view and h2 right so note these don't have the title or the subtitle that we've used before which was necessary when we wanted to give this the style here these are just naked HTML elements when we load them up note that they do have a style and that's because content is helping us out here content is really magical because we basically don't have to worry about any of the trivial elements that we might want to use it's good for paragraphs for for lists whether they're ordered or unordered you've got your h's that i've showed you before we've got block quotes and even tables it's pretty awesome I'm gonna grab a really complete example from the website super complete and I'll show you what I mean wait there are no funny classes right I mean even have stuff like this where there's it's it's super right and then here we've got the sub four I mean it stands for so maybe submarine I don't know what that stands for okay well let's take a look whoa what so look at that right our blog is really gorgeous and we have to do so little work to get there now this let me just point that out that is my tabs screwing with the source code so here this is wrapped in a pre which means basically pre process don't cross us this text you want to have that hug the left wall where there's no no space to the left then that extra space we can fix that like that at least that's one way to fix it I'm sure there are others anyway this is really powerful the rate boma has done so much heavy lifting for us and all we had to use is HTML I think Tim bernerslee would be like extremely proud right now so anyway for for our website I'm gonna go ahead and just get rid of this instead I'll put the content yeah now check this out this is also why content is so powerful the content can scale so we can have medium content we can download content contents pretty miraculous I mean you can have different paragraphs in your website have different sizes and that's not just true for text it's true for all those elements that I showed you just a moment ago so boma is really freaking magical let's say you wanted to do like is large notification that's a really simple example of how we combine different bola moment classes to make like an advertisement or like a banner and then let's say we want to like style it right it's really crazy how powerful boma is anyway let's go ahead and just leave that I think this medium was good and that's it this is how you make a beautiful blog you know in a responsive sense it's not optimized I mean it is mobile but the text is a bit big so I'll show you a fascinatingly simple way that we can we can fix that make a media query which means I want you to override some code in this circumstance and the circumstance if we're rendering our website at some max width then consider the following rules so I'll say I want my route element to update its font size from the default of 16 pixels to say like like 414 let's just do a percent be like 90 percent 100 percent would be 16 pixel here 90% with not 14 but definitely easier on the eyes and then the circumstance is when I get to right here so we know that this is 624 and I need some way to say 624 plus these guys so I can say plus 1.5 REM so remember one REM is 16 pixels so 1.5 REM is 24 pixels and then we knew times 248 and then we do 6 24 plus 48 and then we can say 6 72 pixels all right now when we get to that when we cross over from a desktop or a tablet device to what we're calling a mobile device we get a slight update and everything that is defined with an e/m or in rem as its unit will also proportionally change to its really powerful if we wanted to go even further totally possible to that's it you've made a beautiful blog in like record time and it's ence responsive and we have like what the team lines of code it's crazy yeah so that's amazing now we're gonna go all the way up to a launch page I have stolen the Tesla Roadster page and then made it our own using boma believe it or not this will also be responsive and we're gonna do it with again very little code all right enough talk let's get into it I'll see you in the next screencast hey welcome back I'm pretty excited I'm not gonna say much about this we're just gonna get started alright so we're gonna use a hero I'm gonna drop the hero body I'm just gonna start with that alright let's take a look with the debugger turned on and ah it's not occupying any height so for that we can do is full height remember we do that pretty recently when we were designing this webpage here we have its full height and then here we just removed it so for this website you can imagine that we just have a hero and it has a modifier of is full height okay let's take a look now it's a darker color right if I remove that it's a little lighter and that's because it's a darker color on top of our whole website that being the hero okay so we can start to fill in the background so in our images we've got one two and three and we're going to use multiple images because we want our website to look different on a mobile or a tablet device so this is actually a different image than this one I mean it's the same picture but they've the the tesla team has edited it so that it's optimized for a mobile or a tablet device I'm going to do the same here so all we need to do is target the hero I want to say you have a background and Lee a background of images and then 0 1 right see what happens oh hang on the debugger is overriding the background yeah the first time this happened I thought my screen was dirty yeah it's the pictures huge right so we need to let's Center it all right so we need to go a bit further when you use something called cover which means I want this image to basically want the image to fit inside of our websites browser yeah that looks really good and it is responsive in a sense but the problem is is that on mobile devices it's just too narrow we we can't see the car it just doesn't look ideal so to fix that what we can do is use a media query actual Renee is two that are max that are max with is a thousand 24 pixels or we're 768 pixels then wanted to display a different background and we just update that let's take a look hey we move a yeah missing the hero okay yeah so that actually does look better right alright so there is the desktop right and we get to a tablet changes a little bit and then on a mobile device that changes even more so the point is that these images are optimized for different devices and that's great we'll get a better experience as a result now you might have noticed when I was changing the the widths you might have seen it like a flash of white well that's because the background behind the image will default to white if we're not explicit we want that to be black which i think is a bit more a bit more brand we can just do this and while we're waiting for an image to load as we're changing the width we'll get a stroke of black yeah so now we get like a stroke of black if our image is still loading which i think is just a little bit better than white so that's it for this screencast and the next one will focus on the the navigation bar at the top which of course will be mobile but in a different sense we're gonna hide some content in the event that we're on a mobile device all right I'll see you very soon hey welcome back now we're going to add that nap bar at the top and it's going to require some extra CSS so I have these helpers here and we're going to link to them like this so it's not that different than the way that we've linked our debugger it's actually the same but looking at our helpers we have a few things that we need to add in order to make this work you're familiar with Center that's nothing new but now instead of just centering an element inside of another one when you put it at the top the right the bottom and the left so that's nice and we have this special case where by default Flex Direction sets to row and in the event that we want it to set to column then we can just use center column instead might be wondering what the heck does that mean well looking at this the elements are following each other across a row whereas here they're following each other across a column so this is an example where if we want the elements to fall vertically we can say Center column and that will still Center Center the element inside of a column all right these just make this stuff work and then down here this is how we can have a single single space text and here this is if we want to hide something if we're on a mobile device so at a thousand 24 pixels anything that has a class of desktop I want it to just disappear all right so now we can add that nav bar and to do that we're gonna go into our Docs if I want to grab this guy instead of body we're going to use head here okay now the way that I thought of this design is to have this split into three columns so I have the left the center and then the right column over here we know how to do that just go to grab the columns and then we put that there and we know we'll have three so I'll just put this like this now remember when we're on a mobile device it's gonna stack the columns so to fix that we can just put is mobile and I found that if we put is margin list it'll look a lot prettier right it's just very simple now so now I'm going to fill in the valley with some texts for now this hey cool so our elements are falling vertically and we don't want that we effectively want them to fall horizontally if you remember a moment ago one of our helpers well these helpers do that because flex direction is set to row by default that's exactly what we want in fact we can just leave that there and it won't do anything at all I'll just put the center here and that actually centers the elements inside of their parent easy enough we can just make that left and right cool it's looking better now to deal with the fact that the text is just too close I found that there is a class just for this purpose so use nav bar found that there's a class to do with this so commute now our item mount will space it out real nicely so we just put that everywhere hey great this is looking phenomenal now on a mobile device we still have the trouble of having all this data so the way that we can deal with it is we'll just put desktop here remember remember that's this one here saying at thousand 24 pixels or less hide the content instead of putting it here for it for shop and signin we want to keep this button here so instead you can put desktop there and that was really easy okay now really all that's left is just style so all that's really left is basically the icon and then the style so the style is actually pretty easy everything is a heading and it has a text weight of fold we also want the text to be black and I found I can't just put has text black here it doesn't work so instead we're gonna be a bit lazy and just put it right here so again if we wanted to we could just refactor this in the style or even go all the way to Beaumont and customize it for our needs but for now just do it this way alright that's looking really good let's swap out the text here and the text here with the right image and icon so we know so for so we're familiar enough so we're familiar enough with how to do that so we know how to do that we just grab that and we go to here and I want to keep our item and I don't need will link our logo which is right here and you'll note that it's gonna be like crazy it's because it's rendering the SVG's height and width and not the desired height and width I'm just gonna inline this for now and we can say height one REM which kind of works but the width is still way too big you can see that here but a fix that I worked out that the width to the height was six point two five that's great and now we just need to deal with the hamburger so we just copied that put it here and then there is a font awesome icon for this now you'll note that the text is grayish so should we say it has text black and let's just make sure it's all good you might be wondering why is the height changing so again what we'll do is we can give it a fixed width and height make it one two one and let's take a look so we got the the boundaries right but here it's just doing something funny found that if we put the center here all of our problems go away let's take a look all right now to emulate that this is active go to a rope stir and make that way I believe that there's an is active class that you can use or you can make your own style or you can do this your own way I just want to show you the fastest way that you could so I want to show you I just want to show you the fastest way that you could emulate that design now unfortunately I don't have enough time to make this interactive but we will finish this responsive and all alright I'll see you in the next screencast hey welcome back so our sites awesome and now we're going to add in the Tesla and roadster text that you see at the top to do that I'm gonna add a hero body and then we're gonna have an each one and in h2 whoops and you can probably work out how we style this right we just do and actually let's do subtitle here because the text is smaller not bigger and then we'll put title here yeah so just put this in a good for now I don't know what you're doing just put it in a div okay so this works all the same alright so the point is we want to have this up at the top and we want it to be centered so what we need to do is basically override override where is fault where it falls on the page and there's a general class that we can use to to deal with this so we can view is overlay which means it's position is independent from the content on the page so even though I've got content here the fact that it's overlaid on top just ignores that so it's a good start and there is a modifier has text centered to center the text and then you can kind of work out that we just need to just shift it down a bit so we can use style top and 82 was right now note I'm not using p.m. or REM here because I want the height to always be the same whether we're on a mobile device or not let's take a look so yeah that looks great so we turn off the debugger and I guess all that's left is this gap in between and the the text color itself I think you know how to do this right we could just say hey wait a minute I know how to do that just do has text in black there how that worked and would use single spaced here similar space what do you single spaced here remember our helper we had single space to find because I have this other version of it it doesn't matter where we define it we can put it here or we can put it up here so the asterisk is really vital here okay so now that content pretty much hugs each other which is what we want and then finally I want this to be a little bit lighter so instead of changing the color let's change the the text wave it has text weight light and yeah that gives us sort of a nice aesthetic all right that one was easy now last we're gonna do this like complicated thing at the bottom and I was like super intimidated when I went to Tesla and was like how do I do that turns out that this is actually pretty intuitive if we use grid I'm sure there's a way that you could use flexbox but I found that grid was basically the most expressive way to solve this problem that's it for this screencast see you in the final screencast hey welcome back so our site it's freaking awesome but it's missing the specs at the bottom they're kind of intricate they're a responsive design is not like anything we've seen so far so you might be feeling a bit intimidated now how do you possibly do this and do that in like 10 minutes or less and the thing is if you have the right tool it can be a lot easier than you imagined so what we're gonna do is use CSS grid here so I have a link to a file called grid and over here I have it defined it's just empty when you use grid to create this design and it's going to be a lot easier than I think you might imagine let's go ahead and create our hero's foot do like this and like a main instead would be footer but it's up to you and we're going to follow the format that we did before so we have everything inside of a div just inside of the parent so here is where we can define our grid and I'm going to use an ID for this it could be a class but doesn't really matter at least not right now now looking at this design I want you to imagine that this is four columns and two rows I want you to imagine that this is four columns and two rows so you have one two three four for the columns and then here you have two rows right so you have one and two and beyond that you have five elements you have one two three four and five all right so we'll create five gifts I love so a b c d e so if we go to our grid okay so now let's turn on the let's turn on the debugger okay so you can see the foot is trying to exist here but there's just nothing to show all right so we'll put some content yeah all right so let's constrain the grid to say with 768 and then let's Center here because that will Center its child which is the grid cool and let's just add a padding around here okay cool so now it's got like this little gap beneath it which is like we have here you a grid like this and then display grid set of grid template columns for interview areas so areas are pretty amazing if you remember we have four columns and two rows so in terms of IDs this is a B C D and E and so what we want is to say it that a occupies all four columns in the first row and then BCDE each occupy one column but span the entire row I think I said that right all right so here's how we can do that and say eh eh eh eh so this is one row and then four columns here we can say we c d e alright let's see what happens we've got the text at the top and then these would each be these specs now on a mobile device this won't do anything fancy but I bet you have an idea of how we can do that we can say at media max with 512 pixels and say grid when an override grid template areas it's astonishing how simple this is all we need to do is remove a column and add a row that's it I know I know it's crazy it's who happens so on a mobile device you can see how the reserve now is at the bottom and the specs are in the center and then the text is at the top and then that changes depending on what we're looking at the rest of this is really just aesthetics so what we can do is we can say hey I want the rose to have a gap you say grid row gap one REM that gives us a nice break in between and I think you know what to do now the rest is really just titles subtitles and an icon so I'm gonna go in and paste them in because it is pretty cumbersome but I bet you'll understand all of it once I put it here so there it is and let's just talk about it real quick so one of the things that you'll note is that we're using contact column because I want the text here to be on top of each other if we used Center which is flex direction row it flows left to right and so to fix that we just say center column take a look you'll you'll recognize all of this code now we have a paragraph has text centered has text white here we have a paragraph with an icon inside of it here I've got this speed icon has text gray light we set a fixed width in a fixed height which is just a little bit smaller than the text and we can use modifiers so we have bearing size text right we have 1.9 as big and then small we have s and that's because of the and that's because we're changing the size with the modifier is size 5 for the reserve Now button that's really just a link it has some modifiers and I set the width to a hundred so that always occupies the available width and really that's all there is to it the thing is with boma you can really rapidly prototype and the code is fairly idiomatic so I really hope you enjoyed this course please please share this if you think it was valuable and if you want to reach out to me and if you want to reach out to me hit me up on Twitter right here you can click my face otherwise yeah congratulations you are now a Bowman ninja happy coding see ya
