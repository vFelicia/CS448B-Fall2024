00:00 - hey guys i'm reggie one of the
00:01 - co-founders of pennybox i look after
00:04 - products so everything from ui ux
00:06 - engineering code reviews managing the
00:08 - engineers uh feature sets testing i look
00:11 - after all that so today i'm going to
00:13 - give you a little insight into what i do
00:15 - day in day out so join me i'm working
00:18 - out of the common room in the apartment
00:20 - building i'm staying at here in san
00:22 - francisco
00:23 - i am
00:25 - going to be sitting here probably for
00:26 - the next couple of hours it's a really
00:28 - cool place
00:29 - there's a really cool
00:31 - uh common table here where you see a lot
00:34 - of startup people unfortunately today
00:35 - there's really no one around
00:37 - there is a camera crew here that's
00:38 - actually recording something for some
00:39 - reason or other but it's a nice facility
00:41 - you've got kitchen and there's a gym
00:43 - actually just over there if you can see
00:45 - it um
00:46 - going there at lunch times and workouts
00:48 - to clear my mind occasionally as a bit
00:50 - of an insight into some of the tools
00:51 - that we use here at pennybox in the
00:53 - product development process um so tools
00:55 - like sketch pivotal tracker slack for
00:58 - communications i'm sure a lot of
01:00 - startups use similar ones but these are
01:02 - the ones that we use it works really
01:03 - well for us
01:05 - and i'm going to run you through a
01:06 - couple now up here today very simple
01:09 - just got my mac out
01:11 - and obviously the most important thing
01:12 - coffee
01:14 - i want to show you first of sketch we
01:16 - sketch for all of our design ui ux
01:19 - purposes um what i'm going to be doing
01:21 - today is i'm going to be changing this
01:23 - screen for the next version of the app
01:25 - so right now the profile screen for the
01:27 - child it shows their parents and doesn't
01:29 - really show much else so this is going
01:31 - into a version one beta release for the
01:34 - next version what we want to actually
01:35 - show is a transaction history of what
01:38 - the kid has actually earned the money
01:40 - for and what the tasks were so i'm going
01:42 - to go ahead and change the screen and
01:44 - i'll show you the final output
01:46 - so what i've done here now is i've taken
01:48 - a copy of this artboard
01:50 - which is the no activity version one and
01:53 - i've replicated over here so i keep most
01:55 - of the elements the same
01:56 - next thing i've done is added all of
01:58 - these elements so this basically has a
02:00 - scrolling history of all the tasks and
02:02 - activities the child has done and this
02:04 - will do for our purposes and this now
02:06 - goes to the engineer and they'll be able
02:09 - to code some of these elements in so
02:12 - we're going to have to create some
02:13 - back-end api calls
02:15 - to be able to handle this sort of
02:17 - information from our database
02:18 - so that's what we've done in sketch
02:20 - today very handy tool that we use which
02:23 - is in vision i think many of you would
02:25 - have come across or heard of envision at
02:26 - least envision is used for prototyping
02:28 - so click through screens that allows you
02:30 - to basically test with your users
02:33 - how responsive these screens are or how
02:35 - well the users are responding to it um
02:38 - it's a very handy tool and we actually
02:39 - use it in collaboration with sketch with
02:41 - a handy plug-in that envision provides
02:43 - called craft so i'll show you in a
02:45 - second
02:46 - how this works and how easy it is to
02:49 - upload basically your designs into
02:51 - envision and start prototyping on your
02:52 - vision this is envision
02:55 - as you can see we've got the screen that
02:56 - we're working on in sketch this is the
02:58 - original one that we had for the beta
03:00 - what i'm going to do is now go into
03:02 - sketch and over here on the right we've
03:05 - got a plug-in it's a plug-in called
03:07 - craft and it's extremely handy if you're
03:09 - trying to sync your uh your artboards
03:12 - from sketch over to envision it's very
03:15 - seamless integration allows you to
03:16 - basically push all of these um as as
03:20 - image files as pngs into envision
03:22 - otherwise you'd have to extract each one
03:23 - of these manually and upload it to
03:25 - envision which can take a lot of time so
03:27 - this is very handy i'm going to go ahead
03:29 - and upload
03:31 - this new screen that we've done
03:33 - into envision i'm going to show you how
03:34 - it looks on the envision site so this is
03:37 - the craft plugin that we've
03:39 - just opened up i've selected the
03:41 - artboard i don't want to sync all of the
03:43 - artboards to envision right now so i've
03:45 - just selected the artboard that we want
03:47 - to sync we've logged into envision
03:49 - already it's actually very easy to
03:51 - integrate we've logged into envision i'm
03:52 - going to pick penny box beta which is
03:54 - the um the prototype that we're
03:56 - uploading into only selected artboards
03:58 - and sync to envision
04:01 - we're back here now on vision and as you
04:02 - can see
04:04 - um this
04:06 - upload has been successful and it's come
04:08 - through into envision so i'm going to
04:09 - click through into it and it'll load
04:11 - and now i can go through and create my
04:14 - workflows here which will allow me to
04:17 - effectively link this up with the
04:19 - existing prototype and as you click
04:21 - through it you'll be able to see the new
04:23 - new mock-up of the screen that we've
04:24 - done in sketch
04:27 - so i just want to show you guys um our
04:29 - task management tool we use a tool
04:31 - called pivotal tracker it's very similar
04:33 - to jira in that it allows you basically
04:35 - to create tickets and track tasks um we
04:39 - like it a little bit better than jira
04:40 - with interiors a little bit too over
04:42 - complex for what we want to achieve and
04:44 - how we want to achieve it so we actually
04:45 - use people to be able to do this so just
04:48 - to explain some of the screens here so
04:49 - these are basically all the tasks that
04:50 - have been done to date um this is our
04:53 - current iteration and backlog so these
04:54 - are the tasks that are currently being
04:56 - done right now and this is the icebox
04:58 - the icebox is basically tasks that we've
05:00 - identified that need to be done and
05:02 - we've categorized them based on priority
05:04 - so once the stuff out of the backlog is
05:05 - done we'll pull these tasks into the
05:07 - backlog and we'll continue so right now
05:08 - you can see some accept and rejects here
05:11 - this is for media engineers um
05:13 - just recently committed a chunk of code
05:15 - and what i'm going to do now is pull up
05:17 - f code i'm going to pull the
05:20 - code out of bitbucket we use bitbucket
05:21 - for our code repository and i'm going to
05:24 - go through and do a quick code review
05:25 - pull it onto my iphone test device and
05:29 - i'm going to be able to test some of
05:30 - these um these engineering tasks that
05:32 - have been completed and then i can
05:34 - either accept them or reject them if
05:35 - they've been done according to the
05:37 - criteria that we've set some code
05:39 - reviewing of some of the commits that
05:41 - came through overnight um
05:44 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to
05:44 - show you our bitbucket repository this
05:47 - is where we store all of our code for
05:49 - the pennybox ios app um and from there
05:52 - i'm going to pull it out into xcode and
05:55 - load it onto my phone
05:56 - onto a test device so i'll show you that
05:59 - now so this is our bitbucket account um
06:02 - this is where we basically sync all of
06:04 - our code too so we've got three
06:06 - repositories here um once for our core
06:09 - api so this is all of our backend stuff
06:11 - this is for the front-end development
06:13 - and this is our gamification platform
06:14 - that we're developing alongside so i'm
06:16 - going to go into the front end um and
06:19 - you'll see that
06:21 - uh there isn't too much on this screen
06:23 - but we'll go to commits
06:25 - and this is where basically all the
06:26 - commits have come through um this is an
06:28 - engineer that's making commits um so
06:30 - what i'm going to do now is basically
06:32 - have a look at when the last commit was
06:35 - done was yesterday so we're going to go
06:37 - into xcode and basically pull this out
06:40 - so we're going to check out this code
06:50 - and we're going to pull it out of the
06:51 - back end implementation branch so we've
06:53 - got separate branches for different um
06:55 - levels of work that we're doing the
06:57 - different types of code changes that
06:59 - we're making or additions we're going to
07:01 - pull it back an implementation i know
07:02 - that's the one that we need
07:04 - i'm going to save it in
07:09 - annotated with today's date
07:13 - and we're going to download it
07:15 - okay so that's done and
07:18 - this is basically our code so
07:21 - you're getting a real preview into how
07:23 - we do all of our developments so this is
07:25 - basically all of our modules um what i'm
07:27 - going to do is basically run this in a
07:29 - release version
07:31 - and i'm going to connect
07:33 - my um
07:34 - my phone to it really soon but let's
07:37 - just uh
07:38 - for demonstrations sake run this on a
07:41 - iphone 6
07:43 - and this should pop up a simulator
07:45 - so this is going to be on screen it's
07:47 - not going to have some of the features
07:48 - that we'd like to test for example being
07:50 - able to use the hardware on a device
07:53 - that's why it's really important that we
07:55 - also test alongside
07:57 - the simulator with the real devices so
07:59 - we can see exactly how it looks how it
08:01 - how it behaves and how performs
08:04 - and
08:04 - when you do run it on devices you tend
08:06 - to also catch some logic bugs or issues
08:09 - that you wouldn't otherwise see in a
08:10 - simulator so we we always run a
08:13 - simulated version but alongside that we
08:15 - also run a real physical device version
08:18 - as well so the build is succeeded there
08:20 - and very shortly the simulator will pop
08:23 - up
08:26 - all right so paint boxes loaded and we
08:28 - come to long screen so let's just
08:31 - play around with this
08:33 - child anyway so i'm going to go through
08:35 - and test a number of engineering changes
08:37 - that have happened um i won't run you
08:39 - through uh all of our code base um but
08:42 - this is basically where all of it sits
08:43 - we've got different pods um different
08:46 - view controllers for different screens
08:47 - um it's all architected within xcode
08:51 - connecting off my iphone uh with um with
08:54 - my mac and what i'm going to do now is
08:56 - basically create a build um of this
08:59 - current version into the iphone and also
09:02 - onto the ipad so i can test on these
09:04 - devices i'm going to do that on xcode
09:07 - and push it through as a build so this
09:09 - actually circumvents um the need for
09:11 - test flight if you can navigate your way
09:13 - through xcode it's actually really handy
09:14 - because you can run built on devices um
09:17 - especially with your development team
09:19 - it's actually really easy to be able to
09:20 - do those on a frequent basis rather than
09:22 - having to upload to test flight
09:25 - we do use test flight we use it for um
09:28 - for internal and external testing with
09:30 - our users and families
09:31 - but as we're doing development
09:34 - and and to be able to track through the
09:37 - cycle um and as commits are done um so
09:40 - we can tick off on pivotal when tasks
09:41 - and tickets are completed um we just
09:44 - build it directly onto the iphone using
09:46 - xcode a very quick code review of the
09:49 - changes that were made
09:51 - bitbucket actually has an extremely
09:53 - handy section that allows you to look at
09:56 - the commits and what's been done
09:58 - this helps me to identify where the code
10:00 - changes have occurred so you can
10:02 - actually see a side side-by-side
10:03 - difference um to see where changes have
10:05 - been made so this is actually really
10:06 - handy
10:08 - and looking at this i know exactly which
10:10 - file to go into in xcode and where i'm
10:13 - actually reviewing
10:14 - the changes that have been made
10:16 - so this is a review that i've just
10:19 - completed i'm just about to upload it
10:20 - onto um
10:22 - uploaded build onto my iphone which is
10:24 - connected so this is a real device so
10:26 - it's not a simulator and i'm going to go
10:28 - ahead and
10:30 - create the built
10:32 - all right so xcode is telling me that
10:34 - it's about to run it on pinning on on
10:36 - the iphone
10:38 - and here it is
10:42 - so penny box now loaded so now i can go
10:44 - ahead and do um and complete my testing
10:48 - which i'm going to go through on both
10:50 - the iphone here and also the ipad in a
10:54 - very short period of time
10:59 - a break and heading off for lunch
11:01 - i'm in the mission bay area here in san
11:03 - francisco it's a beautiful day today now
11:05 - if you can see the sky it's a beautiful
11:07 - sunny day today going through a bit of a
11:08 - heatwave which is really nice so
11:11 - i'm gonna walk over now to a cafe near
11:13 - me and have a bit of a bite to eat and
11:15 - get back to it got back from lunch and
11:17 - we've got two ladies here from so
11:19 - bakeable.com
11:21 - doing some work here today
11:23 - what are you guys cooking up we're going
11:25 - to make beautiful rose champagne
11:28 - cupcakes ooh yum and i get to taste them
11:31 - afterwards right you do
11:34 - it's the end of the day i'm working away
11:36 - and i get nice little
11:40 - sweet surprises here
11:43 - so jocelyn what's what
11:45 - you've got a dark chocolate cookie that
11:48 - has a melty caramel center with flaky
11:51 - salt on top
11:52 - and then those are our chocolate whoopee
11:56 - chocolate whoopie-esque
11:58 - raspberry chocolate surprises
12:00 - um
12:03 - not bad at all
12:10 - it's got a chewy caramel center
12:13 - yum

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys i'm reggie one of the cofounders of pennybox i look after products so everything from ui ux engineering code reviews managing the engineers uh feature sets testing i look after all that so today i'm going to give you a little insight into what i do day in day out so join me i'm working out of the common room in the apartment building i'm staying at here in san francisco i am going to be sitting here probably for the next couple of hours it's a really cool place there's a really cool uh common table here where you see a lot of startup people unfortunately today there's really no one around there is a camera crew here that's actually recording something for some reason or other but it's a nice facility you've got kitchen and there's a gym actually just over there if you can see it um going there at lunch times and workouts to clear my mind occasionally as a bit of an insight into some of the tools that we use here at pennybox in the product development process um so tools like sketch pivotal tracker slack for communications i'm sure a lot of startups use similar ones but these are the ones that we use it works really well for us and i'm going to run you through a couple now up here today very simple just got my mac out and obviously the most important thing coffee i want to show you first of sketch we sketch for all of our design ui ux purposes um what i'm going to be doing today is i'm going to be changing this screen for the next version of the app so right now the profile screen for the child it shows their parents and doesn't really show much else so this is going into a version one beta release for the next version what we want to actually show is a transaction history of what the kid has actually earned the money for and what the tasks were so i'm going to go ahead and change the screen and i'll show you the final output so what i've done here now is i've taken a copy of this artboard which is the no activity version one and i've replicated over here so i keep most of the elements the same next thing i've done is added all of these elements so this basically has a scrolling history of all the tasks and activities the child has done and this will do for our purposes and this now goes to the engineer and they'll be able to code some of these elements in so we're going to have to create some backend api calls to be able to handle this sort of information from our database so that's what we've done in sketch today very handy tool that we use which is in vision i think many of you would have come across or heard of envision at least envision is used for prototyping so click through screens that allows you to basically test with your users how responsive these screens are or how well the users are responding to it um it's a very handy tool and we actually use it in collaboration with sketch with a handy plugin that envision provides called craft so i'll show you in a second how this works and how easy it is to upload basically your designs into envision and start prototyping on your vision this is envision as you can see we've got the screen that we're working on in sketch this is the original one that we had for the beta what i'm going to do is now go into sketch and over here on the right we've got a plugin it's a plugin called craft and it's extremely handy if you're trying to sync your uh your artboards from sketch over to envision it's very seamless integration allows you to basically push all of these um as as image files as pngs into envision otherwise you'd have to extract each one of these manually and upload it to envision which can take a lot of time so this is very handy i'm going to go ahead and upload this new screen that we've done into envision i'm going to show you how it looks on the envision site so this is the craft plugin that we've just opened up i've selected the artboard i don't want to sync all of the artboards to envision right now so i've just selected the artboard that we want to sync we've logged into envision already it's actually very easy to integrate we've logged into envision i'm going to pick penny box beta which is the um the prototype that we're uploading into only selected artboards and sync to envision we're back here now on vision and as you can see um this upload has been successful and it's come through into envision so i'm going to click through into it and it'll load and now i can go through and create my workflows here which will allow me to effectively link this up with the existing prototype and as you click through it you'll be able to see the new new mockup of the screen that we've done in sketch so i just want to show you guys um our task management tool we use a tool called pivotal tracker it's very similar to jira in that it allows you basically to create tickets and track tasks um we like it a little bit better than jira with interiors a little bit too over complex for what we want to achieve and how we want to achieve it so we actually use people to be able to do this so just to explain some of the screens here so these are basically all the tasks that have been done to date um this is our current iteration and backlog so these are the tasks that are currently being done right now and this is the icebox the icebox is basically tasks that we've identified that need to be done and we've categorized them based on priority so once the stuff out of the backlog is done we'll pull these tasks into the backlog and we'll continue so right now you can see some accept and rejects here this is for media engineers um just recently committed a chunk of code and what i'm going to do now is pull up f code i'm going to pull the code out of bitbucket we use bitbucket for our code repository and i'm going to go through and
