00:07 - hey everybody it's
00:09 - Jesse and
00:11 - um I am streaming from home today and uh
00:16 - if you if you saw the uh two other times
00:19 - where I tried to stream from home you
00:20 - know that the quality is not good so um
00:25 - I I adjusted my settings a
00:27 - lot I don't expect the quality to be
00:30 - good but hopefully the the buffering is
00:33 - a little bit
00:34 - better uh so I'm also today I'm going to
00:37 - try to keep this uh a little bit short
00:41 - and I'm going to do some things that are
00:43 - less code intensive and there'll be more
00:45 - visual feedback you know on the actual
00:47 - website and that should be a little bit
00:49 - easier to see with the decreased quality
00:52 - uh so
00:53 - normally you know I would do this uh
00:57 - from my office
00:58 - unfortunately
01:00 - uh
01:05 - my actually looks like I'm seeing from
01:07 - the live chat the volume is really low
01:09 - as well so let
01:11 - me let me see if I can do anything about
01:15 - that
01:17 - um
01:21 - so my employer has blocked all access to
01:26 - GitHub which which I I mean I really
01:30 - can't I can't work very well without
01:33 - that
01:35 - so I'm going to try to do a stream here
01:38 - I'm
01:39 - hoping that by next week we get access
01:43 - again uh otherwise I just I
01:48 - will I'll be working from home a lot so
01:51 - I can access GitHub I won't have a lot
01:56 - of
01:58 - um
02:00 - I don't know I won't have a lot of time
02:01 - in the office to be able to stream so
02:03 - I'll have to figure something out um
02:05 - maybe I can definitely do pre-recorded
02:10 - videos um I see yeah I'm working on the
02:13 - I'm working on the volume
02:14 - now I'm not sure what the problem
02:18 - is okay I found it now is that better at
02:23 - all uh the
02:28 - volume oh
02:30 - wait a second for a response
02:32 - here um yeah I'll expl so um I got some
02:36 - questions why would they block GitHub
02:39 - so so you guys have heard the uh like
02:42 - the Peta ransomware thing that's going
02:46 - on uh it's not really ransomware I guess
02:48 - they're saying now it just is a a wiper
02:51 - um
02:54 - so okay is it better now yeah actually
02:57 - in in my sound settings so in in OBS
03:00 - that's my streaming software the sound
03:02 - settings were fine but in the actual
03:03 - settings for my Mac somehow the input
03:07 - volume for the microphone got turned
03:09 - almost completely down and I'm not sure
03:11 - how that happened I don't remember doing
03:13 - that
03:14 - but
03:16 - um but that happened that actually makes
03:19 - sense because yesterday I was doing a
03:20 - Skype meeting with this this laptop and
03:24 - um they were having trouble
03:27 - hearing uh people talking so that's
03:31 - probably the reason but anyway um
03:34 - so someone in the IT department is on a
03:38 - list serve and someone on that list
03:40 - serve emailed out to everybody that they
03:43 - had actually seen this virus this this
03:46 - Peta or not Peta whatever they're
03:48 - calling it now they'd seen it when it
03:50 - first got you know started to uh do its
03:54 - work and they noticed that they
03:56 - downloaded something from
03:58 - GitHub and that was the the only message
04:01 - right so based on that they shut down
04:04 - GitHub uh luckily one of my co-workers
04:07 - alerted me to that on Wednesday so I
04:10 - didn't even bother coming in that's why
04:12 - I didn't do a stream on
04:14 - Wednesday
04:16 - yesterday it they had
04:19 - reactivated they they unblocked it so I
04:21 - could get access to it so yesterday I
04:23 - was actually able to go in the office
04:24 - but then I had during my normal stream
04:26 - time I had a really long meeting uh um
04:30 - and then even earlier on I I had some
04:32 - meetings early in the day so my whole
04:34 - day was taken up so I couldn't do a
04:36 - stream like I wanted to stream yesterday
04:37 - but I just didn't hadn't have the time
04:40 - so then I went into work
04:42 - today and the first thing I always do is
04:44 - try to do a get pool and it wouldn't
04:47 - work and so then I tried to do tried to
04:50 - go on GitHub and it wouldn't work so I
04:53 - called over uh to the IT department and
04:56 - they had in fact blocked GitHub again
04:59 - and uh when when I asked how long it
05:00 - would be they said oh not that long and
05:02 - I I said well were we talking like days
05:04 - and they said yeah hopefully just days
05:08 - so evidently they're waiting for their
05:11 - antivirus software to come out with an
05:15 - update that protects them against this
05:17 - ransomware and when that update comes
05:19 - out then they will unblock
05:22 - GitHub so that's the story so I'm I
05:27 - really this really stink
05:30 - because I have a lot of work to do and I
05:33 - also want to
05:36 - stream uh I haven't streamed that much
05:38 - lately this week and I I miss it I miss
05:41 - all you guys uh and girls
05:44 - and uh so hopefully this all gets
05:47 - resolved and I can get back to my normal
05:49 - streaming and you don't have to suffer
05:50 - through this terrible quality uh video
05:54 - stream um unless unless I could find
05:57 - somewhere else that has better internet
05:58 - that I could go to to work then maybe
06:01 - but I there's not really any like
06:03 - workplaces I'm I live in a small City so
06:07 - there's just not really a good place
06:09 - that has great Wi-Fi that I can go to
06:11 - work but if I can find one I will
06:13 - hopefully it won't come to that and I
06:15 - can just go into the office and do it so
06:21 - anyway
06:25 - um okay I see everybody in the live chat
06:27 - now hey hey everyone
06:34 - um
06:36 - so I have a a lot of of news so the uh
06:39 - we are going to go over some CSS changes
06:42 - uh today I thought that would just be
06:44 - simple given the uh bad quality of the
06:46 - stream it'll be way easier to see what's
06:49 - going on uh but I just want to give you
06:52 - an overview uh the site's going to be
06:54 - undergoing some major changes in some
06:56 - parts of it so I want to give you a
06:57 - quick overview of what's going to happen
06:59 - I'm going to try to stream as much of it
07:01 - as I can and also I'd like your input on
07:04 - some things uh I will
07:07 - say um I probably only have maybe I
07:12 - think until
07:13 - July around July 19th I need to be
07:17 - pulled off of this project and go to
07:19 - another project so everything that's
07:20 - going to happen needs to happen by July
07:23 - 15th so in addition to what we were
07:25 - already working on before the the
07:27 - biggest thing that I was working on that
07:29 - needs to happen is I need to get all the
07:31 - content of the entire site to be
07:33 - editable from WordPress so I need to be
07:37 - able to pull in all that content either
07:39 - in one API call or figure out how to
07:41 - make multiple API calls with nextjs and
07:45 - how they do their server side rendering
07:47 - so but that's maybe I'll do a video
07:49 - about that um so I have some ideas
07:53 - hopefully I'll get to that so here's
07:54 - what's going to
07:55 - change I'm just going to go through
07:57 - really quickly the change changes the
07:59 - most major changes uh the the really
08:02 - long meeting that I had yesterday was
08:03 - all about changes that need to happen to
08:06 - this site so what we're going to do is
08:08 - we're going to make this whole section
08:10 - smaller so this was pretty like our hero
08:13 - section but it's it's going to become
08:15 - more of just a really big nav basically
08:19 - so this is going to shrink up a bit this
08:22 - will get smaller this text here will get
08:26 - smaller this text and this low logo will
08:29 - get larger now I'm not sure about the
08:31 - size of this logo if I can even make it
08:34 - larger without it getting pixelated so I
08:36 - have to check I think I might be like at
08:38 - the upper end of the range here so uh
08:41 - we'll see maybe maybe I can get a better
08:44 - quality um image that I could make
08:48 - bigger uh so and this is all based uh I
08:52 - got a ton of feedback from several
08:55 - different people that are in this
08:57 - department this kakal institute
08:58 - Department so um I can't really these
09:03 - are pretty much Set uh since I it wasn't
09:06 - really my call for a lot of this stuff
09:07 - although I I did have my input um a lot
09:11 - of this is kind of set so we can't can't
09:13 - really change it the other thing that
09:14 - needs to change is this bar here needs
09:17 - to get a little taller and this text
09:20 - needs to be a larger font size and maybe
09:23 - even a heavier font weight we'll see how
09:25 - that
09:26 - looks um now this is Big this looks
09:30 - terrible now um be just the um where the
09:36 - video was stopped at I was playing the
09:38 - video I guess it a low quality but
09:39 - basically let me do a refresh just so
09:42 - you could see what the thumbnail is for
09:45 - this video there's going to be a full
09:46 - screen video section so this will be a
09:49 - lot smaller so you'll be able to see
09:50 - like half of this and you're going to
09:52 - scroll down and this is a full screen
09:54 - video um I don't know if we'll stick
09:56 - with the YouTube INB bed or if I'll
09:58 - actually pull in the video um but it's
10:01 - going to be click to play I'm not going
10:03 - to autoplay it but this is a video
10:05 - introduction from the head of the kakal
10:08 - Institute that's who the site's for um
10:12 - does like a voice over uh so the we have
10:15 - a videographer in my department who's
10:17 - pretty really good and and he put this
10:19 - together so we're going to put this here
10:23 - uh this section which I had added is is
10:26 - not going to be
10:28 - included um after we we had to talk more
10:31 - about what the goals of the website are
10:34 - which we should have known this from the
10:37 - outset but I think it just took a while
10:38 - for everyone to get really figure out
10:41 - what they wanted this website to do so
10:45 - we moved the mission statement down here
10:47 - instead of it having its own section the
10:49 - quote that was here is actually
10:51 - mentioned in the video so it'll still
10:53 - get in there this section here this
10:55 - formation section is going to be moved
10:57 - up above so so it'll be video the
11:01 - formation section with the four cards
11:04 - and then the mission below it and then
11:07 - below that we'll have announcements like
11:09 - we still we have here and then we're
11:11 - going to add a contact form and then
11:14 - just our normal footer so the homepage
11:16 - is undergoing very significant changes
11:19 - uh there
11:21 - are the about page is going to have uh
11:24 - some links to some informational Pages
11:28 - uh so there I'm just going to have to
11:30 - change it a little bit to include a
11:31 - section there that can display links so
11:33 - I'm not no no use in actually checking
11:35 - that page out at this point
11:38 - the let me let me check the chat real
11:41 - quick in case someone had um some
11:43 - comments on
11:45 - this
11:49 - um
11:53 - okay okay I can see I did have some
11:55 - comments about the whole like GitHub
11:57 - being being blocked thing uh Grayson
12:00 - says uh I can see from a security
12:04 - perspective it makes sense it does get
12:06 - in the way it workflow but I don't want
12:07 - data L yeah um I don't know that it
12:10 - realizes how much I use GitHub and um
12:13 - the the one other person that does um
12:16 - this kind of work in my department uses
12:18 - GitHub uh because it doesn't use GitHub
12:21 - they use some really um old form of
12:25 - Version
12:26 - Control uh it's like a propri AR system
12:29 - I forget what it's called
12:32 - like they were using visual Source
12:35 - visual Source safe or something and now
12:37 - they're using like some Vault thing I
12:39 - don't really know but for them it wasn't
12:41 - a big deal to block it because they
12:42 - never use it uh
12:45 - so yeah I still think the best thing for
12:48 - them to do would be to make sure that
12:50 - all their stuff has the uh the upgrade
12:52 - for the SMB V1 which is from what I
12:55 - understand what that virus is is using
12:58 - uh to do
12:59 - to to get in and actually uh infect
13:03 - everything it seems to me from what I've
13:05 - read if if you have that installed then
13:07 - you should be fine
13:10 - but
13:16 - um let
13:25 - see okay um Emanuel asks why not just
13:30 - make it a WordPress theme and I I know
13:33 - we've gone over this before but I like
13:35 - keep getting that question and uh the
13:37 - reason the reason basically is uh this
13:39 - is using react right now um it's late
13:44 - it's too late in the game to change it
13:45 - to Wordpress theme anyway um but uh
13:49 - there are some advantages to doing it
13:52 - this way as opposed to a traditional
13:53 - WordPress theme and um I'm actually I I
13:58 - don't think I'm not going to go through
13:59 - it all because I know I've done it in
14:00 - past videos but I'll let some people in
14:02 - the live chat fill fill you in on the uh
14:05 - the advantages but basically at this
14:09 - point it just there's no way I could
14:11 - convert this into a WordPress theme fast
14:14 - enough uh for when I need to have this
14:16 - all
14:17 - done um let's
14:23 - see okay John Hansen says uh could
14:27 - convert the uh
14:29 - the logo that's a
14:31 - PNG uh into an
14:34 - SVG and says it works great fairly quick
14:37 - to do all right awesome I hadn't even
14:38 - thought of that but that is a great idea
14:40 - so uh I'll give that if I need to I'll
14:43 - give that a try I do prefer to use svgs
14:45 - whenever I can
14:49 - anyway
14:51 - um Sebastian says well Chrome and kerski
14:55 - decided that YouTube was not
14:57 - secure uh yeah I
15:02 - don't yeah Scott's giving
15:05 - some
15:07 - um some other options for what source
15:10 - control they use TFS IBM uh subversion
15:13 - it's not
15:16 - subversion it might be TFS I don't know
15:20 - I guess it it doesn't matter really but
15:22 - uh I it's definitely not it's not the
15:25 - IBM moment and it's not subversion uh
15:27 - they did use like the old Microsoft
15:30 - one and um that's like not supported
15:35 - anymore uh but they've I'm pretty sure
15:37 - they've switched off of that one onto
15:39 - this new one uh so anyway I'll continue
15:42 - on the the only other section that is
15:46 - getting major changes is the resource
15:48 - section also the event section the uh
15:50 - the geolocation stuff is now live and I
15:53 - do want to thank um
15:56 - Patrick because he submitted two pool
15:59 - requests uh that were kind of in
16:01 - relation to that section let me
16:04 - see
16:09 - um I wonder if he's on uh I just want to
16:12 - bring up the uh contributor section here
16:14 - just to give credit to
16:17 - everyone uh who's been contributing so
16:21 - here we go so uh thanks I zoom in on
16:24 - that a bit I know the quality is bad so
16:27 - hopefully you can see that but uh here's
16:29 - everyone who's contributed this uh so
16:31 - far and I really really appreciate uh
16:35 - all your contributions they've made this
16:36 - so much better than it would have been
16:38 - and I've learned so much from going
16:41 - through uh your code that you've
16:43 - submitted and uh I've already uh I was I
16:47 - was working on just some some little
16:49 - side projects some fun projects uh when
16:51 - I was on vacation and uh I was going
16:54 - back to your pool requests that you all
16:56 - submitted and uh figuring out how
16:59 - everything was done so that I could do
17:01 - it that way on my newer projects uh so
17:04 - really awesome I really appreciate
17:06 - that uh let me go is my resources
17:11 - working there we go uh so the right now
17:15 - the resources section uh is not it's not
17:19 - working exactly as expected the the idea
17:21 - was that it would be it would look kind
17:24 - of like Pinterest right but Pinterest
17:27 - has IM for everything and as you can see
17:30 - there's only one image right now the
17:33 - problem is a lot of the images for these
17:35 - were just way too small and look
17:36 - terrible when they were actually in here
17:40 - uh
17:41 - so the layout for this is going to
17:43 - completely change uh so just
17:47 - briefly uh these will probably stay here
17:50 - and the search will stay here somewhere
17:52 - in the middle and the search might get
17:54 - smaller maybe somewhere in the middle
17:55 - there's just going to be a toggle
17:56 - between free and paid resource ources so
17:59 - it's just going to toggle back and forth
18:00 - I may or may not even keep an icon that
18:03 - denotes whether something's free or paid
18:06 - uh because we'll just have the toggle I
18:08 - I'll see I basically there's probably
18:12 - not going to be a view that includes
18:14 - both free and paid resources together so
18:18 - it may not even be necessary to have
18:19 - this icon we're going to have a drop
18:22 - down here that has a ton of categories
18:25 - the the example given that I'm so
18:29 - basically the people who are in charge
18:31 - of the this institute that I'm doing the
18:33 - website for they want it to be like
18:36 - Amazon okay so
18:38 - basically in the next like two weeks
18:41 - maybe three weeks uh I'm going to try to
18:43 - turn
18:44 - this into Amazon as closely as I
18:48 - can and
18:50 - uh now I I'm definitely not going to try
18:52 - to recreate everything that Amazon does
18:54 - but I'm basically going to make it so
18:56 - that a user could come in here they
18:58 - could pick a category then so they could
19:02 - choose whether they want free or paid
19:03 - then choose a category and then choose
19:05 - whether they want audio or text and then
19:07 - search within that so you can filter
19:09 - down like to very small uh set of of
19:13 - things that you want um so that's that's
19:16 - how the filtering is going to work and
19:18 - then for the UI these cards are going to
19:21 - go away and it's going to look more like
19:22 - a list so I know there's like material
19:26 - design lists let me see
19:32 - let me see if I can show you an example
19:34 - of what it's going to look
19:36 - like or at least in my head what I think
19:39 - it's going to look like so I just did
19:41 - some sketches on paper during the
19:43 - meeting just so that I remembered uh but
19:47 - yeah it's basically going to look kind
19:49 - of have this list uh kind of look where
19:53 - I'm trying to find if there's a a better
19:57 - example down far there okay so this is I
20:00 - guess a decent example where it's going
20:03 - to be more like a list a one column list
20:06 - there'll be images on this side title uh
20:09 - the description will actually be hidden
20:11 - by default but you can click to read
20:13 - more so it'll enable them that to make
20:15 - really long descriptions if they want
20:18 - them uh and it won't mess up the flow of
20:21 - the page and cause a lot of scrolling uh
20:23 - so there'll be a little little arrow to
20:26 - drop down the description or hide the
20:27 - description
20:29 - um and then there'll be just some other
20:31 - basic information about each
20:33 - resource so that'll require a little bit
20:35 - on the WordPress end of things to add
20:37 - the custom fields for
20:39 - that um but then on the UI side of
20:42 - things it'll be you know we'll be
20:43 - changing that significantly uh probably
20:46 - making a new new react component for
20:49 - that uh so that's it those are the major
20:51 - changes that are going to happen uh
20:54 - there there are some other things that
20:55 - are going to happen but they're not it's
20:57 - not really worth talking about it's a
20:59 - lot of a lot more you know kind of minor
21:02 - things so today what I wanted to work on
21:05 - was doing all the changes that I talked
21:07 - about for this
21:10 - section
21:17 - so let me uh I'm just going to check the
21:19 - live chat
21:27 - quickly
21:28 - all right yeah uh philli was responding
21:30 - is uh someone had asked about why not
21:32 - just do it as a WordPress theme and
21:33 - Philip responded and said speed easier
21:35 - load balancing I think not using PHP
21:37 - yeah there's some there there are so
21:39 - many reasons there maybe isn't like one
21:42 - reason that's like for sure you should
21:44 - go this way but there were so many small
21:46 - reasons when you add them all up it made
21:48 - sense for me to do it like this uh and
21:51 - yeah not having to do a lot of PHP
21:53 - template things was a big plus for me
21:55 - because I'm not nothing there's nothing
21:57 - wrong with PHP that's just not where I
21:59 - want to go with my career and my
22:01 - learning path so I want to I want to go
22:04 - more with JavaScript and react and I
22:06 - think it'll be easier in the future
22:09 - given the growth of of react someone to
22:11 - maintain this site if I could just say
22:14 - hey this is just an HTML CSS JavaScript
22:17 - site basically with react someone could
22:20 - step right in if they had knowledge of
22:22 - JavaScript and probably pick up enough
22:23 - of react that they could do it I don't I
22:26 - don't need to say in a job description
22:29 - let's say for somebody who might replace
22:31 - me one day and say you have to know PHP
22:34 - all right I don't need that so anyway
22:36 - but there there's a lot of um a lot of
22:39 - reasons um not to say there's nothing
22:42 - wrong with WordPress um temp my own
22:44 - personal site is just a regular
22:46 - WordPress site with WordPress
22:49 - templates um Octavian says it's too
22:52 - boring to stay longer cheers to
22:55 - everybody see see you Octavian uh I'm
22:58 - sure Octavian is not here anymore but uh
23:01 - if if parts of the video are super
23:03 - boring to any of you let me know what
23:05 - parts are boring and then I will try to
23:07 - just cut those out uh I don't mind if if
23:10 - a part's really useful and boring that's
23:12 - okay but if it's boring and it's not
23:14 - useful to anybody then yeah I just want
23:17 - to cut it out so um yeah if anybody else
23:20 - thinks it's boring before you leave
23:21 - please let me know uh what exactly is
23:24 - the boring part um XDS which project is
23:28 - that it is it's the um uh the CI react
23:33 - oh yeah you so github.com
23:35 - Fus hyphen marcom slci react the link is
23:40 - in the description for the video this
23:42 - branch is called let me let me give you
23:46 - the branch name so you could it's called
23:49 - home hyphen alt so I'm working on that
23:52 - Branch right now if you want to check
23:54 - out any of the
23:56 - code
24:04 - all
24:05 - right okay Amed says the user interface
24:08 - design looks totally stunning to me uh
24:10 - awesome
24:12 - so uh thank you I'm I'm glad you think
24:15 - that uh yeah so I mean you all that have
24:19 - been watching for a while like we we
24:20 - worked really hard on this I really
24:21 - really appreciate you saying that
24:25 - um XD says would be cool would take it
24:28 - out of
24:30 - Wordpress yeah
24:32 - um I've thought about like totally not
24:34 - having WordPress involved at all but it
24:37 - just wasn't like going with a completely
24:40 - different content management system I
24:42 - the time frame that I had for this I
24:44 - just knew I wouldn't be able to do that
24:47 - uh in this time frame but if there is a
24:49 - A system that would be more lightweight
24:51 - and still as userfriendly as WordPress
24:54 - in terms of someone with no coding
24:56 - experience being able to come come in
24:57 - and input data then I'd definitely be
25:01 - open to that specifically I would love
25:03 - it if there was
25:05 - something that was well tested and
25:08 - reliable that could run uh off of node
25:12 - and then that way I could totally cut
25:14 - out the need for any PHP knowledge uh
25:17 - and it would just be uh JavaScript you
25:19 - know across the
25:23 - board uh ibuka asks uh just to confirm
25:28 - the site is built with nextjs yes it is
25:30 - it is built with
25:33 - nextjs
25:36 - um HED says nothing is boring Jesse
25:39 - you're doing great yeah honestly if
25:41 - someone's really Advanced at this my
25:43 - videos probably would be somewhat boring
25:45 - because I mean they'd already know all
25:47 - this so unless they're here to help me
25:49 - out it's you know it's going to be it's
25:52 - going to be pretty boring so anyway uh
25:55 - as long as people are still watching
25:57 - this and they still appreciate what I'm
25:59 - doing I'm still going to do it it do I
26:01 - mean if it's boring to some people
26:02 - that's fine there are like millions of
26:04 - videos out there that they could watch
26:06 - that may be less boring to them
26:11 - um okay uh XD says put some
26:15 - configuration instructions in the read
26:16 - me yeah I definitely should uh I've
26:19 - thought that before but it's just always
26:21 - been really low on the list um initially
26:24 - because I didn't think anybody would be
26:25 - working on it but now that you all are
26:27 - helping with it that that's going to
26:29 - move higher up on my list of things to
26:34 - do John John says LOL boring this is
26:39 - supposed to be your regular day as an
26:40 - expiring developer I want to know when
26:42 - it's boring valuable info besides I
26:45 - watch this while I codes so no problems
26:47 - okay
26:48 - cool yeah that is true I mean it is
26:50 - supposed to be my regular day and
26:52 - sometimes things are boring so uh I
26:56 - guess that's the point of the video then
26:57 - if my day is boring then the video ends
26:59 - up being boring I try to pick the uh
27:03 - most interesting thing of the day that I
27:05 - will be working on to record but there
27:09 - it's not always fun stuff all right so
27:11 - I'm going to go
27:14 - um philli says thumbs down for Drupal
27:17 - and jumla yeah I agree I've used them
27:20 - both before as well I I don't of Drupal
27:23 - jumla and
27:24 - WordPress WordPress to me by far is the
27:27 - easiest one to use um they actually the
27:31 - partner site to this so this is the site
27:34 - that's more like the marketing site and
27:36 - just informational and then there's
27:37 - going to be a learning management system
27:40 - that is actually built on Drupal that's
27:42 - not ready yet but it should be ready by
27:45 - the 15th of July and when it is then I'm
27:48 - going to link to it from there that site
27:50 - is built with Drupal uh the good thing
27:52 - is I guess because we're just basically
27:55 - pulling in everything through an API if
27:57 - I I needed to pull in data from the
27:58 - learning management system uh they could
28:01 - just expose all that data through an API
28:04 - and Drupal I guess and I could pull that
28:06 - data Ino and then I wouldn't actually
28:08 - have to develop anything for Drupal so
28:11 - uh but it's nobody uh they actually
28:13 - hired an outside company uh to do that
28:16 - so I'm not directly involved in any of
28:18 - that
28:21 - [Music]
28:25 - work all right so I'm I'm going to go
28:28 - I'm going to come back to the live chat
28:30 - but I want to work on um some of this uh
28:33 - this section first I don't think it's
28:35 - going to take a long time so I'll do
28:36 - some work for I don't know like 10 or 15
28:39 - minutes on this and I'll check back in
28:40 - with the live chat hopefully we can get
28:42 - this to a point where it's it looks it's
28:44 - decently you know kind of what we want
28:47 - and uh then I'll answer all your
28:48 - questions and everything in the live
28:50 - chat uh if you can't stick around till
28:52 - the end of the video to get your
28:53 - question answered please put it in the
28:55 - comments or direct message me on Twitter
28:57 - and then I will I will answer your
28:59 - question um whenever I get a chance
29:01 - within the next few days or so all right
29:03 - so first thing let's just work on so
29:08 - these are three different components
29:09 - actually so
29:12 - this I think it's three I think this is
29:14 - a nav component this is the hero section
29:17 - and then this is the sticky nav so we'll
29:19 - be working on all three of those
29:21 - components it is possible that I made
29:23 - this one component I can't even remember
29:26 - um when I did that but we'll find out
29:28 - here uh so this is the hero
29:33 - component and let me know if I need to
29:35 - blow this up even bigger I did preview
29:37 - the video and uh the quality was not
29:41 - great so I'm going to try to be as
29:43 - descriptive as I can you know as I'm
29:45 - talking about
29:47 - this so that you can if you can't see
29:49 - the code you can at
29:51 - least uh get an idea of what's going on
29:54 - there so yeah this hero section
30:00 - yeah so I think that is two
30:03 - separate
30:08 - components so we're
30:11 - doing we're going to drop the uh Tex
30:15 - size the font size of this
30:17 - so right now it's 100 pixels and let's
30:22 - drop this
30:25 - down this is drop it down to 75 for now
30:29 - and then I actually I want to increase
30:32 - the padding at the top a bit so I'll
30:34 - make this 175 instead of
30:37 - 150
30:40 - and what because what I want to do okay
30:43 - great that will allow me to move this
30:46 - make this bigger and this bigger that
30:48 - should move down a bit and then this
30:50 - will look that that's a decent a decent
30:54 - size we'll move this up a bit yeah I
30:57 - like that that that should work for now
31:00 - sometimes it just works out well you
31:01 - just guess and it it looks all
31:03 - right
31:05 - um let's
31:07 - [Music]
31:08 - see
31:11 - margin I could do this in Dev tools too
31:13 - but these these adjustments are pretty
31:15 - straightforward
31:18 - so uh what I want to make the margin
31:25 - 83 let's move it up let's try to make
31:31 - it
31:36 - 100 there we go yeah moved it up a bit I
31:40 - actually I think I want it up even
31:44 - more I want to see how much I can get
31:47 - this up
31:48 - here without it okay that's that's much
31:52 - better there uh it's it's a little bit
31:55 - too much right now but we're going to
31:56 - shrink this a bit too so I think this
31:58 - will work uh by moving this up so we've
32:03 - actually shrunk this section Now by over
32:05 - a 100 pixels and it still
32:08 - looks you know pretty close to what it
32:11 - was before uh so looking at it now
32:14 - though we probably need to bump this
32:17 - down a bit more if we're going to make
32:20 - this bigger so let's just let's do that
32:23 - we're going to bump this down a bit more
32:24 - and we're going to shrink this and then
32:26 - then I'm to move on to some of these
32:28 - other components I think that's uh
32:31 - that's a good
32:33 - start
32:37 - so yeah let me move this make the
32:40 - padding for this
32:43 - one 200
32:47 - and if I'm going to go over this real
32:50 - quickly in case someone's not familiar
32:51 - with react and what's going on here um
32:55 - so this is a react component
32:57 - and then within this component we have
32:59 - what looks like basic
33:02 - HTML um and this is just a JavaScript
33:06 - class okay so react is is mostly just
33:08 - regular JavaScript with a little bit of
33:12 - um this this jsx is what lets us make
33:16 - the uh have the HTML kind of mixed in
33:18 - with the JavaScript and it works and
33:20 - that I mean that's just like syntactic
33:21 - sugar but really what's going on here is
33:24 - all just it's all just functions and
33:26 - classes and things it's basic JavaScript
33:28 - stuff
33:31 - so when we want to add a style to
33:34 - something we we actually put in a
33:37 - JavaScript object and that's how we can
33:39 - put inline
33:40 - CSS uh into our our jsx which is what
33:44 - this is called this this kind of mix of
33:46 - HTML and JavaScript okay so this works
33:49 - like normal um normally you do have to
33:51 - put class name uh there's an mpm module
33:54 - now installed where I don't have to use
33:56 - class name I can use class but if you're
33:57 - just working on react like for the first
33:59 - time and it's just straight up react you
34:02 - have to put class name instead of class
34:05 - okay so anything that's a reserved uh
34:07 - word in JavaScript you can't use so
34:10 - class name is one uh instead of using
34:13 - four you have to use HTML 4 those two I
34:15 - know there's probably other ones but uh
34:18 - for sure those two you have to change
34:21 - but otherwise you just make an object so
34:24 - the first
34:25 - bracket tells
34:28 - um basically the compiler that's going
34:30 - to change the jsx
34:31 - into something that browsers can handle
34:34 - it just tells it like Hey we're going to
34:36 - do some JavaScript now and then the
34:38 - second bracket is our object and then we
34:40 - put in the
34:42 - CSS uh and then we make it camel case
34:45 - instead of hyphenated like normal CSS uh
34:48 - and then you know we just add in uh
34:51 - whatever we want uh our values to be
34:54 - here and these are in uh uh you know in
34:58 - quotation marks and then we just close
35:00 - out our object and we close out our
35:02 - JavaScript and now we're right back into
35:04 - the HTML
35:06 - style uh if you want to do more than one
35:08 - since it's a JavaScript object you just
35:10 - put a comma and then you keep on going
35:12 - and you make more okay you could put a
35:13 - bunch of CSS okay now that's one way to
35:16 - do it there's another way and this is
35:18 - styled uh jsx I don't think this comes
35:23 - with react I think this comes builtin
35:25 - with next so
35:27 - if you're using nextjs this will work if
35:30 - you're using just plain react I'm I
35:32 - can't guarantee that this will work but
35:35 - you use a style tag but then you just
35:37 - add jsx in here you drop into JavaScript
35:42 - right with our bracket and then we put a
35:43 - template
35:44 - literal uh we we start a template
35:47 - literal this is a es6 thing um a
35:50 - template literal syntax uh it lets you
35:53 - basically make a string in JavaScript
35:55 - and then you can um
35:57 - put in JavaScript within that string and
35:59 - you can also have your string take up
36:02 - multiple lines and it still works uh so
36:05 - very very handy but within that then you
36:07 - just do regular CSS I mean all this CSS
36:10 - is exactly how you would do it in a
36:12 - normal CSS file then you just close out
36:15 - the template literal with your little
36:17 - back tick and I there's no way you all
36:19 - can probably see that back tick on the
36:21 - screen so sorry about that I'll try to
36:23 - make it a bit bigger um and then you
36:26 - close out
36:28 - your uh JavaScript with another bracket
36:31 - okay and that's how you do CSS in a
36:34 - react component these aren't the only
36:35 - ways there are a lot of other uh like
36:39 - modules like npm modules and things out
36:41 - there that you can download to help you
36:43 - do CSS in in your react component these
36:47 - are the ways that I've used and that I'm
36:49 - working with now I've seen like talks on
36:51 - a lot of other different ways so there
36:53 - may be better ways out
36:55 - there um
36:57 - I'm going to
36:58 - look that was a big explanation so I'm
37:01 - just going to check really quick in the
37:02 - chat to see if I lost anybody if had any
37:05 - anyone had any questions I don't want to
37:07 - lose especially the people that are
37:08 - really new to react uh I want to make
37:10 - sure that I can help you um kind of know
37:13 - what's going on as much as I
37:18 - can okay I'm not
37:21 - seeing looks
37:24 - like it looks like there's not any
37:27 - questions specifically about this in the
37:30 - live chat right now so I'm going to move
37:32 - on okay so next thing is we want to make
37:35 - this a bit smaller so I do have
37:42 - um let's see for the hero
37:45 - section I have a minimum height
37:51 - set of
37:52 - 80 uh I yeah I think I can drop that
37:55 - down I don't think I wanted to take up
37:57 - that much now uh we'll drop that down to
37:59 - 60 but then we're also going to drop our
38:02 - background size down to 60 to match
38:06 - that uh we may have to change the
38:08 - positioning here we'll see uh also the
38:11 - margin we'll just we'll see how that how
38:13 - that works
38:16 - out whoa okay I don't think I want
38:20 - it I don't know that I want it that
38:22 - small I'm not sure what do you what do
38:24 - you all think uh in this case I do have
38:28 - some some discretion here we didn't
38:30 - decide on exactly how small this section
38:32 - would get
38:35 - so I wasn't planning on it being this
38:37 - small but now that I see
38:40 - it I think it could be I mean obviously
38:43 - we'll have to position this differently
38:46 - and Shrink this up a bit too
38:51 - but I think it could be this one and
38:54 - work let me know what you think
38:59 - uh I'm I'm for now I think I'm going to
39:01 - move this over a little bit and I'm
39:03 - going to shrink this text up a bit and
39:05 - just see how it looks sorry if you hear
39:07 - anything in the background those are
39:09 - probably my kids and my wife shushing
39:11 - them so sorry about that but in case you
39:15 - missed the beginning I am working from
39:16 - home
39:17 - today also let me know uh how the the
39:21 - video quality is I expect it to not be
39:23 - that good and I'm sorry about that uh
39:25 - but let me know if it's like totally ter
39:28 - completely terrible like not worth
39:30 - continuing the video or anything like
39:32 - that I don't really think I can do
39:34 - anything about it I've set the settings
39:37 - you know pretty low if I do go any lower
39:40 - the video is going to be
39:43 - like really low quality it I just don't
39:46 - it the screen won't be the text won't be
39:48 - readable at that point at
39:50 - all um so let's I'm actually going to go
39:54 - into Dev tools for this because this is
39:56 - going to
39:57 - be I'm going to want to mess with these
40:00 - positions a
40:02 - bit so let me bring
40:09 - over move this over I don't know if it's
40:11 - worth it for me to bring over Dev tools
40:14 - uh
40:15 - because I don't know that I can zoom in
40:17 - enough for it even to be
40:25 - readable and I actually I do have I have
40:28 - media queries and stuff going on here
40:30 - too so let's let's make this bigger
40:34 - first uh because I I want to we're going
40:37 - to have to shrink it down and then just
40:39 - hit several media
40:41 - queries several break
40:44 - points so right now all I'm changing is
40:47 - that background position X so I'm just
40:51 - hitting the down arrow key on my
40:53 - keyboard to change that background
40:55 - position and
40:57 - and I'm wondering like do I shrink this
41:02 - so that the whole thing fits or do I
41:05 - just leave it so that it's really big
41:07 - like this and and partially
41:10 - blocked I don't really I don't know the
41:12 - answer to that right now I'm I'm
41:17 - wondering maybe I can we'll shrink it a
41:20 - [Music]
41:22 - bit I think like the largess of it has a
41:25 - good impact even cuz even if it's off
41:28 - the screen you can't see it it still
41:31 - appears like it's large you know that
41:32 - part of it's obscured but you can still
41:34 - get like this this size um so I kind of
41:39 - like
41:44 - that I don't know that that looks okay
41:47 - for now oh um I'm going to copy over
41:50 - what I did now and then that way you
41:52 - you'll be able to see it so in depth in
41:56 - Chrome Dev
41:58 - tools I made some of these
42:01 - adjustments and so basically we just
42:03 - dropped down the the X position the Y
42:05 - position and then I change the
42:08 - background size from 60 to
42:14 - 49 and this is 49 viewport width so the
42:19 - the size of the background is actually
42:23 - dependent on the width of the screen so
42:25 - it's it's kind of gives it uh
42:28 - responsiveness uh so it scales nicely so
42:32 - you can see like it's obviously smaller
42:34 - at this point now we're also hitting
42:35 - some media queries so that's that's
42:38 - potentially changing the size but I
42:40 - don't think right there yeah that break
42:42 - Point's not changing the size it's just
42:46 - changing the
42:50 - positioning all right see so we do have
42:52 - some really weird stuff happening at
42:54 - some points now
42:57 - that we'll need to work out now I don't
42:59 - know that it will work all that out on
43:01 - this
43:07 - video but just basically and uh at this
43:10 - point we've hit another breakpoint so I
43:13 - want to change it because that's
43:14 - obviously not working I don't want it to
43:17 - be up that
43:25 - high
43:30 - so goodness that's yeah that starts to
43:34 - look terrible when you get down lower we
43:36 - have to figure something out uh but
43:38 - that's okay so I'm going to
43:40 - change this break point so this 1200
43:44 - pixel
43:46 - breako instead of
43:48 - 26% for the uh background position y I'm
43:53 - going to change that to negative
43:57 - 32%
44:07 - oops and an easy fix that we might do so
44:13 - this component actually doesn't display
44:14 - at all once we get small enough
44:18 - screen
44:25 - so we could instead of trying to mess
44:28 - with all of this we could
44:31 - just make it go away I mean this is
44:34 - depending
44:35 - on on how it
44:39 - looks I think it does make sense that
44:42 - probably at the point where the logo
44:45 - gets
44:47 - centered at that point this hero section
44:50 - should go
44:54 - away and so that's
44:56 - 900 900 or
45:01 - so looks like
45:05 - 992 so we'll set
45:09 - this
45:12 - 992 and this this media uh query
45:15 - controls when that is displayed right so
45:18 - I didn't
45:19 - want for users with small screens
45:22 - they're most likely on a mobile
45:24 - device
45:27 - so when this I didn't want them to one
45:30 - have to load a large image here and have
45:32 - a huge section to have to scroll down uh
45:36 - down that section so let's
45:40 - see all right that works we also have to
45:44 - adjust our media query now for the nav
45:46 - component to make it display at that
45:49 - that
45:51 - range all right I'm going to check the
45:54 - live chat again just really quickly
46:01 - okay Ahmed says uh aled probably already
46:04 - left so I don't know if he'll hear this
46:06 - or not but he said he's got to go
46:08 - because the time in India is 12:43 a.m.
46:11 - so got to get some sleep totally
46:13 - understand that uh so I'll see you um
46:16 - hopefully next week I can get some
46:17 - streams in uh at a decent quality from
46:20 - my office uh thanks for watching
46:24 - ahed
46:27 - let's
46:32 - see all right looks like there's some
46:34 - good conversation going on in the live
46:35 - chat but it doesn't look like a lot is
46:37 - directed at me in terms of questions
46:40 - so oh okay it looks like uh XD said the
46:43 - resolution is is cool it's
46:47 - so
46:48 - cool Umberto says uh Umberto likes how
46:52 - it looks partially blocked so so this
46:55 - monit so maybe maybe we will uh increase
46:57 - the size and just let it be a little bit
46:58 - blocked I'm I'm with you there I think
47:01 - it you still get the sense that it's
47:04 - large even though you can't see all of
47:05 - it and since it's I mean it's basically
47:07 - a symmetrical thing so you can you can
47:09 - get even if you've never seen this is
47:11 - called a monstr even if you've never
47:13 - seen one
47:14 - before you can basically guess that it's
47:16 - going to continue to be a
47:18 - circle um I mean I don't I have seen one
47:21 - before and I've seen this whole image
47:23 - but it seems to me like the shape of it
47:27 - you know suggests basically that it
47:29 - keeps going around anyway
47:33 - so I'll work on that a
47:39 - bit uh Sean ask as what I was creating
47:43 - because just came on uh basically I'm
47:46 - I'm editing this this section used to be
47:48 - really big like a big hero section and
47:50 - we're shrinking it down uh to make it
47:52 - much shorter and so we need to make a
47:55 - lot of a adjustments here with the size
47:56 - of the image and the font size and you
47:59 - know how they're they're um displayed um
48:03 - their
48:10 - positioning uh Alberto says uh are you
48:13 - not using the hide on materialized
48:15 - classes yeah
48:18 - so uh if you've if you've been watching
48:20 - or you might have noticed in the code
48:22 - I'm using materialize as my framework
48:25 - for my
48:27 - Styles and there are already classes to
48:30 - hide and show things and
48:31 - materialize I didn't use those classes
48:34 - before
48:37 - because
48:39 - um I I had like custom break points that
48:42 - I wanted to use they didn't match up
48:44 - with the break points that were already
48:45 - built in although at this point I
48:49 - probably could switch to those because I
48:52 - think our break points are actually
48:54 - starting to align
48:56 - so originally the break points weren't
48:59 - lined up but now I think like this break
49:01 - point here does match up with the
49:05 - materialized break points
49:09 - so that's probably a good idea what
49:11 - would that be hide on I think that would
49:13 - be hide on medium and down let's do that
49:17 - that's certainly like a much cleaner way
49:19 - to do it so I'm going to try this so
49:22 - instead of having our showing and hiding
49:26 - this in some CSS that we've written
49:29 - we're going to try to use the
49:30 - class hide on medium and down so I think
49:36 - that's how it
49:38 - goes if it doesn't work at all then I'll
49:40 - look it up but I'm pretty sure that's
49:43 - the uh the way you write it and then
49:47 - let's take out so we won't need this
49:51 - actually we we'll probably I'll leave
49:53 - this Max height thing in
49:58 - because they don't have a a
50:02 - height uh class built in all right so
50:06 - let me save that and this should still
50:14 - hide
50:16 - whoops oh did I start the video
50:19 - accidentally started the video I keep
50:20 - doing that all the time I might just
50:22 - take the video out while I'm working so
50:23 - I quit accidentally starting it all
50:27 - right so it should disappear nice it did
50:29 - Umberto awesome suggestion so now we're
50:32 - not going to worry about doing our break
50:35 - points manually uh we're going to use
50:38 - the uh now that our break points are
50:41 - actually lining up with the built-in
50:43 - once we materialized we can just use
50:45 - those
50:46 - classes uh so that's cool let
50:50 - me let's
50:54 - see
50:55 - I'm going to check the live chat really
50:57 - quick some
51:00 - questions um Isaiah asked how are you
51:04 - structuring your code I think in CSS
51:06 - it's easy to have unorganized code yeah
51:07 - for sure it is in my CSS right now is so
51:10 - if you look if you check out the repo
51:13 - and look at my style.css file it's a
51:15 - mess it's really like the reason that
51:19 - it's a mess there's two reasons why it's
51:21 - why it's a mess so all this was
51:23 - originally built in with SAS and then
51:25 - just converted over to CSS so this isn't
51:29 - really how I wrote it you know this is
51:31 - the converted version so it's a little
51:33 - bit messed up because of that the other
51:35 - reason is uh I had intended most of this
51:39 - to actually live in the components so I
51:41 - didn't bother trying to organize it that
51:43 - much because I always figured well I'm
51:45 - just going to move this over into all
51:46 - the components at some point anyway I
51:48 - have slowly been moving things over but
51:52 - I haven't obviously I have not moved
51:54 - everything over
51:56 - so uh at some point I'd like to move it
51:59 - into the components but it's just not
52:01 - happening yet actually if anybody um if
52:05 - you really want to get
52:09 - some
52:10 - um I don't know like some pool requests
52:14 - accepted on GitHub just to like build up
52:15 - your portfolio maybe you're like uh want
52:19 - to want it to look a little bit more
52:20 - impressive for a job or something feel
52:22 - free to take that on to even if it's you
52:25 - just want to move a little bit over and
52:27 - that's cool as long as everything still
52:28 - works I'll definitely accept that pull
52:30 - request uh otherwise I might have saved
52:32 - some of this I have a student worker
52:34 - right now and I'm hopefully going to
52:36 - have some more student workers from the
52:38 - computer science department this might
52:40 - be a really good thing to just start
52:42 - them out with so that they get used to
52:46 - you know submitting pool requests and
52:48 - just some basic stuff uh cuz they're
52:50 - really knowledgeable about a lot of
52:53 - computer science things but not really
52:55 - about web development
52:58 - so kind of they need to be brought in
53:01 - with like little Little
53:03 - Steps so anyway I fully acknowledge that
53:07 - my CSS is a mess right now and I
53:09 - acknowledge that that is not
53:15 - ideal um XTS do you have media queries
53:18 - for all sizes
53:20 - um not really I
53:23 - don't I don't know I'd have to look I
53:25 - didn't I don't think I'm using that many
53:26 - media queries but maybe I
53:29 - am uh as I was doing this I was trying
53:31 - to go really fast uh like before launch
53:34 - so I think I did get sloppy with my
53:36 - media queries at some point so I
53:39 - probably do have a lot of them more than
53:41 - I
53:42 - need
53:44 - um XD ask about CSS pre-processors yes
53:48 - so I did use SAS but I'm not right
53:51 - now uh Patrick says the um the white bar
53:56 - at the top he's asking about the white
53:58 - bar so basically what happened is with
54:00 - that white bar is so like you can see
54:03 - here you can kind of see the nav here I
54:05 - have to adjust some stuff so this
54:06 - actually shows up but the nav's there
54:09 - and then it disappears because I have a
54:11 - media query to hide it at this point I
54:15 - just need to adjust it so when I
54:18 - adjusted the media query for this
54:23 - section it made it disappear here so
54:25 - there's this like basically from this
54:28 - wide to this wide there's this space now
54:30 - where there's nothing here so I just
54:32 - need to make the the thinner version of
54:35 - the nav appear there so when I go over
54:39 - it to edit we're about I'm about to edit
54:41 - that component now so I'll uh change
54:44 - that in a second and then that'll work
54:47 - um XD says you can you can split it man
54:49 - are you talking about my
54:50 - CSS yeah uh and use one style sheet for
54:54 - component yeah yeah that was my that was
54:57 - my plan that was my plan to do it so
55:00 - originally this site was actually just a
55:02 - static HTML site it was not react and
55:05 - that's where the majority of the styles
55:07 - were made in SAS for that site so that's
55:10 - why it was just one
55:12 - stylesheet like I said the idea was to
55:15 - split it up when it became a react site
55:18 - it just
55:19 - had it just hasn't happened as fast as I
55:22 - uh as I wanted
55:23 - to um
55:27 - let's
55:35 - see okay so XD sent said uh a PR send a
55:40 - PR trying to change it uh all that stuff
55:43 - thank you I appreciate that I'll check
55:44 - that out after the
55:46 - video yeah okay so Joshua says you need
55:49 - to add the SAS loader to your webpack
55:51 - config yes so
55:55 - when I first started working with nextjs
55:58 - that wasn't you couldn't do custom
56:01 - configs for webpack so this was like I
56:05 - don't know we're like almost on version
56:07 - three for next something like that this
56:09 - was like way back like pre version two
56:11 - you couldn't do that so when I started
56:14 - this project I would just assume that I
56:17 - couldn't do it and then after IID
56:19 - started it I realized that you could now
56:21 - do custom webpack configs but at that
56:24 - point point I had
56:26 - already like I was already in the middle
56:28 - of it and I thought you know what I
56:29 - don't I don't even care at this point
56:30 - I'm just going to keep going with it but
56:32 - yeah you you can add the assass loader
56:36 - in um and next let you do that now and
56:40 - uh so it's definitely possible and it
56:42 - would be
56:46 - better let's see yeah so xd's laughing
56:51 - at me in the live chat here because I
56:52 - have one file for all the Styles yeah
56:55 - um I mean there are actually a lot of
56:57 - styles within the components now too
57:00 - so technically I have many files but I
57:03 - only have one CSS
57:06 - file uh all right so the only thing I
57:10 - think I really need to do now before I
57:12 - move on to the nav component is make
57:15 - sure that this text doesn't overlap the
57:17 - logo
57:19 - and I just need to make this text a lot
57:22 - smaller so I'm going to have
57:25 - go into Dev tools
57:26 - [Music]
57:28 - on my other screen here and then at
57:31 - least you can
57:34 - see
57:38 - H yeah I don't it needs to be I think
57:42 - like at least that
57:44 - big it just looks way too small
57:47 - otherwise
57:51 - so all right let's go with that and
57:57 - move it down a
58:01 - bit I tell you the truth I'm I don't
58:03 - really like how that looks right
58:06 - now I think that looks
58:11 - bad yeah I mean look that's that looks
58:18 - terrible I don't know what do you think
58:20 - I think that looks really
58:23 - bad
58:27 - uh Joshua asked about nextjs said it you
58:30 - made it sound similar to create react
58:32 - react create app uh yeah it is it's
58:34 - basically does the same thing as that it
58:36 - just adds some other things like
58:39 - um uh mainly the biggest reason I use
58:42 - next instead of uh the create react app
58:48 - is server side
58:50 - rendering because that comes built in
58:52 - with
58:53 - next also the routing is helpful I I've
58:57 - learned how to do routing with react
58:58 - router since then but at first I didn't
59:01 - I wasn't that great with routing and
59:03 - react so the fact that next had built-in
59:06 - routing was also a big plus all right
59:09 - so I we need to do something with this
59:12 - I'm going to bring up I'm going to bring
59:15 - up the live site as a
59:21 - reference yeah something needs to happen
59:23 - because this looks really balance
59:26 - now
59:35 - so I think we
59:38 - need maybe this needs to come over a bit
59:42 - maybe be bigger there's just so much
59:45 - space and I'm wondering
59:48 - why why is this on three lines maybe I
59:53 - um
60:00 - okay so if you can see on the screen I
60:02 - have it in this
60:11 - container so that's part of the problem
60:14 - is that the container that it's in is
60:16 - making it that
60:17 - small we might be able to get away we'll
60:21 - see let me know what you think about
60:22 - this but we could probably get away with
60:24 - making this even
60:26 - shorter and then having this line just
60:30 - be like a line across the bottom
60:36 - here I'm not sure I kind of I kind of
60:39 - want to see how it would
60:41 - look I'm not 100% convinced that that
60:44 - would be the right way to do
60:48 - it but I think it's worth a
60:53 - shot
60:56 - so to make that happen I'm probably
60:58 - going to have to change a little bit of
61:00 - the
61:01 - HTML I mean I can I can just mess with
61:04 - it here
61:05 - but if I really wanted it to work I'll
61:08 - have to change the structure a
61:23 - bit
61:26 - yeah so let me I was trying to just
61:28 - change it in Dev tools but there's too
61:30 - much too much that needs change so you
61:32 - can see how I have this now is I
61:34 - actually have it uh inside like a column
61:37 - class so um so we have it in a row and
61:42 - then in a column and we need to separate
61:44 - that out so you can see like this is the
61:47 - column which I've I've messed around
61:49 - with in Dev tools and then the row but
61:52 - the row is really restricting it
61:55 - down to this side so I can't go over so
61:58 - we need to completely just take it out
61:59 - of the row uh so we can position it
62:03 - however we
62:06 - want
62:09 - so I do want to
62:12 - keep basically I just need to keep this
62:15 - H1 so let's take that out and then
62:19 - everything within this
62:21 - row we get rid of
62:27 - and we'll just pop this in here oh man
62:31 - wow
62:33 - that that's
62:35 - terrible I mean we are whenever we save
62:39 - a commit it'll reformat this anyway but
62:41 - so I guess it's not a big deal also we
62:45 - had
62:47 - the I'll see if this works we might have
62:49 - to the text might revert to being
62:53 - black yeah yeah it looks like it did so
62:56 - let me add the
63:05 - class white
63:11 - text there we go okay so now we have it
63:15 - to the point where we can at least
63:19 - see the only problem with doing it this
63:22 - way is like at some point
63:26 - we're going to have to make even further
63:28 - adjustments right
63:30 - because it's just too big I mean maybe
63:33 - we could decrease the font size a bit so
63:35 - that we wouldn't have to worry so that
63:37 - would like it would never hit I mean
63:39 - we're close right now I just never want
63:42 - there to be an overlap uh over top of
63:46 - this image
63:47 - so need some
63:53 - adjustment
64:00 - at this point I'm thinking like I
64:02 - probably could have just completely
64:03 - redone this this whole section and not
64:05 - just tried to adjust
64:07 - it uh
64:09 - but let's at least you know do a do a
64:13 - little bit of adjustment here just to
64:14 - get a good visual of what what it could
64:18 - be
64:20 - and let's
64:23 - make
64:25 - make this
64:41 - shorter all right that's good for
64:44 - now
64:46 - and let's move this
64:53 - down
65:11 - okay and I definitely want to move this
65:20 - over okay um all right so that give us
65:24 - like a rough idea of where this
65:26 - potentially could
65:29 - be
65:31 - so I'm GNA just look at this for a
65:35 - second you all can check it out as
65:38 - well let me know what you think I mean
65:41 - basically we're going from from
65:45 - this let's break them out so we can see
65:47 - the side by
65:50 - side and we've kind of made it really I
65:54 - guess
65:57 - extreme change
66:00 - here you know
66:06 - originally so originally I wasn't
66:08 - thinking it would be that
66:17 - extreme all right so uh the delay on the
66:20 - video should be up so hopefully I'll be
66:22 - getting some feed
66:26 - feedback okay feedback is is it is kind
66:30 - of weird
66:36 - um okay so I'm going back now on the
66:40 - live chat and checking out some of the
66:51 - feedback okay so Matt says can make the
66:55 - the logo in the upper left larger and uh
66:58 - vertically Center it okay
67:03 - um Philip asks is that an image or text
67:05 - in the center um if you're talking about
67:08 - this this is actually text so You' asked
67:11 - that a while ago so
67:15 - maybe maybe you figured that
67:19 - out there we go okay so Justin had said
67:22 - you could make it make it one
67:27 - line okay Matt agrees on line would be
67:33 - better Matt also says I have to admit I
67:35 - don't like the react inline Styles I'm
67:37 - so excited to move from inline styling
67:40 - to CSS I can't believe we're moving back
67:42 - to inline and popularity yeah I know it
67:45 - is really weird it was really weird when
67:46 - I saw it at first too because that's how
67:49 - I don't know I mean I had everything
67:51 - always said like don't use inline CS
67:54 - but um the I I've I'm on board with it
67:59 - now because of the con just being having
68:02 - everything being modular and reusable
68:04 - like
68:05 - be if I can make my components so
68:08 - self-contained to the point where I
68:10 - could just pull one component off of one
68:12 - project and pop it into another project
68:14 - and it would look the same and behave
68:16 - the same that is super valuable uh so I
68:21 - really like that that aspect of it
68:24 - especially if I could just with a few
68:26 - things adjust the styles to match like a
68:30 - new color scheme but basically
68:31 - everything else would be able to stay
68:33 - the same I think that's valuable and for
68:37 - me at least that helped me to get over
68:40 - the weirdness of it of putting the
68:42 - Styles you know in
68:48 - line okay Matt says the the logo in the
68:51 - upper left needs to have size increased
68:53 - to match the other two elements in the
68:54 - scope it barely registers on the screen
68:56 - with the other elements that's exactly
68:58 - what everyone was saying in the meeting
69:00 - yesterday so that was the the whole
69:02 - point of decreasing this stuff was so
69:04 - that this didn't get lost so yeah you're
69:08 - you're right on target that's what that
69:11 - was the General consensus
69:13 - yesterday John says if you use flex
69:16 - Direction column div inside your header
69:18 - within a flex div row you would have
69:20 - much more responsive control without
69:22 - playing with the margins Etc also the
69:26 - remm font size can tie well to
69:28 - responsive width okay I
69:32 - will now when when I am using the flex
69:35 - stuff
69:37 - though uh how back this support go for
69:41 - that I am using Flex in some other areas
69:42 - of site so I'm not super concerned about
69:45 - the support for it uh but I do I have
69:48 - noticed that like
69:50 - i1 just when I use flex with i1 it
69:54 - doesn't it doesn't look right
69:58 - so I don't know is anyone has experience
70:01 - with that I mean I'm not super worried
70:03 - about it there's not that many people
70:05 - that that even view the site with ie11
70:09 - but if I if it's not too difficult to
70:13 - support it I would like to support
70:15 - it so let's
70:19 - work let me let me just see if I can
70:21 - make this bigger since we've had a few
70:23 - suggestions about making this bigger uh
70:25 - I just want to
70:28 - see what it would look
70:34 - like so let's make this a bit bigger oh
70:38 - actually yeah that doesn't look bad at
70:39 - all I don't know
70:41 - what what size that
70:44 - is uh originally but it looks
70:48 - good oh yeah it's definitely big enough
70:51 - we can make that bigger
70:54 - um
70:58 - [Music]
71:04 - awesome oh okay so uh i11 does have 98%
71:09 - support that's
71:12 - cool and that was uh John John just
71:15 - informed me about that XD saying you can
71:17 - use webkit
71:19 - prefixes okay cool yeah the the main
71:22 - thing that I've noticed breaks in i1 is
71:25 - uh when I try to vertically align things
71:28 - with
71:32 - flexbox maybe that's like the one thing
71:34 - that's not
71:36 - supported but yeah actually that that
71:41 - logo looks a lot better uh when it's
71:44 - bigger like that so I'm I'm going to
71:46 - bring that over and currently this the
71:49 - styles for that logo currently live in
71:52 - the style.css so this is going to be an
71:54 - instance where we
71:56 - can move that into the component so this
71:59 - is going to be in the nav
72:02 - component
72:05 - and let's find it's the brand
72:09 - logo
72:11 - so we can put
72:20 - it oops no I don't want to class I want
72:22 - to
72:24 - I want an inline
72:38 - style
72:40 - um and then I definitely want to remove
72:43 - this in the CSS so assuming that this
72:45 - does look all
72:48 - right and let me
72:50 - move I'm GNA get rid of this we don't
72:52 - need that right now
72:56 - dang
72:58 - it I keep clicking this accidentally
73:03 - um yeah that looks good let me
73:09 - do okay
73:11 - I I think that that looks all right so
73:14 - let's go to um we'll take a little chunk
73:17 - out of this giant unorganized CSS file
73:21 - here so
73:24 - it feels really good every time I get to
73:25 - delete something out of this
73:38 - file so line
73:40 - 208 oh man we
73:47 - got I forgot I had some media queries
73:50 - associated with it as
73:52 - well
73:56 - all right so I will have to include
73:58 - these so let's grab
74:05 - this wow I got a lot of
74:13 - stuff I while we're
74:15 - here why don't I just grab all the nav
74:22 - stuff and then I can just get rid of it
74:25 - from this
74:29 - file I didn't even realize I had this
74:34 - much all right
74:43 - so now the the formatting is insane
74:49 - like like I said this not usually how I
74:52 - format CSS this was just the auto uh
74:55 - formatting oops going to move it to our
74:58 - component so you have the nav component
75:01 - here uh I'll leave that here just for
75:03 - now but I am going to take that out and
75:05 - down
75:08 - below it looks like I had already
75:10 - transferred some stuff over here so we
75:12 - may have to clean it
75:20 - up uh I want in case I've done something
75:23 - here that I was overriding I'm going to
75:26 - put all the new styles on top so that
75:29 - when it Cascades
75:31 - um it should still all work and then I
75:34 - can always clean that up if there's any
75:37 - duplicates
75:40 - so the only thing that I need to change
75:43 - right now is this
75:50 - height nope not that height
75:54 - the uh logo
76:03 - height so brand logo image height needs
76:07 - to be
76:11 - 130 and now I can remove this the reason
76:14 - I didn't want to keep this here is
76:16 - because this would overwrite everything
76:17 - in the media queries and I need that
76:21 - so I'm going to save
76:23 - that I guess I could check quickly to
76:26 - make
76:27 - sure all right well that's nothing
76:30 - nothing change
76:32 - significantly
76:34 - so that's
76:36 - cool that
76:37 - works uh
76:40 - now let's remove all this stuff from the
76:44 - style styles.
76:52 - CSS
76:56 - oh yes that felt so good to get rid of
76:59 - that so so see I'm cutting down on it
77:03 - here all right I'm going to check back
77:06 - in the live chat
77:12 - quickly okay uh John said that uh his
77:16 - most recent site is all flex and with
77:19 - ie1 it's good so maybe um
77:29 - maybe the maybe I need to just go back
77:31 - and make sure that I do have the correct
77:34 - uh vendor prefixes and
77:37 - things says it looks looks so
77:39 - complicated yeah it I know it
77:45 - does um I feel like every time I go back
77:48 - to this file someone else uh comments
77:51 - about how how messy it is but it is it's
77:54 - true it is really messy it was never
77:56 - supposed to be like that
77:59 - um sometimes you just have to do things
78:01 - to get a site
78:03 - launched and then you clean it up
78:05 - later um that was the case in case you
78:09 - haven't seen like the whole thing and
78:11 - the story of this site quick recap is
78:14 - this was a totally unexpected project
78:17 - that I got assigned to like one day I
78:20 - was working on something and all of a
78:23 - sudden it was like drop everything do
78:25 - this project and the completion date was
78:28 - like it was just a really really tight
78:30 - deadline and um
78:33 - so a lot a lot of the
78:36 - stuff some of the stuff that's not
78:39 - really a great practice in the code is
78:41 - entire it's entirely possible that it's
78:43 - just because of my lack of of knowledge
78:46 - of the right way to do it but some of
78:48 - the stuff CSS included was simply
78:51 - because I just it just needed to get
78:54 - done
78:56 - so it was like you know what I I need
78:59 - this done like I'm just going to type it
79:01 - out and I'll have time later so there
79:04 - were a lot of points where it was like
79:05 - I'll have time later to clean this up
79:08 - and now is really that later so um so
79:12 - that's why I'm doing it
79:14 - now although I do appreciate everybody
79:17 - saying that I should clean it up so I'm
79:19 - not I'm not mad about it but I'm I'm
79:21 - just saying I I agree you don't have to
79:24 - convince me that it should be cleaned up
79:27 - um all right so what else did we want to
79:32 - change in
79:33 - here not
79:35 - hero um we wanted to make
79:39 - that The
79:42 - Branding
79:44 - text bigger where where is
79:49 - that I think it's here okay yeah it's
79:52 - here here uh
79:55 - so if you're not sure this outlink this
79:58 - is uh from a few um a few streams ago uh
80:03 - we made a component uh
80:07 - that basically fixed a bug in react GA
80:12 - that let us do click tracking with
80:14 - outbound links and open them up in a new
80:16 - tab so that's why this is the outlink
80:18 - component uh so you can check out that
80:21 - that video and um and the code for that
80:24 - if if you're interested but that's why
80:26 - it's not just your know a regular link
80:29 - tag uh so for
80:32 - this I think
80:35 - I we'll just do this in Dev tools first
80:38 - just to get an idea of what it's going
80:39 - to look
80:43 - like do I not
80:45 - have I actually don't think I even have
80:47 - a font size set for this this is just
80:49 - the default font
80:51 - size
81:02 - interesting all right so let's
81:07 - see this is up
81:09 - from it's just a a bit
81:13 - bigger
81:15 - 18 it's 18
81:17 - pixels let's try to go
81:20 - 20 20 doesn't look too bad I do think it
81:23 - needs a bit more room at the
81:33 - top I mean it's not bad I don't want it
81:35 - I don't want this to be
81:37 - overwhelming so I think if we just move
81:39 - it down a bit bump it up to 20
81:44 - pixels I think that'll work especially
81:46 - since this this is smaller now we'll
81:49 - probably go a bit smaller with that
81:51 - font I think that's
81:59 - decent so let me find that i' I've given
82:02 - this a class of uh Fus
82:05 - branding um so we'll just move this I I
82:09 - did change this
82:11 - to 16 and we'll
82:17 - add
82:20 - W the indentation stuff is crazy I
82:25 - need I had a package for Adam that was
82:27 - Auto indenting everything for me and it
82:29 - was awesome but it was messing up the um
82:33 - so we're using prettier and then so it
82:36 - was messing up stuff with prettier so
82:39 - that basically like it was changing the
82:42 - positioning in all my files and it would
82:46 - look like I had something to commit to
82:48 - get when all that had happened is my
82:51 - atom plugin had changed the formatting
82:54 - from what prettier had made it and it
82:56 - just kept flipping back and forth so I
82:57 - disabled it but now my my auto indenting
83:00 - is gone so I have to sort that
83:08 - out all
83:12 - right if you heard that that was my the
83:15 - I have an eight Monon old and that was
83:17 - her in the background yelling yelling
83:20 - for me so
83:24 - um
83:32 - okay so let's make this a bit
83:38 - smaller this is starting I mean this is
83:41 - getting to the point where I think it's
83:44 - close also there's just like there's a
83:47 - little weirdness of I've gotten used to
83:50 - the so used to the other one anything I
83:51 - do now is going to look weird at first
83:53 - to me so once I get over
83:57 - that uh I think I'll be able to look at
84:00 - this a bit more objectively and see
84:02 - whether or not it's it
84:04 - works uh but I think
84:07 - that maybe just a bit smaller on that
84:10 - size and
84:12 - then maybe move it down a
84:18 - little yeah and I think that'll
84:21 - work
84:39 - [Music]
84:46 - okay
84:51 - um
84:54 - yeah that's not too bad let me know what
84:56 - you think in the live chat if you
84:57 - haven't
85:01 - already oh awesome Patrick just said in
85:04 - the live chat uh they have a prettier
85:06 - atom
85:07 - plugin that's great I'll um I'll have to
85:11 - check that out oh aim high joined us hey
85:14 - how's it
85:17 - going uh aimh High say I just followed
85:19 - you on Twitter awesome so
85:22 - yeah I'll definitely um I'll check that
85:25 - out uh in I think the last stream or one
85:29 - of our recent streams uh a high said uh
85:34 - like told us about a job a new job so
85:37 - did you start yet uh or were you
85:40 - starting I can't remember if you said
85:42 - when you were going to start or not if
85:43 - you did start how is
85:50 - it all right umber to say it almost
85:52 - seems like there needs to be something
85:54 - in the space to the right of the brand
85:56 - to balance out the slogan but it might
85:59 - be
86:04 - weird yeah I'm with you like it it
86:09 - just it does look a little weird maybe
86:11 - if I move this in and make it bigger
86:14 - it'll
86:16 - balance a
86:20 - bit yeah I'll let me try that uh let me
86:24 - make sure I bring
86:25 - over the changes that I
86:31 - made
86:36 - and let
86:51 - see
87:21 - for
87:24 - [Music]
87:26 - oh okay amh high is going to start on
87:27 - Monday the 3 all right well good
87:32 - luck I hope everything is uh is awesome
87:36 - at your new job super excited about
87:40 - that oh Isaiah asks why is it better to
87:44 - convert the website to
87:45 - reactjs
87:47 - so um while I'm adjusting the size here
87:50 - I'll talk a little bit about that
87:52 - um
87:54 - reacts so react has a lot of advantages
87:58 - um in this case for me converting it
88:03 - from a static site to
88:06 - react uh meant that it was going to be a
88:09 - lot easier for me to import the data uh
88:14 - so on a
88:17 - static if so I wanted to import the data
88:21 - from
88:23 - uh from WordPress that was the plan all
88:24 - along the static site was like a backup
88:26 - plan to say okay well there's the
88:29 - deadlines really tight it's way faster
88:31 - for me to just code all this out than to
88:33 - either try to make a WordPress theme or
88:36 - make the react site that I eventually
88:37 - wanted to so that was just kind of the
88:40 - backup plan that I know I could get this
88:42 - out but the problem with that is if you
88:44 - wanted to update that static site I had
88:46 - to go in and update it in the
88:49 - code there are people there are like
88:51 - student work workers who work for the
88:53 - kakal Institute that need to be able to
88:55 - update it and they don't have any
88:57 - experience with code so I need the the
88:59 - content needed to come from a Content
89:00 - management system
89:02 - so with react I can easily build a
89:06 - component uh and those components can
89:11 - then
89:14 - uh I can render all the data into those
89:16 - components specifically when I'm using
89:18 - nextjs I can pull in the data and render
89:21 - it service side so then it's great for
89:23 - search engine
89:24 - optimization uh if I were to just like
89:27 - try to turn my static site and like do
89:30 - some custom you know JavaScript
89:32 - templates for that uh and pull that in
89:36 - client side I would have no search
89:38 - engine optimization all right uh and
89:41 - just so for me specifically those were a
89:44 - big deal but this in general react is
89:47 - really a nice way to do things um
89:50 - especially if you need
89:54 - like if you need things to happen on
89:55 - your site where there's going to be
89:56 - changes to the Dom instead of doing it
89:58 - all with jQuery which is what people I
90:01 - guess would normally do um react has a
90:04 - different way of doing things and it
90:05 - keeps like this alternate version of the
90:08 - Dom and it compares the two to only
90:12 - change things that need change instead
90:14 - of rendering everything so you end up
90:16 - getting better
90:18 - performance uh when things change on
90:21 - your site
90:22 - um the other things too like it does
90:25 - client side routing you know nicely so
90:27 - you notice like you click around on this
90:29 - site uh there's not page refreshes so
90:33 - there's just so many uh cool things that
90:37 - react does really well and it's not that
90:39 - you couldn't do it like I it's not that
90:42 - I couldn't have done all that stuff with
90:43 - a static site but it would have been
90:46 - really complicated for me to do it on my
90:48 - own and then trying for somebody else to
90:51 - try to keep up with that would have been
90:52 - insane like you know if I made my own
90:56 - custom routing solution and all that it
90:59 - uh and and I probably would have done it
91:02 - given the time frame I would have used
91:05 - uh jQuery so it would have been very
91:07 - hard to
91:09 - maintain I'm sure there's other benefits
91:11 - to react to that I'm just I'm forgetting
91:13 - or that I don't know
91:14 - about
91:16 - but I can't find in Dev tools this uh
91:19 - background there we go finally
91:23 - uh
91:26 - so let's move this
91:31 - in a
91:34 - bit and make it
91:43 - bigger and
91:45 - then let's move it back over a bit
91:50 - now just thinking if we do it like this
91:53 - I'll probably bring that
92:08 - down I was hoping that that would make
92:11 - it seem like there I mean there's
92:13 - definitely not as much space there but
92:14 - it still doesn't exactly look
92:20 - right to be honest with you if I could
92:22 - just lose the
92:25 - tagline I think it would look fine but I
92:28 - can't like there there's no way they'll
92:29 - let me take the tagline
92:31 - out I would actually love to get rid of
92:34 - the tagline because then I wouldn't have
92:36 - to import this font which I only import
92:38 - for this
92:45 - tagline if anyone can think of a better
92:47 - place to put this
92:50 - tagline that's still appears near the
92:53 - top let me know
92:56 - because that that I think is really
92:59 - what's causing the issue for us right
93:00 - now is that this is just kind of like
93:20 - odd
93:24 - all right so I am going to save the few
93:26 - things that I did
93:32 - here
93:35 - and definitely need to think about that
93:38 - tagline some
93:39 - more so I'm probably going to wrap up
93:42 - the video soon um definitely significant
93:46 - change here but I'm to a point now where
93:49 - I think I really just need to think
93:51 - about
93:52 - I don't know about you but when I get
93:54 - like I like to mess around like this but
93:56 - at some point like I just need to close
93:58 - my eyes and like picture what this is
94:00 - going to look like and sometimes I
94:03 - actually just like JW it use a pen and
94:05 - paper and JW it down and sometimes
94:07 - that's better than just continuing to
94:10 - make
94:11 - adjustments uh and I think I'm getting
94:13 - to that point where I need to just kind
94:15 - of visualize what this could
94:19 - be I don't think it it's not
94:22 - terrible
94:23 - but I I don't you know this is the
94:26 - homepage this the first thing people are
94:28 - going to see I wanted to look really
94:30 - really good uh and this just to me does
94:33 - not look really good
94:36 - so so I'm going to finish up with the
94:39 - actual like CSS changes here I'm going
94:41 - to go back to the live chat I'm going to
94:43 - go through and try to answer all the
94:44 - questions I can so if you have a
94:46 - question throw it in there now and then
94:47 - I'm going to just I'm going to wrap it
94:49 - up I know I said the beginning I didn't
94:50 - want this to be a super long video and
94:52 - it has ended up being a pretty long
94:55 - video um I really I just kind of didn't
94:57 - want to have this giant video that was
95:00 - of low low quality but I guess too late
95:05 - for that so I'm going to I'm going to
95:07 - scroll back up to the top of the live
95:09 - chat now and uh I'll tell you the uh the
95:13 - chat has gone on long enough that I have
95:15 - missed out on some of the stuff that was
95:17 - at the very top
95:20 - so I don't think I missed out on too
95:22 - much but just in case if I do miss your
95:24 - question uh throw it in the comments or
95:27 - message me on Twitter uh you say all

96:11 - lot of these already uh but I'm just
96:14 - looking
96:15 - for uh for something that I I missed or
96:18 - maybe just didn't
96:19 - answer as as I could
96:22 - have also you if if you don't if you

97:02 - some weird some meeting that time and if
97:04 - so then I'll just change the normal time
97:06 - and I'll send out a message on
97:11 - Twitter wow I'm I'm I'm scrolling and
97:14 - I'm still not seeing anything that I
97:16 - didn't address yet so I guess I did a
97:17 - decent job of watching the live chat
97:20 - this time
97:23 - uh let's
97:26 - see I thought I saw something
97:29 - but it wasn't directed to
97:33 - [Music]
97:46 - me okay here's a question I missed uh so
97:51 - sha Shashank Shashank Mishra says Hey
97:55 - Jesse I just started with JavaScript
97:57 - which backend language should I learn it
97:58 - with
98:02 - um I
98:05 - uh this this was asked a while ago so
98:08 - hopefully you're still tuning in um but
98:11 - just for anybody else that might have a
98:12 - similar question um as well if you're
98:16 - learning JavaScript you don't NE you
98:19 - don't actually need to learn backend
98:21 - language with JavaScript because you
98:23 - could use JavaScript on the server side
98:26 - as well so you could use node it depends
98:28 - on what you want to do though so like
98:31 - for instance it let's say you wanted to
98:34 - work with WordPress then learn PHP do
98:37 - you want to work with Microsoft stuff
98:39 - like NET Framework then learn learn
98:42 - c um do you want to
98:46 - develop I mean I do you want to end up
98:48 - developing for uh for mobile you know
98:52 - for Android uh Java or actually what's
98:55 - the new thing now I think it's called
98:56 - cotlin so you might want one of those
98:58 - but then again you could always just use
99:00 - react native and then just learn
99:03 - JavaScript so depending on what you want
99:06 - to do the answer is going to be
99:08 - different but if you don't have anything
99:10 - in particular in mind I personally would
99:13 - just stick with JavaScript learn that
99:14 - really well and learn server side so
99:16 - learn node uh and then you'll be good
99:19 - you can build entire application
99:22 - uh just with
99:24 - JavaScript um but otherwise I mean if
99:28 - you have the time and you want to learn
99:30 - something then then just you know figure
99:32 - out what you want to do and then pick
99:35 - the backend language based on
99:37 - that uh Dimitri says great videos helps
99:40 - a lot thanks Jesse awesome thank you for
99:43 - saying that I appreciate you watching
99:46 - too um Joshua says what do you like to
99:49 - use for accepting credit card payments
99:51 - with react actually I've never done an
99:53 - e-commerce site with react uh I have
99:56 - done a couple that were just like
99:57 - straight up WordPress sites uh I've used
100:02 - um I think I've used stripe obviously
100:06 - PayPal everybody's use PayPal before and
100:08 - I use um authorized.net
100:12 - so those are I think the three that I've
100:14 - worked with of the three the hardest to
100:16 - work was probably authorize.net stripe
100:19 - is super simple to work with PayPal is
100:21 - pretty simple as well so uh it might
100:24 - just come down
100:26 - to uh the rates really uh or if you're
100:29 - doing it because and this of course like
100:32 - I said I haven't done it with react so I
100:34 - don't know if any of those would
100:37 - be harder to work with in react but at
100:40 - least for what I had to do with them in
100:41 - WordPress which to be honest was mostly
100:43 - plug-in based so it's not like I was
100:45 - hardcoding like PHP or anything so uh
100:49 - but I found stripe and PayPal to be the
100:51 - easiest and this was this was a few
100:54 - years ago the last time I had to do an
100:55 - e-commerce site so uh you just keep that
100:59 - in mind when you consider my
101:02 - answer and Ahmed
101:05 - said oh okay Ahmed was having a like a
101:08 - side discussion with someone else so
101:10 - I'll skip that
101:16 - um let
101:19 - see
101:22 - oh James wait back an hour ago James
101:26 - said uh ask what's happening actually I
101:29 - think I did see that I think I I
101:31 - addressed that question so for a second
101:33 - I felt really bad uh because James James
101:36 - says hey I'm a Noob here what's
101:37 - happening so I really really especially
101:40 - like to answer people who are new answer
101:42 - their questions um so that you know they
101:46 - feel welcome right off the bat um
101:51 - XD said we have a nerds meeting here I
101:54 - didn't see that the first time
102:03 - but quiet okay looks like there's a
102:06 - decent conversation going on about react
102:08 - native so uh the video is already really
102:10 - long I'm not going to read everything
102:11 - out but that was awesome uh if if you if
102:15 - you're watching the recording and you
102:16 - haven't got a chance to join in live I
102:18 - definitely like recommend it if if you
102:20 - ever get a chance because there's so
102:22 - many very knowledgeable people in the
102:24 - live chat that provide so much help if
102:27 - you ask a question um they're just
102:29 - really great it's kind of a nice little
102:32 - Community uh that's developed in the
102:34 - live chat and they're they're super
102:36 - helpful and and super nice so uh join in
102:40 - if if you
102:49 - can
102:51 - uh Joshua ask have you had any success
102:53 - with stripe in react okay this is so as
102:56 - as I said earlier I have not done any
102:59 - e-commerce with reacts not
103:19 - yet
103:21 - okay Patrick asks uh what npm module
103:23 - lets you use class instead of class name
103:27 - uh let me let me check really quick
103:31 - because where was that I had brought up
103:34 - contributors I know it was in a was it
103:38 - Dan I think it was Danny that
103:40 - contributed
103:42 - that
103:49 - um let me see
103:51 - I was hoping it would link right to that
103:54 - here can I see it
103:56 - here uh I guess
104:02 - not I guess I'll just check my package
104:06 - Json
104:08 - um I don't remember offand but I'm sure
104:10 - if I see it I'll I'll remember right
104:13 - away so let's check in here oh here we
104:16 - go Babble plug-in react HTML
104:21 - attribute to ATS so I don't if you could
104:23 - see that one that's the one and then I
104:26 - think there was some configuration maybe
104:29 - in this Babel RC yeah so I had to add
104:34 - this in and conf as well I didn't add
104:36 - this in uh Patrick added I'm pretty sure
104:39 - not Patrick uh Danny added this in uh
104:42 - I'm pretty sure that was the the pull
104:44 - request from from Danny so
104:48 - um anyway but it's really help ful so
104:51 - thanks for that that pool
104:54 - request um and that's the uh that's the
104:58 - module and I'm pretty sure it does work
105:01 - um it's not just for class it's for the
105:03 - other the other attributes as well so um
105:08 - I'm going to get spoiled by it and then
105:09 - work on a project where I don't have it
105:11 - and then mess it up but it's really cool
105:14 - for
105:19 - now
105:31 - [Music]
105:37 - okay cool it looks like um pretty much
105:39 - everybody was saying that the resolution
105:41 - was fine so that's good to know uh maybe
105:45 - I finally got the right settings here
105:47 - and I can actually stream from home so
105:50 - uh I'll do I'm going to check out the
105:51 - video later on and and play it back and
105:53 - just kind of see what the quality was uh
105:56 - but if if it's decent then maybe I am I
105:59 - will be able to stream from home so I
106:01 - that's really good because then it
106:04 - doesn't really matter the only thing
106:06 - that was bothering me about not being
106:07 - able to go in to work uh to do my work
106:10 - was just not being able to
106:12 - stream so if I can do it from
106:15 - home then then it can take their time
106:18 - and block GitHub for as long as they
106:20 - want and I I'll enjoy working from
106:26 - [Music]
106:49 - home
106:55 - someone who's uh I I can't read this
106:57 - name because it's it's not in like nor
106:59 - my normal
107:02 - alphabet it says says what the hell in
107:05 - here so I was not sure you know what I
107:09 - bet that this person joined in right
107:11 - when I had my style.css file open so
107:14 - that was the appropriate response
107:19 - so
107:34 - okay looks like I'm seeing like a a few
107:37 - different um comments of just kind of
107:41 - adjusting things uh so I'm going to save
107:43 - I'm going to look over that later uh
107:45 - when I finish up these adjustments but
107:48 - uh I'm going to skip over it for now so
107:50 - I can make sure I get to everybody's
107:57 - [Music]
108:08 - questions man I'm I I was just getting
108:11 - hammered today with all the the comments
108:13 - I'm I'm never showing my style.css file
108:16 - on a stream again this is like Patrick
108:19 - says I've never seen a mini map with a
108:21 - scroll bar before uh
108:25 - so I'm just messing around you guys are
108:27 - you're fine I I can take it and I agree
108:31 - with
108:34 - [Music]
108:38 - you XD says I prefer to be refactoring
108:41 - while coding so yeah uh this was in
108:44 - response I think when I was talking
108:46 - about saying I just kept putting off
108:48 - actually you know organizing everything
108:50 - the way it should be I I really do too
108:53 - like I like to refactor like immediately
108:55 - after I get it working and everything
108:57 - and then refactor
108:59 - but these are these are all all things
109:01 - that are best practices that you get you
109:04 - all are mentioning and uh
109:07 - so uh I did not follow those for this
109:15 - project okay some some people were
109:18 - asking about the um
109:21 - oh let me go back to here this image so
109:23 - it's actually uh this is called a monstr
109:27 - so uh m o n s r a n c a monstr so I I
109:32 - guess it sounded like I was saying
109:33 - monster so yeah so it's actually a
109:36 - monstr so I had a few questions about
109:38 - that in the live chat so uh this is in
109:42 - the middle here is what's called uh the
109:45 - Eucharist so I mean this is like in
109:47 - terms of Catholicism this is like the
109:50 - most important thing
109:53 - um uh about like the entire worship like
109:57 - if you ever been to to a Catholic like
110:00 - worship ceremony it's called a mass and
110:02 - this is like the Highlight so anyway I
110:04 - mean I don't I don't want to go into a
110:06 - big uh discussion here because this is a
110:08 - coding thing but basically just know
110:10 - that these monstrances are supposed to
110:13 - be like very beautiful because it holds
110:16 - something very important so uh that's
110:19 - what this is a pict picture of so in
110:21 - terms of The catechetical Institute
110:23 - Their audience for this are going to be
110:26 - um people who work within the Catholic
110:28 - church so they're going to like
110:30 - immediately when they see this it's
110:31 - going to be a very powerful image for
110:33 - them uh so that's why we wanted to
110:36 - include it right here and it was
110:37 - important but yes but it's not it's not
110:39 - monster it is a
110:41 - monstrance um and to be honest with you
110:44 - the word is probably came from Latin and
110:46 - I know quite a bit of Latin but I right
110:48 - now I I can't tell you what that word
110:51 - originally came from uh
110:54 - but anyway uh let's
111:06 - see okay so we have some comments about
111:08 - the the tagline and things so
111:18 - um
111:20 - okay so we're asking about like
111:22 - potentially could we make this um
111:24 - smaller and then put this tagline under
111:26 - it I'd actually I was kind of thinking
111:28 - about that but
111:33 - um
111:34 - do I I think that we want to keep it
111:38 - bigger but it may if I can't think of
111:40 - anything else that may be something we
111:42 - go to is to just have this as a very
111:45 - small kind of image in the top and have
111:48 - this under well off to try it out but
111:50 - I'm pretty sure
111:53 - that this looks better when it's
111:56 - bigger but we'll see there's definitely
111:58 - room for uh kind of you know messing
112:02 - around with it I guess
112:07 - um Al Allan says bless you so I don't
112:11 - know I don't I guess that was directed
112:13 - to me so thank you um Isaiah says how do
112:17 - you come up with designs for your
112:18 - website
112:21 - [Music]
112:23 - um basically so I start off everything
112:27 - the basis for all the designs are is uh
112:29 - material design so Google's uh design
112:32 - framework is called material design if
112:34 - you haven't checked it out just type in
112:36 - into a Google search the first thing
112:38 - that comes up most likely will be
112:39 - Google's documentation on material
112:42 - design um really nice I I really like it
112:45 - the more I the more I learn about it and
112:47 - get into it the more I appreciate it so
112:49 - um That's the basis for my design I'd
112:51 - like I like it because it's a pretty
112:54 - standard thing it's used for a lot of
112:55 - sites so from a user's perspective the
112:58 - design patterns will be familiar the way
113:00 - the UI Works will be familiar so I like
113:03 - that if a user comes to one of my sites
113:05 - they'll see things that they've most
113:06 - likely seen on other sites or apps uh so
113:10 - it just I don't know I think it just
113:12 - makes things a little bit more
113:13 - comfortable for the user for me it gives
113:15 - me the benefit of not having to make
113:17 - every single decision about the design
113:19 - so I start from
113:21 - there and then I adapt based on what the
113:25 - needs are so you know whatever whatever
113:28 - the client or whoever from that I'm
113:30 - working with uh whatever they need
113:33 - sometimes I do have to adapt things uh
113:36 - to accommodate that or sometimes they
113:38 - have very distinct like preferences for
113:41 - style that I try to blend as best I can
113:44 - with material design principles so not
113:47 - every single thing on the site will
113:49 - follow material design spec exactly
113:52 - because occasionally I I I need to kind
113:55 - of be a little bit flexible to be able
113:57 - to try to blend the style that the
113:59 - client wants with that uh but for the
114:02 - most part I do try to follow material
114:04 - design Styles and then when I'm actually
114:06 - thinking about design stuff sometimes
114:08 - like I just throw it on there and just
114:10 - move it around see how it works I like
114:13 - to draw things out on paper I'm a
114:14 - terrible terrible artist when it comes
114:16 - to drawing but I can at least get like a
114:19 - visual of where things are laid out so I
114:21 - wouldn't consider myself a designer but
114:23 - I do have to do design work uh so that's
114:26 - kind of like my my process for uh for
114:29 - design and it's uh it's I've never
114:32 - undergone any like formal training for
114:33 - design or anything so I'm I'm sure that
114:36 - there are more efficient ways of doing
114:37 - that uh but this is just what I've kind
114:40 - of developed out of necessity of having
114:42 - to do
114:44 - this
114:48 - um oh
114:50 - uh sudu I'm not sure how to pronounce
114:54 - that sorry if I mispronounced your name
114:56 - ask can you please suggest some tutorial
114:57 - for Python and D Jango I don't know
115:00 - about D Jango but uh for python Udacity
115:04 - um intro to CSS course is done all in
115:08 - Python and uh I like that course so that
115:11 - might be something that uh you might
115:14 - want to check into and then supplement
115:16 - that with something that's more Django
115:19 - specific
115:20 - as
115:22 - well Alexandre says hello hey how's it
115:29 - going Matt says the Django website
115:31 - actually has a really good intro
115:33 - tutorial
115:40 - Cool J j503 Cool says it kind of looks
115:45 - like an old school WordPress
115:47 - design honestly I'm not going to lie the
115:50 - header to me especially when I've shrunk
115:52 - it like this does look more old school
115:55 - than so like the the header as it
115:58 - currently is
116:03 - um this does not look like an old school
116:06 - design but this is starting to look more
116:09 - like an old school
116:11 - design I didn't realize it until you
116:13 - said it but as soon as I saw that
116:15 - comment I totally agree and now I feel
116:18 - terrible about it
116:21 - I guess
116:22 - there's yeah now I I like it so much
116:26 - less now that you said
116:28 - that we'll see maybe I'll have to think
116:30 - about it even more but I mean at the end
116:32 - of the day like I
116:35 - um I just need to
116:38 - include these El basically every element
116:41 - that's in here right now has to be in
116:42 - there somewhere so I have to include
116:45 - them all I can do some rearranging of
116:47 - things but as long as they're all in in
116:49 - there it should be okay so I guess we
116:53 - have some room if if anyone has any
116:55 - other suggestions as long as
116:57 - everything's included it might actually
116:59 - work so uh let me
117:02 - know
117:04 - um but yeah I'll have to think about
117:06 - that this ended up being more difficult
117:09 - than I'd
117:10 - anticipated hopefully the end result is
117:12 - worth it though uh I might do an
117:14 - alternate version where the change is
117:16 - less drastic where maybe I I just shrink
117:19 - it everything
117:20 - slightly if I can't get this one to work
117:24 - and then maybe it'll work it'll work
117:26 - better like
117:27 - that but um anyway I uh I think that's
117:31 - it for today and uh yeah we've
117:33 - definitely dropped below our normal
117:35 - amount of viewers at this point so um
117:39 - thank you for
117:40 - watching and I will I won't be back for
117:44 - a while so next Wednesday will probably
117:46 - be the next time I do a stream so um
117:49 - have a great weekend everyone and uh if
117:51 - you're in in the United States uh have a

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody it's Jesse and um I am streaming from home today and uh if you if you saw the uh two other times where I tried to stream from home you know that the quality is not good so um I I adjusted my settings a lot I don't expect the quality to be good but hopefully the the buffering is a little bit better uh so I'm also today I'm going to try to keep this uh a little bit short and I'm going to do some things that are less code intensive and there'll be more visual feedback you know on the actual website and that should be a little bit easier to see with the decreased quality uh so normally you know I would do this uh from my office unfortunately uh my actually looks like I'm seeing from the live chat the volume is really low as well so let me let me see if I can do anything about that um so my employer has blocked all access to GitHub which which I I mean I really can't I can't work very well without that so I'm going to try to do a stream here I'm hoping that by next week we get access again uh otherwise I just I will I'll be working from home a lot so I can access GitHub I won't have a lot of um I don't know I won't have a lot of time in the office to be able to stream so I'll have to figure something out um maybe I can definitely do prerecorded videos um I see yeah I'm working on the I'm working on the volume now I'm not sure what the problem is okay I found it now is that better at all uh the volume oh wait a second for a response here um yeah I'll expl so um I got some questions why would they block GitHub so so you guys have heard the uh like the Peta ransomware thing that's going on uh it's not really ransomware I guess they're saying now it just is a a wiper um so okay is it better now yeah actually in in my sound settings so in in OBS that's my streaming software the sound settings were fine but in the actual settings for my Mac somehow the input volume for the microphone got turned almost completely down and I'm not sure how that happened I don't remember doing that but um but that happened that actually makes sense because yesterday I was doing a Skype meeting with this this laptop and um they were having trouble hearing uh people talking so that's probably the reason but anyway um so someone in the IT department is on a list serve and someone on that list serve emailed out to everybody that they had actually seen this virus this this Peta or not Peta whatever they're calling it now they'd seen it when it first got you know started to uh do its work and they noticed that they downloaded something from GitHub and that was the the only message right so based on that they shut down GitHub uh luckily one of my coworkers alerted me to that on Wednesday so I didn't even bother coming in that's why I didn't do a stream on Wednesday yesterday it they had reactivated they they unblocked it so I could get access to it so yesterday I was actually able to go in the office but then I had during my normal stream time I had a really long meeting uh um and then even earlier on I I had some meetings early in the day so my whole day was taken up so I couldn't do a stream like I wanted to stream yesterday but I just didn't hadn't have the time so then I went into work today and the first thing I always do is try to do a get pool and it wouldn't work and so then I tried to do tried to go on GitHub and it wouldn't work so I called over uh to the IT department and they had in fact blocked GitHub again and uh when when I asked how long it would be they said oh not that long and I I said well were we talking like days and they said yeah hopefully just days so evidently they're waiting for their antivirus software to come out with an update that protects them against this ransomware and when that update comes out then they will unblock GitHub so that's the story so I'm I really this really stink because I have a lot of work to do and I also want to stream uh I haven't streamed that much lately this week and I I miss it I miss all you guys uh and girls and uh so hopefully this all gets resolved and I can get back to my normal streaming and you don't have to suffer through this terrible quality uh video stream um unless unless I could find somewhere else that has better internet that I could go to to work then maybe but I there's not really any like workplaces I'm I live in a small City so there's just not really a good place that has great WiFi that I can go to work but if I can find one I will hopefully it won't come to that and I can just go into the office and do it so anyway um okay I see everybody in the live chat now hey hey everyone um so I have a a lot of of news so the uh we are going to go over some CSS changes uh today I thought that would just be simple given the uh bad quality of the stream it'll be way easier to see what's going on uh but I just want to give you an overview uh the site's going to be undergoing some major changes in some parts of it so I want to give you a quick overview of what's going to happen I'm going to try to stream as much of it as I can and also I'd like your input on some things uh I will say um I probably only have maybe I think until July around July 19th I need to be pulled off of this project and go to another project so everything that's going to happen needs to happen by July 15th so in addition to what we were already working on before the the biggest thing that I was working on that needs to happen is I need to get all the content of the entire site to be editable from WordPress so I need to be able to pull in all that content either in one API call or figure out how to make multiple API calls with nextjs and how they do their server side rendering so but that's maybe I'll do a video about that um so I have some ideas hopefully I'll get to that so here's what's going to change I'm just going to go through really quickly the change changes the most major changes uh the the really long meeting that I had yesterday was all about changes that need to happen to this site so what we're going to do is we're going to make this whole section smaller so this was pretty like our hero section but it's it's going to become more of just a really big nav basically so this is going to shrink up a bit this will get smaller this text here will get smaller this text and this low logo will get larger now I'm not sure about the size of this logo if I can even make it larger without it getting pixelated so I have to check I think I might be like at the upper end of the range here so uh we'll see maybe maybe I can get a better quality um image that I could make bigger uh so and this is all based uh I got a ton of feedback from several different people that are in this department this kakal institute Department so um I can't really these are pretty much Set uh since I it wasn't really my call for a lot of this stuff although I I did have my input um a lot of this is kind of set so we can't can't really change it the other thing that needs to change is this bar here needs to get a little taller and this text needs to be a larger font size and maybe even a heavier font weight we'll see how that looks um now this is Big this looks terrible now um be just the um where the video was stopped at I was playing the video I guess it a low quality but basically let me do a refresh just so you could see what the thumbnail is for this video there's going to be a full screen video section so this will be a lot smaller so you'll be able to see like half of this and you're going to scroll down and this is a full screen video um I don't know if we'll stick with the YouTube INB bed or if I'll actually pull in the video um but it's going to be click to play I'm not going to autoplay it but this is a video introduction from the head of the kakal Institute that's who the site's for um does like a voice over uh so the we have a videographer in my department who's pretty really good and and he put this together so we're going to put this here uh this section which I had added is is not going to be included um after we we had to talk more about what the goals of the website are which we should have known this from the outset but I think it just took a while for everyone to get really figure out what they wanted this website to do so we moved the mission statement down here instead of it having its own section the quote that was here is actually mentioned in the video so it'll still get in there this section here this formation section is going to be moved up above so so it'll be video the formation section with the four cards and then the mission below it and then below that we'll have announcements like we still we have here and then we're going to add a contact form and then just our normal footer so the homepage is undergoing very significant changes uh there are the about page is going to have uh some links to some informational Pages uh so there I'm just going to have to change it a little bit to include a section there that can display links so I'm not no no use in actually checking that page out at this point the let me let me check the chat real quick in case someone had um some comments on this um okay okay I can see I did have some comments about the whole like GitHub being being blocked thing uh Grayson says uh I can see from a security perspective it makes sense it does get in the way it workflow but I don't want data L yeah um I don't know that it realizes how much I use GitHub and um the the one other person that does um this kind of work in my department uses GitHub uh because it doesn't use GitHub they use some really um old form of Version Control uh it's like a propri AR system I forget what it's called like they were using visual Source visual Source safe or something and now they're using like some Vault thing I don't really know but for them it wasn't a big deal to block it because they never use it uh so yeah I still think the best thing for them to do would be to make sure that all their stuff has the uh the upgrade for the SMB V1 which is from what I understand what that virus is is using uh to do to to get in and actually uh infect everything it seems to me from what I've read if if you have that installed then you should be fine but um let see okay um Emanuel asks why not just make it a WordPress theme and I I know we've gone over this before but I like keep getting that question and uh the reason the reason basically is uh this is using react right now um it's late it's too late in the game to change it to Wordpress theme anyway um but uh there are some advantages to doing it this way as opposed to a traditional WordPress theme and um I'm actually I I don't think I'm not going to go through it all because I know I've done it in past videos but I'll let some people in the live chat fill fill you in on the uh the advantages but basically at this point it just there's no way I could convert this into a WordPress theme fast enough uh for when I need to have this all done um let's see okay John Hansen says uh could convert the uh the logo that's a PNG uh into an SVG and says it works great fairly quick to do all right awesome I hadn't even thought of that but that is a great idea so uh I'll give that if I need to I'll give that a try I do prefer to use svgs whenever I can anyway um Sebastian says well Chrome and kerski decided that YouTube was not secure uh yeah I don't yeah Scott's giving some um some other options for what source control they use TFS IBM uh subversion it's not subversion it might be TFS I don't know I guess it it doesn't matter really but uh I it's definitely not it's not the IBM moment and it's not subversion uh they did use like the old Microsoft one and um that's like not supported anymore uh but they've I'm pretty sure they've switched off of that one onto this new one uh so anyway I'll continue on the the only other section that is getting major changes is the resource section also the event section the uh the geolocation stuff is now live and I do want to thank um Patrick because he submitted two pool requests uh that were kind of in relation to that section let me see um I wonder if he's on uh I just want to bring up the uh contributor section here just to give credit to everyone uh who's been contributing so here we go so uh thanks I zoom in on that a bit I know the quality is bad so hopefully you can see that but uh here's everyone who's contributed this uh so far and I really really appreciate uh all your contributions they've made this so much better than it would have been and I've learned so much from going through uh your code that you've submitted and uh I've already uh I was I was working on just some some little side projects some fun projects uh when I was on vacation and uh I was going back to your pool requests that you all submitted and uh figuring out how everything was done so that I could do it that way on my newer projects uh so really awesome I really appreciate that uh let me go is my resources working there we go uh so the right now the resources section uh is not it's not working exactly as expected the the idea was that it would be it would look kind of like Pinterest right but Pinterest has IM for everything and as you can see there's only one image right now the problem is a lot of the images for these were just way too small and look terrible when they were actually in here uh so the layout for this is going to completely change uh so just briefly uh these will probably stay here and the search will stay here somewhere in the middle and the search might get smaller maybe somewhere in the middle there's just going to be a toggle between free and paid resource ources so it's just going to toggle back and forth I may or may not even keep an icon that denotes whether something's free or paid uh because we'll just have the toggle I I'll see I basically there's probably not going to be a view that includes both free and paid resources together so it may not even be necessary to have this icon we're going to have a drop down here that has a ton of categories the the example given that I'm so basically the people who are in charge of the this institute that I'm doing the website for they want it to be like Amazon okay so basically in the next like two weeks maybe three weeks uh I'm going to try to turn this into Amazon as closely as I can and uh now I I'm definitely not going to try to recreate everything that Amazon does but I'm basically going to make it so that a user could come in here they could pick a category then so they could choose whether they want free or paid then choose a category and then choose whether they want audio or text and then search within that so you can filter down like to very small uh set of of things that you want um so that's that's how the filtering is going to work and then for the UI these cards are going to go away and it's going to look more like a list so I know there's like material design lists let me see let me see if I can show you an example of what it's going to look like or at least in my head what I think it's going to look like so I just did some sketches on paper during the meeting just so that I remembered uh but yeah it's basically going to look kind of have this list uh kind of look where I'm trying to find if there's a a better example down far there okay so this is I guess a decent example where it's going to be more like a list a one column list there'll be images on this side title uh the description will actually be hidden by default but you can click to read more so it'll enable them that to make really long descriptions if they want them uh and it won't mess up the flow of the page and cause a lot of scrolling uh so there'll be a little little arrow to drop down the description or hide the description um and then there'll be just some other basic information about each resource so that'll require a little bit on the WordPress end of things to add the custom fields for that um but then on the UI side of things it'll be you know we'll be changing that significantly uh probably making a new new react component for that uh so that's it those are the major changes that are going to happen uh there there are some other things that are going to happen but they're not it's not really worth talking about it's a lot of a lot more you know kind of minor things so today what I wanted to work on was doing all the changes that I talked about for this section so let me uh I'm just going to check the live chat quickly all right yeah uh philli was responding is uh someone had asked about why not just do it as a WordPress theme and Philip responded and said speed easier load balancing I think not using PHP yeah there's some there there are so many reasons there maybe isn't like one reason that's like for sure you should go this way but there were so many small reasons when you add them all up it made sense for me to do it like this uh and yeah not having to do a lot of PHP template things was a big plus for me because I'm not nothing there's nothing wrong with PHP that's just not where I want to go with my career and my learning path so I want to I want to go more with JavaScript and react and I think it'll be easier in the future given the growth of of react someone to maintain this site if I could just say hey this is just an HTML CSS JavaScript site basically with react someone could step right in if they had knowledge of JavaScript and probably pick up enough of react that they could do it I don't I don't need to say in a job description let's say for somebody who might replace me one day and say you have to know PHP all right I don't need that so anyway but there there's a lot of um a lot of reasons um not to say there's nothing wrong with WordPress um temp my own personal site is just a regular WordPress site with WordPress templates um Octavian says it's too boring to stay longer cheers to everybody see see you Octavian uh I'm sure Octavian is not here anymore but uh if if parts of the video are super boring to any of you let me know what parts are boring and then I will try to just cut those out uh I don't mind if if a part's really useful and boring that's okay but if it's boring and it's not useful to anybody then yeah I just want to cut it out so um yeah if anybody else thinks it's boring before you leave please let me know uh what exactly is the boring part um XDS which project is that it is it's the um uh the CI react oh yeah you so github.com Fus hyphen marcom slci react the link is in the description for the video this branch is called let me let me give you the branch name so you could it's called home hyphen alt so I'm working on that Branch right now if you want to check out any of the code all right okay Amed says the user interface design looks totally stunning to me uh awesome so uh thank you I'm I'm glad you think that uh yeah so I mean you all that have been watching for a while like we we worked really hard on this I really really appreciate you saying that um XD says would be cool would take it out of Wordpress yeah um I've thought about like totally not having WordPress involved at all but it just wasn't like going with a completely different content management system I the time frame that I had for this I just knew I wouldn't be able to do that uh in this time frame but if there is a A system that would be more lightweight and still as userfriendly as WordPress in terms of someone with no coding experience being able to come come in and input data then I'd definitely be open to that specifically I would love it if there was something that was well tested and reliable that could run uh off of node and then that way I could totally cut out the need for any PHP knowledge uh and it would just be uh JavaScript you know across the board uh ibuka asks uh just to confirm the site is built with nextjs yes it is it is built with nextjs um HED says nothing is boring Jesse you're doing great yeah honestly if someone's really Advanced at this my videos probably would be somewhat boring because I mean they'd already know all this so unless they're here to help me out it's you know it's going to be it's going to be pretty boring so anyway uh as long as people are still watching this and they still appreciate what I'm doing I'm still going to do it it do I mean if it's boring to some people that's fine there are like millions of videos out there that they could watch that may be less boring to them um okay uh XD says put some configuration instructions in the read me yeah I definitely should uh I've thought that before but it's just always been really low on the list um initially because I didn't think anybody would be working on it but now that you all are helping with it that that's going to move higher up on my list of things to do John John says LOL boring this is supposed to be your regular day as an expiring developer I want to know when it's boring valuable info besides I watch this while I codes so no problems okay cool yeah that is true I mean it is supposed to be my regular day and sometimes things are boring so uh I guess that's the point of the video then if my day is boring then the video ends up being boring I try to pick the uh most interesting thing of the day that I will be working on to record but there it's not always fun stuff all right so I'm going to go um philli says thumbs down for Drupal and jumla yeah I agree I've used them both before as well I I don't of Drupal jumla and WordPress WordPress to me by far is the easiest one to use um they actually the partner site to this so this is the site that's more like the marketing site and just informational and then there's going to be a learning management system that is actually built on Drupal that's not ready yet but it should be ready by the 15th of July and when it is then I'm going to link to it from there that site is built with Drupal uh the good thing is I guess because we're just basically pulling in everything through an API if I I needed to pull in data from the learning management system uh they could just expose all that data through an API and Drupal I guess and I could pull that data Ino and then I wouldn't actually have to develop anything for Drupal so uh but it's nobody uh they actually hired an outside company uh to do that so I'm not directly involved in any of that work all right so I'm I'm going to go I'm going to come back to the live chat but I want to work on um some of this uh this section first I don't think it's going to take a long time so I'll do some work for I don't know like 10 or 15 minutes on this and I'll check back in with the live chat hopefully we can get this to a point where it's it looks it's decently you know kind of what we want and uh then I'll answer all your questions and everything in the live chat uh if you can't stick around till the end of the video to get your question answered please put it in the comments or direct message me on Twitter and then I will I will answer your question um whenever I get a chance within the next few days or so all right so first thing let's just work on so these are three different components actually so this I think it's three I think this is a nav component this is the hero section and then this is the sticky nav so we'll be working on all three of those components it is possible that I made this one component I can't even remember um when I did that but we'll find out here uh so this is the hero component and let me know if I need to blow this up even bigger I did preview the video and uh the quality was not great so I'm going to try to be as descriptive as I can you know as I'm talking about this so that you can if you can't see the code you can at least uh get an idea of what's going on there so yeah this hero section yeah so I think that is two separate components so we're doing we're going to drop the uh Tex size the font size of this so right now it's 100 pixels and let's drop this down this is drop it down to 75 for now and then I actually I want to increase the padding at the top a bit so I'll make this 175 instead of 150 and what because what I want to do okay great that will allow me to move this make this bigger and this bigger that should move down a bit and then this will look that that's a decent a decent size we'll move this up a bit yeah I like that that that should work for now sometimes it just works out well you just guess and it it looks all right um let's see margin I could do this in Dev tools too but these these adjustments are pretty straightforward so uh what I want to make the margin 83 let's move it up let's try to make it 100 there we go yeah moved it up a bit I actually I think I want it up even more I want to see how much I can get this up here without it okay that's that's much better there uh it's it's a little bit too much right now but we're going to shrink this a bit too so I think this will work uh by moving this up so we've actually shrunk this section Now by over a 100 pixels and it still looks you know pretty close to what it was before uh so looking at it now though we probably need to bump this down a bit more if we're going to make this bigger so let's just let's do that we're going to bump this down a bit more and we're going to shrink this and then then I'm to move on to some of these other components I think that's uh that's a good start so yeah let me move this make the padding for this one 200 and if I'm going to go over this real quickly in case someone's not familiar with react and what's going on here um so this is a react component and then within this component we have what looks like basic HTML um and this is just a JavaScript class okay so react is is mostly just regular JavaScript with a little bit of um this this jsx is what lets us make the uh have the HTML kind of mixed in with the JavaScript and it works and that I mean that's just like syntactic sugar but really what's going on here is all just it's all just functions and classes and things it's basic JavaScript stuff so when we want to add a style to something we we actually put in a JavaScript object and that's how we can put inline CSS uh into our our jsx which is what this is called this this kind of mix of HTML and JavaScript okay so this works like normal um normally you do have to put class name uh there's an mpm module now installed where I don't have to use class name I can use class but if you're just working on react like for the first time and it's just straight up react you have to put class name instead of class okay so anything that's a reserved uh word in JavaScript you can't use so class name is one uh instead of using four you have to use HTML 4 those two I know there's probably other ones but uh for sure those two you have to change but otherwise you just make an object so the first bracket tells um basically the compiler that's going to change the jsx into something that browsers can handle it just tells it like Hey we're going to do some JavaScript now and then the second bracket is our object and then we put in the CSS uh and then we make it camel case instead of hyphenated like normal CSS uh and then you know we just add in uh whatever we want uh our values to be here and these are in uh uh you know in quotation marks and then we just close out our object and we close out our JavaScript and now we're right back into the HTML style uh if you want to do more than one since it's a JavaScript object you just put a comma and then you keep on going and you make more okay you could put a bunch of CSS okay now that's one way to do it there's another way and this is styled uh jsx I don't think this comes with react I think this comes builtin with next so if you're using nextjs this will work if you're using just plain react I'm I can't guarantee that this will work but you use a style tag but then you just add jsx in here you drop into JavaScript right with our bracket and then we put a template literal uh we we start a template literal this is a es6 thing um a template literal syntax uh it lets you basically make a string in JavaScript and then you can um put in JavaScript within that string and you can also have your string take up multiple lines and it still works uh so very very handy but within that then you just do regular CSS I mean all this CSS is exactly how you would do it in a normal CSS file then you just close out the template literal with your little back tick and I there's no way you all can probably see that back tick on the screen so sorry about that I'll try to make it a bit bigger um and then you close out your uh JavaScript with another bracket okay and that's how you do CSS in a react component these aren't the only ways there are a lot of other uh like modules like npm modules and things out there that you can download to help you do CSS in in your react component these are the ways that I've used and that I'm working with now I've seen like talks on a lot of other different ways so there may be better ways out there um I'm going to look that was a big explanation so I'm just going to check really quick in the chat to see if I lost anybody if had any anyone had any questions I don't want to lose especially the people that are really new to react uh I want to make sure that I can help you um kind of know what's going on as much as I can okay I'm not seeing looks like it looks like there's not any questions specifically about this in the live chat right now so I'm going to move on okay so next thing is we want to make this a bit smaller so I do have um let's see for the hero section I have a minimum height set of 80 uh I yeah I think I can drop that down I don't think I wanted to take up that much now uh we'll drop that down to 60 but then we're also going to drop our background size down to 60 to match that uh we may have to change the positioning here we'll see uh also the margin we'll just we'll see how that how that works out whoa okay I don't think I want it I don't know that I want it that small I'm not sure what do you what do you all think uh in this case I do have some some discretion here we didn't decide on exactly how small this section would get so I wasn't planning on it being this small but now that I see it I think it could be I mean obviously we'll have to position this differently and Shrink this up a bit too but I think it could be this one and work let me know what you think uh I'm I'm for now I think I'm going to move this over a little bit and I'm going to shrink this text up a bit and just see how it looks sorry if you hear anything in the background those are probably my kids and my wife shushing them so sorry about that but in case you missed the beginning I am working from home today also let me know uh how the the video quality is I expect it to not be that good and I'm sorry about that uh but let me know if it's like totally ter completely terrible like not worth continuing the video or anything like that I don't really think I can do anything about it I've set the settings you know pretty low if I do go any lower the video is going to be like really low quality it I just don't it the screen won't be the text won't be readable at that point at all um so let's I'm actually going to go into Dev tools for this because this is going to be I'm going to want to mess with these positions a bit so let me bring over move this over I don't know if it's worth it for me to bring over Dev tools uh because I don't know that I can zoom in enough for it even to be readable and I actually I do have I have media queries and stuff going on here too so let's let's make this bigger first uh because I I want to we're going to have to shrink it down and then just hit several media queries several break points so right now all I'm changing is that background position X so I'm just hitting the down arrow key on my keyboard to change that background position and and I'm wondering like do I shrink this so that the whole thing fits or do I just leave it so that it's really big like this and and partially blocked I don't really I don't know the answer to that right now I'm I'm wondering maybe I can we'll shrink it a bit I think like the largess of it has a good impact even cuz even if it's off the screen you can't see it it still appears like it's large you know that part of it's obscured but you can still get like this this size um so I kind of like that I don't know that that looks okay for now oh um I'm going to copy over what I did now and then that way you you'll be able to see it so in depth in Chrome Dev tools I made some of these adjustments and so basically we just dropped down the the X position the Y position and then I change the background size from 60 to 49 and this is 49 viewport width so the the size of the background is actually dependent on the width of the screen so it's it's kind of gives it uh responsiveness uh so it scales nicely so you can see like it's obviously smaller at this point now we're also hitting some media queries so that's that's potentially changing the size but I don't think right there yeah that break Point's not changing the size it's just changing the positioning all right see so we do have some really weird stuff happening at some points now that we'll need to work out now I don't know that it will work all that out on this video but just basically and uh at this point we've hit another breakpoint so I want to change it because that's obviously not working I don't want it to be up that high so goodness that's yeah that starts to look terrible when you get down lower we have to figure something out uh but that's okay so I'm going to change this break point so this 1200 pixel breako instead of 26% for the uh background position y I'm going to change that to negative 32% oops and an easy fix that we might do so this component actually doesn't display at all once we get small enough screen so we could instead of trying to mess with all of this we could just make it go away I mean this is depending on on how it looks I think it does make sense that probably at the point where the logo gets centered at that point this hero section should go away and so that's 900 900 or so looks like 992 so we'll set this 992 and this this media uh query controls when that is displayed right so I didn't want for users with small screens they're most likely on a mobile device so when this I didn't want them to one have to load a large image here and have a huge section to have to scroll down uh down that section so let's see all right that works we also have to adjust our media query now for the nav component to make it display at that that range all right I'm going to check the live chat again just really quickly okay Ahmed says uh aled probably already left so I don't know if he'll hear this or not but he said he's got to go because the time in India is 1243 a.m. so got to get some sleep totally understand that uh so I'll see you um hopefully next week I can get some streams in uh at a decent quality from my office uh thanks for watching ahed let's see all right looks like there's some good conversation going on in the live chat but it doesn't look like a lot is directed at me in terms of questions so oh okay it looks like uh XD said the resolution is is cool it's so cool Umberto says uh Umberto likes how it looks partially blocked so so this monit so maybe maybe we will uh increase the size and just let it be a little bit blocked I'm I'm with you there I think it you still get the sense that it's large even though you can't see all of it and since it's I mean it's basically a symmetrical thing so you can you can get even if you've never seen this is called a monstr even if you've never seen one before you can basically guess that it's going to continue to be a circle um I mean I don't I have seen one before and I've seen this whole image but it seems to me like the shape of it you know suggests basically that it keeps going around anyway so I'll work on that a bit uh Sean ask as what I was creating because just came on uh basically I'm I'm editing this this section used to be really big like a big hero section and we're shrinking it down uh to make it much shorter and so we need to make a lot of a adjustments here with the size of the image and the font size and you know how they're they're um displayed um their positioning uh Alberto says uh are you not using the hide on materialized classes yeah so uh if you've if you've been watching or you might have noticed in the code I'm using materialize as my framework for my Styles and there are already classes to hide and show things and materialize I didn't use those classes before because um I I had like custom break points that I wanted to use they didn't match up with the break points that were already built in although at this point I probably could switch to those because I think our break points are actually starting to align so originally the break points weren't lined up but now I think like this break point here does match up with the materialized break points so that's probably a good idea what would that be hide on I think that would be hide on medium and down let's do that that's certainly like a much cleaner way to do it so I'm going to try this so instead of having our showing and hiding this in some CSS that we've written we're going to try to use the class hide on medium and down so I think that's how it goes if it doesn't work at all then I'll look it up but I'm pretty sure that's the uh the way you write it and then let's take out so we won't need this actually we we'll probably I'll leave this Max height thing in because they don't have a a height uh class built in all right so let me save that and this should still hide whoops oh did I start the video accidentally started the video I keep doing that all the time I might just take the video out while I'm working so I quit accidentally starting it all right so it should disappear nice it did Umberto awesome suggestion so now we're not going to worry about doing our break points manually uh we're going to use the uh now that our break points are actually lining up with the builtin once we materialized we can just use those classes uh so that's cool let me let's see I'm going to check the live chat really quick some questions um Isaiah asked how are you structuring your code I think in CSS it's easy to have unorganized code yeah for sure it is in my CSS right now is so if you look if you check out the repo and look at my style.css file it's a mess it's really like the reason that it's a mess there's two reasons why it's why it's a mess so all this was originally built in with SAS and then just converted over to CSS so this isn't really how I wrote it you know this is the converted version so it's a little bit messed up because of that the other reason is uh I had intended most of this to actually live in the components so I didn't bother trying to organize it that much because I always figured well I'm just going to move this over into all the components at some point anyway I have slowly been moving things over but I haven't obviously I have not moved everything over so uh at some point I'd like to move it into the components but it's just not happening yet actually if anybody um if you really want to get some um I don't know like some pool requests accepted on GitHub just to like build up your portfolio maybe you're like uh want to want it to look a little bit more impressive for a job or something feel free to take that on to even if it's you just want to move a little bit over and that's cool as long as everything still works I'll definitely accept that pull request uh otherwise I might have saved some of this I have a student worker right now and I'm hopefully going to have some more student workers from the computer science department this might be a really good thing to just start them out with so that they get used to you know submitting pool requests and just some basic stuff uh cuz they're really knowledgeable about a lot of computer science things but not really about web development so kind of they need to be brought in with like little Little Steps so anyway I fully acknowledge that my CSS is a mess right now and I acknowledge that that is not ideal um XTS do you have media queries for all sizes um not really I don't I don't know I'd have to look I didn't I don't think I'm using that many media queries but maybe I am uh as I was doing this I was trying to go really fast uh like before launch so I think I did get sloppy with my media queries at some point so I probably do have a lot of them more than I need um XD ask about CSS preprocessors yes so I did use SAS but I'm not right now uh Patrick says the um the white bar at the top he's asking about the white bar so basically what happened is with that white bar is so like you can see here you can kind of see the nav here I have to adjust some stuff so this actually shows up but the nav's there and then it disappears because I have a media query to hide it at this point I just need to adjust it so when I adjusted the media query for this section it made it disappear here so there's this like basically from this wide to this wide there's this space now where there's nothing here so I just need to make the the thinner version of the nav appear there so when I go over it to edit we're about I'm about to edit that component now so I'll uh change that in a second and then that'll work um XD says you can you can split it man are you talking about my CSS yeah uh and use one style sheet for component yeah yeah that was my that was my plan that was my plan to do it so originally this site was actually just a static HTML site it was not react and that's where the majority of the styles were made in SAS for that site so that's why it was just one stylesheet like I said the idea was to split it up when it became a react site it just had it just hasn't happened as fast as I uh as I wanted to um let's see okay so XD sent said uh a PR send a PR trying to change it uh all that stuff thank you I appreciate that I'll check that out after the video yeah okay so Joshua says you need to add the SAS loader to your webpack config yes so when I first started working with nextjs that wasn't you couldn't do custom configs for webpack so this was like I don't know we're like almost on version three for next something like that this was like way back like pre version two you couldn't do that so when I started this project I would just assume that I couldn't do it and then after IID started it I realized that you could now do custom webpack configs but at that point point I had already like I was already in the middle of it and I thought you know what I don't I don't even care at this point I'm just going to keep going with it but yeah you you can add the assass loader in um and next let you do that now and uh so it's definitely possible and it would be better let's see yeah so xd's laughing at me in the live chat here because I have one file for all the Styles yeah um I mean there are actually a lot of styles within the components now too so technically I have many files but I only have one CSS file uh all right so the only thing I think I really need to do now before I move on to the nav component is make sure that this text doesn't overlap the logo and I just need to make this text a lot smaller so I'm going to have go into Dev tools on my other screen here and then at least you can see H yeah I don't it needs to be I think like at least that big it just looks way too small otherwise so all right let's go with that and move it down a bit I tell you the truth I'm I don't really like how that looks right now I think that looks bad yeah I mean look that's that looks terrible I don't know what do you think I think that looks really bad uh Joshua asked about nextjs said it you made it sound similar to create react react create app uh yeah it is it's basically does the same thing as that it just adds some other things like um uh mainly the biggest reason I use next instead of uh the create react app is server side rendering because that comes built in with next also the routing is helpful I I've learned how to do routing with react router since then but at first I didn't I wasn't that great with routing and react so the fact that next had builtin routing was also a big plus all right so I we need to do something with this I'm going to bring up I'm going to bring up the live site as a reference yeah something needs to happen because this looks really balance now so I think we need maybe this needs to come over a bit maybe be bigger there's just so much space and I'm wondering why why is this on three lines maybe I um okay so if you can see on the screen I have it in this container so that's part of the problem is that the container that it's in is making it that small we might be able to get away we'll see let me know what you think about this but we could probably get away with making this even shorter and then having this line just be like a line across the bottom here I'm not sure I kind of I kind of want to see how it would look I'm not 100% convinced that that would be the right way to do it but I think it's worth a shot so to make that happen I'm probably going to have to change a little bit of the HTML I mean I can I can just mess with it here but if I really wanted it to work I'll have to change the structure a bit yeah so let me I was trying to just change it in Dev tools but there's too much too much that needs change so you can see how I have this now is I actually have it uh inside like a column class so um so we have it in a row and then in a column and we need to separate that out so you can see like this is the column which I've I've messed around with in Dev tools and then the row but the row is really restricting it down to this side so I can't go over so we need to completely just take it out of the row uh so we can position it however we want so I do want to keep basically I just need to keep this H1 so let's take that out and then everything within this row we get rid of and we'll just pop this in here oh man wow that that's terrible I mean we are whenever we save a commit it'll reformat this anyway but so I guess it's not a big deal also we had the I'll see if this works we might have to the text might revert to being black yeah yeah it looks like it did so let me add the class white text there we go okay so now we have it to the point where we can at least see the only problem with doing it this way is like at some point we're going to have to make even further adjustments right because it's just too big I mean maybe we could decrease the font size a bit so that we wouldn't have to worry so that would like it would never hit I mean we're close right now I just never want there to be an overlap uh over top of this image so need some adjustment at this point I'm thinking like I probably could have just completely redone this this whole section and not just tried to adjust it uh but let's at least you know do a do a little bit of adjustment here just to get a good visual of what what it could be and let's make make this shorter all right that's good for now and let's move this down okay and I definitely want to move this over okay um all right so that give us like a rough idea of where this potentially could be so I'm GNA just look at this for a second you all can check it out as well let me know what you think I mean basically we're going from from this let's break them out so we can see the side by side and we've kind of made it really I guess extreme change here you know originally so originally I wasn't thinking it would be that extreme all right so uh the delay on the video should be up so hopefully I'll be getting some feed feedback okay feedback is is it is kind of weird um okay so I'm going back now on the live chat and checking out some of the feedback okay so Matt says can make the the logo in the upper left larger and uh vertically Center it okay um Philip asks is that an image or text in the center um if you're talking about this this is actually text so You' asked that a while ago so maybe maybe you figured that out there we go okay so Justin had said you could make it make it one line okay Matt agrees on line would be better Matt also says I have to admit I don't like the react inline Styles I'm so excited to move from inline styling to CSS I can't believe we're moving back to inline and popularity yeah I know it is really weird it was really weird when I saw it at first too because that's how I don't know I mean I had everything always said like don't use inline CS but um the I I've I'm on board with it now because of the con just being having everything being modular and reusable like be if I can make my components so selfcontained to the point where I could just pull one component off of one project and pop it into another project and it would look the same and behave the same that is super valuable uh so I really like that that aspect of it especially if I could just with a few things adjust the styles to match like a new color scheme but basically everything else would be able to stay the same I think that's valuable and for me at least that helped me to get over the weirdness of it of putting the Styles you know in line okay Matt says the the logo in the upper left needs to have size increased to match the other two elements in the scope it barely registers on the screen with the other elements that's exactly what everyone was saying in the meeting yesterday so that was the the whole point of decreasing this stuff was so that this didn't get lost so yeah you're you're right on target that's what that was the General consensus yesterday John says if you use flex Direction column div inside your header within a flex div row you would have much more responsive control without playing with the margins Etc also the remm font size can tie well to responsive width okay I will now when when I am using the flex stuff though uh how back this support go for that I am using Flex in some other areas of site so I'm not super concerned about the support for it uh but I do I have noticed that like i1 just when I use flex with i1 it doesn't it doesn't look right so I don't know is anyone has experience with that I mean I'm not super worried about it there's not that many people that that even view the site with ie11 but if I if it's not too difficult to support it I would like to support it so let's work let me let me just see if I can make this bigger since we've had a few suggestions about making this bigger uh I just want to see what it would look like so let's make this a bit bigger oh actually yeah that doesn't look bad at all I don't know what what size that is uh originally but it looks good oh yeah it's definitely big enough we can make that bigger um awesome oh okay so uh i11 does have 98% support that's cool and that was uh John John just informed me about that XD saying you can use webkit prefixes okay cool yeah the the main thing that I've noticed breaks in i1 is uh when I try to vertically align things with flexbox maybe that's like the one thing that's not supported but yeah actually that that logo looks a lot better uh when it's bigger like that so I'm I'm going to bring that over and currently this the styles for that logo currently live in the style.css so this is going to be an instance where we can move that into the component so this is going to be in the nav component and let's find it's the brand logo so we can put it oops no I don't want to class I want to I want an inline style um and then I definitely want to remove this in the CSS so assuming that this does look all right and let me move I'm GNA get rid of this we don't need that right now dang it I keep clicking this accidentally um yeah that looks good let me do okay I I think that that looks all right so let's go to um we'll take a little chunk out of this giant unorganized CSS file here so it feels really good every time I get to delete something out of this file so line 208 oh man we got I forgot I had some media queries associated with it as well all right so I will have to include these so let's grab this wow I got a lot of stuff I while we're here why don't I just grab all the nav stuff and then I can just get rid of it from this file I didn't even realize I had this much all right so now the the formatting is insane like like I said this not usually how I format CSS this was just the auto uh formatting oops going to move it to our component so you have the nav component here uh I'll leave that here just for now but I am going to take that out and down below it looks like I had already transferred some stuff over here so we may have to clean it up uh I want in case I've done something here that I was overriding I'm going to put all the new styles on top so that when it Cascades um it should still all work and then I can always clean that up if there's any duplicates so the only thing that I need to change right now is this height nope not that height the uh logo height so brand logo image height needs to be 130 and now I can remove this the reason I didn't want to keep this here is because this would overwrite everything in the media queries and I need that so I'm going to save that I guess I could check quickly to make sure all right well that's nothing nothing change significantly so that's cool that works uh now let's remove all this stuff from the style styles. CSS oh yes that felt so good to get rid of that so so see I'm cutting down on it here all right I'm going to check back in the live chat quickly okay uh John said that uh his most recent site is all flex and with ie1 it's good so maybe um maybe the maybe I need to just go back and make sure that I do have the correct uh vendor prefixes and things says it looks looks so complicated yeah it I know it does um I feel like every time I go back to this file someone else uh comments about how how messy it is but it is it's true it is really messy it was never supposed to be like that um sometimes you just have to do things to get a site launched and then you clean it up later um that was the case in case you haven't seen like the whole thing and the story of this site quick recap is this was a totally unexpected project that I got assigned to like one day I was working on something and all of a sudden it was like drop everything do this project and the completion date was like it was just a really really tight deadline and um so a lot a lot of the stuff some of the stuff that's not really a great practice in the code is entire it's entirely possible that it's just because of my lack of of knowledge of the right way to do it but some of the stuff CSS included was simply because I just it just needed to get done so it was like you know what I I need this done like I'm just going to type it out and I'll have time later so there were a lot of points where it was like I'll have time later to clean this up and now is really that later so um so that's why I'm doing it now although I do appreciate everybody saying that I should clean it up so I'm not I'm not mad about it but I'm I'm just saying I I agree you don't have to convince me that it should be cleaned up um all right so what else did we want to change in here not hero um we wanted to make that The Branding text bigger where where is that I think it's here okay yeah it's here here uh so if you're not sure this outlink this is uh from a few um a few streams ago uh we made a component uh that basically fixed a bug in react GA that let us do click tracking with outbound links and open them up in a new tab so that's why this is the outlink component uh so you can check out that that video and um and the code for that if if you're interested but that's why it's not just your know a regular link tag uh so for this I think I we'll just do this in Dev tools first just to get an idea of what it's going to look like do I not have I actually don't think I even have a font size set for this this is just the default font size interesting all right so let's see this is up from it's just a a bit bigger 18 it's 18 pixels let's try to go 20 20 doesn't look too bad I do think it needs a bit more room at the top I mean it's not bad I don't want it I don't want this to be overwhelming so I think if we just move it down a bit bump it up to 20 pixels I think that'll work especially since this this is smaller now we'll probably go a bit smaller with that font I think that's decent so let me find that i' I've given this a class of uh Fus branding um so we'll just move this I I did change this to 16 and we'll add W the indentation stuff is crazy I need I had a package for Adam that was Auto indenting everything for me and it was awesome but it was messing up the um so we're using prettier and then so it was messing up stuff with prettier so that basically like it was changing the positioning in all my files and it would look like I had something to commit to get when all that had happened is my atom plugin had changed the formatting from what prettier had made it and it just kept flipping back and forth so I disabled it but now my my auto indenting is gone so I have to sort that out all right if you heard that that was my the I have an eight Monon old and that was her in the background yelling yelling for me so um okay so let's make this a bit smaller this is starting I mean this is getting to the point where I think it's close also there's just like there's a little weirdness of I've gotten used to the so used to the other one anything I do now is going to look weird at first to me so once I get over that uh I think I'll be able to look at this a bit more objectively and see whether or not it's it works uh but I think that maybe just a bit smaller on that size and then maybe move it down a little yeah and I think that'll work okay um yeah that's not too bad let me know what you think in the live chat if you haven't already oh awesome Patrick just said in the live chat uh they have a prettier atom plugin that's great I'll um I'll have to check that out oh aim high joined us hey how's it going uh aimh High say I just followed you on Twitter awesome so yeah I'll definitely um I'll check that out uh in I think the last stream or one of our recent streams uh a high said uh like told us about a job a new job so did you start yet uh or were you starting I can't remember if you said when you were going to start or not if you did start how is it all right umber to say it almost seems like there needs to be something in the space to the right of the brand to balance out the slogan but it might be weird yeah I'm with you like it it just it does look a little weird maybe if I move this in and make it bigger it'll balance a bit yeah I'll let me try that uh let me make sure I bring over the changes that I made and let see for oh okay amh high is going to start on Monday the 3 all right well good luck I hope everything is uh is awesome at your new job super excited about that oh Isaiah asks why is it better to convert the website to reactjs so um while I'm adjusting the size here I'll talk a little bit about that um reacts so react has a lot of advantages um in this case for me converting it from a static site to react uh meant that it was going to be a lot easier for me to import the data uh so on a static if so I wanted to import the data from uh from WordPress that was the plan all along the static site was like a backup plan to say okay well there's the deadlines really tight it's way faster for me to just code all this out than to either try to make a WordPress theme or make the react site that I eventually wanted to so that was just kind of the backup plan that I know I could get this out but the problem with that is if you wanted to update that static site I had to go in and update it in the code there are people there are like student work workers who work for the kakal Institute that need to be able to update it and they don't have any experience with code so I need the the content needed to come from a Content management system so with react I can easily build a component uh and those components can then uh I can render all the data into those components specifically when I'm using nextjs I can pull in the data and render it service side so then it's great for search engine optimization uh if I were to just like try to turn my static site and like do some custom you know JavaScript templates for that uh and pull that in client side I would have no search engine optimization all right uh and just so for me specifically those were a big deal but this in general react is really a nice way to do things um especially if you need like if you need things to happen on your site where there's going to be changes to the Dom instead of doing it all with jQuery which is what people I guess would normally do um react has a different way of doing things and it keeps like this alternate version of the Dom and it compares the two to only change things that need change instead of rendering everything so you end up getting better performance uh when things change on your site um the other things too like it does client side routing you know nicely so you notice like you click around on this site uh there's not page refreshes so there's just so many uh cool things that react does really well and it's not that you couldn't do it like I it's not that I couldn't have done all that stuff with a static site but it would have been really complicated for me to do it on my own and then trying for somebody else to try to keep up with that would have been insane like you know if I made my own custom routing solution and all that it uh and and I probably would have done it given the time frame I would have used uh jQuery so it would have been very hard to maintain I'm sure there's other benefits to react to that I'm just I'm forgetting or that I don't know about but I can't find in Dev tools this uh background there we go finally uh so let's move this in a bit and make it bigger and then let's move it back over a bit now just thinking if we do it like this I'll probably bring that down I was hoping that that would make it seem like there I mean there's definitely not as much space there but it still doesn't exactly look right to be honest with you if I could just lose the tagline I think it would look fine but I can't like there there's no way they'll let me take the tagline out I would actually love to get rid of the tagline because then I wouldn't have to import this font which I only import for this tagline if anyone can think of a better place to put this tagline that's still appears near the top let me know because that that I think is really what's causing the issue for us right now is that this is just kind of like odd all right so I am going to save the few things that I did here and definitely need to think about that tagline some more so I'm probably going to wrap up the video soon um definitely significant change here but I'm to a point now where I think I really just need to think about I don't know about you but when I get like I like to mess around like this but at some point like I just need to close my eyes and like picture what this is going to look like and sometimes I actually just like JW it use a pen and paper and JW it down and sometimes that's better than just continuing to make adjustments uh and I think I'm getting to that point where I need to just kind of visualize what this could be I don't think it it's not terrible but I I don't you know this is the homepage this the first thing people are going to see I wanted to look really really good uh and this just to me does not look really good so so I'm going to finish up with the actual like CSS changes here I'm going to go back to the live chat I'm going to go through and try to answer all the questions I can so if you have a question throw it in there now and then I'm going to just I'm going to wrap it up I know I said the beginning I didn't want this to be a super long video and it has ended up being a pretty long video um I really I just kind of didn't want to have this giant video that was of low low quality but I guess too late for that so I'm going to I'm going to scroll back up to the top of the live chat now and uh I'll tell you the uh the chat has gone on long enough that I have missed out on some of the stuff that was at the very top so I don't think I missed out on too much but just in case if I do miss your question uh throw it in the comments or message me on Twitter uh you say all right someone says uh indranil says hello from India hey how's it going um let's see wow someone says it's it was 135 a.m. where they were at and that was at the start of the video so thanks thanks for watching so late okay so I'm still scanning through I did stop quite a few times and go through live chat so I have answered a lot of these already uh but I'm just looking for uh for something that I I missed or maybe just didn't answer as as I could have also you if if you don't if you don't care for the Q&A session um and you're just here for the CSS stuff uh thanks so much for watching uh I'll be back I will be back next week if you want to join in usually around 2 pm eastern time uh Monday and Tuesday I will not be streaming Monday I will be at a wedding my boss is getting married so I'll be at his wedding and then Tuesday is a holiday here in the US so uh I won't be working I'll be at a a picnic at my grandfather's house so um for everybody in the US happy 4th of July for that day um so I'll be back on Wednesday though assuming I don't have some weird some meeting that time and if so then I'll just change the normal time and I'll send out a message on Twitter wow I'm I'm I'm scrolling and I'm still not seeing anything that I didn't address yet so I guess I did a decent job of watching the live chat this time uh let's see I thought I saw something but it wasn't directed to me okay here's a question I missed uh so sha Shashank Shashank Mishra says Hey Jesse I just started with JavaScript which backend language should I learn it with um I uh this this was asked a while ago so hopefully you're still tuning in um but just for anybody else that might have a similar question um as well if you're learning JavaScript you don't NE you don't actually need to learn backend language with JavaScript because you could use JavaScript on the server side as well so you could use node it depends on what you want to do though so like for instance it let's say you wanted to work with WordPress then learn PHP do you want to work with Microsoft stuff like NET Framework then learn learn c um do you want to develop I mean I do you want to end up developing for uh for mobile you know for Android uh Java or actually what's the new thing now I think it's called cotlin so you might want one of those but then again you could always just use react native and then just learn JavaScript so depending on what you want to do the answer is going to be different but if you don't have anything in particular in mind I personally would just stick with JavaScript learn that really well and learn server side so learn node uh and then you'll be good you can build entire application uh just with JavaScript um but otherwise I mean if you have the time and you want to learn something then then just you know figure out what you want to do and then pick the backend language based on that uh Dimitri says great videos helps a lot thanks Jesse awesome thank you for saying that I appreciate you watching too um Joshua says what do you like to use for accepting credit card payments with react actually I've never done an ecommerce site with react uh I have done a couple that were just like straight up WordPress sites uh I've used um I think I've used stripe obviously PayPal everybody's use PayPal before and I use um authorized.net so those are I think the three that I've worked with of the three the hardest to work was probably authorize.net stripe is super simple to work with PayPal is pretty simple as well so uh it might just come down to uh the rates really uh or if you're doing it because and this of course like I said I haven't done it with react so I don't know if any of those would be harder to work with in react but at least for what I had to do with them in WordPress which to be honest was mostly plugin based so it's not like I was hardcoding like PHP or anything so uh but I found stripe and PayPal to be the easiest and this was this was a few years ago the last time I had to do an ecommerce site so uh you just keep that in mind when you consider my answer and Ahmed said oh okay Ahmed was having a like a side discussion with someone else so I'll skip that um let see oh James wait back an hour ago James said uh ask what's happening actually I think I did see that I think I I addressed that question so for a second I felt really bad uh because James James says hey I'm a Noob here what's happening so I really really especially like to answer people who are new answer their questions um so that you know they feel welcome right off the bat um XD said we have a nerds meeting here I didn't see that the first time but quiet okay looks like there's a decent conversation going on about react native so uh the video is already really long I'm not going to read everything out but that was awesome uh if if you if you're watching the recording and you haven't got a chance to join in live I definitely like recommend it if if you ever get a chance because there's so many very knowledgeable people in the live chat that provide so much help if you ask a question um they're just really great it's kind of a nice little Community uh that's developed in the live chat and they're they're super helpful and and super nice so uh join in if if you can uh Joshua ask have you had any success with stripe in react okay this is so as as I said earlier I have not done any ecommerce with reacts not yet okay Patrick asks uh what npm module lets you use class instead of class name uh let me let me check really quick because where was that I had brought up contributors I know it was in a was it Dan I think it was Danny that contributed that um let me see I was hoping it would link right to that here can I see it here uh I guess not I guess I'll just check my package Json um I don't remember offand but I'm sure if I see it I'll I'll remember right away so let's check in here oh here we go Babble plugin react HTML attribute to ATS so I don't if you could see that one that's the one and then I think there was some configuration maybe in this Babel RC yeah so I had to add this in and conf as well I didn't add this in uh Patrick added I'm pretty sure not Patrick uh Danny added this in uh I'm pretty sure that was the the pull request from from Danny so um anyway but it's really help ful so thanks for that that pool request um and that's the uh that's the module and I'm pretty sure it does work um it's not just for class it's for the other the other attributes as well so um I'm going to get spoiled by it and then work on a project where I don't have it and then mess it up but it's really cool for now okay cool it looks like um pretty much everybody was saying that the resolution was fine so that's good to know uh maybe I finally got the right settings here and I can actually stream from home so uh I'll do I'm going to check out the video later on and and play it back and just kind of see what the quality was uh but if if it's decent then maybe I am I will be able to stream from home so I that's really good because then it doesn't really matter the only thing that was bothering me about not being able to go in to work uh to do my work was just not being able to stream so if I can do it from home then then it can take their time and block GitHub for as long as they want and I I'll enjoy working from home someone who's uh I I can't read this name because it's it's not in like nor my normal alphabet it says says what the hell in here so I was not sure you know what I bet that this person joined in right when I had my style.css file open so that was the appropriate response so okay looks like I'm seeing like a a few different um comments of just kind of adjusting things uh so I'm going to save I'm going to look over that later uh when I finish up these adjustments but uh I'm going to skip over it for now so I can make sure I get to everybody's questions man I'm I I was just getting hammered today with all the the comments I'm I'm never showing my style.css file on a stream again this is like Patrick says I've never seen a mini map with a scroll bar before uh so I'm just messing around you guys are you're fine I I can take it and I agree with you XD says I prefer to be refactoring while coding so yeah uh this was in response I think when I was talking about saying I just kept putting off actually you know organizing everything the way it should be I I really do too like I like to refactor like immediately after I get it working and everything and then refactor but these are these are all all things that are best practices that you get you all are mentioning and uh so uh I did not follow those for this project okay some some people were asking about the um oh let me go back to here this image so it's actually uh this is called a monstr so uh m o n s r a n c a monstr so I I guess it sounded like I was saying monster so yeah so it's actually a monstr so I had a few questions about that in the live chat so uh this is in the middle here is what's called uh the Eucharist so I mean this is like in terms of Catholicism this is like the most important thing um uh about like the entire worship like if you ever been to to a Catholic like worship ceremony it's called a mass and this is like the Highlight so anyway I mean I don't I don't want to go into a big uh discussion here because this is a coding thing but basically just know that these monstrances are supposed to be like very beautiful because it holds something very important so uh that's what this is a pict picture of so in terms of The catechetical Institute Their audience for this are going to be um people who work within the Catholic church so they're going to like immediately when they see this it's going to be a very powerful image for them uh so that's why we wanted to include it right here and it was important but yes but it's not it's not monster it is a monstrance um and to be honest with you the word is probably came from Latin and I know quite a bit of Latin but I right now I I can't tell you what that word originally came from uh but anyway uh let's see okay so we have some comments about the the tagline and things so um okay so we're asking about like potentially could we make this um smaller and then put this tagline under it I'd actually I was kind of thinking about that but um do I I think that we want to keep it bigger but it may if I can't think of anything else that may be something we go to is to just have this as a very small kind of image in the top and have this under well off to try it out but I'm pretty sure that this looks better when it's bigger but we'll see there's definitely room for uh kind of you know messing around with it I guess um Al Allan says bless you so I don't know I don't I guess that was directed to me so thank you um Isaiah says how do you come up with designs for your website um basically so I start off everything the basis for all the designs are is uh material design so Google's uh design framework is called material design if you haven't checked it out just type in into a Google search the first thing that comes up most likely will be Google's documentation on material design um really nice I I really like it the more I the more I learn about it and get into it the more I appreciate it so um That's the basis for my design I'd like I like it because it's a pretty standard thing it's used for a lot of sites so from a user's perspective the design patterns will be familiar the way the UI Works will be familiar so I like that if a user comes to one of my sites they'll see things that they've most likely seen on other sites or apps uh so it just I don't know I think it just makes things a little bit more comfortable for the user for me it gives me the benefit of not having to make every single decision about the design so I start from there and then I adapt based on what the needs are so you know whatever whatever the client or whoever from that I'm working with uh whatever they need sometimes I do have to adapt things uh to accommodate that or sometimes they have very distinct like preferences for style that I try to blend as best I can with material design principles so not every single thing on the site will follow material design spec exactly because occasionally I I I need to kind of be a little bit flexible to be able to try to blend the style that the client wants with that uh but for the most part I do try to follow material design Styles and then when I'm actually thinking about design stuff sometimes like I just throw it on there and just move it around see how it works I like to draw things out on paper I'm a terrible terrible artist when it comes to drawing but I can at least get like a visual of where things are laid out so I wouldn't consider myself a designer but I do have to do design work uh so that's kind of like my my process for uh for design and it's uh it's I've never undergone any like formal training for design or anything so I'm I'm sure that there are more efficient ways of doing that uh but this is just what I've kind of developed out of necessity of having to do this um oh uh sudu I'm not sure how to pronounce that sorry if I mispronounced your name ask can you please suggest some tutorial for Python and D Jango I don't know about D Jango but uh for python Udacity um intro to CSS course is done all in Python and uh I like that course so that might be something that uh you might want to check into and then supplement that with something that's more Django specific as well Alexandre says hello hey how's it going Matt says the Django website actually has a really good intro tutorial Cool J j503 Cool says it kind of looks like an old school WordPress design honestly I'm not going to lie the header to me especially when I've shrunk it like this does look more old school than so like the the header as it currently is um this does not look like an old school design but this is starting to look more like an old school design I didn't realize it until you said it but as soon as I saw that comment I totally agree and now I feel terrible about it I guess there's yeah now I I like it so much less now that you said that we'll see maybe I'll have to think about it even more but I mean at the end of the day like I um I just need to include these El basically every element that's in here right now has to be in there somewhere so I have to include them all I can do some rearranging of things but as long as they're all in in there it should be okay so I guess we have some room if if anyone has any other suggestions as long as everything's included it might actually work so uh let me know um but yeah I'll have to think about that this ended up being more difficult than I'd anticipated hopefully the end result is worth it though uh I might do an alternate version where the change is less drastic where maybe I I just shrink it everything slightly if I can't get this one to work and then maybe it'll work it'll work better like that but um anyway I uh I think that's it for today and uh yeah we've definitely dropped below our normal amount of viewers at this point so um thank you for watching and I will I won't be back for a while so next Wednesday will probably be the next time I do a stream so um have a great weekend everyone and uh if you're in in the United States uh have a great holiday uh next week and uh let me know if you have any questions I'm I'm available to answer anything on Twitter or any other Social Media stuff and uh thank you so much uh for uh for watching today
