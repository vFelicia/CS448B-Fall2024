00:00 - javascript has three kinds of pop-up
00:02 - boxes
00:04 - alert box confirm box and prompt box
00:07 - many people think you should almost
00:09 - never use this feature of javascript
00:12 - preferring custom modals instead
00:14 - the reason for this is because they're
00:16 - very obtrusive they lock the entire
00:18 - browser and will take focus even if
00:20 - initiated by an inactive tab
00:23 - but there are still occasionally good
00:24 - reasons to use them so it's they're good
00:26 - to know about
00:27 - so for instance right now we have the
00:29 - alert here so if i run this
00:31 - it's going to pop up i am an alert box
00:34 - right here now you cannot choose where
00:36 - the pop-up box is going to be that's up
00:39 - to the browser that's another reason why
00:41 - custom modals are often better because
00:43 - you have more choice of where it's going
00:44 - to appear in the browser so these alert
00:47 - boxes are just to give a message and
00:50 - then you hit ok to make the message go
00:52 - away one example is if you want to give
00:54 - a message that a person is just about to
00:56 - be automatically logged out of a website
00:59 - okay let's comment this out and we're
01:01 - going to put another one here now i'm
01:03 - going to show you the confirm box so
01:05 - this is the code for the confirm box
01:08 - you're going to put the word confirm and
01:10 - then you're going to put what you want
01:11 - to be confirmed and this is going to
01:14 - return a
01:15 - a boolean
01:16 - so if if you if we run this to see what
01:18 - it looks like
01:20 - so we can now either push cancel or ok
01:24 - if we put ok it will return true if we
01:27 - put cancel it will return false so if i
01:29 - click ok you'll see in the console you
01:32 - pressed ok that comes from this right
01:34 - here or if i run this again
01:36 - and press cancel and the console say you
01:39 - you press cancel
01:41 - and just you know alert and confirm
01:44 - these are all part of the window object
01:47 - so you could write it like this
01:49 - window.confirm or window.alert that's
01:52 - implied if i run this it will do the
01:54 - exact same thing
01:56 - but the window is just implied when you
01:58 - use alert or confirm
02:00 - okay and the last one is the prompt
02:03 - let me
02:04 - comment this out for prompt you can pass
02:06 - in two things the first is the message
02:08 - that's going to show and the second
02:10 - thing is the default text in the text
02:13 - box
02:14 - let me run this and so you can see what
02:15 - i mean so in prompt you can actually put
02:18 - in a piece of information here and then
02:21 - it will return that piece of information
02:24 - so you can see in this code it's person
02:26 - is going to equal and it's going to set
02:29 - the the variable person to equal
02:30 - whatever we put in here so if we put we
02:33 - can change this name
02:35 - and then if i hit okay
02:38 - you can see in the the con the
02:39 - console.log hello quincy how are you
02:42 - today and we just get it from here this
02:44 - if person equals null or person equals
02:47 - nothing then we're going to put user
02:49 - cancel the prompt
02:51 - else we're gonna say hello and we're
02:53 - gonna bring in the person's name that we
02:54 - used and then how are you today so if i
02:57 - run that again
02:59 - and hit cancel it's gonna say user
03:01 - canceled the prompt okay that's pop-up
03:04 - boxes
