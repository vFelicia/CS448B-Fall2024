00:00 - hey everybody welcome back to css3 in 30
00:02 - days today's day number 26 and we're
00:04 - going to be building something really
00:05 - exciting but first of all you might
00:07 - notice that my microphone is in a really
00:08 - weird
00:09 - position
00:10 - i realize with this road extendable boom
00:13 - arm
00:15 - that you can mount to your desk it's
00:16 - really versatile it's quite nice
00:19 - uh but this whole time i've been hanging
00:21 - it
00:22 - in front of my face which means i can't
00:23 - actually see my screen that well which
00:25 - makes it a little bit difficult to
00:26 - record coding tutorials so i maneuvered
00:30 - it in this really unusual awkward
00:32 - looking position
00:37 - and i thought hey i'll give it a try for
00:39 - this round so here we go
00:41 - over here in my browser
00:44 - still adjusting this thing
00:47 - not going to promise we're keeping it
00:48 - this way folks
00:49 - all right
00:51 - we have got the day 26 3d layers and
00:54 - what am i talking about when i say 3d
00:55 - layers well
00:56 - let me show you here to you right now
00:58 - this might look like a just like a
01:00 - normal
01:02 - the normal mock-up
01:04 - but the fact is that i created it in
01:05 - photoshop using
01:07 - svg
01:08 - format which means it's a vector format
01:10 - which means it's infinitely scalable and
01:12 - super sharp regardless of your screen
01:13 - size
01:14 - and if you make it bigger or smaller so
01:16 - i created this mock-up i included the
01:18 - photoshop document in the image folder
01:20 - as well so maybe you might want to see
01:22 - and play around with it
01:24 - but this is what happens when i hover
01:26 - over this mock-up watch this
01:31 - that's super cool so you might already
01:34 - think that's amazing i want to know how
01:36 - to make that or you might think i have
01:37 - some ideas on how i want to use that
01:39 - essentially the reason why we're doing
01:41 - this is one it's a really big challenge
01:43 - that we're doing a lot of really
01:44 - interesting maneuvering using uh
01:46 - different
01:48 - different planes the x y and z planes
01:49 - using transitions transforms and
01:51 - animations and all that sort of thing so
01:53 - it's a challenging little task it's a
01:55 - super impressive way to display almost
01:57 - anything in a showcase format on your
02:00 - website so a mock-up a blueprint a
02:03 - wireframe even images or you know
02:06 - different elements it's really exciting
02:08 - now i wouldn't use it as a functional
02:10 - piece like for navigating or something
02:12 - like that
02:13 - but to display something in an
02:14 - impressive manner to show the layers of
02:16 - your work or something like that this is
02:19 - the way to do it
02:20 - now
02:21 - let's look at it one more time
02:23 - show you what's happening so we have a
02:24 - back layer here
02:26 - and then we have a middle layer right
02:28 - here
02:30 - a top layer these three these six
02:32 - circles
02:33 - and this text down here this uh
02:37 - mock-up text wireframe text just a bunch
02:39 - of lines that mimics text
02:41 - and then we have the
02:43 - uh these two icons here on the tippy top
02:46 - i call it and so in one
02:49 - layer just looking at it straight it
02:50 - looks like a normal mock-up but when you
02:52 - hover over it it
02:54 - extends out and shifts it changes and
02:57 - it's using a 3d transformation in css3
03:00 - so why don't we jump in and get started
03:03 - over here in the code editor we have the
03:06 - day 26 3d layers i have all of the
03:09 - assets there index sandbox vinyl and the
03:11 - image folder which includes
03:13 - svg files which are not image files
03:15 - technically they're actually sdg files
03:17 - which stands for scalable vector graphic
03:20 - so it's not an image but you can add it
03:22 - to your websites and web pages using the
03:25 - image tag so it it sees it as an image
03:28 - but the file actually isn't a technical
03:30 - true image
03:32 - and then i have the layers.psd there if
03:34 - you want to open it up in photoshop and
03:35 - check it out play around with it and do
03:37 - whatever so here's the markup right here
03:39 - in a div with the class of layers i have
03:42 - four image tags in there there they are
03:45 - commented out because
03:46 - you will see once i uncomment it it
03:48 - creates a really uh there's the really
03:50 - large
03:51 - vector graphics that take up most of the
03:54 - page you have to scroll down so for
03:56 - visualization purposes showing you the
03:58 - demo i didn't want you to see that so
03:59 - now go ahead and uncomment that
04:02 - and then you will have your
04:04 - four images
04:06 - scalable vector graphics now if you
04:07 - check it on the browser it's going to
04:09 - look really bad
04:10 - massive files like this but we're going
04:13 - to be using this and manipulating these
04:15 - in css to make them work okay so now
04:18 - that we've got those svg images svg
04:21 - graphics in there what we're going to do
04:23 - is head over to our sandbox and we're
04:24 - going to get started with our coding
04:27 - adventure for this 3d layer effect let's
04:29 - start off by selecting layers
04:31 - and then we're going to tell it position
04:35 - relative
04:37 - a minimum height
04:38 - of now it's going to be a specific
04:40 - number i'm going to say 6 640
04:42 - pixels
04:43 - and that's simply because the vector
04:46 - graphic here if i were to open it
04:49 - you can see here the width and the
04:50 - height
04:51 - are this
04:52 - by default that's really large so i'm
04:54 - going to scale that down to
04:56 - about one-third of the size now it's a
04:59 - rough calculation but i basically took
05:00 - these and divided them by three and
05:02 - that's essentially the numbers we're
05:03 - using i rounded it up a little bit just
05:05 - so that they were easy numbers
05:07 - to calculate
05:09 - max width is going to be 360. so now
05:11 - we're going to have the proper ratio in
05:13 - this parent layer and now next what
05:15 - we're going to do is we're going to say
05:16 - layers and then select the image tags
05:18 - we're going to say position absolute
05:20 - because we're going to be moving them
05:21 - all around max width is going to be 100
05:24 - so it's going to it's going to fill out
05:27 - the content the parent the parent
05:29 - container and now we're going to say
05:30 - height is 100
05:32 - it's going to fill out that parent
05:33 - container
05:34 - uh
05:36 - height wise as well lengthwise
05:39 - vertical wise whatever
05:42 - transition we're gonna say all e's
05:44 - sixteen hundred milliseconds
05:47 - and that's important because we're going
05:48 - to be doing a transition to give us that
05:50 - animated effect now we're going to say
05:52 - transform
05:54 - style and we're going to say preserve 3d
05:57 - because we're going to have the
05:59 - transform we're going to do some uh
06:01 - transforming and some
06:03 - shifting and perspective you know 3d
06:07 - animations and
06:08 - maneuvering and this preserves that 3d
06:12 - plane because we want it to actually
06:13 - look three-dimensional not like it's
06:15 - skewed
06:17 - so preserve 3d
06:19 - so we're going to save that and now if
06:22 - you check it out in your browser you'll
06:23 - see that now we have a more reasonable
06:24 - size problem here is that all the layers
06:27 - are all messed up and that's because all
06:29 - these svg graphics are the same width
06:31 - and same height and svg graphics don't
06:33 - really perform the same way as a png
06:37 - bitmap graphic for example which only
06:39 - takes up the size of space so for
06:41 - example this as a png would only take up
06:44 - this much space but it actually
06:46 - is taking up this much space the entire
06:48 - container because of the height
06:51 - uh and it's just it's a thing that you
06:52 - have to work with with svg files it's
06:54 - kind of unusual maybe there's a way
06:56 - around it i'm not entirely experienced
06:58 - with playing with svgs
07:00 - but for this purposes of this tutorial
07:02 - this is how we're gonna do it
07:04 - so now we gotta maneuver all these
07:05 - things using positions quite easy but it
07:07 - takes a little bit of it took me a
07:09 - little bit of playing around and
07:11 - maneuvering it using uh pixels and
07:13 - everything like that uh but i finally
07:15 - came to some final numbers so let's type
07:18 - those in right now
07:19 - so what we're going to do
07:21 - is say layers
07:23 - image of the class of mid
07:25 - because that we have each of the layers
07:27 - the images with the class of back mid
07:30 - top and tippy top so we can do this with
07:32 - them i'm going to say the width of the
07:35 - mid layer which is the
07:36 - not the background layer but the one
07:38 - just in front of it
07:40 - is 320 pixels and that's because we have
07:44 - a max width of 360. so it's the
07:46 - background is 360. i want this next one
07:48 - to be 320 and then i'm going to shift it
07:50 - over this allows me to do some
07:52 - mock margins so to speak
07:54 - so we're going to say
07:56 - 320 which will look something like this
07:58 - you can see now it's smaller in the
08:00 - background right here now i'm going to
08:02 - shift it over 20 pixels
08:04 - so that should give us an exact 20 and
08:06 - 20 on either side because it's apparent
08:08 - just 360. so 320 plus 40 is 360.
08:13 - so basic math
08:14 - now we're going to say layers image of
08:16 - the class of top
08:18 - and we're going to give that one a width
08:19 - of 300 pixels
08:21 - so now i'm taking off
08:23 - 20 pixels
08:25 - in total
08:27 - from that
08:29 - from the top layer which is this one
08:30 - here as you can see this one with the
08:32 - logo and then the navigation so now i
08:34 - want to shift that in
08:36 - about
08:38 - 30 pixels because it's going to be 10
08:40 - pixels on either side as you can see
08:41 - here that's looking a little bit better
08:44 - but the top is off i don't like how the
08:46 - top looks so now i'm going to say top if
08:48 - i said 0
08:51 - it would look like this that's because
08:53 - the top is at zero but i want to move it
08:55 - up just about five pixels so top
08:57 - negative five pixels and that looks like
09:00 - that that looks much better now we have
09:01 - this tippy top layer which are these uh
09:03 - this film reel and the bicycle
09:06 - layers
09:07 - image and then tippy is what i called it
09:10 - with 280 pixels so i'm taking off
09:12 - another 20 pixels
09:15 - i'm gonna say left 40 pixels
09:20 - and that'll look a little bit better
09:22 - uh but now i want to say top and i want
09:24 - to bring it up negative 150 pixels that
09:27 - should bring me up to where i want it so
09:29 - now our mock-up is looking much more
09:31 - reasonable
09:32 - now what we have to do is
09:34 - play with it so this is the fun part
09:37 - so
09:38 - we're going to create a style rule that
09:42 - says layers
09:43 - upon hover
09:45 - the images so we're going to start off
09:47 - with transform
09:50 - now what i'm going to do is i'm going to
09:51 - take hover off for now because i want to
09:53 - see it while i'm deving versus
09:56 - having to hover over every single time
09:58 - to see my work so i'm just going to say
09:59 - layers image for now
10:03 - now
10:04 - this is where all the fun comes in
10:05 - there's a lot of different values and
10:08 - functions actually you can add to the
10:10 - transform property so by function i
10:12 - literally mean something like using
10:14 - rotate x this is a css function
10:18 - uh as a as a value for this
10:21 - property
10:22 - so rotate x this will rotate the image
10:25 - or all the images on the x plane so i
10:28 - want to rotate it 50 degrees feel free
10:30 - to play around with this in all the ways
10:31 - that you want but you can see here now
10:33 - that something weird has happened
10:36 - um
10:37 - it's shifted
10:39 - on an angle like if you're looking at
10:40 - something it's shifted
10:42 - like this
10:43 - and so that's what happened here now it
10:44 - doesn't look 3d because
10:47 - there is one function that we have to
10:48 - add but i want to add it at the end so
10:50 - you can see the dramatic change
10:53 - so now i want to rotate
10:54 - on the y plane
10:57 - 20 degrees let's see what happens there
11:00 - we go so now we've
11:01 - the y plane is this one so the x plane
11:03 - is this one the y plane is this one
11:08 - and now we're going to say rotate
11:10 - on the z plane
11:12 - negative 25 degrees let's see what
11:14 - happens
11:15 - okay so now we've shifted it
11:18 - on this unusual angle
11:21 - as if it's coming
11:22 - if it's going back this way and towards
11:24 - us this way so on this like um
11:28 - z plane i suppose if you play around
11:30 - with it you'll start to see how it's
11:32 - moving in digital space
11:34 - now like i said this doesn't look
11:37 - right
11:38 - it doesn't look very three-dimensional
11:40 - versus this down here you can see that
11:42 - looks very three-dimensional like it's
11:44 - coming off your screen and towards you
11:46 - well that's because we need to add
11:48 - an additional function in here called
11:50 - perspective
11:52 - now the perspective
11:53 - property or function
11:55 - in this case
11:57 - creates or enables 3d
11:59 - space
12:01 - on your screen and produces this
12:03 - illusion of a distance between the z
12:06 - plane and myself the person viewing the
12:08 - screen
12:09 - so
12:10 - now what's going to happen
12:12 - is if i say perspective and then
12:15 - let's go 1000 pixels now what's going to
12:18 - happen here i'll tell explain how this
12:20 - value the numeric value works but let's
12:21 - see what it looks like first
12:23 - so now
12:24 - it looks three-dimensional it actually
12:26 - has the proper
12:28 - the proper shape the back looks smaller
12:30 - than the front it's it looks like it's
12:31 - coming towards us a little bit
12:33 - what if i change this to like 600.
12:36 - now you can see he's way more
12:38 - um exaggerated that three-dimensional
12:41 - effect
12:42 - so the smaller this value the more
12:45 - exaggerated effect because that's that
12:47 - means that you are closer to this
12:50 - element on the z-plane so you're looking
12:51 - at something closer as if i were looking
12:53 - at my phone like this
12:55 - the back side looks smaller than the
12:57 - front side it's got this dramatic effect
12:59 - whereas if i was like this
13:01 - further away
13:03 - it's much less exaggerated versus
13:06 - that so hopefully that makes sense
13:09 - okay so i'm going to go back to i'm
13:11 - going to say 1200 so it's it's there
13:13 - it's it's 3d but it's not crazy
13:16 - exaggerated now as you can see it's way
13:18 - down here
13:19 - it's not in the right space it looks
13:20 - kind of sloppy especially if i hovered
13:22 - it it would fall down the page would
13:24 - look really weird so we're going to
13:26 - remedy that with translate so we're
13:28 - going to translate on the x
13:31 - axis 35 pixels this is simply like doing
13:34 - uh positioning but in 3d space
13:37 - so translate 35 pixels that's going to
13:39 - move it to the left
13:41 - translate
13:44 - on the y-axis
13:46 - and we're going to say zero pixels we
13:48 - don't want it that's up and down
13:50 - and then translate on the z axis
13:54 - and that will bring us back up to the
13:57 - space where i want it so now we're
14:00 - looking a lot better so if i were to say
14:01 - layers
14:02 - hover now layers hover image save that
14:05 - let's see what that looks like i hover
14:07 - it shifts
14:08 - and transitions there it looks pretty
14:11 - good and that's because we did the
14:12 - transition
14:14 - property up here if i were to take that
14:16 - out
14:17 - this would be a lot less nice
14:20 - as you can see
14:22 - it's that transition that shows us we're
14:24 - going into three-dimensional space
14:26 - so
14:28 - now what i want to do is position these
14:31 - in the proper i want them to to expand
14:34 - out i want it to like give us that well
14:36 - that effect down here
14:38 - where it all kind of layers out that's
14:40 - nice so we want to do that so we're
14:42 - going to achieve that by individually
14:44 - styling each image or each layer so i'm
14:47 - going to say layers hover
14:50 - image of the class of mid
14:52 - and i'm going to go ahead and copy this
14:54 - entire thing
14:55 - paste it
14:56 - and change a couple of the values now i
14:59 - can i probably could take out the values
15:01 - that i don't need like maybe if i just
15:02 - took out all of these
15:04 - and left translate z
15:06 - translate zed
15:08 - for us canadians
15:10 - and i'm going to change that to 240
15:12 - pixels let's see if just having one
15:14 - value there works
15:17 - it doesn't the reason why is because now
15:19 - i'm saying that transform is not present
15:22 - for all the other x y and z planes so i
15:25 - have to leave it in
15:27 - all of these values
15:29 - translate z i'm going to change back to
15:31 - 240
15:33 - check it out when i hover
15:35 - you see that layer is now lifted off of
15:37 - the
15:38 - background copy this now the rest is
15:41 - super easy paste that whole thing out
15:43 - image
15:44 - top
15:45 - we're going to change the value of the
15:47 - last one to 80. so that's going to be
15:49 - 280 pixels further on the z plane and
15:52 - i'm going to refresh and hover
15:54 - now we've got our second layer
15:57 - like that
15:58 - last but not least copy that
16:01 - paste it out and now we're going to do
16:02 - the tipi class
16:05 - and that translate z
16:06 - it's going to be as you can see in here
16:08 - it's unusual the way that this floats in
16:11 - space is because it's a different
16:13 - proportions than these other elements so
16:15 - we have to use different values to move
16:18 - it in the right uh in the right place
16:21 - so you might think 240 280 this one's
16:23 - obviously going to be 320 but that would
16:26 - really mess things up as you'll see here
16:29 - it's just really too far and so there's
16:32 - something about the size of this svg
16:34 - that just means we have to change that
16:36 - value so it's actually 260. i'm not
16:39 - entirely sure why if i really looked
16:41 - into it i'd figure it out
16:42 - and maybe you have an idea but
16:44 - this gives us the right effect
16:47 - so now they're all about the same
16:49 - distance from each other in that in
16:52 - space in 3d space
16:54 - and really that is it for our 3d layer
16:58 - effect now here's a challenge for you
17:00 - feel free to
17:02 - maneuver this in whatever way you want
17:05 - the thing is these this is a little bit
17:07 - tricky and finicky if you're looking for
17:08 - a responsive effect right now i've
17:10 - hard-coded the width so that we don't
17:12 - really have uh any issues but even in
17:15 - the background here the background is a
17:16 - 100
17:17 - you could see things are looking a
17:19 - little bit different here
17:21 - the other thing is when you hover
17:23 - over this
17:24 - layer these layers come out and then
17:26 - hover again at any point in that
17:28 - transition it it does like a weird as
17:31 - you could see like it kind of
17:33 - starts the animation from where you
17:35 - clicked on it or where you hovered so it
17:36 - really messes with it and it's really
17:38 - unusual so you'd have to do this in the
17:40 - right controlled space and uh really
17:43 - play around with it to make sure you're
17:44 - doing the right thing so you don't have
17:45 - a really wonky looking animation
17:48 - this is really for demo purposes to show
17:50 - you what you can do with 3d space
17:52 - rotates translates transforms and
17:54 - everything like that i hope today's
17:56 - lesson was valuable educational and fun
17:58 - for you thanks for hanging out for day
18:00 - 26 tomorrow we're closing in on the last
18:03 - few days here and i'll see you in day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome back to css3 in 30 days today's day number 26 and we're going to be building something really exciting but first of all you might notice that my microphone is in a really weird position i realize with this road extendable boom arm that you can mount to your desk it's really versatile it's quite nice uh but this whole time i've been hanging it in front of my face which means i can't actually see my screen that well which makes it a little bit difficult to record coding tutorials so i maneuvered it in this really unusual awkward looking position and i thought hey i'll give it a try for this round so here we go over here in my browser still adjusting this thing not going to promise we're keeping it this way folks all right we have got the day 26 3d layers and what am i talking about when i say 3d layers well let me show you here to you right now this might look like a just like a normal the normal mockup but the fact is that i created it in photoshop using svg format which means it's a vector format which means it's infinitely scalable and super sharp regardless of your screen size and if you make it bigger or smaller so i created this mockup i included the photoshop document in the image folder as well so maybe you might want to see and play around with it but this is what happens when i hover over this mockup watch this that's super cool so you might already think that's amazing i want to know how to make that or you might think i have some ideas on how i want to use that essentially the reason why we're doing this is one it's a really big challenge that we're doing a lot of really interesting maneuvering using uh different different planes the x y and z planes using transitions transforms and animations and all that sort of thing so it's a challenging little task it's a super impressive way to display almost anything in a showcase format on your website so a mockup a blueprint a wireframe even images or you know different elements it's really exciting now i wouldn't use it as a functional piece like for navigating or something like that but to display something in an impressive manner to show the layers of your work or something like that this is the way to do it now let's look at it one more time show you what's happening so we have a back layer here and then we have a middle layer right here a top layer these three these six circles and this text down here this uh mockup text wireframe text just a bunch of lines that mimics text and then we have the uh these two icons here on the tippy top i call it and so in one layer just looking at it straight it looks like a normal mockup but when you hover over it it extends out and shifts it changes and it's using a 3d transformation in css3 so why don't we jump in and get started over here in the code editor we have the day 26 3d layers i have all of the assets there index sandbox vinyl and the image folder which includes svg files which are not image files technically they're actually sdg files which stands for scalable vector graphic so it's not an image but you can add it to your websites and web pages using the image tag so it it sees it as an image but the file actually isn't a technical true image and then i have the layers.psd there if you want to open it up in photoshop and check it out play around with it and do whatever so here's the markup right here in a div with the class of layers i have four image tags in there there they are commented out because you will see once i uncomment it it creates a really uh there's the really large vector graphics that take up most of the page you have to scroll down so for visualization purposes showing you the demo i didn't want you to see that so now go ahead and uncomment that and then you will have your four images scalable vector graphics now if you check it on the browser it's going to look really bad massive files like this but we're going to be using this and manipulating these in css to make them work okay so now that we've got those svg images svg graphics in there what we're going to do is head over to our sandbox and we're going to get started with our coding adventure for this 3d layer effect let's start off by selecting layers and then we're going to tell it position relative a minimum height of now it's going to be a specific number i'm going to say 6 640 pixels and that's simply because the vector graphic here if i were to open it you can see here the width and the height are this by default that's really large so i'm going to scale that down to about onethird of the size now it's a rough calculation but i basically took these and divided them by three and that's essentially the numbers we're using i rounded it up a little bit just so that they were easy numbers to calculate max width is going to be 360. so now we're going to have the proper ratio in this parent layer and now next what we're going to do is we're going to say layers and then select the image tags we're going to say position absolute because we're going to be moving them all around max width is going to be 100 so it's going to it's going to fill out the content the parent the parent container and now we're going to say height is 100 it's going to fill out that parent container uh height wise as well lengthwise vertical wise whatever transition we're gonna say all e's sixteen hundred milliseconds and that's important because we're going to be doing a transition to give us that animated effect now we're going to say transform style and we're going to say preserve 3d because we're going to have the transform we're going to do some uh transforming and some shifting and perspective you know 3d animations and maneuvering and this preserves that 3d plane because we want it to actually look threedimensional not like it's skewed so preserve 3d so we're going to save that and now if you check it out in your browser you'll see that now we have a more reasonable size problem here is that all the layers are all messed up and that's because all these svg graphics are the same width and same height and svg graphics don't really perform the same way as a png bitmap graphic for example which only takes up the size of space so for example this as a png would only take up this much space but it actually is taking up this much space the entire container because of the height uh and it's just it's a thing that you have to work with with svg files it's kind of unusual maybe there's a way around it i'm not entirely experienced with playing with svgs but for this purposes of this tutorial this is how we're gonna do it so now we gotta maneuver all these things using positions quite easy but it takes a little bit of it took me a little bit of playing around and maneuvering it using uh pixels and everything like that uh but i finally came to some final numbers so let's type those in right now so what we're going to do is say layers image of the class of mid because that we have each of the layers the images with the class of back mid top and tippy top so we can do this with them i'm going to say the width of the mid layer which is the not the background layer but the one just in front of it is 320 pixels and that's because we have a max width of 360. so it's the background is 360. i want this next one to be 320 and then i'm going to shift it over this allows me to do some mock margins so to speak so we're going to say 320 which will look something like this you can see now it's smaller in the background right here now i'm going to shift it over 20 pixels so that should give us an exact 20 and 20 on either side because it's apparent just 360. so 320 plus 40 is 360. so basic math now we're going to say layers image of the class of top and we're going to give that one a width of 300 pixels so now i'm taking off 20 pixels in total from that from the top layer which is this one here as you can see this one with the logo and then the navigation so now i want to shift that in about 30 pixels because it's going to be 10 pixels on either side as you can see here that's looking a little bit better but the top is off i don't like how the top looks so now i'm going to say top if i said 0 it would look like this that's because the top is at zero but i want to move it up just about five pixels so top negative five pixels and that looks like that that looks much better now we have this tippy top layer which are these uh this film reel and the bicycle layers image and then tippy is what i called it with 280 pixels so i'm taking off another 20 pixels i'm gonna say left 40 pixels and that'll look a little bit better uh but now i want to say top and i want to bring it up negative 150 pixels that should bring me up to where i want it so now our mockup is looking much more reasonable now what we have to do is play with it so this is the fun part so we're going to create a style rule that says layers upon hover the images so we're going to start off with transform now what i'm going to do is i'm going to take hover off for now because i want to see it while i'm deving versus having to hover over every single time to see my work so i'm just going to say layers image for now now this is where all the fun comes in there's a lot of different values and functions actually you can add to the transform property so by function i literally mean something like using rotate x this is a css function uh as a as a value for this property so rotate x this will rotate the image or all the images on the x plane so i want to rotate it 50 degrees feel free to play around with this in all the ways that you want but you can see here now that something weird has happened um it's shifted on an angle like if you're looking at something it's shifted like this and so that's what happened here now it doesn't look 3d because there is one function that we have to add but i want to add it at the end so you can see the dramatic change so now i want to rotate on the y plane 20 degrees let's see what happens there we go so now we've the y plane is this one so the x plane is this one the y plane is this one and now we're going to say rotate on the z plane negative 25 degrees let's see what happens okay so now we've shifted it on this unusual angle as if it's coming if it's going back this way and towards us this way so on this like um z plane i suppose if you play around with it you'll start to see how it's moving in digital space now like i said this doesn't look right it doesn't look very threedimensional versus this down here you can see that looks very threedimensional like it's coming off your screen and towards you well that's because we need to add an additional function in here called perspective now the perspective property or function in this case creates or enables 3d space on your screen and produces this illusion of a distance between the z plane and myself the person viewing the screen so now what's going to happen is if i say perspective and then let's go 1000 pixels now what's going to happen here i'll tell explain how this value the numeric value works but let's see what it looks like first so now it looks threedimensional it actually has the proper the proper shape the back looks smaller than the front it's it looks like it's coming towards us a little bit what if i change this to like 600. now you can see he's way more um exaggerated that threedimensional effect so the smaller this value the more exaggerated effect because that's that means that you are closer to this element on the zplane so you're looking at something closer as if i were looking at my phone like this the back side looks smaller than the front side it's got this dramatic effect whereas if i was like this further away it's much less exaggerated versus that so hopefully that makes sense okay so i'm going to go back to i'm going to say 1200 so it's it's there it's it's 3d but it's not crazy exaggerated now as you can see it's way down here it's not in the right space it looks kind of sloppy especially if i hovered it it would fall down the page would look really weird so we're going to remedy that with translate so we're going to translate on the x axis 35 pixels this is simply like doing uh positioning but in 3d space so translate 35 pixels that's going to move it to the left translate on the yaxis and we're going to say zero pixels we don't want it that's up and down and then translate on the z axis and that will bring us back up to the space where i want it so now we're looking a lot better so if i were to say layers hover now layers hover image save that let's see what that looks like i hover it shifts and transitions there it looks pretty good and that's because we did the transition property up here if i were to take that out this would be a lot less nice as you can see it's that transition that shows us we're going into threedimensional space so now what i want to do is position these in the proper i want them to to expand out i want it to like give us that well that effect down here where it all kind of layers out that's nice so we want to do that so we're going to achieve that by individually styling each image or each layer so i'm going to say layers hover image of the class of mid and i'm going to go ahead and copy this entire thing paste it and change a couple of the values now i can i probably could take out the values that i don't need like maybe if i just took out all of these and left translate z translate zed for us canadians and i'm going to change that to 240 pixels let's see if just having one value there works it doesn't the reason why is because now i'm saying that transform is not present for all the other x y and z planes so i have to leave it in all of these values translate z i'm going to change back to 240 check it out when i hover you see that layer is now lifted off of the background copy this now the rest is super easy paste that whole thing out image top we're going to change the value of the last one to 80. so that's going to be 280 pixels further on the z plane and i'm going to refresh and hover now we've got our second layer like that last but not least copy that paste it out and now we're going to do the tipi class and that translate z it's going to be as you can see in here it's unusual the way that this floats in space is because it's a different proportions than these other elements so we have to use different values to move it in the right uh in the right place so you might think 240 280 this one's obviously going to be 320 but that would really mess things up as you'll see here it's just really too far and so there's something about the size of this svg that just means we have to change that value so it's actually 260. i'm not entirely sure why if i really looked into it i'd figure it out and maybe you have an idea but this gives us the right effect so now they're all about the same distance from each other in that in space in 3d space and really that is it for our 3d layer effect now here's a challenge for you feel free to maneuver this in whatever way you want the thing is these this is a little bit tricky and finicky if you're looking for a responsive effect right now i've hardcoded the width so that we don't really have uh any issues but even in the background here the background is a 100 you could see things are looking a little bit different here the other thing is when you hover over this layer these layers come out and then hover again at any point in that transition it it does like a weird as you could see like it kind of starts the animation from where you clicked on it or where you hovered so it really messes with it and it's really unusual so you'd have to do this in the right controlled space and uh really play around with it to make sure you're doing the right thing so you don't have a really wonky looking animation this is really for demo purposes to show you what you can do with 3d space rotates translates transforms and everything like that i hope today's lesson was valuable educational and fun for you thanks for hanging out for day 26 tomorrow we're closing in on the last few days here and i'll see you in day number 27.
