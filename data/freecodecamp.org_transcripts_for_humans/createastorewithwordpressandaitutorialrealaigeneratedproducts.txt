00:00 - welcome to this course on how you can
00:01 - use WordPress and AI to create a fully
00:04 - functional store that sells products
00:07 - created by AI I'm Bo KS and I teach this
00:10 - course I recently received this package
00:13 - in the mail and let's see what it is I
00:16 - haven't actually opened this yet so
00:20 - um okay it's a sticker I ordered this AI
00:24 - generated sticker using the e-commerce
00:26 - site I will show you how to create in
00:28 - this tutorial with this method you don't
00:30 - have to mail anything yourself but even
00:33 - if you don't want to create an
00:34 - e-commerce site this course can still
00:36 - help you you'll learn how to create a
00:38 - WordPress website and get help from
00:40 - artificial intelligence to create any
00:42 - website you need a domain name and a
00:44 - place to host the files in this course
00:47 - we'll be using hostinger hostinger
00:49 - provided a grant to make this course
00:51 - possible hostinger is optimized for
00:53 - WordPress sites and they offer a 99.9%
00:56 - guarantee they also have recently
00:58 - Incorporated some AI tools to make web
01:01 - development easier this is actually the
01:03 - first time I've seen this sticker and it
01:05 - looks pretty nice so to get started with
01:07 - your domain name and hosting you can go
01:09 - to hostinger.com or there's a lot of
01:11 - other hosting providers as well they may
01:13 - or may not have some of these AI tools
01:15 - that hosting or offers you can choose
01:18 - the plan premium or business for you if
01:21 - you want AI tools you do need to choose
01:24 - the business plan so we just do add to
01:27 - cart and basically you're just going to
01:29 - go through these steps to add this to
01:31 - your to your cart to create an account
01:34 - and to buy your hosting and your domain
01:36 - once you get logged into to hostinger
01:39 - and you have your account you can click
01:40 - claim domain it may not look exactly the
01:43 - same as my button but you should have
01:45 - that button somewhere and then you may
01:47 - have to experiment with some different
01:50 - domains to find one that's not already
01:52 - taken but I'm going to try coder
01:55 - stickers coders stickers.com because I'm
01:58 - creating a website to sell stickers for
02:01 - software
02:02 - developers okay and the reason why I was
02:05 - able to get on my first try is because I
02:07 - already checked some domains and that
02:10 - like the first mini mini I checked
02:12 - didn't exist but I already had this one
02:15 - in mind because I I knew it wasn't taken
02:16 - yet so I'm going to claim that domain
02:18 - okay and good I have my fake contact
02:23 - information because uh one time I
02:25 - accidentally put in my real contact
02:27 - information and then I got tons of uh
02:30 - spam calls in marketing so you either
02:33 - want to use you're supposed to use your
02:36 - your real contact information but I I if
02:39 - you do make sure you uh choose the
02:42 - option to hide it because they will
02:45 - contact you okay finished
02:54 - registration now that you have your
02:56 - domain depending on how you purchase
02:58 - your hosting
03:00 - uh you can connect your website to your
03:02 - hosting there may be a different method
03:03 - depending on if you got your domain
03:05 - first or your hosting first but I'm
03:07 - going to connect it to the business web
03:14 - hosting so you may have purchased the
03:16 - business web hosting you may have
03:18 - purchased the premium web hosting or
03:20 - completely different one but I'm going
03:22 - to connect it to the business web
03:23 - hosting cuz it has the most AI tools
03:26 - associated with it and this course is
03:30 - all about how to use AI tools to develop
03:32 - a website quickly so we are going to
03:36 - create a new
03:37 - website and then so we can either do
03:40 - WordPress with AI or hosting or Builder
03:43 - with AI hosting or Builder is part of
03:46 - Hosting or it's their own builder now
03:49 - WordPress with AI is obviously WordPress
03:52 - and WordPress is going to give a a lot
03:55 - more plugins so there's going to be a
03:58 - little more customized you can do so it
04:01 - is a little harder it says right here
04:03 - needs more experience so if you just
04:04 - want something simple you're going to be
04:06 - able to build a website very quick with
04:08 - this website builder you just basically
04:10 - type in the website you want and the AI
04:12 - Builder just builds the whole website
04:13 - for you but we're going to go with
04:15 - WordPress because that's going to give
04:16 - us a little more uh customization
04:19 - options so I'll go select WordPress with
04:23 - AI and then we just have to set the
04:26 - language administrator uh email and the
04:29 - passord
04:29 - [Music]
04:33 - password and now we can choose what
04:36 - plugins we want now a lot of these are
04:39 - going to be helpful I mean this is going
04:41 - to help us track the statistics and this
04:45 - will help with email Subs subscribers if
04:48 - we want to email list all in Wise SEO is
04:51 - kind of this built-in thing that will
04:54 - help with search engine optimization
04:56 - which we want if we don't forms we're
04:57 - going to want WP form and then
04:59 - woocommerce we're going to add this
05:01 - because we are creating a store so now I
05:05 - I'm going to skip the Google site kit
05:08 - and just hit
05:10 - continue now we can choose our theme or
05:15 - our template and there's going to be a
05:17 - bunch of different options depending on
05:19 - what we want to do so I could click show
05:20 - more and we can see a lot more
05:24 - now if uh if you're creating a Blog the
05:27 - hosting or blog is actually pretty good
05:30 - one because a lot of stuff is set up to
05:32 - work with it since we're creating a
05:33 - store I'm going to go with
05:36 - storefront and now here is the AI one of
05:41 - the AI tools that we're going to look at
05:43 - automate your text Creation with AI so I
05:46 - just have to put in my brand name my
05:48 - business details and then uh chat gbt or
05:52 - probably more realistically the open AI
05:54 - API is going to generate some piece of
05:56 - content for the website so I'm going to
05:59 - put for the brand
06:01 - name code
06:03 - stickers and then we'll just put a
06:05 - description here and then here's a
06:08 - description which I actually did create
06:11 - with chat gbt I told it what we wanted
06:13 - and just put it right in it then it came
06:14 - up with this description I'll just read
06:16 - a little bit we are your go-to
06:17 - destination for the expressive and
06:18 - whimsicle developer theme stickers that
06:20 - add a spark of creativity to your
06:22 - workspace our extens extensive
06:24 - collection of design is designed to
06:26 - celebrate the quirks and culture of the
06:28 - programming community and that kind of
06:29 - gives a little information little some
06:32 - examples bug related stickers language
06:35 - specific decals uh way to Adorn your
06:37 - laptop notebooks and Beyond so all this
06:40 - information is going to be taken by the
06:43 - the AI Builder tool to create the
06:46 - content that the the initial content for
06:49 - our website so I'll just hit continue oh
06:52 - you can also um look at like it has an
06:54 - example and then these green lines here
06:57 - will indicate how good of a description
07:00 - you have created so if your description
07:03 - isn't very good like if it's like a
07:05 - short description um you're you're not
07:08 - going to have as many green
07:10 - lines so see it's going to be just
07:12 - yellow here but I'm going to put that
07:14 - all back and then we'll hit
07:17 - continue okay so I'm going to you can
07:20 - either uh claim a domain which we
07:22 - already have or choose a do domain we
07:24 - already created the domain so we'll
07:26 - choose coders stickers.com
07:31 - and then I'll just click finish
07:36 - setup and so now it's uh just putting it
07:39 - all together it's initializing the setup
07:41 - and creating all the
07:43 - pages okay we can see that content
07:46 - Generation by AI is underway so it's
07:48 - just happening in the background so we
07:51 - are going to either go directly into
07:53 - editing the website or the hosting or
07:55 - control panel let's start by going to
07:57 - the hosting or control panel and then
07:59 - we'll go into the editing the
08:03 - website okay uh we can see that the SSL
08:06 - is installed automatically which is
08:09 - really good I'm not going to update my
08:10 - address right now but uh this is good
08:13 - that the SSL was installed so we can
08:16 - have a secure website and that just
08:17 - happens automatically through hostinger
08:21 - before we start setting up the website
08:23 - let's set up the email so you get a free
08:25 - email and it's pinning setup so I'll
08:27 - just click setup
08:29 - and uh we you can see we have a few
08:32 - different options we're just going to
08:34 - get the free basic
08:36 - one and I'm just going to be at Bow
08:39 - atcoder stickers.com and then we put the
08:52 - password and Recovery
08:58 - email
08:59 - and create new
09:01 - account okay so now we can access the
09:05 - web mail right here so if I put in the
09:11 - password and that is my recovery email
09:16 - okay we are in the email account so
09:19 - insert emails sent by you are not marked
09:22 - as spam we can set the DK
09:24 - dkim so let's do that for now so it says
09:27 - setting up the dkim record for your
09:29 - domain will help prevent your emails
09:31 - from going to spam which is definitely
09:34 - something we want to do so let's so to
09:36 - set up the dkim record we need to be on
09:39 - the hosting or control panel and then
09:41 - I'll go to the emails tab email
09:45 - accounts and then we'll go to manage
09:48 - here and it's actually giving us an
09:50 - indication of what we need to do your
09:51 - email reputation is currently po add SPF
09:54 - and dkim Records to improve it can click
09:57 - here or I'm going click down here where
09:58 - it says email
10:00 - reputation and then we here have here
10:03 - I'm going to scroll down a little
10:07 - more and it's going to basically give us
10:10 - the instructions
10:13 - here so we're going to get the DNS host
10:17 - name here and then back on the the main
10:20 - hosting or dashboard I'm going to go to
10:24 - domains then I'm going to
10:27 - manage the domain and then I'm going to
10:30 - click on dnsname
10:33 - servers okay now where it says manage
10:35 - DNS records I'm going to go to the type
10:40 - txt and then for name I'm just going to
10:44 - paste in the name we had before that I
10:49 - copied and then I need to get this txt
10:51 - record value and paste that in here the
10:55 - TTL is going to just stay the same and
10:57 - I'll click add record
11:00 - now you may not need to do this if it's
11:03 - already if you already have the record
11:05 - but whether you're creating a new record
11:07 - or you're adding a record you're going
11:08 - to say I've added txt records to my DNS
11:11 - control panel and then verify changes oh
11:14 - it's verified okay and so now both of
11:19 - these are verified and we should be all
11:21 - good so we can get rid of this we
11:25 - definitely don't want
11:26 - notifications and there is a desk type
11:30 - desktop app if you want to set that up
11:33 - but other than that you can now email
11:35 - and receive emails to your email address
11:39 - here okay now that we're we're back on
11:41 - the hosting dashboard and now we want to
11:44 - start making modifications to our
11:46 - website so there's a few ways to do it
11:49 - one of them is just to click on this
11:51 - admin pan panel
11:53 - here okay our website is published and
11:57 - it's going to give you a list of things
11:58 - that you can can do the first thing is
12:00 - upload your logo and then you'll notice
12:02 - here that we have an AI assistant which
12:04 - we'll talk about in a little bit but
12:05 - first of all let's actually do this and
12:08 - you can see that there is an AI logo
12:11 - maker so I'm going to go to the AI logo
12:13 - maker this is from hostinger and I am
12:16 - going to put the the website name which
12:19 - is coder
12:21 - stickers and I will put the brand
12:24 - description from before and just click
12:26 - Start
12:27 - creating and then we just see what type
12:30 - of logo do we want I'm going go with an
12:33 - abstract icon and then we can we have we
12:38 - start with one credit so you can
12:40 - generate a logo but I'm just going to
12:42 - use a logo I already have so after you
12:45 - have your logo we can just go to
12:49 - appearance
12:54 - customize and here is going to be the
12:57 - customizer to customize the
13:00 - page and it's going to kind of walk us
13:03 - through it through us here and when it
13:05 - says uh add your logo so let's do that
13:08 - right now so I'm going to select the
13:18 - logo okay and this is actually an AI
13:21 - generated logo and I'll just click
13:27 - select now it's kind of a busy logo I
13:29 - could have gone with something more
13:31 - simple but it's just up to you what you
13:36 - want and it's going to walk us through
13:38 - it's also going to walk us through how
13:40 - to customize the navigation
13:42 - menus and so you can see the navigation
13:45 - menus that we have right here home C
13:48 - check out now you can see this is very
13:50 - simple but we are going to um actually
13:54 - customize it to make it a little nicer
13:56 - and we're not going to go through all
13:59 - this stuff right now um we're actually
14:01 - going to come back later to do some of
14:03 - these you can choose your accent color
14:05 - your color your buttons and then you
14:08 - want to save and publish when you're
14:10 - when you're ready um we'll just save and
14:12 - publish this with our logo so then let's
14:15 - just kind of look at what the page looks
14:16 - like so far
14:19 - so you can see it says
14:23 - express your uh developer theme stickers
14:25 - from Cod stickers.com now un
14:28 - unfortunately when I put in the the
14:30 - description I put the URL wrong and it's
14:32 - supposed to be coders stickers.com but
14:35 - we can easily go in and update that
14:37 - stuff but one thing you can see is that
14:40 - this text is all just created uh by AI
14:47 - so uh we can see um there's basically
14:49 - different blog posts that's created for
14:52 - our our our uh store express yourself
14:55 - with developer theme stickers from codes
14:57 - stickers.com and then it gives a whole
14:59 - description of what's on the site
15:02 - express your coding Persona with
15:03 - whimsicle developer
15:04 - stickers and so it's going to create a a
15:09 - few different articles another one
15:11 - express yourself with wisle developer
15:13 - themed stickers so it looks like some of
15:15 - these articles have very similar titles
15:18 - and uh text but we can actually go
15:22 - through and easily update this so add a
15:26 - spark of creativity or workspace with
15:27 - code stickers express your coding
15:29 - personality with codee stickers so it
15:31 - has all these built-in articles that we
15:33 - can go through and update if we want
15:35 - right now let's look at how to more
15:37 - quickly update what this looks like so
15:40 - this is the homepage with a different
15:41 - blog post and we're going to be updating
15:43 - what all this looks like pretty soon
15:45 - here but we have the cart uh cart is
15:48 - currently empty
15:49 - checkout um where you can actually check
15:52 - out after you order something we haven't
15:54 - added any products yet though uh my
15:56 - account and Shop
15:59 - so shop there's no products but we're
16:00 - going to add some products now I'm back
16:03 - at the admin page and we are going to
16:06 - get to the AI system in a minute but
16:08 - let's do some basic things to make our
16:10 - website look a little better for now so
16:12 - I'm going to go to appearance and then
16:15 - I'm going to go to storefront now that
16:17 - is the name of our theme so if you use a
16:20 - different theme there may be a different
16:22 - way to customize it but since we're
16:23 - creating a store I'm going to customize
16:25 - it through this page here basically it's
16:27 - going to walk us through it so I'm going
16:29 - to go to let's
16:31 - go so now it's already going
16:35 - to uh make the page look a little
16:37 - different from before before it started
16:39 - with the blog now it's going to come
16:41 - right into this welcome page shop by
16:43 - category and you can see we have new in
16:47 - we recommend fan favorites uh but if we
16:50 - click here
16:51 - accessories it's going to have some
16:54 - products so these are just some sample
16:56 - products that we can and uh customize
17:00 - later basically now this store is
17:02 - looking a little better it's it's filled
17:04 - out a little bit and you can see what
17:06 - it's going to look like and right now
17:09 - there's just 12 sample products here but
17:12 - we are going to update all this so it
17:14 - can be customized for our our
17:18 - use so let's start customizing this a
17:21 - little further for one I think this is
17:24 - kind of a little too tall so I'm going
17:26 - to switch this out to a shorter version
17:29 - of this logo and we're going to put this
17:30 - whole big thing in the welcome page so
17:33 - let's see how we would do that I'm going
17:35 - to go to site
17:36 - identity and then change logo and then
17:40 - I'm just going to change to one I I
17:42 - basically use an image editing software
17:44 - to uh make get just the text and not the
17:49 - stuff inside the text so I'm going to
17:52 - also add an ALT text so I can put coder
17:56 - stickers logo
17:59 - and then hit
18:03 - select and then crop
18:07 - image okay and now we have this so it's
18:10 - not quite as tall okay now I'm going to
18:13 - add a site icon so do you remember in
18:16 - the full version there was like a
18:17 - computer with a little face in it so I'm
18:20 - going to use that as a site icon so I
18:23 - already cut out that picture but now I'm
18:26 - going to use this upscale program this
18:28 - is a free program for Mac OS and I think
18:30 - there is a Windows version too and I can
18:33 - just bring in this is that little face
18:35 - that I cut out and now I'm just going to
18:37 - upscale it and I have on the digital art
18:40 - setting and now you can see it's going
18:43 - to look a lot better now now we can get
18:46 - it to be the right um the right
18:49 - resolution of 512 x 512 and then I just
18:53 - use an image editing to get exactly 512
18:55 - x 512 and then I can set the site icon
18:58 - and just bring it in here and then I'll
19:01 - put
19:05 - icon
19:09 - okay okay so we got the icon and now I
19:13 - can go back
19:16 - here and now we can go through if we
19:19 - want and update a lot of these things
19:21 - like the header image that be behind
19:23 - here we could update the the footer so
19:27 - that's what's down here like if I um
19:29 - change the background color to Yellow
19:33 - you can see it changes to Yellow well we
19:35 - we don't want to do that let's change it
19:37 - to the same yellow in this coder
19:39 - stickers logo so to get that that that
19:42 - color we're going to have to figure out
19:43 - the hex value if I click here um I I
19:46 - already got the hex value in my image
19:48 - editor program and then I can just paste
19:51 - it right in here so if we go down here
19:53 - now we have this as the same color in
19:56 - our logo and then you can see see we can
19:58 - go through and basically change any
20:00 - colors we want and then you can just
20:02 - keep customizing a few other things and
20:04 - then once you're done you can hit we can
20:06 - hit publish now I'm just going to
20:07 - actually just go copy this this website
20:10 - and go to the website so this is what it
20:11 - looks like so far so you can see now
20:15 - it's actually filling in all these
20:17 - things like the we recommend fam
20:19 - favorites on sale best sellers we're
20:21 - going to make some additional
20:23 - adjustments so let me go back here and
20:26 - then I hit X we'll go back over to
20:30 - here so if you want you can get some
20:34 - other designs and extensions like here
20:37 - we're not going to do it but if we click
20:38 - check them out we can see some other um
20:41 - other themes that we can get now some of
20:44 - them are going to cost money some of
20:45 - them are going to be free but like if I
20:47 - click here we can see this one is a free
20:49 - download for this theme we're just going
20:51 - to use the basic theme that we already
20:54 - have for now visit the site here and
20:57 - once so I already have had it open but I
20:59 - could also just click here visit site
21:01 - and then once I'm visiting the site
21:04 - let's see how we can edit this page well
21:06 - I'm just going to go different pages are
21:08 - edited in different ways but for this
21:10 - main page I'm going to just click edit
21:13 - page up
21:16 - here and then it's going to kind of tell
21:18 - you about the the block editor but I can
21:21 - kind of go over that so what I'm going
21:23 - to do is get rid of this heading um I'm
21:26 - going to actually just get rid of all
21:27 - this text
21:28 - and we are going to add some more text
21:29 - but first i'm going to um type slash and
21:32 - then we can add an image and we'll go to
21:36 - the media library we'll use this one
21:38 - that's already in our media
21:40 - library and then I'm going to make this
21:42 - a centered a
21:44 - line
21:46 - Center and we can change some settings
21:50 - about it so instead of it being so big
21:53 - we can go to medium we can go to
21:56 - thumbnail and I'm going to go to medium
21:58 - here and obviously this doesn't really
22:00 - look good on this other image so we're
22:03 - going to put a different image in the
22:05 - background and uh you can kind of do a
22:08 - mix of creating images with AI or we can
22:11 - go and get some royaltyfree images so
22:14 - I'm going to have the background image
22:16 - selected and I'm going to click replace
22:18 - and we'll do open media library and here
22:21 - instead of using this image I'm going to
22:22 - go to pixels which has some royaltyfree
22:25 - images there's a few pages for
22:26 - royaltyfree images or you can use an AI
22:28 - image generator so I'm going to
22:33 - say code
22:39 - background actually let's try software
22:45 - background okay I don't like these with
22:48 - chat GPT I can create an image so I'm
22:50 - going to say create a light
22:54 - colorful
22:56 - background image filled with
23:00 - software
23:05 - code now there's plenty of other image
23:08 - generators if you don't have access to
23:11 - Dolly 3 or chat GPT uh and you can also
23:15 - use the royaltyfree
23:21 - images okay I'm just going to go with
23:23 - this one so I'm going to download this
23:25 - image obviously you could spend more
23:27 - time on this if you wanted and then I'll
23:29 - upload the
23:33 - image and then I can make some
23:35 - adjustments like if I go to
23:38 - block um I can click here and now I can
23:43 - make it lighter I am going to make it
23:44 - lighter so then the logo will stand out
23:47 - a little more now we could spend a
23:49 - little more time making this match a
23:51 - little more but we'll just continue if
23:53 - you want when you're making your own
23:55 - store you can uh spend as much time as
23:57 - you want on making the different things
23:58 - look good actually we'll do one more
24:00 - thing we'll put in a heading here and
24:03 - I'll say heading now we'll just put our
24:05 - slogan which is going to be stick with
24:08 - code code with
24:13 - stickers and I'm also going to Center
24:24 - that now we can see that there's these
24:26 - short codes that can put in different
24:28 - things like uh the short code it's going
24:31 - to put in all the categories on top and
24:34 - then it's going to put in different
24:37 - products and these products see if I
24:41 - click on here it highlights this whole
24:44 - new product section and if I look over
24:48 - here it's going to say display a grid of
24:50 - your newest products so this section is
24:53 - always is going to show newest products
24:55 - this section is always going to show the
24:57 - handpick products display a selection of
25:00 - handpick products in the grid and fam
25:02 - favorites uh this is the ones that ra
25:05 - the the top now these are automatically
25:07 - generated based on the criteria um so if
25:11 - we go to we recommend you can choose
25:14 - what's going to show up do you want the
25:16 - the pro you can turn off product image
25:19 - um you can turn off product title takes
25:21 - a little bit to update but you can
25:23 - change the price you can turn on on and
25:25 - off the rating and stuff like this and
25:27 - then here here products here's where you
25:30 - can choose the products the you can see
25:32 - we have hoodie hoodie with pocket hoodie
25:34 - with zipper so the products can be
25:36 - chosen right here for what you recommend
25:39 - but then some of these are just
25:40 - developed automatically like fan
25:42 - favorites these are going to be
25:44 - automatically based on the rating and
25:47 - but there's an other settings you can do
25:49 - for each section and then you can choose
25:51 - the on sale products now personally I
25:54 - think this is too much so you don't need
25:55 - all these set these sections so I'm I'm
25:57 - going to get rid of some of them I'm
25:59 - going to get rid of on sale uh best
26:03 - sellers I can just basically delete
26:06 - it I'll I'll just keep fan I'll just
26:09 - keep the we recommend and fan favorites
26:12 - and then we also have no no we won't
26:14 - even have fan favorites we're trying to
26:16 - simplify this
26:18 - store and we're just going to have um
26:22 - new n and we recommend except I want to
26:25 - uh change the order of the SE
26:28 - so I want to get this we
26:30 - recommend above the the new end so see
26:34 - this I can select this section the we
26:36 - recommend section and then just do move
26:39 - up move up move up and then I have to go
26:42 - to the we recommend um you can obviously
26:44 - make changes to the font the style and
26:46 - every and the text so I'm going to just
26:48 - click up up up and now we're going to
26:50 - have shopy category we recommend and
26:53 - then the new
26:56 - n
26:58 - and you can also change what the the
27:02 - preview is this is like in Google if
27:04 - someone searches it will show this uh
27:07 - preview of what's going to be on the
27:09 - page and you can make updates to that
27:11 - you can make updates to the page title
27:14 - The Meta description and there's a bunch
27:16 - of things that you can uh change and you
27:19 - can see it also even gives you a page
27:22 - analysis so you can see the Met
27:24 - description is over 160 characters so if
27:26 - we change that
27:28 - I'm going to just delete that so let's
27:30 - try this description if we go down here
27:32 - we see that we have a good content
27:34 - length and then you can go through here
27:37 - and fix all these and we see we have
27:39 - some other problems we can go through
27:41 - each one and fix them I'm not going to
27:44 - take the time to do that right now but
27:46 - you can do that on your own okay I'm
27:48 - just going to click
27:49 - update and
27:51 - then we can view the page and now we can
27:55 - see the updated page and it's getting
27:56 - more
28:01 - customized okay let's customize it
28:03 - further we want to uh customize the
28:07 - links up here and we can see we actually
28:09 - do have the the blog here so you can see
28:11 - these blog posts and we're going to
28:14 - actually customize all these pages to
28:17 - make it work better for what we want
28:19 - first of all we want the shop to be the
28:21 - second link at their home it's the most
28:22 - important part since this is a shop so
28:25 - to update this menu here we're have to
28:27 - go back to the wp admin the WordPress
28:31 - admin page and then we're going to go to
28:34 - appearance and menus here I'm already on
28:36 - the menus page then we're going to
28:37 - create a new menu so I'll just put Main
28:41 - and then we will make this the primary
28:44 - menu and create
28:46 - menu and we these notifications we don't
28:49 - need to worry about that and now I can
28:53 - add items to the menu so for first going
28:56 - to add the shop top page and then we're
28:58 - going to add the cart checkout and let's
29:02 - just look at what's already on here we
29:03 - got cart checkout my account shop so
29:07 - we're going to basically add all those
29:08 - same things but just change the order so
29:11 - I'm also want the the blog page and I
29:14 - should have been clicking add to menu
29:18 - here okay so it's going to be the shop
29:21 - first then
29:24 - Blog then cart then
29:28 - checkout then my account and then I will
29:32 - save the
29:35 - menu now let's go to the page and I'll
29:37 - just refresh the
29:41 - page okay that works shop blog cart
29:44 - check out my account we don't have the
29:45 - main page anymore but that's okay CU
29:47 - when you click the logo here it should
29:49 - load the main page and most people are
29:51 - used to that so we have shop blog cart
29:53 - checkout main account great and actually
29:56 - I'm gonna go back to the main screen we
29:59 - go to get started and we're going to go
30:01 - to AI assistant so now we can see how we
30:05 - can create content with AI and it's
30:08 - going to be uh efor lent timesaving SEO
30:11 - friendly and so we can see what type of
30:13 - content do we need want to make a post a
30:16 - page a product so we can make all sorts
30:19 - of things with AI so um this this is
30:24 - going to be why Developers
30:30 - should put
30:32 - stickers on
30:33 - [Music]
30:35 - their
30:37 - laptops and we can change the tone
30:39 - neutral formal TR I'm going to change
30:41 - this to Friendly and witty and it'll
30:45 - make
30:46 - it long okay so now I'll just do
30:50 - generate
30:56 - content
30:59 - okay good we have an image and then we
31:02 - have the the article sticker up your
31:05 - laptop why developers should embrace the
31:07 - art of personalization as a developer
31:09 - your laptop is the most prized
31:11 - possession and then it talks about uh
31:13 - adding a touch of Personality we're
31:15 - talking about stickers and it gives all
31:18 - show off your interest Foster creative
31:19 - environment stand out from the crowd
31:21 - it's just plain fun so I'm just going to
31:23 - publish it we just now have a new
31:25 - article on our blog
31:28 - and I could have done edit as draft to
31:30 - personalize it but now we can see we
31:32 - have an article on our blog just like
31:35 - this and so here's the blog
31:38 - post we see this we see everything and
31:41 - people can even comment on it and log in
31:43 - and comment on it if we want to
31:45 - customize what these blog posts look
31:47 - like well one way to go about it is to
31:48 - click this edit post so edit post is is
31:52 - where we can actually edit the words we
31:55 - can say as a developer your laptop is
31:58 - your most important possession good now
32:01 - it's a now this is an article actually
32:04 - written by me since I put at least one
32:05 - word into it and you can change all
32:08 - these things and even has a page
32:10 - analysis
32:14 - here okay we know how to add a blog post
32:18 - now let's get to the real the real stuff
32:21 - of what this is this is a store so let's
32:23 - customize the shop specifically let's
32:27 - add new products we are going to add
32:30 - stickers that people can actually buy in
32:33 - real
32:36 - life so if we go back to our
32:40 - WordPress uh dashboard we go to
32:43 - products and then it's going to show all
32:46 - the products um so before we were just
32:48 - using these products as examples we
32:52 - don't want any of those products so I am
32:54 - going to select here and then I I'm just
32:57 - going to move to
33:00 - bin and apply so I just select all the
33:04 - products and I deleted all the products
33:07 - so now we we are just about to start
33:10 - adding new products but first we have to
33:14 - create the products so remember these
33:17 - are this is a a sticker store and we are
33:20 - going to use AI to create our sticker
33:23 - designs so for that we need an AI image
33:26 - generator there's a plenty of them out
33:28 - there like I've mentioned I'm going to
33:30 - use gbd4 with uh Dolly the beta version
33:34 - and if you don't have access to this
33:36 - version there's plenty of other ones you
33:38 - can use some of them are open source and
33:40 - you can run locally or on a website and
33:43 - this is what I'm going to do I'll say
33:46 - create some
33:48 - sticker
33:52 - designs
33:53 - for my sticker store
33:59 - here is the description of the store and
34:04 - I'll just put the description we made
34:08 - earlier welcome to coders stickers.com
34:10 - the premier Online Marketplace where
34:12 - every sticker tells a code
34:19 - story okay now I'm going to say create a
34:24 - few more but the website
34:28 - name should not be on
34:31 - them but some of these stickers I like
34:33 - I'm still going to use some of these uh
34:35 - this one I like so I'm going to download
34:38 - this
34:40 - one and this is interesting because uh I
34:45 - guess they're a bug I don't know what
34:47 - that's supposed to be but sure we're
34:49 - we're going to create that as a sticker
34:51 - and then this is going to be a sticker
34:53 - I'm going to just download that let's
34:54 - see what else it comes up with
35:01 - oh yeah this is I like that
35:04 - one
35:06 - nice okay and I'm actually going to take
35:08 - all these into an image editor to kind
35:10 - of cut them out to to process them
35:12 - better for our
35:17 - store now create a few more sticker
35:21 - designs for software
35:25 - Developers
35:27 - now uh let's I'm going to actually
35:29 - change the
35:31 - prompt now make a list of sticker design
35:35 - ideas for software developers then
35:37 - create the best
35:45 - ideas so we're going to see if it can
35:48 - create better stickers if it first
35:50 - creates the
35:55 - list
36:06 - okay let's look at
36:09 - these oh these are really cool actually
36:13 - I'm G to do that one that
36:15 - one actually I don't know if I can do
36:17 - this one because it's
36:19 - um it's kind of cut off on the
36:23 - edge uh but this one is also going to be
36:25 - a good one
36:29 - this is almost like a devops sticker now
36:33 - what I'm going to do I'm going to go
36:35 - into my image editor okay I'm using
36:38 - Affinity photo but you may be using
36:40 - Photoshop there's also canva and there's
36:42 - a lot of free online image editors you
36:44 - can use so you can basically do this in
36:46 - any image editor so what I'm going to do
36:49 - is uh basically delete all the parts
36:52 - that are not going to be in the sticker
36:54 - uh we want it to be uh transparent
36:57 - around the actual sticker so I'm going
37:01 - to select this I will um select this
37:08 - let's see if I change the tolerance
37:11 - that's too much
37:15 - so I deleted everything around but then
37:17 - I need to add some stuff back I'm I'm
37:20 - going to add a white
37:24 - outline okay now I just have to delete a
37:27 - few extra things
37:32 - here and then I'll crop the image so we
37:35 - can see we have the transparent stuff
37:37 - around the image and then we do have a
37:40 - white border around
37:42 - everything and then I'm going to save it
37:44 - and then I'll just start on another one
37:46 - this should be pretty easy to select
37:53 - out usually I like to put a white line
37:55 - around it but this one I'm not I'll just
37:57 - save it just like this and then another
38:06 - one and then I'll just do a few more off
38:10 - camera so I made a bunch of stickers and
38:14 - I want to make it so people can actually
38:16 - buy the stickers I found this website
38:19 - called printful there's a few other
38:21 - websites like this where they will print
38:23 - on demand uh this is not the only one
38:26 - you can use there's a few other ones but
38:28 - I'm actually going to create the
38:29 - stickers on printful and then add them
38:31 - to my WordPress site and then people
38:33 - will actually be able to order and then
38:35 - they will print them on demand so first
38:38 - I have to make a new product so if I go
38:41 - to product
38:42 - catalog
38:44 - um
38:46 - actually so if I go to product template
38:48 - I'll say create
38:50 - product and then I just go to
38:54 - stickers I can search for stickers
38:57 - and we want kiss cut stickers um mainly
39:00 - this is the cheapest type of stickers
39:03 - and a kiss cut sticker means it will be
39:05 - cut out along the edge of the sticker
39:08 - that's why we needed the
39:09 - transparency because uh the transparency
39:12 - is where it will be um cut off so I'm
39:15 - just going to drag my sticker design
39:18 - into
39:20 - here and I could add a few other
39:22 - different types of products but I'm not
39:24 - going to but we can see what it's going
39:25 - to look up look like I can click
39:28 - mockups and then you can see what it's
39:30 - going to look like on a a a computer or
39:35 - a car and you can see the transparency
39:38 - it doesn't become any part of the
39:39 - sticker so that's why we need to create
39:41 - that
39:42 - transparency okay so now that we have
39:44 - the sticker we can also choose what
39:47 - sizes we want I'll just keep all the
39:49 - sizes though I think the small sizes
39:52 - will will be better for the sticker and
39:54 - I'll just do save to templates
39:59 - and then I'm going to add the rest of
40:00 - the stickers just like that but we still
40:02 - see we have a a few of them here so I'm
40:05 - going to do add to store and I need to
40:07 - connect a
40:09 - store so let's just click connect
40:12 - store and then I'll go to choose
40:14 - platform and then I just want to find
40:17 - WordPress oh W commas it's right here so
40:20 - connecting to
40:21 - woocommerce and it's basically going to
40:23 - give instructions here but I'll just
40:24 - show you how to do it we're going to go
40:26 - back to our WordPress settings we go to
40:30 - Blue Commerce and then I'm going to go
40:34 - to
40:36 - settings if I go to Advanced and uh it's
40:40 - going to keep showing this this we can
40:42 - do this if we want but we're not going
40:44 - to connect but I'm going to go to um
40:47 - Legacy
40:48 - API and then enable the Legacy rest
40:52 - API so the next thing we need to do is
40:55 - make sure the Perman links are set up
40:57 - correctly so go to settings Pera
41:02 - links and then I'm going to swi switch
41:04 - it to post
41:07 - name so this is something we probably
41:11 - wanted to do anyways where the links uh
41:14 - in the the default was just going to be
41:17 - like P1 23 but now it's going to
41:20 - actually say the name of the post right
41:22 - in the URL which I think looks a little
41:25 - nicer
41:26 - and it's going to be better for SEO as
41:29 - well so I'm going to go to save changes
41:32 - for
41:33 - that and now we can see if the
41:36 - woocommerce API is working so to do that
41:40 - I'm going to go to the code stickers.com
41:42 - and I'm going to type in WC API that's
41:47 - woocommerce
41:49 - V1 and so now that we're getting this
41:53 - Json that means the API is working
41:57 - correctly okay now I'm going to go back
42:00 - to um plugins we haven't really talked
42:03 - too much about plugins but they can be
42:07 - used to add extra features to
42:10 - whoops they can be used to add extra
42:12 - features to your site and we talked
42:15 - about some of the default uh plugins
42:17 - that get installed we're going to
42:19 - install the printful plug-in so I'm
42:23 - going to click add new
42:28 - and then I'll
42:36 - search and then
42:42 - install and then I have to activate
42:48 - it and now we'll have a new tab here the
42:51 - printful tab so let me click
42:53 - here and it says almost done just two
42:56 - more steps so I'm going
43:00 - to so I'm going to click
43:05 - connect follow
43:07 - link and I'm going to approve
43:11 - this now I just have to log in
43:16 - again and connect
43:20 - store okay now I'm just going to add
43:25 - product
43:27 - my product
43:29 - templates and I'm going
43:33 - to okay proceed to
43:38 - mockups and we'll just do basic
43:47 - mockups so we're going to do this mockup
43:49 - or just has the computer in the
43:51 - middle and then
43:53 - continue and we don't have to become a
43:56 - member that just gives us different
43:58 - rates so the retail price must be higher
44:02 - than the printful
44:05 - price okay now we can basically set the
44:09 - price so I'm just making it so they go
44:11 - at least a little more than the printful
44:14 - price I'm actually just going to make it
44:16 - so I make $1 for every
44:20 - sticker okay and submit to store make I
44:23 - know it's called Bubble free stickers
44:25 - but I want to change what the the title
44:30 - is so this is GNA be
44:32 - called
44:34 - coffee
44:36 - coding
44:41 - sticker I'm going to click where it says
44:43 - View and woo
44:47 - Commerce okay we have all the different
44:50 - uh computer mockups here and you can
44:53 - choose the size add to basket
44:56 - it and then we
44:59 - can then if we go to
45:01 - cart we can see that we have the
45:04 - sticker I'm going go over to printful
45:07 - and add some more now I'm just going to
45:10 - upload the rest of the images and create
45:13 - the rest of the
45:16 - products okay just added a bunch more
45:19 - stickers well not a bunch but a few
45:21 - extra and so you can all obviously
45:24 - customize what the images and what the
45:26 - mockups going to look like but now that
45:29 - they're all added I'm going to go to
45:32 - view in woo Commerce let's look at what
45:34 - our woocommerce store looks like I'm
45:36 - going to go right to the shop page and
45:39 - now we can see the the different
45:41 - stickers the Bas and Bug sticker bug
45:43 - catcher cod's art coffee coating sticker
45:47 - devops coaster
45:49 - sticker idea machine sticker uh USB tree
45:54 - I guess I forgot to type in sticker
45:55 - there
45:56 - uh so these are all the the stickers you
45:59 - can get in the shop and so if we go into
46:05 - one then we can select options so I'll
46:09 - just select
46:11 - the depending on on what you select it's
46:14 - going to uh change the size it's going
46:18 - to uh change the skew and it's going to
46:21 - make it look a different size on the the
46:27 - laptop
46:28 - mockup so if we go to 3x3 I can add that
46:33 - to
46:34 - basket and then go to the cart now we
46:37 - have the two things we have the coffee
46:38 - coating sticker we have the USB tree and
46:41 - then we'll just do proceed to check
46:44 - out so if if we look down here we can
46:48 - see it's just basically another a normal
46:49 - cart and uh there's a few things we can
46:53 - see one is that there are no available
46:55 - payment method so we have to set up the
46:57 - payment methods and the second thing is
47:00 - that I don't think I want to see these
47:04 - recent blog post on the side here so
47:06 - let's fix both of those
47:08 - things to remove this sidebar on the
47:11 - cart page and some other places um
47:13 - depending on what theme you have you can
47:16 - click
47:17 - customize and there for some themes
47:20 - there will be a way to customize it from
47:22 - in here however with this theme it's
47:24 - going to be a little trickier
47:26 - we have to go to our dashboard and we're
47:29 - going to actually have to edit a PHP
47:31 - file uh it's sounds kind of tricky but
47:34 - it's not as it's not not as hard as you
47:37 - would think we can go to appearance and
47:39 - then theme file editor and then click I
47:42 - understand now we are going to edit the
47:46 - functions.php file so I'm just going to
47:49 - scroll down to this bottom of this page
47:53 - and we're going to ignore where it says
47:55 - do not add Cod custom code here because
47:56 - we are going to add a custom code you
47:58 - just have to remember that if you update
48:02 - it's it's going to um remove it so you
48:05 - may have to add it again if you update
48:07 - so I'm just going to paste in some code
48:09 - here and this is the function remove
48:12 - storefront sidebar it's going to check
48:15 - if it's woocommerce or if it's the
48:17 - checkout then it's going to do a remove
48:19 - action and we have ADD action where it's
48:22 - going to this is where it's going to
48:23 - call the function remove storefront
48:25 - sidebar
48:26 - so I'm going to update that
48:28 - file now I just have to update one more
48:31 - file which is the CSS file so going to
48:35 - style. CS CSS and then I can just scroll
48:39 - to the bottom of this one and I'm going
48:41 - to add this I'm going to make the width
48:44 - 100% for by. woocommerce and body.
48:48 - woocommerce
48:49 - checkout and then I'll just hit update
48:53 - file and then if we go back back to our
48:56 - page and we go to the checkout page you
49:00 - can see we don't
49:02 - have the sidebar anymore here so here's
49:06 - the checkout
49:07 - page and you can see it says sorry it
49:11 - seems like there are no available
49:13 - payment methods please con so we
49:16 - basically have to add some payment
49:17 - methods that's that's going to be the
49:19 - next step here so I'm going to go to the
49:24 - dashboard
49:26 - and then I'm going to click on payments
49:28 - right here so we will install woo
49:31 - payments and you can see that there are
49:35 - no step costs or monthly fees it just
49:38 - takes a fee basically out of each sale
49:41 - that you
49:42 - make okay I'll just go through the
49:45 - setup
49:48 - process I decided not to show you that
49:50 - because there was a ton of personal
49:52 - information to get the payment set up
49:54 - that I don't want to share with with
49:55 - everybody but we got that set up and you
49:57 - can figure that out on your own if if
49:59 - you're doing the setup it's pretty
50:01 - straightforward and so it says
50:03 - congratulations your store has been
50:06 - verified so you can see that we are
50:09 - paying 27 cents per transaction Plus
50:14 - 2.61 or it normally be 30 cents per
50:17 - transaction I'm only making a dollar so
50:20 - that would be basically 70 cents per
50:22 - sticker we also have to make sure we set
50:25 - up our our shipping and taxes so to get
50:28 - our shipping set up I'm going to go to
50:31 - settings woocommerce
50:34 - settings and then I will go to ship to
50:37 - all countries you sell to I also want to
50:42 - enable tax ring calculations I might as
50:44 - well turn off the coupon codes right
50:46 - here and then I'm going to save
50:49 - changes and then go to
50:52 - shipping so I'm going to go to print
50:55 - full
50:56 - shipping enable this shipping method
50:59 - disable standard wo Commerce rates for
51:02 - products fulfilled by
51:03 - printful so we want to enable sh the
51:07 - shipping this shipping method the
51:08 - printful shipping method we want to
51:10 - disable standard woocommerce rat for
51:12 - products fulfilled by printful so
51:15 - printful is going to just handle all the
51:17 - shipping and then we are going to set
51:20 - which shipping methods we want printful
51:23 - use so we have to go to the printful tab
51:25 - here then I'll go to the settings tab
51:28 - and then I can allow printf to calculate
51:31 - the sales
51:32 - tax and I'll keep going
51:35 - down to these shipping
51:38 - methods so these are all the shipping
51:40 - methods that are offered from pimpl and
51:45 - I'm just going to keep all of these I
51:48 - mean I I could if I didn't want to offer
51:49 - some I could could take them off but
51:52 - those all look pretty good to
51:54 - me
51:56 - okay I'll save the changes because of
51:57 - the tax button I clicked
52:00 - here now let's go to the
52:03 - site look at the cart my cart's empty
52:06 - I'm going go to the
52:08 - shop
52:12 - and I'm going to choose this USB
52:16 - tree 3x3 actually I'll do the
52:20 - 4x4 I'll add the
52:23 - basket now I can go to the check
52:26 - out oh air missing or invalid printful
52:29 - store Key we have something not working
52:31 - for that so let me go to the dashboard
52:36 - again I did notice when I was in
52:38 - settings I'm going to try reconnecting
52:41 - the
52:43 - store okay now it's actually showing the
52:46 - shipping so I can click a flat rate so
52:49 - we're paying it's kind of an expensive
52:51 - sticker $3.40 for the sticker and then
52:55 - $3.99 for the
52:59 - shipping so it's it going to be a total
53:01 - of$
53:02 - 783 okay
53:07 - sure and then I place my order and it
53:09 - says order received okay so let's see
53:12 - what the order looks like in the
53:13 - dashboard so I go to the
53:15 - dashboard and if we go to woocommerce
53:19 - and orders now you can see there's going
53:21 - to be two orders I tried an order before
53:23 - that didn't really work out be um so
53:26 - this is the the other order I made that
53:27 - I kind of messed up on so if we go to
53:30 - this order so hopefully this order will
53:32 - go through if we go back to printf and
53:34 - we go to orders hopefully we'll see the
53:36 - order that's going oh okay it says it's
53:39 - failed no billing method added okay I
53:43 - have to add a billing method because uh
53:45 - stripe took the money and then we have
53:48 - to send it over to print full so addit
53:51 - building
53:52 - method so I just set up the build method
53:55 - on printful and how it works is first
53:58 - the customer pays me and then I have to
54:03 - pay printful and then hopefully I make
54:06 - some sort of profit so the first money
54:09 - comes to me and then I pay printful
54:11 - based on the money that came to me so
54:13 - let me try just uh purchasing the
54:15 - sticker one more time so I'm going to
54:17 - click USB
54:20 - tree add the
54:23 - basket check out
54:27 - okay I've placed the order now I'm going
54:29 - to look at PRL again on the order

54:40 - going to be sent to me it says orders
54:43 - waiting for fulfillment estimated
54:45 - fulfillment October 20th through 25th
54:48 - that means our store is pretty much done
54:52 - I me we can go through and customize
54:54 - things more so all that's left now is to
54:58 - add more products and use the AI tools

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to this course on how you can use WordPress and AI to create a fully functional store that sells products created by AI I'm Bo KS and I teach this course I recently received this package in the mail and let's see what it is I haven't actually opened this yet so um okay it's a sticker I ordered this AI generated sticker using the ecommerce site I will show you how to create in this tutorial with this method you don't have to mail anything yourself but even if you don't want to create an ecommerce site this course can still help you you'll learn how to create a WordPress website and get help from artificial intelligence to create any website you need a domain name and a place to host the files in this course we'll be using hostinger hostinger provided a grant to make this course possible hostinger is optimized for WordPress sites and they offer a 99.9% guarantee they also have recently Incorporated some AI tools to make web development easier this is actually the first time I've seen this sticker and it looks pretty nice so to get started with your domain name and hosting you can go to hostinger.com or there's a lot of other hosting providers as well they may or may not have some of these AI tools that hosting or offers you can choose the plan premium or business for you if you want AI tools you do need to choose the business plan so we just do add to cart and basically you're just going to go through these steps to add this to your to your cart to create an account and to buy your hosting and your domain once you get logged into to hostinger and you have your account you can click claim domain it may not look exactly the same as my button but you should have that button somewhere and then you may have to experiment with some different domains to find one that's not already taken but I'm going to try coder stickers coders stickers.com because I'm creating a website to sell stickers for software developers okay and the reason why I was able to get on my first try is because I already checked some domains and that like the first mini mini I checked didn't exist but I already had this one in mind because I I knew it wasn't taken yet so I'm going to claim that domain okay and good I have my fake contact information because uh one time I accidentally put in my real contact information and then I got tons of uh spam calls in marketing so you either want to use you're supposed to use your your real contact information but I I if you do make sure you uh choose the option to hide it because they will contact you okay finished registration now that you have your domain depending on how you purchase your hosting uh you can connect your website to your hosting there may be a different method depending on if you got your domain first or your hosting first but I'm going to connect it to the business web hosting so you may have purchased the business web hosting you may have purchased the premium web hosting or completely different one but I'm going to connect it to the business web hosting cuz it has the most AI tools associated with it and this course is all about how to use AI tools to develop a website quickly so we are going to create a new website and then so we can either do WordPress with AI or hosting or Builder with AI hosting or Builder is part of Hosting or it's their own builder now WordPress with AI is obviously WordPress and WordPress is going to give a a lot more plugins so there's going to be a little more customized you can do so it is a little harder it says right here needs more experience so if you just want something simple you're going to be able to build a website very quick with this website builder you just basically type in the website you want and the AI Builder just builds the whole website for you but we're going to go with WordPress because that's going to give us a little more uh customization options so I'll go select WordPress with AI and then we just have to set the language administrator uh email and the passord password and now we can choose what plugins we want now a lot of these are going to be helpful I mean this is going to help us track the statistics and this will help with email Subs subscribers if we want to email list all in Wise SEO is kind of this builtin thing that will help with search engine optimization which we want if we don't forms we're going to want WP form and then woocommerce we're going to add this because we are creating a store so now I I'm going to skip the Google site kit and just hit continue now we can choose our theme or our template and there's going to be a bunch of different options depending on what we want to do so I could click show more and we can see a lot more now if uh if you're creating a Blog the hosting or blog is actually pretty good one because a lot of stuff is set up to work with it since we're creating a store I'm going to go with storefront and now here is the AI one of the AI tools that we're going to look at automate your text Creation with AI so I just have to put in my brand name my business details and then uh chat gbt or probably more realistically the open AI API is going to generate some piece of content for the website so I'm going to put for the brand name code stickers and then we'll just put a description here and then here's a description which I actually did create with chat gbt I told it what we wanted and just put it right in it then it came up with this description I'll just read a little bit we are your goto destination for the expressive and whimsicle developer theme stickers that add a spark of creativity to your workspace our extens extensive collection of design is designed to celebrate the quirks and culture of the programming community and that kind of gives a little information little some examples bug related stickers language specific decals uh way to Adorn your laptop notebooks and Beyond so all this information is going to be taken by the the AI Builder tool to create the content that the the initial content for our website so I'll just hit continue oh you can also um look at like it has an example and then these green lines here will indicate how good of a description you have created so if your description isn't very good like if it's like a short description um you're you're not going to have as many green lines so see it's going to be just yellow here but I'm going to put that all back and then we'll hit continue okay so I'm going to you can either uh claim a domain which we already have or choose a do domain we already created the domain so we'll choose coders stickers.com and then I'll just click finish setup and so now it's uh just putting it all together it's initializing the setup and creating all the pages okay we can see that content Generation by AI is underway so it's just happening in the background so we are going to either go directly into editing the website or the hosting or control panel let's start by going to the hosting or control panel and then we'll go into the editing the website okay uh we can see that the SSL is installed automatically which is really good I'm not going to update my address right now but uh this is good that the SSL was installed so we can have a secure website and that just happens automatically through hostinger before we start setting up the website let's set up the email so you get a free email and it's pinning setup so I'll just click setup and uh we you can see we have a few different options we're just going to get the free basic one and I'm just going to be at Bow atcoder stickers.com and then we put the password and Recovery email and create new account okay so now we can access the web mail right here so if I put in the password and that is my recovery email okay we are in the email account so insert emails sent by you are not marked as spam we can set the DK dkim so let's do that for now so it says setting up the dkim record for your domain will help prevent your emails from going to spam which is definitely something we want to do so let's so to set up the dkim record we need to be on the hosting or control panel and then I'll go to the emails tab email accounts and then we'll go to manage here and it's actually giving us an indication of what we need to do your email reputation is currently po add SPF and dkim Records to improve it can click here or I'm going click down here where it says email reputation and then we here have here I'm going to scroll down a little more and it's going to basically give us the instructions here so we're going to get the DNS host name here and then back on the the main hosting or dashboard I'm going to go to domains then I'm going to manage the domain and then I'm going to click on dnsname servers okay now where it says manage DNS records I'm going to go to the type txt and then for name I'm just going to paste in the name we had before that I copied and then I need to get this txt record value and paste that in here the TTL is going to just stay the same and I'll click add record now you may not need to do this if it's already if you already have the record but whether you're creating a new record or you're adding a record you're going to say I've added txt records to my DNS control panel and then verify changes oh it's verified okay and so now both of these are verified and we should be all good so we can get rid of this we definitely don't want notifications and there is a desk type desktop app if you want to set that up but other than that you can now email and receive emails to your email address here okay now that we're we're back on the hosting dashboard and now we want to start making modifications to our website so there's a few ways to do it one of them is just to click on this admin pan panel here okay our website is published and it's going to give you a list of things that you can can do the first thing is upload your logo and then you'll notice here that we have an AI assistant which we'll talk about in a little bit but first of all let's actually do this and you can see that there is an AI logo maker so I'm going to go to the AI logo maker this is from hostinger and I am going to put the the website name which is coder stickers and I will put the brand description from before and just click Start creating and then we just see what type of logo do we want I'm going go with an abstract icon and then we can we have we start with one credit so you can generate a logo but I'm just going to use a logo I already have so after you have your logo we can just go to appearance customize and here is going to be the customizer to customize the page and it's going to kind of walk us through it through us here and when it says uh add your logo so let's do that right now so I'm going to select the logo okay and this is actually an AI generated logo and I'll just click select now it's kind of a busy logo I could have gone with something more simple but it's just up to you what you want and it's going to walk us through it's also going to walk us through how to customize the navigation menus and so you can see the navigation menus that we have right here home C check out now you can see this is very simple but we are going to um actually customize it to make it a little nicer and we're not going to go through all this stuff right now um we're actually going to come back later to do some of these you can choose your accent color your color your buttons and then you want to save and publish when you're when you're ready um we'll just save and publish this with our logo so then let's just kind of look at what the page looks like so far so you can see it says express your uh developer theme stickers from Cod stickers.com now un unfortunately when I put in the the description I put the URL wrong and it's supposed to be coders stickers.com but we can easily go in and update that stuff but one thing you can see is that this text is all just created uh by AI so uh we can see um there's basically different blog posts that's created for our our our uh store express yourself with developer theme stickers from codes stickers.com and then it gives a whole description of what's on the site express your coding Persona with whimsicle developer stickers and so it's going to create a a few different articles another one express yourself with wisle developer themed stickers so it looks like some of these articles have very similar titles and uh text but we can actually go through and easily update this so add a spark of creativity or workspace with code stickers express your coding personality with codee stickers so it has all these builtin articles that we can go through and update if we want right now let's look at how to more quickly update what this looks like so this is the homepage with a different blog post and we're going to be updating what all this looks like pretty soon here but we have the cart uh cart is currently empty checkout um where you can actually check out after you order something we haven't added any products yet though uh my account and Shop so shop there's no products but we're going to add some products now I'm back at the admin page and we are going to get to the AI system in a minute but let's do some basic things to make our website look a little better for now so I'm going to go to appearance and then I'm going to go to storefront now that is the name of our theme so if you use a different theme there may be a different way to customize it but since we're creating a store I'm going to customize it through this page here basically it's going to walk us through it so I'm going to go to let's go so now it's already going to uh make the page look a little different from before before it started with the blog now it's going to come right into this welcome page shop by category and you can see we have new in we recommend fan favorites uh but if we click here accessories it's going to have some products so these are just some sample products that we can and uh customize later basically now this store is looking a little better it's it's filled out a little bit and you can see what it's going to look like and right now there's just 12 sample products here but we are going to update all this so it can be customized for our our use so let's start customizing this a little further for one I think this is kind of a little too tall so I'm going to switch this out to a shorter version of this logo and we're going to put this whole big thing in the welcome page so let's see how we would do that I'm going to go to site identity and then change logo and then I'm just going to change to one I I basically use an image editing software to uh make get just the text and not the stuff inside the text so I'm going to also add an ALT text so I can put coder stickers logo and then hit select and then crop image okay and now we have this so it's not quite as tall okay now I'm going to add a site icon so do you remember in the full version there was like a computer with a little face in it so I'm going to use that as a site icon so I already cut out that picture but now I'm going to use this upscale program this is a free program for Mac OS and I think there is a Windows version too and I can just bring in this is that little face that I cut out and now I'm just going to upscale it and I have on the digital art setting and now you can see it's going to look a lot better now now we can get it to be the right um the right resolution of 512 x 512 and then I just use an image editing to get exactly 512 x 512 and then I can set the site icon and just bring it in here and then I'll put icon okay okay so we got the icon and now I can go back here and now we can go through if we want and update a lot of these things like the header image that be behind here we could update the the footer so that's what's down here like if I um change the background color to Yellow you can see it changes to Yellow well we we don't want to do that let's change it to the same yellow in this coder stickers logo so to get that that that color we're going to have to figure out the hex value if I click here um I I already got the hex value in my image editor program and then I can just paste it right in here so if we go down here now we have this as the same color in our logo and then you can see see we can go through and basically change any colors we want and then you can just keep customizing a few other things and then once you're done you can hit we can hit publish now I'm just going to actually just go copy this this website and go to the website so this is what it looks like so far so you can see now it's actually filling in all these things like the we recommend fam favorites on sale best sellers we're going to make some additional adjustments so let me go back here and then I hit X we'll go back over to here so if you want you can get some other designs and extensions like here we're not going to do it but if we click check them out we can see some other um other themes that we can get now some of them are going to cost money some of them are going to be free but like if I click here we can see this one is a free download for this theme we're just going to use the basic theme that we already have for now visit the site here and once so I already have had it open but I could also just click here visit site and then once I'm visiting the site let's see how we can edit this page well I'm just going to go different pages are edited in different ways but for this main page I'm going to just click edit page up here and then it's going to kind of tell you about the the block editor but I can kind of go over that so what I'm going to do is get rid of this heading um I'm going to actually just get rid of all this text and we are going to add some more text but first i'm going to um type slash and then we can add an image and we'll go to the media library we'll use this one that's already in our media library and then I'm going to make this a centered a line Center and we can change some settings about it so instead of it being so big we can go to medium we can go to thumbnail and I'm going to go to medium here and obviously this doesn't really look good on this other image so we're going to put a different image in the background and uh you can kind of do a mix of creating images with AI or we can go and get some royaltyfree images so I'm going to have the background image selected and I'm going to click replace and we'll do open media library and here instead of using this image I'm going to go to pixels which has some royaltyfree images there's a few pages for royaltyfree images or you can use an AI image generator so I'm going to say code background actually let's try software background okay I don't like these with chat GPT I can create an image so I'm going to say create a light colorful background image filled with software code now there's plenty of other image generators if you don't have access to Dolly 3 or chat GPT uh and you can also use the royaltyfree images okay I'm just going to go with this one so I'm going to download this image obviously you could spend more time on this if you wanted and then I'll upload the image and then I can make some adjustments like if I go to block um I can click here and now I can make it lighter I am going to make it lighter so then the logo will stand out a little more now we could spend a little more time making this match a little more but we'll just continue if you want when you're making your own store you can uh spend as much time as you want on making the different things look good actually we'll do one more thing we'll put in a heading here and I'll say heading now we'll just put our slogan which is going to be stick with code code with stickers and I'm also going to Center that now we can see that there's these short codes that can put in different things like uh the short code it's going to put in all the categories on top and then it's going to put in different products and these products see if I click on here it highlights this whole new product section and if I look over here it's going to say display a grid of your newest products so this section is always is going to show newest products this section is always going to show the handpick products display a selection of handpick products in the grid and fam favorites uh this is the ones that ra the the top now these are automatically generated based on the criteria um so if we go to we recommend you can choose what's going to show up do you want the the pro you can turn off product image um you can turn off product title takes a little bit to update but you can change the price you can turn on on and off the rating and stuff like this and then here here products here's where you can choose the products the you can see we have hoodie hoodie with pocket hoodie with zipper so the products can be chosen right here for what you recommend but then some of these are just developed automatically like fan favorites these are going to be automatically based on the rating and but there's an other settings you can do for each section and then you can choose the on sale products now personally I think this is too much so you don't need all these set these sections so I'm I'm going to get rid of some of them I'm going to get rid of on sale uh best sellers I can just basically delete it I'll I'll just keep fan I'll just keep the we recommend and fan favorites and then we also have no no we won't even have fan favorites we're trying to simplify this store and we're just going to have um new n and we recommend except I want to uh change the order of the SE so I want to get this we recommend above the the new end so see this I can select this section the we recommend section and then just do move up move up move up and then I have to go to the we recommend um you can obviously make changes to the font the style and every and the text so I'm going to just click up up up and now we're going to have shopy category we recommend and then the new n and you can also change what the the preview is this is like in Google if someone searches it will show this uh preview of what's going to be on the page and you can make updates to that you can make updates to the page title The Meta description and there's a bunch of things that you can uh change and you can see it also even gives you a page analysis so you can see the Met description is over 160 characters so if we change that I'm going to just delete that so let's try this description if we go down here we see that we have a good content length and then you can go through here and fix all these and we see we have some other problems we can go through each one and fix them I'm not going to take the time to do that right now but you can do that on your own okay I'm just going to click update and then we can view the page and now we can see the updated page and it's getting more customized okay let's customize it further we want to uh customize the links up here and we can see we actually do have the the blog here so you can see these blog posts and we're going to actually customize all these pages to make it work better for what we want first of all we want the shop to be the second link at their home it's the most important part since this is a shop so to update this menu here we're have to go back to the wp admin the WordPress admin page and then we're going to go to appearance and menus here I'm already on the menus page then we're going to create a new menu so I'll just put Main and then we will make this the primary menu and create menu and we these notifications we don't need to worry about that and now I can add items to the menu so for first going to add the shop top page and then we're going to add the cart checkout and let's just look at what's already on here we got cart checkout my account shop so we're going to basically add all those same things but just change the order so I'm also want the the blog page and I should have been clicking add to menu here okay so it's going to be the shop first then Blog then cart then checkout then my account and then I will save the menu now let's go to the page and I'll just refresh the page okay that works shop blog cart check out my account we don't have the main page anymore but that's okay CU when you click the logo here it should load the main page and most people are used to that so we have shop blog cart checkout main account great and actually I'm gonna go back to the main screen we go to get started and we're going to go to AI assistant so now we can see how we can create content with AI and it's going to be uh efor lent timesaving SEO friendly and so we can see what type of content do we need want to make a post a page a product so we can make all sorts of things with AI so um this this is going to be why Developers should put stickers on their laptops and we can change the tone neutral formal TR I'm going to change this to Friendly and witty and it'll make it long okay so now I'll just do generate content okay good we have an image and then we have the the article sticker up your laptop why developers should embrace the art of personalization as a developer your laptop is the most prized possession and then it talks about uh adding a touch of Personality we're talking about stickers and it gives all show off your interest Foster creative environment stand out from the crowd it's just plain fun so I'm just going to publish it we just now have a new article on our blog and I could have done edit as draft to personalize it but now we can see we have an article on our blog just like this and so here's the blog post we see this we see everything and people can even comment on it and log in and comment on it if we want to customize what these blog posts look like well one way to go about it is to click this edit post so edit post is is where we can actually edit the words we can say as a developer your laptop is your most important possession good now it's a now this is an article actually written by me since I put at least one word into it and you can change all these things and even has a page analysis here okay we know how to add a blog post now let's get to the real the real stuff of what this is this is a store so let's customize the shop specifically let's add new products we are going to add stickers that people can actually buy in real life so if we go back to our WordPress uh dashboard we go to products and then it's going to show all the products um so before we were just using these products as examples we don't want any of those products so I am going to select here and then I I'm just going to move to bin and apply so I just select all the products and I deleted all the products so now we we are just about to start adding new products but first we have to create the products so remember these are this is a a sticker store and we are going to use AI to create our sticker designs so for that we need an AI image generator there's a plenty of them out there like I've mentioned I'm going to use gbd4 with uh Dolly the beta version and if you don't have access to this version there's plenty of other ones you can use some of them are open source and you can run locally or on a website and this is what I'm going to do I'll say create some sticker designs for my sticker store here is the description of the store and I'll just put the description we made earlier welcome to coders stickers.com the premier Online Marketplace where every sticker tells a code story okay now I'm going to say create a few more but the website name should not be on them but some of these stickers I like I'm still going to use some of these uh this one I like so I'm going to download this one and this is interesting because uh I guess they're a bug I don't know what that's supposed to be but sure we're we're going to create that as a sticker and then this is going to be a sticker I'm going to just download that let's see what else it comes up with oh yeah this is I like that one nice okay and I'm actually going to take all these into an image editor to kind of cut them out to to process them better for our store now create a few more sticker designs for software Developers now uh let's I'm going to actually change the prompt now make a list of sticker design ideas for software developers then create the best ideas so we're going to see if it can create better stickers if it first creates the list okay let's look at these oh these are really cool actually I'm G to do that one that one actually I don't know if I can do this one because it's um it's kind of cut off on the edge uh but this one is also going to be a good one this is almost like a devops sticker now what I'm going to do I'm going to go into my image editor okay I'm using Affinity photo but you may be using Photoshop there's also canva and there's a lot of free online image editors you can use so you can basically do this in any image editor so what I'm going to do is uh basically delete all the parts that are not going to be in the sticker uh we want it to be uh transparent around the actual sticker so I'm going to select this I will um select this let's see if I change the tolerance that's too much so I deleted everything around but then I need to add some stuff back I'm I'm going to add a white outline okay now I just have to delete a few extra things here and then I'll crop the image so we can see we have the transparent stuff around the image and then we do have a white border around everything and then I'm going to save it and then I'll just start on another one this should be pretty easy to select out usually I like to put a white line around it but this one I'm not I'll just save it just like this and then another one and then I'll just do a few more off camera so I made a bunch of stickers and I want to make it so people can actually buy the stickers I found this website called printful there's a few other websites like this where they will print on demand uh this is not the only one you can use there's a few other ones but I'm actually going to create the stickers on printful and then add them to my WordPress site and then people will actually be able to order and then they will print them on demand so first I have to make a new product so if I go to product catalog um actually so if I go to product template I'll say create product and then I just go to stickers I can search for stickers and we want kiss cut stickers um mainly this is the cheapest type of stickers and a kiss cut sticker means it will be cut out along the edge of the sticker that's why we needed the transparency because uh the transparency is where it will be um cut off so I'm just going to drag my sticker design into here and I could add a few other different types of products but I'm not going to but we can see what it's going to look up look like I can click mockups and then you can see what it's going to look like on a a a computer or a car and you can see the transparency it doesn't become any part of the sticker so that's why we need to create that transparency okay so now that we have the sticker we can also choose what sizes we want I'll just keep all the sizes though I think the small sizes will will be better for the sticker and I'll just do save to templates and then I'm going to add the rest of the stickers just like that but we still see we have a a few of them here so I'm going to do add to store and I need to connect a store so let's just click connect store and then I'll go to choose platform and then I just want to find WordPress oh W commas it's right here so connecting to woocommerce and it's basically going to give instructions here but I'll just show you how to do it we're going to go back to our WordPress settings we go to Blue Commerce and then I'm going to go to settings if I go to Advanced and uh it's going to keep showing this this we can do this if we want but we're not going to connect but I'm going to go to um Legacy API and then enable the Legacy rest API so the next thing we need to do is make sure the Perman links are set up correctly so go to settings Pera links and then I'm going to swi switch it to post name so this is something we probably wanted to do anyways where the links uh in the the default was just going to be like P1 23 but now it's going to actually say the name of the post right in the URL which I think looks a little nicer and it's going to be better for SEO as well so I'm going to go to save changes for that and now we can see if the woocommerce API is working so to do that I'm going to go to the code stickers.com and I'm going to type in WC API that's woocommerce V1 and so now that we're getting this Json that means the API is working correctly okay now I'm going to go back to um plugins we haven't really talked too much about plugins but they can be used to add extra features to whoops they can be used to add extra features to your site and we talked about some of the default uh plugins that get installed we're going to install the printful plugin so I'm going to click add new and then I'll search and then install and then I have to activate it and now we'll have a new tab here the printful tab so let me click here and it says almost done just two more steps so I'm going to so I'm going to click connect follow link and I'm going to approve this now I just have to log in again and connect store okay now I'm just going to add product my product templates and I'm going to okay proceed to mockups and we'll just do basic mockups so we're going to do this mockup or just has the computer in the middle and then continue and we don't have to become a member that just gives us different rates so the retail price must be higher than the printful price okay now we can basically set the price so I'm just making it so they go at least a little more than the printful price I'm actually just going to make it so I make $1 for every sticker okay and submit to store make I know it's called Bubble free stickers but I want to change what the the title is so this is GNA be called coffee coding sticker I'm going to click where it says View and woo Commerce okay we have all the different uh computer mockups here and you can choose the size add to basket it and then we can then if we go to cart we can see that we have the sticker I'm going go over to printful and add some more now I'm just going to upload the rest of the images and create the rest of the products okay just added a bunch more stickers well not a bunch but a few extra and so you can all obviously customize what the images and what the mockups going to look like but now that they're all added I'm going to go to view in woo Commerce let's look at what our woocommerce store looks like I'm going to go right to the shop page and now we can see the the different stickers the Bas and Bug sticker bug catcher cod's art coffee coating sticker devops coaster sticker idea machine sticker uh USB tree I guess I forgot to type in sticker there uh so these are all the the stickers you can get in the shop and so if we go into one then we can select options so I'll just select the depending on on what you select it's going to uh change the size it's going to uh change the skew and it's going to make it look a different size on the the laptop mockup so if we go to 3x3 I can add that to basket and then go to the cart now we have the two things we have the coffee coating sticker we have the USB tree and then we'll just do proceed to check out so if if we look down here we can see it's just basically another a normal cart and uh there's a few things we can see one is that there are no available payment method so we have to set up the payment methods and the second thing is that I don't think I want to see these recent blog post on the side here so let's fix both of those things to remove this sidebar on the cart page and some other places um depending on what theme you have you can click customize and there for some themes there will be a way to customize it from in here however with this theme it's going to be a little trickier we have to go to our dashboard and we're going to actually have to edit a PHP file uh it's sounds kind of tricky but it's not as it's not not as hard as you would think we can go to appearance and then theme file editor and then click I understand now we are going to edit the functions.php file so I'm just going to scroll down to this bottom of this page and we're going to ignore where it says do not add Cod custom code here because we are going to add a custom code you just have to remember that if you update it's it's going to um remove it so you may have to add it again if you update so I'm just going to paste in some code here and this is the function remove storefront sidebar it's going to check if it's woocommerce or if it's the checkout then it's going to do a remove action and we have ADD action where it's going to this is where it's going to call the function remove storefront sidebar so I'm going to update that file now I just have to update one more file which is the CSS file so going to style. CS CSS and then I can just scroll to the bottom of this one and I'm going to add this I'm going to make the width 100% for by. woocommerce and body. woocommerce checkout and then I'll just hit update file and then if we go back back to our page and we go to the checkout page you can see we don't have the sidebar anymore here so here's the checkout page and you can see it says sorry it seems like there are no available payment methods please con so we basically have to add some payment methods that's that's going to be the next step here so I'm going to go to the dashboard and then I'm going to click on payments right here so we will install woo payments and you can see that there are no step costs or monthly fees it just takes a fee basically out of each sale that you make okay I'll just go through the setup process I decided not to show you that because there was a ton of personal information to get the payment set up that I don't want to share with with everybody but we got that set up and you can figure that out on your own if if you're doing the setup it's pretty straightforward and so it says congratulations your store has been verified so you can see that we are paying 27 cents per transaction Plus 2.61 or it normally be 30 cents per transaction I'm only making a dollar so that would be basically 70 cents per sticker we also have to make sure we set up our our shipping and taxes so to get our shipping set up I'm going to go to settings woocommerce settings and then I will go to ship to all countries you sell to I also want to enable tax ring calculations I might as well turn off the coupon codes right here and then I'm going to save changes and then go to shipping so I'm going to go to print full shipping enable this shipping method disable standard wo Commerce rates for products fulfilled by printful so we want to enable sh the shipping this shipping method the printful shipping method we want to disable standard woocommerce rat for products fulfilled by printful so printful is going to just handle all the shipping and then we are going to set which shipping methods we want printful use so we have to go to the printful tab here then I'll go to the settings tab and then I can allow printf to calculate the sales tax and I'll keep going down to these shipping methods so these are all the shipping methods that are offered from pimpl and I'm just going to keep all of these I mean I I could if I didn't want to offer some I could could take them off but those all look pretty good to me okay I'll save the changes because of the tax button I clicked here now let's go to the site look at the cart my cart's empty I'm going go to the shop and I'm going to choose this USB tree 3x3 actually I'll do the 4x4 I'll add the basket now I can go to the check out oh air missing or invalid printful store Key we have something not working for that so let me go to the dashboard again I did notice when I was in settings I'm going to try reconnecting the store okay now it's actually showing the shipping so I can click a flat rate so we're paying it's kind of an expensive sticker $3.40 for the sticker and then $3.99 for the shipping so it's it going to be a total of$ 783 okay sure and then I place my order and it says order received okay so let's see what the order looks like in the dashboard so I go to the dashboard and if we go to woocommerce and orders now you can see there's going to be two orders I tried an order before that didn't really work out be um so this is the the other order I made that I kind of messed up on so if we go to this order so hopefully this order will go through if we go back to printf and we go to orders hopefully we'll see the order that's going oh okay it says it's failed no billing method added okay I have to add a billing method because uh stripe took the money and then we have to send it over to print full so addit building method so I just set up the build method on printful and how it works is first the customer pays me and then I have to pay printful and then hopefully I make some sort of profit so the first money comes to me and then I pay printful based on the money that came to me so let me try just uh purchasing the sticker one more time so I'm going to click USB tree add the basket check out okay I've placed the order now I'm going to look at PRL again on the order dashboard if I refresh this okay it didn't fail it's it's waiting for fulfillment so this sticker is actually going to be sent to me it says orders waiting for fulfillment estimated fulfillment October 20th through 25th that means our store is pretty much done I me we can go through and customize things more so all that's left now is to add more products and use the AI tools to add more blog
