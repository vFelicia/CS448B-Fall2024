00:00 - all right this video we're going to talk
00:02 - about the profiles tab of chrome
00:04 - developer tools this is an awesome tab
00:06 - and an awesome tool it helps you really
00:08 - understand the execution time and memory
00:10 - usage of your whole web page or app
00:13 - so the way you can do it you can collect
00:15 - these profiles or snapshots you can do a
00:17 - javascript cpu profile which just goes
00:19 - through the execution time for the
00:21 - javascript the heap snapshot which is
00:24 - how the memory is distributed
00:26 - through your page's javascript object
00:28 - and dom nodes which is it describes to
00:30 - you on here and the record heap
00:32 - allocation so it's all the javascript
00:35 - options over time
00:37 - if there's a memory leak something's
00:39 - going on with memory leaks this heap
00:41 - allocation is a place to do that let's
00:43 - just start with the javascript profile
00:45 - we're going to start that
00:46 - let's refresh the page so it has some
00:48 - fun data to work with
00:50 - and we will stop
00:52 - it keeps the profile over here so let's
00:54 - do another one real quick i want to heap
00:55 - snap
00:56 - snapshot it does it just in a second
00:59 - it's a snapshot and then a heap
01:01 - allocation i'm going to start
01:03 - refresh the page
01:08 - and stop so i've got all i've got these
01:10 - three profile types they just took me a
01:12 - second
01:13 - so the profile one which is a cpu
01:15 - profile
01:16 - it
01:17 - sets you up with a lot of information
01:18 - just like all of these tabs if anything
01:20 - overwhelms me it's that there's so much
01:22 - data i just don't know what to do with
01:24 - it or when i need to look at it
01:26 - remember you're going to be using this
01:28 - when you're trying to figure out where
01:29 - memory is going and execution time but
01:31 - there's a lot of tabs that have to do
01:33 - with execution time this one is pretty
01:34 - specific for memory as well
01:37 - so you can look at this information a
01:39 - couple different ways in a chart
01:41 - which is a really nice graphical
01:43 - allocation if you had some data that
01:45 - took a little bit longer that might be
01:46 - more useful but again it's whatever
01:48 - works for you
01:49 - all right so let's look at it bottom up
01:51 - that's what works best for me but you've
01:52 - got to find what works best for you
01:54 - so let's see this has got
01:56 - a yellow exclamation point by it it's
01:59 - got a let's see what it says compile
02:01 - nodes
02:02 - okay so there's a lot going on here if
02:04 - we click this first one we can see what
02:06 - file it's in and where it's in the
02:07 - javascript exactly what's happening
02:09 - okay
02:11 - so here we go this is exactly what it
02:13 - was talking about
02:14 - when we were looking at the profile
02:16 - which i think is really cool so luckily
02:18 - here there was nothing that seemed to
02:20 - take a ton of time everything here seems
02:21 - to be running pretty smoothly but if
02:23 - that's not the case with your page and
02:25 - you're finding something taking a lot of
02:26 - memory this is where it will show up and
02:29 - you can find exactly where it is in your
02:31 - code that has the problem
02:33 - all these tools are meant to help you in
02:35 - the process of not only
02:37 - just developing from the beginning but
02:38 - maintaining your web page if something
02:40 - breaks if something starts to not act
02:42 - right it'll save you a lot of time just
02:44 - finding exactly what's wrong
02:47 - let's take a look real quick at these
02:48 - snapshots because it's a little bit
02:49 - different
02:51 - so this just says all the different
02:53 - elements that make up the document
02:55 - object model tree all the things that
02:57 - are in html css
03:00 - again so much information it's okay to
03:03 - not understand all ones i don't
03:04 - understand at all yet
03:06 - but knowing it's there and familiarizing
03:09 - yourself with the language that they're
03:10 - using and how you can organize the
03:12 - information when the time comes that you
03:14 - do need to use it you'll know where to
03:15 - look and you'll know what's possible
03:17 - with these tools

Cleaned transcript:

all right this video we're going to talk about the profiles tab of chrome developer tools this is an awesome tab and an awesome tool it helps you really understand the execution time and memory usage of your whole web page or app so the way you can do it you can collect these profiles or snapshots you can do a javascript cpu profile which just goes through the execution time for the javascript the heap snapshot which is how the memory is distributed through your page's javascript object and dom nodes which is it describes to you on here and the record heap allocation so it's all the javascript options over time if there's a memory leak something's going on with memory leaks this heap allocation is a place to do that let's just start with the javascript profile we're going to start that let's refresh the page so it has some fun data to work with and we will stop it keeps the profile over here so let's do another one real quick i want to heap snap snapshot it does it just in a second it's a snapshot and then a heap allocation i'm going to start refresh the page and stop so i've got all i've got these three profile types they just took me a second so the profile one which is a cpu profile it sets you up with a lot of information just like all of these tabs if anything overwhelms me it's that there's so much data i just don't know what to do with it or when i need to look at it remember you're going to be using this when you're trying to figure out where memory is going and execution time but there's a lot of tabs that have to do with execution time this one is pretty specific for memory as well so you can look at this information a couple different ways in a chart which is a really nice graphical allocation if you had some data that took a little bit longer that might be more useful but again it's whatever works for you all right so let's look at it bottom up that's what works best for me but you've got to find what works best for you so let's see this has got a yellow exclamation point by it it's got a let's see what it says compile nodes okay so there's a lot going on here if we click this first one we can see what file it's in and where it's in the javascript exactly what's happening okay so here we go this is exactly what it was talking about when we were looking at the profile which i think is really cool so luckily here there was nothing that seemed to take a ton of time everything here seems to be running pretty smoothly but if that's not the case with your page and you're finding something taking a lot of memory this is where it will show up and you can find exactly where it is in your code that has the problem all these tools are meant to help you in the process of not only just developing from the beginning but maintaining your web page if something breaks if something starts to not act right it'll save you a lot of time just finding exactly what's wrong let's take a look real quick at these snapshots because it's a little bit different so this just says all the different elements that make up the document object model tree all the things that are in html css again so much information it's okay to not understand all ones i don't understand at all yet but knowing it's there and familiarizing yourself with the language that they're using and how you can organize the information when the time comes that you do need to use it you'll know where to look and you'll know what's possible with these tools
