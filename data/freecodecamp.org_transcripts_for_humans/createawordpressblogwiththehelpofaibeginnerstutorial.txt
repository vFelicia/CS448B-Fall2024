00:27 - you can use to make a wide variety of
00:30 - websites and what you learn in this
00:31 - course will help you even if you don't
00:33 - want to make a Blog there's no coding
00:36 - whatsoever in the course you are going
00:38 - to create everything using a simple
00:40 - graphical interface I'm going to show
00:42 - you how to do the initial setup how to
00:45 - easily customize the site with templates
00:48 - how to create content quickly with AI
00:51 - and all the other things you need to
00:52 - know to use WordPress first I'm going to
00:55 - show you how to get your domain and
00:56 - hosting the primary expense is web
00:58 - hosting but everything else from the
01:00 - domain name to the WordPress platform
01:03 - and website templates is free while you
01:06 - usually have to pay for a domain many
01:08 - providers such as hostinger offer a free
01:10 - domain with certain hosting plans for
01:13 - those new to the blogging World think of
01:15 - the domain name as your website's
01:17 - address similar to youtube.com or freec
01:20 - camp.org web hosting on the other hand
01:23 - is like the land where you build a house
01:25 - it's where your website will live online
01:28 - it's where everything is stored well
01:30 - actually get the domain and hosting at
01:31 - the same place hostinger provided free
01:33 - Campa Grant to make this course possible
01:36 - and we'll use hostinger to get the
01:38 - domain name and hosting we'll be using
01:40 - them to create a managed WordPress
01:42 - website they offer premium features at
01:44 - an affordable price such as 247 customer
01:47 - support a free CDN a malware scanner and
01:50 - more I've actually used them in the past
01:53 - for my personal websites before we got
01:55 - this Grant and they make it super simple
01:57 - to set up a WordPress website but just
02:00 - you know almost everything I teach in
02:01 - this course will work with other hosting
02:04 - providers as well so go to hosting.com
02:06 - use the link in the description to get a
02:09 - better deal than you would normally get
02:11 - so let's see how to create a WordPress
02:13 - website with the help of AI now
02:17 - hostinger has a lot of built-in AI tools
02:20 - that makes things easier you can also
02:24 - use other AI tools such as chat gbt or
02:27 - Dolly but having it all everything
02:29 - included within hosting or just makes
02:31 - things a little simpler so we can see
02:34 - with this there's a few different plans
02:35 - you can choose from I would recommend
02:38 - the business plan because that is the
02:40 - one that's going to give you the
02:42 - WordPress AI tools we're not going to
02:44 - get that with the basic the Premium plan
02:47 - so I'm just going to go through and add
02:50 - this to
02:51 - cart and you can choose your period so
02:54 - the more months you buy at a time the
02:56 - cheaper it's going to be or you can just
02:59 - do a one month period if you just want
03:02 - to try it out I usually recommend doing
03:04 - at least 24 months when I'm going to
03:06 - create my own websites but it's up to
03:08 - you you may just want it for one month
03:10 - just to see how it works so we're just
03:13 - going to either log in or create our
03:16 - account and I've already bought my
03:18 - hosting plan so I'm not going to go
03:20 - through this right now but this is what
03:22 - you would have to do you're going to
03:23 - choose your payment method and then put
03:26 - all that in and then you're just going
03:27 - to do submit secure payment so after you
03:30 - get logged in or possibly during the
03:33 - account creation process you're going to
03:35 - have to claim a domain or get a domain
03:38 - you may already have a domain from
03:40 - another website you can use hostinger
03:43 - whether you purchase your domain name
03:45 - through hostinger or through another
03:47 - domain registr so I'm going to choose my
03:50 - domain now it could take a while to find
03:52 - a domain name that's not already taken
03:55 - but I was already doing some searching
03:57 - on what domain names are available and
03:58 - I'm going to go with python on playbook
04:01 - so hopefully this is still available yep
04:04 - I'm going to claim that domain you're
04:06 - going to have to put in contact
04:07 - information when you create a domain and
04:10 - some hosting providers will
04:13 - automatically hide that information from
04:16 - people that are searching it up some
04:18 - won't in hostinger all domains are going
04:21 - to have free who is privacy protection
04:25 - so that's nice um if you don't have that
04:28 - then all the contact information you put
04:31 - in when you're getting your domain will
04:32 - be available for anybody to see and
04:35 - you're going to get a bunch of calls and
04:38 - emails of people trying to sell you
04:39 - things for your new new domain and you
04:41 - probably don't want that so that's
04:43 - what's pretty cool about hostinger is
04:46 - that you get the free privacy protection
04:49 - so I'm just going to go to finish
04:50 - registration there's different ways to
04:52 - get into the hosting um I'm going to go
04:54 - to um skip because we're going to go
04:57 - back to home and I'm going to set up the
04:59 - business web hosting now depending on
05:02 - how you create your account there could
05:04 - be different ways to get into this setup
05:07 - so I'm going to be creating a Blog
05:09 - that's going to teach quick python tips
05:12 - and different just small nuggets of of
05:15 - knowledge of how to program in Python
05:18 - mainly because I have a lot of knowledge
05:19 - in that area so I might as well share
05:21 - the knowledge with others and I can
05:24 - easily use AI to help me create this
05:27 - content quickly so I'm going going to
05:30 - just go through
05:32 - this I'm going to create a
05:35 - website and here you're going to have to
05:37 - choose if you want to create a website
05:39 - WordPress with AI or the hosting or
05:42 - website builder now the hosting website
05:45 - builder is best for absolute beginners
05:49 - and the WordPress with the AI is still
05:51 - good for beginners but but it's going to
05:54 - be slight it's going to give you
05:55 - slightly more features which means it's
05:57 - going to be slightly more complicated
05:58 - and you're going to have a little more
05:59 - power over your website and it's better
06:02 - for people to have a little a little
06:04 - more knowledge so the hosting website
06:06 - builder uses customizable templates to
06:08 - simplify the website building process
06:10 - and they're all pre-made website designs
06:12 - that include images layouts and texts
06:16 - and then WordPress is is going to use
06:18 - themes alter the web appearance and the
06:21 - theme is a package of pre-made templates
06:24 - website elements and customization tools
06:26 - so we want to have a little more control
06:29 - so we're going to do WordPress with AI
06:31 - but if you want it to be even simpler
06:34 - you can click website the hosting or
06:36 - website builder so create with WordPress
06:39 - and then you're going to want to create
06:41 - a password that it's going to this email
06:43 - and password will be used to log into
06:46 - the WordPress account so you have one
06:48 - set of login details for hostinger and
06:50 - another set of login details for the
06:52 - WordPress account and I'm going to
06:55 - choose a Blog now everything I'm talking
06:57 - about in this tutorial will be relevant
06:59 - to creating an online store as well so
07:01 - you can also choose that if you want the
07:02 - online store so now we're choosing
07:05 - between pre-built templates or standard
07:07 - themes it's pretty self-explanatory the
07:10 - pre-built templat is going to have
07:11 - things more already created for you and
07:15 - the standard themes are you're going to
07:17 - have to customize it a little more so if
07:20 - you're really into customizing to
07:22 - standard themes we're going to go with
07:23 - pre-built templates to simplify the
07:25 - process and get our blog running as
07:27 - quick as possible so I'm going to choose
07:29 - one of these templates now again we can
07:32 - go back to standard themes if we want to
07:33 - have a little more flexibility and we
07:36 - can also preview these like I'm going to
07:37 - preview this one and you can see it's
07:40 - powered by Astro which is a common
07:43 - WordPress theme or template now since
07:46 - I'm making a website about python tips
07:50 - and python tutorials I think it's more
07:52 - similar to this child care blog there's
07:54 - not going to be videos but uh just how a
07:56 - childcare blog would have different lots
07:58 - of different blog posts about raising
07:59 - children this one's going to have a lot
08:01 - of different blog posts teaching how to
08:04 - work with python so I'm going to select
08:06 - this and then I'm just trying to make
08:08 - this as quick and easy as possible so
08:10 - you can either select all the plugins
08:12 - you want manually or use the
08:15 - pre-selected plugins so I'm just going
08:17 - to use the pre-selected plugins we can
08:20 - also always change these later if we
08:22 - want and this is where the AI is going
08:24 - to start helping us do you want to
08:26 - generate blog content with AI we just
08:28 - have to enter some information about the
08:30 - website and the description and the AI
08:32 - will start generating original content
08:35 - tailored for
08:36 - us and here's my description welcome to
08:40 - python Playbook your go-to spot for
08:42 - diving into the world of Python
08:43 - Programming with a Twist of humor
08:45 - whether you're just starting out or
08:47 - looking to brush up on your skills our
08:48 - blog makes learning python not only easy
08:50 - but entertaining we break down complex
08:52 - Concepts into simple digestible
08:54 - analogies and sprinkle in a healthy dose
08:56 - of laughs to keep things light and fun
08:58 - so I won't keep bring the rest but the
09:00 - more details you add the better and the
09:03 - more the AI will have to work with when
09:05 - creating the content so I'm just going
09:07 - to go with next and then we select the
09:10 - domain name and we can select where
09:13 - we're going to be based out of I think
09:15 - there'll be a lot of people the there's
09:17 - actually more people in the United
09:18 - States on the left side of the United
09:20 - States or the the west side so I'm going
09:22 - to go with Arizona okay after the
09:25 - website's created we'll be put into this
09:28 - dashboard and so so let's just do some
09:30 - basic things first so let's preview the
09:33 - website I'll actually click on this to
09:34 - open up the website in a new tab and you
09:37 - can see it's using the child care theme
09:39 - that we chose now obviously we're going
09:41 - to be going through and updating this in
09:43 - a moment here but if we go to blog you
09:46 - can see that we already have some blog
09:48 - entries now it's going to give us the
09:52 - child care examples and then the python
09:55 - examples now these all look to be about
09:57 - the same these aren't exactly what we
10:00 - want for articles these articles are
10:02 - going to introduce people to the website
10:06 - welcome to python Playbook and then you
10:09 - can see it gives information about what
10:11 - the website's going to be about and
10:13 - later I'll show you how to use AI to
10:16 - create some more blog entries so I'm
10:19 - going to close that for now and before
10:23 - we start customizing the website I'm
10:26 - going to set up the free email
10:32 - after the email is set up we can click
10:34 - manage and then we can choose the email
10:37 - plan I'm just going to go with the free
10:39 - one and then we choose our email address
10:42 - and our password and then create and
10:45 - then we can access the email through the
10:47 - browser or actually apps on our computer
10:50 - the simplest is just using our browser
10:53 - and then I can click webmail
10:59 - and now I can email people through this
11:02 - or I can receive emails right to this
11:05 - email address and there's also a way to
11:08 - set it up to forward to a different
11:10 - account if you don't want to use this
11:12 - web interface and if you want to check
11:13 - all of your emails from the same account
11:15 - but that's beyond the scope of this
11:17 - tutorial so I'm just going to close this
11:19 - because I'm not going to write an email
11:21 - right now and I'll click
11:23 - complete and we also want to make sure
11:25 - the DKI is set up correctly
11:30 - this can it says right here prevent
11:32 - spoofing and fishing and makes emails
11:34 - less likely to be marked as
11:37 - spam so I just go to generate here and
11:42 - then it says to verify the DKI record
11:44 - add this txt record to your DNS Zone it
11:47 - can take up to six hours for the
11:48 - verification to be
11:50 - finished so what I'm going to do I'm
11:52 - going to keep this page open and I'm
11:54 - going to open a new tab with
11:57 - hosting and then manage the hosting and
12:00 - actually I'm supposed to be on domains
12:02 - domains and then manage the
12:05 - domain and then go to DNS name
12:09 - servers and here is where I'm going to
12:12 - add a record so I'm going to go to
12:16 - txt and then for the name that's the
12:19 - host so I'm going to copy that and paste
12:23 - in this name and then for the txt value
12:28 - is going to be this second one and I'll
12:32 - paste that into here and then I'll just
12:34 - push add
12:37 - record okay so we added this record here
12:41 - and I can just go and say I have added
12:43 - the dkim record in my DNS zone now that
12:47 - will just make our emails be less likely
12:50 - to be marked as spam when we send from
12:52 - this email address okay let's go back to
12:55 - our websites and then manage and then
12:59 - we're back to the admin panel here and
13:02 - so we can also make change on some other
13:04 - things like the backups um you can see
13:07 - there's other things we can do on this
13:10 - main page here but we really want to go
13:12 - to the WordPress admin panel that's
13:15 - where we're going to go to make all of
13:17 - our
13:18 - changes now WordPress on hostinger is
13:22 - very similar to Wordpress on a lot of
13:25 - other hosting providers so like I said
13:28 - earlier you can follow along even if
13:30 - you're not using hostinger hostinger
13:32 - just provides some AI tools that are
13:35 - going to make things a little simpler so
13:37 - we're going to start by just going
13:40 - through the steps here we're going to
13:43 - start by creating a logo and hostinger
13:47 - has this really cool AI logo maker to
13:50 - make things even easier so I'm going to
13:53 - go to the AI logo maker and then I'll
13:55 - get logged in and you can see we default
13:59 - with one credit to make a logo but you
14:01 - can also buy more if you want more logos
14:03 - or you can create your logo using a
14:06 - different tool you don't have to use the
14:07 - AI logo maker so I said just logo for
14:10 - blog with quick Python programming
14:12 - tutorials and you can choose the style
14:15 - that you want want I'm going to stay on
14:18 - abstract and see what
14:24 - happens so we can use one of these or
14:27 - just create our own so we also have the
14:29 - ability to edit the logo we can download
14:32 - so I'm going to download this one and
14:35 - the editing that you can do within this
14:37 - program is kind of limited but you can
14:40 - also always just bring in these Graphics
14:42 - into your own image editor if you want
14:44 - to make it more detailed so I can just
14:48 - close this tab and then it's going to
14:50 - show how we can finish uploading our
14:53 - logo okay now we just have to go to the
14:55 - customize page and upload the logo so
14:59 - we'll go to take me there and then we'll
15:01 - go to site identity and then site title
15:04 - and Logo
15:07 - settings and then I'll just select the
15:09 - logo I actually made a different logo
15:11 - and didn't use the AI options we were
15:13 - seeing earlier so I'll just hit
15:17 - select okay so it's like the python logo
15:20 - and it kind of has the Playbook like a a
15:22 - sports Playbook on there so I thought
15:25 - that was kind of cool okay and I also
15:27 - want to use a site icon this is what's
15:31 - going to appear right uh in the right in
15:35 - the browser next at the very top there's
15:38 - always an icon next to the name here
15:41 - so I'm going to select the icon and it
15:44 - says suggested 512 x 512
15:47 - pixels which is actually what this logo
15:50 - already is 512 x 512 so I'll select
15:56 - that and then now you can see already
15:59 - right in the top here so that's pretty
16:01 - cool and now we're going to go through
16:03 - and just update the design so it fits
16:06 - more with what we want and then I will
16:08 - show you how to use the AI to make more
16:10 - blog
16:11 - entries so first I'm going to go into
16:14 - Global here and we can change all these
16:17 - different settings so I could change the
16:20 - typography I'm going to keep the
16:22 - typography the same but I do want to
16:24 - change the colors so right now we see
16:27 - the this blue blue purple black gray
16:30 - white and you can see everything uses
16:32 - those colors so um this color this wiish
16:37 - is actually here and then we have the
16:40 - colors of the text and if we see these
16:43 - buttons that blue in this buttons when I
16:45 - hover over view all articles is the same
16:47 - blue right here so I'm going to go
16:49 - through and change this to some
16:51 - different colors that align with my
16:53 - brand better so we could go through and
16:56 - select one of these presets here but I'm
16:59 - going to manually change the color here
17:01 - and I want this green that's in the logo
17:03 - I want that to be the accent and the
17:06 - links so I'll just click here and then
17:09 - if I scroll down I can actually enter a
17:11 - hex value right
17:13 - here so I'm going to paste the color hex
17:15 - value I got from my image editing
17:18 - software and then I can change this to
17:21 - be the same
17:26 - one and then I'll also change this color
17:29 - up here so any time I see this blue I'll
17:32 - change that okay now if I scroll down we
17:36 - can see that we're using we're seeing
17:38 - the Green in the different part of the
17:43 - page now I still have to figure out
17:45 - sometimes the color the changing the
17:47 - colors will be in different spots you'll
17:49 - see when I hover over this it becomes
17:51 - blue when I hover over this becomes
17:54 - green I don't want to become blue when I
17:56 - hover over I want to become dark green
17:58 - something you just have to kind of mess
18:00 - around a little bit cuz it's not
18:02 - immediately obvious which color goes to
18:05 - which thing but I see this blue here so
18:08 - I'm going to first put on my hex value
18:10 - and then I'm just going to use this to
18:11 - make it a little darker just like
18:15 - that okay and now when I hover over the
18:18 - button it goes to dark green instead of
18:20 - dark blue great now I'm going to change
18:23 - a few more things I see these a see
18:25 - these lines here um I see it's the same
18:28 - color this so I'm going to change color
18:31 - seven this time I'm just going to change
18:33 - it myself I kind of want it to be um a
18:38 - yellowish color maybe a little lighter
18:40 - than
18:45 - that okay so now we have these lines are
18:49 - yellow so you can just go around and
18:51 - experiment until you change the colors
18:53 - of everything that you want to
18:56 - change and the rest of the colors look
18:59 - good this you can still see the blue
19:02 - right here but that's just an image that
19:05 - we can change so first before I go out
19:08 - of this I want to hit
19:09 - publish and then I can hit X to go out
19:12 - of this screen
19:13 - here and if I
19:16 - refresh we should be able to see the
19:19 - changes so we can see what the page
19:20 - looks like with those
19:24 - changes okay I'm going to go back into
19:26 - customize now
19:29 - and then if we go into the global
19:31 - section we can still change a few more
19:34 - things like if we go into buttons we can
19:37 - change what the buttons looks like you
19:39 - can see it brings in the colors from
19:41 - before that's pretty nice but for the
19:44 - most part I like all the button stuff so
19:46 - you can go through and and change global
19:48 - settings but we're going to come back
19:50 - over here you can go through and change
19:53 - things in any of these categories we're
19:55 - going to go we're going to go into more
19:57 - of those in a little bit
19:59 - but let's see how we can change our main
20:01 - page here so right now we're just
20:03 - customizing the look of things we cannot
20:06 - actually customize the text on here so
20:09 - I'm just going to hit publish to make
20:12 - sure it saves everything I've done I can
20:15 - hit X here and now before we we're on
20:19 - customize but now we're going to go to
20:21 - edit
20:26 - page so you can see it takes us into
20:29 - this other editor here welcome to the
20:31 - block editor and it just talks about how
20:33 - each section is a different block of
20:36 - content and then you can basically edit
20:39 - different blocks however you want and
20:42 - you should look at the Block Library see
20:44 - what you can add okay so what we're
20:46 - going to do is just start making some
20:48 - changes here so instead of Welcome to
20:51 - bua I just can just double click and I
20:54 - could really change anything I could
20:55 - change the font the text size
20:59 - anything like that but I'm just going to
21:01 - change the text
21:03 - to python
21:09 - Playbook since we want the site to have
21:13 - funny entertaining posts we're going to
21:15 - use a slogan
21:18 - python
21:19 - made
21:22 - playful and again if we want to change
21:24 - anything we could like we can make it
21:26 - bold
21:29 - italic we can copy the format and
21:33 - there's all sorts of different ways we
21:35 - can change what the text looks
21:38 - like now for some of the texts on the
21:40 - page we're going to try using the ask AI
21:44 - feature now there's different types of
21:47 - AI that we'll be talking about some of
21:50 - the AI is created right from hostinger
21:53 - this is a different service that you can
21:55 - use but we're just going to get signed
21:58 - up for for this with 1,000 free
22:03 - credits okay I just created an account
22:05 - really quick and I just have to connect
22:06 - it and we can see we have we've used
22:09 - zero of 1,000 usages so let me come back
22:13 - over here let me just refresh to make
22:15 - sure it loads now that we've logged into
22:18 - the other website to save it I'm going
22:21 - to click
22:22 - update and then I'll refresh
22:26 - here okay I'm going to hit ask ask AI
22:29 - here and you can see we also have ask AI
22:32 - down here this is for when you want to
22:36 - ask questions about WordPress or we can
22:39 - click ask AI here if we want to help
22:43 - make text uh fix grammar change tone
22:46 - make larger make
22:47 - [Music]
22:50 - shorter write a one sentence description
22:52 - on my blog where post short humorous
22:54 - python
22:56 - tutorials and we can use this or we can
22:59 - just click refresh and we'll try writing
23:02 - it one more
23:03 - time okay I'm just click use this and
23:06 - now it replaces the text with this new
23:10 - text now let's just keep scrolling down
23:12 - and see what else we want to change well
23:16 - are we could actually change put some
23:18 - new logos here of where we've been
23:20 - featured but we haven't been featured
23:21 - anywhere so I'm going to actually take
23:23 - out this whole section so I'm going to
23:25 - click in here and then I'm going going
23:29 - to go to delete so we delete that
23:32 - section going to delete this
23:35 - section and we don't need a contact page
23:38 - right now so I can delete this
23:40 - section okay and the only other thing to
23:42 - fix in here is this background image so
23:45 - this background image obviously does not
23:47 - go with our
23:48 - website so to change this image you're
23:51 - going to make sure the the setting tab
23:53 - is open here and then you can kind of
23:55 - just go around to see different things
23:58 - you want to change well we're going to
23:59 - change the image but you can also change
24:01 - different things such as the the
24:04 - position you can change the width of
24:07 - things the minimum height how high
24:09 - actually I'm going to make it so it's
24:10 - not quite as high and for the
24:14 - width go to about there but let's go and
24:17 - change the image so I'm just going to
24:19 - click change image so I'm just going to
24:22 - upload a new file here and this is a
24:24 - file I just made for the website I
24:27 - basically made a hello world program
24:29 - that was as complicated as possible and
24:32 - then I'm going to use that as kind of uh
24:36 - an image that's going to be in the
24:38 - corner there so I can specify the alt
24:41 - text so I'm going to do hello
24:45 - world and then I'll select
24:48 - that okay so now um it just has this
24:51 - hello world I I made this curve here so
24:54 - it kind of be similar to the other image
24:58 - uh it looks like you can you can see
25:00 - this like we could change the size the
25:02 - color of this text or we could change
25:03 - this green if it was going to be hard to
25:05 - read but I think people will be able to
25:07 - read that so since this is mainly a Blog
25:10 - I mean we could make a section that
25:12 - talks about me the creator of the blog
25:14 - but I'll just skip that so I'm going to
25:17 - delete this whole block so you can see
25:19 - when you move your mouse around you can
25:21 - see a blue line that goes around
25:23 - whatever section you're on so I want to
25:25 - go onto this section you can see the
25:27 - blue line on the corner here and then I
25:29 - can go to delete right under this we
25:32 - have featured articles which we want to
25:36 - keep and then Learn Python quickly
25:39 - instead of Articles I'm actually going
25:40 - to call these
25:41 - tutorials and then where it says view
25:43 - all articles I'm going to change this to
25:46 - tutorial so these articles we will
25:49 - update later so if you keep scrolling
25:52 - down we can see see where's this child
25:55 - care topics the child care block if you
25:57 - see these blue Lin inside this other
25:59 - bigger block and the other bigger block
26:01 - also has um what they say and it has
26:05 - meet the experts so these are all things
26:07 - we can update it's very easy to update
26:09 - like if I wanted to update this expert
26:11 - with a different picture I could just go
26:13 - to replace
26:16 - upload and then just bring in a picture
26:18 - of me here and it would be easy to just
26:21 - update this name bo KS and then the
26:25 - social media links you may not want all
26:27 - of them like I could delete this one so
26:30 - pretty much all of this stuff can be
26:32 - edited but I am just going to remove
26:35 - this section because I don't want any of
26:38 - this so I'm going to go to
26:43 - delete but let's say we wanted to add a
26:45 - new section I'm going to get to this
26:47 - stuff down here in a second so if I want
26:49 - to add a new section I'm going to go up
26:51 - here it says toggle block
26:54 - inserter and then we're going to decide
26:57 - what type of block we want to add so I'm
27:01 - going to add a container go down to the
27:04 - bottom we can see what we decide what
27:07 - layout we want so I'm going to do this
27:10 - this layout that has the three different
27:16 - sections and then we can add a block to
27:19 - each of these sections like for instance
27:22 - maybe I want to add a map in the first
27:24 - section so the first section could be a
27:26 - map and then and then the second section
27:30 - go to browse all again let's say we want
27:32 - a
27:34 - video and the final section let's say we
27:37 - just want an image so each of these
27:40 - things we added we can customize and you
27:43 - can see over on the side we we can
27:46 - change like we can change the
27:48 - zoom we can change the height we can
27:52 - select the address like I can
27:55 - say so now we're the map is of Los
27:58 - Angeles California and I could zoom in
28:01 - further on there and then for YouTube I
28:05 - can just put the URL to embed a video
28:08 - and it's a WordPress tutorial that I
28:10 - created and then for image it's just
28:12 - like before you can upload or choose an
28:15 - image from the media library I'm just
28:18 - going to choose this one that's already
28:19 - in there so basically with adding
28:22 - different blocks you can customize the
28:24 - page how you like but I'm just going to
28:27 - actually delete the this whole thing I
28:28 - don't need
28:30 - this and I am going to update the page
28:33 - and we're just going to see what the
28:35 - page looks like for
28:37 - now so go to view page oh we can see
28:41 - there are some things on the page that
28:42 - we didn't see before because we edit
28:44 - those in a different place um but we can
28:47 - go down we see featured tutorials Learn
28:50 - Python quickly now later we're going to
28:52 - update those with the and then we also
28:55 - have some things that we still have to
28:56 - get to to learn how to update like the
28:59 - subscribe to our newsletter and some of
29:02 - the stuff we still have to update the
29:03 - logo there So eventually we're going to
29:05 - get to using the AI to write some
29:06 - articles for us but let's work on
29:08 - updating this menu here changing this
29:12 - button right here and then also updating
29:16 - the footer so first let's look at the
29:19 - header so first let's just see what's we
29:21 - have here so we have the blog which we
29:23 - do need to update we have the babies Tab
29:27 - and the sensory Play tab and both these
29:30 - just have the same article here and then
29:32 - we have the contact page so for our
29:35 - website we just want the home we want
29:38 - blog but want that to be called articles
29:40 - and then we want the contact page we
29:43 - don't need these other Pages for what
29:45 - we're trying to do later if we want to
29:48 - add a section for different types of
29:50 - programming languages we can so I'm
29:53 - going to go back to the dashboard and
29:55 - this is could be the first time we're
29:57 - seeing the homepage of the dashboard and
29:58 - some of these things we can get rid of
30:00 - like we'll just dismiss some of these
30:02 - things and then what remember we're
30:04 - trying to update the header so I'm going
30:06 - to go to appearance and then menus so to
30:09 - update this top menu I'm going to go
30:11 - back to
30:13 - customize and then if I scroll down we
30:16 - have menus and then we see there's a few
30:19 - different menus but I'm going to go to
30:20 - the header menu and see it says home
30:23 - blog baby sensory play contact that's
30:25 - all we have up here well I'm going to to
30:28 - get rid of some of these so sensory play
30:30 - I'll remove babies I'll remove and then
30:34 - blog we're going to change this to
30:38 - articles okay so now we have home
30:40 - articles
30:41 - contact and then to get rid of this
30:44 - appointment button I'm going to go
30:47 - to header Builder and then it has the
30:51 - all the elements in the header and you
30:53 - can actually see it right down here so
30:56 - we have the site title and logo
30:58 - we have the primary menu and we have the
31:00 - button over here so I can just click
31:03 - remove element to remove that
31:07 - button okay now just click
31:09 - publish and then we have that done I'm
31:12 - going to go down to the bottom and let's
31:14 - update this stuff we do want a
31:17 - newsletter so I'm just going to click
31:19 - this edit button and will take us right
31:21 - to what we want to change here and it's
31:25 - this section is called the above footer
31:28 - so there's a few different sections we
31:30 - can see them down here so this copyright
31:32 - section that's right here this where it
31:34 - says Power by Pyon Playbook that's this
31:37 - and then we can see all these widgets
31:40 - here are in this footer right here and
31:43 - then this top one right here is this
31:45 - this widget right here so I'm just going
31:47 - to click edit so I'm going to click this
31:51 - settings
31:53 - button and then here's where I can make
31:56 - some changes so I'm going to say get
32:00 - python tips in your email so if I select
32:04 - this form and go to show more settings
32:08 - we can see more information about the
32:11 - form so once you submit it it's going to
32:14 - say the form has been submitted
32:15 - successfully and you can change what it
32:17 - says you can change what the error
32:19 - message is there's just a bunch of
32:21 - things you can change on it and then
32:24 - later we'll see where we where all the
32:25 - information comes in but we got that how
32:28 - we want it and now
32:30 - let's update some of these things well
32:34 - this add widget add widget um we don't
32:36 - need any extra widgets right now so
32:38 - we'll remove those and we do want to
32:40 - change this logo here so I clicked where
32:43 - it says hl1 now this logo I'm just going
32:47 - to delete it and now I can insert an
32:56 - image and I can resize it it's just
32:59 - going to say the best place to Learn
33:02 - Python and as I think about this I just
33:04 - want this stuff to be in the middle I'm
33:07 - going to make sure to Center
33:09 - this I'm going to remove this widget and
33:12 - then I can just move this to the middle
33:16 - and then move the social tags to the
33:23 - middle and then we could just do some
33:26 - modifications like we can
33:30 - change I can change the YouTube url I
33:33 - can change the Twitter
33:37 - URL and then I can just delete anything
33:39 - that I don't
33:43 - want okay then final thing I forgot to
33:46 - change the background for this subscribe
33:48 - to our newsletter cuz these colors are
33:49 - not the colors we're using so to moove
33:52 - this background and to change it I'm
33:54 - going to click the edit here go to
33:59 - design background remove the
34:02 - image I'm actually going to set it to a
34:05 - color a
34:07 - gradient okay I'm going to click publish
34:10 - and then let's see what the website
34:12 - looks
34:13 - like no for some reason it didn't save
34:16 - the text here so let's go to
34:19 - footer widget
34:26 - one looks good so let's see how to
34:29 - create articles I'm going have to go
34:32 - back to the dashboard and then if I go
34:35 - to
34:36 - posts I can see all the posts we
34:39 - currently
34:40 - have and I'm just going to delete most
34:44 - of these except one that is the one that
34:47 - we create with AI to describe what the
34:51 - website is like so I'll just do bulk
34:54 - action move to trash and apply
35:00 - why so now if we go back here to the
35:03 - Articles and if I
35:05 - refresh we should just see one
35:09 - article and if you go read more see the
35:12 - whole thing but we want to create a few
35:15 - more
35:16 - articles so there's a few ways to do it
35:19 - on this page I could click new post or
35:24 - on the post page I can do add new post
35:30 - post so I can create the title and then
35:33 - I would just start typing the post here
35:36 - and then I could add blocks I can add
35:38 - images or anything like that this is how
35:41 - you create the post if you're going to
35:42 - Rite it yourself but if you want to use
35:44 - the AI tools to to write
35:47 - it I'm going I can going to leave this
35:49 - page and go to the main admin dashboard
35:54 - and then I'm going to hover over hope
35:58 - hostinger and then AI content creator
36:01 - and here we can create as much AI
36:05 - content as we want earlier I was showing
36:08 - you Spectra and this only gives you a
36:10 - certain number of credits and then you
36:11 - have to buy more but with the hosting or
36:14 - AI content creator it's actually
36:16 - separate you can make as many as you
36:19 - want so we can either create a post
36:22 - that's like the article or a page a page
36:25 - is like the homepage the contact page
36:27 - page or a page is generally something
36:29 - that's a permanent main part of your
36:32 - website a post is like an article or
36:35 - blog
36:38 - post so I'm going to use a witty tone
36:43 - length I'll say long it says usually use
36:46 - to make high ranked articles that will
36:48 - generate more leads and then what your
36:51 - contact about this article is about the
36:54 - basics of the Python programming
36:57 - language
36:58 - and I can do keywords or the AI can
37:00 - automatically generate the keyword
37:02 - suggestion so I'll just click generate
37:10 - content okay so this will create an AI
37:13 - generated image for the article and we
37:16 - can either set it as the featured image
37:19 - as we can set the featured image as home
37:22 - and we can either set this as the
37:24 - featured image as a thumbnail or insert
37:27 - the image inside the content I'm going
37:28 - to set as the thumbnail and then it
37:32 - basically gives an article about python
37:35 - the basics of python and so it's going
37:38 - to give some of the history of python
37:40 - some reasons why to Learn Python and
37:43 - down here uh it gives a bold list of all
37:46 - the different reasons to Learn Python
37:48 - and then getting started with python
37:50 - talks about installing python setting up
37:52 - an IDE writing it first program object
37:55 - oriented programming so this has a lot
37:58 - of features in this article so I'm just
38:00 - going to
38:01 - click
38:05 - publish so let's create a few more
38:07 - articles about python so go back to the
38:10 - dashboard
38:12 - hostinger AI content
38:14 - [Music]
38:15 - creator and this time I'm going to say
38:17 - it's a it's going to be a funny article
38:20 - a humorous tutorial about if statements
38:22 - in Python
38:27 - okay that's an interesting uh photo but
38:30 - we'll go with it the Wacky World of if
38:33 - statements a hilariously informative
38:35 - python Journey now one thing about some
38:38 - AI generated articles is that there are
38:40 - certain words that will really give it
38:44 - away that's AI generated two of them are
38:46 - in this first sentence I've never seen
38:48 - them so close together but delve and
38:51 - intricacies articles that use the word
38:53 - delve and intri intricacies a lot uh
38:56 - it's generally give away that it's AI
38:58 - generated but one thing cool is that the
39:00 - code even is kind of like in a code
39:03 - block here and overall actually this
39:05 - article is pretty good it's giving a lot
39:07 - of different examples and this time I'm
39:09 - going to edit it as a draft instead of
39:12 - publishing
39:13 - it so I'm just going to call it the
39:16 - Wacky World of if statements and then
39:19 - I'm going to say
39:21 - before we talk about if statements
39:27 - now it's my own article kind of it's
39:30 - it's at least not so obvious right away
39:32 - that it's AI generated okay before I
39:35 - publish this one I'll actually talk
39:36 - about this you've probably seen this at
39:38 - the bottom of all the pages and articles
39:41 - this is all stuff to help with SEO so
39:44 - it's going to show what it's going to
39:46 - look like in a search engine and then
39:50 - you can make changes to what the post
39:52 - title is going to be so this title you
39:55 - can see right here the it has the post
39:58 - title the separator was is this Dash and
40:00 - then the site title Python playbook.com
40:03 - and then for The Meta description um
40:06 - that's what's right here it's just going
40:08 - to be an excerpt from the post if you
40:10 - don't want this post excerpt we can just
40:13 - say an
40:15 - article about if statements and you can
40:19 - see how it it changes right up here and
40:22 - then there's just some different things
40:24 - about SEO like this is going to just
40:26 - give you some some tips for improving
40:29 - SEO we need we should have a longer
40:31 - metad description that's I mean this is
40:33 - pretty short here so we could make that
40:35 - longer there's no internal links so we
40:37 - may want to add links there's no
40:39 - external links so we may want to add
40:40 - external links and all that will make
40:43 - things better and
40:45 - readability we see that there's not a
40:48 - lot of images or
40:50 - videos
40:51 - it's uses a lot of passive
40:54 - voice and
40:58 - that doesn't have good subheading
41:00 - distribution so we could go through and
41:02 - update those if we want better SEO but
41:05 - for now I'm just going to publish the
41:07 - article and then we click publish here
41:10 - and let's just make a few more
41:13 - articles so I'm going to go to the AI
41:15 - content creator again and this time I'm
41:19 - going to create a short post because one
41:23 - of the ideas behind our blog are is
41:26 - short articles about
41:28 - python write a humorous tutorial about
41:30 - variables in
41:36 - Python okay the AI generated image is
41:38 - the same so I guess it may be AI Chosen
41:42 - and not actually generated but it's
41:44 - still a pretty good image for the
41:45 - article and one thing you can do if you
41:48 - look at it and it's not exactly what you
41:49 - want you can make some changes so I'm
41:53 - going to say with a lot of code
42:06 - examples okay this is a lot better and I
42:09 - like that there's some code examples so
42:11 - I'm just going to publish
42:16 - this and we'll do one more write a
42:19 - humorous tutorial about loops in Python
42:21 - with many code
42:25 - examples and I'll edit this so I can
42:27 - insert another image just so all the
42:29 - images are not the
42:33 - same so one thing that we can do to get
42:35 - a new image is go to open media library
42:37 - and go to free
42:39 - images and now I can just type in
42:43 - coding and you see it's powered by
42:46 - pixabay so we can use any of these
42:49 - images from
42:51 - pixabay and save and insert
42:57 - now this may not be the best image
42:58 - because it's actually not python but
43:00 - we'll just use this for
43:02 - now and then I can hit
43:07 - publish so let's check out the Articles
43:10 - page I added a few extra articles so we
43:14 - can see we have a list of
43:21 - Articles and then if we click in to one
43:24 - we can read the rest of the tutorial
43:30 - so this is looking pretty
43:32 - good so we can see it has the recent
43:34 - post and the categories well pretty much
43:37 - all of these are going to be programming
43:40 - for the category but they do all have
43:42 - different tags so if we go back over to
43:46 - the dashboard let me show you how we can
43:48 - see the tags we're going to go to posts
43:50 - and we're going to go to all posts and
43:53 - you can see that a lot of these have
43:55 - tags that were automatically created by
43:57 - the AI system so instead of showing
44:02 - categories there on the side of the post
44:05 - page let's make it show tags since we
44:08 - have a lot of different tags here I'm
44:11 - going to go back to this page and then
44:13 - I'm going to click
44:15 - customize okay now I'm going to hit this
44:19 - edit button
44:24 - here and you can see there's this
44:26 - category
44:28 - section I'm going to go into this
44:30 - category section and I'm going to delete
44:32 - the list of categories and I'm going to
44:34 - hit the plus button and search for tags
44:37 - I'm going to do a tag
44:39 - cloud and then this word
44:43 - categories I'll just put tags okay now
44:47 - we can see we have this tag Cloud
44:50 - instead of the categories and there's
44:52 - tags for different articles that we have
44:54 - so I'm going to hit publish
44:57 - and we can try that out if I click
45:00 - polymorphism we'll see the articles with
45:03 - polymorphism if I click python we'll see
45:07 - the articles with python which are
45:09 - basically going to be most of them or we
45:11 - can just see all of the
45:14 - Articles now another thing we want to do
45:16 - is go back to the homepage and update
45:20 - so these feature tutorials are actually
45:25 - real tutorials and then we want this
45:27 - view all tutorials to go to the article
45:30 - page so I'm going to edit this
45:34 - page and I'm going to go to this button
45:36 - here and we're going to change this link
45:39 - to the link of this page which right now
45:43 - is python Playbook SL
45:46 - blog but we actually want it to be
45:49 - articles instead of it calling blog we
45:51 - want to do articles so let's first
45:53 - change this URL so it will be python
45:55 - playbook.com
45:57 - / articles and then we will change this
45:59 - link to be the Articles page so let's go
46:03 - back to the
46:07 - dashboard and we'll go to
46:09 - pages and then we have this blog page so
46:14 - I'm going to click
46:16 - edit so there's two places we need to
46:19 - change to make this tutorial so first
46:21 - I'm going to change where it says blog
46:22 - here I'm going change this to tutorials
46:27 - and then where it says URL I'm going to
46:29 - click this button and then type in
46:32 - tutorials okay now I can update this and
46:35 - then let's just uh go back to the page
46:37 - to test it out so if I click
46:42 - articles it's going to go to the
46:45 - tutorials and we can see tutorials here
46:47 - oh yeah we do want this to be the word
46:49 - art tutorials instead of Articles and I
46:52 - know I changed this to articles before
46:54 - but now I realize the menu should say
46:56 - tutorial s so header
46:59 - Builder and then we have the primary
47:03 - menu let's see oh wait here it is
47:08 - header and then articles and this is
47:11 - going to be tutorials so we had change
47:13 - it to articles but sometimes as you're
47:15 - building your page you'll change your
47:17 - mind and then you can easily just make
47:18 - the changes so I'll publish that okay
47:21 - we're getting close to being done with
47:23 - this page but let's make sure the
47:26 - contact page works and then we also want
47:29 - to make sure the subscribe to our
47:31 - newsletter works so let's go to the
47:34 - contact page so I've been kind of
47:36 - zooming in and zooming out so we can see
47:38 - better but we can see even at the 100%
47:41 - zoom level the word contact is still on
47:44 - two different lines and a lot of this
47:46 - this stuff needs to be changed so let's
47:50 - I'll zoom in a little bit and I'm going
47:52 - to go to edit edit page
48:00 - okay first I'm going to make this font a
48:02 - little smaller there's a few ways to do
48:05 - that but I'm just going to change it to
48:07 - an H3 tag or I'll do h2 tag instead of
48:11 - H1 contact us if you want your tutorials
48:13 - to appear on our site we're going to
48:15 - have an email address but we are not
48:18 - going to have a phone
48:20 - number so let me just delete the phone
48:24 - number section
48:27 - and then for the email address remember
48:30 - we made a custom email which is just bow
48:33 - at python
48:36 - playbook.com I'm going to make this so
48:38 - it's a little smaller I I have to select
48:40 - the text and then I have to make sure go
48:42 - to open this content Tab and then I'm
48:46 - going to click
48:49 - P so these social buttons are actually
48:53 - social share buttons they're they're the
48:56 - wrong type of social share buttons these
48:57 - are the buttons that will try to share
49:00 - this page on social media it's not going
49:02 - to link to our social media accounts so
49:06 - to make sure that these can link to our
49:08 - social media accounts we're actually
49:10 - going to have to delete this whole
49:11 - section and we're going to add another
49:14 - social
49:16 - section so this is going to be social
49:20 - icons and we're going to
49:22 - add Twitter
49:27 - I'll select parent and then I can press
49:29 - the plus and then I can do another one
49:31 - I'm going to do a
49:32 - YouTube and then here is where we're
49:34 - going to put the address so I'll put my
49:38 - Twitter and then for the
49:41 - YouTube okay and then the final thing is
49:43 - we want to change this
49:46 - background so we can go to style here
49:50 - and then I'm going to go to change image
49:52 - I'm going to use this image that we're
49:53 - using on the other page and just see how
49:55 - that looks and and all we can change how
49:58 - it's positioned if we want I'll leave
50:00 - that all the same okay now I'm going to
50:02 - go to the send a message
50:05 - form so if I click on this form and I go
50:08 - to the send message form the send
50:10 - message button we can go to actions here
50:14 - and then we can enter an email address
50:16 - to receive the submissions so it
50:19 - defaults to the site email address but
50:21 - just to make sure I'm going to put B at
50:26 - python on
50:27 - playbook.com
50:30 - this we can select what the subject is
50:34 - and we can also if we want to change
50:36 - different things like if we want to
50:39 - instead of calling this subject we could
50:44 - say what is this about and we can add
50:48 - different form Fields by clicking this
50:50 - form button and then click plus and then
50:53 - we can say oh we also want to have a
50:56 - check box
50:58 - box and then you could have someone
51:00 - check if they're contacting to say hi if
51:04 - they're contacting to submit a tutorial
51:07 - or whatever you want to add to the for
51:09 - the text box but I'm going to delete
51:11 - this for now we don't need a text box
51:14 - we'll just leave this how it is okay I'm
51:17 - going to click update and there's one
51:20 - more thing we have to set up to get
51:21 - emails to work we're going going to go
51:23 - to SMTP here and then we're going to
51:26 - install and activate WP mail
51:28 - SMTP this is going to improve email
51:31 - deliverability to make sure the emails
51:34 - go through so let's open the setup
51:36 - Wizard and get started here and then we
51:39 - have to choose the mailer we're going to
51:41 - choose Bravo because it's free so it's
51:44 - it's good option and we'll just go
51:47 - through the setup process
51:49 - here and after we get brao set up we
51:52 - need to get the API key so if we just go
51:54 - back to our setup page on WordPress and
51:59 - click follow this link to get the API C
52:02 - and then we just need to generate a new
52:04 - API key which you can basically name
52:06 - anything you want and then we copy the
52:08 - key paste in here and then the sending
52:11 - domain is just going to be our website
52:14 - and we can update the email of who the
52:16 - emails will come
52:18 - from and then save and continue and then
52:22 - I'll save and continue again and we can
52:24 - skip some of these steps and now we're
52:27 - basically done so let's go back to the
52:30 - contact page and try it out I'll put in
52:32 - my information
52:34 - here and send the message now I'll pop
52:38 - over to my email and if I refresh yep
52:41 - there it is the form
52:43 - submission and you can see the form
52:45 - comes right into my email it
52:48 - works so now let's make sure this
52:51 - subscribe to our newsletter form works
52:55 - so basically we have to make sure that
52:57 - when someone puts an their email address
52:59 - here in here and clicks sub subscribe
53:02 - the email address gets sent to the right
53:04 - place currently it's set up to just
53:07 - email you their email address and then
53:09 - you can add it to the list to make sure
53:11 - that this gets sent to the right place
53:13 - there's two ways you can go about it all
53:16 - forms automatically get sent to the
53:18 - default email address for your website
53:21 - so if that's correct then you don't have
53:23 - to do anything let me show you how you
53:25 - can check that I'm going to go to
53:26 - settings and then
53:29 - General and then we go down here and we
53:32 - can see the administrative email address
53:34 - I'm going to change this I'm going to
53:36 - change this to B python playbook.com
53:43 - okay then I can save changes and then
53:47 - I'll just have to verify
53:51 - that okay so now if someone signs up for
53:54 - the email list you'll get an email here
53:56 - there's one other way to update the
53:59 - email address um if you want this to be
54:01 - sent to a different email address we'll
54:03 - go back to
54:05 - our admin panel and then I have to go
54:10 - to appearance
54:13 - widgets the newsletter thing is actually
54:16 - a widget it's actually the footer
54:18 - Builder widget one so I will go to this
54:22 - is what appears there you can see it a
54:23 - get python tips in your email I'm going
54:26 - to just basically click into this form
54:29 - here I have to make sure that I'm not
54:30 - just clicked on the email address
54:32 - section but I'm clicked on the whole
54:33 - form and you can see this is the form
54:36 - and then I'll just scroll down to
54:38 - actions and then you can put any email
54:41 - address you want here so if you put a
54:43 - different email address you'll get the
54:46 - form submissions to that email address
54:49 - so just to make sure it's correct I'm
54:51 - going to put the email address here
54:54 - again
54:59 - and then we'll update and now I'll try
55:01 - this
55:02 - out I'll subscribe and see if this gets
55:05 - sent to my other email so if I refresh
55:09 - here and form
55:11 - submission okay now we've collected the
55:13 - email address that we can add to our
55:15 - email list now we kind of got
55:18 - sidetracked but on this main page we
55:20 - want to update these featured tutorials
55:22 - here so they aren't just these random
55:25 - things that don't actually exist so
55:28 - let's finish updating that so normally
55:31 - at the top here there will be an edit
55:32 - page bar like if I click tutorials I can
55:34 - see it sometimes it won't show up on the
55:36 - homepage and then you can just get to
55:38 - the editing page right from the admin
55:40 - section so I'm going to go to pages and
55:43 - go to all pages here it allows us to get
55:45 - to quickly to get to any of the pages so
55:48 - with have the contact page the homepage
55:49 - privacy policy tutorials I'm going to go
55:52 - right into the homepage and click edit
55:57 - and then we can see these the problem
55:59 - with these is they're not going to
56:01 - automatically update basically we have
56:03 - to manually update what these featured
56:05 - tutorials are so what I'm going to do is
56:08 - I'm going to put in a new block
56:10 - here and I'm going to go to browse all
56:13 - and you can kind of go down until you
56:15 - see what you want but what we're looking
56:16 - for is the post grid so I'm add this
56:19 - post grid and I can now remove these
56:23 - posts down here so I click here and
56:26 - let's see I'm going to go to
56:28 - delete and now we have this post grid
56:31 - right now it's showing six 1 2 3 four
56:34 - five six it it defaults to six but we're
56:37 - going to change that I'm going go to
56:39 - General and then I'm going to do three
56:41 - so it would be just kind of like how it
56:43 - was before and there's a bunch of other
56:45 - settings you can change you can change
56:48 - how it's going to be ordered uh you can
56:51 - change the number of columns and all
56:53 - these sorts of other things but we're
56:56 - going to just stick with changing the
56:58 - post per page and you can see it's only
57:01 - going to show three posts
57:03 - here and I'm going to click
57:07 - update okay we can see the three posts
57:10 - and then we can go into one of the
57:12 - tutorials click read more and we can go
57:14 - right into it
57:16 - here and there's one more thing we're
57:18 - going to change this view all tutorials
57:20 - let's see where this button goes
57:23 - to it currently just has a a pound sign
57:28 - or a number hash sign so that means it's
57:31 - going to the page we're already on we
57:34 - actually want to go to the tutorials
57:36 - page so we're just going to put slash
57:42 - tutorials and I'll update that now
57:45 - there's a few other things you may want
57:46 - to change like removing or updating this
57:50 - but I think you've learned enough to
57:52 - finish the rest by yourself so now we've
57:55 - learned the basic of creating a blog or
57:59 - an article website using WordPress and
58:01 - AI well that's it you now know how to
58:04 - create and launch a Blog using Wordpress
58:07 - if you've been following along you can
58:09 - continue to customize your blog as much
58:11 - as you want good luck on your blogging
58:13 - Journey

Cleaned transcript:

if you're looking for a guide to making a professional blog website with the help of AI you're in the right place I'm Bo KS with free code camped in this comprehensive course I'll walk you through the steps to create your own WordPress blog even if you're a complete beginner I'll also show you how you can easily use AI to help with things like logo design and writing articles AI can help you create content for your site much quicker WordPress is a free tool you can use to make a wide variety of websites and what you learn in this course will help you even if you don't want to make a Blog there's no coding whatsoever in the course you are going to create everything using a simple graphical interface I'm going to show you how to do the initial setup how to easily customize the site with templates how to create content quickly with AI and all the other things you need to know to use WordPress first I'm going to show you how to get your domain and hosting the primary expense is web hosting but everything else from the domain name to the WordPress platform and website templates is free while you usually have to pay for a domain many providers such as hostinger offer a free domain with certain hosting plans for those new to the blogging World think of the domain name as your website's address similar to youtube.com or freec camp.org web hosting on the other hand is like the land where you build a house it's where your website will live online it's where everything is stored well actually get the domain and hosting at the same place hostinger provided free Campa Grant to make this course possible and we'll use hostinger to get the domain name and hosting we'll be using them to create a managed WordPress website they offer premium features at an affordable price such as 247 customer support a free CDN a malware scanner and more I've actually used them in the past for my personal websites before we got this Grant and they make it super simple to set up a WordPress website but just you know almost everything I teach in this course will work with other hosting providers as well so go to hosting.com use the link in the description to get a better deal than you would normally get so let's see how to create a WordPress website with the help of AI now hostinger has a lot of builtin AI tools that makes things easier you can also use other AI tools such as chat gbt or Dolly but having it all everything included within hosting or just makes things a little simpler so we can see with this there's a few different plans you can choose from I would recommend the business plan because that is the one that's going to give you the WordPress AI tools we're not going to get that with the basic the Premium plan so I'm just going to go through and add this to cart and you can choose your period so the more months you buy at a time the cheaper it's going to be or you can just do a one month period if you just want to try it out I usually recommend doing at least 24 months when I'm going to create my own websites but it's up to you you may just want it for one month just to see how it works so we're just going to either log in or create our account and I've already bought my hosting plan so I'm not going to go through this right now but this is what you would have to do you're going to choose your payment method and then put all that in and then you're just going to do submit secure payment so after you get logged in or possibly during the account creation process you're going to have to claim a domain or get a domain you may already have a domain from another website you can use hostinger whether you purchase your domain name through hostinger or through another domain registr so I'm going to choose my domain now it could take a while to find a domain name that's not already taken but I was already doing some searching on what domain names are available and I'm going to go with python on playbook so hopefully this is still available yep I'm going to claim that domain you're going to have to put in contact information when you create a domain and some hosting providers will automatically hide that information from people that are searching it up some won't in hostinger all domains are going to have free who is privacy protection so that's nice um if you don't have that then all the contact information you put in when you're getting your domain will be available for anybody to see and you're going to get a bunch of calls and emails of people trying to sell you things for your new new domain and you probably don't want that so that's what's pretty cool about hostinger is that you get the free privacy protection so I'm just going to go to finish registration there's different ways to get into the hosting um I'm going to go to um skip because we're going to go back to home and I'm going to set up the business web hosting now depending on how you create your account there could be different ways to get into this setup so I'm going to be creating a Blog that's going to teach quick python tips and different just small nuggets of of knowledge of how to program in Python mainly because I have a lot of knowledge in that area so I might as well share the knowledge with others and I can easily use AI to help me create this content quickly so I'm going going to just go through this I'm going to create a website and here you're going to have to choose if you want to create a website WordPress with AI or the hosting or website builder now the hosting website builder is best for absolute beginners and the WordPress with the AI is still good for beginners but but it's going to be slight it's going to give you slightly more features which means it's going to be slightly more complicated and you're going to have a little more power over your website and it's better for people to have a little a little more knowledge so the hosting website builder uses customizable templates to simplify the website building process and they're all premade website designs that include images layouts and texts and then WordPress is is going to use themes alter the web appearance and the theme is a package of premade templates website elements and customization tools so we want to have a little more control so we're going to do WordPress with AI but if you want it to be even simpler you can click website the hosting or website builder so create with WordPress and then you're going to want to create a password that it's going to this email and password will be used to log into the WordPress account so you have one set of login details for hostinger and another set of login details for the WordPress account and I'm going to choose a Blog now everything I'm talking about in this tutorial will be relevant to creating an online store as well so you can also choose that if you want the online store so now we're choosing between prebuilt templates or standard themes it's pretty selfexplanatory the prebuilt templat is going to have things more already created for you and the standard themes are you're going to have to customize it a little more so if you're really into customizing to standard themes we're going to go with prebuilt templates to simplify the process and get our blog running as quick as possible so I'm going to choose one of these templates now again we can go back to standard themes if we want to have a little more flexibility and we can also preview these like I'm going to preview this one and you can see it's powered by Astro which is a common WordPress theme or template now since I'm making a website about python tips and python tutorials I think it's more similar to this child care blog there's not going to be videos but uh just how a childcare blog would have different lots of different blog posts about raising children this one's going to have a lot of different blog posts teaching how to work with python so I'm going to select this and then I'm just trying to make this as quick and easy as possible so you can either select all the plugins you want manually or use the preselected plugins so I'm just going to use the preselected plugins we can also always change these later if we want and this is where the AI is going to start helping us do you want to generate blog content with AI we just have to enter some information about the website and the description and the AI will start generating original content tailored for us and here's my description welcome to python Playbook your goto spot for diving into the world of Python Programming with a Twist of humor whether you're just starting out or looking to brush up on your skills our blog makes learning python not only easy but entertaining we break down complex Concepts into simple digestible analogies and sprinkle in a healthy dose of laughs to keep things light and fun so I won't keep bring the rest but the more details you add the better and the more the AI will have to work with when creating the content so I'm just going to go with next and then we select the domain name and we can select where we're going to be based out of I think there'll be a lot of people the there's actually more people in the United States on the left side of the United States or the the west side so I'm going to go with Arizona okay after the website's created we'll be put into this dashboard and so so let's just do some basic things first so let's preview the website I'll actually click on this to open up the website in a new tab and you can see it's using the child care theme that we chose now obviously we're going to be going through and updating this in a moment here but if we go to blog you can see that we already have some blog entries now it's going to give us the child care examples and then the python examples now these all look to be about the same these aren't exactly what we want for articles these articles are going to introduce people to the website welcome to python Playbook and then you can see it gives information about what the website's going to be about and later I'll show you how to use AI to create some more blog entries so I'm going to close that for now and before we start customizing the website I'm going to set up the free email after the email is set up we can click manage and then we can choose the email plan I'm just going to go with the free one and then we choose our email address and our password and then create and then we can access the email through the browser or actually apps on our computer the simplest is just using our browser and then I can click webmail and now I can email people through this or I can receive emails right to this email address and there's also a way to set it up to forward to a different account if you don't want to use this web interface and if you want to check all of your emails from the same account but that's beyond the scope of this tutorial so I'm just going to close this because I'm not going to write an email right now and I'll click complete and we also want to make sure the DKI is set up correctly this can it says right here prevent spoofing and fishing and makes emails less likely to be marked as spam so I just go to generate here and then it says to verify the DKI record add this txt record to your DNS Zone it can take up to six hours for the verification to be finished so what I'm going to do I'm going to keep this page open and I'm going to open a new tab with hosting and then manage the hosting and actually I'm supposed to be on domains domains and then manage the domain and then go to DNS name servers and here is where I'm going to add a record so I'm going to go to txt and then for the name that's the host so I'm going to copy that and paste in this name and then for the txt value is going to be this second one and I'll paste that into here and then I'll just push add record okay so we added this record here and I can just go and say I have added the dkim record in my DNS zone now that will just make our emails be less likely to be marked as spam when we send from this email address okay let's go back to our websites and then manage and then we're back to the admin panel here and so we can also make change on some other things like the backups um you can see there's other things we can do on this main page here but we really want to go to the WordPress admin panel that's where we're going to go to make all of our changes now WordPress on hostinger is very similar to Wordpress on a lot of other hosting providers so like I said earlier you can follow along even if you're not using hostinger hostinger just provides some AI tools that are going to make things a little simpler so we're going to start by just going through the steps here we're going to start by creating a logo and hostinger has this really cool AI logo maker to make things even easier so I'm going to go to the AI logo maker and then I'll get logged in and you can see we default with one credit to make a logo but you can also buy more if you want more logos or you can create your logo using a different tool you don't have to use the AI logo maker so I said just logo for blog with quick Python programming tutorials and you can choose the style that you want want I'm going to stay on abstract and see what happens so we can use one of these or just create our own so we also have the ability to edit the logo we can download so I'm going to download this one and the editing that you can do within this program is kind of limited but you can also always just bring in these Graphics into your own image editor if you want to make it more detailed so I can just close this tab and then it's going to show how we can finish uploading our logo okay now we just have to go to the customize page and upload the logo so we'll go to take me there and then we'll go to site identity and then site title and Logo settings and then I'll just select the logo I actually made a different logo and didn't use the AI options we were seeing earlier so I'll just hit select okay so it's like the python logo and it kind of has the Playbook like a a sports Playbook on there so I thought that was kind of cool okay and I also want to use a site icon this is what's going to appear right uh in the right in the browser next at the very top there's always an icon next to the name here so I'm going to select the icon and it says suggested 512 x 512 pixels which is actually what this logo already is 512 x 512 so I'll select that and then now you can see already right in the top here so that's pretty cool and now we're going to go through and just update the design so it fits more with what we want and then I will show you how to use the AI to make more blog entries so first I'm going to go into Global here and we can change all these different settings so I could change the typography I'm going to keep the typography the same but I do want to change the colors so right now we see the this blue blue purple black gray white and you can see everything uses those colors so um this color this wiish is actually here and then we have the colors of the text and if we see these buttons that blue in this buttons when I hover over view all articles is the same blue right here so I'm going to go through and change this to some different colors that align with my brand better so we could go through and select one of these presets here but I'm going to manually change the color here and I want this green that's in the logo I want that to be the accent and the links so I'll just click here and then if I scroll down I can actually enter a hex value right here so I'm going to paste the color hex value I got from my image editing software and then I can change this to be the same one and then I'll also change this color up here so any time I see this blue I'll change that okay now if I scroll down we can see that we're using we're seeing the Green in the different part of the page now I still have to figure out sometimes the color the changing the colors will be in different spots you'll see when I hover over this it becomes blue when I hover over this becomes green I don't want to become blue when I hover over I want to become dark green something you just have to kind of mess around a little bit cuz it's not immediately obvious which color goes to which thing but I see this blue here so I'm going to first put on my hex value and then I'm just going to use this to make it a little darker just like that okay and now when I hover over the button it goes to dark green instead of dark blue great now I'm going to change a few more things I see these a see these lines here um I see it's the same color this so I'm going to change color seven this time I'm just going to change it myself I kind of want it to be um a yellowish color maybe a little lighter than that okay so now we have these lines are yellow so you can just go around and experiment until you change the colors of everything that you want to change and the rest of the colors look good this you can still see the blue right here but that's just an image that we can change so first before I go out of this I want to hit publish and then I can hit X to go out of this screen here and if I refresh we should be able to see the changes so we can see what the page looks like with those changes okay I'm going to go back into customize now and then if we go into the global section we can still change a few more things like if we go into buttons we can change what the buttons looks like you can see it brings in the colors from before that's pretty nice but for the most part I like all the button stuff so you can go through and and change global settings but we're going to come back over here you can go through and change things in any of these categories we're going to go we're going to go into more of those in a little bit but let's see how we can change our main page here so right now we're just customizing the look of things we cannot actually customize the text on here so I'm just going to hit publish to make sure it saves everything I've done I can hit X here and now before we we're on customize but now we're going to go to edit page so you can see it takes us into this other editor here welcome to the block editor and it just talks about how each section is a different block of content and then you can basically edit different blocks however you want and you should look at the Block Library see what you can add okay so what we're going to do is just start making some changes here so instead of Welcome to bua I just can just double click and I could really change anything I could change the font the text size anything like that but I'm just going to change the text to python Playbook since we want the site to have funny entertaining posts we're going to use a slogan python made playful and again if we want to change anything we could like we can make it bold italic we can copy the format and there's all sorts of different ways we can change what the text looks like now for some of the texts on the page we're going to try using the ask AI feature now there's different types of AI that we'll be talking about some of the AI is created right from hostinger this is a different service that you can use but we're just going to get signed up for for this with 1,000 free credits okay I just created an account really quick and I just have to connect it and we can see we have we've used zero of 1,000 usages so let me come back over here let me just refresh to make sure it loads now that we've logged into the other website to save it I'm going to click update and then I'll refresh here okay I'm going to hit ask ask AI here and you can see we also have ask AI down here this is for when you want to ask questions about WordPress or we can click ask AI here if we want to help make text uh fix grammar change tone make larger make shorter write a one sentence description on my blog where post short humorous python tutorials and we can use this or we can just click refresh and we'll try writing it one more time okay I'm just click use this and now it replaces the text with this new text now let's just keep scrolling down and see what else we want to change well are we could actually change put some new logos here of where we've been featured but we haven't been featured anywhere so I'm going to actually take out this whole section so I'm going to click in here and then I'm going going to go to delete so we delete that section going to delete this section and we don't need a contact page right now so I can delete this section okay and the only other thing to fix in here is this background image so this background image obviously does not go with our website so to change this image you're going to make sure the the setting tab is open here and then you can kind of just go around to see different things you want to change well we're going to change the image but you can also change different things such as the the position you can change the width of things the minimum height how high actually I'm going to make it so it's not quite as high and for the width go to about there but let's go and change the image so I'm just going to click change image so I'm just going to upload a new file here and this is a file I just made for the website I basically made a hello world program that was as complicated as possible and then I'm going to use that as kind of uh an image that's going to be in the corner there so I can specify the alt text so I'm going to do hello world and then I'll select that okay so now um it just has this hello world I I made this curve here so it kind of be similar to the other image uh it looks like you can you can see this like we could change the size the color of this text or we could change this green if it was going to be hard to read but I think people will be able to read that so since this is mainly a Blog I mean we could make a section that talks about me the creator of the blog but I'll just skip that so I'm going to delete this whole block so you can see when you move your mouse around you can see a blue line that goes around whatever section you're on so I want to go onto this section you can see the blue line on the corner here and then I can go to delete right under this we have featured articles which we want to keep and then Learn Python quickly instead of Articles I'm actually going to call these tutorials and then where it says view all articles I'm going to change this to tutorial so these articles we will update later so if you keep scrolling down we can see see where's this child care topics the child care block if you see these blue Lin inside this other bigger block and the other bigger block also has um what they say and it has meet the experts so these are all things we can update it's very easy to update like if I wanted to update this expert with a different picture I could just go to replace upload and then just bring in a picture of me here and it would be easy to just update this name bo KS and then the social media links you may not want all of them like I could delete this one so pretty much all of this stuff can be edited but I am just going to remove this section because I don't want any of this so I'm going to go to delete but let's say we wanted to add a new section I'm going to get to this stuff down here in a second so if I want to add a new section I'm going to go up here it says toggle block inserter and then we're going to decide what type of block we want to add so I'm going to add a container go down to the bottom we can see what we decide what layout we want so I'm going to do this this layout that has the three different sections and then we can add a block to each of these sections like for instance maybe I want to add a map in the first section so the first section could be a map and then and then the second section go to browse all again let's say we want a video and the final section let's say we just want an image so each of these things we added we can customize and you can see over on the side we we can change like we can change the zoom we can change the height we can select the address like I can say so now we're the map is of Los Angeles California and I could zoom in further on there and then for YouTube I can just put the URL to embed a video and it's a WordPress tutorial that I created and then for image it's just like before you can upload or choose an image from the media library I'm just going to choose this one that's already in there so basically with adding different blocks you can customize the page how you like but I'm just going to actually delete the this whole thing I don't need this and I am going to update the page and we're just going to see what the page looks like for now so go to view page oh we can see there are some things on the page that we didn't see before because we edit those in a different place um but we can go down we see featured tutorials Learn Python quickly now later we're going to update those with the and then we also have some things that we still have to get to to learn how to update like the subscribe to our newsletter and some of the stuff we still have to update the logo there So eventually we're going to get to using the AI to write some articles for us but let's work on updating this menu here changing this button right here and then also updating the footer so first let's look at the header so first let's just see what's we have here so we have the blog which we do need to update we have the babies Tab and the sensory Play tab and both these just have the same article here and then we have the contact page so for our website we just want the home we want blog but want that to be called articles and then we want the contact page we don't need these other Pages for what we're trying to do later if we want to add a section for different types of programming languages we can so I'm going to go back to the dashboard and this is could be the first time we're seeing the homepage of the dashboard and some of these things we can get rid of like we'll just dismiss some of these things and then what remember we're trying to update the header so I'm going to go to appearance and then menus so to update this top menu I'm going to go back to customize and then if I scroll down we have menus and then we see there's a few different menus but I'm going to go to the header menu and see it says home blog baby sensory play contact that's all we have up here well I'm going to to get rid of some of these so sensory play I'll remove babies I'll remove and then blog we're going to change this to articles okay so now we have home articles contact and then to get rid of this appointment button I'm going to go to header Builder and then it has the all the elements in the header and you can actually see it right down here so we have the site title and logo we have the primary menu and we have the button over here so I can just click remove element to remove that button okay now just click publish and then we have that done I'm going to go down to the bottom and let's update this stuff we do want a newsletter so I'm just going to click this edit button and will take us right to what we want to change here and it's this section is called the above footer so there's a few different sections we can see them down here so this copyright section that's right here this where it says Power by Pyon Playbook that's this and then we can see all these widgets here are in this footer right here and then this top one right here is this this widget right here so I'm just going to click edit so I'm going to click this settings button and then here's where I can make some changes so I'm going to say get python tips in your email so if I select this form and go to show more settings we can see more information about the form so once you submit it it's going to say the form has been submitted successfully and you can change what it says you can change what the error message is there's just a bunch of things you can change on it and then later we'll see where we where all the information comes in but we got that how we want it and now let's update some of these things well this add widget add widget um we don't need any extra widgets right now so we'll remove those and we do want to change this logo here so I clicked where it says hl1 now this logo I'm just going to delete it and now I can insert an image and I can resize it it's just going to say the best place to Learn Python and as I think about this I just want this stuff to be in the middle I'm going to make sure to Center this I'm going to remove this widget and then I can just move this to the middle and then move the social tags to the middle and then we could just do some modifications like we can change I can change the YouTube url I can change the Twitter URL and then I can just delete anything that I don't want okay then final thing I forgot to change the background for this subscribe to our newsletter cuz these colors are not the colors we're using so to moove this background and to change it I'm going to click the edit here go to design background remove the image I'm actually going to set it to a color a gradient okay I'm going to click publish and then let's see what the website looks like no for some reason it didn't save the text here so let's go to footer widget one looks good so let's see how to create articles I'm going have to go back to the dashboard and then if I go to posts I can see all the posts we currently have and I'm just going to delete most of these except one that is the one that we create with AI to describe what the website is like so I'll just do bulk action move to trash and apply why so now if we go back here to the Articles and if I refresh we should just see one article and if you go read more see the whole thing but we want to create a few more articles so there's a few ways to do it on this page I could click new post or on the post page I can do add new post post so I can create the title and then I would just start typing the post here and then I could add blocks I can add images or anything like that this is how you create the post if you're going to Rite it yourself but if you want to use the AI tools to to write it I'm going I can going to leave this page and go to the main admin dashboard and then I'm going to hover over hope hostinger and then AI content creator and here we can create as much AI content as we want earlier I was showing you Spectra and this only gives you a certain number of credits and then you have to buy more but with the hosting or AI content creator it's actually separate you can make as many as you want so we can either create a post that's like the article or a page a page is like the homepage the contact page page or a page is generally something that's a permanent main part of your website a post is like an article or blog post so I'm going to use a witty tone length I'll say long it says usually use to make high ranked articles that will generate more leads and then what your contact about this article is about the basics of the Python programming language and I can do keywords or the AI can automatically generate the keyword suggestion so I'll just click generate content okay so this will create an AI generated image for the article and we can either set it as the featured image as we can set the featured image as home and we can either set this as the featured image as a thumbnail or insert the image inside the content I'm going to set as the thumbnail and then it basically gives an article about python the basics of python and so it's going to give some of the history of python some reasons why to Learn Python and down here uh it gives a bold list of all the different reasons to Learn Python and then getting started with python talks about installing python setting up an IDE writing it first program object oriented programming so this has a lot of features in this article so I'm just going to click publish so let's create a few more articles about python so go back to the dashboard hostinger AI content creator and this time I'm going to say it's a it's going to be a funny article a humorous tutorial about if statements in Python okay that's an interesting uh photo but we'll go with it the Wacky World of if statements a hilariously informative python Journey now one thing about some AI generated articles is that there are certain words that will really give it away that's AI generated two of them are in this first sentence I've never seen them so close together but delve and intricacies articles that use the word delve and intri intricacies a lot uh it's generally give away that it's AI generated but one thing cool is that the code even is kind of like in a code block here and overall actually this article is pretty good it's giving a lot of different examples and this time I'm going to edit it as a draft instead of publishing it so I'm just going to call it the Wacky World of if statements and then I'm going to say before we talk about if statements now it's my own article kind of it's it's at least not so obvious right away that it's AI generated okay before I publish this one I'll actually talk about this you've probably seen this at the bottom of all the pages and articles this is all stuff to help with SEO so it's going to show what it's going to look like in a search engine and then you can make changes to what the post title is going to be so this title you can see right here the it has the post title the separator was is this Dash and then the site title Python playbook.com and then for The Meta description um that's what's right here it's just going to be an excerpt from the post if you don't want this post excerpt we can just say an article about if statements and you can see how it it changes right up here and then there's just some different things about SEO like this is going to just give you some some tips for improving SEO we need we should have a longer metad description that's I mean this is pretty short here so we could make that longer there's no internal links so we may want to add links there's no external links so we may want to add external links and all that will make things better and readability we see that there's not a lot of images or videos it's uses a lot of passive voice and that doesn't have good subheading distribution so we could go through and update those if we want better SEO but for now I'm just going to publish the article and then we click publish here and let's just make a few more articles so I'm going to go to the AI content creator again and this time I'm going to create a short post because one of the ideas behind our blog are is short articles about python write a humorous tutorial about variables in Python okay the AI generated image is the same so I guess it may be AI Chosen and not actually generated but it's still a pretty good image for the article and one thing you can do if you look at it and it's not exactly what you want you can make some changes so I'm going to say with a lot of code examples okay this is a lot better and I like that there's some code examples so I'm just going to publish this and we'll do one more write a humorous tutorial about loops in Python with many code examples and I'll edit this so I can insert another image just so all the images are not the same so one thing that we can do to get a new image is go to open media library and go to free images and now I can just type in coding and you see it's powered by pixabay so we can use any of these images from pixabay and save and insert now this may not be the best image because it's actually not python but we'll just use this for now and then I can hit publish so let's check out the Articles page I added a few extra articles so we can see we have a list of Articles and then if we click in to one we can read the rest of the tutorial so this is looking pretty good so we can see it has the recent post and the categories well pretty much all of these are going to be programming for the category but they do all have different tags so if we go back over to the dashboard let me show you how we can see the tags we're going to go to posts and we're going to go to all posts and you can see that a lot of these have tags that were automatically created by the AI system so instead of showing categories there on the side of the post page let's make it show tags since we have a lot of different tags here I'm going to go back to this page and then I'm going to click customize okay now I'm going to hit this edit button here and you can see there's this category section I'm going to go into this category section and I'm going to delete the list of categories and I'm going to hit the plus button and search for tags I'm going to do a tag cloud and then this word categories I'll just put tags okay now we can see we have this tag Cloud instead of the categories and there's tags for different articles that we have so I'm going to hit publish and we can try that out if I click polymorphism we'll see the articles with polymorphism if I click python we'll see the articles with python which are basically going to be most of them or we can just see all of the Articles now another thing we want to do is go back to the homepage and update so these feature tutorials are actually real tutorials and then we want this view all tutorials to go to the article page so I'm going to edit this page and I'm going to go to this button here and we're going to change this link to the link of this page which right now is python Playbook SL blog but we actually want it to be articles instead of it calling blog we want to do articles so let's first change this URL so it will be python playbook.com / articles and then we will change this link to be the Articles page so let's go back to the dashboard and we'll go to pages and then we have this blog page so I'm going to click edit so there's two places we need to change to make this tutorial so first I'm going to change where it says blog here I'm going change this to tutorials and then where it says URL I'm going to click this button and then type in tutorials okay now I can update this and then let's just uh go back to the page to test it out so if I click articles it's going to go to the tutorials and we can see tutorials here oh yeah we do want this to be the word art tutorials instead of Articles and I know I changed this to articles before but now I realize the menu should say tutorial s so header Builder and then we have the primary menu let's see oh wait here it is header and then articles and this is going to be tutorials so we had change it to articles but sometimes as you're building your page you'll change your mind and then you can easily just make the changes so I'll publish that okay we're getting close to being done with this page but let's make sure the contact page works and then we also want to make sure the subscribe to our newsletter works so let's go to the contact page so I've been kind of zooming in and zooming out so we can see better but we can see even at the 100% zoom level the word contact is still on two different lines and a lot of this this stuff needs to be changed so let's I'll zoom in a little bit and I'm going to go to edit edit page okay first I'm going to make this font a little smaller there's a few ways to do that but I'm just going to change it to an H3 tag or I'll do h2 tag instead of H1 contact us if you want your tutorials to appear on our site we're going to have an email address but we are not going to have a phone number so let me just delete the phone number section and then for the email address remember we made a custom email which is just bow at python playbook.com I'm going to make this so it's a little smaller I I have to select the text and then I have to make sure go to open this content Tab and then I'm going to click P so these social buttons are actually social share buttons they're they're the wrong type of social share buttons these are the buttons that will try to share this page on social media it's not going to link to our social media accounts so to make sure that these can link to our social media accounts we're actually going to have to delete this whole section and we're going to add another social section so this is going to be social icons and we're going to add Twitter I'll select parent and then I can press the plus and then I can do another one I'm going to do a YouTube and then here is where we're going to put the address so I'll put my Twitter and then for the YouTube okay and then the final thing is we want to change this background so we can go to style here and then I'm going to go to change image I'm going to use this image that we're using on the other page and just see how that looks and and all we can change how it's positioned if we want I'll leave that all the same okay now I'm going to go to the send a message form so if I click on this form and I go to the send message form the send message button we can go to actions here and then we can enter an email address to receive the submissions so it defaults to the site email address but just to make sure I'm going to put B at python on playbook.com this we can select what the subject is and we can also if we want to change different things like if we want to instead of calling this subject we could say what is this about and we can add different form Fields by clicking this form button and then click plus and then we can say oh we also want to have a check box box and then you could have someone check if they're contacting to say hi if they're contacting to submit a tutorial or whatever you want to add to the for the text box but I'm going to delete this for now we don't need a text box we'll just leave this how it is okay I'm going to click update and there's one more thing we have to set up to get emails to work we're going going to go to SMTP here and then we're going to install and activate WP mail SMTP this is going to improve email deliverability to make sure the emails go through so let's open the setup Wizard and get started here and then we have to choose the mailer we're going to choose Bravo because it's free so it's it's good option and we'll just go through the setup process here and after we get brao set up we need to get the API key so if we just go back to our setup page on WordPress and click follow this link to get the API C and then we just need to generate a new API key which you can basically name anything you want and then we copy the key paste in here and then the sending domain is just going to be our website and we can update the email of who the emails will come from and then save and continue and then I'll save and continue again and we can skip some of these steps and now we're basically done so let's go back to the contact page and try it out I'll put in my information here and send the message now I'll pop over to my email and if I refresh yep there it is the form submission and you can see the form comes right into my email it works so now let's make sure this subscribe to our newsletter form works so basically we have to make sure that when someone puts an their email address here in here and clicks sub subscribe the email address gets sent to the right place currently it's set up to just email you their email address and then you can add it to the list to make sure that this gets sent to the right place there's two ways you can go about it all forms automatically get sent to the default email address for your website so if that's correct then you don't have to do anything let me show you how you can check that I'm going to go to settings and then General and then we go down here and we can see the administrative email address I'm going to change this I'm going to change this to B python playbook.com okay then I can save changes and then I'll just have to verify that okay so now if someone signs up for the email list you'll get an email here there's one other way to update the email address um if you want this to be sent to a different email address we'll go back to our admin panel and then I have to go to appearance widgets the newsletter thing is actually a widget it's actually the footer Builder widget one so I will go to this is what appears there you can see it a get python tips in your email I'm going to just basically click into this form here I have to make sure that I'm not just clicked on the email address section but I'm clicked on the whole form and you can see this is the form and then I'll just scroll down to actions and then you can put any email address you want here so if you put a different email address you'll get the form submissions to that email address so just to make sure it's correct I'm going to put the email address here again and then we'll update and now I'll try this out I'll subscribe and see if this gets sent to my other email so if I refresh here and form submission okay now we've collected the email address that we can add to our email list now we kind of got sidetracked but on this main page we want to update these featured tutorials here so they aren't just these random things that don't actually exist so let's finish updating that so normally at the top here there will be an edit page bar like if I click tutorials I can see it sometimes it won't show up on the homepage and then you can just get to the editing page right from the admin section so I'm going to go to pages and go to all pages here it allows us to get to quickly to get to any of the pages so with have the contact page the homepage privacy policy tutorials I'm going to go right into the homepage and click edit and then we can see these the problem with these is they're not going to automatically update basically we have to manually update what these featured tutorials are so what I'm going to do is I'm going to put in a new block here and I'm going to go to browse all and you can kind of go down until you see what you want but what we're looking for is the post grid so I'm add this post grid and I can now remove these posts down here so I click here and let's see I'm going to go to delete and now we have this post grid right now it's showing six 1 2 3 four five six it it defaults to six but we're going to change that I'm going go to General and then I'm going to do three so it would be just kind of like how it was before and there's a bunch of other settings you can change you can change how it's going to be ordered uh you can change the number of columns and all these sorts of other things but we're going to just stick with changing the post per page and you can see it's only going to show three posts here and I'm going to click update okay we can see the three posts and then we can go into one of the tutorials click read more and we can go right into it here and there's one more thing we're going to change this view all tutorials let's see where this button goes to it currently just has a a pound sign or a number hash sign so that means it's going to the page we're already on we actually want to go to the tutorials page so we're just going to put slash tutorials and I'll update that now there's a few other things you may want to change like removing or updating this but I think you've learned enough to finish the rest by yourself so now we've learned the basic of creating a blog or an article website using WordPress and AI well that's it you now know how to create and launch a Blog using Wordpress if you've been following along you can continue to customize your blog as much as you want good luck on your blogging Journey
