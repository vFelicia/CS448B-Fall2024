00:00 - Hi, in this video we are going to talk
about: what is a LAN? A LAN is a 'local
00:04 - area network.' So, what does it mean?
Imagine you have your home and you have
00:09 - your own wireless router, you got your
desktop connected, your laptop connected
00:13 - and a printer connected to this router.
And your neighbor has a similar setup. He
00:18 - has home router, and desktop is connected,
and he's got two laptops, and they're all
00:23 - in their own network. So now what happens is this network which is in your home is
00:29 - a LAN. It is local to your home and this
particular network in your neighbor's
00:36 - house is a different LAN. So these two
are two different local area networks.
