00:00 - hey what's up everybody welcome back to
00:01 - css3 in 30 days today's day number 21
00:04 - and we're going to be coding up some
00:06 - animated css only spinners let's check
00:10 - it out
00:11 - animated spinners right here day number
00:13 - 21 we're going to be making these right
00:15 - here spinners what would you use a
00:16 - spinner for when you're loading content
00:19 - when you're loading a page you know when
00:22 - you're loading an application an image
00:24 - that's where you'd use a spinner you see
00:26 - it quite often in websites applications
00:29 - software
00:30 - uh it's simply or watching videos even
00:33 - the spinner just indicates that
00:35 - something is happening something is
00:37 - loading and it's uh
00:39 - they're kind of fascinating to look at
00:42 - and these are only made in or these are
00:44 - made
00:45 - in css3 only so
00:48 - let's jump in and get started
00:50 - here in our code editor we're going to
00:52 - go ahead and download day number 21
00:57 - spinners
00:58 - i'm gonna give you a
01:00 - second to do that in fact you could just
01:02 - pause the video go ahead and do that
01:04 - and i'm just gonna show you a couple
01:06 - things so here's the index
01:07 - file html is very simple it's simply a
01:10 - div with the class of spinner one and a
01:12 - dip with the class of spinner two that's
01:14 - it let's jump into our sandbox and get
01:16 - coding our css first thing we're gonna
01:19 - do is we're gonna select spinner dash
01:21 - one and we're gonna give it a position
01:23 - of relative display of inline
01:27 - block
01:28 - vertical line of middle
01:31 - and now we're going to give it a width
01:33 - 64 pixels and height 64 pixels
01:38 - and a border radius of 64 pixels you
01:42 - could also say 100 that should do the
01:44 - trick but 64 pixels means it is going to
01:46 - be if the border raises border radius
01:48 - for 64 pixels and it's the same as width
01:51 - and height then it's gonna be perfect
01:52 - circle
01:53 - all right
01:54 - if we save that
01:56 - you probably shouldn't actually see
01:58 - anything at this point you just see an
01:59 - empty space that's 64 by 64. beauty
02:02 - now we're going to do is we're going to
02:03 - say spinner dash 1 and the before sudo
02:07 - position absolute
02:10 - we got to give it a content of an empty
02:11 - string of course
02:13 - and width whoops width of 64 pixels
02:17 - height of 64 pixels
02:19 - and a border radius again 64 pixels
02:22 - we're going to give it a color of 3 2 3
02:25 - and this is the text color
02:28 - 323b40 but here's the thing there's
02:30 - going to be no text but we're going to
02:32 - be using an interesting css
02:34 - value called current color it's kind of
02:37 - like a css variable so watch this if i
02:40 - were to go
02:41 - box shadow inset
02:44 - negative 5 pixels 0 0 and then 5 pixels
02:47 - and then
02:48 - current color that's going to grab the
02:49 - actual color so it's kind of like you
02:51 - set a variable so i'm going to save that
02:53 - check it out in the browser you can see
02:55 - the current color is that gray
02:58 - because it's grabbing current color if i
03:00 - were to remove this i'm not really sure
03:02 - what would happen
03:03 - it looks like it would be it's grabbing
03:05 - the text color
03:07 - uh it's inheriting the text color from
03:09 - the body but if i were to change this to
03:11 - red
03:12 - the current color should be red so
03:14 - that's how that works right there pretty
03:15 - fun little css trick there and now we're
03:18 - going to do is we're going to clip this
03:20 - shape this unusual shape we just made to
03:23 - a rectangle but we're going to actually
03:26 - define the values here 0 64 pixels
03:30 - comma 32 pixels
03:33 - comma 0. that will give us this shape
03:36 - here again
03:38 - kind of weird
03:39 - but hang with me it's kind of like a
03:41 - like a like an 8-bit hockey stick
03:43 - hanging upside down
03:46 - but watch this
03:48 - we're going to actually say border
03:50 - radius
03:51 - oh here's the problem
03:55 - oh there we go border radius i thought i
03:57 - already added that
03:58 - but i didn't do it properly border 864
04:00 - so this hockey stick shape is actually
04:02 - going to now get this shape here
04:04 - that looks a lot nicer
04:07 - so
04:08 - you can see what the border radius did
04:09 - to change that so this
04:11 - this shape there without the border
04:12 - radius
04:14 - actually kind of looks like it's very
04:16 - unusual the right side of it is thicker
04:18 - the top side of it is is a bit thinner
04:21 - and long but the border radius really
04:23 - gives it a nice feel and you can almost
04:25 - see now how that's going to turn in you
04:27 - know how that's going to look when we
04:28 - spin it
04:29 - so now we're going to do is say
04:30 - animation
04:32 - we're going to give the animation name
04:34 - of rotator
04:37 - uh one second
04:38 - infinitely
04:40 - linear in fact i want to ease it i think
04:43 - that might be
04:44 - let's see what that looks like
04:46 - and now we need to create a keyframe so
04:49 - keyframes it's called rotator
04:51 - rotator
04:53 - at zero percent we're going to say
04:56 - transform and we're going to rotate it
04:59 - 180 degrees
05:03 - and let's uh say 50
05:06 - we're gonna go rotate
05:08 - to
05:09 - transform whoops transform
05:12 - rotate back to zero degrees
05:15 - and then 100
05:18 - we're gonna do
05:19 - back to
05:20 - 180 degrees let's see what that does
05:26 - interesting
05:29 - very interesting
05:31 - okay
05:33 - this the first one actually needs to be
05:34 - negative 180 degrees
05:36 - but i'm gonna try something here
05:39 - okay
05:42 - so do you see because i have an ease
05:44 - it's actually doing this like jump jump
05:47 - jump
05:48 - jump if i make it linear
05:50 - let's see it should just be spinning
05:53 - exactly but now i'm wondering if i just
05:55 - started at zero let's just try something
05:56 - start at zero and i just say 100 we spin
06:00 - at 360. it should still do the same
06:02 - thing
06:03 - yeah and now i can do ease
06:08 - i like that
06:12 - it's kind of neat
06:14 - so let's try that okay but now what i
06:16 - want to do is i wanted to also
06:18 - animate the box shadow
06:22 - and we're going to say
06:24 - inset negative 5 pixels 0 0 5 pixels
06:27 - current color that's in fact the same
06:29 - box shadows right now but we need to set
06:32 - it
06:33 - to this because what i want to do is now
06:36 - make a very uh variant make a variation
06:39 - of it so box shadow at
06:43 - okay this is where i might need
06:45 - let's try this negative one and then one
06:49 - let's see what that looks like
06:52 - very weird
06:54 - so
06:55 - here's where i'm going to actually throw
06:56 - that 50 back in there and i'm going to
06:59 - transform the whole thing
07:01 - i'm going to say 180 degrees here starts
07:04 - at 0
07:05 - to 180 degrees and then 360.
07:09 - and i'm going to do this box shadow
07:11 - at 50 i'm going to do this and then at
07:13 - 100 i'm going to go back to this
07:17 - that should give me an interesting
07:19 - effect
07:21 - okay
07:22 - it does do something it's kind of like a
07:25 - we're doing some weird stuff here folks
07:26 - we're gonna change this back to linear
07:28 - that should probably make there we go
07:31 - so there we go so you see how
07:34 - as it goes around it gets thinner and
07:36 - then thicker thinner and thicker it's
07:38 - kind of neat
07:39 - looks like a tadpole
07:42 - in a way now i don't like how
07:46 - it's thin on the side i kind of want to
07:48 - get thin at the top so that's where i'm
07:50 - going to go back here to zero percent
07:51 - i'm going to say negative 180 degrees to
07:53 - start at
07:54 - then it's gonna go spin to zero degrees
07:57 - at the top which will make it thin at
07:58 - the top and then i'm going to bring it
08:00 - to 180 degrees here
08:02 - that is going to change where
08:04 - it gets smaller
08:06 - at the top
08:08 - yep i like that that looks good there's
08:11 - our first rotator now let's go down to
08:13 - the next
08:14 - spinner so i'm going to leave the
08:15 - keyframes at the bottom good practice to
08:17 - do that so your code is organized the
08:19 - next spinner is going to be called or is
08:22 - called spinner dash 2
08:24 - position relative
08:26 - margin 32 all around
08:29 - and
08:30 - display
08:31 - inline block
08:34 - vertical align middle same styles as
08:37 - the top
08:38 - excuse me the top one uh
08:40 - those first four lines 16 pixels width
08:43 - 16 pixels height and then we're gonna do
08:46 - border radius
08:47 - this is where i had the problem last
08:48 - time i just wrote border instead of
08:50 - border radius 16 pixels
08:52 - background color
08:54 - three two three
08:56 - b four zero
08:58 - cool and now
08:59 - uh we're gonna
09:01 - save that and see if it does anything
09:03 - okay i call
09:05 - silly brad i said spinner one you
09:07 - probably caught that spinner two
09:10 - there we go so we have a dot we have a
09:12 - nice circle
09:14 - let's continue
09:15 - now i'm gonna say spinner dash two
09:19 - before pseudo-element and spinner dash 2
09:23 - after pseudo element
09:25 - position absolute
09:28 - display inline block
09:30 - vertical align middle
09:33 - height
09:34 - 16 pixels
09:36 - width 16 pixels
09:38 - border radius 16 pixels background color
09:43 - inherit
09:45 - content of course we need the content
09:46 - i'm gonna put that at the top
09:48 - i like it having right after position
09:50 - there we go
09:53 - and
09:54 - that's going to
09:56 - you're not going to see anything it's
09:57 - just creating the the sizes of the
10:00 - elements i don't think you're actually
10:02 - going to see it in fact no we don't see
10:04 - anything yet and we don't see anything
10:06 - yet because the position is
10:08 - absolute and we haven't given it any
10:11 - left or we haven't transformed it or
10:13 - moved it along the x-axis
10:16 - at all so it's actually just hiding
10:17 - behind this circle so they are there
10:19 - just hiding so that's where we're
10:21 - actually going to start animating
10:24 - so now i'm going to say spinner dash 2
10:26 - before i'm going to animate the before
10:29 - circle and i'm going to say transform
10:31 - and we're going to go translate x
10:34 - and that's going we're going to bring it
10:35 - 120
10:39 - that way
10:40 - so negative 120
10:42 - and so let's save that and
10:45 - cool okay so now what we're going to do
10:47 - is we're going to say transform origin
10:50 - so this lets you modify the origin for
10:52 - transformation so you can transform you
10:54 - can move where the origin of the element
10:56 - is so meaning like are you transforming
10:58 - from the center the top left the top
11:00 - right or any
11:01 - anywhere around the element itself you
11:04 - can see bottom center left top right you
11:06 - can actually use numeric values as well
11:09 - so let's go 32 pixels and so that's x
11:13 - and then y which
11:15 - is gonna be important
11:17 - once we start our animation so we're
11:19 - gonna call the first
11:20 - animation orbit dash one over one second
11:23 - let's do it infinite and linear to keep
11:26 - it safe
11:27 - and now we need to create that animation
11:30 - keyframe
11:32 - do it down here at the bottom keyframes
11:34 - and let's call it uh what we said we
11:37 - would orbit one
11:39 - zero percent we're going to say
11:41 - transform translate x we're going to go
11:45 - we're going to start at negative 120
11:47 - percent
11:48 - and
11:49 - we're going to rotate it 180 degrees so
11:52 - at zero percent that's its first
11:56 - step in the timeline
11:58 - then at
12:00 - let's do 30
12:02 - of the way through
12:05 - let's change the rotate to zero degrees
12:07 - and leave the translate at there at one
12:10 - negative 120. we're gonna go 70 percent
12:13 - the translate will remain the same
12:16 - and the rotate will stay at zero in fact
12:18 - we're going to leave it there for
12:21 - for that portion as well
12:23 - and then one more here translate x
12:26 - uh we're gonna go to negative 180
12:28 - degrees let's see
12:30 - what we just created okay interesting
12:32 - not quite where we're trying to get as
12:34 - you can see here this is kind of more
12:35 - what we're
12:37 - trying to get to
12:39 - so
12:41 - we got our orbit one infinite linear and
12:44 - what did we do 30 70 oh
12:47 - that's the problem 100
12:49 - we're gonna bring it back around so now
12:51 - let's save that
12:52 - there we go so it swings around and it
12:55 - goes as you can see do you see how it
12:57 - swings wide
12:58 - out here the reason why it does that is
13:01 - because this is where you can see this
13:03 - coming into play the transform origin if
13:05 - i take this out and save it watch what's
13:07 - going to happen in fact the transform or
13:09 - it doesn't even do anything let's say 10
13:11 - pixels 10 pixels just to okay you see
13:13 - how that's working transfer it needs a
13:15 - transform origin in order to for us to
13:19 - animate that transform
13:20 - if i just left it at nothing it's
13:23 - actually it is actually rotating
13:26 - but you can't see it rotate because it's
13:27 - just a black circle
13:30 - so
13:31 - you know you can actually see that it's
13:32 - working so we actually do have to have a
13:34 - transform origin if i did 10 pixels and
13:36 - 10 pixels on the x and y it's going from
13:38 - top and left so it's going to be
13:39 - rotating around that
13:41 - that point so there's actually a
13:44 - tympanus.net
13:45 - tympanus.net i don't really know how to
13:47 - pronounce that uh great website though
13:50 - you could see the transform origin by
13:51 - default is center center you can go
13:54 - you can go top center you can go bottom
13:56 - center and you can do specific
14:00 - points like we did 10 pixels and 10
14:01 - pixels and it will rotate it based on
14:03 - that point as if you put put a pin
14:06 - in in an object and then you spun it
14:08 - around that pin
14:09 - so that's kind of what we're doing here
14:11 - so we want to go back to our
14:13 - 32 pixels and
14:17 - 50
14:18 - and that's gonna allow it to spin on a
14:20 - very unusual axis
14:23 - so that it creates that effect okay so
14:25 - that means we are now on to the next one
14:28 - so let's style the after pseudo element
14:30 - spinner dash 2
14:32 - after
14:34 - and what we're going to do here is we're
14:36 - simply
14:37 - let's copy this one
14:39 - and just change a few of the values just
14:41 - to save some typing
14:43 - transform we're going to make this one
14:45 - 120 so it's on the other side this is
14:48 - going to be a half 16 pixel negative 16
14:51 - pixels and 50 so that when it spins
14:53 - around it's going to do the opposite
14:56 - effect and we can't use orbit 1 because
14:59 - it's going to do
15:00 - it's going to do that which is really
15:01 - weird
15:03 - unusual stuff we're creating here so we
15:05 - need to create an orbit 2 and do the
15:08 - invert
15:09 - inverted version of orbit one so copy
15:12 - that
15:13 - paste it out we're going to call it
15:14 - orbit two and we're going to start at
15:16 - instead of the negative values all just
15:18 - gonna be inverted so
15:20 - if it's a negative it's a positive it's
15:21 - a positive it's a negative so negative
15:22 - 120 now becomes 120 180 now becomes
15:25 - negative 180 like so so now this would
15:28 - be positive and leave those there
15:30 - that should do
15:33 - that should do the trick
15:36 - i might have i might let's see
15:40 - okay so now i don't want them to do that
15:41 - it's actually
15:43 - they're just like
15:44 - they're like doing like a big like high
15:46 - fives or something
15:48 - let's make this one negative 180.
15:50 - they're
15:52 - odd
15:54 - okay
15:56 - those are spinning
16:00 - i like this that we're trying to figure
16:02 - this out together figure out some
16:04 - problems together
16:06 - i
16:06 - at this present moment i'm trying to
16:08 - understand
16:10 - why it did it's doing this that is very
16:13 - odd
16:15 - let's take k let's take out orbit two i
16:18 - just want to see what orbit one is doing
16:20 - orbit one is doing what we want
16:22 - yes orbit two
16:26 - is it start
16:27 - orbit two okay wait wait
16:29 - let's
16:30 - wrote okay
16:32 - i was wrong when i said switch all the
16:34 - values to negative and positive the
16:35 - translate needs to switch so that now
16:37 - orbit two is all positive values but
16:41 - up here we started like this we have the
16:44 - rotates
16:45 - we're going to rotate it the exact same
16:48 - just from the different side awesome and
16:51 - there they are spinning in the proper
16:53 - direction
16:54 - and we have example number one swirling
16:56 - around shrinking as it gets to the top
16:58 - that looks awesome so there we go we've
16:59 - got our css only spinners that are
17:03 - animating and that's just a couple
17:05 - examples you can literally create
17:06 - whatever you want as a spinner maybe how
17:10 - about this challenge for you create a
17:12 - third example a third spinner and make
17:15 - it
17:16 - literally whatever you want it could be
17:17 - a spinning square it could be three
17:19 - spinning squares it could be something
17:21 - that's bouncing across the screen you
17:23 - could you could do whatever you want for
17:25 - a spinner could be very simple very
17:26 - complex very unusual you could combine
17:29 - these animations and do something very
17:31 - very uh quirky totally up to you so try
17:34 - that out exercise some css transforms
17:38 - and key frames and animations and see
17:40 - what you can come up with thanks for
17:41 - joining me today on day number 21 see
17:43 - you tomorrow in day number 22.
17:46 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up everybody welcome back to css3 in 30 days today's day number 21 and we're going to be coding up some animated css only spinners let's check it out animated spinners right here day number 21 we're going to be making these right here spinners what would you use a spinner for when you're loading content when you're loading a page you know when you're loading an application an image that's where you'd use a spinner you see it quite often in websites applications software uh it's simply or watching videos even the spinner just indicates that something is happening something is loading and it's uh they're kind of fascinating to look at and these are only made in or these are made in css3 only so let's jump in and get started here in our code editor we're going to go ahead and download day number 21 spinners i'm gonna give you a second to do that in fact you could just pause the video go ahead and do that and i'm just gonna show you a couple things so here's the index file html is very simple it's simply a div with the class of spinner one and a dip with the class of spinner two that's it let's jump into our sandbox and get coding our css first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna select spinner dash one and we're gonna give it a position of relative display of inline block vertical line of middle and now we're going to give it a width 64 pixels and height 64 pixels and a border radius of 64 pixels you could also say 100 that should do the trick but 64 pixels means it is going to be if the border raises border radius for 64 pixels and it's the same as width and height then it's gonna be perfect circle all right if we save that you probably shouldn't actually see anything at this point you just see an empty space that's 64 by 64. beauty now we're going to do is we're going to say spinner dash 1 and the before sudo position absolute we got to give it a content of an empty string of course and width whoops width of 64 pixels height of 64 pixels and a border radius again 64 pixels we're going to give it a color of 3 2 3 and this is the text color 323b40 but here's the thing there's going to be no text but we're going to be using an interesting css value called current color it's kind of like a css variable so watch this if i were to go box shadow inset negative 5 pixels 0 0 and then 5 pixels and then current color that's going to grab the actual color so it's kind of like you set a variable so i'm going to save that check it out in the browser you can see the current color is that gray because it's grabbing current color if i were to remove this i'm not really sure what would happen it looks like it would be it's grabbing the text color uh it's inheriting the text color from the body but if i were to change this to red the current color should be red so that's how that works right there pretty fun little css trick there and now we're going to do is we're going to clip this shape this unusual shape we just made to a rectangle but we're going to actually define the values here 0 64 pixels comma 32 pixels comma 0. that will give us this shape here again kind of weird but hang with me it's kind of like a like a like an 8bit hockey stick hanging upside down but watch this we're going to actually say border radius oh here's the problem oh there we go border radius i thought i already added that but i didn't do it properly border 864 so this hockey stick shape is actually going to now get this shape here that looks a lot nicer so you can see what the border radius did to change that so this this shape there without the border radius actually kind of looks like it's very unusual the right side of it is thicker the top side of it is is a bit thinner and long but the border radius really gives it a nice feel and you can almost see now how that's going to turn in you know how that's going to look when we spin it so now we're going to do is say animation we're going to give the animation name of rotator uh one second infinitely linear in fact i want to ease it i think that might be let's see what that looks like and now we need to create a keyframe so keyframes it's called rotator rotator at zero percent we're going to say transform and we're going to rotate it 180 degrees and let's uh say 50 we're gonna go rotate to transform whoops transform rotate back to zero degrees and then 100 we're gonna do back to 180 degrees let's see what that does interesting very interesting okay this the first one actually needs to be negative 180 degrees but i'm gonna try something here okay so do you see because i have an ease it's actually doing this like jump jump jump jump if i make it linear let's see it should just be spinning exactly but now i'm wondering if i just started at zero let's just try something start at zero and i just say 100 we spin at 360. it should still do the same thing yeah and now i can do ease i like that it's kind of neat so let's try that okay but now what i want to do is i wanted to also animate the box shadow and we're going to say inset negative 5 pixels 0 0 5 pixels current color that's in fact the same box shadows right now but we need to set it to this because what i want to do is now make a very uh variant make a variation of it so box shadow at okay this is where i might need let's try this negative one and then one let's see what that looks like very weird so here's where i'm going to actually throw that 50 back in there and i'm going to transform the whole thing i'm going to say 180 degrees here starts at 0 to 180 degrees and then 360. and i'm going to do this box shadow at 50 i'm going to do this and then at 100 i'm going to go back to this that should give me an interesting effect okay it does do something it's kind of like a we're doing some weird stuff here folks we're gonna change this back to linear that should probably make there we go so there we go so you see how as it goes around it gets thinner and then thicker thinner and thicker it's kind of neat looks like a tadpole in a way now i don't like how it's thin on the side i kind of want to get thin at the top so that's where i'm going to go back here to zero percent i'm going to say negative 180 degrees to start at then it's gonna go spin to zero degrees at the top which will make it thin at the top and then i'm going to bring it to 180 degrees here that is going to change where it gets smaller at the top yep i like that that looks good there's our first rotator now let's go down to the next spinner so i'm going to leave the keyframes at the bottom good practice to do that so your code is organized the next spinner is going to be called or is called spinner dash 2 position relative margin 32 all around and display inline block vertical align middle same styles as the top excuse me the top one uh those first four lines 16 pixels width 16 pixels height and then we're gonna do border radius this is where i had the problem last time i just wrote border instead of border radius 16 pixels background color three two three b four zero cool and now uh we're gonna save that and see if it does anything okay i call silly brad i said spinner one you probably caught that spinner two there we go so we have a dot we have a nice circle let's continue now i'm gonna say spinner dash two before pseudoelement and spinner dash 2 after pseudo element position absolute display inline block vertical align middle height 16 pixels width 16 pixels border radius 16 pixels background color inherit content of course we need the content i'm gonna put that at the top i like it having right after position there we go and that's going to you're not going to see anything it's just creating the the sizes of the elements i don't think you're actually going to see it in fact no we don't see anything yet and we don't see anything yet because the position is absolute and we haven't given it any left or we haven't transformed it or moved it along the xaxis at all so it's actually just hiding behind this circle so they are there just hiding so that's where we're actually going to start animating so now i'm going to say spinner dash 2 before i'm going to animate the before circle and i'm going to say transform and we're going to go translate x and that's going we're going to bring it 120 that way so negative 120 and so let's save that and cool okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to say transform origin so this lets you modify the origin for transformation so you can transform you can move where the origin of the element is so meaning like are you transforming from the center the top left the top right or any anywhere around the element itself you can see bottom center left top right you can actually use numeric values as well so let's go 32 pixels and so that's x and then y which is gonna be important once we start our animation so we're gonna call the first animation orbit dash one over one second let's do it infinite and linear to keep it safe and now we need to create that animation keyframe do it down here at the bottom keyframes and let's call it uh what we said we would orbit one zero percent we're going to say transform translate x we're going to go we're going to start at negative 120 percent and we're going to rotate it 180 degrees so at zero percent that's its first step in the timeline then at let's do 30 of the way through let's change the rotate to zero degrees and leave the translate at there at one negative 120. we're gonna go 70 percent the translate will remain the same and the rotate will stay at zero in fact we're going to leave it there for for that portion as well and then one more here translate x uh we're gonna go to negative 180 degrees let's see what we just created okay interesting not quite where we're trying to get as you can see here this is kind of more what we're trying to get to so we got our orbit one infinite linear and what did we do 30 70 oh that's the problem 100 we're gonna bring it back around so now let's save that there we go so it swings around and it goes as you can see do you see how it swings wide out here the reason why it does that is because this is where you can see this coming into play the transform origin if i take this out and save it watch what's going to happen in fact the transform or it doesn't even do anything let's say 10 pixels 10 pixels just to okay you see how that's working transfer it needs a transform origin in order to for us to animate that transform if i just left it at nothing it's actually it is actually rotating but you can't see it rotate because it's just a black circle so you know you can actually see that it's working so we actually do have to have a transform origin if i did 10 pixels and 10 pixels on the x and y it's going from top and left so it's going to be rotating around that that point so there's actually a tympanus.net tympanus.net i don't really know how to pronounce that uh great website though you could see the transform origin by default is center center you can go you can go top center you can go bottom center and you can do specific points like we did 10 pixels and 10 pixels and it will rotate it based on that point as if you put put a pin in in an object and then you spun it around that pin so that's kind of what we're doing here so we want to go back to our 32 pixels and 50 and that's gonna allow it to spin on a very unusual axis so that it creates that effect okay so that means we are now on to the next one so let's style the after pseudo element spinner dash 2 after and what we're going to do here is we're simply let's copy this one and just change a few of the values just to save some typing transform we're going to make this one 120 so it's on the other side this is going to be a half 16 pixel negative 16 pixels and 50 so that when it spins around it's going to do the opposite effect and we can't use orbit 1 because it's going to do it's going to do that which is really weird unusual stuff we're creating here so we need to create an orbit 2 and do the invert inverted version of orbit one so copy that paste it out we're going to call it orbit two and we're going to start at instead of the negative values all just gonna be inverted so if it's a negative it's a positive it's a positive it's a negative so negative 120 now becomes 120 180 now becomes negative 180 like so so now this would be positive and leave those there that should do that should do the trick i might have i might let's see okay so now i don't want them to do that it's actually they're just like they're like doing like a big like high fives or something let's make this one negative 180. they're odd okay those are spinning i like this that we're trying to figure this out together figure out some problems together i at this present moment i'm trying to understand why it did it's doing this that is very odd let's take k let's take out orbit two i just want to see what orbit one is doing orbit one is doing what we want yes orbit two is it start orbit two okay wait wait let's wrote okay i was wrong when i said switch all the values to negative and positive the translate needs to switch so that now orbit two is all positive values but up here we started like this we have the rotates we're going to rotate it the exact same just from the different side awesome and there they are spinning in the proper direction and we have example number one swirling around shrinking as it gets to the top that looks awesome so there we go we've got our css only spinners that are animating and that's just a couple examples you can literally create whatever you want as a spinner maybe how about this challenge for you create a third example a third spinner and make it literally whatever you want it could be a spinning square it could be three spinning squares it could be something that's bouncing across the screen you could you could do whatever you want for a spinner could be very simple very complex very unusual you could combine these animations and do something very very uh quirky totally up to you so try that out exercise some css transforms and key frames and animations and see what you can come up with thanks for joining me today on day number 21 see you tomorrow in day number 22.
