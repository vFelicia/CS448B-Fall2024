00:00 - let's see how you can create a password
00:02 - field in HTML we create the label and
00:06 - input elements in our HTML file we add
00:09 - an ID attribute to the input element and
00:12 - a four attribute to the label element
00:14 - let's see what happens if we use the
00:17 - value text for the type attribute in our
00:20 - input element everything we write is
00:23 - clearly visible and that is exactly what
00:25 - we don't want so how can we fix this we
00:28 - just need to update the type attribute
00:31 - to the value password and this will
00:34 - create a password input field where
00:36 - everything we write is hidden now if we
00:39 - write our password we just see a
00:42 - sequence of dots and some browsers might
00:45 - even display asterisks instead of dots
00:48 - but either way your password will be
00:51 - hidden and that's how you can do this in
00:53 - HTML
