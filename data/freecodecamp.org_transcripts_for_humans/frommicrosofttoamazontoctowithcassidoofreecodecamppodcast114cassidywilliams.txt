00:03 - [Music]
00:26 - welcome back to the free Cod Camp
00:28 - podcast each week we talk with
00:30 - developers entrepreneurs and ambitious
00:33 - people who are getting into Tech this
00:34 - week I'm joined by Cassidy Williams AKA
00:39 - cassid do Hello thank you for having me
00:43 - yeah we're thrilled to have you here
00:44 - cassid where does that name come from
00:46 - that's your handle on Twitter and Tik
00:48 - Tok and all the things uh it came from
00:51 - my mom actually she would say like how
00:53 - do you do cassad do and I picked it as a
00:56 - username in college and it just kind of
00:57 - stuck everywhere awesome awesome yeah
01:00 - and everywhere indeed that's one of the
01:02 - things I want to just start off by
01:03 - talking about like how you are
01:06 - ubiquities I can't really even think of
01:08 - any developers who are on more platforms
01:11 - and and like putting out more stuff than
01:14 - you so just some quick background on
01:16 - Cassidy she's been a developer for more
01:19 - than a decade she's worked at tons of
01:21 - big companies she's worked at lots of
01:22 - small companies as well she's currently
01:24 - the CTO of a tech startup uh so yeah
01:29 - let's talk about all these places you
01:31 - are so you I guess my first exposure to
01:34 - you was maybe like four or five years
01:36 - ago like watching the short kind of Tik
01:38 - Tok videos and hearing about this
01:40 - developer who was like Making Waves on
01:42 - Tik Tok on the talk right I don't use
01:45 - Tik Tok myself uh I watch Like These two
01:47 - or three hour long video essays on
01:49 - YouTube and stuff but uh certainly a lot
01:52 - of people were sharing it and it was
01:53 - also making its way onto Twitter and
01:55 - like Reddit and places like that that I
01:56 - would normally see it so maybe you can
01:59 - talk about like content creation and
02:02 - like how you became so prolific with
02:04 - your crazy you know Dad joke humor my
02:08 - memes yeah your memes yeah yeah and so I
02:12 - feel like I always made memes but Tik
02:14 - Tok just made it easier to make more um
02:17 - where I I even loved making videos a ton
02:21 - just when I was young but video editing
02:23 - takes time uh as you probably know and
02:25 - so I I kind of stopped but it was always
02:28 - like a fun thing that I did um and then
02:32 - yeah when I when I got Tic Tac I was
02:33 - like wow this editor is so easy and I
02:35 - just started recording silly ones that I
02:38 - had ideas for back in I think it was
02:40 - like mid 2019 when I started and things
02:43 - kind of exploded from there I never
02:44 - intended to be a content creator it was
02:46 - just kind of me joking around about the
02:49 - state of development and went from there
02:52 - yeah so maybe talking a little bit about
02:54 - content Creation in general like what
02:57 - are some of the
03:00 - cassid do memes that people may have
03:02 - seen like the the short videos like is
03:04 - there one that it just like completely
03:06 - blew up that you were like wow like I
03:09 - had no idea this many people would
03:11 - appreciate this developer humor yeah I
03:14 - think this was like the second or third
03:16 - one I made where it was me singing the
03:19 - song Impossible from a Cinderella movie
03:22 - where it's just someone repeating
03:24 - impossible a bunch of times and it's
03:25 - when your code works on the first try
03:28 - and it was just a bunch of people going
03:29 - like impossible impossible and it just
03:32 - keeps repeating it and it's true because
03:35 - you should always be suspicious if your
03:37 - code just works on the first try it's
03:39 - also you're also like o I'm a genius but
03:41 - also I'm probably not what's going on um
03:44 - so I think that one related a lot and
03:46 - then I also uh I do a Halloween Tik Tok
03:50 - every year where I admit I don't make as
03:52 - many as I do as I did before because I
03:55 - just have less time but I still always
03:57 - do one on Halloween where I do a CSS
04:00 - trick and I hide the word boo somewhere
04:03 - in the Tik Tok at some point and uh as
04:07 - you do the CSS trick the word boo
04:09 - appears and I scream at the end that
04:11 - that one I feel like a lot of people
04:13 - they're just like I look forward to this
04:14 - one every year because I can't figure
04:16 - out what it is until I see it and so
04:18 - that one's pretty fun too yeah
04:20 - interesting so you kind of like
04:23 - recurring uh themes and Rec even like
04:26 - recurring kind of inside jokes from the
04:28 - cassid C
04:30 - Universe yeah there there's some where I
04:32 - definitely it's like such a specific
04:35 - joke where I'm just like hm there's
04:36 - maybe 10 people in the world who will
04:38 - actually get this joke but it's funny to
04:40 - me so I'm going to do it anyway where
04:42 - like one of them was very specifically a
04:44 - reference to the Dream Girls Musical and
04:46 - then if you know that Musical and the
04:49 - lyrics that I am singing in there and
04:51 - you know react and how the use effect
04:53 - hook works it's a really funny joke and
04:57 - it like combines the two of them but
04:59 - yeah there the people who got it they're
05:01 - like oh my gosh this is so specific but
05:03 - this is hilarious and then everyone else
05:04 - is
05:05 - like good
05:07 - job you know that the definitely a lot
05:11 - of them are Hit or Miss but it's it's
05:12 - fun to just kind of laugh at a very
05:14 - serious industry sometimes like as a
05:17 - very amateurish dad joke and I only do
05:19 - it among family you're not going to see
05:21 - me trying to crack dad jokes generally
05:23 - in like the free C Camp newsletter or on
05:25 - the free C Camp podcast or right
05:27 - anywhere where you get your weekly do
05:29 - Quincy Larson right um I am very scared
05:33 - of just like getting the Crickets effect
05:35 - because I was like too many references
05:37 - deep and like at what point does a joke
05:39 - become too esoteric and you're like I
05:42 - really don't have confidence that this
05:44 - is going to land with even like one out
05:46 - of every 10 people that like do you have
05:49 - like some heuristics that you use when I
05:51 - just make the joke anyway cuz if I'm
05:54 - laughing at it I know that I can have a
05:56 - good time and and like there there's
05:59 - some specific people who like my husband
06:01 - or my sister or something they will all
06:03 - they will always be just like oh my gosh
06:05 - that was dumb but I know exactly what
06:06 - you're referencing and so like I I I've
06:09 - got a few people in in my back pocket
06:11 - where I can be like you'll laugh at this
06:13 - and then most people where they're just
06:14 - like no Cassidy I'm okay with that I
06:17 - just kind of make the joke anyway yeah
06:19 - so to some extent like you can be your
06:21 - own barometer of relevance and trust
06:24 - that your life is experience is
06:26 - overlapped with enough other people that
06:28 - like you know you've got some audience
06:31 - out there that is going to appreciate it
06:33 - and sometimes like the most geeky if I
06:36 - can use that term like of humor it
06:39 - brings people together who feel like I
06:41 - thought I was the only one who was
06:43 - interested in Doctor Who and right or
06:46 - who had this experience or something
06:48 - like that yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly or
06:51 - like greatest showman in typescript or
06:53 - something like that like yeah you you
06:56 - never know who it might work for and at
06:58 - the same time if anything future me will
07:01 - laugh at the joke and so I I make the
07:03 - joke anyway awesome yeah that's a great
07:06 - Philosophy for being is just like I have
07:09 - faith that other people are going to be
07:12 - similar enough to me in some specific
07:14 - way that like it'll it'll work
07:17 - out I want to talk so I mean there's so
07:20 - many things we can talk about because
07:21 - there's just so many interesting
07:22 - Dimensions to you uh but one thing that
07:25 - is really interesting is just the extent
07:28 - to which you put yourself out there
07:30 - there are plenty of people who got a CS
07:32 - degree a computer science degree from
07:33 - like a good Public University here in
07:35 - the US and got good jobs at developers
07:38 - maybe got an uh internship in Microsoft
07:41 - right those coveted internships in big
07:44 - Tech that you got as a university
07:46 - student and they're just like cool I'm
07:49 - set I can write my own ticket I can get
07:51 - on the train and
07:53 - just enjoy my hobbies and work you know
07:56 - a reasonable amount of work and you know
07:58 - eventually retire and I can just be a
08:00 - professional Dev like I I suspect a lot
08:03 - of people go into like Fields like
08:04 - Dentistry or medicine or maybe even law
08:07 - just because they are remunerative
08:09 - stable careers where people are always
08:11 - going to have cavities you know like
08:14 - dentist are not going to go yeah yeah
08:16 - they'll always have teeth maybe they
08:17 - won't always have cavities but get the
08:20 - nanites in there cleaning the teeth for
08:21 - us but
08:23 - um a lot of people choose CS precisely
08:26 - because it's a stable income if they're
08:28 - like a first generation American or
08:30 - second generation and and they've got a
08:31 - lot of family to take care of like yeah
08:34 - uh for example a significant chunk of
08:36 - the Indian economy historically has been
08:38 - doctors Engineers people that are living
08:41 - in the United States who are making a
08:42 - lot of money and then remitting a lot of
08:44 - that back to their families their
08:46 - extended families I'm married to an
08:48 - immigrant so that's very real yeah I am
08:52 - too uh my wife uh uh she actually
08:55 - immigrated after we met in graduate
08:57 - school and we got married
08:59 - uh almost 20 years ago and then we moved
09:02 - back to the us and we went through the
09:03 - lengthy Green Card process and then the
09:06 - naturalization process she's a US
09:08 - citizen today uh but but yeah
09:11 - like I could totally understand if
09:13 - you're coming from that perspective of
09:15 - you didn't grow up you know middle class
09:18 - in like New York City or Los Angeles or
09:20 - something and you don't really have a
09:21 - lot to fall back on just getting a safe
09:23 - career like frankly being a developer is
09:26 - basically the safest career you can get
09:28 - in this sense that like I always like to
09:31 - say the Act of automating things is the
09:34 - last thing that will be completely
09:35 - automated and software Engineers are
09:37 - doing the automation so by definition
09:39 - like they'll be that's the last job that
09:41 - will ever exist probably right um but
09:44 - you have not rested on your laurels and
09:47 - you have not just checked out and just
09:49 - focused on you know living the good life
09:51 - and and making a lot of money as a
09:52 - developer and having cool creative you
09:54 - know self-actualizing work you've gone
09:57 - out there and you know put your
09:59 - reputation and like all this stuff on
10:01 - the line by attempting to make funny
10:03 - jokes on the internet where people might
10:05 - be mean to you
10:07 - right yeah what what drove you to do
10:10 - that so it wasn't so much me just being
10:14 - like I'm going to be funny and who cares
10:16 - what people say I think it was more just
10:20 - I a lot of the stuff that I do put out
10:23 - there I want to make Tech more
10:25 - accessible in general and so like I have
10:27 - a Weekly Newsletter and every single
10:29 - week I share like weekly links and a
10:32 - practice coding question and with the
10:34 - jokes I want Tech to not be as scary
10:37 - because honestly it's a very very
10:39 - serious industry that like you deal with
10:41 - certain bugs and you might think I'm the
10:43 - only one who's dealt with this and
10:45 - you're not like whe whether it's the
10:47 - paranoia of your manager calling you
10:49 - into a meeting or just your code not
10:52 - working on the first try or you suddenly
10:54 - saying like oh I I'll never be
10:56 - interested in some language and then you
10:58 - try it you're like wait I am it's
11:00 - amazing and and there there there's so
11:02 - many different things where uh I think
11:05 - especially in the pandemic so many
11:07 - people were very very isolated and uh a
11:10 - lot of the work that I've done it
11:12 - started pre- pandemic but continued and
11:14 - and I went a bit harder on it to try to
11:17 - provide resources to people that I wish
11:18 - I had when I was learning yeah so that
11:21 - that's a big idus is like I want to make
11:24 - sure people have resources that I wish I
11:26 - had when I was
11:27 - learning yeah I mean it's very similar
11:30 - to free obviously like I learned code
11:32 - you can probably relate yeah um so was
11:36 - that the main reason is just like
11:38 - because a lot of the things you're doing
11:40 - like you're putting out learning
11:41 - resources and you know I would consider
11:43 - you an educator even though it sounds
11:44 - like you're mainly like an I mean you're
11:46 - I guess uh you worked in developer
11:49 - myself as an educator too so yeah yeah
11:54 - so I guess what were your roots in
11:58 - wanting to do that of course you start
11:59 - with this abstract goal I want to make
12:01 - it easier for people who are going
12:03 - through a journey similar to my own what
12:06 - what were the early days of content
12:08 - creation Cassidy like yeah content
12:11 - creation Cassidy who is she um I first
12:16 - started let's let me think I guess when
12:18 - I was in college I that's when I started
12:21 - doing things like uh being a TA for
12:25 - people or or a peer mentor for for
12:27 - people when I say ta teacher assistant
12:29 - and kind of just helping other students
12:31 - and stuff and um even earlier than that
12:35 - uh I we're going way back in high school
12:37 - when I was first getting interested in
12:40 - coding and stuff and there was no free
12:42 - code camp or anything like that at that
12:44 - point for me where I was just kind of
12:46 - like blindly trying to code uh and learn
12:48 - things I got involved with an
12:49 - organization called ncwit the national
12:52 - Center for Women and it and they were so
12:55 - helpful not so much to be just like this
12:58 - is how you code but like they got me
13:00 - connected to a lot of people who are so
13:01 - helpful to be just like this is
13:03 - something you should know or or like
13:04 - this is this is a thing that you should
13:06 - talk about or this is a thing that you
13:08 - should remember um just mentors even if
13:12 - it was just a a one hour mentorship
13:15 - session or or just something in passing
13:18 - and I think just being engaged with them
13:22 - from an early age just because I truly
13:25 - randomly saw their website and I was
13:27 - like I should try to apply for a SC
13:29 - um it it kind of just snowballed from
13:32 - there where uh one of the mentors that I
13:35 - had said lift as you climb where just as
13:37 - you move up in the industry you should
13:39 - try to lift other others up with you um
13:42 - and because as you move up in your role
13:45 - or somewhere there's going to be someone
13:47 - filling in the space behind you at all
13:49 - times and and it just benefits everyone
13:52 - over time um and yeah I think that was
13:54 - just something that hit me hard early
13:57 - and I kind of just rolled with it where
14:00 - after being super involved in high
14:02 - school and in college with NC Wht and I
14:03 - still am to this day not as much as I
14:06 - used to be but I do like resume
14:08 - workshops with them and stuff um it it
14:12 - just kind of snowballed where I was like
14:14 - oh well now that I'm in college I can
14:15 - give talks to high school students so
14:17 - that way they know like what to major in
14:18 - in college and I wrote blogs for my
14:21 - college to on like what the computer
14:23 - science major is like and then I started
14:27 - to like do aot of networking and meeting
14:29 - with people especially at internships
14:31 - and stuff in college and then from there
14:34 - as I got to see people in the industry
14:37 - before graduating I saw so many people
14:39 - where they were coding but they weren't
14:41 - just coding and I was like you know I
14:43 - like the idea of coding but not just
14:45 - coding and seeing what that could be and
14:47 - that led me to start doing Dev advocacy
14:49 - and stuff and the again it kind of just
14:52 - snowball where from there I was just
14:54 - like okay I'll go to hackathons and be a
14:55 - mentor okay and then from there I'll
14:57 - speak at conference and maybe teach some
14:59 - people things and then I started
15:02 - teaching online classes and I first
15:04 - started my newsletter because I thought
15:06 - oh I could teach people on the side of
15:08 - my online classes promote my online
15:09 - classes but then also help people out
15:11 - and so it just kind of kept growing over
15:14 - time where it it started with people
15:16 - helping me and then me realizing I
15:18 - should help others as well wow yeah it
15:22 - it sounds like you had uh a lot of
15:24 - people that were very inspiring to you
15:27 - and that you got hooked up early on with
15:29 - people who were kind of in your corner
15:31 - and could relate to a lot of the
15:33 - challenges you were facing and uh that I
15:37 - love what you said like lift as you
15:38 - climb that's such an amazing like I mean
15:41 - makes sense from like a rock climbing
15:42 - thing like you might have two people
15:43 - that are tethered together and like so
15:46 - you you climb up and and they're there
15:48 - to like help you in case you fall like
15:50 - they're provide some security because
15:52 - they're also connected to the wall and
15:53 - stuff I mean I've never
15:57 - G
15:59 - there's so many people where they
16:00 - probably don't realize the impact that
16:02 - they had on me where it was just like
16:05 - one person was an upper classman just at
16:07 - my school where where she was just
16:10 - helpful enough I was just like okay I'm
16:12 - going to listen to what she said and and
16:15 - the sometimes you never know like what
16:18 - small pieces of advice will hit and then
16:20 - carry you on and and that uh that kind
16:24 - of stuff I want to be able to provide
16:25 - advice that I wish I had um to as many
16:28 - people as I can yeah yeah and it sounds
16:31 - like you're reaching a lot of people
16:32 - just to put things in context like the
16:35 - degree of impact you're having uh not
16:37 - just as a developer not just as a CTO
16:39 - developer Advocate but creating courses
16:42 - teaching people how to code um you've
16:45 - got a ton of people of course watching
16:48 - your Tik Tok videos and by extension you
16:50 - know the videos are cross posted on
16:51 - Twitter I often see them like like
16:54 - you've got the pinned C locks oh yeah I
16:57 - encourage everybody to check out the the
16:59 - link to Cassidy's Twitter uh Cassidy's
17:02 - Twitter in the uh in the show notes
17:04 - because uh just checking out that one
17:06 - it's just you play all these different
17:08 - characters and and that's one of the
17:10 - things I don't know if that's like a Tik
17:11 - Tok thing but it'll be like one person
17:13 - playing like all these different roles
17:15 - and uh maybe they're wearing uh like a
17:17 - hat in one or they're wearing many wigs
17:20 - I I I think wigs are so fun and so I'm
17:22 - just like this is a good opportunity to
17:24 - just have a different hat yeah I mean
17:26 - it's it's like a campy way of so
17:28 - economizing like because you don't need
17:30 - to get more people involved you can
17:31 - really DIY it you can literally be this
17:34 - sole writer producer director actress
17:38 - like actor all all those different
17:40 - things in the show and you don't need
17:43 - really anybody's permission to do
17:45 - anything and then you just have like the
17:46 - editing tools you make it and then you
17:47 - you Syndicate it across all these
17:49 - different things of course you've got
17:50 - your newsletter that I'll like I enjoyed
17:53 - reading some of the back issues of it
17:54 - always includes a joke it's worth
17:56 - signing up just for the joke
17:59 - definitely just read it to scroll to the
18:01 - joke yeah yeah I mean at least they're
18:05 - reading it and getting some uh benefit
18:07 - from it yeah yeah hey if anything what's
18:10 - fun is I I used to only do Tech jokes or
18:13 - or like most of them would be Tech jokes
18:15 - but then a bunch of people started
18:16 - saying like thank you so much for these
18:17 - jokes I read it to my grandma every week
18:19 - and I'm just like oh my gosh I'm going
18:20 - to do non- Tech jokes so you can read
18:23 - more to your grandma but uh yeah the
18:26 - jokes are great yeah uh like free C Camp
18:29 - my email every week includes a quote of
18:31 - the week and and recently of course I
18:33 - quoted one of your quotes about like
18:35 - some joke you made about get and uh it
18:37 - it was something about like I don't want
18:40 - to misquote it do you remember I
18:41 - honestly I literally wrote a blog post
18:43 - about get like a half hour before this
18:46 - recording so it could be anything yeah
18:49 - there are lots of like uh puns that you
18:51 - can make around get especially because I
18:53 - I think like there's so many weird mixed
18:55 - analogies in get and so many of the
18:57 - commands it's like like how did you go
18:59 - like get blamed that was a real head
19:00 - scratcher like such a rude way blame
19:03 - someone yeah I I saw someone made like
19:05 - an alias where it was get props and it's
19:07 - the same thing as blame it just makes
19:09 - you feel a little better about it yeah
19:11 - the toxicity of tech is built right into
19:13 - the tools themselves blaming people
19:16 - though um yeah I uh so you also stream
19:21 - on Twitch and I'd be curious to learn I
19:23 - haven't actually watched any of your
19:25 - streams yet I'm hoping to catch them
19:26 - like I don't spend a lot I watch vods on
19:30 - um YouTube that people upload video on
19:32 - demand so I never watch I watch
19:34 - everything on YouTube like double speed
19:36 - it twitch it's just like onx is too slow
19:39 - for me like no offense if anybody here
19:41 - is like finding this conversation
19:42 - dragging a little bit just go and bump
19:44 - the speed a little bit and I promise
19:45 - it's like way more everything is more
19:47 - interesting at 2x um and I do that for
19:50 - all my podcasts like basically every
19:52 - piece of content my wife won't even
19:53 - watch movies with me anymore CU I double
19:55 - speed them um oh gosh movies too
19:58 - sometimes you know it depends on like if
20:00 - it's like you know like a a late night
20:02 - kind of like guilty pleasure like watch
20:04 - of some 8s or a really really really
20:07 - slow movies where it's like we're
20:09 - walking across the sand Blade the new
20:11 - Blade Runner one was slow as heck um it
20:13 - was a good movie but it was
20:15 - slow like man AB some respectful
20:18 - people's time I'm sure like all the the
20:20 - you know filmmakers in the audience are
20:22 - like crying don't you yeah but anyway I
20:26 - do stream yeah talk about that yeah so I
20:29 - and I admit I've slowed down a little
20:31 - bit because I had a baby and it's not as
20:33 - easy to live stream weekly but I've been
20:36 - trying to get back to my regular weekly
20:38 - Cadence of streaming and it kind of
20:40 - started where once again I I thought it
20:42 - might be useful to teach people
20:44 - something and then kind of talk about it
20:45 - and so typically what I would do when I
20:49 - first started streaming um myself I had
20:53 - streamed before like with my sister and
20:54 - stuff Tech things but um I I would talk
20:59 - for like a half hour to an hour about
21:01 - like whatever questions people had
21:03 - jobwise or or technical questions
21:06 - opinions about the latest hot new
21:08 - JavaScript library or something like
21:10 - that and then after that I'd go into
21:12 - some project that was like recurring
21:14 - weekly and everything and I admit I
21:16 - leaned more towards the first part
21:19 - because people were so they had so many
21:21 - questions um for a while until a lot of
21:23 - my stream ended up being mostly just
21:25 - like a Q&A session seeing what like what
21:27 - questions can answer for people or just
21:29 - hang out and co-work um but then yeah
21:32 - some other ones where it's I'll be like
21:34 - I really want to work on this library
21:35 - today so I'm just going to code and I'll
21:38 - check out the chat and see if yall have
21:39 - questions from there but yeah it's it's
21:41 - a very casual stream I I admit I should
21:44 - probably be more like consistent about
21:47 - it there have been times where I'm just
21:48 - like I'm not streaming this week because
21:49 - I have a really good sandwich here's a
21:51 - picture of it see you next week and so
21:53 - like it really just varies from from
21:56 - week to week but uh yeah it's it's fun
21:59 - to just kind of chat with people in the
22:00 - community especially once again it's a
22:03 - very remote World um especially uh post
22:06 - pandemic we're still kind of in it eh um
22:09 - and and being able to interact with
22:11 - people in the community yeah yeah so
22:14 - being out there especially like real
22:16 - time communicating with chat and uh as
22:19 - you're on stream like doing Q&A sessions
22:21 - or just live coding and answering
22:22 - people's questions as they fire them in
22:25 - uh I did stream for like a couple years
22:28 - years uh while I was building a lot of
22:30 - the early versions of free Cod camp but
22:32 - it just um I got some the same question
22:35 - so many times over and over I'm like I'm
22:37 - just going to write articles and writing
22:39 - articles like I I got a lot more I guess
22:41 - help helped a lot of people more a lot
22:44 - definitely I I have like an ask me
22:46 - anything repo on GitHub you can go to
22:48 - cast.
22:49 - run um I I have like an ask me anything
22:51 - repo where it's like frequently asked
22:53 - questions and then also yeah if I get a
22:55 - question repeatedly I'm just like okay
22:57 - I'll write a blog and then I can just
22:58 - kind of link it to people so I don't
22:59 - have to keep me saying it what questions
23:01 - do people ask I'm just curious like what
23:04 - would be the most asked question about
23:06 - you that is not specific to like how do
23:09 - I get you know fix get detached head or
23:11 - something but like not a technical
23:13 - question but just a question about you
23:15 - in general yeah um I should pull up my
23:18 - repo but uh let's see people often ask
23:21 - like startups versus big companies
23:23 - people often ask like should I get a
23:25 - computer science degree um they often
23:29 - ask what mechanical keyboard should I
23:31 - buy yeah uh what's it like being a woman
23:34 - in Tech
23:37 - uh should I write a cover letter for my
23:40 - job okay so practical uh you know yeah
23:43 - so so some some of them are practical
23:45 - some are very specific to my experience
23:48 - okay cool well we are going to talk
23:50 - about several of those things that just
23:52 - mention I can just link to this episode
23:54 - yeah mechanical keyboards something that
23:57 - you're interested in uh something that I
24:00 - I happen to have a mechanical keyboard I
24:01 - just use it when I'm on a PC and when um
24:04 - but I I have these little remote Mac
24:06 - ones like this because they're Compact
24:09 - and yeah chick you're like ah Sak
24:14 - blue no like like what is your interest
24:17 - in and how did they come about in
24:19 - mechanical keyboards it really just
24:22 - spiraled where I it started with me just
24:24 - wanting a pretty keyboard where I was
24:26 - just like my desk should be cuter and I
24:28 - always have just like a really boring
24:29 - looking keyboard and then I realized you
24:31 - could customize keyboards and then I
24:34 - just kind of took a nose dive deep into
24:37 - the entire keyboard Community where um
24:40 - there was a point I I lived in New York
24:42 - for several years and then moved to
24:43 - Seattle and I remember one of my
24:46 - co-workers that I was speaking to in New
24:48 - York right before moving he had the
24:50 - coolest keyboard and I just started
24:52 - asking questions like okay you 3D
24:54 - printed that and what switches are these
24:56 - what does this mean and so I just asked
24:57 - him a bunch of questions and then moving
24:59 - to Seattle Seattle is a hobbyist city
25:03 - I've said it before and I will always
25:05 - say this people are so into their
25:06 - hobbies in Seattle where and anything
25:10 - that you could be interested in you will
25:11 - find people interested in that where
25:13 - it's I admit it's kind of hard to make
25:15 - friends outside of of just the hobby but
25:18 - the hobby itself huge and so when I got
25:21 - to Seattle I just went in deep where I
25:23 - ended up being like on the board for
25:25 - nonprofit that taught kids Electronics
25:27 - via soldering mechanical keyboards and
25:29 - reran the Seattle mechanical keyboard
25:32 - Meetup that had like 3 to 400 people
25:34 - bringing their keyboards and that's a
25:36 - lot of people for a keyboard meet up my
25:37 - goodness like it was amazing and and
25:40 - like we had talks on like manufacturing
25:42 - and on stenography and and and so many
25:44 - cool things and and yeah I just kind of
25:46 - got really really deep and then I
25:48 - started designing keycaps because
25:50 - keyboards are expensive and I was just
25:52 - like if I design keycaps maybe I could
25:54 - get some free key caps so I'm not
25:55 - spending too much money that did not
25:58 - help me but hey some some of the key
26:02 - casts behind me I designed those ones I
26:05 - designed those ones I like it it just
26:08 - kind of became a fun thing where I just
26:10 - got really involved with this community
26:12 - that likes making things pretty and
26:15 - functional it's it's reminds me of just
26:17 - like Legos but with more electronics and
26:20 - it's very fun yeah I suppose as a
26:23 - developer you're kind of a crafts person
26:25 - and your tools of the trade your keybo
26:29 - right like that's that's how you kind of
26:30 - interface with the machine is uh and
26:34 - typing keyboards are never going to go
26:35 - out of style because you can type so
26:37 - efficiently and I love typing like
26:39 - whenever I need to think I open up a
26:41 - text editor I just start typing and and
26:43 - that's kind of like I use the pages kind
26:45 - of like an external brain for organizing
26:46 - my ideas I love typing uh what is it
26:50 - about typing and like keyboards that
26:52 - just you think get so many people to
26:54 - care about the kind of tool that they're
26:57 - using because you said it you had 400
26:59 - people in Seattle by the way I'm
27:01 - interested like this is the first time
27:03 - I've ever heard the notion of Seattle is
27:05 - a developer or like I'm sorry like a
27:07 - hobbyist city do you think that has
27:08 - something to do with like all the rain
27:09 - and people staying indoors more yes I
27:11 - 100% that that's exactly what it is I
27:14 - think people are just like well we can't
27:15 - go outside because it's so rainy I guess
27:17 - we're going to get really into this one
27:19 - specific thing I and and there might be
27:22 - some seattleites who disagree but I'm
27:25 - going based on a lot of experience and
27:27 - what I saw
27:28 - um and yeah anyway typing is just it's
27:32 - something that you do it's something fun
27:34 - and also I'm going to shill my startup a
27:36 - little bit to talk about thinking out
27:38 - things but anyway uh
27:40 - yeah when I type on a mechanical
27:43 - keyboard and depending on the different
27:45 - switches all of my keyboards have
27:46 - different switches and different feels
27:48 - and stuff it's it's just kind of fun
27:51 - because it feels different depending on
27:54 - the keyboard that you use and some
27:55 - keyboards make you feel more productive
27:56 - some some are more loud some are more
27:58 - quiet I'm using a quiet one now because
28:00 - whenever I do recordings I have a
28:02 - silenced keyboard because I don't want
28:03 - to be clack clack clack that kind of
28:05 - stuff and so it's it's just kind of fun
28:08 - to have different options and different
28:10 - feels as as you type and and some
28:13 - keyboards I genuinely just type faster
28:14 - on and so I can type at the speed of
28:17 - thought kind of like what you're were
28:18 - saying yeah I when it comes to just like
28:22 - whistling while you work kind of like
28:24 - you're you're going to spend so much
28:26 - time typing like I don't know how do you
28:27 - have any idea like how many key strokes
28:29 - you make on your average day have you
28:30 - ever tried tracking that or anything
28:31 - like that I haven't I should but there's
28:34 - a lot yeah I I imagine you're just
28:37 - constantly typing and like that little
28:39 - tactile feedback it's just like people
28:41 - get really into their cars and like like
28:44 - having the the feel of the car against
28:46 - like exactly how much it slides how it
28:48 - feels when you're accelerating or when
28:50 - you're Switching gears and stuff like I
28:51 - can imagine like developers get the same
28:53 - thing cuz you're kind of doing a lot of
28:55 - those cheaper than a car yeah yeah well
28:57 - how much would like a like a middling
29:00 - mechanical keyboard like a starter
29:02 - mechanical keyboard start you can start
29:04 - relatively cheap I I actually just
29:05 - helped a friend buy one who has never
29:08 - gotten a keyboard before and and I think
29:10 - it was like $40 and and it was it's a
29:12 - nice keyboard like that's going to last
29:14 - for a long time um it they get pricey I
29:18 - I've I've typed on keyboards like at
29:21 - these meetups where it's like oh this is
29:23 - a $3,000 keyboard you type it you're
29:26 - just like oh that's why this is nice but
29:29 - I don't $3,000 keyboard I don't I don't
29:32 - need to go that far but I get it yeah so
29:36 - if money is No Object and you want to
29:37 - have like the best feel then yeah people
29:41 - people spend a lot of money on their
29:43 - Hobbies right I I think that's a
29:44 - reasonable use of of funds uh so let's
29:48 - talk a little bit about uh your startup
29:50 - because you mentioned that you're you
29:52 - know you're CTO and you it's you have uh
29:56 - wall jump many times from company to
29:58 - company over the years and you're like
30:01 - really high up now you're basically it's
30:03 - the Pinnacle as a developer unless you
30:05 - want to go find your own company uh the
30:07 - the pinnac and a lot of Founders are CTO
30:09 - as well maybe you could talk a little
30:10 - bit about that and ideation and and just
30:13 - getting your thoughts down on paper yeah
30:17 - cont contenda is that what it's called
30:19 - contenda yeah but uh we we're in a
30:21 - pivoting stage so we're building an app
30:23 - called brain story and we're uh speaking
30:26 - getting ideas down on paper that's what
30:28 - brain story does so sh'll Break um what
30:32 - we do at uh on brain story is you just
30:35 - talk to your browser about an idea you
30:37 - have and it could be you could be
30:38 - brainstorming like a whole new side
30:40 - project a blog post a conference talk
30:43 - you could just be wanting to talk out
30:44 - while you want to prep for a podcast or
30:46 - a meeting and as you talk it helps guide
30:50 - you uh as you as you speak where I could
30:52 - I could say to brain I'll be just like
30:55 - okay I know I want to build this feature
30:56 - in a side project but I don't know what
30:58 - the UI should look like it just asks me
31:01 - questions like okay well what's the most
31:03 - important thing about this UI and it so
31:06 - it it uses AI but it's not generative AI
31:08 - it just talks back to you and forces you
31:10 - to talk and then as you talk out your
31:12 - ideas Eureka you get answers and so I
31:16 - use it to write and speak and do a lot
31:18 - of things so what you're telling me is
31:20 - I'm spending all this time prompting AI
31:23 - but AI could be prompting me exactly yes
31:27 - and and and yeah and and I think that's
31:29 - the main differentiator and that's why
31:31 - we're we're trying to gear it more
31:32 - towards like students and non-technical
31:35 - people because a lot of developers will
31:37 - be just like well I could just build
31:38 - this with GPT I'm just like kind of but
31:41 - it's once again you're not prompting the
31:43 - computer the computer's prompting you to
31:45 - speak it's it's we call it iterative AI
31:47 - instead of generative AI yeah um but
31:50 - anyway startup things I uh I've been
31:54 - with contenda for a long time for for
31:57 - about three years but I actually started
31:58 - as an adviser for them um and we can get
32:01 - into advisory things in a bit but um my
32:05 - CEO she was a part of my patreon group
32:08 - which I have a patreon where I can help
32:10 - people like with resume reviews and have
32:12 - a Discord group and stuff so just to
32:14 - give people some context like maybe they
32:15 - would subscribe and like pay you you
32:17 - know $1 a month and then if they're at
32:19 - the higher tier maybe they get like a a
32:22 - oneon-one call with you every month or
32:25 - something like that and yeah and so like
32:27 - cheapest one is literally the lowest
32:28 - tier that patreon will give me and it's
32:30 - $2 a month and that just gives you
32:32 - access to the Discord and having that
32:34 - little pay wall is really good for
32:36 - keeping spammers out and so that that's
32:38 - that's that one but then yeah if you do
32:40 - $15 a month I'll review your resume and
32:42 - so we'll all the community to like give
32:44 - you tips and then there's like an
32:46 - interview prep one where like I'll get
32:48 - on one-on-one calls with you for as long
32:49 - as you do it to help interview prep with
32:52 - you um so anyway that's that's what that
32:54 - is and so anyway my CE she was a part of
32:58 - this patreon and she was just playing
33:00 - video games and kind of chilling in the
33:01 - group and she noticed that I was mailing
33:03 - stickers to everybody in the group by
33:05 - hand which took a lot of time and um she
33:09 - said hey if I build something that helps
33:11 - you mail stickers to people would you
33:13 - use it and I said yes cuz I'm getting a
33:15 - hand cramp from writing envelopes um and
33:18 - so she built a tool that we now call
33:21 - contenna which which mailed stickers to
33:24 - people and it did so well it actually
33:27 - helped lewig on Twitch break the world
33:28 - record for the most number of
33:30 - subscribers um which was cool but
33:32 - stickers don't really like Venture scale
33:35 - and so it she I I was an adviser at that
33:39 - point trying to like give tips as she
33:41 - was kind of working on this and then uh
33:43 - she had founding Engineers to help out
33:45 - and they ended up building tools for
33:46 - like helping you retain subscribers as a
33:49 - Creator and then eventually before the
33:51 - gpts came out it was transforming
33:53 - content where you could say like turn
33:55 - this podcast into a Blog post or turn
33:57 - these videos into tweets or something um
34:00 - and then the gpts came out
34:02 - and all of a sudden everybody knew about
34:04 - Ai and so there's so many pivots in
34:06 - there to try to be just like here's how
34:08 - we're different here's how you could do
34:10 - this but um because Chad gbt and all
34:12 - these tools came out the differentiating
34:15 - factors were getting Slimmer and Slimmer
34:17 - and so we were pivoting more and more
34:19 - again um and we had a developer API and
34:22 - in this time I joined as CTO um and so I
34:25 - I've been I've been full time as CTO for
34:28 - over a year now year and a
34:31 - halfish time isn't real but
34:33 - anyway not after the pandemic yeah
34:37 - seriously though it's it's wild um but
34:39 - anyway we had a developer API with our
34:42 - previous product and we thought oh let's
34:44 - build just like mini apps on top of our
34:46 - Dev API and see what could work and we
34:49 - had built this tool that we designed to
34:51 - help high school students write college
34:53 - essays um where it wouldn't write the
34:55 - essay for them but they could could just
34:57 - talk out like essay questions um and
35:00 - figure out like how they might want to
35:02 - frame their essay and it worked so well
35:04 - we were like wait a minute this could
35:05 - apply to others too and so we we thus
35:08 - brain story was born and it's just helps
35:11 - you talk out your ideas for anything and
35:14 - people have used it to plan D and D
35:16 - campaigns some people use it to like
35:18 - write literal like standup comedy sets
35:21 - um there's a big like contingent of like
35:23 - sports psychology like improving your
35:25 - mindset around certain by just talking
35:27 - it out performance Coes yeah yeah ex
35:30 - which is really just therapy but it's
35:32 - like therapy for professionals yeah
35:35 - exactly uh honestly there there was one
35:37 - user that where we were doing like a
35:39 - user test and she said I think this
35:40 - knows me better than my therapist we're
35:42 - like no this isn't a therapist we don't
35:44 - want that legal burden but uh that's
35:46 - what brain story is and and it's been
35:48 - really fun to work on very cool it is
35:50 - cool like you know just to give context
35:53 - if anyone hasn't heard the term pivot
35:54 - like a lot of times startups early on
35:56 - they everybody's trying to get traction
35:58 - right they trying to get a whole lot of
36:01 - people to you know essentially like use
36:04 - their product or you know better yet
36:05 - give them money so that they can go and
36:08 - they can get more funding and they can
36:09 - expand and you know do all these things
36:11 - that that startups do and uh so a pivot
36:14 - is just generally where you completely
36:16 - change your product or maybe it could be
36:18 - a smaller pivot like instead of doing
36:21 - like something in the same space you you
36:23 - your solution is slightly different you
36:25 - take a different approach AI caus a lot
36:27 - of companies to Pivot over the past few
36:29 - years uh and uh you know it also costs
36:33 - companies like Che that like you know
36:36 - would help people with their uh their
36:40 - homework and stuff uh you don't need to
36:43 - pay for you know answers to test
36:46 - questions and stuff like that so you can
36:47 - cheat on your test if you got like
36:49 - something like uh a foundational llm
36:52 - that can like help you just answer all
36:54 - the questions real quick and like teach
36:55 - you that stuff right so
36:57 - um yeah it's been quite tumultuous uh
36:59 - but I'm glad to hear that you all have
37:01 - been able to actually not only pay it
37:03 - but also incorporate some similar
37:06 - approaches even if you're not using like
37:07 - an llm per se uh I'm not sure do you do
37:10 - you all use llms at all yeah we we do
37:12 - some under the hood we we've done so
37:15 - many things custom where we're like now
37:17 - we're just like dang GPT makes this easy
37:19 - and so there we we uh do have some gupt
37:22 - stuff under the hood but a lot of it
37:24 - we've we've built in housee yeah and
37:26 - just to be like I have a policy like on
37:28 - the podcast I always explain acronyms
37:30 - even though I've said it probably a many
37:31 - times llm large language model uh gp4
37:35 - being uh probably the most popular large
37:37 - language model so um and spoiler alert
37:41 - we we do have an interview with uh the
37:44 - first developer Advocate uh at open aai
37:48 - uh and she and I are neighbors we were
37:50 - just talking recently we're like so we
37:52 - live less than 10 minutes apart Chicago
37:55 - Connection wow Patrick being the person
37:57 - we're talking about yeah
37:59 - um you've lived in so many cities I know
38:01 - this is like a really bad transition
38:03 - you've lived in so many cities like so
38:05 - you grew up in Chicago then you moved uh
38:08 - to Ohio to go to Ohio say Iowa I always
38:12 - get those four letter O names mixed up
38:14 - Iowa State uh and then while you were
38:17 - there you of course got your CS degree
38:18 - and you've lived in like where what are
38:20 - other major cities of a bunch of cities
38:23 - yeah so so I've lived I yeah moved to
38:27 - Iowa for school and then for my
38:29 - internships I lived in Minneapolis
38:30 - Seattle and then the San Francisco Bay
38:32 - Area um I also lived in Spain for a good
38:35 - chunk of time for studying abroad and
38:38 - loved it that was amazing everybody
38:39 - should study abroad if they have the
38:40 - opportunity it's it's so great and I've
38:42 - gone back to Spain so many times since
38:44 - like it it I've maintained friendships
38:46 - there H it was the best um and then I
38:50 - lived in New York City after graduation
38:52 - for three years three or four years you
38:55 - lived in like every major city except
38:56 - for Dallas pretty much and then and then
38:58 - I lived in I lived in Seattle after that
39:00 - and then in the pandemic moved back to
39:02 - Chicago yeah wow so you you've like hit
39:06 - basically every major city and one of
39:08 - the things that is that really intrigues
39:10 - me about your career this past decade
39:13 - plus that you've been working in Tech is
39:15 - that you've changed jobs a lot and
39:19 - there's conventional wisdom that like oh
39:21 - you get a job and you keep it for at
39:23 - least two years you don't have gaps you
39:25 - don't have uh you know you don't want to
39:27 - have to explain your your job changes to
39:30 - uh some HR person because it's an
39:32 - awkward conversation but um you know did
39:35 - they quietly push you out and then you
39:37 - just resigned and made it look like you
39:39 - Chang jobs or like there's always that
39:40 - suspicion like looming over like why
39:42 - this person keeps changing jobs are they
39:43 - just not a good fit or are they overly
39:46 - careerist and they're just trying to
39:48 - ascend the ladder as quickly as possible
39:50 - like why have you changed job so much
39:54 - and like and what do you think are the
39:57 - stigmas around that and do you think
39:58 - they're warranted yeah yeah I think
40:01 - there are stigmas around it and and for
40:03 - some of them yes like I will say if you
40:06 - see a bunch of people work I I've talked
40:08 - to people I'm just like all of your jobs
40:10 - have been like two months or less that's
40:13 - very short I I try to I try to stay a
40:16 - little bit longer at places and I never
40:18 - go into a job thinking like I'm going to
40:20 - be out of here in a year I I always try
40:22 - to to stay as long as possible but just
40:24 - life happens and I think just as an
40:27 - aside it's really good to do like life
40:30 - audits to be like are you going in the
40:32 - direction where you want to be going um
40:34 - and is your job stopping you from doing
40:36 - that um and so after college I went to
40:38 - venmo and I was a Dev Advocate there it
40:41 - was really fun I I was working on the
40:43 - product itself um I built blocking so if
40:45 - you ever block someone but no that was
40:47 - me um cool and then uh also how does
40:50 - that work you block people they can't
40:51 - send you money anymore or do people send
40:53 - you money like is there a messaging
40:55 - client or something
40:57 - well people would like be annoying
41:00 - people or harassing people by just
41:01 - sending one cent at a time with like
41:03 - annoying payment messages ah people
41:07 - people be annoying but anyway um so
41:10 - loved being at venmo it was a really
41:12 - really cool place to work they were
41:14 - bought out and um them right yeahp right
41:19 - yeah PayPal bought them and and this was
41:21 - before eBay and PayPal split and stuff
41:23 - and and they were actually bought by a
41:25 - company named Brain tree and PayPal
41:27 - bought them we jokingly called it ventry
41:30 - palb because it was venmo brain tree
41:31 - PayPal eBay and then like PayPal and
41:34 - eBay split while I was there chaotic
41:36 - time so a lot of chaos that was
41:38 - completely out of your control and and
41:40 - you just want to like work on product
41:42 - and yeah there's probably all kinds of
41:43 - org changes and like they ended up
41:46 - discontinuing the API and as a Dev
41:48 - Advocate what are you supposed to do if
41:50 - the API is going away like that kind of
41:53 - stuff and so I ended up leaving because
41:55 - like I was talking to fellow co-workers
41:58 - on like the brain tree and PayPal side
41:59 - and they're just like they're not going
42:00 - to be supporting you much longer if you
42:03 - have an opportunity you should probably
42:06 - get out of Dodge and so that's why I
42:07 - ended up leaving um yeah and and I'm so
42:09 - grateful to them they were they were
42:10 - really kind people who I still keep in
42:12 - touch with who were like looking out for
42:14 - me in that regard and um so anyway yeah
42:17 - I left that's not the only time your
42:18 - company that you've been working at has
42:20 - been acquired right like is that
42:22 - happened another time that's yeah so
42:24 - that that's happened that happened again
42:25 - so after venmo I went to a company
42:27 - called clarify they're an AI startup um
42:30 - I think they're series C now they do
42:32 - cool like image recognition things I I
42:34 - loved working there too I actually
42:36 - worked with my sister there for a little
42:37 - bit of time before she went off to
42:39 - Google and um I moved and remote work
42:43 - wasn't as much of a thing then and so I
42:45 - was moving from New York to Seattle and
42:47 - that is what caused me to do that job
42:49 - change where just personal life things
42:52 - and so after that I went to a company
42:53 - called L4 L4 digital which was a
42:56 - creative Agency on Seattle Super loved
42:59 - that too it was also bought
43:01 - out and so that that one was bought out
43:04 - by a a large company based in Argentina
43:07 - called glent and um it was it was cool
43:10 - kind of being involved with them but uh
43:12 - they were very quickly changing a lot of
43:15 - the company culture and everything and
43:18 - and uh it it just it just wasn't the
43:21 - kind of environment that I was really
43:23 - wanting to stick a part of but I but I
43:24 - really enjoyed that job cuz I was an
43:26 - engineering manager there as well as
43:27 - just engineering on a bunch of cool
43:29 - client projects um but yeah eventually I
43:32 - was just like the I think I was there a
43:35 - little more than a year and a half but
43:37 - the large company changes were uh kind
43:41 - of messing with the the culture enough
43:43 - that I decided to go and then I went to
43:45 - Amazon which was a bad choice um for me
43:49 - I'm sure there are people who love their
43:50 - jobs at Amazon and are there for a long
43:52 - time but I knew like two weeks in that
43:55 - they pay very well but at what cost and
43:58 - it was like truly a golden handcuff
43:59 - situation and so I tried to stick it out
44:02 - but there came a point where I was just
44:04 - like the money is not worth it I'm
44:06 - really unhappy here um and so I quit
44:09 - after about seven months at Amazon and
44:11 - then went to Coden which was awesome
44:13 - yeah codepen amazing tool C is such a
44:16 - great tool yeah and I I still talk to
44:19 - those people to this day like literally
44:21 - yesterday um they're they're such a
44:23 - great team and I really loved working on
44:24 - codepen um building out features and
44:27 - stuff and it was just a straight up
44:29 - software engineering role not Dev
44:30 - advocacy or anything but as a result I
44:32 - was kind of missing the dev advocacy
44:34 - stuff um and so I would like still
44:37 - occasionally speak at conferences and
44:39 - and uh do more developer facing things
44:41 - and that was where I started doing the
44:43 - Tik Tock and and just started kind of
44:46 - doing more public things while also
44:47 - working on the product um but they
44:50 - needed they needed someone who's just
44:52 - software engineering who who wasn't
44:53 - doing the dev advocacy stuff and and uh
44:56 - are doing like the public speaking
44:58 - things and we we kind of tried to see if
45:00 - there was a balance there and and
45:02 - honestly there just wasn't there were
45:04 - just like we're so sorry but we can't
45:05 - really support like you going to
45:07 - conferences and stuff we need you to be
45:09 - engineering and um so we parted ways I I
45:13 - I was just like I love you guys but I'm
45:15 - going to go do something for developers
45:17 - because I really like the teaching
45:19 - aspect um and uh yeah the that one was a
45:23 - shame because I I really loved working
45:25 - at codepen I just wanted to be working
45:27 - with developers more and um so then I
45:30 - went and became a full-time teacher and
45:32 - so I I was teaching at a company called
45:34 - react training full-time and it was
45:37 - great I was I was traveling a ton and
45:39 - just giving workshops on how to write
45:41 - react better all the time um that is
45:44 - where I started live streaming a bit
45:45 - more on on the react side too it was
45:47 - great um and then the pandemic happened
45:51 - and uh at that I guess that puts a Kash
45:53 - on like a lot of the activity that you
45:55 - would have
45:56 - as a teacher if you're doing like
45:57 - inperson workshops and stuff it did yeah
45:59 - I was I was doing so much iners stuff
46:02 - that like I called 2020 in January I was
46:05 - like this is going to be my year of
46:06 - travel I'm going to do like a last Terra
46:08 - and then I'll stop and so like I went to
46:11 - Austria I went to Boston I went to SF I
46:13 - went to France I went to Ireland I I
46:15 - went to Hawaii I was traveling a ton
46:17 - just in January and February and then in
46:19 - early March I was coming back from
46:21 - Dublin I was going to be home for three
46:22 - days then go to Spain and then shut down
46:26 - and everything started shutting down
46:29 - and digital workshops weren't just
46:31 - simply weren't as much of a thing at
46:34 - that point people probably were less
46:35 - inclined to pay a lot of money companies
46:38 - were probably less inclined to send
46:40 - their employees to something that is
46:42 - just a virtual webinar type thing and so
46:44 - like within two weeks react training had
46:47 - to shut down cuz we just W two weeks
46:49 - well at least I mean kudos to them for
46:51 - rep recognizing the writing on the wall
46:54 - that this was going to be a big thing
46:56 - the biggest thing that's happened in our
46:58 - lifetime probably hopefully the biggest
46:59 - thing that will happen in our lifetime
47:01 - yeah it was it was wild and and it was
47:04 - such a shame too cuz we said at the
47:05 - beginning of March we're like we have so
47:07 - many workshops in March we just have to
47:08 - get through March and then we'll have
47:09 - runway for like two or three years and
47:12 - we couldn't get through March so um
47:14 - anyway that that that is what led me to
47:17 - leave react training because the company
47:19 - shut down and uh then I went to NFI
47:21 - after that and nlii was great I I was
47:24 - doing Dev advocacy on act in xjs there
47:27 - and had a blast and and I did that for
47:29 - for a while um and then after like
47:33 - almost two years I was just starting to
47:35 - burn out a ton because I moved up into
47:38 - management as like a director of Dev
47:40 - experience there and uh it was just it
47:42 - was so much work um but it was like a
47:45 - combination of doing the director work
47:47 - and the individual contributor work um
47:49 - where I was still like coding writing
47:52 - blog posts doing all these things but I
47:53 - was also in meetings like
47:56 - so so many meetings like 11 to 15
47:58 - meetings a day it was like like 10
48:02 - minute meetings or like how are you
48:03 - doing no they were not I I like it was
48:06 - it was too much and and the it was the
48:09 - kind of thing where I really loved the
48:11 - product and working on it I just
48:13 - physically couldn't handle it anymore um
48:15 - and so I ended up I ended up leaving
48:18 - because I I was just burning out but I'm
48:20 - to this day I'm still an adviser for
48:21 - them where like I still talk with them
48:23 - regularly and stuff and have a great
48:24 - relationship with them because I do like
48:26 - the product and what they're doing I
48:27 - just was so tired yeah they're they're a
48:30 - cool company and you know I as I always
48:33 - like to tell the tale of me being in
48:35 - hackathons with Matt bman the founder uh
48:39 - and they've been a supporter of Freo
48:40 - Camp early on uh as well and we we have
48:43 - used their tools over the years um so
48:46 - many things to talk about so many things
48:48 - and I I still have two more jobs to go
48:50 - okay go ahead let's continue yeah and so
48:53 - after that I I considered starting my
48:55 - own thing and like took a little break
48:57 - cuz I was like maybe I will maybe I will
48:59 - then I didn't and I ended up going to
49:01 - remote remote.com to uh I was ahead of
49:04 - developer education there and I was
49:06 - going to see like okay what what
49:08 - resources can I provide for remote
49:10 - developers remote grew so fast where
49:14 - when I first started talking with them
49:16 - in like early pandemic days just like
49:17 - friendly they were at like 25 people
49:20 - then when I interviewed it was more like
49:22 - 200 people wow which was quite a big
49:24 - jump but
49:26 - I joined they were at a thousand people
49:29 - they exploded in growth you can't gr
49:32 - that quickly without making a lot of bad
49:34 - hires in my opinion like I just don't I
49:36 - don't believe for a second that an
49:38 - organization can grow that quickly
49:39 - without cracks forming I it was yeah and
49:42 - unfortunately I think I kind of was
49:43 - falling through some of those cracks
49:44 - where like everybody was so kind and and
49:48 - there's such lovely people there which
49:49 - once again still stay in touch with them
49:51 - um but it just grew so fast and and
49:56 - I would be working on something like I I
49:58 - ran like the devs for Ukraine conference
50:00 - to uh help support developers there and
50:02 - people there to raise money and I I was
50:04 - able to do some cool initiatives but so
50:07 - many things I was just like hey this is
50:09 - like the plan for this and people would
50:11 - say Cassidy that's awesome we don't have
50:13 - time for that because it was growing so
50:15 - much um and so anyway I really liked it
50:19 - there but it just it was so much um and
50:23 - then this is where like the personal
50:24 - things came into play I got pregnant and
50:28 - I was just like is this the kind of role
50:30 - that I want to continue doing while I'm
50:33 - pregnant and will I have the flexibility
50:35 - to like be able to take care of my kid
50:37 - and stuff and um that's when I started
50:40 - talking more with contendo where I've
50:42 - been I had been an adviser for them for
50:45 - a year a year and a half for them at
50:47 - that point and um they had been talking
50:50 - to me about how they wanted to find a
50:51 - CTO to fill in some gaps and so as I was
50:55 - talking with them I was like so what if
50:57 - I was that CTO and and uh we kind of
51:00 - talked as a whole team and it just kind
51:02 - of was a very natural fit where I knew
51:04 - everybody really well I had met with
51:06 - them in person a bunch of times and and
51:09 - we we were like friends in addition to
51:11 - colleagues and stuff and yeah it just
51:14 - seemed like the right fit and I've been
51:16 - with them ever since awesome so many
51:18 - different stops your journey uh
51:21 - and uh I'm going to link to your
51:24 - LinkedIn in case anybody wants to to
51:26 - follow you there or like read through I
51:28 - was in I was like you know she's she's
51:31 - younger than I am uh I don't know I'm
51:32 - not going to ask your age but you're
51:34 - like way younger than me and yet youve
51:35 - worked at like 10 times as many places
51:38 - as I am I think it's it's wild like I
51:40 - think there were like 20 plus entries on
51:42 - your like experience so many of it is
51:45 - like advisory roles and like parttime
51:46 - things too but yeah I and it like when I
51:50 - go into the story like that companies
51:52 - never question why I have such a big
51:54 - resume they're just like oh well of of
51:55 - course oh yeah that makes sense like
51:56 - it's it's never me just saying I wanted
51:58 - more money so I left it's it's usually
52:01 - you have good reasons for every single
52:02 - thing and one of the two of the reasons
52:04 - that I do want to drill deeper into one
52:08 - is you know the notion of culture which
52:10 - a lot of people uh who are privileged
52:13 - just like culture doesn't even exist
52:15 - what is that it's like nonsense you know
52:16 - Corp culture always exists yeah what are
52:20 - what you would call cultural indicators
52:22 - uh and and maybe we can back up and we
52:24 - can talk about if you don't mind me just
52:27 - saying your experience in Tech as a
52:30 - woman because women uh I don't like it
52:34 - but women are a minority in Tech I think
52:38 - they depending on like maybe maybe you
52:41 - have like a good estimate of the number
52:43 - of women in Tech or the proportion of
52:45 - women in last stat I saw was 133% 133%
52:49 - yeah and there was like a stack Overflow
52:50 - survey a few years ago where like 6% of
52:53 - the respondents were women or something
52:55 - like that that it was like really low um
52:57 - and of course like I can tell you like
52:59 - fre Co Camp we're very proud that about
53:00 - a third of the people learning on free
53:03 - Camp are women that's not 50% but right
53:06 - but still that's good proportionally
53:08 - compared to a lot of the industry and
53:10 - it's going to be a multigenerational
53:12 - effort to get more women into Tech uh in
53:14 - my humble opinion uh there are lots of
53:17 - cultural things and a lot of economic
53:18 - reasons and a lot of just like systemic
53:22 - you know bias reasons uh but maybe you
53:24 - could talk a little bit about your own
53:26 - kind of like entree into Tech and the
53:28 - first time that you felt like wow I I
53:31 - didn't realize there were so few women
53:32 - in Tech yeah I found out early on that
53:37 - there were not many women in Tech
53:39 - because I took AP Computer Science in
53:40 - high school where I first started coding
53:43 - before that where I was just like oh
53:45 - wait you can make websites and I was
53:47 - really excited to play around with with
53:50 - HTML CSS JavaScript and just kind of was
53:52 - figuring things out and was having a
53:54 - blast doing it and then when I realized
53:56 - that my school was offering AP Computer
53:58 - Science I was like oh I'm going to take
54:00 - that and and it'll be great and
54:02 - literally the first thing that the
54:04 - teacher said in the class on the first
54:06 - day was as you can see we have a girl
54:08 - this year I was like oh and uh yeah that
54:13 - that that was a very rude awakening
54:15 - where it just the that was the theme for
54:18 - a lot of girl this year that's wild yeah
54:23 - that that was my first like group inter
54:25 - action um but that is how I found NC wit
54:30 - which I mentioned earlier where where
54:31 - like and what what is National Center
54:34 - for Women in it I'm going to link to
54:35 - that yeah they're awesome they they have
54:38 - uh awards for high school girls every
54:40 - year and then they also have a
54:42 - Collegiate organization they they're
54:45 - they're a research organization so they
54:46 - put together really good uh research um
54:50 - and informationals that companies can
54:52 - use and stuff they're they're a really
54:53 - great orc but any anyway I first got
54:57 - involved with them because in that class
54:59 - when I would like finish an exercise and
55:01 - had time I would just start like looking
55:03 - up like how do how do I find other girls
55:07 - because I just didn't know where they
55:09 - were um and yeah so that that's how I
55:12 - first got involved with NY wit um
55:14 - because I was looking for a community
55:16 - where I didn't have one yet so you were
55:19 - not content to just accept that like
55:21 - okay everybody I interact with is going
55:23 - to be a dude you very early tried to
55:26 - like build connections with other women
55:28 - at Tech yeah and like I'm okay with I'm
55:32 - okay with hanging out dudes and I kind
55:34 - of have to be because because of the
55:36 - nature of tech and and so many of my
55:39 - college courses there would be like one
55:41 - or two of us or or something just funny
55:44 - story recently I was I was just walking
55:45 - around in Chicago and I saw one of the
55:47 - girls where she was like the other one
55:49 - in my course and we looked at each other
55:51 - like you live in Chicago hi and like we
55:54 - just hadn't seen each each other since
55:56 - college and it was cool to be just where
55:58 - like we were introducing our husbands
56:00 - and we were just like she was the other
56:02 - one we this is great um the bond it's
56:06 - it's forever but uh
56:09 - anyway it it was something where like I
56:12 - knew there had to be something out there
56:14 - and then luckily there was and it's
56:16 - something where in general I think you
56:18 - should have a community no matter the
56:21 - industry to stay in it where people have
56:24 - your back um where like whe whether
56:27 - whether it's a diverse one or not it
56:29 - should be a diverse one but you know
56:30 - like it it's having a community that can
56:34 - check on you and be just like hey how
56:35 - did this thing go I know you were
56:36 - worried about it or hey good luck on
56:39 - your job interview this day or or let's
56:42 - talk through this problem you're having
56:43 - or something Have having that kind of
56:45 - community is so so valuable and I think
56:48 - is particularly pretty hard again in
56:50 - this post-pandemic world but again
56:52 - that's why I have like my patreon
56:54 - Discord group we have we are such a
56:57 - great Community where it's just us
56:58 - talking about this is this is what I'm
57:00 - trying to learn right now and uh there's
57:02 - there's so many good ones associated
57:04 - with free code camp and on Twitter and
57:06 - and various places have having those
57:08 - communities is so important and that's
57:11 - that's been something that has been so
57:13 - helpful to me throughout my career yeah
57:16 - and so you've talked a little bit in the
57:18 - past about like kind of cultural
57:20 - indicators that you look for to
57:21 - companies you even tweeted a few days
57:23 - ago I think I was scrolling through your
57:25 - Twitter earlier that you think that
57:27 - companies should offer three different
57:29 - things and if they don't offer at least
57:31 - two of those three things you shouldn't
57:32 - consider them as like a serious
57:35 - opportunity uh maybe do you recall what
57:38 - those three things were yeah and so that
57:40 - that's while you're at the company or
57:42 - while you're interviewing they should
57:43 - have good pay good culture and good
57:45 - growth opportunities yeah two out of
57:48 - three is pretty good all three would be
57:50 - great um but if if you're at a company
57:53 - and you realize oh I only have one out
57:55 - of three or something or or I don't have
57:57 - any of these or or something you might
57:59 - want to question why you're there that
58:01 - doesn't necessarily mean jump ship
58:03 - because having a job is good but yeah if
58:07 - you if you don't question those kinds of
58:09 - things then you will be stuck in a
58:11 - situation that's not serving you well
58:14 - yeah well I would argue that like just
58:16 - from looking at the job application you
58:18 - can probably figure out the compensation
58:20 - if they publicly list that and you you
58:22 - might even be able to surmise like
58:24 - software engineer 2 probably leads to
58:26 - software engineer 3 probably leads to
58:28 - like Engineering Management you know
58:30 - role uh so like assuming it's like a big
58:34 - tech company and that people do
58:35 - gradually rise up the ranks
58:39 - um that is that's basically two of them
58:41 - that you can kind of surmise just from
58:43 - doing a little bit of research but
58:45 - culture is a little bit trickier and how
58:48 - would you establish whether a company
58:50 - has a you know a healthy culture that's
58:53 - like conducive to being able to work and
58:55 - be sane and stuff like that how would
58:57 - you figure that out if you were on the
58:59 - outside and you were looking at a
59:00 - company and considering applying what
59:02 - what are the uh kind of the telltale
59:04 - signs of like potentially toxic culture
59:08 - yeah well so first of all one that I've
59:11 - seen and where I've actually like gone
59:13 - in the other direction is where they say
59:14 - oh we don't really have a culture
59:16 - yet all companies have a culture like if
59:20 - you say that there is no culture that
59:22 - means that there might not be a great
59:23 - culture like like all companies have
59:25 - have some element of culture there um
59:27 - but then I also I'm very curious to sus
59:30 - out how people communicate across an orc
59:33 - um and so I typically one question that
59:35 - I actually ask in job interviews is
59:38 - what's the most important thing the
59:40 - customer the product or the employees
59:42 - and none of those answers are wrong like
59:45 - those are all actually like they're
59:46 - they're all three important but if you
59:48 - were to pick one what what is the most
59:49 - important customer product or employees
59:52 - um and what's interesting about the
59:54 - answers is how people answer them and if
59:57 - that answer is consistent across
59:58 - interviewers where like when I
60:01 - interviewed at Amazon every single
60:03 - person said the customer like it was a
60:05 - very very clear customer Obsession right
60:07 - I customer Obsession that's what they're
60:08 - all about yeah and and so you know that
60:12 - they communicate well on that front and
60:14 - granted the culture wasn't that great
60:15 - when I was at Amazon but it it it was a
60:18 - good indicator of how people
60:19 - communicated and when people answer that
60:22 - question differently then it's
60:24 - interesting to see okay why do you why
60:26 - do they answer it differently how did
60:27 - their answers differ um when they
60:29 - explain it because sometimes the the way
60:31 - they explain it you're just like oh it
60:33 - makes sense why this person would answer
60:34 - this way and this person would answer
60:35 - this way but um again none of those
60:38 - answers are wrong but it's useful to see
60:40 - we're like when I internet into it I
60:42 - I've been doing this for a lot many
60:43 - years now internet into it everybody
60:45 - said oh the employees are number one and
60:48 - and here's why I think it and and it's
60:51 - it's cool to see how people communicate
60:54 - about what their environment is and then
60:57 - one last one that uh that I like to ask
60:59 - is just if you had a magic wand and
61:01 - could change anything about the company
61:03 - what would you change um and seeing
61:05 - people do that where like like it's not
61:08 - necessarily a bad thing but what what is
61:09 - the magic wand that that thing that you
61:11 - would change people's answers there are
61:15 - very good ways to sus out how things are
61:18 - where sometimes people are just like I
61:20 - would get rid of this group in the
61:23 - company where where it's just like I I
61:24 - don't want we have too many product
61:27 - managers or something um sometimes the
61:30 - answer has been I don't like that we're
61:32 - under the fist of capitalism I would
61:33 - probably wish away our VCS or something
61:36 - like that and and you can kind of see
61:38 - what is the thing that drives uh culture
61:42 - or NE anything negative or or something
61:44 - at the company and so anyway those are
61:46 - the questions I answer and it's been
61:47 - pretty helpful for those are great
61:49 - questions um especially like what would
61:51 - you wish away man
61:55 - like when you as that I was like what
61:56 - would I
61:58 - well we're not interviewing me here but
62:01 - one thing I would wish away is the
62:02 - complexity of the US immigration system
62:06 - I would I would love to be able to say
62:07 - to everybody who works at freeo Camp
62:09 - we're going to get you and H1B visa and
62:11 - if you want you can come and live here
62:12 - in the US um so that unfortunately
62:15 - that's yeah I mean you you probably I
62:18 - don't know how much of the immigration
62:20 - system you've had to go through with
62:21 - your husband but it was it's been it's
62:24 - been
62:25 - yeah yeah it's quite complicated to uh
62:28 - to get even like so we have a team
62:31 - member here in the US and sorry I'm not
62:34 - going to like bash the us but I will
62:36 - bash the US immigration system that is
62:37 - one thing that I've I think that's fair
62:39 - it's within my right as a US taxpayer as
62:42 - somebody who works to you know make this
62:44 - country better that I can complain about
62:47 - the immigration system so uh we have a
62:50 - team member who is working she's also
62:52 - working at Salesforce uh she's working
62:53 - parttime at free Co Camp developing some
62:55 - courses and she you know studied in the
62:58 - US she's worked as a software engineer
63:01 - at Salesforce for like four years um
63:05 - actually it may not be four years but
63:06 - she's the four years that she's been
63:08 - here in the US she's applied to the H1B
63:13 - Lottery and she every single time she
63:15 - has not gotten it and this is absolutely
63:17 - the kind of like well-educated like
63:20 - highly compensated like expert that the
63:23 - US
63:26 - yeah and she's going to have to move to
63:27 - Canada if she doesn't win this time like
63:29 - there's like a limit in the number of
63:30 - times and Salesforce actually has like
63:32 - an entire like plan in place for uh
63:35 - employees who can't get an H1B Visa
63:37 - through the lottery uh despite spending
63:39 - you know tens of thousands of dollars
63:41 - and everything to try to get help them
63:42 - get that they have to move up to
63:44 - Vancouver from the San Francisco Bay
63:46 - area and they have to continue working
63:48 - from the Vancouver you know satellite so
63:50 - it's just one of those things it's like
63:51 - why does America shoot itself in the
63:53 - foot with this terrible immigration
63:55 - system but anyway I'm sorry I'll stop
63:57 - venting but but that is my magic that
63:59 - would be a great magic wand I would like
64:01 - to borrow that one that's one of the few
64:03 - things that like me as like a founder
64:05 - and like executive director which is
64:07 - basically the charity equivalent of a of
64:10 - a CEO like that's one thing that I feel
64:12 - completely powerless over uh I can
64:14 - change so much and like like we we work
64:17 - very hard to attract lots of women to
64:19 - work at free C Camp and and as I may
64:21 - have said earlier we're like nearly half
64:23 - women on our team both engineering and
64:26 - instructional and you know we're proud
64:29 - of that and yeah it takes a concertive
64:33 - effort to not only uh encourage women to
64:37 - join your team but to retain them over
64:40 - time because yeah uh it sounds like some
64:43 - of your cultural experiences I mean like
64:47 - when you look at culture like how much
64:49 - of it has come down to like they they do
64:51 - they have systematic bias against women
64:54 - at some of these organizations you
64:56 - worked at I don't want you to have to
64:57 - like Lobby
64:58 - specific lob specific accusations or
65:00 - anything but I left Amazon for a reason
65:05 - like and and luckily like with with some
65:08 - of the organizations sorry there's a big
65:10 - siren coming out outside so no worries
65:13 - we're in Chicago after all and it's a
65:15 - big city like a do you live in the BBS
65:17 - or I live in Chicago proper yeah oh wow
65:20 - yeah it's and it's great I just happen
65:22 - to live somewhat near a fire St so
65:25 - that's why we have some Sirens but
65:27 - anyway um luckily I think in a lot of my
65:31 - jobs it hasn't been too bad relatively
65:34 - speaking like like
65:36 - I I have no room to complain because
65:40 - people close to me have gone through so
65:42 - much worse that being said it exists
65:45 - there there's there's definitely
65:47 - systemic biases and very unkind people
65:52 - in the world who who let those biases
65:53 - the affect their decisions and and the
65:55 - words they say and the things that they
65:56 - do um and yeah when when I I'll just a a
66:02 - brief vignette when I was at Amazon like
66:05 - there was a point where I was for
66:07 - example supposed to run an event for a
66:09 - bunch of uh customers who were building
66:11 - on top of the echo devices I'm not
66:13 - saying her name because she's back there
66:14 - and she'll talk back okay um but anyway
66:17 - I was I was running inent it was a big
66:19 - deal like I was literally reporting
66:21 - certain findings to the s team which is
66:23 - the people who reports Jeff Bezos like
66:25 - it it was a big event and people weren't
66:27 - responding to my emails and I was like
66:29 - you need to submit your talks to me so I
66:30 - can put together this and and like make
66:33 - sure that these technical areas are
66:35 - covered and stuff people just wouldn't
66:37 - respond to me and I remember talking to
66:40 - my manager saying like hey do I need to
66:42 - build some clout here or something to so
66:44 - that way people respond he said oh it's
66:46 - cuz you're a woman we have a problem
66:47 - with that here like cool great well at
66:50 - least he acknowledge that it's a known
66:52 - issue but yeah do something about it
66:54 - what the heck so and like he he replied
66:56 - all to my group email to all of these
66:58 - people saying Hey give Cassidy the info
67:01 - they would say okay hey Dave here's the
67:02 - stuff like within an hour after me him
67:05 - they wouldn't add addressing him not me
67:07 - and like there were that that's like a
67:10 - very brief small minor thing but there
67:13 - was so much more that happened beyond
67:15 - that that like it it just it was
67:17 - miserable and and unfortunately like
67:21 - that was nothing compared to what some
67:22 - of the women on my team were going
67:24 - through there or my own sister was going
67:26 - through there yeah let's talk about your
67:27 - sister a little bit too she's somebody
67:29 - we I mean you've mentioned her a couple
67:31 - times but she followed very closely in
67:33 - your footsteps it sounds like or as you
67:35 - said before we met she followed in her
67:36 - own footsteps tell us a little bit about
67:38 - your sister footsteps yeah yeah and so
67:41 - my sister and I were were pretty close
67:43 - in age and we both majored in computer
67:44 - science that Iowa State um and uh we've
67:48 - worked together multiple times and then
67:51 - all and really diverged because we both
67:53 - like very different environments where
67:56 - um she and I both worked at clarify the
67:58 - startup and then we also both worked at
67:59 - Amazon together and uh I love startups
68:03 - she loves big companies so she she's
68:06 - kind of collected like The Infinity
68:08 - Gauntlet of big companies where she's
68:09 - worked at Apple Microsoft Google Amazon
68:12 - and now meta got to catch them all wow
68:14 - that's that's impressive like the entire
68:17 - Fang basically she's literally all the
68:19 - like she doesn't have Netflix but once
68:20 - she does she's done she she's made it
68:23 - but but yeah so she she must get a lot
68:26 - of recruiters reaching out to her my
68:28 - goodness I can only imagine and I hope I
68:30 - would like to think that her recruit
68:32 - like in recruiting like one of the big
68:35 - things the signal is where they already
68:36 - work because if they're good enough to
68:37 - work there there's a good chance they're
68:39 - good enough to work here like I can
68:41 - imagine she has a very easy time getting
68:43 - jobs if she does have a hard time
68:45 - getting jobs she's also just really good
68:47 - at what she does yeah and so and and
68:49 - it's fun cuz she and I work together
68:51 - really well like it's it's really fun to
68:53 - do things with her like when we were
68:55 - both at clarify we would sometimes give
68:57 - talks together um which was a blast
68:59 - because that people would approach us
69:01 - being like how long did you rehearse
69:02 - that your back and forth was amazing and
69:04 - we were just like we didn't we're
69:06 - related we've been practicing this for
69:09 - decades um and uh yeah and when we both
69:12 - worked at Amazon we did like a live
69:14 - stream for the echo showing people how
69:16 - to how to work with like buttons and
69:17 - stuff together and that was so fun too
69:19 - so we we really enjoy working together
69:21 - but we like very different work
69:22 - environments yeah where uh like my my
69:26 - mom says like I'm like the wild west
69:28 - cowboy and she's the one who's like an
69:30 - English writer where she prefers like a
69:32 - lot of structure big organization all
69:35 - that and I kind of just don't want
69:37 - anybody to bother me as I do what I want
69:39 - to to start that's so interesting that
69:41 - you all have very similar like I would
69:43 - imagine probably pretty similar
69:44 - upbringing both growing up in Chicago
69:46 - both studying at the same school both
69:48 - studying in the same field working at
69:50 - some of the same companies and yet it
69:52 - sounds like personality wise and
69:54 - certainly in terms of preferences for
69:55 - career You're So Different yeah yeah
69:59 - exactly and like there's a lot of
70:01 - similarities don't get me wrong like we
70:02 - both married software engineers and and
70:05 - uh do have a lot of similar hobbies and
70:07 - stuff but yeah she she and I are very
70:10 - different in what we like in terms of
70:14 - what makes us productive and everything
70:16 - and and we both are very interested in
70:20 - Dev advocacy and teaching and helping
70:21 - developers but she approaches from a I
70:24 - have a big company with all of these
70:26 - resources if I can like play the system
70:28 - well enough I can offer this many
70:30 - resources to people and with me I like
70:33 - the scrappy approach where it's just
70:34 - like what can I do to provide these
70:36 - resources to people and and the we we
70:39 - both have varying levels of success with
70:41 - different approaches stuff but it it
70:43 - works well for both of us yeah it sounds
70:45 - like it um I mean you both obviously
70:48 - have these story careers and it's so
70:50 - interesting to see like how you've
70:53 - diverg
70:54 - one thing that I would like to talk
70:56 - about because you talked about
70:57 - productivity and you also alluded
70:59 - earlier to burnout is you are somebody
71:02 - who is like you have a literal baby like
71:06 - I think he said is like nine months old
71:08 - yeah and you also are a CTO and you're
71:12 - also creating all this content pretty
71:14 - reliably uh on like all these different
71:17 - platforms
71:18 - like how do you avoid burnout when
71:21 - you're doing all those things and have
71:23 - you ever gotten close to burnout and
71:25 - since you were getting close and like
71:27 - been able to pull back before you go
71:29 - over the burnout Cliff so to speak and
71:31 - have to like climb your way all the way
71:33 - up the mountain again yeah I've really
71:36 - had to learn how to say no um I think my
71:39 - my two biggest burnout times where um
71:42 - one point at venmo I I was saying yes to
71:45 - everything because I was like if I do a
71:47 - lot of work now while I like am young
71:49 - and have energy it'll be good for me
71:51 - later in very yes but it was terrible
71:53 - for me healthwise where like there was a
71:55 - period where I spoke at an event for 14
71:58 - days straight like including the
71:59 - weekends in addition to the 9 to-5 job I
72:02 - I just I was doing way too much and I
72:04 - just burnt out so hard after that I like
72:07 - ran off to Florida to hang out with my
72:08 - grandpa after that that's wild 14 man
72:13 - how did you like get from event to event
72:15 - was it just like was it all in like the
72:16 - Bay Area or some kind of Cal it was
72:18 - mostly in New York City and then yeah
72:20 - there was there's I think there's a
72:21 - little bit of travel like by train at
72:23 - point I don't even remember all of them
72:25 - because it was a bad choice um anyway so
72:30 - that that was a big one and then um I'm
72:32 - not counting College I kind of burnt out
72:34 - at one point in college it was fine I
72:36 - almost went blind but then I went moved
72:37 - to Spain and I was fine um and then uh
72:40 - the next one was at NFI I was really
72:42 - close to burning out and again that's
72:44 - why I ended up leaving where I still
72:46 - loved that team and everything but I was
72:48 - just I I had to for my health I had to I
72:51 - had to go um and and I think yeah now I
72:55 - see the signs more where I'm just like
72:56 - oo I need to cut back on this or that
72:58 - and and I think a lot of burnout it
73:00 - doesn't come from doing a lot because
73:02 - kind of like you said I I tend to do a
73:04 - lot but it's more doing a lot that isn't
73:07 - aligned with your values yeah and that
73:09 - isn't aligned with what's important to
73:11 - you we like my Weekly Newsletter it's a
73:14 - lot of work because it's weekly and
73:16 - there's there's a lot to do with it and
73:17 - stuff and I manage sponsors and and all
73:20 - of the interview practice question
73:22 - responses and and various content things
73:25 - like that but it's something that's
73:27 - important to me it's something that I
73:28 - ultimately like doing and my like goal
73:31 - of helping developers it works towards
73:34 - that goal and so it it doesn't cause me
73:36 - to burn out um and if I were to do
73:40 - something that is
73:42 - not aligned with what matters to me
73:46 - where it's it's truly just like I know I
73:47 - can do this but it's it's a ton of work
73:50 - I think that's that's what would cause
73:52 - me to burn out more interesting so doing
73:54 - things that are not aligned with your
73:55 - values that don't feel like they're
73:57 - advancing what you care about advancing
74:00 - that seems to be uh a theme but like are
74:02 - there any signs you said that you kind
74:03 - of saw the signs yeah uh of burnout and
74:07 - like what are the signs people should be
74:08 - looking for not caring
74:11 - anymore I feel like I feel like that's
74:13 - probably the biggest the biggest sign
74:16 - red flag thing that you could see where
74:18 - where if you start to be like resigned
74:20 - to this is this is just how it is I just
74:23 - don't care anymore I'm just kind of
74:24 - going through the emotions that's the
74:25 - biggest one for me cuz though I don't
74:28 - think like work should be everything to
74:30 - you I don't think that it should be like
74:32 - the thing that you only care about it
74:35 - it's something that you it's something
74:36 - that you do for so much of your life you
74:38 - should care about it a little bit and uh
74:42 - if you simply just don't care anymore
74:44 - it's it's kind of like the the opposite
74:46 - of Love isn't hate it's indifference
74:48 - it's it's that kind of stuff where where
74:51 - if you if you truly are just
74:54 - I I can tell when I'm starting to get to
74:56 - a burnout point where like if I'm in a
74:58 - meeting or something I'm just like none
74:59 - of this matters I don't know why like
75:02 - like you you kind of just like start to
75:04 - feel that and and I feel like that's for
75:06 - me that's the biggest number one sign
75:08 - more than any like tiredness or or
75:12 - stress things yeah I'm just trying to
75:15 - think of like if you find yourself in
75:17 - that situation where you feel you're
75:19 - just getting more distant from the task
75:21 - at hand you're carrying less about the
75:23 - outcome of different things uh good news
75:27 - resonates less positively with you it
75:29 - doesn't really lay bad news you feel
75:32 - numb what um what can you do to like
75:35 - shake that up like obviously burnout you
75:38 - you finished College despite getting
75:40 - almost going blind you said yeah is
75:44 - there is that a long story or is just
75:45 - like long story short I took way too
75:48 - many courses because I knew I was going
75:52 - to be moving to Spain and I wasn't
75:55 - sleeping I was sleeping on average like
75:57 - between 1 and 3 hours a night at the
75:59 - most and yeah almost went blind don't do
76:02 - that kids like you went to the doctor
76:04 - and they said if you keep doing this
76:05 - you're going to lose your vision like
76:06 - what like how do it wasn't so much if
76:08 - you keep doing this it was one day I
76:10 - couldn't open my eyes and they were like
76:14 - I I remember I went to vacation with my
76:17 - family and I had to wear an eye patch
76:18 - the whole time because like I literally
76:20 - couldn't open one of my eyes anymore and
76:22 - like we were at like a literally like a
76:24 - doctor in a poblo and he was just like
76:27 - something's wrong with your eye like the
76:28 - whites of my eyes were gray and and like
76:31 - they were just my eyes were
76:32 - disintegrating anyway you should sleep
76:36 - that's the that's the conclusion there
76:38 - okay yeah sleep PSA Public Service
76:41 - Announcement please sleep everybody
76:43 - sleep eight hours if you can yeah but
76:46 - but to answer your question though about
76:48 - like what you can do um first of all
76:52 - lean on your community I've said that
76:53 - before I feel like the the first answer
76:56 - that a lot of people might shout is
76:58 - self-care but if you shout self-care at
77:01 - someone who could use a community um
77:03 - that that's that's doing a disservice to
77:06 - that person it's it's really important
77:07 - to have people around you who can kind
77:09 - of talk to you and and like kind of kind
77:12 - of give you a reality check and and and
77:15 - be there for you but then also on the
77:17 - self-care front do things that you like
77:20 - and and just say no to certain things
77:22 - and be just like I need to step back
77:24 - from this or something and build a Lego
77:27 - set go travel and run off to Florida to
77:30 - see your grandpa like do do do something
77:33 - that that is very unrelated to work
77:35 - sometimes for me it's truly just like
77:37 - I'm going to just watch a K drama on
77:38 - Netflix I I I'm gonna do K my mom loves
77:42 - those they're so good but but yeah like
77:45 - like do do something that is like just
77:48 - for you to remind yourself I am a person
77:51 - Beyond this thing that I am not like
77:53 - doing and and sometimes like when I
77:56 - start approaching that moment I just do
77:58 - one of those things and I'm okay like a
78:00 - week later um and if it's something
78:03 - that's more prolonged and heavy that
78:05 - it's much harder to to fight against
78:07 - that but it's now acknowledged in
78:11 - multiple countries now that burnout is a
78:13 - real mental condition that that you need
78:15 - to fight against and you need to try to
78:18 - be proactive in leaning on the people
78:21 - that you care about be around people who
78:22 - care about you and do things that you
78:24 - care about yeah yeah I mean I I like to
78:27 - say that like you can accomplish so much
78:29 - in your life life is so long it's almost
78:32 - ridiculous how long life is and I say
78:33 - this as like a 43y old man who like
78:36 - can't believe that like if everything
78:38 - goes well I've got like a whole another
78:40 - 40 50 years to look forward to uh
78:43 - because it feels like life has been
78:45 - forever especially during the pandemic
78:46 - when time slowed down you can accomplish
78:49 - so much if you just don't burn out and
78:51 - just put forth like a consistent effort
78:53 - over time that's one of the things that
78:55 - really inspires me about you is you have
78:58 - kept going in terms of your newsletter
79:01 - for example you have kept going in terms
79:03 - of streaming in terms of creating these
79:05 - videos like you you you're not the kind
79:07 - of person who seems to get bored of
79:09 - something and just completely starts
79:11 - from fresh and like jumps from one fan
79:13 - flight of fantasy to the next like
79:15 - you're you're incredibly consistent over
79:17 - time and that's how I know that like I'm
79:21 - going to be excited to watch a cuz good
79:23 - things are are coming to you I want to
79:26 - talk about advice for people out there
79:28 - who may not feel that good things are
79:30 - coming to them and may not know how to
79:33 - get in the Rhythm like people that just
79:34 - got a CS degree and are having trouble
79:37 - uh applying for jobs people that are
79:38 - transitioning into Tech having
79:40 - difficulty applying for jobs there's
79:42 - like this kind of miasma in the air like
79:45 - oh Tech is dead like Developer jobs
79:48 - don't go there go go back to like
79:50 - culinary school or what real estate
79:52 - whatever kind of crap advice people are
79:54 - getting in my humble op like I don't
79:55 - want to B like don't go to culinary
79:57 - school I heard from so many chefs that
79:58 - like nobody goes to culinary school but
80:01 - like but yeah like like how do you
80:04 - counter that and how do you reassure
80:05 - people that no this The Sun Will Come
80:08 - Out Tomorrow you know it's just a rainy
80:10 - day yeah and that's that's the thing I
80:13 - feel like a lot of new devs or people
80:15 - who haven't been through a few spells of
80:18 - the oh no Tech is dying the they're
80:21 - they're just like oh my gosh Tech really
80:22 - is dying I'm kind of just like it's died
80:24 - before it's but it keeps coming back
80:27 - there like we are in an increasingly
80:30 - digital world and Tech is going nowhere
80:33 - like sure we're going there's like waves
80:35 - of layoffs and stuff happening economies
80:37 - come and go but it's going to come back
80:41 - and you might as well be prepared for
80:42 - when it does and and I already like
80:44 - knock on wood who knows what's going on
80:46 - but uh it feels like it's already coming
80:49 - back uh like jobs wise and stuff I was
80:52 - talking to a friend yesterday where she
80:54 - was saying I don't know if I should quit
80:55 - my job she saw my tweet about like the
80:58 - three things that you should have in a
80:59 - role and she's like I have barely one of
81:01 - these I but like I'm afraid to apply and
81:05 - I said I think things are coming back
81:07 - and she messaged me like two hours later
81:09 - saying oh my gosh there's so many jobs
81:11 - what nobody's talking about how many
81:12 - people are hiring right now everybody's
81:14 - just talking about the layoffs don't
81:15 - listen to the the loud people shouting
81:19 - that the sky is falling like keep an eye
81:21 - out for good opportunities because there
81:23 - are so many uh you just have to know
81:25 - where to look and you also don't have to
81:28 - work at a very traditional tech company
81:30 - you don't have to work for like the
81:32 - microsofts and the apples you could work
81:34 - for a company like General Mills which
81:36 - is where one of my internships were food
81:38 - compan company lots of tasty breakfast
81:41 - cereal oh my gosh I had so many snacks
81:43 - there it was an amazing place to work I
81:45 - loved General Mills um but anyway like
81:48 - if I move to Minneapolis Sunday it's
81:49 - because I want to work there um there
81:52 - there's there's so many companies out
81:54 - there that can offer you good pay work
81:57 - life balance that aren't tech companies
82:00 - um they a good culture good good
82:02 - learning opportunities and and you just
82:04 - have to be willing to look where where
82:06 - one friend of mine uh was so burnt out
82:09 - by the tech industry he was just like I
82:11 - I feel like I need to quit software
82:12 - engineering but I like software
82:14 - engineering but I'm just tired of this
82:15 - environment and and he decided to just
82:18 - look into health and be like well where
82:20 - how can I help like doctors and stuff
82:22 - without actually having to become one
82:24 - and now he works for a health tech
82:25 - company where it's very separate from
82:28 - the shouting on Twitter and and like the
82:30 - the what is the next thing after react
82:33 - type conversations and he loves it where
82:35 - he's able to do these skills that he has
82:37 - but he's working at a company that's not
82:40 - Tech related he's just using his Tech
82:41 - skills and and the stat that I've always
82:44 - heard is like two-thirds of Developer
82:46 - jobs are outside of what we
82:47 - traditionally consider Tech General
82:50 - Mills is not a tech company
82:53 - you know I would not argue that the car
82:55 - companies are tech companies or that
82:57 - Finance is Tech you know uh we we had a
83:01 - long conversation about this the other
83:02 - day uh I genuinely believe that uh if
83:07 - you're just looking at the big companies
83:09 - that are just doing these kind of
83:10 - layoffs like um a lot of which is like
83:13 - you know fast follower kind of like hey
83:15 - it's okay to lay people off CU you know
83:17 - this company just did so we're going to
83:19 - do it too right um and and a lot of
83:21 - employers will use like the the economy
83:23 - as an excuse for um just basically
83:26 - trying to have additional bargaining
83:28 - power over job candidates and things
83:30 - like that uh I love what you say don't
83:33 - listen to the loud people shouting that
83:35 - the sky is falling like don't listen to
83:38 - them the future is bright and one of the
83:40 - things that people shout a whole lot is
83:42 - AI is GNA take our gerbs right I mean
83:46 - what are your
83:47 - thoughts yeah it is but um like it's
83:50 - gonna improve but yeah
83:53 - I mean like that is probably the most
83:55 - common question I get uh every week I
83:58 - get dozens of emails I'm not
84:00 - exaggerating because I I send like 7
84:02 - million emails my email list is really
84:03 - big and uh when people reply they're
84:06 - like hey is any of this even matter like
84:09 - aren't the AI just going to be able to
84:11 - do everything the developer can do and
84:13 - better like uh they have this kind of
84:15 - old John Henry kind of like driving
84:17 - spikes uh thing in their mind but that's
84:21 - not how software works
84:23 - and you know I I don't want to answer
84:25 - the question before I ask it but like
84:27 - what would you say to somebody who feels
84:29 - like they skills are going to be quickly
84:31 - outmoded by Ai and that in the future
84:34 - nobody's going to have a job and stuff
84:35 - like what would you say to them because
84:38 - I think my my pet theory is that it's
84:42 - very easy to procrastinate learning to
84:44 - code because it's such a big ambitious
84:46 - Endeavor and it's it's really good like
84:49 - copium if you will to to just say like
84:52 - well
84:52 - it doesn't matter if I learn to code
84:54 - anyway because the jobs aren't going to
84:55 - be there so therefore my decision to
84:57 - play video games yeah exactly like what
85:01 - do you think yeah Tech isn't good or
85:03 - Tech is going to keep going on and AI is
85:06 - probably not going to take your job AI
85:08 - is a really good tool and I feel like
85:10 - you can use it as such where like I'm
85:12 - sure when someone invented the crane
85:15 - there are a bunch of construction
85:16 - workers saying like oh no what are we
85:18 - going to do this big heavy thing is
85:20 - going to lift a big heavy thing and and
85:22 - I won't lift a big heavy thing now
85:25 - they're just using that tool to help
85:26 - lift the big heavy things kind of like
85:29 - when Alpha go came out uh I play Go
85:32 - daily I love playing go it's like that
85:34 - grid with the black and white pieces and
85:36 - back in like very accurate portrayal in
85:38 - that uh Knives Out movie yeah that was
85:42 - that was so fun I made a Kickstarter for
85:44 - go back in the day and used a clip from
85:45 - it but anyway um it's it's such a fun
85:48 - game this Alpha go bot like beat out so
85:52 - many different players but that doesn't
85:54 - mean that people stop playing go it's
85:57 - it's still such a fun and interesting
85:58 - game and now Alpha go is great at
86:00 - teaching you moves there are some moves
86:02 - that professionals were just like this
86:04 - is the correct move in this scenario for
86:06 - hundreds of years and then alphago
86:09 - changed that for the first time and
86:11 - people were just like wait we just never
86:13 - saw that you can use these tools to
86:16 - unlock different ways of thinking and
86:18 - different ways of being productive where
86:21 - I think like GitHub co-pilot is a really
86:23 - good example where it is a co-pilot it's
86:26 - a thing that can help you write things
86:28 - it's not always going to be right you
86:30 - are ultimately in the driver's seat
86:31 - building something but it can help you
86:34 - where like I don't need to write yet
86:35 - another sorting function or I don't need
86:37 - to write yet another hello world react
86:40 - component that I can just add stuff to I
86:42 - can I can do that and you can let it be
86:44 - a tool that you use to get your ideas
86:47 - across and be more productive on things
86:50 - it doesn't have to be this thing that's
86:52 - it's just going to take your job and I
86:55 - don't think it's going to take your job
86:56 - for a while cuz some of the codes where
86:59 - I've been just like oh AI wrote this for
87:01 - me amazing has been so bad or later I'm
87:04 - just like wait why did I listen to the
87:06 - AI llms large language models are very
87:10 - good at predicting what the next word
87:11 - should look like but that doesn't mean
87:13 - it's the right word and they are so bad
87:17 - at math and I use math as an example
87:19 - because math is a very precise thing if
87:21 - you
87:23 - have it do like a demo function for
87:25 - something a lot of the answers are going
87:28 - to be wrong because it's not actually
87:30 - executing code it's not actually doing
87:31 - the logic just does what it thinks the
87:33 - logic should look like and so anyway all
87:36 - that being said yes it's getting better
87:38 - and better but that just means that you
87:41 - can use it to solve more interesting
87:44 - problems 100% agreed use AI as a tool
87:48 - don't use it as an excuse not to learn
87:50 - ma math programming computer science you
87:53 - should still learn these skills and um I
87:56 - hope that you know people will follow
87:58 - you and watch many of your amazing
88:00 - videos maybe even join your patreon
88:02 - community because it sounds like
88:04 - Community is like a big deal in cat City
88:07 - Williams land and the fact that you've
88:09 - had that Community there you've you've
88:11 - helped Yourself by having that community
88:13 - and other people in your community are
88:15 - helping one another um Community
88:18 - self-care is no substitute for having
88:21 - other people who have your back and
88:23 - having that feeling that you're part of
88:24 - a tribe and you can help other people
88:26 - and they'll help you that General Vibe
88:29 - of reciprocation so I've learned so much
88:31 - from this conversation with you and I'm
88:33 - going to encourage everybody to check
88:34 - out the show notes below where I've
88:36 - included lots of links to interesting
88:38 - stuff about Cassidy uh and I I just want
88:41 - to thank you for your time because you
88:42 - know you're a busy mom CTO you're doing
88:46 - all these things and I feel very
88:48 - grateful that you've taken the time to
88:50 - come on the free code Camp podcast
88:52 - thank you so much for having me it was a
88:54 - really fun time well everybody until
88:57 - next week happy coding
89:00 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back to the free Cod Camp podcast each week we talk with developers entrepreneurs and ambitious people who are getting into Tech this week I'm joined by Cassidy Williams AKA cassid do Hello thank you for having me yeah we're thrilled to have you here cassid where does that name come from that's your handle on Twitter and Tik Tok and all the things uh it came from my mom actually she would say like how do you do cassad do and I picked it as a username in college and it just kind of stuck everywhere awesome awesome yeah and everywhere indeed that's one of the things I want to just start off by talking about like how you are ubiquities I can't really even think of any developers who are on more platforms and and like putting out more stuff than you so just some quick background on Cassidy she's been a developer for more than a decade she's worked at tons of big companies she's worked at lots of small companies as well she's currently the CTO of a tech startup uh so yeah let's talk about all these places you are so you I guess my first exposure to you was maybe like four or five years ago like watching the short kind of Tik Tok videos and hearing about this developer who was like Making Waves on Tik Tok on the talk right I don't use Tik Tok myself uh I watch Like These two or three hour long video essays on YouTube and stuff but uh certainly a lot of people were sharing it and it was also making its way onto Twitter and like Reddit and places like that that I would normally see it so maybe you can talk about like content creation and like how you became so prolific with your crazy you know Dad joke humor my memes yeah your memes yeah yeah and so I feel like I always made memes but Tik Tok just made it easier to make more um where I I even loved making videos a ton just when I was young but video editing takes time uh as you probably know and so I I kind of stopped but it was always like a fun thing that I did um and then yeah when I when I got Tic Tac I was like wow this editor is so easy and I just started recording silly ones that I had ideas for back in I think it was like mid 2019 when I started and things kind of exploded from there I never intended to be a content creator it was just kind of me joking around about the state of development and went from there yeah so maybe talking a little bit about content Creation in general like what are some of the cassid do memes that people may have seen like the the short videos like is there one that it just like completely blew up that you were like wow like I had no idea this many people would appreciate this developer humor yeah I think this was like the second or third one I made where it was me singing the song Impossible from a Cinderella movie where it's just someone repeating impossible a bunch of times and it's when your code works on the first try and it was just a bunch of people going like impossible impossible and it just keeps repeating it and it's true because you should always be suspicious if your code just works on the first try it's also you're also like o I'm a genius but also I'm probably not what's going on um so I think that one related a lot and then I also uh I do a Halloween Tik Tok every year where I admit I don't make as many as I do as I did before because I just have less time but I still always do one on Halloween where I do a CSS trick and I hide the word boo somewhere in the Tik Tok at some point and uh as you do the CSS trick the word boo appears and I scream at the end that that one I feel like a lot of people they're just like I look forward to this one every year because I can't figure out what it is until I see it and so that one's pretty fun too yeah interesting so you kind of like recurring uh themes and Rec even like recurring kind of inside jokes from the cassid C Universe yeah there there's some where I definitely it's like such a specific joke where I'm just like hm there's maybe 10 people in the world who will actually get this joke but it's funny to me so I'm going to do it anyway where like one of them was very specifically a reference to the Dream Girls Musical and then if you know that Musical and the lyrics that I am singing in there and you know react and how the use effect hook works it's a really funny joke and it like combines the two of them but yeah there the people who got it they're like oh my gosh this is so specific but this is hilarious and then everyone else is like good job you know that the definitely a lot of them are Hit or Miss but it's it's fun to just kind of laugh at a very serious industry sometimes like as a very amateurish dad joke and I only do it among family you're not going to see me trying to crack dad jokes generally in like the free C Camp newsletter or on the free C Camp podcast or right anywhere where you get your weekly do Quincy Larson right um I am very scared of just like getting the Crickets effect because I was like too many references deep and like at what point does a joke become too esoteric and you're like I really don't have confidence that this is going to land with even like one out of every 10 people that like do you have like some heuristics that you use when I just make the joke anyway cuz if I'm laughing at it I know that I can have a good time and and like there there's some specific people who like my husband or my sister or something they will all they will always be just like oh my gosh that was dumb but I know exactly what you're referencing and so like I I I've got a few people in in my back pocket where I can be like you'll laugh at this and then most people where they're just like no Cassidy I'm okay with that I just kind of make the joke anyway yeah so to some extent like you can be your own barometer of relevance and trust that your life is experience is overlapped with enough other people that like you know you've got some audience out there that is going to appreciate it and sometimes like the most geeky if I can use that term like of humor it brings people together who feel like I thought I was the only one who was interested in Doctor Who and right or who had this experience or something like that yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly or like greatest showman in typescript or something like that like yeah you you never know who it might work for and at the same time if anything future me will laugh at the joke and so I I make the joke anyway awesome yeah that's a great Philosophy for being is just like I have faith that other people are going to be similar enough to me in some specific way that like it'll it'll work out I want to talk so I mean there's so many things we can talk about because there's just so many interesting Dimensions to you uh but one thing that is really interesting is just the extent to which you put yourself out there there are plenty of people who got a CS degree a computer science degree from like a good Public University here in the US and got good jobs at developers maybe got an uh internship in Microsoft right those coveted internships in big Tech that you got as a university student and they're just like cool I'm set I can write my own ticket I can get on the train and just enjoy my hobbies and work you know a reasonable amount of work and you know eventually retire and I can just be a professional Dev like I I suspect a lot of people go into like Fields like Dentistry or medicine or maybe even law just because they are remunerative stable careers where people are always going to have cavities you know like dentist are not going to go yeah yeah they'll always have teeth maybe they won't always have cavities but get the nanites in there cleaning the teeth for us but um a lot of people choose CS precisely because it's a stable income if they're like a first generation American or second generation and and they've got a lot of family to take care of like yeah uh for example a significant chunk of the Indian economy historically has been doctors Engineers people that are living in the United States who are making a lot of money and then remitting a lot of that back to their families their extended families I'm married to an immigrant so that's very real yeah I am too uh my wife uh uh she actually immigrated after we met in graduate school and we got married uh almost 20 years ago and then we moved back to the us and we went through the lengthy Green Card process and then the naturalization process she's a US citizen today uh but but yeah like I could totally understand if you're coming from that perspective of you didn't grow up you know middle class in like New York City or Los Angeles or something and you don't really have a lot to fall back on just getting a safe career like frankly being a developer is basically the safest career you can get in this sense that like I always like to say the Act of automating things is the last thing that will be completely automated and software Engineers are doing the automation so by definition like they'll be that's the last job that will ever exist probably right um but you have not rested on your laurels and you have not just checked out and just focused on you know living the good life and and making a lot of money as a developer and having cool creative you know selfactualizing work you've gone out there and you know put your reputation and like all this stuff on the line by attempting to make funny jokes on the internet where people might be mean to you right yeah what what drove you to do that so it wasn't so much me just being like I'm going to be funny and who cares what people say I think it was more just I a lot of the stuff that I do put out there I want to make Tech more accessible in general and so like I have a Weekly Newsletter and every single week I share like weekly links and a practice coding question and with the jokes I want Tech to not be as scary because honestly it's a very very serious industry that like you deal with certain bugs and you might think I'm the only one who's dealt with this and you're not like whe whether it's the paranoia of your manager calling you into a meeting or just your code not working on the first try or you suddenly saying like oh I I'll never be interested in some language and then you try it you're like wait I am it's amazing and and there there there's so many different things where uh I think especially in the pandemic so many people were very very isolated and uh a lot of the work that I've done it started pre pandemic but continued and and I went a bit harder on it to try to provide resources to people that I wish I had when I was learning yeah so that that's a big idus is like I want to make sure people have resources that I wish I had when I was learning yeah I mean it's very similar to free obviously like I learned code you can probably relate yeah um so was that the main reason is just like because a lot of the things you're doing like you're putting out learning resources and you know I would consider you an educator even though it sounds like you're mainly like an I mean you're I guess uh you worked in developer myself as an educator too so yeah yeah so I guess what were your roots in wanting to do that of course you start with this abstract goal I want to make it easier for people who are going through a journey similar to my own what what were the early days of content creation Cassidy like yeah content creation Cassidy who is she um I first started let's let me think I guess when I was in college I that's when I started doing things like uh being a TA for people or or a peer mentor for for people when I say ta teacher assistant and kind of just helping other students and stuff and um even earlier than that uh I we're going way back in high school when I was first getting interested in coding and stuff and there was no free code camp or anything like that at that point for me where I was just kind of like blindly trying to code uh and learn things I got involved with an organization called ncwit the national Center for Women and it and they were so helpful not so much to be just like this is how you code but like they got me connected to a lot of people who are so helpful to be just like this is something you should know or or like this is this is a thing that you should talk about or this is a thing that you should remember um just mentors even if it was just a a one hour mentorship session or or just something in passing and I think just being engaged with them from an early age just because I truly randomly saw their website and I was like I should try to apply for a SC um it it kind of just snowballed from there where uh one of the mentors that I had said lift as you climb where just as you move up in the industry you should try to lift other others up with you um and because as you move up in your role or somewhere there's going to be someone filling in the space behind you at all times and and it just benefits everyone over time um and yeah I think that was just something that hit me hard early and I kind of just rolled with it where after being super involved in high school and in college with NC Wht and I still am to this day not as much as I used to be but I do like resume workshops with them and stuff um it it just kind of snowballed where I was like oh well now that I'm in college I can give talks to high school students so that way they know like what to major in in college and I wrote blogs for my college to on like what the computer science major is like and then I started to like do aot of networking and meeting with people especially at internships and stuff in college and then from there as I got to see people in the industry before graduating I saw so many people where they were coding but they weren't just coding and I was like you know I like the idea of coding but not just coding and seeing what that could be and that led me to start doing Dev advocacy and stuff and the again it kind of just snowball where from there I was just like okay I'll go to hackathons and be a mentor okay and then from there I'll speak at conference and maybe teach some people things and then I started teaching online classes and I first started my newsletter because I thought oh I could teach people on the side of my online classes promote my online classes but then also help people out and so it just kind of kept growing over time where it it started with people helping me and then me realizing I should help others as well wow yeah it it sounds like you had uh a lot of people that were very inspiring to you and that you got hooked up early on with people who were kind of in your corner and could relate to a lot of the challenges you were facing and uh that I love what you said like lift as you climb that's such an amazing like I mean makes sense from like a rock climbing thing like you might have two people that are tethered together and like so you you climb up and and they're there to like help you in case you fall like they're provide some security because they're also connected to the wall and stuff I mean I've never G there's so many people where they probably don't realize the impact that they had on me where it was just like one person was an upper classman just at my school where where she was just helpful enough I was just like okay I'm going to listen to what she said and and the sometimes you never know like what small pieces of advice will hit and then carry you on and and that uh that kind of stuff I want to be able to provide advice that I wish I had um to as many people as I can yeah yeah and it sounds like you're reaching a lot of people just to put things in context like the degree of impact you're having uh not just as a developer not just as a CTO developer Advocate but creating courses teaching people how to code um you've got a ton of people of course watching your Tik Tok videos and by extension you know the videos are cross posted on Twitter I often see them like like you've got the pinned C locks oh yeah I encourage everybody to check out the the link to Cassidy's Twitter uh Cassidy's Twitter in the uh in the show notes because uh just checking out that one it's just you play all these different characters and and that's one of the things I don't know if that's like a Tik Tok thing but it'll be like one person playing like all these different roles and uh maybe they're wearing uh like a hat in one or they're wearing many wigs I I I think wigs are so fun and so I'm just like this is a good opportunity to just have a different hat yeah I mean it's it's like a campy way of so economizing like because you don't need to get more people involved you can really DIY it you can literally be this sole writer producer director actress like actor all all those different things in the show and you don't need really anybody's permission to do anything and then you just have like the editing tools you make it and then you you Syndicate it across all these different things of course you've got your newsletter that I'll like I enjoyed reading some of the back issues of it always includes a joke it's worth signing up just for the joke definitely just read it to scroll to the joke yeah yeah I mean at least they're reading it and getting some uh benefit from it yeah yeah hey if anything what's fun is I I used to only do Tech jokes or or like most of them would be Tech jokes but then a bunch of people started saying like thank you so much for these jokes I read it to my grandma every week and I'm just like oh my gosh I'm going to do non Tech jokes so you can read more to your grandma but uh yeah the jokes are great yeah uh like free C Camp my email every week includes a quote of the week and and recently of course I quoted one of your quotes about like some joke you made about get and uh it it was something about like I don't want to misquote it do you remember I honestly I literally wrote a blog post about get like a half hour before this recording so it could be anything yeah there are lots of like uh puns that you can make around get especially because I I think like there's so many weird mixed analogies in get and so many of the commands it's like like how did you go like get blamed that was a real head scratcher like such a rude way blame someone yeah I I saw someone made like an alias where it was get props and it's the same thing as blame it just makes you feel a little better about it yeah the toxicity of tech is built right into the tools themselves blaming people though um yeah I uh so you also stream on Twitch and I'd be curious to learn I haven't actually watched any of your streams yet I'm hoping to catch them like I don't spend a lot I watch vods on um YouTube that people upload video on demand so I never watch I watch everything on YouTube like double speed it twitch it's just like onx is too slow for me like no offense if anybody here is like finding this conversation dragging a little bit just go and bump the speed a little bit and I promise it's like way more everything is more interesting at 2x um and I do that for all my podcasts like basically every piece of content my wife won't even watch movies with me anymore CU I double speed them um oh gosh movies too sometimes you know it depends on like if it's like you know like a a late night kind of like guilty pleasure like watch of some 8s or a really really really slow movies where it's like we're walking across the sand Blade the new Blade Runner one was slow as heck um it was a good movie but it was slow like man AB some respectful people's time I'm sure like all the the you know filmmakers in the audience are like crying don't you yeah but anyway I do stream yeah talk about that yeah so I and I admit I've slowed down a little bit because I had a baby and it's not as easy to live stream weekly but I've been trying to get back to my regular weekly Cadence of streaming and it kind of started where once again I I thought it might be useful to teach people something and then kind of talk about it and so typically what I would do when I first started streaming um myself I had streamed before like with my sister and stuff Tech things but um I I would talk for like a half hour to an hour about like whatever questions people had jobwise or or technical questions opinions about the latest hot new JavaScript library or something like that and then after that I'd go into some project that was like recurring weekly and everything and I admit I leaned more towards the first part because people were so they had so many questions um for a while until a lot of my stream ended up being mostly just like a Q&A session seeing what like what questions can answer for people or just hang out and cowork um but then yeah some other ones where it's I'll be like I really want to work on this library today so I'm just going to code and I'll check out the chat and see if yall have questions from there but yeah it's it's a very casual stream I I admit I should probably be more like consistent about it there have been times where I'm just like I'm not streaming this week because I have a really good sandwich here's a picture of it see you next week and so like it really just varies from from week to week but uh yeah it's it's fun to just kind of chat with people in the community especially once again it's a very remote World um especially uh post pandemic we're still kind of in it eh um and and being able to interact with people in the community yeah yeah so being out there especially like real time communicating with chat and uh as you're on stream like doing Q&A sessions or just live coding and answering people's questions as they fire them in uh I did stream for like a couple years years uh while I was building a lot of the early versions of free Cod camp but it just um I got some the same question so many times over and over I'm like I'm just going to write articles and writing articles like I I got a lot more I guess help helped a lot of people more a lot definitely I I have like an ask me anything repo on GitHub you can go to cast. run um I I have like an ask me anything repo where it's like frequently asked questions and then also yeah if I get a question repeatedly I'm just like okay I'll write a blog and then I can just kind of link it to people so I don't have to keep me saying it what questions do people ask I'm just curious like what would be the most asked question about you that is not specific to like how do I get you know fix get detached head or something but like not a technical question but just a question about you in general yeah um I should pull up my repo but uh let's see people often ask like startups versus big companies people often ask like should I get a computer science degree um they often ask what mechanical keyboard should I buy yeah uh what's it like being a woman in Tech uh should I write a cover letter for my job okay so practical uh you know yeah so so some some of them are practical some are very specific to my experience okay cool well we are going to talk about several of those things that just mention I can just link to this episode yeah mechanical keyboards something that you're interested in uh something that I I happen to have a mechanical keyboard I just use it when I'm on a PC and when um but I I have these little remote Mac ones like this because they're Compact and yeah chick you're like ah Sak blue no like like what is your interest in and how did they come about in mechanical keyboards it really just spiraled where I it started with me just wanting a pretty keyboard where I was just like my desk should be cuter and I always have just like a really boring looking keyboard and then I realized you could customize keyboards and then I just kind of took a nose dive deep into the entire keyboard Community where um there was a point I I lived in New York for several years and then moved to Seattle and I remember one of my coworkers that I was speaking to in New York right before moving he had the coolest keyboard and I just started asking questions like okay you 3D printed that and what switches are these what does this mean and so I just asked him a bunch of questions and then moving to Seattle Seattle is a hobbyist city I've said it before and I will always say this people are so into their hobbies in Seattle where and anything that you could be interested in you will find people interested in that where it's I admit it's kind of hard to make friends outside of of just the hobby but the hobby itself huge and so when I got to Seattle I just went in deep where I ended up being like on the board for nonprofit that taught kids Electronics via soldering mechanical keyboards and reran the Seattle mechanical keyboard Meetup that had like 3 to 400 people bringing their keyboards and that's a lot of people for a keyboard meet up my goodness like it was amazing and and like we had talks on like manufacturing and on stenography and and and so many cool things and and yeah I just kind of got really really deep and then I started designing keycaps because keyboards are expensive and I was just like if I design keycaps maybe I could get some free key caps so I'm not spending too much money that did not help me but hey some some of the key casts behind me I designed those ones I designed those ones I like it it just kind of became a fun thing where I just got really involved with this community that likes making things pretty and functional it's it's reminds me of just like Legos but with more electronics and it's very fun yeah I suppose as a developer you're kind of a crafts person and your tools of the trade your keybo right like that's that's how you kind of interface with the machine is uh and typing keyboards are never going to go out of style because you can type so efficiently and I love typing like whenever I need to think I open up a text editor I just start typing and and that's kind of like I use the pages kind of like an external brain for organizing my ideas I love typing uh what is it about typing and like keyboards that just you think get so many people to care about the kind of tool that they're using because you said it you had 400 people in Seattle by the way I'm interested like this is the first time I've ever heard the notion of Seattle is a developer or like I'm sorry like a hobbyist city do you think that has something to do with like all the rain and people staying indoors more yes I 100% that that's exactly what it is I think people are just like well we can't go outside because it's so rainy I guess we're going to get really into this one specific thing I and and there might be some seattleites who disagree but I'm going based on a lot of experience and what I saw um and yeah anyway typing is just it's something that you do it's something fun and also I'm going to shill my startup a little bit to talk about thinking out things but anyway uh yeah when I type on a mechanical keyboard and depending on the different switches all of my keyboards have different switches and different feels and stuff it's it's just kind of fun because it feels different depending on the keyboard that you use and some keyboards make you feel more productive some some are more loud some are more quiet I'm using a quiet one now because whenever I do recordings I have a silenced keyboard because I don't want to be clack clack clack that kind of stuff and so it's it's just kind of fun to have different options and different feels as as you type and and some keyboards I genuinely just type faster on and so I can type at the speed of thought kind of like what you're were saying yeah I when it comes to just like whistling while you work kind of like you're you're going to spend so much time typing like I don't know how do you have any idea like how many key strokes you make on your average day have you ever tried tracking that or anything like that I haven't I should but there's a lot yeah I I imagine you're just constantly typing and like that little tactile feedback it's just like people get really into their cars and like like having the the feel of the car against like exactly how much it slides how it feels when you're accelerating or when you're Switching gears and stuff like I can imagine like developers get the same thing cuz you're kind of doing a lot of those cheaper than a car yeah yeah well how much would like a like a middling mechanical keyboard like a starter mechanical keyboard start you can start relatively cheap I I actually just helped a friend buy one who has never gotten a keyboard before and and I think it was like $40 and and it was it's a nice keyboard like that's going to last for a long time um it they get pricey I I've I've typed on keyboards like at these meetups where it's like oh this is a $3,000 keyboard you type it you're just like oh that's why this is nice but I don't $3,000 keyboard I don't I don't need to go that far but I get it yeah so if money is No Object and you want to have like the best feel then yeah people people spend a lot of money on their Hobbies right I I think that's a reasonable use of of funds uh so let's talk a little bit about uh your startup because you mentioned that you're you know you're CTO and you it's you have uh wall jump many times from company to company over the years and you're like really high up now you're basically it's the Pinnacle as a developer unless you want to go find your own company uh the the pinnac and a lot of Founders are CTO as well maybe you could talk a little bit about that and ideation and and just getting your thoughts down on paper yeah cont contenda is that what it's called contenda yeah but uh we we're in a pivoting stage so we're building an app called brain story and we're uh speaking getting ideas down on paper that's what brain story does so sh'll Break um what we do at uh on brain story is you just talk to your browser about an idea you have and it could be you could be brainstorming like a whole new side project a blog post a conference talk you could just be wanting to talk out while you want to prep for a podcast or a meeting and as you talk it helps guide you uh as you as you speak where I could I could say to brain I'll be just like okay I know I want to build this feature in a side project but I don't know what the UI should look like it just asks me questions like okay well what's the most important thing about this UI and it so it it uses AI but it's not generative AI it just talks back to you and forces you to talk and then as you talk out your ideas Eureka you get answers and so I use it to write and speak and do a lot of things so what you're telling me is I'm spending all this time prompting AI but AI could be prompting me exactly yes and and and yeah and and I think that's the main differentiator and that's why we're we're trying to gear it more towards like students and nontechnical people because a lot of developers will be just like well I could just build this with GPT I'm just like kind of but it's once again you're not prompting the computer the computer's prompting you to speak it's it's we call it iterative AI instead of generative AI yeah um but anyway startup things I uh I've been with contenda for a long time for for about three years but I actually started as an adviser for them um and we can get into advisory things in a bit but um my CEO she was a part of my patreon group which I have a patreon where I can help people like with resume reviews and have a Discord group and stuff so just to give people some context like maybe they would subscribe and like pay you you know $1 a month and then if they're at the higher tier maybe they get like a a oneonone call with you every month or something like that and yeah and so like cheapest one is literally the lowest tier that patreon will give me and it's $2 a month and that just gives you access to the Discord and having that little pay wall is really good for keeping spammers out and so that that's that's that one but then yeah if you do $15 a month I'll review your resume and so we'll all the community to like give you tips and then there's like an interview prep one where like I'll get on oneonone calls with you for as long as you do it to help interview prep with you um so anyway that's that's what that is and so anyway my CE she was a part of this patreon and she was just playing video games and kind of chilling in the group and she noticed that I was mailing stickers to everybody in the group by hand which took a lot of time and um she said hey if I build something that helps you mail stickers to people would you use it and I said yes cuz I'm getting a hand cramp from writing envelopes um and so she built a tool that we now call contenna which which mailed stickers to people and it did so well it actually helped lewig on Twitch break the world record for the most number of subscribers um which was cool but stickers don't really like Venture scale and so it she I I was an adviser at that point trying to like give tips as she was kind of working on this and then uh she had founding Engineers to help out and they ended up building tools for like helping you retain subscribers as a Creator and then eventually before the gpts came out it was transforming content where you could say like turn this podcast into a Blog post or turn these videos into tweets or something um and then the gpts came out and all of a sudden everybody knew about Ai and so there's so many pivots in there to try to be just like here's how we're different here's how you could do this but um because Chad gbt and all these tools came out the differentiating factors were getting Slimmer and Slimmer and so we were pivoting more and more again um and we had a developer API and in this time I joined as CTO um and so I I've been I've been full time as CTO for over a year now year and a halfish time isn't real but anyway not after the pandemic yeah seriously though it's it's wild um but anyway we had a developer API with our previous product and we thought oh let's build just like mini apps on top of our Dev API and see what could work and we had built this tool that we designed to help high school students write college essays um where it wouldn't write the essay for them but they could could just talk out like essay questions um and figure out like how they might want to frame their essay and it worked so well we were like wait a minute this could apply to others too and so we we thus brain story was born and it's just helps you talk out your ideas for anything and people have used it to plan D and D campaigns some people use it to like write literal like standup comedy sets um there's a big like contingent of like sports psychology like improving your mindset around certain by just talking it out performance Coes yeah yeah ex which is really just therapy but it's like therapy for professionals yeah exactly uh honestly there there was one user that where we were doing like a user test and she said I think this knows me better than my therapist we're like no this isn't a therapist we don't want that legal burden but uh that's what brain story is and and it's been really fun to work on very cool it is cool like you know just to give context if anyone hasn't heard the term pivot like a lot of times startups early on they everybody's trying to get traction right they trying to get a whole lot of people to you know essentially like use their product or you know better yet give them money so that they can go and they can get more funding and they can expand and you know do all these things that that startups do and uh so a pivot is just generally where you completely change your product or maybe it could be a smaller pivot like instead of doing like something in the same space you you your solution is slightly different you take a different approach AI caus a lot of companies to Pivot over the past few years uh and uh you know it also costs companies like Che that like you know would help people with their uh their homework and stuff uh you don't need to pay for you know answers to test questions and stuff like that so you can cheat on your test if you got like something like uh a foundational llm that can like help you just answer all the questions real quick and like teach you that stuff right so um yeah it's been quite tumultuous uh but I'm glad to hear that you all have been able to actually not only pay it but also incorporate some similar approaches even if you're not using like an llm per se uh I'm not sure do you do you all use llms at all yeah we we do some under the hood we we've done so many things custom where we're like now we're just like dang GPT makes this easy and so there we we uh do have some gupt stuff under the hood but a lot of it we've we've built in housee yeah and just to be like I have a policy like on the podcast I always explain acronyms even though I've said it probably a many times llm large language model uh gp4 being uh probably the most popular large language model so um and spoiler alert we we do have an interview with uh the first developer Advocate uh at open aai uh and she and I are neighbors we were just talking recently we're like so we live less than 10 minutes apart Chicago Connection wow Patrick being the person we're talking about yeah um you've lived in so many cities I know this is like a really bad transition you've lived in so many cities like so you grew up in Chicago then you moved uh to Ohio to go to Ohio say Iowa I always get those four letter O names mixed up Iowa State uh and then while you were there you of course got your CS degree and you've lived in like where what are other major cities of a bunch of cities yeah so so I've lived I yeah moved to Iowa for school and then for my internships I lived in Minneapolis Seattle and then the San Francisco Bay Area um I also lived in Spain for a good chunk of time for studying abroad and loved it that was amazing everybody should study abroad if they have the opportunity it's it's so great and I've gone back to Spain so many times since like it it I've maintained friendships there H it was the best um and then I lived in New York City after graduation for three years three or four years you lived in like every major city except for Dallas pretty much and then and then I lived in I lived in Seattle after that and then in the pandemic moved back to Chicago yeah wow so you you've like hit basically every major city and one of the things that is that really intrigues me about your career this past decade plus that you've been working in Tech is that you've changed jobs a lot and there's conventional wisdom that like oh you get a job and you keep it for at least two years you don't have gaps you don't have uh you know you don't want to have to explain your your job changes to uh some HR person because it's an awkward conversation but um you know did they quietly push you out and then you just resigned and made it look like you Chang jobs or like there's always that suspicion like looming over like why this person keeps changing jobs are they just not a good fit or are they overly careerist and they're just trying to ascend the ladder as quickly as possible like why have you changed job so much and like and what do you think are the stigmas around that and do you think they're warranted yeah yeah I think there are stigmas around it and and for some of them yes like I will say if you see a bunch of people work I I've talked to people I'm just like all of your jobs have been like two months or less that's very short I I try to I try to stay a little bit longer at places and I never go into a job thinking like I'm going to be out of here in a year I I always try to to stay as long as possible but just life happens and I think just as an aside it's really good to do like life audits to be like are you going in the direction where you want to be going um and is your job stopping you from doing that um and so after college I went to venmo and I was a Dev Advocate there it was really fun I I was working on the product itself um I built blocking so if you ever block someone but no that was me um cool and then uh also how does that work you block people they can't send you money anymore or do people send you money like is there a messaging client or something well people would like be annoying people or harassing people by just sending one cent at a time with like annoying payment messages ah people people be annoying but anyway um so loved being at venmo it was a really really cool place to work they were bought out and um them right yeahp right yeah PayPal bought them and and this was before eBay and PayPal split and stuff and and they were actually bought by a company named Brain tree and PayPal bought them we jokingly called it ventry palb because it was venmo brain tree PayPal eBay and then like PayPal and eBay split while I was there chaotic time so a lot of chaos that was completely out of your control and and you just want to like work on product and yeah there's probably all kinds of org changes and like they ended up discontinuing the API and as a Dev Advocate what are you supposed to do if the API is going away like that kind of stuff and so I ended up leaving because like I was talking to fellow coworkers on like the brain tree and PayPal side and they're just like they're not going to be supporting you much longer if you have an opportunity you should probably get out of Dodge and so that's why I ended up leaving um yeah and and I'm so grateful to them they were they were really kind people who I still keep in touch with who were like looking out for me in that regard and um so anyway yeah I left that's not the only time your company that you've been working at has been acquired right like is that happened another time that's yeah so that that's happened that happened again so after venmo I went to a company called clarify they're an AI startup um I think they're series C now they do cool like image recognition things I I loved working there too I actually worked with my sister there for a little bit of time before she went off to Google and um I moved and remote work wasn't as much of a thing then and so I was moving from New York to Seattle and that is what caused me to do that job change where just personal life things and so after that I went to a company called L4 L4 digital which was a creative Agency on Seattle Super loved that too it was also bought out and so that that one was bought out by a a large company based in Argentina called glent and um it was it was cool kind of being involved with them but uh they were very quickly changing a lot of the company culture and everything and and uh it it just it just wasn't the kind of environment that I was really wanting to stick a part of but I but I really enjoyed that job cuz I was an engineering manager there as well as just engineering on a bunch of cool client projects um but yeah eventually I was just like the I think I was there a little more than a year and a half but the large company changes were uh kind of messing with the the culture enough that I decided to go and then I went to Amazon which was a bad choice um for me I'm sure there are people who love their jobs at Amazon and are there for a long time but I knew like two weeks in that they pay very well but at what cost and it was like truly a golden handcuff situation and so I tried to stick it out but there came a point where I was just like the money is not worth it I'm really unhappy here um and so I quit after about seven months at Amazon and then went to Coden which was awesome yeah codepen amazing tool C is such a great tool yeah and I I still talk to those people to this day like literally yesterday um they're they're such a great team and I really loved working on codepen um building out features and stuff and it was just a straight up software engineering role not Dev advocacy or anything but as a result I was kind of missing the dev advocacy stuff um and so I would like still occasionally speak at conferences and and uh do more developer facing things and that was where I started doing the Tik Tock and and just started kind of doing more public things while also working on the product um but they needed they needed someone who's just software engineering who who wasn't doing the dev advocacy stuff and and uh are doing like the public speaking things and we we kind of tried to see if there was a balance there and and honestly there just wasn't there were just like we're so sorry but we can't really support like you going to conferences and stuff we need you to be engineering and um so we parted ways I I I was just like I love you guys but I'm going to go do something for developers because I really like the teaching aspect um and uh yeah the that one was a shame because I I really loved working at codepen I just wanted to be working with developers more and um so then I went and became a fulltime teacher and so I I was teaching at a company called react training fulltime and it was great I was I was traveling a ton and just giving workshops on how to write react better all the time um that is where I started live streaming a bit more on on the react side too it was great um and then the pandemic happened and uh at that I guess that puts a Kash on like a lot of the activity that you would have as a teacher if you're doing like inperson workshops and stuff it did yeah I was I was doing so much iners stuff that like I called 2020 in January I was like this is going to be my year of travel I'm going to do like a last Terra and then I'll stop and so like I went to Austria I went to Boston I went to SF I went to France I went to Ireland I I went to Hawaii I was traveling a ton just in January and February and then in early March I was coming back from Dublin I was going to be home for three days then go to Spain and then shut down and everything started shutting down and digital workshops weren't just simply weren't as much of a thing at that point people probably were less inclined to pay a lot of money companies were probably less inclined to send their employees to something that is just a virtual webinar type thing and so like within two weeks react training had to shut down cuz we just W two weeks well at least I mean kudos to them for rep recognizing the writing on the wall that this was going to be a big thing the biggest thing that's happened in our lifetime probably hopefully the biggest thing that will happen in our lifetime yeah it was it was wild and and it was such a shame too cuz we said at the beginning of March we're like we have so many workshops in March we just have to get through March and then we'll have runway for like two or three years and we couldn't get through March so um anyway that that that is what led me to leave react training because the company shut down and uh then I went to NFI after that and nlii was great I I was doing Dev advocacy on act in xjs there and had a blast and and I did that for for a while um and then after like almost two years I was just starting to burn out a ton because I moved up into management as like a director of Dev experience there and uh it was just it was so much work um but it was like a combination of doing the director work and the individual contributor work um where I was still like coding writing blog posts doing all these things but I was also in meetings like so so many meetings like 11 to 15 meetings a day it was like like 10 minute meetings or like how are you doing no they were not I I like it was it was too much and and the it was the kind of thing where I really loved the product and working on it I just physically couldn't handle it anymore um and so I ended up I ended up leaving because I I was just burning out but I'm to this day I'm still an adviser for them where like I still talk with them regularly and stuff and have a great relationship with them because I do like the product and what they're doing I just was so tired yeah they're they're a cool company and you know I as I always like to tell the tale of me being in hackathons with Matt bman the founder uh and they've been a supporter of Freo Camp early on uh as well and we we have used their tools over the years um so many things to talk about so many things and I I still have two more jobs to go okay go ahead let's continue yeah and so after that I I considered starting my own thing and like took a little break cuz I was like maybe I will maybe I will then I didn't and I ended up going to remote remote.com to uh I was ahead of developer education there and I was going to see like okay what what resources can I provide for remote developers remote grew so fast where when I first started talking with them in like early pandemic days just like friendly they were at like 25 people then when I interviewed it was more like 200 people wow which was quite a big jump but I joined they were at a thousand people they exploded in growth you can't gr that quickly without making a lot of bad hires in my opinion like I just don't I don't believe for a second that an organization can grow that quickly without cracks forming I it was yeah and unfortunately I think I kind of was falling through some of those cracks where like everybody was so kind and and there's such lovely people there which once again still stay in touch with them um but it just grew so fast and and I would be working on something like I I ran like the devs for Ukraine conference to uh help support developers there and people there to raise money and I I was able to do some cool initiatives but so many things I was just like hey this is like the plan for this and people would say Cassidy that's awesome we don't have time for that because it was growing so much um and so anyway I really liked it there but it just it was so much um and then this is where like the personal things came into play I got pregnant and I was just like is this the kind of role that I want to continue doing while I'm pregnant and will I have the flexibility to like be able to take care of my kid and stuff and um that's when I started talking more with contendo where I've been I had been an adviser for them for a year a year and a half for them at that point and um they had been talking to me about how they wanted to find a CTO to fill in some gaps and so as I was talking with them I was like so what if I was that CTO and and uh we kind of talked as a whole team and it just kind of was a very natural fit where I knew everybody really well I had met with them in person a bunch of times and and we we were like friends in addition to colleagues and stuff and yeah it just seemed like the right fit and I've been with them ever since awesome so many different stops your journey uh and uh I'm going to link to your LinkedIn in case anybody wants to to follow you there or like read through I was in I was like you know she's she's younger than I am uh I don't know I'm not going to ask your age but you're like way younger than me and yet youve worked at like 10 times as many places as I am I think it's it's wild like I think there were like 20 plus entries on your like experience so many of it is like advisory roles and like parttime things too but yeah I and it like when I go into the story like that companies never question why I have such a big resume they're just like oh well of of course oh yeah that makes sense like it's it's never me just saying I wanted more money so I left it's it's usually you have good reasons for every single thing and one of the two of the reasons that I do want to drill deeper into one is you know the notion of culture which a lot of people uh who are privileged just like culture doesn't even exist what is that it's like nonsense you know Corp culture always exists yeah what are what you would call cultural indicators uh and and maybe we can back up and we can talk about if you don't mind me just saying your experience in Tech as a woman because women uh I don't like it but women are a minority in Tech I think they depending on like maybe maybe you have like a good estimate of the number of women in Tech or the proportion of women in last stat I saw was 133% 133% yeah and there was like a stack Overflow survey a few years ago where like 6% of the respondents were women or something like that that it was like really low um and of course like I can tell you like fre Co Camp we're very proud that about a third of the people learning on free Camp are women that's not 50% but right but still that's good proportionally compared to a lot of the industry and it's going to be a multigenerational effort to get more women into Tech uh in my humble opinion uh there are lots of cultural things and a lot of economic reasons and a lot of just like systemic you know bias reasons uh but maybe you could talk a little bit about your own kind of like entree into Tech and the first time that you felt like wow I I didn't realize there were so few women in Tech yeah I found out early on that there were not many women in Tech because I took AP Computer Science in high school where I first started coding before that where I was just like oh wait you can make websites and I was really excited to play around with with HTML CSS JavaScript and just kind of was figuring things out and was having a blast doing it and then when I realized that my school was offering AP Computer Science I was like oh I'm going to take that and and it'll be great and literally the first thing that the teacher said in the class on the first day was as you can see we have a girl this year I was like oh and uh yeah that that that was a very rude awakening where it just the that was the theme for a lot of girl this year that's wild yeah that that was my first like group inter action um but that is how I found NC wit which I mentioned earlier where where like and what what is National Center for Women in it I'm going to link to that yeah they're awesome they they have uh awards for high school girls every year and then they also have a Collegiate organization they they're they're a research organization so they put together really good uh research um and informationals that companies can use and stuff they're they're a really great orc but any anyway I first got involved with them because in that class when I would like finish an exercise and had time I would just start like looking up like how do how do I find other girls because I just didn't know where they were um and yeah so that that's how I first got involved with NY wit um because I was looking for a community where I didn't have one yet so you were not content to just accept that like okay everybody I interact with is going to be a dude you very early tried to like build connections with other women at Tech yeah and like I'm okay with I'm okay with hanging out dudes and I kind of have to be because because of the nature of tech and and so many of my college courses there would be like one or two of us or or something just funny story recently I was I was just walking around in Chicago and I saw one of the girls where she was like the other one in my course and we looked at each other like you live in Chicago hi and like we just hadn't seen each each other since college and it was cool to be just where like we were introducing our husbands and we were just like she was the other one we this is great um the bond it's it's forever but uh anyway it it was something where like I knew there had to be something out there and then luckily there was and it's something where in general I think you should have a community no matter the industry to stay in it where people have your back um where like whe whether whether it's a diverse one or not it should be a diverse one but you know like it it's having a community that can check on you and be just like hey how did this thing go I know you were worried about it or hey good luck on your job interview this day or or let's talk through this problem you're having or something Have having that kind of community is so so valuable and I think is particularly pretty hard again in this postpandemic world but again that's why I have like my patreon Discord group we have we are such a great Community where it's just us talking about this is this is what I'm trying to learn right now and uh there's there's so many good ones associated with free code camp and on Twitter and and various places have having those communities is so important and that's that's been something that has been so helpful to me throughout my career yeah and so you've talked a little bit in the past about like kind of cultural indicators that you look for to companies you even tweeted a few days ago I think I was scrolling through your Twitter earlier that you think that companies should offer three different things and if they don't offer at least two of those three things you shouldn't consider them as like a serious opportunity uh maybe do you recall what those three things were yeah and so that that's while you're at the company or while you're interviewing they should have good pay good culture and good growth opportunities yeah two out of three is pretty good all three would be great um but if if you're at a company and you realize oh I only have one out of three or something or or I don't have any of these or or something you might want to question why you're there that doesn't necessarily mean jump ship because having a job is good but yeah if you if you don't question those kinds of things then you will be stuck in a situation that's not serving you well yeah well I would argue that like just from looking at the job application you can probably figure out the compensation if they publicly list that and you you might even be able to surmise like software engineer 2 probably leads to software engineer 3 probably leads to like Engineering Management you know role uh so like assuming it's like a big tech company and that people do gradually rise up the ranks um that is that's basically two of them that you can kind of surmise just from doing a little bit of research but culture is a little bit trickier and how would you establish whether a company has a you know a healthy culture that's like conducive to being able to work and be sane and stuff like that how would you figure that out if you were on the outside and you were looking at a company and considering applying what what are the uh kind of the telltale signs of like potentially toxic culture yeah well so first of all one that I've seen and where I've actually like gone in the other direction is where they say oh we don't really have a culture yet all companies have a culture like if you say that there is no culture that means that there might not be a great culture like like all companies have have some element of culture there um but then I also I'm very curious to sus out how people communicate across an orc um and so I typically one question that I actually ask in job interviews is what's the most important thing the customer the product or the employees and none of those answers are wrong like those are all actually like they're they're all three important but if you were to pick one what what is the most important customer product or employees um and what's interesting about the answers is how people answer them and if that answer is consistent across interviewers where like when I interviewed at Amazon every single person said the customer like it was a very very clear customer Obsession right I customer Obsession that's what they're all about yeah and and so you know that they communicate well on that front and granted the culture wasn't that great when I was at Amazon but it it it was a good indicator of how people communicated and when people answer that question differently then it's interesting to see okay why do you why do they answer it differently how did their answers differ um when they explain it because sometimes the the way they explain it you're just like oh it makes sense why this person would answer this way and this person would answer this way but um again none of those answers are wrong but it's useful to see we're like when I internet into it I I've been doing this for a lot many years now internet into it everybody said oh the employees are number one and and here's why I think it and and it's it's cool to see how people communicate about what their environment is and then one last one that uh that I like to ask is just if you had a magic wand and could change anything about the company what would you change um and seeing people do that where like like it's not necessarily a bad thing but what what is the magic wand that that thing that you would change people's answers there are very good ways to sus out how things are where sometimes people are just like I would get rid of this group in the company where where it's just like I I don't want we have too many product managers or something um sometimes the answer has been I don't like that we're under the fist of capitalism I would probably wish away our VCS or something like that and and you can kind of see what is the thing that drives uh culture or NE anything negative or or something at the company and so anyway those are the questions I answer and it's been pretty helpful for those are great questions um especially like what would you wish away man like when you as that I was like what would I well we're not interviewing me here but one thing I would wish away is the complexity of the US immigration system I would I would love to be able to say to everybody who works at freeo Camp we're going to get you and H1B visa and if you want you can come and live here in the US um so that unfortunately that's yeah I mean you you probably I don't know how much of the immigration system you've had to go through with your husband but it was it's been it's been yeah yeah it's quite complicated to uh to get even like so we have a team member here in the US and sorry I'm not going to like bash the us but I will bash the US immigration system that is one thing that I've I think that's fair it's within my right as a US taxpayer as somebody who works to you know make this country better that I can complain about the immigration system so uh we have a team member who is working she's also working at Salesforce uh she's working parttime at free Co Camp developing some courses and she you know studied in the US she's worked as a software engineer at Salesforce for like four years um actually it may not be four years but she's the four years that she's been here in the US she's applied to the H1B Lottery and she every single time she has not gotten it and this is absolutely the kind of like welleducated like highly compensated like expert that the US yeah and she's going to have to move to Canada if she doesn't win this time like there's like a limit in the number of times and Salesforce actually has like an entire like plan in place for uh employees who can't get an H1B Visa through the lottery uh despite spending you know tens of thousands of dollars and everything to try to get help them get that they have to move up to Vancouver from the San Francisco Bay area and they have to continue working from the Vancouver you know satellite so it's just one of those things it's like why does America shoot itself in the foot with this terrible immigration system but anyway I'm sorry I'll stop venting but but that is my magic that would be a great magic wand I would like to borrow that one that's one of the few things that like me as like a founder and like executive director which is basically the charity equivalent of a of a CEO like that's one thing that I feel completely powerless over uh I can change so much and like like we we work very hard to attract lots of women to work at free C Camp and and as I may have said earlier we're like nearly half women on our team both engineering and instructional and you know we're proud of that and yeah it takes a concertive effort to not only uh encourage women to join your team but to retain them over time because yeah uh it sounds like some of your cultural experiences I mean like when you look at culture like how much of it has come down to like they they do they have systematic bias against women at some of these organizations you worked at I don't want you to have to like Lobby specific lob specific accusations or anything but I left Amazon for a reason like and and luckily like with with some of the organizations sorry there's a big siren coming out outside so no worries we're in Chicago after all and it's a big city like a do you live in the BBS or I live in Chicago proper yeah oh wow yeah it's and it's great I just happen to live somewhat near a fire St so that's why we have some Sirens but anyway um luckily I think in a lot of my jobs it hasn't been too bad relatively speaking like like I I have no room to complain because people close to me have gone through so much worse that being said it exists there there's there's definitely systemic biases and very unkind people in the world who who let those biases the affect their decisions and and the words they say and the things that they do um and yeah when when I I'll just a a brief vignette when I was at Amazon like there was a point where I was for example supposed to run an event for a bunch of uh customers who were building on top of the echo devices I'm not saying her name because she's back there and she'll talk back okay um but anyway I was I was running inent it was a big deal like I was literally reporting certain findings to the s team which is the people who reports Jeff Bezos like it it was a big event and people weren't responding to my emails and I was like you need to submit your talks to me so I can put together this and and like make sure that these technical areas are covered and stuff people just wouldn't respond to me and I remember talking to my manager saying like hey do I need to build some clout here or something to so that way people respond he said oh it's cuz you're a woman we have a problem with that here like cool great well at least he acknowledge that it's a known issue but yeah do something about it what the heck so and like he he replied all to my group email to all of these people saying Hey give Cassidy the info they would say okay hey Dave here's the stuff like within an hour after me him they wouldn't add addressing him not me and like there were that that's like a very brief small minor thing but there was so much more that happened beyond that that like it it just it was miserable and and unfortunately like that was nothing compared to what some of the women on my team were going through there or my own sister was going through there yeah let's talk about your sister a little bit too she's somebody we I mean you've mentioned her a couple times but she followed very closely in your footsteps it sounds like or as you said before we met she followed in her own footsteps tell us a little bit about your sister footsteps yeah yeah and so my sister and I were were pretty close in age and we both majored in computer science that Iowa State um and uh we've worked together multiple times and then all and really diverged because we both like very different environments where um she and I both worked at clarify the startup and then we also both worked at Amazon together and uh I love startups she loves big companies so she she's kind of collected like The Infinity Gauntlet of big companies where she's worked at Apple Microsoft Google Amazon and now meta got to catch them all wow that's that's impressive like the entire Fang basically she's literally all the like she doesn't have Netflix but once she does she's done she she's made it but but yeah so she she must get a lot of recruiters reaching out to her my goodness I can only imagine and I hope I would like to think that her recruit like in recruiting like one of the big things the signal is where they already work because if they're good enough to work there there's a good chance they're good enough to work here like I can imagine she has a very easy time getting jobs if she does have a hard time getting jobs she's also just really good at what she does yeah and so and and it's fun cuz she and I work together really well like it's it's really fun to do things with her like when we were both at clarify we would sometimes give talks together um which was a blast because that people would approach us being like how long did you rehearse that your back and forth was amazing and we were just like we didn't we're related we've been practicing this for decades um and uh yeah and when we both worked at Amazon we did like a live stream for the echo showing people how to how to work with like buttons and stuff together and that was so fun too so we we really enjoy working together but we like very different work environments yeah where uh like my my mom says like I'm like the wild west cowboy and she's the one who's like an English writer where she prefers like a lot of structure big organization all that and I kind of just don't want anybody to bother me as I do what I want to to start that's so interesting that you all have very similar like I would imagine probably pretty similar upbringing both growing up in Chicago both studying at the same school both studying in the same field working at some of the same companies and yet it sounds like personality wise and certainly in terms of preferences for career You're So Different yeah yeah exactly and like there's a lot of similarities don't get me wrong like we both married software engineers and and uh do have a lot of similar hobbies and stuff but yeah she she and I are very different in what we like in terms of what makes us productive and everything and and we both are very interested in Dev advocacy and teaching and helping developers but she approaches from a I have a big company with all of these resources if I can like play the system well enough I can offer this many resources to people and with me I like the scrappy approach where it's just like what can I do to provide these resources to people and and the we we both have varying levels of success with different approaches stuff but it it works well for both of us yeah it sounds like it um I mean you both obviously have these story careers and it's so interesting to see like how you've diverg one thing that I would like to talk about because you talked about productivity and you also alluded earlier to burnout is you are somebody who is like you have a literal baby like I think he said is like nine months old yeah and you also are a CTO and you're also creating all this content pretty reliably uh on like all these different platforms like how do you avoid burnout when you're doing all those things and have you ever gotten close to burnout and since you were getting close and like been able to pull back before you go over the burnout Cliff so to speak and have to like climb your way all the way up the mountain again yeah I've really had to learn how to say no um I think my my two biggest burnout times where um one point at venmo I I was saying yes to everything because I was like if I do a lot of work now while I like am young and have energy it'll be good for me later in very yes but it was terrible for me healthwise where like there was a period where I spoke at an event for 14 days straight like including the weekends in addition to the 9 to5 job I I just I was doing way too much and I just burnt out so hard after that I like ran off to Florida to hang out with my grandpa after that that's wild 14 man how did you like get from event to event was it just like was it all in like the Bay Area or some kind of Cal it was mostly in New York City and then yeah there was there's I think there's a little bit of travel like by train at point I don't even remember all of them because it was a bad choice um anyway so that that was a big one and then um I'm not counting College I kind of burnt out at one point in college it was fine I almost went blind but then I went moved to Spain and I was fine um and then uh the next one was at NFI I was really close to burning out and again that's why I ended up leaving where I still loved that team and everything but I was just I I had to for my health I had to I had to go um and and I think yeah now I see the signs more where I'm just like oo I need to cut back on this or that and and I think a lot of burnout it doesn't come from doing a lot because kind of like you said I I tend to do a lot but it's more doing a lot that isn't aligned with your values yeah and that isn't aligned with what's important to you we like my Weekly Newsletter it's a lot of work because it's weekly and there's there's a lot to do with it and stuff and I manage sponsors and and all of the interview practice question responses and and various content things like that but it's something that's important to me it's something that I ultimately like doing and my like goal of helping developers it works towards that goal and so it it doesn't cause me to burn out um and if I were to do something that is not aligned with what matters to me where it's it's truly just like I know I can do this but it's it's a ton of work I think that's that's what would cause me to burn out more interesting so doing things that are not aligned with your values that don't feel like they're advancing what you care about advancing that seems to be uh a theme but like are there any signs you said that you kind of saw the signs yeah uh of burnout and like what are the signs people should be looking for not caring anymore I feel like I feel like that's probably the biggest the biggest sign red flag thing that you could see where where if you start to be like resigned to this is this is just how it is I just don't care anymore I'm just kind of going through the emotions that's the biggest one for me cuz though I don't think like work should be everything to you I don't think that it should be like the thing that you only care about it it's something that you it's something that you do for so much of your life you should care about it a little bit and uh if you simply just don't care anymore it's it's kind of like the the opposite of Love isn't hate it's indifference it's it's that kind of stuff where where if you if you truly are just I I can tell when I'm starting to get to a burnout point where like if I'm in a meeting or something I'm just like none of this matters I don't know why like like you you kind of just like start to feel that and and I feel like that's for me that's the biggest number one sign more than any like tiredness or or stress things yeah I'm just trying to think of like if you find yourself in that situation where you feel you're just getting more distant from the task at hand you're carrying less about the outcome of different things uh good news resonates less positively with you it doesn't really lay bad news you feel numb what um what can you do to like shake that up like obviously burnout you you finished College despite getting almost going blind you said yeah is there is that a long story or is just like long story short I took way too many courses because I knew I was going to be moving to Spain and I wasn't sleeping I was sleeping on average like between 1 and 3 hours a night at the most and yeah almost went blind don't do that kids like you went to the doctor and they said if you keep doing this you're going to lose your vision like what like how do it wasn't so much if you keep doing this it was one day I couldn't open my eyes and they were like I I remember I went to vacation with my family and I had to wear an eye patch the whole time because like I literally couldn't open one of my eyes anymore and like we were at like a literally like a doctor in a poblo and he was just like something's wrong with your eye like the whites of my eyes were gray and and like they were just my eyes were disintegrating anyway you should sleep that's the that's the conclusion there okay yeah sleep PSA Public Service Announcement please sleep everybody sleep eight hours if you can yeah but but to answer your question though about like what you can do um first of all lean on your community I've said that before I feel like the the first answer that a lot of people might shout is selfcare but if you shout selfcare at someone who could use a community um that that's that's doing a disservice to that person it's it's really important to have people around you who can kind of talk to you and and like kind of kind of give you a reality check and and and be there for you but then also on the selfcare front do things that you like and and just say no to certain things and be just like I need to step back from this or something and build a Lego set go travel and run off to Florida to see your grandpa like do do do something that that is very unrelated to work sometimes for me it's truly just like I'm going to just watch a K drama on Netflix I I I'm gonna do K my mom loves those they're so good but but yeah like like do do something that is like just for you to remind yourself I am a person Beyond this thing that I am not like doing and and sometimes like when I start approaching that moment I just do one of those things and I'm okay like a week later um and if it's something that's more prolonged and heavy that it's much harder to to fight against that but it's now acknowledged in multiple countries now that burnout is a real mental condition that that you need to fight against and you need to try to be proactive in leaning on the people that you care about be around people who care about you and do things that you care about yeah yeah I mean I I like to say that like you can accomplish so much in your life life is so long it's almost ridiculous how long life is and I say this as like a 43y old man who like can't believe that like if everything goes well I've got like a whole another 40 50 years to look forward to uh because it feels like life has been forever especially during the pandemic when time slowed down you can accomplish so much if you just don't burn out and just put forth like a consistent effort over time that's one of the things that really inspires me about you is you have kept going in terms of your newsletter for example you have kept going in terms of streaming in terms of creating these videos like you you you're not the kind of person who seems to get bored of something and just completely starts from fresh and like jumps from one fan flight of fantasy to the next like you're you're incredibly consistent over time and that's how I know that like I'm going to be excited to watch a cuz good things are are coming to you I want to talk about advice for people out there who may not feel that good things are coming to them and may not know how to get in the Rhythm like people that just got a CS degree and are having trouble uh applying for jobs people that are transitioning into Tech having difficulty applying for jobs there's like this kind of miasma in the air like oh Tech is dead like Developer jobs don't go there go go back to like culinary school or what real estate whatever kind of crap advice people are getting in my humble op like I don't want to B like don't go to culinary school I heard from so many chefs that like nobody goes to culinary school but like but yeah like like how do you counter that and how do you reassure people that no this The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow you know it's just a rainy day yeah and that's that's the thing I feel like a lot of new devs or people who haven't been through a few spells of the oh no Tech is dying the they're they're just like oh my gosh Tech really is dying I'm kind of just like it's died before it's but it keeps coming back there like we are in an increasingly digital world and Tech is going nowhere like sure we're going there's like waves of layoffs and stuff happening economies come and go but it's going to come back and you might as well be prepared for when it does and and I already like knock on wood who knows what's going on but uh it feels like it's already coming back uh like jobs wise and stuff I was talking to a friend yesterday where she was saying I don't know if I should quit my job she saw my tweet about like the three things that you should have in a role and she's like I have barely one of these I but like I'm afraid to apply and I said I think things are coming back and she messaged me like two hours later saying oh my gosh there's so many jobs what nobody's talking about how many people are hiring right now everybody's just talking about the layoffs don't listen to the the loud people shouting that the sky is falling like keep an eye out for good opportunities because there are so many uh you just have to know where to look and you also don't have to work at a very traditional tech company you don't have to work for like the microsofts and the apples you could work for a company like General Mills which is where one of my internships were food compan company lots of tasty breakfast cereal oh my gosh I had so many snacks there it was an amazing place to work I loved General Mills um but anyway like if I move to Minneapolis Sunday it's because I want to work there um there there's there's so many companies out there that can offer you good pay work life balance that aren't tech companies um they a good culture good good learning opportunities and and you just have to be willing to look where where one friend of mine uh was so burnt out by the tech industry he was just like I I feel like I need to quit software engineering but I like software engineering but I'm just tired of this environment and and he decided to just look into health and be like well where how can I help like doctors and stuff without actually having to become one and now he works for a health tech company where it's very separate from the shouting on Twitter and and like the the what is the next thing after react type conversations and he loves it where he's able to do these skills that he has but he's working at a company that's not Tech related he's just using his Tech skills and and the stat that I've always heard is like twothirds of Developer jobs are outside of what we traditionally consider Tech General Mills is not a tech company you know I would not argue that the car companies are tech companies or that Finance is Tech you know uh we we had a long conversation about this the other day uh I genuinely believe that uh if you're just looking at the big companies that are just doing these kind of layoffs like um a lot of which is like you know fast follower kind of like hey it's okay to lay people off CU you know this company just did so we're going to do it too right um and and a lot of employers will use like the the economy as an excuse for um just basically trying to have additional bargaining power over job candidates and things like that uh I love what you say don't listen to the loud people shouting that the sky is falling like don't listen to them the future is bright and one of the things that people shout a whole lot is AI is GNA take our gerbs right I mean what are your thoughts yeah it is but um like it's gonna improve but yeah I mean like that is probably the most common question I get uh every week I get dozens of emails I'm not exaggerating because I I send like 7 million emails my email list is really big and uh when people reply they're like hey is any of this even matter like aren't the AI just going to be able to do everything the developer can do and better like uh they have this kind of old John Henry kind of like driving spikes uh thing in their mind but that's not how software works and you know I I don't want to answer the question before I ask it but like what would you say to somebody who feels like they skills are going to be quickly outmoded by Ai and that in the future nobody's going to have a job and stuff like what would you say to them because I think my my pet theory is that it's very easy to procrastinate learning to code because it's such a big ambitious Endeavor and it's it's really good like copium if you will to to just say like well it doesn't matter if I learn to code anyway because the jobs aren't going to be there so therefore my decision to play video games yeah exactly like what do you think yeah Tech isn't good or Tech is going to keep going on and AI is probably not going to take your job AI is a really good tool and I feel like you can use it as such where like I'm sure when someone invented the crane there are a bunch of construction workers saying like oh no what are we going to do this big heavy thing is going to lift a big heavy thing and and I won't lift a big heavy thing now they're just using that tool to help lift the big heavy things kind of like when Alpha go came out uh I play Go daily I love playing go it's like that grid with the black and white pieces and back in like very accurate portrayal in that uh Knives Out movie yeah that was that was so fun I made a Kickstarter for go back in the day and used a clip from it but anyway um it's it's such a fun game this Alpha go bot like beat out so many different players but that doesn't mean that people stop playing go it's it's still such a fun and interesting game and now Alpha go is great at teaching you moves there are some moves that professionals were just like this is the correct move in this scenario for hundreds of years and then alphago changed that for the first time and people were just like wait we just never saw that you can use these tools to unlock different ways of thinking and different ways of being productive where I think like GitHub copilot is a really good example where it is a copilot it's a thing that can help you write things it's not always going to be right you are ultimately in the driver's seat building something but it can help you where like I don't need to write yet another sorting function or I don't need to write yet another hello world react component that I can just add stuff to I can I can do that and you can let it be a tool that you use to get your ideas across and be more productive on things it doesn't have to be this thing that's it's just going to take your job and I don't think it's going to take your job for a while cuz some of the codes where I've been just like oh AI wrote this for me amazing has been so bad or later I'm just like wait why did I listen to the AI llms large language models are very good at predicting what the next word should look like but that doesn't mean it's the right word and they are so bad at math and I use math as an example because math is a very precise thing if you have it do like a demo function for something a lot of the answers are going to be wrong because it's not actually executing code it's not actually doing the logic just does what it thinks the logic should look like and so anyway all that being said yes it's getting better and better but that just means that you can use it to solve more interesting problems 100% agreed use AI as a tool don't use it as an excuse not to learn ma math programming computer science you should still learn these skills and um I hope that you know people will follow you and watch many of your amazing videos maybe even join your patreon community because it sounds like Community is like a big deal in cat City Williams land and the fact that you've had that Community there you've you've helped Yourself by having that community and other people in your community are helping one another um Community selfcare is no substitute for having other people who have your back and having that feeling that you're part of a tribe and you can help other people and they'll help you that General Vibe of reciprocation so I've learned so much from this conversation with you and I'm going to encourage everybody to check out the show notes below where I've included lots of links to interesting stuff about Cassidy uh and I I just want to thank you for your time because you know you're a busy mom CTO you're doing all these things and I feel very grateful that you've taken the time to come on the free code Camp podcast thank you so much for having me it was a really fun time well everybody until next week happy coding bye
