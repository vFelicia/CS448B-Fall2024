00:00 - hi it's brianna from free code camp
00:02 - today we're going to be talking about
00:04 - data size the smallest size of data you
00:07 - can possibly have is called a bit now
00:11 - that is i wrote a one here that's an
00:13 - example of a bit it can really either
00:15 - only be a one or a zero it really goes
00:18 - back to that binary that we were talking
00:20 - about one meaning on zero meaning off it
00:22 - can either be a one or a zero that's a
00:24 - bit
00:25 - bigger than that we've got a nibble
00:26 - which is four bits it's not very
00:28 - commonly used but it's adorable um
00:31 - bigger than that we've got a byte now
00:32 - this is common referring to something in
00:34 - a byte it is eight bits put together now
00:37 - a lot of binary things are expressed
00:39 - with eight bits like letters and symbols
00:42 - and well most numbers really can be
00:44 - expressed that way until you get to
00:45 - really big ones
00:47 - so our most basic data sizes we've got a
00:49 - bit
00:50 - and a byte but as you can guess it gets
00:52 - much bigger than that alright so after
00:55 - we get past the regular small bit and
00:57 - the first little bite which is eight
00:59 - bits we get bigger really fast the next
01:02 - step up is a kilobyte which is
01:05 - 1024 bytes which times eight is a whole
01:08 - lot more bits
01:10 - after the kilobyte we've got megabyte
01:11 - which is 1024 to the power of two which
01:15 - is the same thing as one million forty
01:17 - eight thousand five hundred and seventy
01:19 - six bytes so
01:21 - since we're growing exponentially that
01:23 - is a big big increase after megabyte
01:26 - we've got gigabyte also known as gb
01:29 - which is 1024 to the power of three then
01:31 - tb terabyte 1024 to the power 4 and pd
01:36 - not peanut butter it is petabyte 1024 to
01:39 - the power of five just to give you an
01:42 - idea of how big this number is if you
01:43 - can't see it i almost ran out of room
01:46 - writing this on my whiteboard these are
01:49 - some pretty big numbers we're dealing
01:50 - with here
01:52 - you probably recognize megabyte gigabyte
01:54 - terabyte from regular storage that
01:56 - you've dealt with before on your ipad
01:59 - your ipod your computer anything like
02:01 - that
02:03 - all right just a quick review
02:05 - bit tiny little either one or zero bite
02:09 - eight bits kilobyte 1024
02:12 - bytes
02:13 - after that everything is an exponent off
02:16 - of 1024 going from kilobyte to megabyte
02:19 - to gigabyte to terabyte all the way up
02:21 - to a petabyte
