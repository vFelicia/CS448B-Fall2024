00:00 - what's the difference between cookies
00:02 - local storage and session storage well
00:05 - there are all ways to store data in the
00:07 - browser itself for use later I'm going
00:10 - to talk about their differences and then
00:12 - show how to use them in JavaScript so if
00:14 - you look at this chart here you can see
00:16 - they all have different capacities
00:18 - cookies Can Only Store 4 kilobytes of
00:21 - data which is much smaller than local
00:23 - storage and session storage with 10
00:25 - megabytes and 5 megabytes and cookies
00:28 - are are compatible with much older
00:30 - browsers cookies are compatible with
00:33 - browsers that have used HTML 4 and 5 and
00:36 - local storage and session storage are
00:38 - only compatible with newer browsers that
00:40 - use HTML 5 cookies are accessible from
00:43 - any window same with local storage
00:45 - session storage are is only accessible
00:48 - from the same tab that was created in
00:51 - and then the expiration date is
00:52 - different um cookies you have to
00:54 - manually set the expiration date local
00:56 - storage never expires until you use
01:00 - JavaScript to clear it or if the user
01:02 - clears it and session storage uh expires
01:06 - on Tab close cuz it's it's just for the
01:09 - session that the user is on now just you
01:12 - know local storage and session storage
01:14 - are actually pretty similar um just that
01:17 - local storages last forever and then
01:19 - session storage expires on Tab close and
01:23 - cookies are the are the one that's a
01:25 - little different but these last two are
01:27 - the things that are really the most
01:29 - different between cookies and local
01:32 - storage and session storage uh cookies
01:34 - are stored on the browser and server
01:38 - while local storage and session storage
01:41 - are only stored in the
01:43 - browser and the interesting thing about
01:45 - cookies is that they are sent to the
01:48 - server on every request whenever you
01:52 - load an image whenever you load a CSS
01:54 - file or a new HTML file the cookie
01:57 - information is sent to the the server
02:01 - however local storage and session
02:03 - storage it's never sent to the the
02:05 - server so basically cookies are best for
02:08 - data and anything that has to be
02:09 - accessed by the server and the local
02:12 - machine or or anything you want to set
02:14 - an expiration date on local storage is
02:17 - best for basically everything else
02:19 - cookies are often used for things such
02:21 - as authentication information that you
02:23 - have to regularly be sending back and
02:25 - forth but for most use cases you're
02:29 - going to want to use local storage or
02:30 - session storage as long as you're pretty
02:33 - sure all your users will have browsers
02:35 - that use HTML 5 but let's see how to use
02:38 - all of them in JavaScript so if we see
02:41 - the code over here uh it just says local
02:44 - storage. set item and then these are all
02:47 - key value pairs so the key is breakfast
02:49 - the value is serial so we can also get
02:52 - the item so we're going to
02:55 - do okay we're going to we're going to
02:57 - console.log that and let's open up the
03:01 - browser's log okay look at the bottom
03:04 - here and we see Cal we just set this
03:07 - local storage item and then we
03:09 - console.log and we got the item
03:12 - breakfast is cereal but I also open up
03:15 - this here so you can see where in Chrome
03:18 - you can actually see all the local
03:20 - storage items and you can see all the
03:21 - cookies right in here you can see the
03:23 - key and the value right here key is
03:25 - breakfast value is cereal here are the
03:28 - different websites they have local store
03:29 - storage that we're on so you can see you
03:32 - can go back and forth between these two
03:33 - we're on s. codepen.io but if you're on
03:36 - a different website it will show that
03:37 - website there and for um for session
03:40 - storage it's basically you do it just
03:42 - like local storage instead of local
03:44 - storage. set item you type session
03:47 - storage. set item so for instance we
03:49 - could actually change this session
03:52 - storage and we can change this to
03:53 - session storage and then if I run that I
03:56 - can go down to session storage over here
04:00 - and you'll see the breakfast cereal
04:01 - there too but let's say um for session
04:05 - storage we're going to have
04:07 - eggs and you can see it changed the
04:09 - value up here so we still have the the
04:12 - local storage as seral and the session
04:15 - storage as eggs another thing you can do
04:18 - um if I change this to uh dinner so
04:21 - we're going to have eggs for dinner and
04:23 - run that oh and then I go back to the
04:25 - session storage over here uh you can see
04:28 - that in the program we only set the item
04:31 - dinner for eggs but now we have
04:33 - breakfast eggs and dinner eggs because
04:37 - it it didn't clear the session storage
04:38 - even though it's not showing in our in
04:40 - our program
04:43 - anymore now we're going to change this
04:45 - back to local go here and actually I
04:48 - want to have for lunch I also want to
04:52 - have
04:54 - cereal and if we run that you'll see
04:58 - breakfast cereal and launch cereal but
05:01 - if you ever change the value it's not
05:03 - going to add a new one it only adds a
05:05 - new one if you change the key okay now
05:07 - here's how you would remove an
05:10 - item okay so if I run
05:13 - this you'll see launch is now gone from
05:16 - the the local storage here and then if
05:19 - you ever just want to remove all the
05:21 - items you just do local storage. CLE I
05:25 - run that and now everything is gone
05:28 - we've cleared all the items
05:30 - so let's go over cookies really quick so
05:33 - here you're going to say
05:35 - document.cookie
05:40 - okay and with cookies you also pass in a
05:42 - key value pair so I went to the cookie
05:45 - section on the the application Dev tools
05:48 - uh and just so you know if you can't
05:50 - figure out what section the cookies and
05:52 - the session and the local storage are in
05:54 - you're going to go to um the application
05:57 - tab here so the application tab is what
06:00 - going to show all this so if I run this
06:03 - and then if I just refresh this down
06:06 - here you will see we have a cookie now
06:07 - we have this one that's just created
06:09 - automatically but we have this cookie
06:11 - let's move this over so we can see this
06:13 - a little better the name is hello the
06:15 - value is true you can see the domain
06:18 - that it's on and then the path and then
06:22 - cookies have expiration dates so this is
06:25 - if you don't set an expiration date I
06:27 - didn't set an expiration dat date here
06:29 - it's going to just be expire when the
06:32 - session is over okay here I just created
06:36 - another cookie but I am going to have an
06:38 - expiration date so the cookie do
06:41 - something only once equals true and then
06:44 - expires equals and then you have to put
06:46 - a date here so if I run
06:50 - that and then refresh the cookies down
06:52 - here you'll see do something only once
06:54 - equals true and now you'll see that
06:56 - there is an expiration date now so so
06:59 - you can set that to anything of when you
07:00 - want the cookie to expire which will
07:03 - make it just automatically delete okay
07:06 - now here's another cookie here and here
07:09 - we're going to have the expiration date
07:11 - and then I'm going to have one more
07:12 - parameter which is the path so here the
07:15 - path was just being set automatically
07:17 - but now um we can put what path we want
07:20 - it at and now it's just going to be the
07:22 - root path and the path is just which uh
07:26 - which path on your website the cookie
07:28 - associated with so if you just want to
07:31 - associated with certain folders on your
07:34 - website you can do that and another
07:36 - thing I want to show you is if you want
07:37 - to get a cookie you can do
07:40 - console.log uh
07:42 - document.cookie so I'm going to just
07:45 - going to console. log. document.cookie
07:47 - and if we run that if you look down here
07:50 - at the console hello equals true do
07:52 - something once equals true person equals
07:54 - true you cannot get one cookie at a time
07:59 - all the cookies basically get stored on
08:01 - in one string file so when you get your
08:05 - the cookies you get them all at once and
08:07 - then you would have to have extra code
08:10 - to parse out exactly what cookie you
08:12 - want to use if there's only one that you
08:15 - want to use for that that use case okay
08:17 - and the last thing I want to show you is
08:19 - how to delete a cookie so to delete a
08:22 - cookie you just set the cookie to have a
08:25 - an expired expiration date so um right
08:30 - here I I pass in person equals and it's
08:33 - not going to be before it's person
08:35 - equals bow and now we're just doing
08:36 - person equals because we don't want it
08:38 - to equal anything and then we put an
08:40 - expiration date that's already expired
08:42 - and then you have to make sure to use
08:44 - the exact same path so we see it right
08:47 - here person equals bow but if we run
08:50 - that and then if I refresh this you can
08:53 - see now it's completely gone it's been
08:56 - deleted okay well thanks for watching my

what's the difference between cookies local storage and session storage well there are all ways to store data in the browser itself for use later I'm going to talk about their differences and then show how to use them in JavaScript so if you look at this chart here you can see they all have different capacities cookies Can Only Store 4 kilobytes of data which is much smaller than local storage and session storage with 10 megabytes and 5 megabytes and cookies are are compatible with much older browsers cookies are compatible with browsers that have used HTML 4 and 5 and local storage and session storage are only compatible with newer browsers that use HTML 5 cookies are accessible from any window same with local storage session storage are is only accessible from the same tab that was created in and then the expiration date is different um cookies you have to manually set the expiration date local storage never expires until you use JavaScript to clear it or if the user clears it and session storage uh expires on Tab close cuz it's it's just for the session that the user is on now just you know local storage and session storage are actually pretty similar um just that local storages last forever and then session storage expires on Tab close and cookies are the are the one that's a little different but these last two are the things that are really the most different between cookies and local storage and session storage uh cookies are stored on the browser and server while local storage and session storage are only stored in the browser and the interesting thing about cookies is that they are sent to the server on every request whenever you load an image whenever you load a CSS file or a new HTML file the cookie information is sent to the the server however local storage and session storage it's never sent to the the server so basically cookies are best for data and anything that has to be accessed by the server and the local machine or or anything you want to set an expiration date on local storage is best for basically everything else cookies are often used for things such as authentication information that you have to regularly be sending back and forth but for most use cases you're going to want to use local storage or session storage as long as you're pretty sure all your users will have browsers that use HTML 5 but let's see how to use all of them in JavaScript so if we see the code over here uh it just says local storage. set item and then these are all key value pairs so the key is breakfast the value is serial so we can also get the item so we're going to do okay we're going to we're going to console.log that and let's open up the browser's log okay look at the bottom here and we see Cal we just set this local storage item and then we console.log and we got the item breakfast is cereal but I also open up this here so you can see where in Chrome you can actually see all the local storage items and you can see all the cookies right in here you can see the key and the value right here key is breakfast value is cereal here are the different websites they have local store storage that we're on so you can see you can go back and forth between these two we're on s. codepen.io but if you're on a different website it will show that website there and for um for session storage it's basically you do it just like local storage instead of local storage. set item you type session storage. set item so for instance we could actually change this session storage and we can change this to session storage and then if I run that I can go down to session storage over here and you'll see the breakfast cereal there too but let's say um for session storage we're going to have eggs and you can see it changed the value up here so we still have the the local storage as seral and the session storage as eggs another thing you can do um if I change this to uh dinner so we're going to have eggs for dinner and run that oh and then I go back to the session storage over here uh you can see that in the program we only set the item dinner for eggs but now we have breakfast eggs and dinner eggs because it it didn't clear the session storage even though it's not showing in our in our program anymore now we're going to change this back to local go here and actually I want to have for lunch I also want to have cereal and if we run that you'll see breakfast cereal and launch cereal but if you ever change the value it's not going to add a new one it only adds a new one if you change the key okay now here's how you would remove an item okay so if I run this you'll see launch is now gone from the the local storage here and then if you ever just want to remove all the items you just do local storage. CLE I run that and now everything is gone we've cleared all the items so let's go over cookies really quick so here you're going to say document.cookie okay and with cookies you also pass in a key value pair so I went to the cookie section on the the application Dev tools uh and just so you know if you can't figure out what section the cookies and the session and the local storage are in you're going to go to um the application tab here so the application tab is what going to show all this so if I run this and then if I just refresh this down here you will see we have a cookie now we have this one that's just created automatically but we have this cookie let's move this over so we can see this a little better the name is hello the value is true you can see the domain that it's on and then the path and then cookies have expiration dates so this is if you don't set an expiration date I didn't set an expiration dat date here it's going to just be expire when the session is over okay here I just created another cookie but I am going to have an expiration date so the cookie do something only once equals true and then expires equals and then you have to put a date here so if I run that and then refresh the cookies down here you'll see do something only once equals true and now you'll see that there is an expiration date now so so you can set that to anything of when you want the cookie to expire which will make it just automatically delete okay now here's another cookie here and here we're going to have the expiration date and then I'm going to have one more parameter which is the path so here the path was just being set automatically but now um we can put what path we want it at and now it's just going to be the root path and the path is just which uh which path on your website the cookie associated with so if you just want to associated with certain folders on your website you can do that and another thing I want to show you is if you want to get a cookie you can do console.log uh document.cookie so I'm going to just going to console. log. document.cookie and if we run that if you look down here at the console hello equals true do something once equals true person equals true you cannot get one cookie at a time all the cookies basically get stored on in one string file so when you get your the cookies you get them all at once and then you would have to have extra code to parse out exactly what cookie you want to use if there's only one that you want to use for that that use case okay and the last thing I want to show you is how to delete a cookie so to delete a cookie you just set the cookie to have a an expired expiration date so um right here I I pass in person equals and it's not going to be before it's person equals bow and now we're just doing person equals because we don't want it to equal anything and then we put an expiration date that's already expired and then you have to make sure to use the exact same path so we see it right here person equals bow but if we run that and then if I refresh this you can see now it's completely gone it's been deleted okay well thanks for watching my name is Bo KS don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
