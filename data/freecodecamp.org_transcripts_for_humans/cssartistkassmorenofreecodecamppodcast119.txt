02:29 - right and here we are on CSS artist.com
02:33 - and can yeah go ahead and talk talk us
02:37 - through what you're doing okay yeah so
02:40 - this is my portfolio website I wanted to
02:43 - make sure that it was a little bit weird
02:44 - a little bit um different uh so I have
02:49 - most of my CSS art on here but the one
02:51 - that I'm like most proud of I think is
02:53 - super cool is the um I made the
02:55 - scrolling animation for the uh photo
02:58 - realistic Polaroid drawing that I made
03:01 - using CSS and HTML so it's basically as
03:05 - you scroll you see how the um how the
03:08 - drawing is getting built so you see like
03:11 - the two boxes then you you know more
03:14 - like shading comes in you see
03:16 - Flash the um the lens so you kind of get
03:21 - to see the progression of it uh that's
03:23 - probably my favorite CSS art ever yeah
03:27 - and it's so cool if you scroll down just
03:28 - so we can see the finished product like
03:30 - the the actual like gloss to it the
03:33 - sheen I mean it looks so delicious for
03:36 - lack of a better word it looks like uh
03:38 - almost like a cake matte finish like
03:41 - that that shininess and then of course
03:43 - the iconic Polaroid slot where you pull
03:45 - your your photo out after you've taken
03:48 - the photo everything looks so photo
03:50 - realistic like the uh the glare on the
03:53 - lens for example the the the glass that
03:56 - covers like that aperture that takes the
03:58 - photo yeah yeah everything and the
04:00 - viewfinder I mean so photo realistic and
04:04 - so cool I love it thank you yeah yeah
04:07 - the um it's those little details that
04:10 - you have to spend so much time looking
04:12 - at and they seem so insignificant at
04:15 - first until you like take a step back
04:16 - and look at the whole thing you're like
04:18 - okay no that was definitely worth it to
04:19 - do yeah yeah let's take a look at some
04:22 - of your other work too so if you scroll
04:24 - down on her page you just get like this
04:28 - amazing grid of
04:30 - photorealistic CSS uh art like uh for
04:35 - example maybe we could click on uh that
04:38 - crayon
04:39 - box uh yeah this is one of the first
04:42 - ones that I did and I believe if I'm not
04:44 - mistaken it's a single div wow so the
04:47 - HTML is just
04:49 - div and everything inside is just
04:52 - backgrounds is it like absolutely
04:54 - positioned or like how how do you do
04:56 - that yeah this one's just absolutely
04:58 - positioned with a sing background and uh
05:02 - it's just Stacks linear
05:04 - gradients yeah and it looks like a photo
05:07 - realistic Crayola box without the
05:08 - Crayola logo it's got that those iconic
05:11 - kind of green and yellow box and like
05:14 - the shadow underneath it and like the
05:17 - the some of the colors have like this
05:19 - matte finish to them to them some are a
05:21 - little bit shiny so
05:23 - beautiful yeah thank you yeah this one
05:25 - was I think one of the first ones that I
05:27 - that I really did as soon as you learn
05:29 - how to stack the gradients with the
05:30 - single div like you're Off to the Races
05:33 - yeah let's take a look at that
05:35 - calculator okay yeah this one was
05:38 - probably the hardest one I've ever done
05:40 - easily probably yeah yeah yeah the
05:43 - buttons the buttons oh my gosh those
05:45 - took
05:46 - forever yeah they just have this
05:49 - concaveness like this concavity whatever
05:51 - the word is like you can almost feel
05:53 - like your fingertip kind of like resting
05:56 - on top of it and like the ergonomic of
05:58 - it and then just pressing it in and
06:00 - feeling that that tactile click uh you
06:03 - can imagine like you're just working
06:04 - really fast like kind of a tanky type
06:06 - thing so cool and it it's got kind of
06:09 - that iconic like orange and gray look uh
06:12 - orange and gray I don't know what it is
06:13 - about them like the NES zapper gun like
06:16 - has that like at least in the US it had
06:18 - that orange and gray look so cool
06:20 - looking yeah like nostalgic oh yeah that
06:24 - off white casing that they used to
06:26 - always put Electronics on in yeah yeah
06:29 - so cool and there's a ton of CSS here
06:31 - how many lines of CSS is this this one
06:34 - is oh it's still loading
06:39 - 1,143
06:41 - lines yeah so it's a lot and it it was
06:45 - the buttons the buttons they look like
06:46 - you could just copy and paste them but
06:49 - they each need to have their own
06:50 - separate like kind of shading and
06:53 - gradience on it um otherwise it just it
06:56 - just didn't look it just didn't look
06:58 - right so yeah that's took forever and
07:00 - that's pretty much what all of the CSS
07:02 - is I mean like that attention to detail
07:04 - thinking like even though this button is
07:06 - only like you know 5 mm to the right of
07:09 - this one it's going to be hit by the
07:11 - Light slightly differently right like
07:13 - the Shadows look slight long yeah yeah
07:17 - yeah so if you look from the buttons
07:18 - like they're just slightly different not
07:21 - too different just slightly
07:23 - different amazing and that game boy
07:26 - let's check out that that that game game
07:28 - boy so nice this is like one of the
07:30 - second generation game boys I think cuz
07:33 - it's like a little bit less boxy yeah
07:36 - yeah yeah this one um oh my gosh I loved
07:39 - Game Boy I used to play like Pokemon all
07:41 - the time on especially like on trips and
07:43 - stuff so this one was super fun to do I
07:46 - loved doing the shading inside of the
07:47 - screen so it looks like it's kind of
07:49 - inset how the game boys actually
07:51 - look I don't know why I thought that was
07:53 - so cool looking and the shading on the
07:56 - on the arrows and the buttons love that
07:58 - too yeah it's super fun to do amazing
08:02 - again anybody listening to the audio
08:03 - version CSS artist.com you can check all
08:06 - these out um these are so cool all right
08:10 - well let's talk about the woman behind
08:13 - the art C Mareno like let's dive
08:17 - into how you got to this level with your
08:21 - CSS skills and uh maybe what I like to
08:25 - do is I like to start at the very
08:26 - beginning as far back as we can go maybe
08:29 - you could talk a little bit about your
08:31 - early days um and um I understand that
08:35 - you were born in Mexico and that you
08:37 - moved to the us when you were six yeah
08:39 - yeah well I was actually I'm I was born
08:41 - in the US uh but I lived in Mexico um
08:46 - until I was six and then I moved back to
08:48 - the US to San Antonio Texas because my
08:52 - parents started a business so um from
08:54 - there you know English became my main
08:57 - language and uh yeah so I ended up just
09:00 - growing up here uh went to high school I
09:03 - was not a great high school student um
09:07 - skipped a lot all of that good stuff all
09:09 - of the fun stuff but uh at the end I
09:13 - decided that I wanted to go to school
09:15 - for architecture yes so um yeah I did
09:19 - that for three whole years and it was so
09:22 - intense like I remember the first day in
09:24 - class like they sit you down in studio
09:26 - and you get there and you're like you
09:28 - know super excited to be here and the
09:29 - teacher like I hope you don't have a
09:31 - boyfriend and I hope you don't have
09:32 - another job because this is going to be
09:34 - your life from now on and I'm just like
09:36 - oh my gosh what did I do yeah yeah so I
09:42 - did that for three years until I was
09:44 - like the thought it it was fun it was uh
09:48 - it taught me a lot like um that's that
09:50 - school was a lot it was uh wow sorry it
09:55 - really pushed a lot of like Hands-On
09:57 - work instead of computer work for
09:59 - architecture so like at the beginning we
10:01 - did a lot of like art projects um
10:04 - learning like art Theory and all of that
10:06 - photorealistic drawings and stuff which
10:08 - I love but the thought of having to do
10:11 - that and like doing architecture for the
10:12 - rest of my life was uh it just it didn't
10:15 - sound like something I want to do so
10:18 - yeah it's a it's a difficult decision
10:20 - but year three almost done I decided
10:23 - that this was not for me like at all I
10:25 - couldn't wasn't like like can you
10:29 - remember what that that moment of you
10:32 - know Revelation maybe it wasn't maybe it
10:33 - was a gradual sinking feeling but like
10:36 - when you finally decided no I'm really
10:38 - not going to do this I'm not going to
10:39 - spend my life being an architect uh like
10:43 - what did you do at that point uh yeah it
10:46 - was it was gradual you like you start
10:48 - getting less excited to go to class you
10:50 - start getting less excited to learn like
10:52 - you don't really want to do the projects
10:53 - anymore and you know it's uh it finally
10:58 - just kind of clicks one day that like my
10:59 - grades were falling it was it was
11:01 - showing everywhere that I just didn't
11:03 - want to do that anymore so I finally was
11:05 - just like okay no like I need to Pivot
11:08 - it's probably not the best idea I may be
11:12 - making the wrong choice but I feel it
11:13 - like in my heart that like this isn't
11:15 - what I'm going to do forever is going to
11:18 - make me happy you make that decision
11:20 - what do you
11:21 - do call my mom all right call my mom and
11:26 - tell her uh and you know try to be real
11:29 - nice about it because she's paying for
11:31 - school and everything and um thankfully
11:34 - she's very kind and she said you know
11:36 - that's fine you have to do something
11:38 - though so like figure something out get
11:40 - a job at least like we'll go from there
11:43 - so yeah thankfully like my mom was super
11:46 - cool about it and she let me just
11:48 - like no harm no foul like it happens you
11:52 - know just be happy so I I did I ended up
11:55 - getting a job at Sprint I didn't know
11:57 - what I was going to do so I just started
12:00 - working which is where I also found out
12:02 - I really didn't want to be a salesperson
12:04 - yeah Sprint is for for anybody outside
12:07 - the US Sprint is a like cell phone
12:10 - carrier uh it's like one of the big they
12:13 - were did they they were they got bought
12:15 - by T-Mobile oh okay yeah so yeah you
12:18 - used to like was were there the ones
12:20 - with like so quiet like you can hear a
12:22 - pin drop was that their commercial uh no
12:24 - I think I'm not sure actually but there
12:27 - was like there were like some really
12:28 - interesting like 1980s 1990s nothing was
12:31 - more 80s than you know cell phone
12:34 - carrier commercial or 90s I guess
12:35 - because cell phones were pretty can you
12:36 - hear me in the 90s yeah exactly yeah
12:39 - they had like the big can you hear me
12:40 - now I'm walking around like the entire
12:42 - us to check the coverage yeah uh so so
12:46 - you were you decided you didn't want to
12:48 - do sales like but you spent like two
12:49 - years working in it yeah yeah um but it
12:53 - was I was not good at it I was probably
12:55 - the worst sales person I don't it's
12:58 - really hard for me to try to tell
12:59 - someone that they need this like $40
13:01 - charger when you don't really need the
13:02 - $40 charger let's be real so no I'm not
13:06 - a sales person at all never put me in
13:08 - any sales position because I'm just
13:11 - going to agree with the customer on
13:13 - everything and be like n you don't
13:14 - really need it yeah wow you're you're
13:16 - too empathetic you're too nice to be a
13:18 - salesperson maybe yes that's that's
13:20 - that's my problem I'm too nice
13:24 - so you know we jump straight to college
13:26 - but I I do want to talk a little bit
13:28 - about uh your early days because you you
13:30 - said you were born in San
13:32 - Antonio uh I was born in Laredo Laredo
13:35 - okay that's here in Texas too sorry I'm
13:37 - like not a native yeah that's Texas so
13:41 - it was kind of funny because I was born
13:42 - in Laro but I lived in noo which is
13:45 - Mexico and um so I would actually I went
13:50 - to school in the US too though so I
13:52 - would like drive across the border every
13:55 - day for elementary for like Kinder in
13:57 - elementary school
13:59 - um so that was
14:02 - interesting uh but yeah I did that until
14:04 - I was six and then we moved to the US
14:06 - okay yeah so you already had some
14:08 - English skills and
14:11 - uh you you told me earlier before we
14:13 - started recording like your sister was
14:15 - really big on English and and she was an
14:18 - inspiration for you to really like bulk
14:19 - up on your English skills yeah yeah well
14:22 - because actually most of the people in
14:24 - my school just spoke Spanish even though
14:25 - it's in the US it was predominantly just
14:28 - Spanish and Mexican people so um we
14:31 - didn't really speak any English but my
14:33 - sister was learning it and I remember
14:35 - she was like kind of talking it with her
14:37 - friends and everything and I'm like you
14:39 - know I want to talk that like I want to
14:41 - speak English too like what and so
14:44 - that's what got me to learn just being
14:46 - like that annoying little sister of like
14:48 - I want to do what you're
14:50 - doing yeah so obviously that worked out
14:55 - really well for you because I mean you
14:56 - sound like a native speaker of of course
14:58 - starting early what about the rest of
15:00 - you uh like uh and so you have an older
15:04 - sister and you have a brother as well
15:06 - yeah yeah I have an older sister I have
15:08 - a younger brother so I'm the middle
15:10 - child and then I have two half sisters
15:13 - um they're both in college right now
15:15 - okay cool
15:17 - and what did your brother and sister
15:20 - like ultimately decide to do I'm just
15:21 - curious what we're talking about them
15:23 - like uh yeah are they they are they here
15:28 - in Texas still yeah yeah so my brother
15:31 - went to UT um then back home yeah
15:36 - University of Texas um he studied
15:39 - business there and so now he's working
15:41 - in my parents' business and so is my
15:43 - sister so it's like a whole family
15:45 - business and they're all working except
15:46 - for me okay cool and yeah so so I'm
15:51 - really excited to talk about your
15:53 - relationship with your mom I know that
15:54 - sounds weird to say but like she my
15:57 - understanding is she was absolutely
15:59 - vital to helping you like launch your uh
16:04 - career as a software developer yeah you
16:07 - could talk about like how that came
16:09 - about yeah so I mean one thing to know
16:12 - my mom is a saint okay like uh she let
16:15 - me kind of flail around and try to
16:17 - figure out what I want to do with my
16:18 - life which is not something that a lot
16:20 - of people get a chance to do like they
16:22 - don't you know she's she's very patient
16:24 - with me um but yeah it was towards the
16:28 - end of my
16:29 - my non-successful tenure at Sprint that
16:33 - she was like hey I need a website for
16:35 - the business I need a new one because
16:37 - theirs was super old she's like you're
16:39 - not doing anything right so like why
16:41 - don't you try to figure this out and she
16:44 - was right I wasn't so I'm like okay yeah
16:46 - that actually sounds like something fun
16:48 - like something I could just dive into
16:50 - and um from there yeah I started reading
16:54 - about WordPress cuz that's what her site
16:56 - was on and then I started like okay so
16:58 - then I need theme okay what's the most
17:00 - popular theme cool so how do I change
17:02 - this header like and then it just
17:04 - snowballed into like oh okay so I should
17:07 - probably like look at this course and
17:08 - then like oh free code camp and then
17:10 - like oh you D me and it just never ended
17:13 - and yeah it was just quite the quite the
17:16 - beginning right it just snowballs once
17:18 - you start you just keep getting more
17:19 - curious about everything
17:21 - else yeah and maybe you can talk about
17:24 - like that process of building that
17:26 - project WordPress of course being this
17:28 - giant ecosystem of plugins and templates
17:31 - and things like that like how did you
17:33 - start out what was the what was the
17:34 - first uh because this is really cool
17:37 - it's like project oriented learning you
17:38 - already have a stakeholder right your
17:41 - mom and yeah of course nobody wants to
17:43 - disappoint their mom so you're probably
17:45 - working really hard to get this done
17:47 - well yeah yeah after dropping out of
17:49 - college and leaving Sprint I definitely
17:51 - needed this to be like a thing that
17:53 - she's like oh thank you like you know I
17:55 - wanted to help her at this point because
17:57 - she's helped me so much so yeah I spent
18:00 - a lot of time on this trying to make
18:01 - sure it's perfect like I found the you
18:04 - know the perfect theme and then I joined
18:07 - the theme groups but that wasn't enough
18:09 - because like what if I want to change
18:11 - something very specifically and like
18:13 - look at all of these other cool sites I
18:14 - want to do what they do like so um I
18:18 - started taking CSS courses and then I'm
18:20 - like oh but if I want to do this you
18:22 - need to learn JavaScript what's that oh
18:24 - my gosh that looks really difficult um
18:27 - and so yeah you just kind of start with
18:29 - that
18:30 - and so the process was just yeah
18:33 - iterations and iterations of just
18:34 - getting better and like I'd be I
18:37 - remember just being at home at night
18:38 - next to my well now husband and just
18:40 - being like look babe I I changed the
18:42 - header to this website like the color
18:44 - was black and now it's red like I was so
18:47 - excited and he was like there just like
18:48 - yeah that's so cool and so then I would
18:50 - show my mom like and so yeah it's we
18:53 - just kept iterating where I would like
18:54 - you know compare their websites see what
18:56 - they do like what is my mom trying to do
18:58 - like it just it was a lot of learning
19:00 - like like you said project oriented
19:02 - learning is incredible because you
19:04 - already you're not like lost you you
19:06 - have like a clear set of things that you
19:08 - need to get done and you just kind of
19:10 - you just jump right in yeah and so you
19:14 - eventually build this this website for
19:17 - your mom is is it still live today is it
19:19 - is it a WordPress no no yeah that was a
19:22 - while ago they already took that one
19:23 - down okay but I mean nothing lasts
19:26 - forever in on on the web as Mark Mark
19:30 - Zuckerberg says like you know when uh
19:34 - you know you can find like ancient ruins
19:36 - of like past civilizations but on the
19:38 - web nothing is left it's just like yeah
19:41 - it's as though nothing were even there
19:43 - sorry it's kind of like a menacing Mark
19:45 - Zuckerberg no no that's true though like
19:47 - even like trying to show clients past
19:49 - work is like uh I can't really show this
19:52 - to you because it's not live anymore but
19:54 - I promise it was cool yeah exactly uh
19:57 - maybe some maybe it's on the internet
19:58 - archive somewhere so um so you build
20:02 - this site and like what happens next
20:04 - like does that kind of like does that
20:07 - serve as a a win that like helps push
20:11 - you to continue learn the win that I
20:13 - needed the the win that I really really
20:15 - needed because I didn't know how bad it
20:17 - like I was I didn't realize how bad I
20:20 - was feeling about myself cuz I'm like no
20:21 - architecture no sales like what am I
20:23 - doing everyone around me was you know
20:26 - all my friends were doing really really
20:28 - great things and I'm just sitting here
20:30 - so that was my way yeah and you're like
20:32 - 28 years old at this point approximately
20:34 - right yeah yeah so so just to put that
20:36 - in perspective like you probably have
20:38 - lots of friends who went to architecture
20:40 - school who are now working at like big
20:43 - contractors or developers or something
20:45 - like right like so a lot of your peer
20:47 - group is like Way Beyond where you were
20:50 - at that time and I hope that doesn't
20:52 - sound insensitive for me to say that
20:54 - because I was not at all like to some
20:56 - extent learning the code at age 31 right
20:58 - so but here you are in a completely
21:01 - different field like getting things done
21:04 - and and this this has to be like a huge
21:08 - win in terms of like motivation and like
21:11 - self-perception like I can actually get
21:13 - things done right yeah yeah it was I
21:15 - remember the feeling it was one of the
21:16 - first times in a long time that I felt
21:18 - like I wanted to do something and I
21:20 - actually did it like and it was hard and
21:23 - I didn't know how to do it at first but
21:24 - I did it like it it really motivates you
21:26 - to be like anything that comes your way
21:29 - now like I could probably figure it out
21:32 - if I could figure that out from
21:34 - nothing yeah so what do you do
21:37 - next okay so next um she so that was
21:40 - like her actual like front end part of
21:42 - the website um she needed something that
21:45 - kept like inventory and stuff and like
21:49 - you had to it's been a while but you had
21:52 - to you know upload prices somewhere and
21:55 - then like view the prices so like
21:56 - basically just like a a rest op so I
21:59 - went and I started learning like full
22:02 - stack
22:04 - um that was interesting and fun it was
22:07 - It was kind of it was doing that by
22:09 - yourself and being like an introvert is
22:11 - really hard because I don't want like I
22:13 - didn't want to reach out to anyone I
22:14 - didn't want to ask anyone any questions
22:16 - like I don't know any web developers
22:17 - like what so I just I really for the
22:21 - longest time I just kind of kept to
22:22 - myself I remember one problem took me
22:24 - like a week to figure out cuz I refused
22:26 - to like ask anyone or like I think I
22:28 - asked something on stack Overflow once
22:30 - and I got downvoted immediately so like
22:33 - just crazy so I'm like okay I'm not
22:35 - doing that anymore so um yeah I I I
22:38 - created this this little app that it's
22:41 - it's super simple but it allows them to
22:43 - upload some pricing and then like view
22:45 - the pricing later and then add their
22:47 - products and whatnot so that is not up
22:50 - anymore either but it was a great
22:51 - learning experience and um my mom was
22:54 - actually proud of me yeah well even
22:57 - though your mom was pretty proud of you
22:59 - like I know I know you've had to uh
23:01 - endure a lot of financial hardship uh
23:03 - during this process cuz I mean you're
23:05 - like a university drop out uh you you
23:08 - left your job at Sprint and you know
23:11 - maybe your mom was compensating you in
23:12 - any way in some way but like what were
23:14 - you doing were you like living with your
23:15 - family at this point or how were you
23:17 - getting by um yeah so I was just living
23:20 - with my boyfriend and I was not really
23:22 - getting by too well cuz I didn't
23:24 - actually have a job I was just helping
23:25 - my mom with this but she wasn't really
23:27 - paying me too much she was just helping
23:29 - me here and there but it wasn't like an
23:32 - actual job that paid you a lot like I I
23:35 - think I was you know she'd give me like
23:37 - $300 a week or something which again
23:39 - added to my feeling of just like what am
23:41 - I doing here like what is going on um
23:45 - yeah I was so broke living with my
23:48 - boyfriend like he had a part-time job I
23:49 - just I felt almost lost but like really
23:52 - excited too just like maybe I could
23:54 - learn to do this maybe I can actually
23:56 - like become a developer but yeah it was
23:59 - it was very difficult for a while um I
24:01 - remember my car my car was so old at the
24:04 - time like and Rusty um I woke up one day
24:09 - I went outside to my car and I had a
24:10 - ticket because they said it was like no
24:13 - abandoned cars on the street and it
24:16 - wasn't abandoned it just looked old cuz
24:18 - I just didn't have any money to get
24:20 - another one but like oh my gosh like
24:22 - that was the moment where I was just
24:23 - like freaked out I was like I can't even
24:25 - pay a $40 ticket cuz my car looks old
24:28 - what am I doing so that was like I don't
24:32 - even want to say low point because it
24:33 - wasn't cuz I was also really excited
24:35 - about like web dead but I was pretty low
24:39 - like something needs to happen like
24:41 - right now I need to figure something out
24:43 - yeah this is not sustainable like and I
24:46 - need a new car cuz the AC in mine did
24:49 - not work and Texas is not forgiving when
24:51 - it comes to that summer yeah so
24:56 - um what did you do like like did did
24:59 - your financial hardship kind of like
25:01 - apply additional pressure did it help
25:02 - you kind of get over some of your
25:04 - introversion start asking people for
25:06 - help how did you meet other developers
25:08 - what did you do from there okay yeah so
25:10 - that definitely not even that helped me
25:12 - get over my intro version like I was
25:14 - still dead set on I am not contacting
25:17 - anyone which for anyone listening by the
25:19 - way just reach out like it's so much
25:20 - easier and I love it when people reach
25:22 - out and I love talking to people and I
25:24 - love having conversations with
25:25 - developers that have questions like I
25:27 - don't know why I didn't didn't do it
25:29 - just do it um but yeah that definitely
25:32 - was just
25:35 - like I needed to do something so I
25:37 - started applying like I thought maybe
25:39 - I'm ready like maybe I can apply and get
25:42 - like an actual coding job like a
25:45 - professional job
25:48 - um that was that was an experience your
25:51 - first trying to apply to your first
25:53 - professional job as a developer as a
25:56 - self-taught developer oh my gosh as an
25:59 - introverted self-taught developer who's
26:01 - also very desperate for something
26:04 - anything was crazy I um I went through
26:08 - like three or four interviews at
26:09 - different companies like didn't even
26:10 - pass the first
26:12 - screening um and I don't even know how
26:15 - this happened honestly like I one day
26:17 - late at night it was like 12:00 at night
26:20 - I was like three glasses of wine in
26:22 - playing video games um and I looked at
26:26 - LinkedIn and there was this one post
26:28 - like for a job it wasn't even web
26:30 - developer it was web content
26:32 - administrator and I was like that sounds
26:35 - great like it has it's like kind of
26:37 - Webby you know and I know kind of Webby
26:40 - like so I applied and 10 minutes later
26:43 - the recruiter responded like oh this is
26:44 - great like let's talk tomorrow and that
26:47 - was like the first time that I was like
26:48 - I was I put my glass down I was like oh
26:50 - my gosh okay okay maybe maybe so then
26:53 - the next day I talked to the recruiter
26:55 - she was wonderful like so incredibly
26:57 - kind and
26:59 - just passed me on to the manager and
27:03 - somehow like she gave me this I remember
27:06 - the take-home was the PSD file and I had
27:09 - to code it and I was so scared of like
27:11 - asking questions or anything I remember
27:12 - like can I use a framework can I use
27:15 - bootstrap like I was just thinking all
27:16 - these things but I don't want to ask
27:18 - because I don't ask questions right yeah
27:20 - so um yeah I just coded it CSS whatever
27:25 - but I got it she called me and gave me
27:28 - the job and I I'm still friends with
27:29 - that manager to this day like you're
27:31 - going to have a a call next week I think
27:34 - um yeah but yeah they gave me a shot
27:36 - they took a chance on me and were like
27:37 - you don't have any experience really but
27:40 - like yeah it was I mean if you can do
27:42 - the work you can do the work right that
27:44 - was yeah that was the win that I needed
27:46 - like that that right there that job like
27:48 - it was everything right like they the
27:50 - pay was awful but this large mortgage
27:54 - company like allowed me to like go kind
27:56 - of nuts too right like
27:59 - uh they had like contest sites which
28:00 - were super fun like you know we want to
28:02 - do a cool like um Lottery and so I was
28:07 - like oh okay you want to do like a
28:08 - lottery I'm like okay well what if you
28:11 - get like realistic looking Lottery balls
28:13 - and then what if you have like a screen
28:16 - where they you know flip and then the
28:18 - lottery number comes out then what if
28:20 - you drop it down this like realistic
28:21 - looking little tube and then they like
28:24 - drop down and then confetti comes out
28:26 - and all this really cool stuff stuff and
28:28 - they were like yeah if you can do it
28:30 - just do it and I couldn't but I figured
28:32 - it out like it was all those like cool
28:34 - ideas that you just need someone to be
28:36 - like yeah go nuts when you get excited
28:37 - about something and then that's where
28:39 - you learn right like yeah well it's cool
28:41 - first of all that you're like basically
28:43 - making all this work for yourself a lot
28:45 - of people who are lazy might just be
28:46 - like oh sure good enough but you're like
28:48 - no it could do you see the potential for
28:50 - what this project could be and you're
28:52 - like let's let's go all the way with
28:54 - this project yeah yeah and it's like
28:56 - it's a forgettable project like it was
28:58 - just for that year but it was super fun
29:00 - to do um there was another one where
29:02 - they had like a Halloween contest and I
29:04 - thought what if we make this look old
29:06 - school and so I had like an old school
29:07 - looking TV that I put like a screen over
29:09 - so it looks like we're on the screen and
29:12 - then little I made little CSS Polaroids
29:15 - and like did a cute little I don't know
29:17 - it's so much fun to just do like weird
29:19 - cute little things that people are just
29:21 - like oh that's that's creative that's
29:23 - weird yeah yeah well so what is it like
29:28 - settling in cuz you I mean you mentioned
29:30 - you're like hardcore introvert like
29:33 - afraid to ask people questions willing
29:35 - to toil for an entire week on a problem
29:37 - rather than just asking for help like
29:39 - did you have to report to an office like
29:41 - like who were you working with um I was
29:43 - yeah so I actually worked at an office
29:46 - um and the manager above me she was who
29:51 - I reported directly to it's just me her
29:53 - and this one other girl that were the U
29:56 - developers not really Developers there
29:58 - was one other developer and he was
29:59 - really he was way better than both of us
30:02 - but um pretty much it was just me
30:04 - reporting to my manager and so she was
30:08 - she she's a developer she was
30:09 - self-taught as well um so yeah she she
30:13 - helps me out a lot she gave me a bunch
30:15 - of ideas on things to do and um you know
30:18 - I I remember like freaking out I would
30:19 - have like a bunch of question she like
30:21 - basically calmed me down and told me
30:23 - like you can ask questions like it's not
30:26 - you know or she would she was very
30:28 - patient with me at first because I freak
30:30 - out very easily as well since I don't
30:32 - want to ask questions like I don't know
30:33 - if I'm doing the right thing which I
30:35 - need to just ask if I'm doing the right
30:37 - this so like it's just it's a lot of
30:38 - patience when you're a manager with the
30:40 - first time like Stu like not student
30:42 - with the self-taught firsttime job she
30:45 - was very kind I got very lucky very
30:48 - lucky yeah and I'm thrilled that it
30:50 - worked out well and you and you kind of
30:52 - stayed uh in that uh mortgage space
30:55 - which let's talk about that for a second
30:57 - because I think a lot of people Envision
31:00 - oh I'm going to work at Google or I'm
31:02 - going to work at you know Microsoft or
31:04 - one of these big prominent tech
31:05 - companies that that's their eventual
31:07 - goal and what I always tell people is
31:09 - two-thirds of all Developer jobs are
31:12 - outside of what we conventionally think
31:14 - of as Tech right they're they're working
31:16 - at like you know an automotive company
31:19 - or uh Hospital chain or any number of
31:21 - different types of uh Industries right
31:26 - everybody needs developers everybody's
31:27 - trying to push push things to the
31:28 - software developer or to the software
31:30 - layer everybody's trying to figure out
31:33 - uh ways that they can better reach
31:35 - customers through technology things like
31:37 - that right so right yeah maybe you could
31:39 - talk a little bit about that like
31:41 - because you uh up until relatively
31:45 - recently you were working in kind of
31:46 - like the the mortgage industry right
31:51 - yeah yeah and honestly like I for just
31:54 - starting out like I knew that I wasn't
31:56 - ever going to get into like Google or
31:58 - LinkedIn or and Netflix whatever so I
32:02 - you know go for the easier jobs and
32:03 - everything
32:05 - but even I don't know yeah like you said
32:08 - the most of the tech jobs are not in
32:11 - those companies they're and just like
32:13 - what sounds almost like boring companies
32:15 - but it's they're great jobs they're a
32:18 - lot of fun you get to do a lot of things
32:20 - like as long as you have a good manager
32:21 - and good working environment like you're
32:24 - Off to the Races it's great and it's a
32:26 - lot of fun yeah some of the the I mean
32:28 - just because it's like an industry
32:30 - that's like really old doesn't mean
32:31 - there's not really exciting work to be
32:33 - done in that field and a lot of those
32:36 - companies are you know the jobs are a
32:38 - lot more stable and um it can be a lot
32:42 - more like better work life balance and
32:44 - things like that then going to some
32:46 - crazy like Silicon Valley like Tech
32:48 - startup where they expect you to work
32:50 - like all day every day and like yeah
32:53 - exactly yeah like and you know someone
32:56 - at Google isn't going to let me go nuts
32:57 - on a landing page for a lottery like for
33:00 - fun you know but you can do that at
33:02 - companies that aren't only like tech
33:04 - tech yeah you know you can go and just
33:08 - do fun weird crazy things at different
33:10 - companies and it sounds like you were
33:11 - working on a pretty small team you you
33:13 - said there were just a couple other
33:14 - developers yeah uh and I always tell
33:17 - people like working on a small team
33:18 - gives you the ability to do a lot of
33:20 - everything would you agree with that
33:22 - sentiment yeah absolutely yeah you kind
33:25 - of have to wear a bunch of hats because
33:27 - it's the team is so small yeah um and
33:31 - you know you kind of grow and learn
33:32 - together which is a great part of being
33:34 - in a small team yeah so that first
33:36 - couple years of working in Tech like
33:39 - what what were some of and when I say
33:41 - working in Tech we just established it's
33:42 - a it's a mortgage company but working as
33:44 - a developer sometimes I use working in
33:46 - Tech and working as a developer
33:48 - synonymously um but uh what was that
33:51 - like like what were were there any like
33:54 - standout moments in your kind of
33:57 - progression as a developer where you
33:59 - felt like you just unlocked some entire
34:01 - new aspect of your brain that you didn't
34:03 - know
34:04 - existed yeah yeah like just any kind of
34:07 - like the creativity idea like the um
34:10 - creating the little realistic balls
34:11 - you're like oh my gosh okay so I could
34:13 - do that and then I learn illustrator and
34:14 - then I can bring that SVG into into code
34:19 - and then animate that with JavaScript
34:21 - like what yeah I didn't even know I
34:23 - could do that like you just yeah that
34:25 - you unlocked um I remember we read about
34:29 - some sort of uh the accessibility like
34:32 - the lawsuits and everything that was all
34:33 - starting when I first started there uh
34:36 - we started that kind of unlocked
34:38 - everything so I was like I didn't know
34:39 - anything about accessibility really so I
34:41 - started reading more and then we like we
34:44 - uh went back and like made thousands of
34:47 - landing pages that we have for that
34:48 - company just like accessible so that
34:50 - like unlocked something else like oh my
34:52 - gosh like people you know like need
34:56 - people that aren't me that need to like
34:58 - read this everyone needs to be able to
35:00 - like learn and read this so that that
35:02 - was great too like yeah the you know the
35:06 - the late 2010s whatever that decade is
35:09 - called like that was really a
35:10 - Renaissance for accessibility we're
35:12 - still feeling that today like uh there
35:16 - there's so many different websites and
35:18 - and sub pages and everything that can be
35:21 - gone through and made accessible and
35:23 - it's like yeah it's it's not that much
35:26 - work and it makes all the difference for
35:28 - so many people uh I think something like
35:31 - 15% of people on earth live with a
35:34 - disability right um so yeah it sounds
35:37 - like really important impactful work so
35:39 - you were able to like sit down and like
35:42 - okay today I'm making these pages exess
35:44 - Bill and like did that was that a good
35:46 - feeling like were you able to like what
35:49 - was your mom thinking this entire time I
35:51 - guess curious because she's seen her
35:53 - daughter go from you know College
35:55 - Dropout who's like you know getting
35:58 - tickets because her car is too uh old
36:01 - and Rusty old and Rusty uh and you know
36:04 - like like kind of like uh living a hand
36:06 - to mouth existence so to speak and now
36:09 - she's going out there and having such an
36:10 - impact helping uh improve these websites
36:13 - and yeah like what did she ever talk
36:17 - with you about that oh yeah yeah I mean
36:20 - I tell my mom everything so she was very
36:21 - excited for me like anything cool that I
36:23 - did or something I sent her I mean like
36:25 - I even I even called her when I won like
36:28 - this Call of Duty war zone game like I
36:30 - she I tell her like everything right
36:32 - like so yeah no she was proud she's
36:34 - aware like she's like I didn't even know

36:38 - sister she was giving birth and I was in
36:40 - the hospital like learning with my
36:41 - laptop like oh okay so I could move this
36:43 - here and this that because you know

37:33 - for me when I was when I was real down
37:37 - in the dumps um yeah it's it's been
37:40 - great it there's nothing like having a
37:42 - supportive spouse when you're trying to
37:43 - learn and like pivot into something
37:46 - completely different like when he met me
37:48 - I didn't even have a job and I didn't
37:50 - know what I was doing and he still was
37:52 - just like yeah I like her yeah so that
37:55 - was great like you know you like he
37:57 - likes you for you so that's great um
38:00 - then he uh he his job got moved to
38:03 - Houston so I had to move to Houston with
38:06 - him so I moved to a different part of
38:09 - the mortgage company to the different
38:11 - office but that's kind of where
38:13 - everything changed too because that's
38:15 - when I was like okay so
38:18 - maybe you know it just once you move
38:20 - cities you kind of start like taking
38:23 - like looking at your life and being like
38:24 - okay I think I can I think I'm like
38:26 - ready you know to do something a little
38:28 - bit bigger than what what this is like I
38:30 - want to I want to move on and my husband
38:33 - was amazing about everything just like
38:34 - yeah like you should like I think you're
38:36 - great like as a husband does but um yeah
38:39 - I think that that move if it weren't for
38:42 - him and that whole move and everything I
38:44 - don't I'm not even sure where I would
38:46 - where I would be like yeah he helps me a
38:49 - lot and without him I don't I wouldn't
38:51 - even be a developer yeah yeah wow well
38:54 - um gooders to him for uh being so
38:56 - supportive that that's really chill my
38:58 - wife was extremely supportive when me as
39:01 - like a 31y old man hey I'm going to stop
39:03 - being a School director I'm going to
39:04 - learn the code she was super she had and
39:07 - she practically as a as an American she
39:09 - had insurance through her company so I
39:12 - had health insurance coverage even
39:13 - though I was just you know heads down
39:15 - for like nine months learning the code
39:17 - while I was at the library and stuff so
39:20 - um yeah that's super chill that he was
39:22 - there uh to support you and um it not
39:26 - just emotionally but like with your your
39:28 - $40
39:30 - ticket so yeah maybe we can talk about
39:34 - this new Awakening when you arrive in
39:36 - Houston Houston is one of the biggest
39:38 - cities in the United States uh it's like
39:41 - the Metroplex that the Dallas Fort Worth
39:44 - Metroplex and and the Houston Metroplex
39:46 - they're they're like the two biggest
39:48 - parts of Texas which is the second
39:50 - biggest state right behind California in
39:52 - terms of population uh they're even
39:54 - though they're both in Texas they're
39:56 - pretty far away from from each other
39:57 - like it takes me about 4 hours to drive
39:59 - down to Houston from here maybe you
40:01 - could talk about what it was like
40:02 - arriving in this big city is this the
40:03 - biggest city you've ever lived in yeah
40:06 - yeah it is so I mean we and we moved to
40:10 - like a really nice little apartment like
40:12 - in the middle of like the heights so it
40:14 - was just like bustling stuff everywhere
40:16 - like bars restaurants like it was so
40:18 - cool to see all that cuz we didn't have
40:20 - that before we I'd never like lived in
40:22 - like a really cool part of a city you
40:24 - know so it was fun and it was fun seeing
40:26 - like all these people
40:28 - like you know you like successful people
40:31 - around you like it just helps you like
40:32 - you know talk to people like neighbors
40:34 - and stuff just like seeing what they're
40:36 - doing how hard they're working like it
40:39 - it is kind of an Awakening like just
40:40 - being just getting taken out of your
40:43 - comfort zone is an Awakening no matter
40:45 - what you do right like it's so it was
40:47 - just it was a huge inspiration that like
40:50 - I want to I now that I'm like more
40:52 - comfortable with change I want to I want
40:54 - to do more I want to like do a lot more
40:58 - actually so yeah and I was thinking like
41:01 - okay like how do I even improve my code
41:03 - how do I get better like I need to get
41:05 - better like it was I I think I got a
41:07 - little bit complacent at the mortgage
41:09 - company um but that move really helped
41:12 - with that so I was like maybe I'll start
41:13 - like a 100 days of code I've seen that
41:15 - like on Twitter where
41:17 - I uh I started a account like 10 years
41:20 - ago and it was just there I was like
41:22 - okay maybe and then the pandemic hit
41:25 - yeah and that's what like we all started
41:28 - working from home so I had even more
41:30 - time in the day so I really like I was
41:31 - like I'll just do 100 days of code and I
41:36 - started that and I started posting I had
41:38 - five followers like I was just posting
41:41 - yes and then also sending it to my
41:43 - mother um but she wasn't going to join
41:45 - Twitter so it's just five followers and
41:46 - my mom on the side uh and yeah it just
41:50 - like every day I was just striving to
41:52 - just get a little bit better like a
41:53 - little bit better just uh you know it
41:56 - started off with
41:57 - like how to do like a little falling
42:01 - down animation in sequence like a make a
42:04 - word fall down like the letters like hit
42:06 - each other yeah you know things like
42:08 - that like super silly things like I got
42:10 - really into loading animations just to
42:11 - learn animations like and the more I
42:14 - posted the more like I saw people were
42:16 - like oh that's cool that's cool and I'm
42:17 - like oh my gosh other people think
42:18 - that's cool and so then I got inspired
42:20 - looking at other people's code and it
42:22 - just oh my gosh it gets so exciting once
42:25 - you like finally start talking to other
42:27 - people like that that opened up
42:28 - everything like Twitter just like I was
42:31 - like whoa like everyone is so talented
42:35 - 100 days of code Twitter like I mean
42:37 - you've got 50,000 followers now so you
42:40 - literally grew your following by 10,000
42:42 - times in this time uh posting uh about
42:46 - yeah just posting things that I make
42:48 - that I think are kind of cool like
42:50 - that's it yeah and that I mean that's
42:54 - the secret like there's so much
42:55 - authenticity when I like scroll through
42:57 - your Twitter feed and as like you're
42:59 - just being you you're You're Building
43:01 - you're using your skills to build things
43:02 - that you think are interesting uh let's
43:05 - talk about like agency life like working
43:09 - at an agency so you're no longer at a
43:11 - mortgage company now you're working at a
43:14 - kind of like Dev consultancy agency
43:16 - doing work probably for a lot of
43:18 - different companies can you talk about
43:19 - that a little bit yeah it's so much fun
43:22 - to work at an agency like I don't I even
43:25 - told my husband recently like I don't
43:26 - think I could see myself moving to like
43:28 - another corporate job like that cuz
43:30 - agency like you you get to work on
43:33 - everything like you know it's not just
43:35 - one project and you're improving it
43:37 - forever or whatever it's new projects
43:40 - new projects like can you do this I
43:41 - don't know how but we'll figure it out
43:43 - like it's so much fun it's chaotic
43:45 - agency life is so chaotic and it's like
43:47 - you have to wear so many hats CU you're
43:49 - not a big corporate company you're just
43:51 - an agency so like oh you need to figure
43:53 - out how to do reports on Google
43:54 - analytics okay like I guess we'll figure
43:56 - this out um
43:58 - or oh you need X Y and Z like okay we're
44:00 - going to figure out how to do that or
44:03 - you need like a video platform you know
44:05 - so agency life is just really really fun
44:07 - like if you want to ever level up like
44:09 - crazy it's it's going to be in my
44:10 - opinion at an agency yeah and I've heard
44:12 - the same from so many people that work
44:14 - at agencies like you just get to work on
44:17 - so many more projects uh if you work at
44:19 - a big company that might stick you in a
44:21 - department and you just work on that you
44:23 - know code base for years you know um but
44:26 - you're I mean how many different
44:27 - projects are you taking on a year would
44:29 - you say if you were to
44:31 - estimate oh my gosh probably
44:34 - like probably like 15 or so 15 projects
44:37 - a year that you're touching yeah yeah
44:40 - yeah and then like a lot of them a lot
44:42 - of projects I'm also just like keeping
44:45 - up with and adding to but like new
44:47 - projects new things yeah about 15 I'd
44:50 - say yeah and you're you're able to work
44:52 - remotely yeah yeah most of my all of my
44:56 - co-workers are in seatt and I'm the only
44:57 - one in Texas cuz they said oh it's the
45:00 - pandemic we'll hire someone from out of
45:01 - state yeah I just met them like a month
45:04 - ago in real life for the first time so
45:06 - that's exciting that's cool yeah uh yeah
45:08 - a lot of tech up in Seattle uh and like
45:12 - a lot of you know big customers and
45:13 - stuff so it makes sense that they'd be
45:15 - out there um but that's that's so cool
45:17 - that you know you can live in Houston of
45:19 - course uh you know being a Texan growing
45:22 - up here I used to live in Houston when I
45:24 - was a kid actually uh I probably left
45:27 - Houston because I'm a bit older than you
45:28 - I was probably not living in Houston uh
45:31 - obviously not now but I think I lived
45:33 - there till I was like six or wait I
45:35 - lived there from like age five to like
45:37 - age 10 I think so I lived there for five
45:39 - years yeah and that was my kind of Texas
45:42 - upbringing and my first um encounter
45:44 - with the humidity and the heat
45:47 - of it's insane like you don't think it's
45:50 - going to be that bad and it's like way
45:52 - worse than you could ever imagine yeah
45:54 - especially for someone with curly hair
45:57 - oh my gosh
45:59 - so I'm really excited to learn a little
46:02 - bit more about lessons you've learned
46:04 - from this because overcoming to some
46:06 - extent your introversion and uh being
46:09 - able to get things done on teams working
46:12 - with clients um of course learning the
46:15 - code really well um not just front end
46:18 - development but like going extremely
46:19 - deep on CSS
46:22 - specifically that's so cool what are
46:24 - some observations that you have about
46:27 - your journey that like you think would
46:28 - be like super actionable for someone
46:30 - like what advice would you send back in
46:32 - time to
46:33 - yourself well yeah great question a like
46:37 - um 100% like main one is ask for help
46:40 - when you're stuck because otherwise
46:43 - you're going to spend so much
46:44 - unnecessary time just being stuck when
46:47 - you don't actually have to be and people
46:48 - are a lot nicer than you think they
46:51 - are yeah um anyone needs anything I'm
46:54 - happy to like help always Reach Out me
46:57 - I'm totally here um what else let's see
47:01 - 100 days of code 100 just consistency
47:04 - pretty much is what it is right like you
47:06 - can spend like 3 hours learning how to
47:09 - do something and then you don't touch it
47:11 - again you're going to forget yeah that
47:13 - was a huge deal for me that was
47:14 - something that like feels obvious but I
47:16 - needed to learn like 17 times before I
47:18 - finally got it so really it's just the
47:21 - consistency sharing your code is
47:23 - important to me I mean a lot of people
47:25 - probably don't think it's a good idea
47:29 - maybe you don't want to share on social
47:30 - media maybe you know you're scared to
47:32 - post But like everyone again is so kind
47:35 - and it's fun to get feedback maybe you
47:37 - learn something you can do better um
47:40 - it's just it's very important to like
47:41 - talk to other developers just get out of
47:43 - your box a little bit and just learn you
47:46 - know and if you think something looks
47:47 - cool try to figure out how to do it try
47:49 - to like Decon deconstruct it see how
47:52 - they do that like just being curious
47:55 - when you feel yourself getting
47:56 - complacent and like try to like you know
47:59 - see that that's like a feeling and
48:00 - that's what you're doing like try to
48:01 - recognize it and try to Pivot a little
48:04 - bit from that but also don't get burned
48:07 - out because I've done that so many times
48:10 - that yeah it's like a habit we talk
48:12 - about that real quick because I mean
48:14 - that like that's the biggest
48:15 - occupational hazard other than like
48:16 - repetitive stress injury or eye strain
48:19 - or uh some people uh I know have got
48:21 - like vertigo from staring at a screen
48:23 - too much and things like that which is
48:25 - very debilitating but like burnout is
48:28 - very real and like a lot of people that
48:30 - I've talked to have gone through periods
48:32 - of burnout
48:34 - can when was the I I guess the first
48:36 - time you started feeling burned out and
48:39 - what did that feel
48:40 - like um the first time was when I
48:43 - started posting a lot on social media
48:45 - that I felt like I should probably keep
48:47 - posting I should make I should keep
48:48 - making more CSS art like you kind of
48:50 - start getting in this mode that you're
48:51 - like I need to keep learning I need to
48:52 - keep posting like you kind of start
48:54 - moving into like robotic mode almost um
48:58 - and then I started getting less excited
49:00 - I started getting more tired I started
49:02 - dreading opening up social media like
49:05 - that's when I was like uh oh like this
49:07 - what am I doing
49:08 - but I'm so stubborn that I just kind of
49:11 - try to push through it and then you burn
49:12 - out yeah um and I actually just came out
49:16 - of a burnout recently too because I
49:17 - don't when I get an idea in my head I
49:19 - get so excited I get just so hyped I
49:22 - want to do it night and day like wake up
49:24 - go to sleep do it and then I just just
49:26 - burned myself out so I've kind of
49:29 - resigned myself to the fact that
49:31 - I'm oh sorry that I'm a kind of person
49:33 - that like I'm like a dog with a bone and
49:36 - then once I finish the bone I need like
49:38 - a month break of like extracurriculars
49:40 - and then I can go
49:42 - back yeah I'm so I'm taking so many
49:44 - notes uh because I I feel your
49:46 - description of like you know that that
49:49 - kind of you get into production mode
49:51 - where you're like I've got to ship this
49:53 - and I you know and probably at the same
49:55 - time you know social media is like you
49:57 - see those numbers climb there's uh Jeff
50:00 - Atwood founder of sty overflow whom I've
50:02 - interviewed on uh the uh freeing podcast
50:05 - previously he he has a great saying he
50:07 - says the moment you put a number next to
50:10 - somebody's face that's where like
50:13 - problems happen because people are going
50:15 - to try to make that number go up right
50:18 - and yeah it's it's like a game yeah yeah
50:21 - and I mean you've been so amazing at
50:22 - that game but at the same time it can it
50:25 - can feel like a grind like and it can
50:28 - almost feel like the the the people that
50:30 - are actually like saying kind things and
50:32 - everything that kind of gets abstracted
50:33 - away like people are saying nice things
50:35 - but my number's not going up as fast as
50:37 - it used to or something like that or
50:39 - yeah or like what what's wrong like I
50:40 - just worked really hard on this I
50:42 - published it like have you ever
50:43 - published uh a new piece of art and just
50:46 - felt like it wasn't as well received as
50:48 - your like previous work oh yeah yeah and
50:51 - that's when I have to like step back and
50:52 - be like it's not even it's not even
50:55 - about that like it's just that I get so
50:57 - sad that other people aren't as excited
50:59 - as I am about it but that's okay because
51:01 - like I'm not as excited about everything
51:04 - either it's just like it stings a little
51:06 - bit it stings the heart a little bit
51:07 - after like five hours of working on
51:09 - something yeah like I've written more
51:11 - than 500 articles for like the free C
51:13 - Camp publication and like there was this
51:15 - one that I spent like three days on I
51:17 - worked so hard on it and I was like so
51:18 - proud of it and I published it in like
51:20 - very few people read I mean it was still
51:22 - like you know I feel guilty even saying
51:25 - like oh only a few th000 people read
51:27 - this article but still you know is like
51:29 - you kind of get like acclimated to
51:32 - success and anything that's not like
51:34 - absolute unadulterated success feels
51:36 - like a step down and yeah that
51:38 - definitely kind of like made me question
51:40 - should I really work this hard on a
51:42 - single article if like all of them but
51:44 - obviously like when looking at your art
51:46 - it's clear that you spend a great deal
51:47 - of time on these H how do you do it how
51:51 - do you how do you push forward you know
51:54 - meticulously crafting these pieces uh
51:58 - like is there ever a voice in your head
52:00 - like H people aren't going to like this
52:01 - as much do do you have like a critical
52:03 - voice in your head ever no not when I
52:05 - start it when I start it I like I said
52:07 - dog with the bone I am in it and I'm
52:09 - going to finish this because I'm going
52:10 - to finish this I don't care if this
52:12 - looks weird or hard like I'm going to
52:14 - finish this and then it's not until
52:15 - after that I get like a little hangover
52:17 - like what did I just do or is anyone
52:19 - even going to like this yeah why did I
52:21 - just spend eight hours on this yeah it's
52:23 - it's not during it's after Okay so so
52:27 - that's I mean that's a really con
52:29 - convenient way for your mind to work
52:30 - because for me I'm always doubting
52:31 - things before I even start or as I'm
52:33 - doing it I'm like St to doubt like uh
52:36 - for example like with my music like I
52:38 - created the soundtrack for The learn to
52:40 - code RPG and the whole time like are
52:42 - people going to just think this is janky
52:44 - like is it going to sound amateurish and
52:47 - uh like I was doubting myself the entire
52:49 - time uh so it I would love to have it
52:52 - sounds like a superpower to be able to
52:54 - like just power through and only after
52:55 - you finish working so hard on something
52:57 - do you start to doubt but the work is
52:59 - already done so it's it's like you're
53:01 - not really discourage once the work is
53:03 - already done you just have to like yeah
53:05 - that's that's a really cool Quirk see
53:08 - but that's different though from the
53:10 - from the music because the the art I
53:13 - already know what it needs to look like
53:15 - I know what the endgame is the music you
53:17 - need to be creative and be like okay I
53:19 - have to do this I have to do that the
53:20 - art is already written for like I I just
53:23 - I know I see it and I have to make sure
53:25 - it looks like that at the end so so how
53:27 - does what is your process like so you
53:28 - identify some sort of object or some
53:31 - sort of like maybe you can walk an
53:34 - electronic yeah yeah just walk us
53:36 - through an entire
53:37 - project yeah okay so like I start
53:41 - getting kind of the itch of like okay I
53:42 - kind of want to draw something do
53:43 - creative okay so I start Pinterest um
53:46 - it's already totally geared to like me
53:49 - so it shows me a bunch of electronics
53:51 - with really nice like edges and stuff
53:54 - that um would be easy to draw with CSS
53:56 - art so I just scroll open up a bunch of
53:58 - tabs and then after I have like 10 open
54:01 - I go through those and I'm like okay
54:03 - this
54:04 - one so then I keep that tab open and I
54:11 - put it as a background image on my code
54:13 - and then I just kind of outline the
54:15 - shape of it so that I know the shapes
54:17 - the main shapes are right and then after
54:19 - that I'm off to the races I start with
54:21 - just any little thing that I think is
54:23 - like the easiest thing to start with and
54:25 - from there you just you just go yeah and
54:28 - so so do you do like the big like I mean
54:31 - when you scroll through your landing
54:32 - page it shows like the big squares
54:34 - appear first and then you kind of go
54:35 - through and you add fine details maybe
54:37 - you'll zoom in and really focus on like
54:39 - the flash component and you'll spend a
54:41 - whole lot of time on that and then
54:42 - you'll go do the viewfinder and then
54:44 - you'll do like the lens like how do you
54:47 - because I've seen people draw like I
54:49 - don't I can't draw for the damn but like
54:51 - they'll often like it almost seems
54:53 - arbitrary what they're focused on like
54:55 - they just jump around almost
54:56 - yeah is it so it's just like a yeah it's
54:58 - arbitrary for me it's just whatever
55:00 - looks like I'm going to that's that's
55:02 - what I feel like I'm going to do right
55:03 - now I'm going to just do that and I'm
55:05 - going to focus on it so like I think I
55:07 - did the flash first or I I'm pretty sure
55:09 - it's the flash I'm not very familiar
55:11 - with camera Parts but the flash part um
55:15 - and so I'm like okay I'm going to make
55:16 - this perfect and then I'm like okay that
55:18 - looks good but now it's just like
55:20 - squares and a flash a really nice
55:23 - looking Flash and so then you just move
55:24 - on to the next thing and then the next
55:26 - thing
55:27 - um and then the logo is always the last
55:28 - thing to go on but yeah yeah
55:33 - and I
55:35 - guess how would you recommend somebody
55:37 - if they want to create CSS art like you
55:40 - do if they want to try to create photo
55:43 - realistic images using CSS what would be
55:46 - some tips if somebody let's say that
55:48 - somebody has like a free weekend and
55:50 - they're like I want to get better at CSS
55:51 - and I'm going to use this project I'm
55:53 - going to like you have a a photo real
55:56 - istic Xbox controller right like
55:58 - somebody gets a they they find a photo
56:00 - of an Xbox or maybe like uh some new
56:03 - synthesizer module or something like
56:05 - that that they they just find online and
56:07 - this is like this is a beautiful you
56:09 - know aesthetic piece of hardware and I
56:11 - or or their favorite mechanical keyboard
56:12 - or something they want to recreate that
56:13 - in CSS what would be your advice to
56:17 - getting started with that process and
56:19 - getting better at CSS art yeah so my
56:22 - advice would be for first things first
56:24 - like try to create create something with
56:27 - a single div like learn how to stack
56:30 - backgrounds that's it like that's once
56:32 - you
56:33 - can make like a pretty simple image and
56:36 - you can learn how backgrounds can stack
56:38 - on top of each other how the linear
56:40 - gradients can stack or radial
56:43 - um after that it's pretty simple it's I
56:46 - mean I don't want to say simple but like
56:49 - it's it's tedious but it's simple like
56:52 - it's just very detail oriented but once
56:54 - you figure out how the gradient
56:57 - work in a background and how positioning
56:59 - Works you're you're pretty good it's
57:02 - just starting off like really what I
57:03 - started off with was just single divs
57:05 - and stacking the backgrounds to make
57:07 - something I I think my first one was a
57:09 - window and I just made the window like
57:11 - shiny and I was like oh my gosh and then
57:14 - I was like What if I add a ledge okay
57:16 - let me stock this background and then I
57:19 - can move the background and I can make
57:20 - it be just like x height in the same div
57:25 - and it's a ledge now like it's just that
57:27 - moment that you're just like okay so
57:28 - that's how you do it and then yeah
57:30 - you're good from there really it it
57:33 - looks a lot harder because it than it is
57:35 - because there's so much code but it's
57:37 - it's really not it's the same properties
57:38 - over and over again and it's a lot of
57:40 - fun yeah well are there any projects
57:44 - that you're working on right now and I
57:46 - mean you're working full-time you know
57:48 - you you got like your own personal life
57:49 - and stuff but like do you have any
57:52 - projects that uh you're like I can't
57:54 - wait to build this you don't have to
57:55 - spoil what they're going to be but do
57:57 - you do you have anything that you're
57:59 - getting ready to
58:00 - start um yeah so I I'm working on a CSS
58:04 - course that's uh it took a little bit of
58:07 - a break because of the whole burnout
58:08 - thing um but I I also want to start uh
58:11 - streaming more code um I'm just I'm not
58:16 - sure 100% on how that would work I want
58:18 - to I want to stream CSS art but it takes
58:21 - so long to do that I'm not sure like if
58:23 - that's even a good idea so like that's
58:25 - kind of running around in my head if
58:27 - anyone has any ideas I want to do with
58:28 - that let me know but um that's yeah
58:31 - definitely I want to do more YouTube
58:33 - videos uh and articles I really want to
58:36 - write articles I never write articles we
58:38 - would love to publish some of your
58:39 - articles on uh the free cocam
58:41 - publication if at some point you're
58:42 - interested in in yeah that would be
58:45 - great like a getting started to CSS art
58:47 - article I think would be solid that
58:48 - would be amazing I'd love to publicize
58:50 - that to the community um one thing like
58:53 - this is some unsolicited advice one
58:55 - thing you might consider doing is just
58:57 - keeping your screen recorder going while
58:59 - you're working and then you have this
59:01 - artifact like a recording of you
59:03 - building an entire project and then you
59:06 - could always just speed that up a little
59:07 - bit if it's slow and uh then you you
59:10 - could you know have like a 20x speed
59:13 - because there have been some really cool
59:14 - videos where people are like building
59:16 - uis and stuff and they'll be jumping
59:17 - back and forth from their Editor to the
59:19 - the browser to see what it looks like
59:21 - and stuff and you could just speed that
59:23 - up and put that with some like copyright
59:25 - free music or some like stream okay
59:28 - music and you can put that out that
59:29 - might be a really good way of like
59:30 - testing the water because live streaming
59:33 - is a commitment I spent like a year or
59:36 - two streaming on Twitch and it was so
59:38 - much work compared to like just
59:40 - recording like a a synchronous video and
59:43 - editing it publishing it yeah so I'm not
59:45 - trying to turn anybody off from
59:47 - streaming but it's very hard to get
59:50 - people to like actually watch your
59:52 - stream because they have to be free at
59:54 - that exact moment they have to be like
59:56 - in a place where they're like oh I'm
59:57 - going to sit down I'm going to watch
59:58 - somebody and at the same time twitch has
60:00 - like terrible discoverability you can
60:02 - stream on YouTube but people don't
60:04 - really look at YouTube as like oh I'm
60:06 - streaming on YouTube people think of
60:07 - twitch and twitch doesn't really have a
60:09 - Cate they've got like just chatting
60:10 - they've got like maybe an art category
60:13 - but they don't really have an a category
60:14 - for coding despite the fact that the
60:16 - developer community's been asking for
60:17 - this forever right um oh interesting and
60:20 - that would make a huge difference in
60:21 - terms of discoverability so my humble
60:23 - advice to anybody who's considering
60:25 - streaming like start with YouTube and
60:26 - start with like asynchronously recorded
60:28 - videos where you can edit them and make
60:29 - them more Punchy and stuff it's so much
60:31 - easier to get people to watch a YouTube
60:33 - video that they can watch at any time
60:35 - than to try to get people to tune in at
60:37 - a very specific time to watch you do
60:39 - that and the fact that you can speed it
60:41 - up even if it's not that exciting
60:43 - everything's exciting if you make it
60:44 - fast enough right I agree I agree I need
60:47 - to watch everything faster listen to
60:49 - everything faster like yeah yeah so
60:52 - anyway I apologize for the unsolicited
60:53 - advice but I hope that's helpful that's
60:55 - helpful saves you like no that is 10 or
60:57 - 15 hours of streaming to basically one
61:00 - or two people which is what everybody
61:02 - starts with stream unless you're like
61:04 - what I was going to do yeah yeah even if
61:06 - you have a big Twitter following it's
61:07 - not necessarily going to translate to a
61:09 - whole lot of people tuning in to watch
61:10 - you on on Twitch uh I mean you may have
61:12 - better luck with it than I did but um so
61:16 - you're also developing this course
61:18 - that's going to teach people how to like
61:20 - is just a general CSS course or is it
61:22 - focused specifically on CSS art it's a
61:25 - CSS course focused on CSS art so it's
61:28 - just going to teach you how to it's
61:30 - going to teach you CSS but with the
61:32 - twist of like while you're creating CSS
61:34 - art because I
61:36 - know sometimes when I'm like learning
61:38 - CSS like they show you things and you're
61:40 - like oh well I don't need to know that
61:41 - right now you know I'm Project based
61:44 - learning pretty much like yeah okay
61:45 - we'll do this you know and so like you
61:48 - have to like make a keyboard and you
61:50 - have to use grid things like that
61:53 - like just uh yeah learn CSS
61:56 - for people that are more like art
61:58 - inclined
61:59 - yeah what are your longer term goals I
62:02 - mean you you've got so much momentum and
62:05 - I mean you literally have CSS artist.com
62:07 - great domain name uh and you You' really
62:09 - like built a niche for yourself as
62:12 - somebody who is exceptionally good at
62:14 - this uh where do you have anything like
62:17 - any goals like five 10 years out I don't
62:19 - want to put you on the spot but like
62:21 - where would you ultimately like to be
62:22 - going uh do you see yourself doing a
62:26 - work indefinitely like like what ises
62:28 - the future hold
62:30 - foro um no yeah I think I think agency
62:33 - life is it like I think I just want to
62:35 - keep getting better at what I do get
62:37 - faster you know that's pretty much my
62:39 - goal I don't want to be a CEO of
62:41 - anything I don't want to own my own
62:42 - company like
62:44 - it's I just want to build fun projects
62:46 - forever and like keep learning how to
62:48 - build cool stuff forever I want to learn
62:50 - 3D rendering um I want to retake Bruno
62:54 - Simon uh 3jf gu course cuz I think
62:57 - that's so cool I just want to like
62:59 - that's it really just get way better at
63:01 - everything and that's what I try to do
63:03 - every day just little by little that's
63:06 - that's it my goal is just be a little
63:08 - bit better yeah and I would absolutely
63:10 - leave it there but let's talk about 3js
63:12 - because it's so amazing it's such a cool
63:14 - tool for for building like 3D
63:17 - potentially interactive experiences in
63:19 - the browser yeah what what Drew you to
63:22 - 3GS and maybe you could describe what
63:24 - the what it does
63:26 - so I mean 3js is really just as someone
63:29 - who likes to look at Art and likes
63:31 - realistic things and stuff 3js what drew
63:33 - me to it was you know realistic actual
63:36 - like 3D things on your computer right
63:39 - now everything is like 2D or is it it's
63:42 - two dimensional yeah one dimensional is
63:44 - just like a single line technically is
63:47 - onedimensional I don't think not
63:49 - anything
63:50 - physical okay some physicists will
63:53 - probably correct me there but yeah yeah
63:55 - although
63:56 - I'm GNA I'm goingon to do a shout out to
63:58 - one-dimensional Pac-Man it's Pac-Man but
64:00 - there's just it's a line and you can
64:03 - it'll be hard to describe it but I'm
64:05 - going to add a link to onedimensional
64:07 - Pac-Man in the show notes and if you
64:10 - click this link you are going to waste
64:11 - at least 10 minutes on this thing this
64:13 - game is so it's amazing it's an
64:15 - engineering like design Marvel that it
64:17 - works and is as addictive as it is but
64:19 - all you do is you tap to turn Pacman
64:21 - around and he's either running from the
64:23 - ghost or he's running towards the ghost
64:24 - after he ate a power pet but such an
64:26 - amazing that sounds so cool that but
64:28 - that is like to my knowledge the first
64:29 - onedimensional game I mean not it's not
64:31 - technically one but your the entire
64:33 - gameplay takes it place on a line um
64:36 - that's cool so two-dimensional 3js back
64:39 - to 3js it's two-dimensional uh you you
64:43 - know all the CD even though they have
64:45 - perceived depth to them uh it's still
64:48 - just a two-dimensional thing you can't
64:49 - like grab you know the Polaroid camera
64:51 - and start looking at it from different
64:52 - angles and stuff using CS I mean you
64:54 - might be able to build 3 stuff in CSS
64:57 - but 3js is designed specifically for 3D
65:01 - rendering and like being able to model
65:03 - things and manipulate things in three
65:05 - dimensions right yes right so it's it
65:08 - looks very cool like it's just it brings
65:11 - I don't know it makes the web so much
65:12 - more exciting and I want to get in on
65:14 - that right like you want to learn all of
65:15 - that I've been learning blender and I
65:17 - want to learn how to make animated
65:19 - videos on that I don't know everything
65:20 - 3js 3D and stuff is just like the
65:24 - coolest thing ever for me right now it
65:25 - is what I'm into um so and I've already
65:30 - taken most of Bruno's course Bruno
65:33 - Simon's 3js Journey amazing incredible
65:36 - course I recommend it to everybody okay
65:38 - I'll link to it mhm but yeah no it's so
65:42 - exciting like the whole thing like the
65:44 - things that you can do with your with
65:47 - your code on like using 3js is
65:50 - incredible and I just I want to be that
65:52 - cool what's the most impressive thing
65:53 - you've seen with 3js
65:56 - uh oh my gosh you I'm going to sound
65:58 - like a commercial but Bruno Simon's uh
66:00 - portfolio website is that the one where
66:01 - you're driving the remote control around
66:03 - yes that is amazing I love that uh
66:05 - you're driving like this RC car around
66:07 - and like knocking over bowling pins and
66:09 - stuff okay I'm definitely I'll link to
66:11 - that instead of his course I think that
66:13 - page links to his course but you know
66:15 - along with onedimensional Pac-Man
66:16 - everybody listening you should spend
66:17 - like five minutes just driving this is
66:19 - the best portfolio I've ever seen ever
66:21 - yeah I mean your portfolio is amazing I
66:24 - would put like if there was AER list
66:26 - yours would be like probably s tier but
66:27 - his is like SS tier I mean it's just
66:30 - yeah his is everything yeah his is
66:33 - creative it's like you're like how did
66:35 - he do it's everything I've everything I
66:38 - admire in web like it's it's amazing
66:41 - yeah really so yeah that's that's what I
66:44 - want to do I just want to comment that
66:46 - it's like so cool that like you went
66:49 - from architecture student kind of like
66:51 - down and out and then now you're this
66:54 - widely recognized
66:56 - like uh popular kind of like artist like
66:59 - you're creating art in a time when it's
67:02 - very hard to break through as an artist
67:03 - like it's like the probably the hardest
67:05 - field to ever go into is creating art
67:08 - right and you're doing it and people are
67:11 - checking out your work and you've also
67:12 - been able to Parlay the same skills that
67:14 - you've been doing to develop this art
67:16 - into working as a software engineer as a
67:19 - senior front-end developer at a
67:22 - consultancy as at a design
67:24 - agency I mean that's so cool that you've
67:26 - been able to
67:28 - like take a second chapter turn over a
67:31 - new leaf and go in a completely
67:32 - different direction and find so much
67:34 - success there and uh yeah I mean like
67:38 - what does that feel like insane I feel
67:41 - like I'm like I've lived two different
67:43 - lives right like if you would have asked
67:45 - me 10 years ago where I would be now I
67:47 - don't know what I would have told you
67:48 - but it would not be this like it's cool
67:51 - and it makes you feel like you know you
67:54 - really can do anything like
67:56 - just you're capable of so much more than
67:58 - you think you are all the time it's it's
68:01 - crazy right like it's just don't be

68:15 - energy person it's it's very hard for me
68:17 - to imagine you as an introvert who would

68:21 - entire week because she's too timid to
68:23 - ask for help but I mean obviously you've
68:26 - come an incredibly long way and uh I
68:29 - just I just want to thank you for coming

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back to the freec coke Camp podcast I'm Quincy Larson teacher and founder of freeco camp.org each week we're bringing you Insight from developers Founders and ambitious people getting into Tech this week we're talking with Cass Moreno the CSS artist herself Cass is a senior frontend developer and she started learning to code at age 28 and has since built a reputation as one of the most Adept CSS artists building entire visuals entire pieces from HTML and CSS Cass welcome to the free Cod Camp podcast hi thank you so much for having me yeah we're thrilled to have you here and we're going to look at some of your art in just a moment and learn about it but first I want to thank the 5,000 I'm sorry 8,5 and2 people who support free Camp each month through donations to our charity so if you want to join them and help make programming like this possible please go to freec camp.org donate and start supporting us today thanks Cass I'm so excited I've been a long time admirer of your work uh I've just seen it around on Twitter other places people have been sharing it and I'm so excited to finally talk with you and learn about it yeah thank you so much yeah thanks it's um it's crazy that people even like know that the art is out there and everything so just to hear that is amazing honestly makes my day every like every time anyone says like they they like CSS art yeah yeah and uh so we're going to be checking out some of the art here on the video version for people who are listening to the audio version of this podcast no worries we're going to verbally describe everything and I've got a show note link it's CSS artist.com you can check out all of cass's work there so Cass why don't you share your screen and we can just dive in and check out some of your art and you can talk about how you made it yeah awesome let's do it okay all right and here we are on CSS artist.com and can yeah go ahead and talk talk us through what you're doing okay yeah so this is my portfolio website I wanted to make sure that it was a little bit weird a little bit um different uh so I have most of my CSS art on here but the one that I'm like most proud of I think is super cool is the um I made the scrolling animation for the uh photo realistic Polaroid drawing that I made using CSS and HTML so it's basically as you scroll you see how the um how the drawing is getting built so you see like the two boxes then you you know more like shading comes in you see Flash the um the lens so you kind of get to see the progression of it uh that's probably my favorite CSS art ever yeah and it's so cool if you scroll down just so we can see the finished product like the the actual like gloss to it the sheen I mean it looks so delicious for lack of a better word it looks like uh almost like a cake matte finish like that that shininess and then of course the iconic Polaroid slot where you pull your your photo out after you've taken the photo everything looks so photo realistic like the uh the glare on the lens for example the the the glass that covers like that aperture that takes the photo yeah yeah everything and the viewfinder I mean so photo realistic and so cool I love it thank you yeah yeah the um it's those little details that you have to spend so much time looking at and they seem so insignificant at first until you like take a step back and look at the whole thing you're like okay no that was definitely worth it to do yeah yeah let's take a look at some of your other work too so if you scroll down on her page you just get like this amazing grid of photorealistic CSS uh art like uh for example maybe we could click on uh that crayon box uh yeah this is one of the first ones that I did and I believe if I'm not mistaken it's a single div wow so the HTML is just div and everything inside is just backgrounds is it like absolutely positioned or like how how do you do that yeah this one's just absolutely positioned with a sing background and uh it's just Stacks linear gradients yeah and it looks like a photo realistic Crayola box without the Crayola logo it's got that those iconic kind of green and yellow box and like the shadow underneath it and like the the some of the colors have like this matte finish to them to them some are a little bit shiny so beautiful yeah thank you yeah this one was I think one of the first ones that I that I really did as soon as you learn how to stack the gradients with the single div like you're Off to the Races yeah let's take a look at that calculator okay yeah this one was probably the hardest one I've ever done easily probably yeah yeah yeah the buttons the buttons oh my gosh those took forever yeah they just have this concaveness like this concavity whatever the word is like you can almost feel like your fingertip kind of like resting on top of it and like the ergonomic of it and then just pressing it in and feeling that that tactile click uh you can imagine like you're just working really fast like kind of a tanky type thing so cool and it it's got kind of that iconic like orange and gray look uh orange and gray I don't know what it is about them like the NES zapper gun like has that like at least in the US it had that orange and gray look so cool looking yeah like nostalgic oh yeah that off white casing that they used to always put Electronics on in yeah yeah so cool and there's a ton of CSS here how many lines of CSS is this this one is oh it's still loading 1,143 lines yeah so it's a lot and it it was the buttons the buttons they look like you could just copy and paste them but they each need to have their own separate like kind of shading and gradience on it um otherwise it just it just didn't look it just didn't look right so yeah that's took forever and that's pretty much what all of the CSS is I mean like that attention to detail thinking like even though this button is only like you know 5 mm to the right of this one it's going to be hit by the Light slightly differently right like the Shadows look slight long yeah yeah yeah so if you look from the buttons like they're just slightly different not too different just slightly different amazing and that game boy let's check out that that that game game boy so nice this is like one of the second generation game boys I think cuz it's like a little bit less boxy yeah yeah yeah this one um oh my gosh I loved Game Boy I used to play like Pokemon all the time on especially like on trips and stuff so this one was super fun to do I loved doing the shading inside of the screen so it looks like it's kind of inset how the game boys actually look I don't know why I thought that was so cool looking and the shading on the on the arrows and the buttons love that too yeah it's super fun to do amazing again anybody listening to the audio version CSS artist.com you can check all these out um these are so cool all right well let's talk about the woman behind the art C Mareno like let's dive into how you got to this level with your CSS skills and uh maybe what I like to do is I like to start at the very beginning as far back as we can go maybe you could talk a little bit about your early days um and um I understand that you were born in Mexico and that you moved to the us when you were six yeah yeah well I was actually I'm I was born in the US uh but I lived in Mexico um until I was six and then I moved back to the US to San Antonio Texas because my parents started a business so um from there you know English became my main language and uh yeah so I ended up just growing up here uh went to high school I was not a great high school student um skipped a lot all of that good stuff all of the fun stuff but uh at the end I decided that I wanted to go to school for architecture yes so um yeah I did that for three whole years and it was so intense like I remember the first day in class like they sit you down in studio and you get there and you're like you know super excited to be here and the teacher like I hope you don't have a boyfriend and I hope you don't have another job because this is going to be your life from now on and I'm just like oh my gosh what did I do yeah yeah so I did that for three years until I was like the thought it it was fun it was uh it taught me a lot like um that's that school was a lot it was uh wow sorry it really pushed a lot of like HandsOn work instead of computer work for architecture so like at the beginning we did a lot of like art projects um learning like art Theory and all of that photorealistic drawings and stuff which I love but the thought of having to do that and like doing architecture for the rest of my life was uh it just it didn't sound like something I want to do so yeah it's a it's a difficult decision but year three almost done I decided that this was not for me like at all I couldn't wasn't like like can you remember what that that moment of you know Revelation maybe it wasn't maybe it was a gradual sinking feeling but like when you finally decided no I'm really not going to do this I'm not going to spend my life being an architect uh like what did you do at that point uh yeah it was it was gradual you like you start getting less excited to go to class you start getting less excited to learn like you don't really want to do the projects anymore and you know it's uh it finally just kind of clicks one day that like my grades were falling it was it was showing everywhere that I just didn't want to do that anymore so I finally was just like okay no like I need to Pivot it's probably not the best idea I may be making the wrong choice but I feel it like in my heart that like this isn't what I'm going to do forever is going to make me happy you make that decision what do you do call my mom all right call my mom and tell her uh and you know try to be real nice about it because she's paying for school and everything and um thankfully she's very kind and she said you know that's fine you have to do something though so like figure something out get a job at least like we'll go from there so yeah thankfully like my mom was super cool about it and she let me just like no harm no foul like it happens you know just be happy so I I did I ended up getting a job at Sprint I didn't know what I was going to do so I just started working which is where I also found out I really didn't want to be a salesperson yeah Sprint is for for anybody outside the US Sprint is a like cell phone carrier uh it's like one of the big they were did they they were they got bought by TMobile oh okay yeah so yeah you used to like was were there the ones with like so quiet like you can hear a pin drop was that their commercial uh no I think I'm not sure actually but there was like there were like some really interesting like 1980s 1990s nothing was more 80s than you know cell phone carrier commercial or 90s I guess because cell phones were pretty can you hear me in the 90s yeah exactly yeah they had like the big can you hear me now I'm walking around like the entire us to check the coverage yeah uh so so you were you decided you didn't want to do sales like but you spent like two years working in it yeah yeah um but it was I was not good at it I was probably the worst sales person I don't it's really hard for me to try to tell someone that they need this like $40 charger when you don't really need the $40 charger let's be real so no I'm not a sales person at all never put me in any sales position because I'm just going to agree with the customer on everything and be like n you don't really need it yeah wow you're you're too empathetic you're too nice to be a salesperson maybe yes that's that's that's my problem I'm too nice so you know we jump straight to college but I I do want to talk a little bit about uh your early days because you you said you were born in San Antonio uh I was born in Laredo Laredo okay that's here in Texas too sorry I'm like not a native yeah that's Texas so it was kind of funny because I was born in Laro but I lived in noo which is Mexico and um so I would actually I went to school in the US too though so I would like drive across the border every day for elementary for like Kinder in elementary school um so that was interesting uh but yeah I did that until I was six and then we moved to the US okay yeah so you already had some English skills and uh you you told me earlier before we started recording like your sister was really big on English and and she was an inspiration for you to really like bulk up on your English skills yeah yeah well because actually most of the people in my school just spoke Spanish even though it's in the US it was predominantly just Spanish and Mexican people so um we didn't really speak any English but my sister was learning it and I remember she was like kind of talking it with her friends and everything and I'm like you know I want to talk that like I want to speak English too like what and so that's what got me to learn just being like that annoying little sister of like I want to do what you're doing yeah so obviously that worked out really well for you because I mean you sound like a native speaker of of course starting early what about the rest of you uh like uh and so you have an older sister and you have a brother as well yeah yeah I have an older sister I have a younger brother so I'm the middle child and then I have two half sisters um they're both in college right now okay cool and what did your brother and sister like ultimately decide to do I'm just curious what we're talking about them like uh yeah are they they are they here in Texas still yeah yeah so my brother went to UT um then back home yeah University of Texas um he studied business there and so now he's working in my parents' business and so is my sister so it's like a whole family business and they're all working except for me okay cool and yeah so so I'm really excited to talk about your relationship with your mom I know that sounds weird to say but like she my understanding is she was absolutely vital to helping you like launch your uh career as a software developer yeah you could talk about like how that came about yeah so I mean one thing to know my mom is a saint okay like uh she let me kind of flail around and try to figure out what I want to do with my life which is not something that a lot of people get a chance to do like they don't you know she's she's very patient with me um but yeah it was towards the end of my my nonsuccessful tenure at Sprint that she was like hey I need a website for the business I need a new one because theirs was super old she's like you're not doing anything right so like why don't you try to figure this out and she was right I wasn't so I'm like okay yeah that actually sounds like something fun like something I could just dive into and um from there yeah I started reading about WordPress cuz that's what her site was on and then I started like okay so then I need theme okay what's the most popular theme cool so how do I change this header like and then it just snowballed into like oh okay so I should probably like look at this course and then like oh free code camp and then like oh you D me and it just never ended and yeah it was just quite the quite the beginning right it just snowballs once you start you just keep getting more curious about everything else yeah and maybe you can talk about like that process of building that project WordPress of course being this giant ecosystem of plugins and templates and things like that like how did you start out what was the what was the first uh because this is really cool it's like project oriented learning you already have a stakeholder right your mom and yeah of course nobody wants to disappoint their mom so you're probably working really hard to get this done well yeah yeah after dropping out of college and leaving Sprint I definitely needed this to be like a thing that she's like oh thank you like you know I wanted to help her at this point because she's helped me so much so yeah I spent a lot of time on this trying to make sure it's perfect like I found the you know the perfect theme and then I joined the theme groups but that wasn't enough because like what if I want to change something very specifically and like look at all of these other cool sites I want to do what they do like so um I started taking CSS courses and then I'm like oh but if I want to do this you need to learn JavaScript what's that oh my gosh that looks really difficult um and so yeah you just kind of start with that and so the process was just yeah iterations and iterations of just getting better and like I'd be I remember just being at home at night next to my well now husband and just being like look babe I I changed the header to this website like the color was black and now it's red like I was so excited and he was like there just like yeah that's so cool and so then I would show my mom like and so yeah it's we just kept iterating where I would like you know compare their websites see what they do like what is my mom trying to do like it just it was a lot of learning like like you said project oriented learning is incredible because you already you're not like lost you you have like a clear set of things that you need to get done and you just kind of you just jump right in yeah and so you eventually build this this website for your mom is is it still live today is it is it a WordPress no no yeah that was a while ago they already took that one down okay but I mean nothing lasts forever in on on the web as Mark Mark Zuckerberg says like you know when uh you know you can find like ancient ruins of like past civilizations but on the web nothing is left it's just like yeah it's as though nothing were even there sorry it's kind of like a menacing Mark Zuckerberg no no that's true though like even like trying to show clients past work is like uh I can't really show this to you because it's not live anymore but I promise it was cool yeah exactly uh maybe some maybe it's on the internet archive somewhere so um so you build this site and like what happens next like does that kind of like does that serve as a a win that like helps push you to continue learn the win that I needed the the win that I really really needed because I didn't know how bad it like I was I didn't realize how bad I was feeling about myself cuz I'm like no architecture no sales like what am I doing everyone around me was you know all my friends were doing really really great things and I'm just sitting here so that was my way yeah and you're like 28 years old at this point approximately right yeah yeah so so just to put that in perspective like you probably have lots of friends who went to architecture school who are now working at like big contractors or developers or something like right like so a lot of your peer group is like Way Beyond where you were at that time and I hope that doesn't sound insensitive for me to say that because I was not at all like to some extent learning the code at age 31 right so but here you are in a completely different field like getting things done and and this this has to be like a huge win in terms of like motivation and like selfperception like I can actually get things done right yeah yeah it was I remember the feeling it was one of the first times in a long time that I felt like I wanted to do something and I actually did it like and it was hard and I didn't know how to do it at first but I did it like it it really motivates you to be like anything that comes your way now like I could probably figure it out if I could figure that out from nothing yeah so what do you do next okay so next um she so that was like her actual like front end part of the website um she needed something that kept like inventory and stuff and like you had to it's been a while but you had to you know upload prices somewhere and then like view the prices so like basically just like a a rest op so I went and I started learning like full stack um that was interesting and fun it was It was kind of it was doing that by yourself and being like an introvert is really hard because I don't want like I didn't want to reach out to anyone I didn't want to ask anyone any questions like I don't know any web developers like what so I just I really for the longest time I just kind of kept to myself I remember one problem took me like a week to figure out cuz I refused to like ask anyone or like I think I asked something on stack Overflow once and I got downvoted immediately so like just crazy so I'm like okay I'm not doing that anymore so um yeah I I I created this this little app that it's it's super simple but it allows them to upload some pricing and then like view the pricing later and then add their products and whatnot so that is not up anymore either but it was a great learning experience and um my mom was actually proud of me yeah well even though your mom was pretty proud of you like I know I know you've had to uh endure a lot of financial hardship uh during this process cuz I mean you're like a university drop out uh you you left your job at Sprint and you know maybe your mom was compensating you in any way in some way but like what were you doing were you like living with your family at this point or how were you getting by um yeah so I was just living with my boyfriend and I was not really getting by too well cuz I didn't actually have a job I was just helping my mom with this but she wasn't really paying me too much she was just helping me here and there but it wasn't like an actual job that paid you a lot like I I think I was you know she'd give me like $300 a week or something which again added to my feeling of just like what am I doing here like what is going on um yeah I was so broke living with my boyfriend like he had a parttime job I just I felt almost lost but like really excited too just like maybe I could learn to do this maybe I can actually like become a developer but yeah it was it was very difficult for a while um I remember my car my car was so old at the time like and Rusty um I woke up one day I went outside to my car and I had a ticket because they said it was like no abandoned cars on the street and it wasn't abandoned it just looked old cuz I just didn't have any money to get another one but like oh my gosh like that was the moment where I was just like freaked out I was like I can't even pay a $40 ticket cuz my car looks old what am I doing so that was like I don't even want to say low point because it wasn't cuz I was also really excited about like web dead but I was pretty low like something needs to happen like right now I need to figure something out yeah this is not sustainable like and I need a new car cuz the AC in mine did not work and Texas is not forgiving when it comes to that summer yeah so um what did you do like like did did your financial hardship kind of like apply additional pressure did it help you kind of get over some of your introversion start asking people for help how did you meet other developers what did you do from there okay yeah so that definitely not even that helped me get over my intro version like I was still dead set on I am not contacting anyone which for anyone listening by the way just reach out like it's so much easier and I love it when people reach out and I love talking to people and I love having conversations with developers that have questions like I don't know why I didn't didn't do it just do it um but yeah that definitely was just like I needed to do something so I started applying like I thought maybe I'm ready like maybe I can apply and get like an actual coding job like a professional job um that was that was an experience your first trying to apply to your first professional job as a developer as a selftaught developer oh my gosh as an introverted selftaught developer who's also very desperate for something anything was crazy I um I went through like three or four interviews at different companies like didn't even pass the first screening um and I don't even know how this happened honestly like I one day late at night it was like 1200 at night I was like three glasses of wine in playing video games um and I looked at LinkedIn and there was this one post like for a job it wasn't even web developer it was web content administrator and I was like that sounds great like it has it's like kind of Webby you know and I know kind of Webby like so I applied and 10 minutes later the recruiter responded like oh this is great like let's talk tomorrow and that was like the first time that I was like I was I put my glass down I was like oh my gosh okay okay maybe maybe so then the next day I talked to the recruiter she was wonderful like so incredibly kind and just passed me on to the manager and somehow like she gave me this I remember the takehome was the PSD file and I had to code it and I was so scared of like asking questions or anything I remember like can I use a framework can I use bootstrap like I was just thinking all these things but I don't want to ask because I don't ask questions right yeah so um yeah I just coded it CSS whatever but I got it she called me and gave me the job and I I'm still friends with that manager to this day like you're going to have a a call next week I think um yeah but yeah they gave me a shot they took a chance on me and were like you don't have any experience really but like yeah it was I mean if you can do the work you can do the work right that was yeah that was the win that I needed like that that right there that job like it was everything right like they the pay was awful but this large mortgage company like allowed me to like go kind of nuts too right like uh they had like contest sites which were super fun like you know we want to do a cool like um Lottery and so I was like oh okay you want to do like a lottery I'm like okay well what if you get like realistic looking Lottery balls and then what if you have like a screen where they you know flip and then the lottery number comes out then what if you drop it down this like realistic looking little tube and then they like drop down and then confetti comes out and all this really cool stuff stuff and they were like yeah if you can do it just do it and I couldn't but I figured it out like it was all those like cool ideas that you just need someone to be like yeah go nuts when you get excited about something and then that's where you learn right like yeah well it's cool first of all that you're like basically making all this work for yourself a lot of people who are lazy might just be like oh sure good enough but you're like no it could do you see the potential for what this project could be and you're like let's let's go all the way with this project yeah yeah and it's like it's a forgettable project like it was just for that year but it was super fun to do um there was another one where they had like a Halloween contest and I thought what if we make this look old school and so I had like an old school looking TV that I put like a screen over so it looks like we're on the screen and then little I made little CSS Polaroids and like did a cute little I don't know it's so much fun to just do like weird cute little things that people are just like oh that's that's creative that's weird yeah yeah well so what is it like settling in cuz you I mean you mentioned you're like hardcore introvert like afraid to ask people questions willing to toil for an entire week on a problem rather than just asking for help like did you have to report to an office like like who were you working with um I was yeah so I actually worked at an office um and the manager above me she was who I reported directly to it's just me her and this one other girl that were the U developers not really Developers there was one other developer and he was really he was way better than both of us but um pretty much it was just me reporting to my manager and so she was she she's a developer she was selftaught as well um so yeah she she helps me out a lot she gave me a bunch of ideas on things to do and um you know I I remember like freaking out I would have like a bunch of question she like basically calmed me down and told me like you can ask questions like it's not you know or she would she was very patient with me at first because I freak out very easily as well since I don't want to ask questions like I don't know if I'm doing the right thing which I need to just ask if I'm doing the right this so like it's just it's a lot of patience when you're a manager with the first time like Stu like not student with the selftaught firsttime job she was very kind I got very lucky very lucky yeah and I'm thrilled that it worked out well and you and you kind of stayed uh in that uh mortgage space which let's talk about that for a second because I think a lot of people Envision oh I'm going to work at Google or I'm going to work at you know Microsoft or one of these big prominent tech companies that that's their eventual goal and what I always tell people is twothirds of all Developer jobs are outside of what we conventionally think of as Tech right they're they're working at like you know an automotive company or uh Hospital chain or any number of different types of uh Industries right everybody needs developers everybody's trying to push push things to the software developer or to the software layer everybody's trying to figure out uh ways that they can better reach customers through technology things like that right so right yeah maybe you could talk a little bit about that like because you uh up until relatively recently you were working in kind of like the the mortgage industry right yeah yeah and honestly like I for just starting out like I knew that I wasn't ever going to get into like Google or LinkedIn or and Netflix whatever so I you know go for the easier jobs and everything but even I don't know yeah like you said the most of the tech jobs are not in those companies they're and just like what sounds almost like boring companies but it's they're great jobs they're a lot of fun you get to do a lot of things like as long as you have a good manager and good working environment like you're Off to the Races it's great and it's a lot of fun yeah some of the the I mean just because it's like an industry that's like really old doesn't mean there's not really exciting work to be done in that field and a lot of those companies are you know the jobs are a lot more stable and um it can be a lot more like better work life balance and things like that then going to some crazy like Silicon Valley like Tech startup where they expect you to work like all day every day and like yeah exactly yeah like and you know someone at Google isn't going to let me go nuts on a landing page for a lottery like for fun you know but you can do that at companies that aren't only like tech tech yeah you know you can go and just do fun weird crazy things at different companies and it sounds like you were working on a pretty small team you you said there were just a couple other developers yeah uh and I always tell people like working on a small team gives you the ability to do a lot of everything would you agree with that sentiment yeah absolutely yeah you kind of have to wear a bunch of hats because it's the team is so small yeah um and you know you kind of grow and learn together which is a great part of being in a small team yeah so that first couple years of working in Tech like what what were some of and when I say working in Tech we just established it's a it's a mortgage company but working as a developer sometimes I use working in Tech and working as a developer synonymously um but uh what was that like like what were were there any like standout moments in your kind of progression as a developer where you felt like you just unlocked some entire new aspect of your brain that you didn't know existed yeah yeah like just any kind of like the creativity idea like the um creating the little realistic balls you're like oh my gosh okay so I could do that and then I learn illustrator and then I can bring that SVG into into code and then animate that with JavaScript like what yeah I didn't even know I could do that like you just yeah that you unlocked um I remember we read about some sort of uh the accessibility like the lawsuits and everything that was all starting when I first started there uh we started that kind of unlocked everything so I was like I didn't know anything about accessibility really so I started reading more and then we like we uh went back and like made thousands of landing pages that we have for that company just like accessible so that like unlocked something else like oh my gosh like people you know like need people that aren't me that need to like read this everyone needs to be able to like learn and read this so that that was great too like yeah the you know the the late 2010s whatever that decade is called like that was really a Renaissance for accessibility we're still feeling that today like uh there there's so many different websites and and sub pages and everything that can be gone through and made accessible and it's like yeah it's it's not that much work and it makes all the difference for so many people uh I think something like 15% of people on earth live with a disability right um so yeah it sounds like really important impactful work so you were able to like sit down and like okay today I'm making these pages exess Bill and like did that was that a good feeling like were you able to like what was your mom thinking this entire time I guess curious because she's seen her daughter go from you know College Dropout who's like you know getting tickets because her car is too uh old and Rusty old and Rusty uh and you know like like kind of like uh living a hand to mouth existence so to speak and now she's going out there and having such an impact helping uh improve these websites and yeah like what did she ever talk with you about that oh yeah yeah I mean I tell my mom everything so she was very excited for me like anything cool that I did or something I sent her I mean like I even I even called her when I won like this Call of Duty war zone game like I she I tell her like everything right like so yeah no she was proud she's aware like she's like I didn't even know you can do that I remember even my sister she was giving birth and I was in the hospital like learning with my laptop like oh okay so I could move this here and this that because you know giving birth takes forever so I'm just sitting there in the waiting room so and I'm like look Mom I remember showing her like all these like columns I did or something like that and she's like that's great Cass yeah but no she was very excited she was very very proud of me like very just very happy yeah to just see me like settle down a little bit Yeah and speaking of settling down if you don't mind me asking like like you recently changed your last name which is why on your landing page it said Cass Sanchez but now you're cast change that yeah yeah maybe you can talk about about that congratulations on uh marrying sounds like your longtime boyfriend yeah yeah that was great he um he's been wonderful he's supported me through the whole like coding Journey like it's uh he paid off my $40 ticket for me when I was when I was real down in the dumps um yeah it's it's been great it there's nothing like having a supportive spouse when you're trying to learn and like pivot into something completely different like when he met me I didn't even have a job and I didn't know what I was doing and he still was just like yeah I like her yeah so that was great like you know you like he likes you for you so that's great um then he uh he his job got moved to Houston so I had to move to Houston with him so I moved to a different part of the mortgage company to the different office but that's kind of where everything changed too because that's when I was like okay so maybe you know it just once you move cities you kind of start like taking like looking at your life and being like okay I think I can I think I'm like ready you know to do something a little bit bigger than what what this is like I want to I want to move on and my husband was amazing about everything just like yeah like you should like I think you're great like as a husband does but um yeah I think that that move if it weren't for him and that whole move and everything I don't I'm not even sure where I would where I would be like yeah he helps me a lot and without him I don't I wouldn't even be a developer yeah yeah wow well um gooders to him for uh being so supportive that that's really chill my wife was extremely supportive when me as like a 31y old man hey I'm going to stop being a School director I'm going to learn the code she was super she had and she practically as a as an American she had insurance through her company so I had health insurance coverage even though I was just you know heads down for like nine months learning the code while I was at the library and stuff so um yeah that's super chill that he was there uh to support you and um it not just emotionally but like with your your $40 ticket so yeah maybe we can talk about this new Awakening when you arrive in Houston Houston is one of the biggest cities in the United States uh it's like the Metroplex that the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex and and the Houston Metroplex they're they're like the two biggest parts of Texas which is the second biggest state right behind California in terms of population uh they're even though they're both in Texas they're pretty far away from from each other like it takes me about 4 hours to drive down to Houston from here maybe you could talk about what it was like arriving in this big city is this the biggest city you've ever lived in yeah yeah it is so I mean we and we moved to like a really nice little apartment like in the middle of like the heights so it was just like bustling stuff everywhere like bars restaurants like it was so cool to see all that cuz we didn't have that before we I'd never like lived in like a really cool part of a city you know so it was fun and it was fun seeing like all these people like you know you like successful people around you like it just helps you like you know talk to people like neighbors and stuff just like seeing what they're doing how hard they're working like it it is kind of an Awakening like just being just getting taken out of your comfort zone is an Awakening no matter what you do right like it's so it was just it was a huge inspiration that like I want to I now that I'm like more comfortable with change I want to I want to do more I want to like do a lot more actually so yeah and I was thinking like okay like how do I even improve my code how do I get better like I need to get better like it was I I think I got a little bit complacent at the mortgage company um but that move really helped with that so I was like maybe I'll start like a 100 days of code I've seen that like on Twitter where I uh I started a account like 10 years ago and it was just there I was like okay maybe and then the pandemic hit yeah and that's what like we all started working from home so I had even more time in the day so I really like I was like I'll just do 100 days of code and I started that and I started posting I had five followers like I was just posting yes and then also sending it to my mother um but she wasn't going to join Twitter so it's just five followers and my mom on the side uh and yeah it just like every day I was just striving to just get a little bit better like a little bit better just uh you know it started off with like how to do like a little falling down animation in sequence like a make a word fall down like the letters like hit each other yeah you know things like that like super silly things like I got really into loading animations just to learn animations like and the more I posted the more like I saw people were like oh that's cool that's cool and I'm like oh my gosh other people think that's cool and so then I got inspired looking at other people's code and it just oh my gosh it gets so exciting once you like finally start talking to other people like that that opened up everything like Twitter just like I was like whoa like everyone is so talented 100 days of code Twitter like I mean you've got 50,000 followers now so you literally grew your following by 10,000 times in this time uh posting uh about yeah just posting things that I make that I think are kind of cool like that's it yeah and that I mean that's the secret like there's so much authenticity when I like scroll through your Twitter feed and as like you're just being you you're You're Building you're using your skills to build things that you think are interesting uh let's talk about like agency life like working at an agency so you're no longer at a mortgage company now you're working at a kind of like Dev consultancy agency doing work probably for a lot of different companies can you talk about that a little bit yeah it's so much fun to work at an agency like I don't I even told my husband recently like I don't think I could see myself moving to like another corporate job like that cuz agency like you you get to work on everything like you know it's not just one project and you're improving it forever or whatever it's new projects new projects like can you do this I don't know how but we'll figure it out like it's so much fun it's chaotic agency life is so chaotic and it's like you have to wear so many hats CU you're not a big corporate company you're just an agency so like oh you need to figure out how to do reports on Google analytics okay like I guess we'll figure this out um or oh you need X Y and Z like okay we're going to figure out how to do that or you need like a video platform you know so agency life is just really really fun like if you want to ever level up like crazy it's it's going to be in my opinion at an agency yeah and I've heard the same from so many people that work at agencies like you just get to work on so many more projects uh if you work at a big company that might stick you in a department and you just work on that you know code base for years you know um but you're I mean how many different projects are you taking on a year would you say if you were to estimate oh my gosh probably like probably like 15 or so 15 projects a year that you're touching yeah yeah yeah and then like a lot of them a lot of projects I'm also just like keeping up with and adding to but like new projects new things yeah about 15 I'd say yeah and you're you're able to work remotely yeah yeah most of my all of my coworkers are in seatt and I'm the only one in Texas cuz they said oh it's the pandemic we'll hire someone from out of state yeah I just met them like a month ago in real life for the first time so that's exciting that's cool yeah uh yeah a lot of tech up in Seattle uh and like a lot of you know big customers and stuff so it makes sense that they'd be out there um but that's that's so cool that you know you can live in Houston of course uh you know being a Texan growing up here I used to live in Houston when I was a kid actually uh I probably left Houston because I'm a bit older than you I was probably not living in Houston uh obviously not now but I think I lived there till I was like six or wait I lived there from like age five to like age 10 I think so I lived there for five years yeah and that was my kind of Texas upbringing and my first um encounter with the humidity and the heat of it's insane like you don't think it's going to be that bad and it's like way worse than you could ever imagine yeah especially for someone with curly hair oh my gosh so I'm really excited to learn a little bit more about lessons you've learned from this because overcoming to some extent your introversion and uh being able to get things done on teams working with clients um of course learning the code really well um not just front end development but like going extremely deep on CSS specifically that's so cool what are some observations that you have about your journey that like you think would be like super actionable for someone like what advice would you send back in time to yourself well yeah great question a like um 100% like main one is ask for help when you're stuck because otherwise you're going to spend so much unnecessary time just being stuck when you don't actually have to be and people are a lot nicer than you think they are yeah um anyone needs anything I'm happy to like help always Reach Out me I'm totally here um what else let's see 100 days of code 100 just consistency pretty much is what it is right like you can spend like 3 hours learning how to do something and then you don't touch it again you're going to forget yeah that was a huge deal for me that was something that like feels obvious but I needed to learn like 17 times before I finally got it so really it's just the consistency sharing your code is important to me I mean a lot of people probably don't think it's a good idea maybe you don't want to share on social media maybe you know you're scared to post But like everyone again is so kind and it's fun to get feedback maybe you learn something you can do better um it's just it's very important to like talk to other developers just get out of your box a little bit and just learn you know and if you think something looks cool try to figure out how to do it try to like Decon deconstruct it see how they do that like just being curious when you feel yourself getting complacent and like try to like you know see that that's like a feeling and that's what you're doing like try to recognize it and try to Pivot a little bit from that but also don't get burned out because I've done that so many times that yeah it's like a habit we talk about that real quick because I mean that like that's the biggest occupational hazard other than like repetitive stress injury or eye strain or uh some people uh I know have got like vertigo from staring at a screen too much and things like that which is very debilitating but like burnout is very real and like a lot of people that I've talked to have gone through periods of burnout can when was the I I guess the first time you started feeling burned out and what did that feel like um the first time was when I started posting a lot on social media that I felt like I should probably keep posting I should make I should keep making more CSS art like you kind of start getting in this mode that you're like I need to keep learning I need to keep posting like you kind of start moving into like robotic mode almost um and then I started getting less excited I started getting more tired I started dreading opening up social media like that's when I was like uh oh like this what am I doing but I'm so stubborn that I just kind of try to push through it and then you burn out yeah um and I actually just came out of a burnout recently too because I don't when I get an idea in my head I get so excited I get just so hyped I want to do it night and day like wake up go to sleep do it and then I just just burned myself out so I've kind of resigned myself to the fact that I'm oh sorry that I'm a kind of person that like I'm like a dog with a bone and then once I finish the bone I need like a month break of like extracurriculars and then I can go back yeah I'm so I'm taking so many notes uh because I I feel your description of like you know that that kind of you get into production mode where you're like I've got to ship this and I you know and probably at the same time you know social media is like you see those numbers climb there's uh Jeff Atwood founder of sty overflow whom I've interviewed on uh the uh freeing podcast previously he he has a great saying he says the moment you put a number next to somebody's face that's where like problems happen because people are going to try to make that number go up right and yeah it's it's like a game yeah yeah and I mean you've been so amazing at that game but at the same time it can it can feel like a grind like and it can almost feel like the the the people that are actually like saying kind things and everything that kind of gets abstracted away like people are saying nice things but my number's not going up as fast as it used to or something like that or yeah or like what what's wrong like I just worked really hard on this I published it like have you ever published uh a new piece of art and just felt like it wasn't as well received as your like previous work oh yeah yeah and that's when I have to like step back and be like it's not even it's not even about that like it's just that I get so sad that other people aren't as excited as I am about it but that's okay because like I'm not as excited about everything either it's just like it stings a little bit it stings the heart a little bit after like five hours of working on something yeah like I've written more than 500 articles for like the free C Camp publication and like there was this one that I spent like three days on I worked so hard on it and I was like so proud of it and I published it in like very few people read I mean it was still like you know I feel guilty even saying like oh only a few th000 people read this article but still you know is like you kind of get like acclimated to success and anything that's not like absolute unadulterated success feels like a step down and yeah that definitely kind of like made me question should I really work this hard on a single article if like all of them but obviously like when looking at your art it's clear that you spend a great deal of time on these H how do you do it how do you how do you push forward you know meticulously crafting these pieces uh like is there ever a voice in your head like H people aren't going to like this as much do do you have like a critical voice in your head ever no not when I start it when I start it I like I said dog with the bone I am in it and I'm going to finish this because I'm going to finish this I don't care if this looks weird or hard like I'm going to finish this and then it's not until after that I get like a little hangover like what did I just do or is anyone even going to like this yeah why did I just spend eight hours on this yeah it's it's not during it's after Okay so so that's I mean that's a really con convenient way for your mind to work because for me I'm always doubting things before I even start or as I'm doing it I'm like St to doubt like uh for example like with my music like I created the soundtrack for The learn to code RPG and the whole time like are people going to just think this is janky like is it going to sound amateurish and uh like I was doubting myself the entire time uh so it I would love to have it sounds like a superpower to be able to like just power through and only after you finish working so hard on something do you start to doubt but the work is already done so it's it's like you're not really discourage once the work is already done you just have to like yeah that's that's a really cool Quirk see but that's different though from the from the music because the the art I already know what it needs to look like I know what the endgame is the music you need to be creative and be like okay I have to do this I have to do that the art is already written for like I I just I know I see it and I have to make sure it looks like that at the end so so how does what is your process like so you identify some sort of object or some sort of like maybe you can walk an electronic yeah yeah just walk us through an entire project yeah okay so like I start getting kind of the itch of like okay I kind of want to draw something do creative okay so I start Pinterest um it's already totally geared to like me so it shows me a bunch of electronics with really nice like edges and stuff that um would be easy to draw with CSS art so I just scroll open up a bunch of tabs and then after I have like 10 open I go through those and I'm like okay this one so then I keep that tab open and I put it as a background image on my code and then I just kind of outline the shape of it so that I know the shapes the main shapes are right and then after that I'm off to the races I start with just any little thing that I think is like the easiest thing to start with and from there you just you just go yeah and so so do you do like the big like I mean when you scroll through your landing page it shows like the big squares appear first and then you kind of go through and you add fine details maybe you'll zoom in and really focus on like the flash component and you'll spend a whole lot of time on that and then you'll go do the viewfinder and then you'll do like the lens like how do you because I've seen people draw like I don't I can't draw for the damn but like they'll often like it almost seems arbitrary what they're focused on like they just jump around almost yeah is it so it's just like a yeah it's arbitrary for me it's just whatever looks like I'm going to that's that's what I feel like I'm going to do right now I'm going to just do that and I'm going to focus on it so like I think I did the flash first or I I'm pretty sure it's the flash I'm not very familiar with camera Parts but the flash part um and so I'm like okay I'm going to make this perfect and then I'm like okay that looks good but now it's just like squares and a flash a really nice looking Flash and so then you just move on to the next thing and then the next thing um and then the logo is always the last thing to go on but yeah yeah and I guess how would you recommend somebody if they want to create CSS art like you do if they want to try to create photo realistic images using CSS what would be some tips if somebody let's say that somebody has like a free weekend and they're like I want to get better at CSS and I'm going to use this project I'm going to like you have a a photo real istic Xbox controller right like somebody gets a they they find a photo of an Xbox or maybe like uh some new synthesizer module or something like that that they they just find online and this is like this is a beautiful you know aesthetic piece of hardware and I or or their favorite mechanical keyboard or something they want to recreate that in CSS what would be your advice to getting started with that process and getting better at CSS art yeah so my advice would be for first things first like try to create create something with a single div like learn how to stack backgrounds that's it like that's once you can make like a pretty simple image and you can learn how backgrounds can stack on top of each other how the linear gradients can stack or radial um after that it's pretty simple it's I mean I don't want to say simple but like it's it's tedious but it's simple like it's just very detail oriented but once you figure out how the gradient work in a background and how positioning Works you're you're pretty good it's just starting off like really what I started off with was just single divs and stacking the backgrounds to make something I I think my first one was a window and I just made the window like shiny and I was like oh my gosh and then I was like What if I add a ledge okay let me stock this background and then I can move the background and I can make it be just like x height in the same div and it's a ledge now like it's just that moment that you're just like okay so that's how you do it and then yeah you're good from there really it it looks a lot harder because it than it is because there's so much code but it's it's really not it's the same properties over and over again and it's a lot of fun yeah well are there any projects that you're working on right now and I mean you're working fulltime you know you you got like your own personal life and stuff but like do you have any projects that uh you're like I can't wait to build this you don't have to spoil what they're going to be but do you do you have anything that you're getting ready to start um yeah so I I'm working on a CSS course that's uh it took a little bit of a break because of the whole burnout thing um but I I also want to start uh streaming more code um I'm just I'm not sure 100% on how that would work I want to I want to stream CSS art but it takes so long to do that I'm not sure like if that's even a good idea so like that's kind of running around in my head if anyone has any ideas I want to do with that let me know but um that's yeah definitely I want to do more YouTube videos uh and articles I really want to write articles I never write articles we would love to publish some of your articles on uh the free cocam publication if at some point you're interested in in yeah that would be great like a getting started to CSS art article I think would be solid that would be amazing I'd love to publicize that to the community um one thing like this is some unsolicited advice one thing you might consider doing is just keeping your screen recorder going while you're working and then you have this artifact like a recording of you building an entire project and then you could always just speed that up a little bit if it's slow and uh then you you could you know have like a 20x speed because there have been some really cool videos where people are like building uis and stuff and they'll be jumping back and forth from their Editor to the the browser to see what it looks like and stuff and you could just speed that up and put that with some like copyright free music or some like stream okay music and you can put that out that might be a really good way of like testing the water because live streaming is a commitment I spent like a year or two streaming on Twitch and it was so much work compared to like just recording like a a synchronous video and editing it publishing it yeah so I'm not trying to turn anybody off from streaming but it's very hard to get people to like actually watch your stream because they have to be free at that exact moment they have to be like in a place where they're like oh I'm going to sit down I'm going to watch somebody and at the same time twitch has like terrible discoverability you can stream on YouTube but people don't really look at YouTube as like oh I'm streaming on YouTube people think of twitch and twitch doesn't really have a Cate they've got like just chatting they've got like maybe an art category but they don't really have an a category for coding despite the fact that the developer community's been asking for this forever right um oh interesting and that would make a huge difference in terms of discoverability so my humble advice to anybody who's considering streaming like start with YouTube and start with like asynchronously recorded videos where you can edit them and make them more Punchy and stuff it's so much easier to get people to watch a YouTube video that they can watch at any time than to try to get people to tune in at a very specific time to watch you do that and the fact that you can speed it up even if it's not that exciting everything's exciting if you make it fast enough right I agree I agree I need to watch everything faster listen to everything faster like yeah yeah so anyway I apologize for the unsolicited advice but I hope that's helpful that's helpful saves you like no that is 10 or 15 hours of streaming to basically one or two people which is what everybody starts with stream unless you're like what I was going to do yeah yeah even if you have a big Twitter following it's not necessarily going to translate to a whole lot of people tuning in to watch you on on Twitch uh I mean you may have better luck with it than I did but um so you're also developing this course that's going to teach people how to like is just a general CSS course or is it focused specifically on CSS art it's a CSS course focused on CSS art so it's just going to teach you how to it's going to teach you CSS but with the twist of like while you're creating CSS art because I know sometimes when I'm like learning CSS like they show you things and you're like oh well I don't need to know that right now you know I'm Project based learning pretty much like yeah okay we'll do this you know and so like you have to like make a keyboard and you have to use grid things like that like just uh yeah learn CSS for people that are more like art inclined yeah what are your longer term goals I mean you you've got so much momentum and I mean you literally have CSS artist.com great domain name uh and you You' really like built a niche for yourself as somebody who is exceptionally good at this uh where do you have anything like any goals like five 10 years out I don't want to put you on the spot but like where would you ultimately like to be going uh do you see yourself doing a work indefinitely like like what ises the future hold foro um no yeah I think I think agency life is it like I think I just want to keep getting better at what I do get faster you know that's pretty much my goal I don't want to be a CEO of anything I don't want to own my own company like it's I just want to build fun projects forever and like keep learning how to build cool stuff forever I want to learn 3D rendering um I want to retake Bruno Simon uh 3jf gu course cuz I think that's so cool I just want to like that's it really just get way better at everything and that's what I try to do every day just little by little that's that's it my goal is just be a little bit better yeah and I would absolutely leave it there but let's talk about 3js because it's so amazing it's such a cool tool for for building like 3D potentially interactive experiences in the browser yeah what what Drew you to 3GS and maybe you could describe what the what it does so I mean 3js is really just as someone who likes to look at Art and likes realistic things and stuff 3js what drew me to it was you know realistic actual like 3D things on your computer right now everything is like 2D or is it it's two dimensional yeah one dimensional is just like a single line technically is onedimensional I don't think not anything physical okay some physicists will probably correct me there but yeah yeah although I'm GNA I'm goingon to do a shout out to onedimensional PacMan it's PacMan but there's just it's a line and you can it'll be hard to describe it but I'm going to add a link to onedimensional PacMan in the show notes and if you click this link you are going to waste at least 10 minutes on this thing this game is so it's amazing it's an engineering like design Marvel that it works and is as addictive as it is but all you do is you tap to turn Pacman around and he's either running from the ghost or he's running towards the ghost after he ate a power pet but such an amazing that sounds so cool that but that is like to my knowledge the first onedimensional game I mean not it's not technically one but your the entire gameplay takes it place on a line um that's cool so twodimensional 3js back to 3js it's twodimensional uh you you know all the CD even though they have perceived depth to them uh it's still just a twodimensional thing you can't like grab you know the Polaroid camera and start looking at it from different angles and stuff using CS I mean you might be able to build 3 stuff in CSS but 3js is designed specifically for 3D rendering and like being able to model things and manipulate things in three dimensions right yes right so it's it looks very cool like it's just it brings I don't know it makes the web so much more exciting and I want to get in on that right like you want to learn all of that I've been learning blender and I want to learn how to make animated videos on that I don't know everything 3js 3D and stuff is just like the coolest thing ever for me right now it is what I'm into um so and I've already taken most of Bruno's course Bruno Simon's 3js Journey amazing incredible course I recommend it to everybody okay I'll link to it mhm but yeah no it's so exciting like the whole thing like the things that you can do with your with your code on like using 3js is incredible and I just I want to be that cool what's the most impressive thing you've seen with 3js uh oh my gosh you I'm going to sound like a commercial but Bruno Simon's uh portfolio website is that the one where you're driving the remote control around yes that is amazing I love that uh you're driving like this RC car around and like knocking over bowling pins and stuff okay I'm definitely I'll link to that instead of his course I think that page links to his course but you know along with onedimensional PacMan everybody listening you should spend like five minutes just driving this is the best portfolio I've ever seen ever yeah I mean your portfolio is amazing I would put like if there was AER list yours would be like probably s tier but his is like SS tier I mean it's just yeah his is everything yeah his is creative it's like you're like how did he do it's everything I've everything I admire in web like it's it's amazing yeah really so yeah that's that's what I want to do I just want to comment that it's like so cool that like you went from architecture student kind of like down and out and then now you're this widely recognized like uh popular kind of like artist like you're creating art in a time when it's very hard to break through as an artist like it's like the probably the hardest field to ever go into is creating art right and you're doing it and people are checking out your work and you've also been able to Parlay the same skills that you've been doing to develop this art into working as a software engineer as a senior frontend developer at a consultancy as at a design agency I mean that's so cool that you've been able to like take a second chapter turn over a new leaf and go in a completely different direction and find so much success there and uh yeah I mean like what does that feel like insane I feel like I'm like I've lived two different lives right like if you would have asked me 10 years ago where I would be now I don't know what I would have told you but it would not be this like it's cool and it makes you feel like you know you really can do anything like just you're capable of so much more than you think you are all the time it's it's crazy right like it's just don't be complacent like it's it's insane really it feels great like I it's like a breath of fresh air yeah well it's been such a blast talking with you like Cass you're just like such an enthusiastic like high energy person it's it's very hard for me to imagine you as an introvert who would work on an engineering problem for an entire week because she's too timid to ask for help but I mean obviously you've come an incredibly long way and uh I just I just want to thank you for coming on the podcast and inspiring uh inspiring me and inspiring the many people who are looking to get into software development who needed you in as a role model and have now found you as a role model thank you so much honestly hearing that from you is everything and I cannot wait till tell my mom like she's going to die well if she's listening to this what's your mom's name Rosie Rosie from the free Camp Community I hope you have a fantastic day and your daughter is amazing she's going to love that I'm very excited yeah well everyone uh again check out the many links in the show notes to the many projects we've talked about check out uh cass's portfolio of course check out the the Bruno Simon like uh amazing portfolio as well and uh I hope everybody walks away with a little bit more inspiration a little bit more knowledge about you know CSS HTML frontend development agency life all these things that we've talked about um thank you again for coming on Cass yeah thank you so much really and can I just say one thing like okay if y'all are like stuck on something or like anything CSS you want to talk your portfolio like please feel free to reach out I'm more than happy to like hang out talk things through that's all awesome you're such a chill person for like being so helpful and and like you know sending the elevator back down and as uh as Leon Noel from 100 devs likes to call it um yeah yeah it's so chill so everyone until next week happy coding bye
