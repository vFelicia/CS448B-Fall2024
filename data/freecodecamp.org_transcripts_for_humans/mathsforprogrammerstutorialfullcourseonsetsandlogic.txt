00:04 - hello world shawn grooms here with free
00:06 - codecamp and in this video i will be
00:08 - giving you three tips on how to learn
00:09 - discrete mathematics the first tip is to
00:12 - stay calm
00:13 - people often hear the word mathematics
00:16 - and panic and when you panic you stop
00:19 - listening and if you stop listening you
00:20 - can't learn the material so if you
00:22 - simply stay calm then you will be able
00:25 - to learn the material better you aren't
00:27 - being graded on the subject so there's
00:29 - no need to panic
00:31 - the second is to rewind
00:33 - you can rewind the videos at any time
00:36 - and when i learned discrete mathematics
00:38 - i didn't have this opportunity so in
00:40 - theory you should be able to learn the
00:42 - material much faster than i was ever
00:44 - able to so i strongly encourage
00:47 - rewinding videos
00:49 - finally explain
00:51 - once you think you understand the
00:52 - material of the videos
00:54 - you can try to explain the material out
00:57 - loud either to yourself or to a friend
01:00 - if no one's around or you feel weird
01:01 - talking to yourself then you can try to
01:04 - explain it to
01:05 - robert ducky there is a concept in
01:08 - programming called rubber duct debugging
01:11 - which is where programmers go through
01:13 - their code line by line trying to
01:15 - identify
01:16 - bugs in their code by explaining it to a
01:18 - rubber ducky so similarly if you go
01:21 - through the material of the videos
01:24 - subject by subject you will soon be able
01:26 - to identify
01:29 - any gaps in your understanding of the
01:30 - material
01:35 - in this video i'll be explaining what
01:37 - discrete mathematics is and why it's
01:39 - important for the field of computer
01:41 - science and programming
01:42 - discrete mathematics is a branch of
01:44 - mathematics that deals with discrete or
01:46 - finite sets of elements rather than
01:48 - continuous or infinite sets of elements
01:51 - imagine trying to run a program that
01:53 - requires an infinite number of
01:54 - executions to complete a task
01:56 - it's obvious to say that the program
01:58 - would run forever and the task would
01:59 - never be completed because there are an
02:01 - infinite number of executions
02:03 - in order to avoid this problem we
02:05 - approximate the continuous
02:07 - sets with discrete sets
02:10 - now you may be thinking i never use math
02:12 - that involves infinite sets but i
02:14 - promise that you do
02:16 - the simplest example is with a circle
02:18 - a circle by definition
02:20 - is an infinite number of points
02:22 - equidistant from a fixed point
02:25 - and
02:26 - the problem with this is that if we try
02:29 - to write a program that prints out all
02:31 - of these points it will run forever
02:33 - because they're an infinite number of
02:34 - points and therefore an infinite number
02:36 - of executions
02:38 - so
02:39 - this is physically impossible that's why
02:41 - if we zoom in here you can see that
02:44 - the when you come down to here there are
02:46 - all these points but in reality we
02:48 - should have even more points between
02:50 - these points and then if we zoom in on
02:52 - those we'll have more points between
02:53 - those points and we can never complete
02:55 - the task
02:56 - now we've all seen circles on computers
02:59 - so what's going on how is this possible
03:01 - we just established that it's impossible
03:04 - well the
03:05 - answer is that they're approximations
03:08 - for example consider
03:10 - regular polygons
03:12 - regular polygons
03:13 - like a triangle or a square or a
03:16 - pentagon those don't really look like
03:17 - circles but if you keep increasing the
03:20 - number of vertices
03:22 - eventually you'll start getting hexagons
03:24 - octagons dodecagons hexadecagons
03:28 - icosagons
03:29 - you can see that these regular polygons
03:31 - the more and more you keep increasing
03:33 - the number of vertices
03:34 - which the vertices are equidistant from
03:36 - a fixed point
03:38 - they will eventually approximate a
03:39 - circle eventually they will be
03:42 - indistinguishable to the naked eye and
03:44 - will look identical to a circle
03:50 - and in this video i'll be explaining
03:53 - what sets are
03:54 - a set is a collection of distinct
03:56 - objects called elements or members
03:59 - an element is essentially anything you
04:01 - want it to be
04:02 - and for example elements could be
04:04 - numbers letters variables more sets or
04:07 - nothing at all
04:09 - sets
04:10 - are usually denoted by capital letters
04:11 - such as capital a capital b
04:14 - c e or f
04:16 - and we say that the set contains
04:19 - elements for example
04:20 - we could say that the set a equals the
04:23 - set
04:24 - containing the element 5. or we can say
04:26 - that 5 is an element of a now
04:29 - i will be introducing a lot of symbols
04:31 - like this this just means is an element
04:33 - of and it'll save us a lot of time in
04:36 - future videos and i don't have to write
04:38 - out is an element of each time so
04:41 - that'll come in handy
04:43 - so what does the set actually look like
04:44 - well there are two common
04:46 - types of notation for sets and the one
04:49 - i'm introducing in this video is roster
04:50 - notation and it looks like this it's
04:52 - just curly braces with elements inside
04:55 - separated by commas which is very
04:57 - similar to javascript
04:59 - the only difference being that in
05:01 - math we use curly braces and in
05:03 - javascript we use a square
05:05 - bracket
05:07 - so
05:09 - now let's just walk through these so the
05:11 - uh the set a equals the set containing
05:14 - the element five that's how you would
05:16 - read this the set b equals the set
05:18 - containing elements two three and four
05:21 - the set c equals the set containing
05:24 - elements d f and g now d f and g
05:28 - they're not they don't have to be
05:30 - variables they're they're either
05:31 - variables or they could be characters it
05:33 - just depends on the context the set e it
05:36 - contains no elements in this case which
05:38 - has an impact
05:40 - that you'll see in future videos and
05:42 - finally the set f equals the set
05:45 - containing elements a b and c
05:47 - in this case our elements are sets so we
05:50 - would read this as f equals the set
05:53 - containing
05:55 - the set containing the element five the
05:58 - set containing elements two three and
06:00 - four and the set containing d f and g
06:03 - so in the next video i'll be going over
06:06 - a different form of set notation in
06:09 - addition to introducing you to some
06:11 - common sense and this will set us up
06:13 - eventually my goal is to bring us up to
06:17 - being able to define and understand
06:19 - algorithms and this is where we have to
06:21 - begin
06:26 - in this video i'll be introducing
06:27 - interval notation and talk about some
06:29 - common sets this will lay the foundation
06:32 - for the next video on set builder
06:33 - notation
06:35 - the beauty of interval notation is that
06:36 - it allows us to efficiently describe
06:39 - all numbers between two values
06:41 - suppose we wanted to say that the
06:43 - variable x is between
06:45 - 0 and 1
06:47 - well we could do just that we could say
06:49 - that x is an element of 0 the interval 0
06:52 - to 1
06:53 - or which is really saying x is greater
06:56 - than 0 and x is less than 1.
06:58 - likewise if we wanted to say that x is
07:00 - greater than or equal to zero
07:02 - and x is less than one then we have to
07:04 - switch this to a square bracket all
07:06 - we're doing is we're now including the
07:08 - number zero in the interval also we can
07:11 - include zero and we can also include one
07:14 - in the interval by using square brackets
07:16 - on both sides so it's greater than or
07:19 - equal to and less than or equal to
07:22 - and now i'll talk about some common sets
07:24 - the first one being the null set which
07:26 - is the same thing as the empty set
07:28 - which is
07:29 - just there are no elements contained
07:31 - within the set and this will come in
07:34 - handy uh in the future
07:36 - the funny end here is the natural
07:38 - numbers which is the set containing
07:40 - elements one two three
07:42 - and then these three dots here are
07:44 - called an ellipsis
07:45 - which tells us that the pattern
07:47 - continues so
07:48 - n is the set containing
07:51 - 1 2 3
07:53 - 4 5 6 7 all the way up to infinity
07:56 - this funny n with a zero is the natural
07:58 - numbers
08:00 - however it includes the value zero
08:03 - within the set so it's zero one two and
08:06 - then the ellipsis tells us all the way
08:07 - to infinity in an integer fashion zero
08:10 - one two three four 5 6
08:12 - and finally we have all of the integers
08:13 - positive and negative and non-negative
08:16 - which is 0 negative 1 negative 2 all the
08:19 - way down to negative infinity and 0 1 2
08:22 - 3 4 all the way up to infinity
08:28 - in this video i'll be introducing the
08:30 - rational numbers and set builder
08:32 - notation
08:33 - the rational numbers are defined as
08:35 - a ratio of two integers
08:38 - and examples include the integers
08:40 - themselves uh terminating decimals and
08:43 - repeating decimals so let's start with
08:45 - uh repeating decimals if we let 10x
08:48 - equal 9.999 repeating then if we divide
08:51 - by both sides by 10 then x equals 0.999
08:54 - repeating and if we subtract x from 10x
08:57 - we have 9x equals 9. and then divide
09:00 - both sides by 9 we have x equals 1.
09:03 - and then if we multiply by 10 both sides
09:06 - by 10 we have 10x equals 10. so now we
09:08 - have 10x
09:09 - equals 10 but 10x also equals 9.99 and
09:12 - repeating so we have now and these are
09:15 - in fact true 9.99 repeating equals 10.
09:18 - so we we can now express 10x as an
09:21 - integer which is a
09:23 - a
09:24 - rational number we can put 10 divided by
09:27 - 1 which is a ratio
09:30 - so
09:31 - another problem we have is terminating
09:33 - decimals if we have 2.78 equal to y then
09:37 - we can just
09:38 - easily say 278 divided by 100 equals y
09:41 - as well
09:42 - these are two integers
09:44 - and
09:45 - it's a it's another rational number so
09:47 - a convenient way to define these
09:50 - or is denoted with a q
09:53 - and this is called set builder notation
09:55 - we have the q equals the set containing
09:58 - elements
09:59 - a divided by b such that a
10:02 - and b are elements of the integers with
10:04 - the only condition that b cannot equal
10:07 - zero if you divide by zero uh it's it's
10:11 - undefined it doesn't mean anything so um
10:13 - if you're interested in that i recommend
10:15 - googling it i think it's interesting
10:21 - in this video i'll be giving an example
10:23 - of a non-rational number
10:25 - if the square root of 2 were a rational
10:27 - number
10:28 - then by definition it must be expressed
10:30 - as the ratio of two integers
10:32 - if we then square both sides we have two
10:35 - equals a squared divided by b squared
10:38 - if we multiply both sides by b squared
10:40 - we have 2b squared equals a squared and
10:43 - from this we know that a squared is even
10:45 - a squared is even because we have two
10:48 - times some integer which is b squared
10:51 - since a squared is even we know that a
10:53 - is even because a squared equals two
10:56 - times some integer the integer i chose
10:57 - was 2k squared
10:59 - that means that a times a can be
11:01 - expressed as 2k times 2k which is to say
11:03 - that a equals 2k
11:05 - i can now substitute 2 times 2k squared
11:09 - for a squared and that leaves us with b
11:12 - squared equals 2k squared once these
11:15 - twos cancel out now this also means that
11:18 - b squared is even because b squared
11:20 - equals 2 times some integer which is to
11:22 - say that b is also even following this
11:24 - same logic
11:26 - now if we go back to our original
11:28 - premise uh
11:30 - the square root of 2 equals
11:32 - a divided by b
11:34 - where a divided by b is an irreducible
11:37 - fraction
11:39 - but since a is an even number and b is
11:43 - also an even number we can express these
11:45 - numbers as 2k and 2l but these twos here
11:49 - will reduce meaning that we'll have
11:52 - the square root of 2 equals k divided by
11:54 - l
11:55 - but since this reduced since this is no
11:57 - longer explicitly represented as a
12:00 - divided by b and it reduced to k divided
12:02 - by l
12:03 - we know that we do not have a rational
12:05 - number
12:06 - now there's a more specific way to
12:10 - define these numbers or classify these
12:12 - numbers but we need set operators in the
12:15 - next video
12:20 - in this video i'll be defining four
12:22 - binary operators for sets
12:24 - i've defined
12:26 - two sets a and b to help give some
12:29 - examples
12:30 - so the first
12:32 - is a union b
12:34 - which equals a set containing elements p
12:36 - such that p is an element of a or p is
12:39 - an element of b
12:40 - the next is the intersection
12:43 - a intersection b
12:45 - equals the set containing elements
12:48 - p such that p is an element of a and p
12:51 - is an element of b
12:54 - the next is the set difference of a and
12:56 - b which equals the set containing p
12:59 - or elements p such that p is an element
13:02 - of a and p is not an element of b and
13:06 - finally we have the symmetric difference
13:08 - which is
13:10 - going to be very helpful when you
13:11 - actually complete the symmetric
13:14 - difference algorithm challenge
13:16 - so the symmetric difference of a and b
13:19 - equals
13:20 - the set difference of a and b union with
13:23 - the set difference of b and a
13:26 - and finally i will
13:29 - define the irrational numbers which i
13:30 - hinted to at the end of last video so
13:33 - the irrational numbers are simply the
13:36 - real number real numbers
13:39 - minus the rational numbers and that
13:42 - equals the irrational numbers
13:49 - in this video i will be using vent
13:51 - diagrams to give a graphical
13:52 - representation of the set operators we
13:54 - learned in the previous video
13:57 - so if you recall the definition of a
13:59 - union b you know that a union b equals
14:01 - the set containing elements x such that
14:04 - x is an element of a or x is an element
14:06 - of b
14:07 - so if we let this circle represent the
14:10 - set a and we let this circle represent
14:12 - the set b
14:13 - then
14:14 - that means that x can land anywhere
14:17 - in any of these circles which is why
14:19 - this right the entire region is shaded
14:21 - red we're saying that this red region
14:24 - represents all possible values of x
14:27 - and if we recall the definition of a of
14:29 - a intersection b that equals the set
14:32 - containing elements x such that x is an
14:34 - element of a
14:35 - and x is an element of b
14:37 - which is why the overlap
14:40 - where a and b overlap is is shaded red
14:42 - we're saying all possible values of x
14:45 - are this red region
14:46 - now the set difference of a and b equals
14:49 - the set containing elements x
14:51 - such that x is an element of a
14:54 - and x is also not an element of b which
14:57 - is why it's just this region here none
14:59 - of the
15:00 - elements are within
15:02 - b
15:03 - the set difference of b and a
15:06 - is
15:07 - the set containing elements x such that
15:10 - x is an element of b
15:12 - and x is not an element of a
15:15 - and finally the symmetric difference of
15:17 - a and b i defined as
15:19 - the union of a minus b and b minus a so
15:24 - we take uh
15:25 - this region in this region and we take
15:28 - the union of it which is why this is the
15:30 - resulting region there's no overlap
15:33 - between the two
15:34 - now this is a really good way to
15:36 - familiarize yourself with the concept of
15:39 - set operators however don't rely on it
15:42 - you should really focus on the
15:43 - definitions as it will help you out in
15:46 - the long term
15:52 - in this video i'll be introducing the
15:53 - concept of subsets and supersets
15:56 - the dots on the board here represent
15:58 - elements of a set
16:02 - the lines represent the sets themselves
16:05 - these lines have been labeled b a and u
16:09 - we can say that b is a subset of a
16:11 - because b contains because all elements
16:14 - of b
16:15 - are
16:16 - elements of a
16:18 - we can also say that b is a proper
16:20 - subset of a because all elements of b
16:24 - are elements of a
16:25 - and
16:26 - there are elements of a that are not
16:28 - within
16:29 - the set b
16:31 - we can also say that
16:33 - the set a is a
16:35 - superset of the set b because a contains
16:39 - all of the elements of b
16:41 - and being even more specific we can say
16:43 - that a is a proper superset of b
16:46 - because
16:48 - a contains all elements of b
16:51 - and there are elements of a that are not
16:52 - elements of b
16:55 - what we cannot say
16:56 - is that
16:57 - u is a proper subset of a
17:00 - although the circle here is bigger than
17:03 - a
17:05 - like it just takes up more space
17:07 - it doesn't contain any more elements so
17:09 - all the elements so u contains all
17:12 - elements of a however u does not contain
17:15 - any extra elements
17:17 - so
17:18 - u is a subset of a and a is actually a
17:20 - subset of u
17:23 - u is a superset of a and a is also a
17:25 - superset of u so the sets a and u in
17:27 - this case are actually equal
17:34 - in this video i'll be introducing the
17:36 - concept of the universal set and
17:38 - complements
17:39 - so i want to begin by talking about the
17:41 - universal set which is commonly referred
17:43 - to as the universe now the reason i use
17:47 - this fancy look in you here is that
17:50 - i was
17:51 - defining the universe which is to say
17:54 - the maximum boundaries of my set my
17:58 - biggest set
17:59 - everything outside of this
18:01 - blue circle here
18:03 - doesn't exist i mean
18:05 - it in terms of the sets nothing exists i
18:08 - don't even exist computer doesn't exist
18:11 - you don't exist
18:12 - but everything within it
18:14 - does
18:16 - so that's a very important key now if i
18:19 - don't define this if if i don't define
18:22 - my universal set then we just assume it
18:25 - to be the real numbers so if i just
18:27 - erase this
18:29 - then
18:32 - you know this will just be the real
18:34 - numbers which is we've talked about in
18:37 - previous videos
18:38 - so
18:39 - the other thing i want to talk about is
18:41 - complements so if i say
18:43 - if i'm looking for the complement of b
18:46 - and i'll i'll put a more formal
18:48 - definition of if i'm looking for the
18:49 - complement of b
18:51 - then
18:53 - it is everything that is not within b so
18:56 - all the elements not within b
18:58 - are going to be part of the c complement
19:00 - so in this case
19:02 - it would look
19:03 - like this if i just highlighted
19:05 - everything
19:06 - it would be
19:08 - everything within the universe still
19:12 - and then
19:16 - so that is the complement of b it's all
19:18 - the elements that are not in b
19:24 - so that's that's quite a bit of quite a
19:26 - bit i mean you've got one two three four
19:29 - five six seven so since this is the real
19:31 - numbers these little dots here would
19:33 - represent
19:34 - all the numbers all every single value
19:38 - rational irrational that are not within
19:41 - b
19:41 - so if this is
19:43 - one and two or better how about this
19:46 - this is the rational numbers and these
19:48 - are the integers
19:50 - so
19:51 - these would be everything outside of
19:53 - this would be the irrational numbers
19:56 - and
19:58 - the
19:59 - non-integer values
20:05 - in this video i'll be giving examples
20:07 - for subsets and supersets so if you look
20:10 - at this blue line here this represents
20:12 - our universal set uh
20:15 - we've defined it to be the integers from
20:17 - 1 to 11. that's 1 2 3 4 all the way up
20:19 - to 11. don't let it concern you that
20:21 - there are elements outside of our
20:23 - universe um
20:24 - that just means that they are i mean
20:26 - that just means they're not in the
20:27 - universe that we have in question right
20:29 - now so it's no different than having
20:31 - stars outside of your galaxy you're not
20:32 - concerned by that it's just a matter of
20:33 - fact
20:34 - so if you look at this green line
20:36 - uh what what set would that be well it
20:39 - can say it's elements three beta and
20:40 - gamma
20:41 - so does b b contains three beta and
20:44 - gamma so this would be the set b
20:47 - likewise this set here
20:49 - it contains elements three one and x
20:51 - well a contains three one and x so this
20:54 - is the set a and finally this set uh
20:57 - contains elements one and three this set
20:59 - contains elements one and three so this
21:01 - is the set
21:02 - c
21:03 - now what can be said about these sets
21:05 - well we have uh we can say that c is a
21:08 - subset of the universe because all
21:10 - elements of c are elements of the
21:12 - universe
21:14 - furthermore we can say that uh the set b
21:17 - is not a subset of the universe because
21:19 - there are elements of b that are not
21:20 - within the universe
21:22 - also we can say that the universe is not
21:25 - a subset a superset of a because there's
21:29 - elements of
21:31 - a that are not within
21:33 - or not contained by the universe
21:36 - and finally we can say that the universe
21:38 - is a proper superset of c because the
21:41 - universe contains all elements of c
21:44 - except
21:46 - and there are elements within the
21:47 - universe that are not within the set c
21:49 - so if we wanted to be more specific we
21:51 - could actually say that c
21:53 - is a proper subset of the universe
22:00 - in this video i'll be going over
22:01 - examples of complements so in this video
22:04 - i've defined the universe to be the
22:06 - integers one through five and it's
22:09 - denoted graphically by this blue line
22:11 - and if we recall the definition of uh
22:14 - the complements with or
22:16 - with regards to a
22:17 - we have a complement equals the set
22:19 - containing elements x such that x is an
22:22 - element of the universe
22:24 - and x is not an element of a
22:26 - so in that case
22:28 - we can look at uh all the integers one
22:31 - through five and if it contains any
22:34 - element from a we
22:35 - throw it out so
22:38 - in this case if we look at the integer 1
22:40 - we know that that's not going to be
22:41 - there because that's an a if we look at
22:43 - the integer 2 that'll be in our set if
22:46 - we look at the integer 3 that won't be
22:48 - in our set because that's also an a and
22:51 - then 4 and 5 are
22:53 - within the universe and they're not with
22:55 - an a
22:56 - next we have b complement well we know
22:58 - that one two four and five are within
23:01 - the universe and they're not within uh b
23:06 - and lastly we have c complement two four
23:10 - and five are within the universe and
23:12 - they're not within c because we had to
23:14 - exclude one and three
23:20 - i want to begin this video by reviewing
23:22 - our definitions of the union and
23:24 - intersection
23:25 - after that i'll be introducing two
23:27 - algebraic laws for sets
23:29 - so the definition of a union b
23:32 - equals set containing elements x such
23:35 - that x is an element of a or x is an
23:37 - element of b
23:38 - also a intersection b is defined as the
23:41 - set containing elements x such that x is
23:44 - an element of a
23:45 - and x is an element of b
23:47 - so when i
23:49 - introduce the importance law it should
23:51 - be clear that a union a equals a
23:54 - because a union a is defined as the set
23:57 - containing elements x such that x is an
23:59 - element of a
24:01 - or
24:01 - x is an element of a
24:04 - which should yield or you should see why
24:06 - that equals the set a
24:08 - also a intersection a equals the set
24:11 - containing elements x such that x is an
24:13 - element of a and
24:15 - x is an element of a which it should
24:18 - also be clear why that is the set a
24:22 - next we have our identity laws so
24:24 - identity laws are
24:28 - laws where we have a given set
24:30 - and we're performing an operation on
24:32 - that set with a given element uh these
24:34 - elements are the identity elements so
24:37 - for this case we have the null set and
24:39 - the universal center are identity
24:40 - elements so a union null set equals a
24:44 - and by definition that means that a
24:46 - union null set equals the set containing
24:48 - elements x such that x is an element of
24:51 - a
24:52 - or
24:53 - x is an element of the null set but
24:55 - since we know that the null set is empty
24:57 - we can't possibly have any elements in
24:59 - there
25:00 - so
25:01 - it's really saying that a union the null
25:04 - set is equal to the set containing
25:06 - elements x such that x is an element of
25:08 - a or
25:10 - more simply
25:12 - it equals a
25:18 - i want to begin this video by reviewing
25:20 - the definition of complements
25:23 - so the definition of a complement of a
25:25 - set for for instance the complement of a
25:28 - equals the set containing elements x
25:31 - such that x is not an element of a
25:35 - i will now be going over two new
25:37 - algebraic laws for sets
25:40 - the first are the law of complements
25:43 - the law of complements states that if we
25:45 - take the union of a set and its
25:47 - complement it equals the universe
25:49 - or if you take the complement of the
25:51 - null set it equals the universe
25:54 - furthermore uh the intersection of a set
25:57 - and its complement is the null set and
26:00 - that should be clear because if you have
26:02 - uh the set a
26:04 - and you are intersecting it with
26:07 - everything that is not inside a
26:09 - there's clearly not going to be any
26:11 - overlap so you're going to have an empty
26:14 - set
26:16 - the next one is the law of involution
26:19 - so involution
26:21 - states that
26:23 - if we have
26:24 - a
26:25 - uh state here let's call it state zero
26:29 - and we
26:30 - feed that state to a function in this
26:32 - case we're going to feed it to the
26:33 - complement function
26:35 - then when it gets to state one if we
26:37 - again feed it through the exact same
26:39 - function the complement function it will
26:41 - result in state 0 again in this case if
26:44 - we fed state
26:46 - if we fed set a through
26:49 - this
26:50 - cyclical function here then we would
26:52 - have a feed it through a complement we
26:54 - get a complement feed it back through
26:56 - the function we get a complement
26:57 - complement which equals a and then we
27:00 - can have a complement complement
27:01 - complement which would
27:03 - be a complement and then you get the
27:05 - idea it's cyclical
27:11 - in this video i'm introducing two more
27:13 - algebraic laws for sets
27:15 - associativity and commutativity
27:18 - associativity is uh essentially just
27:20 - saying that we can regroup
27:23 - uh the sets that we are talking about so
27:26 - um a intersection
27:28 - b intersection c that is a intersecting
27:31 - with the set b intersection c
27:33 - is equal to the set a intersection b
27:36 - intersection c
27:39 - and if you look at the definitions of uh
27:42 - intersection you can actually go through
27:44 - and figure out why this is and i'm
27:46 - pretty sure you'll be able to do that
27:47 - based on the videos that uh you've
27:50 - already watched
27:51 - and the same is true for the union
27:54 - uh commutativity is essentially just
27:55 - saying that we can um switch which side
27:59 - our sets are
28:00 - relative to the the operation so a
28:03 - intersection b is the same thing as b
28:04 - intersection a and the same thing is a
28:07 - union b is equal to b union a
28:09 - so if we look at the actual definition
28:11 - we have
28:12 - a intersection b
28:14 - is defined as the set containing
28:16 - elements x such that x is an element of
28:18 - a and x is an element of b and that's
28:21 - going to equal the set containing
28:22 - elements x such that x is an element of
28:24 - b and x is an element of a so if you
28:27 - just look at these uh the conditions for
28:29 - these for the set builder notation here
28:31 - it's essentially just a uh argument of
28:33 - grammar at this point so uh basic
28:36 - english will tell you that you can
28:38 - just switch which side that you have
28:40 - these on
28:46 - in this video i'll be introducing
28:47 - another algebraic law of sets the
28:49 - distributive law
28:51 - the distributive law is simply saying
28:53 - that
28:54 - the set and operation will be
28:56 - distributed over another set in
28:58 - operation
29:00 - for instance a intersection b union c
29:03 - equals a intersection b union a
29:06 - intersection c
29:07 - so i thought it might be helpful to use
29:09 - uh venn diagrams for the
29:12 - conceptual idea of this and then i'll do
29:14 - a separate video on the actual
29:16 - definition
29:17 - so if we look at a here and we separate
29:21 - a
29:23 - and then we decide to
29:25 - separate b union c
29:30 - then when we actually go to find the
29:33 - union or the intersection of these two
29:35 - regions it's easy to see that it is this
29:38 - region
29:41 - so hopefully for the purposes of
29:43 - equality this region here will match
29:45 - this region here
29:47 - so let's get right to it we have a
29:49 - intersection b so we have the set a and
29:51 - the set b so that means that a
29:53 - intersection b is going to be this
29:55 - region here
29:57 - and we have to also find a intersection
29:59 - c
30:01 - so that's this region
30:03 - and if we take the union of those two
30:05 - regions then we're left with all this
30:08 - jazz
30:11 - so
30:11 - it looks like they are in fact equal but
30:15 - to be more rigorous we'll
30:16 - revisit the actual definition of the
30:19 - intersection in the unions in the next
30:21 - video
30:26 - in my previous video on subsets and
30:27 - supersets i stated that to show equality
30:30 - you have to prove that each side of an
30:32 - equation
30:33 - are are subsets of each other so to
30:36 - prove the distributive law we're going
30:38 - to have this video we're going to have
30:39 - the next video in this video i'm going
30:40 - to be showing that a is a
30:43 - a intersection b union c is a subset of
30:47 - a intersection b union a intersection c
30:50 - so let's start the proof
30:53 - suppose that x is an element of a
30:56 - intersection b union c
30:58 - then x is an element of a and x is an
31:01 - element of b union c by definition of
31:05 - the intersection
31:07 - so we still know that x is an element of
31:09 - a and by definition we know that x is an
31:12 - element of b or x is an element of c
31:15 - from this we can deduce that x is x is
31:17 - an element of a and x is an element of b
31:20 - or x is an element of a and x is an
31:23 - element of c
31:25 - now by definition we can
31:27 - put this or rewrite this as x as an
31:30 - element of a intersection b
31:32 - or x is an element of a intersection c
31:36 - and finally we can deduce that x is an
31:39 - element of a intersection b
31:41 - union a intersection c so there you have
31:44 - it we've shown that since x is an
31:47 - element of a intersection b union c
31:50 - and x is an element of a intersection b
31:52 - union a intersection c
31:55 - x is in
31:56 - both of these and therefore a
31:59 - intersection b union c is in fact a
32:01 - subset of a intersection b
32:04 - union a intersection c
32:11 - in this video i have the proof of the
32:12 - second case for the distributive law
32:16 - in this case we're showing that a
32:17 - intersection b
32:19 - union a intersection c is a subset of a
32:22 - intersection b union c
32:24 - so let's start by saying that
32:27 - suppose that x is an element of a
32:30 - intersection b union a intersection c
32:33 - then we know that x is an element of a
32:36 - intersection b or x is an element of a
32:39 - intersection c and we know this because
32:42 - of the definition of the union
32:44 - from here we can
32:47 - then state that x is an element of a and
32:50 - x is an element of b
32:52 - or x is an element of a
32:54 - and x is an element of c
32:57 - from that we can deduce that x is an
32:59 - element of a and x is an element of b or
33:02 - x is an element of c and here we um
33:05 - we sort of
33:06 - factored out the x as an element of a
33:09 - and
33:10 - and then regrouped x is element of b or
33:13 - x is an element of c
33:15 - and from here we can
33:16 - by definition right x is element of a
33:19 - and x is an element of b union c
33:22 - which finally we can state x's and
33:24 - elements of a intersection b union c
33:27 - which is what we wanted to show so there
33:29 - you have it we've proved that uh
33:32 - x is an element of both of these and
33:34 - therefore this is a subset of this and
33:37 - we've shown that
33:39 - both sides of the equation are subsets
33:42 - of each other and therefore the
33:44 - distributive law is in fact
33:46 - true it's
33:50 - proven this video i'll be going over an
33:53 - example of the distributive law
33:56 - so if you look at a intersection b unc
34:00 - that is supposed to equal a intersection
34:02 - b union a intersection c
34:04 - so if we can if we decompose this
34:06 - equation and look at uh let's start with
34:08 - a intersection b then that equals
34:11 - singleton 3 based off from these
34:14 - predetermined sets
34:16 - and then if we look at a intersection c
34:18 - that equals the set 1 3. so the union of
34:21 - these two is going to be the set
34:24 - containing elements 1 and 3.
34:27 - now if we look at b union c that equals
34:29 - the set containing elements 1 3 beta and
34:31 - gamma
34:32 - and if we take the intersection of that
34:34 - set with a we're left with a set
34:36 - containing elements one and three which
34:38 - is good because now we've shown that
34:39 - this is equal to that
34:42 - now if we look at a union b intersection
34:44 - c
34:45 - that's supposed to equal a union b
34:47 - intersection a union c
34:49 - so if we analyze b intersection c that
34:52 - equals singleton 3
34:54 - and then a union b
34:56 - right here equals 1 3 x beta gamma
35:00 - and a union c equals the set containing
35:02 - elements 1 3 and x
35:04 - so when we take the intersection of
35:06 - these two sets we're left with the set
35:08 - containing elements 1 3 and x
35:10 - and when we take the union of b
35:12 - intersection c
35:13 - with a
35:15 - we're left with the second containing
35:16 - elements 1 3 and x which
35:18 - is exactly what we wanted so yeah we've
35:20 - shown that
35:21 - these are in fact true
35:27 - in this video i'll be introducing the
35:29 - very last algebraic law of sets known as
35:32 - de morgan's law de morgan's law was
35:34 - founded by augustus de morgan and it
35:36 - states that the complement of a union
35:40 - is the intersection of the complements
35:44 - or it says that the complement of the
35:46 - intersection is the union of the
35:48 - complements so we're going to prove that
35:50 - the uh complement of the union of a and
35:53 - b
35:54 - is
35:56 - is in fact equal to the
35:59 - uh complement of a intersected with the
36:02 - complement of b so to do this we have to
36:04 - show that
36:05 - the complement of a union b is a subset
36:07 - of a complement intersection b
36:09 - complement and vice versa
36:11 - so let's get started
36:13 - suppose that x is an element of a union
36:16 - b complement
36:17 - if that's the case then by definition x
36:20 - is not an element of a union b
36:22 - and if x is not an element of a union b
36:25 - that is if x is not an element of the
36:27 - region a union b which is the red here
36:30 - then surely x is not an element of a
36:33 - and x is not an element of b and if
36:35 - that's the case then by definition x is
36:38 - not an element of a complement and x is
36:40 - not an element of b complement
36:43 - therefore x is not
36:45 - an element of a complement intersection
36:47 - b complement
36:48 - so if we go to the other side here
36:51 - we start by saying let's let's suppose
36:53 - that x is an element of a complement
36:56 - intersection b complement
36:58 - then by definition x is an element of a
37:00 - complement and x is element of b
37:02 - complement by definition of the
37:04 - complements x is not an element of a and
37:07 - x is not an element of b
37:10 - and
37:11 - with the same logic x is not an element
37:13 - of a union b
37:15 - because x is not an element of this
37:18 - region and x is not an element of this
37:19 - region so surely it's not an element of
37:22 - the two regions combined
37:24 - and by definition of complements x is an
37:27 - element of a union b complement
37:36 - in this video
37:38 - in this video i'll be giving examples of
37:40 - de morgan's law de morgan's law states
37:43 - that the complement of the intersection
37:45 - equals the union of the complements and
37:47 - that the complement of the union equals
37:49 - the intersection of the complements so
37:52 - if we check out these new uh this new
37:54 - universal set here it is equal to the
37:56 - set containing integers such that
37:59 - x is greater than or equal to zero and x
38:01 - is less than or equal to five or more
38:04 - simply the universe equals the set
38:06 - containing
38:07 - integers from 0 to 5.
38:09 - so if we decompose our first equation
38:12 - a intersection b
38:13 - equals singleton 3
38:16 - the complement of a intersection b is
38:18 - going to be integers from 0 to 5
38:20 - excluding a intersection b so 0 1 2 4
38:24 - and 5.
38:26 - now the
38:27 - complement of a is equal to 2
38:31 - four and five because a contains the
38:34 - integers one and three so those are
38:36 - excluded and b complement is going to be
38:38 - equal to zero one two four five because
38:41 - b
38:42 - contains three so it's excluded
38:45 - so the intersection or the union rather
38:48 - of a complement in b complement equals 0
38:52 - 1 2 4 and 5 which is in fact equal to
38:56 - the complement of a intersection b which
38:58 - is what we wanted so the next equation
39:01 - we have a union b
39:02 - and that's equal to
39:04 - 1 3 x beta gamma
39:07 - now the complement of that is equal to 0
39:09 - 2 4 5 because we've excluded everything
39:13 - from uh a union b
39:16 - and now if we look at a complement
39:19 - intersection b complement we also have
39:21 - the set containing elements zero two
39:23 - four and five so which is exactly what
39:25 - we wanted so now we know that these two
39:27 - are equal so there you have it both of
39:28 - our equations worked out and we can
39:31 - happily use de morgan's law
39:40 - in this video i'll be explaining what
39:41 - logic is and why we need it
39:43 - i want to begin with an excerpt from the
39:46 - book of proof by richard hammack this is
39:49 - a free textbook and it's excellent you
39:52 - can find it online and it covers all
39:55 - foundational mathematics to include uh
39:58 - discrete mathematics and i i cannot
40:00 - recommend it enough
40:02 - so the excerpt is logic is a systematic
40:04 - way of thinking that allows us to deduce
40:07 - new information from old information and
40:09 - to parse the meaning of sentences so
40:12 - what this is saying is that essentially
40:14 - with without logic we wouldn't be able
40:16 - to deduce or
40:18 - move from point a to point b
40:21 - and or make claims from point a to point
40:24 - b in
40:25 - a hundred percent affirmative uh no
40:29 - questions asked
40:30 - way
40:31 - and uh so that so that's very important
40:34 - for mathematics if you couldn't do that
40:36 - in mathematics then um
40:39 - it would all fall apart you there there
40:41 - would be no certainty there would be no
40:43 - foundation no argument for us to stand
40:46 - on and we would just be a bunch of
40:47 - people
40:49 - throwing numbers about and making
40:51 - guesses essentially so it's very very
40:53 - important
40:54 - uh the parsing
40:56 - the other part of the quote to parse the
40:58 - meaning of sentences won't make sense
41:00 - until later videos when we actually um
41:03 - do that so just bear with me on that one
41:06 - so
41:07 - why should you care about programmers so
41:10 - well programmers use
41:13 - algorithms or well programmers write
41:15 - code first of all code uses algorithms
41:17 - algorithms is
41:19 - essentially just math and mathematics
41:21 - requires logic so it's that simple
41:28 - in this video i'll be introducing the
41:30 - notion of a proposition a proposition is
41:32 - simply a
41:34 - declarative statement with a verifiable
41:36 - truth value
41:37 - they are usually denoted by lowercase
41:39 - letters so if we have this lowercase p
41:42 - equals rain falls from the sky
41:44 - now that's a true statement rain does
41:47 - fall from this guy but it could have
41:48 - been a false statement like q q equals
41:52 - ghana is a country in asia ghana is not
41:55 - a country in asia ghana is a country in
41:57 - africa so this is a false proposition
42:01 - or a false statement
42:02 - are
42:04 - what are you doing
42:06 - there's no truth value that can be
42:08 - assigned to that it's just it's just a
42:09 - question it's considered an open
42:11 - statement
42:12 - s equals wash the laundry again this is
42:15 - an open statement it has no truth value
42:17 - to it it's a command
42:20 - five equals four plus eighty nine
42:22 - uh that again that that that does
42:25 - actually have a uh truth value to it uh
42:28 - but it's again it's a false state
42:29 - because 5 does not equal 4 plus 89.
42:33 - 7 equals alpha
42:35 - i i don't know if it does
42:37 - i mean i've no i don't know what alpha
42:39 - is so this is an open statement um
42:41 - we can't verify the truth of this
42:44 - 3 equals 5 divided by 0. this is a
42:48 - proposition this is how this has a truth
42:50 - value because
42:51 - 3 does not equal 5 divided by 0. that's
42:54 - 5 divided by 0 is undefined
42:56 - and then 99 times one-third equals 33.
42:59 - so this does have a verify verifiable
43:02 - truth value and it's true
43:08 - in this video i'll be introducing the
43:10 - concept of composite propositions
43:12 - just like regular propositions composite
43:14 - propositions
43:16 - are declarative statements with a
43:18 - verifiable truth value
43:20 - composite propositions are made up of
43:23 - subpropositions
43:24 - and in this video we're going to talk
43:26 - about the conjunction and the
43:29 - disjunction
43:30 - so the first one i want to introduce is
43:32 - the conjunction that is p
43:35 - and q that's how you would read this p
43:37 - and q
43:38 - and
43:39 - so this composite proposition here is
43:42 - rain falls from the sky
43:44 - and ghana is a country in asia
43:48 - so the two subpropositions in this would
43:50 - be p
43:52 - p and q um and this has a verifiable
43:56 - truth value because
43:58 - rain falls from the sky because that is
44:00 - a true statement
44:01 - but the
44:02 - statement q ghana is a country in asia
44:05 - is false
44:07 - we have p and q we have true and false
44:10 - which means that it's false one of them
44:12 - is false
44:13 - and we'll talk about this more when we
44:15 - get into truth tables
44:17 - the next is the disjunction p or q
44:20 - that's read as or
44:23 - rain falls from the sky or ghana is a
44:26 - country in asia
44:28 - so again we have true or false this time
44:31 - so only one of these need to be true in
44:33 - order for everything to be true and
44:35 - therefore p or q is a true statement
44:43 - in this video i'll be introducing truth
44:45 - tables truth tables are the easiest way
44:47 - to visualize
44:48 - why something is true or false
44:51 - and they're really convenient when we
44:53 - start getting up into uh
44:55 - conjunctions and disjunctions
44:57 - so if you remember p and q p is defined
45:01 - as rain falls from the sky and q is
45:03 - ghana is a country in asia
45:05 - then p or q or both p and q have two
45:09 - possible values true or false they're
45:11 - primitive propositions so we just put
45:13 - them in a table true and false and then
45:15 - true or false but i i circled these
45:18 - because i know that p is true and i know
45:20 - that q is false
45:22 - but when i analyze a conjunction or
45:24 - disjunction i have to add two more rows
45:28 - to the truth table and that's because if
45:30 - you like if you imagine this as starting
45:32 - on a path here you can choose to go
45:35 - either true or false
45:37 - when it say i took true when i get to
45:39 - the end of that path i can then choose
45:41 - true or false again so i'm stuck with
45:44 - four different possibilities here the
45:46 - first one being true true true false and
45:49 - then false true and then false false
45:52 - so when i actually go to my table here i
45:53 - have true true true false and yada yada
45:56 - and then
45:57 - uh when i
45:59 - stick in my conjunction i have true and
46:02 - true equals true
46:03 - uh true and false equals false true
46:06 - false and true equals false and then
46:07 - false and false equals false
46:10 - p or q
46:11 - true or true equals true true or false
46:13 - equals
46:14 - true false or true equals true and false
46:17 - or false equals false and these are by
46:19 - the definitions of the conjunction and
46:22 - the disjunction that's why that's why
46:25 - these values take on true or false
46:32 - in this video i'll introduce our first
46:34 - two algebraic laws of logic in
46:36 - importance and identities these are the
46:38 - same laws we saw in set theory
46:41 - if you recall it impotence is
46:44 - when you can take a proposition and
46:46 - apply a binary operator to that
46:49 - proposition over and over and will never
46:50 - change the value of the original
46:52 - proposition
46:53 - for instance p
46:55 - is the logical equivalent that's what
46:56 - these mean the logical equivalent of p
46:59 - or p which is the logical equivalent of
47:02 - p and p
47:03 - and if you recall the definition of uh
47:06 - the disjunction
47:07 - and the conjunction you should be able
47:09 - to figure out why this occurs
47:13 - now the i
47:14 - identity law states that if we take
47:17 - a proposition
47:19 - and we
47:20 - have a conjunction with true a truth
47:24 - value
47:25 - a true value then it will always yield
47:28 - that original proposition
47:30 - likewise if we have a disjunction
47:34 - with a proposition and false it will
47:37 - always yield the original proposition
47:40 - that's why we have p is the logical
47:41 - equivalent of p or false which is the
47:44 - logical equivalent of p and true
47:48 - and uh finally
47:50 - we have uh true and false the identities
47:52 - of true and false so if you have the
47:56 - disjunction of true with any proposition
48:00 - then you will always yield a true value
48:04 - and if you have a conjunction with any
48:07 - proposition in false it will always
48:09 - yield the false value
48:15 - in this video i'll be introducing two
48:17 - more algebraic laws of logic the law of
48:19 - complements in the law of involution
48:22 - we start by examining our primitive
48:24 - proposition p
48:26 - we know that p either is true or false
48:29 - if we look at the negation of p which is
48:32 - read as not p then we know that
48:35 - p is false and true because not p is
48:38 - defined as
48:39 - when p is true
48:41 - not p is false and when p is false not p
48:44 - is true
48:45 - so the law of involution tells us that
48:49 - if we have a proposition
48:50 - and we feed it through a function twice
48:53 - we'll end up in the same spot so if we
48:55 - have
48:56 - proposition p starting at state zero
48:58 - feed it through a function the negation
49:00 - function it'll bring us to state one as
49:03 - not p if we feed not p through the
49:05 - function it'll bring us back to state
49:06 - zero which is p or known as not not p so
49:10 - uh p is logically equivalent to not not
49:13 - p that's what involution tells us
49:17 - we then analyze the law of complements
49:19 - which tells us that the uh
49:22 - disjunction of p and its negation not p
49:26 - will be the logical equivalent of the
49:28 - true value so it is a it is known as a
49:31 - tautology it is always true
49:34 - uh and that's the corresponding truth
49:36 - table here
49:38 - it also tells us that
49:40 - uh a proposition and the conjunction of
49:43 - its negation is always false which is
49:45 - known as a fallacy
49:47 - so you can go through this truth table
49:50 - and you'll see that we have a tautology
49:52 - fallacy tautology tautology fallacy and
49:56 - fallacy
50:00 - in this video i'll be introducing
50:02 - another algebraic law of logic
50:04 - commutative law
50:06 - so we start by looking at all possible
50:09 - cases of p and q
50:11 - we know that based on the
50:13 - path problem that we did when i first
50:15 - introduced truth tables we know that
50:17 - there's four possible cases for both the
50:20 - disjunction and the conjunction of p and
50:23 - q
50:24 - so if we analyze this we know that true
50:27 - and true for the disjunction of p and q
50:30 - is going to yield true and also this is
50:33 - going to be true and false yields true
50:35 - false and true yields true and false and
50:37 - falsies it's true
50:38 - so all we're doing for the commutative
50:40 - law is switching
50:42 - the order of q and p on the
50:46 - operation
50:47 - so instead of having p or q we have q or
50:50 - p
50:51 - so
50:52 - in fact we do have true true true faults
50:54 - so we've shown that both p or q
50:57 - and q or p are
50:59 - logically equivalent
51:02 - for the conjunction of p and q
51:05 - by definition we know that true and true
51:09 - is going to yield true true and false
51:11 - yields false
51:13 - false and true yields false and false
51:15 - and false
51:16 - yields false
51:18 - so when we commute p and q and we have q
51:21 - and p
51:22 - it's not surprising that we get the
51:25 - exact same answer which is good because
51:27 - now we've shown that p and q
51:29 - is logically equivalent to q and p
51:37 - in this video i'll be introducing the
51:39 - associative law and the distributive law
51:41 - for logic
51:42 - now previously we've only dealt with two
51:45 - primitive propositions so
51:48 - that's why we've only ever had
51:50 - four possible outcomes in our true or
51:53 - false path
51:54 - now we're going to take this a step
51:56 - further and we're going to have eight
51:59 - propositions or eight possible outcomes
52:01 - for our
52:02 - true or false path because we're dealing
52:04 - with three propositions p q and r
52:08 - so there's not much to be said about the
52:11 - uh associative law or the distributive
52:13 - law
52:14 - and unfortunately i can't
52:16 - fit the truth table to prove these on my
52:19 - white board it's it and it gets really
52:22 - messy so i'm gonna have them at the end
52:25 - of the video and go through them make
52:27 - sure you understand them and if you
52:28 - don't go back and review the concepts of
52:31 - truth tables
53:11 - in this video i'll be introducing our
53:13 - last algebraic law of logic
53:16 - de morgan's law
53:17 - de morgan's law states that the negation
53:20 - of the conjunction is the logical
53:21 - equivalent of the disjunction of the
53:24 - negations and also that the negation of
53:27 - the disjunction is the logical
53:29 - equivalent of the conjunction of the
53:31 - negations
53:33 - so if we look at our truth table i've
53:35 - decomposed our
53:38 - propositions here so that we have p not
53:42 - p q not q and i have it all out on the
53:44 - board so that i can just simply look at
53:47 - uh not p and q which is our first law
53:51 - and see that it is in fact equivalent to
53:54 - not p or not q
53:56 - so these two columns are equal so we can
53:59 - uh definitively say that these are
54:01 - logical equivalents
54:04 - also
54:05 - not p or q
54:07 - is the
54:09 - is in fact not p
54:12 - and not q
54:13 - based on our truth table it's 100
54:16 - certain it's this is logic and there's
54:18 - uh
54:19 - no argument against it
54:25 - in this video i'll be introducing the
54:27 - notion of conditional statements a
54:29 - conditional statement contains a
54:30 - hypothesis and a conclusion these are
54:32 - more formally known as an antecedent and
54:35 - a consequent
54:36 - so
54:37 - all this is saying is that
54:40 - when we look at these the actual
54:41 - conditional this is the hypothesis and
54:44 - this is a conclusion so p implies this
54:47 - is read as p implies q and also as if p
54:50 - then q
54:51 - so p implies q is only false when a
54:55 - hypothesis leads to a a false conclusion
54:58 - or a uh antecedent leads to leads to a
55:02 - false consequence
55:04 - so that's why we have uh if we have true
55:07 - implies true that leads to a true
55:09 - statement and if we have true
55:12 - uh implies false that leads to a false
55:14 - statement
55:15 - these other three the converse inverse
55:17 - and contra contrapositive
55:19 - are
55:20 - uh
55:21 - essentially they're just common
55:23 - implications that we run into or common
55:25 - uh conditional statements that we run
55:27 - into
55:28 - and the converse is simply q implies p
55:32 - uh inverse is not p implies not q
55:35 - and not q implies not p
55:38 - is log which is contrapositive is
55:40 - logically equivalent to the original
55:42 - conditional statement
55:48 - in this video i'll be introducing the
55:49 - universal and existential quantifiers
55:51 - but first i have to introduce the
55:53 - propositional function
55:54 - the propositional function denoted p of
55:57 - x takes on a value of true or false
56:00 - but it takes on a value of true or false
56:02 - for everything that you feed to it
56:06 - so in this case with the universal
56:08 - quantifier this is read as for every
56:11 - you would say for every x that is an
56:13 - element of the universe p of x is either
56:16 - true or false
56:17 - for every x
56:19 - uh the shorthand for this is for every x
56:22 - p of x
56:23 - you could also say uh there exists
56:26 - that's the existential quantifier
56:28 - there exists is just stating that there
56:30 - is at least one
56:32 - so if we say there exists an uh there
56:35 - exists an x that is an element of the
56:37 - universe we're saying there is at least
56:40 - one x at least one x that is an element
56:42 - of the universe
56:43 - such that p of x is true or false
56:46 - and you can again use the shorthand uh
56:48 - there exists an x p of x so we look at
56:50 - these examples
56:52 - for every x that is an element of the
56:54 - naturals
56:55 - x plus 3 is greater than 4. so that is a
56:59 - that is a
57:00 - false statement because
57:02 - the first value of the natural numbers
57:05 - is 1 so x plus 3 is 4 which is not
57:09 - greater than 4.
57:10 - also for every x is an element of the
57:13 - real numbers
57:14 - x plus 3 is greater than 4. that is also
57:16 - false i can think of
57:18 - well there are infinitely many numbers
57:20 - that are
57:22 - not true for this
57:25 - and then in this case i said there does
57:26 - not exist
57:28 - an x that is now under the naturals such
57:30 - that x plus 3 is greater than 4. and
57:32 - that is also a false statement because
57:35 - if i let x equal 2
57:37 - that 2 is a natural number
57:39 - and 2 plus 3 is greater than 4 so this
57:42 - is a false statement
57:44 - there exists an element of the real
57:45 - numbers such that x plus 3 is greater
57:48 - than 4. that is a true statement because
57:51 - any number greater than
57:53 - one is going to yield
57:55 - a true statement in this case
58:01 - in this video i'm going to be going over
58:02 - some examples of tautologies tautologies
58:05 - are simply propositions that are always
58:06 - true this first one is the law of
58:08 - excluded middle which is p or not p
58:12 - so for here we have p or not p so true
58:15 - or false true or false false or true or
58:17 - false are true which yields nothing but
58:19 - a true column
58:21 - next we have the
58:23 - law of contradiction so if you ignore
58:25 - this negation here in this column of
58:28 - trues here
58:29 - we have p and not p
58:32 - so true and false sealed false true and
58:34 - false yields false false and true false
58:36 - and true all yield false now when we
58:38 - actually apply this negation to the uh
58:41 - false column here that yields a column
58:44 - of truths so the law of contradiction is
58:46 - a tautology
58:47 - finally we have modus tollens modus
58:49 - tollens is p implies q and not q implies
58:53 - not p
58:54 - so let's break this down p implies q
58:57 - p implies q is only ever negative when
59:00 - the hypothesis predicts true and the
59:02 - conclusion is false so if we have uh
59:05 - true implies true here is going to be
59:08 - true true implies false that's false
59:11 - false implies true is going to be true
59:12 - false implies false that's also false
59:15 - i mean that's also true we then take
59:18 - this column and uh take a conjunction
59:21 - with not q so true and not false is
59:24 - going to yield false
59:26 - false and true is going to yield false
59:28 - again false and true is going to yield
59:30 - false and true and true is going to
59:32 - yield true so finally we take this
59:35 - column here
59:36 - and that is our we imply not p so this
59:40 - column implies not p
59:42 - so false implying not p is going to be
59:45 - true
59:47 - false implying false is going to be true
59:49 - false implying true is also true and
59:52 - true implying true is also true so there
59:54 - you have it we have this whole column
59:56 - here for modus tollens and that is
60:01 - therefore a tautology
60:03 - there's nothing special about these
60:04 - tautologies these are just examples of
60:06 - tautologies

hello world shawn grooms here with free codecamp and in this video i will be giving you three tips on how to learn discrete mathematics the first tip is to stay calm people often hear the word mathematics and panic and when you panic you stop listening and if you stop listening you can't learn the material so if you simply stay calm then you will be able to learn the material better you aren't being graded on the subject so there's no need to panic the second is to rewind you can rewind the videos at any time and when i learned discrete mathematics i didn't have this opportunity so in theory you should be able to learn the material much faster than i was ever able to so i strongly encourage rewinding videos finally explain once you think you understand the material of the videos you can try to explain the material out loud either to yourself or to a friend if no one's around or you feel weird talking to yourself then you can try to explain it to robert ducky there is a concept in programming called rubber duct debugging which is where programmers go through their code line by line trying to identify bugs in their code by explaining it to a rubber ducky so similarly if you go through the material of the videos subject by subject you will soon be able to identify any gaps in your understanding of the material in this video i'll be explaining what discrete mathematics is and why it's important for the field of computer science and programming discrete mathematics is a branch of mathematics that deals with discrete or finite sets of elements rather than continuous or infinite sets of elements imagine trying to run a program that requires an infinite number of executions to complete a task it's obvious to say that the program would run forever and the task would never be completed because there are an infinite number of executions in order to avoid this problem we approximate the continuous sets with discrete sets now you may be thinking i never use math that involves infinite sets but i promise that you do the simplest example is with a circle a circle by definition is an infinite number of points equidistant from a fixed point and the problem with this is that if we try to write a program that prints out all of these points it will run forever because they're an infinite number of points and therefore an infinite number of executions so this is physically impossible that's why if we zoom in here you can see that the when you come down to here there are all these points but in reality we should have even more points between these points and then if we zoom in on those we'll have more points between those points and we can never complete the task now we've all seen circles on computers so what's going on how is this possible we just established that it's impossible well the answer is that they're approximations for example consider regular polygons regular polygons like a triangle or a square or a pentagon those don't really look like circles but if you keep increasing the number of vertices eventually you'll start getting hexagons octagons dodecagons hexadecagons icosagons you can see that these regular polygons the more and more you keep increasing the number of vertices which the vertices are equidistant from a fixed point they will eventually approximate a circle eventually they will be indistinguishable to the naked eye and will look identical to a circle and in this video i'll be explaining what sets are a set is a collection of distinct objects called elements or members an element is essentially anything you want it to be and for example elements could be numbers letters variables more sets or nothing at all sets are usually denoted by capital letters such as capital a capital b c e or f and we say that the set contains elements for example we could say that the set a equals the set containing the element 5. or we can say that 5 is an element of a now i will be introducing a lot of symbols like this this just means is an element of and it'll save us a lot of time in future videos and i don't have to write out is an element of each time so that'll come in handy so what does the set actually look like well there are two common types of notation for sets and the one i'm introducing in this video is roster notation and it looks like this it's just curly braces with elements inside separated by commas which is very similar to javascript the only difference being that in math we use curly braces and in javascript we use a square bracket so now let's just walk through these so the uh the set a equals the set containing the element five that's how you would read this the set b equals the set containing elements two three and four the set c equals the set containing elements d f and g now d f and g they're not they don't have to be variables they're they're either variables or they could be characters it just depends on the context the set e it contains no elements in this case which has an impact that you'll see in future videos and finally the set f equals the set containing elements a b and c in this case our elements are sets so we would read this as f equals the set containing the set containing the element five the set containing elements two three and four and the set containing d f and g so in the next video i'll be going over a different form of set notation in addition to introducing you to some common sense and this will set us up eventually my goal is to bring us up to being able to define and understand algorithms and this is where we have to begin in this video i'll be introducing interval notation and talk about some common sets this will lay the foundation for the next video on set builder notation the beauty of interval notation is that it allows us to efficiently describe all numbers between two values suppose we wanted to say that the variable x is between 0 and 1 well we could do just that we could say that x is an element of 0 the interval 0 to 1 or which is really saying x is greater than 0 and x is less than 1. likewise if we wanted to say that x is greater than or equal to zero and x is less than one then we have to switch this to a square bracket all we're doing is we're now including the number zero in the interval also we can include zero and we can also include one in the interval by using square brackets on both sides so it's greater than or equal to and less than or equal to and now i'll talk about some common sets the first one being the null set which is the same thing as the empty set which is just there are no elements contained within the set and this will come in handy uh in the future the funny end here is the natural numbers which is the set containing elements one two three and then these three dots here are called an ellipsis which tells us that the pattern continues so n is the set containing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 all the way up to infinity this funny n with a zero is the natural numbers however it includes the value zero within the set so it's zero one two and then the ellipsis tells us all the way to infinity in an integer fashion zero one two three four 5 6 and finally we have all of the integers positive and negative and nonnegative which is 0 negative 1 negative 2 all the way down to negative infinity and 0 1 2 3 4 all the way up to infinity in this video i'll be introducing the rational numbers and set builder notation the rational numbers are defined as a ratio of two integers and examples include the integers themselves uh terminating decimals and repeating decimals so let's start with uh repeating decimals if we let 10x equal 9.999 repeating then if we divide by both sides by 10 then x equals 0.999 repeating and if we subtract x from 10x we have 9x equals 9. and then divide both sides by 9 we have x equals 1. and then if we multiply by 10 both sides by 10 we have 10x equals 10. so now we have 10x equals 10 but 10x also equals 9.99 and repeating so we have now and these are in fact true 9.99 repeating equals 10. so we we can now express 10x as an integer which is a a rational number we can put 10 divided by 1 which is a ratio so another problem we have is terminating decimals if we have 2.78 equal to y then we can just easily say 278 divided by 100 equals y as well these are two integers and it's a it's another rational number so a convenient way to define these or is denoted with a q and this is called set builder notation we have the q equals the set containing elements a divided by b such that a and b are elements of the integers with the only condition that b cannot equal zero if you divide by zero uh it's it's undefined it doesn't mean anything so um if you're interested in that i recommend googling it i think it's interesting in this video i'll be giving an example of a nonrational number if the square root of 2 were a rational number then by definition it must be expressed as the ratio of two integers if we then square both sides we have two equals a squared divided by b squared if we multiply both sides by b squared we have 2b squared equals a squared and from this we know that a squared is even a squared is even because we have two times some integer which is b squared since a squared is even we know that a is even because a squared equals two times some integer the integer i chose was 2k squared that means that a times a can be expressed as 2k times 2k which is to say that a equals 2k i can now substitute 2 times 2k squared for a squared and that leaves us with b squared equals 2k squared once these twos cancel out now this also means that b squared is even because b squared equals 2 times some integer which is to say that b is also even following this same logic now if we go back to our original premise uh the square root of 2 equals a divided by b where a divided by b is an irreducible fraction but since a is an even number and b is also an even number we can express these numbers as 2k and 2l but these twos here will reduce meaning that we'll have the square root of 2 equals k divided by l but since this reduced since this is no longer explicitly represented as a divided by b and it reduced to k divided by l we know that we do not have a rational number now there's a more specific way to define these numbers or classify these numbers but we need set operators in the next video in this video i'll be defining four binary operators for sets i've defined two sets a and b to help give some examples so the first is a union b which equals a set containing elements p such that p is an element of a or p is an element of b the next is the intersection a intersection b equals the set containing elements p such that p is an element of a and p is an element of b the next is the set difference of a and b which equals the set containing p or elements p such that p is an element of a and p is not an element of b and finally we have the symmetric difference which is going to be very helpful when you actually complete the symmetric difference algorithm challenge so the symmetric difference of a and b equals the set difference of a and b union with the set difference of b and a and finally i will define the irrational numbers which i hinted to at the end of last video so the irrational numbers are simply the real number real numbers minus the rational numbers and that equals the irrational numbers in this video i will be using vent diagrams to give a graphical representation of the set operators we learned in the previous video so if you recall the definition of a union b you know that a union b equals the set containing elements x such that x is an element of a or x is an element of b so if we let this circle represent the set a and we let this circle represent the set b then that means that x can land anywhere in any of these circles which is why this right the entire region is shaded red we're saying that this red region represents all possible values of x and if we recall the definition of a of a intersection b that equals the set containing elements x such that x is an element of a and x is an element of b which is why the overlap where a and b overlap is is shaded red we're saying all possible values of x are this red region now the set difference of a and b equals the set containing elements x such that x is an element of a and x is also not an element of b which is why it's just this region here none of the elements are within b the set difference of b and a is the set containing elements x such that x is an element of b and x is not an element of a and finally the symmetric difference of a and b i defined as the union of a minus b and b minus a so we take uh this region in this region and we take the union of it which is why this is the resulting region there's no overlap between the two now this is a really good way to familiarize yourself with the concept of set operators however don't rely on it you should really focus on the definitions as it will help you out in the long term in this video i'll be introducing the concept of subsets and supersets the dots on the board here represent elements of a set the lines represent the sets themselves these lines have been labeled b a and u we can say that b is a subset of a because b contains because all elements of b are elements of a we can also say that b is a proper subset of a because all elements of b are elements of a and there are elements of a that are not within the set b we can also say that the set a is a superset of the set b because a contains all of the elements of b and being even more specific we can say that a is a proper superset of b because a contains all elements of b and there are elements of a that are not elements of b what we cannot say is that u is a proper subset of a although the circle here is bigger than a like it just takes up more space it doesn't contain any more elements so all the elements so u contains all elements of a however u does not contain any extra elements so u is a subset of a and a is actually a subset of u u is a superset of a and a is also a superset of u so the sets a and u in this case are actually equal in this video i'll be introducing the concept of the universal set and complements so i want to begin by talking about the universal set which is commonly referred to as the universe now the reason i use this fancy look in you here is that i was defining the universe which is to say the maximum boundaries of my set my biggest set everything outside of this blue circle here doesn't exist i mean it in terms of the sets nothing exists i don't even exist computer doesn't exist you don't exist but everything within it does so that's a very important key now if i don't define this if if i don't define my universal set then we just assume it to be the real numbers so if i just erase this then you know this will just be the real numbers which is we've talked about in previous videos so the other thing i want to talk about is complements so if i say if i'm looking for the complement of b and i'll i'll put a more formal definition of if i'm looking for the complement of b then it is everything that is not within b so all the elements not within b are going to be part of the c complement so in this case it would look like this if i just highlighted everything it would be everything within the universe still and then so that is the complement of b it's all the elements that are not in b so that's that's quite a bit of quite a bit i mean you've got one two three four five six seven so since this is the real numbers these little dots here would represent all the numbers all every single value rational irrational that are not within b so if this is one and two or better how about this this is the rational numbers and these are the integers so these would be everything outside of this would be the irrational numbers and the noninteger values in this video i'll be giving examples for subsets and supersets so if you look at this blue line here this represents our universal set uh we've defined it to be the integers from 1 to 11. that's 1 2 3 4 all the way up to 11. don't let it concern you that there are elements outside of our universe um that just means that they are i mean that just means they're not in the universe that we have in question right now so it's no different than having stars outside of your galaxy you're not concerned by that it's just a matter of fact so if you look at this green line uh what what set would that be well it can say it's elements three beta and gamma so does b b contains three beta and gamma so this would be the set b likewise this set here it contains elements three one and x well a contains three one and x so this is the set a and finally this set uh contains elements one and three this set contains elements one and three so this is the set c now what can be said about these sets well we have uh we can say that c is a subset of the universe because all elements of c are elements of the universe furthermore we can say that uh the set b is not a subset of the universe because there are elements of b that are not within the universe also we can say that the universe is not a subset a superset of a because there's elements of a that are not within or not contained by the universe and finally we can say that the universe is a proper superset of c because the universe contains all elements of c except and there are elements within the universe that are not within the set c so if we wanted to be more specific we could actually say that c is a proper subset of the universe in this video i'll be going over examples of complements so in this video i've defined the universe to be the integers one through five and it's denoted graphically by this blue line and if we recall the definition of uh the complements with or with regards to a we have a complement equals the set containing elements x such that x is an element of the universe and x is not an element of a so in that case we can look at uh all the integers one through five and if it contains any element from a we throw it out so in this case if we look at the integer 1 we know that that's not going to be there because that's an a if we look at the integer 2 that'll be in our set if we look at the integer 3 that won't be in our set because that's also an a and then 4 and 5 are within the universe and they're not with an a next we have b complement well we know that one two four and five are within the universe and they're not within uh b and lastly we have c complement two four and five are within the universe and they're not within c because we had to exclude one and three i want to begin this video by reviewing our definitions of the union and intersection after that i'll be introducing two algebraic laws for sets so the definition of a union b equals set containing elements x such that x is an element of a or x is an element of b also a intersection b is defined as the set containing elements x such that x is an element of a and x is an element of b so when i introduce the importance law it should be clear that a union a equals a because a union a is defined as the set containing elements x such that x is an element of a or x is an element of a which should yield or you should see why that equals the set a also a intersection a equals the set containing elements x such that x is an element of a and x is an element of a which it should also be clear why that is the set a next we have our identity laws so identity laws are laws where we have a given set and we're performing an operation on that set with a given element uh these elements are the identity elements so for this case we have the null set and the universal center are identity elements so a union null set equals a and by definition that means that a union null set equals the set containing elements x such that x is an element of a or x is an element of the null set but since we know that the null set is empty we can't possibly have any elements in there so it's really saying that a union the null set is equal to the set containing elements x such that x is an element of a or more simply it equals a i want to begin this video by reviewing the definition of complements so the definition of a complement of a set for for instance the complement of a equals the set containing elements x such that x is not an element of a i will now be going over two new algebraic laws for sets the first are the law of complements the law of complements states that if we take the union of a set and its complement it equals the universe or if you take the complement of the null set it equals the universe furthermore uh the intersection of a set and its complement is the null set and that should be clear because if you have uh the set a and you are intersecting it with everything that is not inside a there's clearly not going to be any overlap so you're going to have an empty set the next one is the law of involution so involution states that if we have a uh state here let's call it state zero and we feed that state to a function in this case we're going to feed it to the complement function then when it gets to state one if we again feed it through the exact same function the complement function it will result in state 0 again in this case if we fed state if we fed set a through this cyclical function here then we would have a feed it through a complement we get a complement feed it back through the function we get a complement complement which equals a and then we can have a complement complement complement which would be a complement and then you get the idea it's cyclical in this video i'm introducing two more algebraic laws for sets associativity and commutativity associativity is uh essentially just saying that we can regroup uh the sets that we are talking about so um a intersection b intersection c that is a intersecting with the set b intersection c is equal to the set a intersection b intersection c and if you look at the definitions of uh intersection you can actually go through and figure out why this is and i'm pretty sure you'll be able to do that based on the videos that uh you've already watched and the same is true for the union uh commutativity is essentially just saying that we can um switch which side our sets are relative to the the operation so a intersection b is the same thing as b intersection a and the same thing is a union b is equal to b union a so if we look at the actual definition we have a intersection b is defined as the set containing elements x such that x is an element of a and x is an element of b and that's going to equal the set containing elements x such that x is an element of b and x is an element of a so if you just look at these uh the conditions for these for the set builder notation here it's essentially just a uh argument of grammar at this point so uh basic english will tell you that you can just switch which side that you have these on in this video i'll be introducing another algebraic law of sets the distributive law the distributive law is simply saying that the set and operation will be distributed over another set in operation for instance a intersection b union c equals a intersection b union a intersection c so i thought it might be helpful to use uh venn diagrams for the conceptual idea of this and then i'll do a separate video on the actual definition so if we look at a here and we separate a and then we decide to separate b union c then when we actually go to find the union or the intersection of these two regions it's easy to see that it is this region so hopefully for the purposes of equality this region here will match this region here so let's get right to it we have a intersection b so we have the set a and the set b so that means that a intersection b is going to be this region here and we have to also find a intersection c so that's this region and if we take the union of those two regions then we're left with all this jazz so it looks like they are in fact equal but to be more rigorous we'll revisit the actual definition of the intersection in the unions in the next video in my previous video on subsets and supersets i stated that to show equality you have to prove that each side of an equation are are subsets of each other so to prove the distributive law we're going to have this video we're going to have the next video in this video i'm going to be showing that a is a a intersection b union c is a subset of a intersection b union a intersection c so let's start the proof suppose that x is an element of a intersection b union c then x is an element of a and x is an element of b union c by definition of the intersection so we still know that x is an element of a and by definition we know that x is an element of b or x is an element of c from this we can deduce that x is x is an element of a and x is an element of b or x is an element of a and x is an element of c now by definition we can put this or rewrite this as x as an element of a intersection b or x is an element of a intersection c and finally we can deduce that x is an element of a intersection b union a intersection c so there you have it we've shown that since x is an element of a intersection b union c and x is an element of a intersection b union a intersection c x is in both of these and therefore a intersection b union c is in fact a subset of a intersection b union a intersection c in this video i have the proof of the second case for the distributive law in this case we're showing that a intersection b union a intersection c is a subset of a intersection b union c so let's start by saying that suppose that x is an element of a intersection b union a intersection c then we know that x is an element of a intersection b or x is an element of a intersection c and we know this because of the definition of the union from here we can then state that x is an element of a and x is an element of b or x is an element of a and x is an element of c from that we can deduce that x is an element of a and x is an element of b or x is an element of c and here we um we sort of factored out the x as an element of a and and then regrouped x is element of b or x is an element of c and from here we can by definition right x is element of a and x is an element of b union c which finally we can state x's and elements of a intersection b union c which is what we wanted to show so there you have it we've proved that uh x is an element of both of these and therefore this is a subset of this and we've shown that both sides of the equation are subsets of each other and therefore the distributive law is in fact true it's proven this video i'll be going over an example of the distributive law so if you look at a intersection b unc that is supposed to equal a intersection b union a intersection c so if we can if we decompose this equation and look at uh let's start with a intersection b then that equals singleton 3 based off from these predetermined sets and then if we look at a intersection c that equals the set 1 3. so the union of these two is going to be the set containing elements 1 and 3. now if we look at b union c that equals the set containing elements 1 3 beta and gamma and if we take the intersection of that set with a we're left with a set containing elements one and three which is good because now we've shown that this is equal to that now if we look at a union b intersection c that's supposed to equal a union b intersection a union c so if we analyze b intersection c that equals singleton 3 and then a union b right here equals 1 3 x beta gamma and a union c equals the set containing elements 1 3 and x so when we take the intersection of these two sets we're left with the set containing elements 1 3 and x and when we take the union of b intersection c with a we're left with the second containing elements 1 3 and x which is exactly what we wanted so yeah we've shown that these are in fact true in this video i'll be introducing the very last algebraic law of sets known as de morgan's law de morgan's law was founded by augustus de morgan and it states that the complement of a union is the intersection of the complements or it says that the complement of the intersection is the union of the complements so we're going to prove that the uh complement of the union of a and b is is in fact equal to the uh complement of a intersected with the complement of b so to do this we have to show that the complement of a union b is a subset of a complement intersection b complement and vice versa so let's get started suppose that x is an element of a union b complement if that's the case then by definition x is not an element of a union b and if x is not an element of a union b that is if x is not an element of the region a union b which is the red here then surely x is not an element of a and x is not an element of b and if that's the case then by definition x is not an element of a complement and x is not an element of b complement therefore x is not an element of a complement intersection b complement so if we go to the other side here we start by saying let's let's suppose that x is an element of a complement intersection b complement then by definition x is an element of a complement and x is element of b complement by definition of the complements x is not an element of a and x is not an element of b and with the same logic x is not an element of a union b because x is not an element of this region and x is not an element of this region so surely it's not an element of the two regions combined and by definition of complements x is an element of a union b complement in this video in this video i'll be giving examples of de morgan's law de morgan's law states that the complement of the intersection equals the union of the complements and that the complement of the union equals the intersection of the complements so if we check out these new uh this new universal set here it is equal to the set containing integers such that x is greater than or equal to zero and x is less than or equal to five or more simply the universe equals the set containing integers from 0 to 5. so if we decompose our first equation a intersection b equals singleton 3 the complement of a intersection b is going to be integers from 0 to 5 excluding a intersection b so 0 1 2 4 and 5. now the complement of a is equal to 2 four and five because a contains the integers one and three so those are excluded and b complement is going to be equal to zero one two four five because b contains three so it's excluded so the intersection or the union rather of a complement in b complement equals 0 1 2 4 and 5 which is in fact equal to the complement of a intersection b which is what we wanted so the next equation we have a union b and that's equal to 1 3 x beta gamma now the complement of that is equal to 0 2 4 5 because we've excluded everything from uh a union b and now if we look at a complement intersection b complement we also have the set containing elements zero two four and five so which is exactly what we wanted so now we know that these two are equal so there you have it both of our equations worked out and we can happily use de morgan's law in this video i'll be explaining what logic is and why we need it i want to begin with an excerpt from the book of proof by richard hammack this is a free textbook and it's excellent you can find it online and it covers all foundational mathematics to include uh discrete mathematics and i i cannot recommend it enough so the excerpt is logic is a systematic way of thinking that allows us to deduce new information from old information and to parse the meaning of sentences so what this is saying is that essentially with without logic we wouldn't be able to deduce or move from point a to point b and or make claims from point a to point b in a hundred percent affirmative uh no questions asked way and uh so that so that's very important for mathematics if you couldn't do that in mathematics then um it would all fall apart you there there would be no certainty there would be no foundation no argument for us to stand on and we would just be a bunch of people throwing numbers about and making guesses essentially so it's very very important uh the parsing the other part of the quote to parse the meaning of sentences won't make sense until later videos when we actually um do that so just bear with me on that one so why should you care about programmers so well programmers use algorithms or well programmers write code first of all code uses algorithms algorithms is essentially just math and mathematics requires logic so it's that simple in this video i'll be introducing the notion of a proposition a proposition is simply a declarative statement with a verifiable truth value they are usually denoted by lowercase letters so if we have this lowercase p equals rain falls from the sky now that's a true statement rain does fall from this guy but it could have been a false statement like q q equals ghana is a country in asia ghana is not a country in asia ghana is a country in africa so this is a false proposition or a false statement are what are you doing there's no truth value that can be assigned to that it's just it's just a question it's considered an open statement s equals wash the laundry again this is an open statement it has no truth value to it it's a command five equals four plus eighty nine uh that again that that that does actually have a uh truth value to it uh but it's again it's a false state because 5 does not equal 4 plus 89. 7 equals alpha i i don't know if it does i mean i've no i don't know what alpha is so this is an open statement um we can't verify the truth of this 3 equals 5 divided by 0. this is a proposition this is how this has a truth value because 3 does not equal 5 divided by 0. that's 5 divided by 0 is undefined and then 99 times onethird equals 33. so this does have a verify verifiable truth value and it's true in this video i'll be introducing the concept of composite propositions just like regular propositions composite propositions are declarative statements with a verifiable truth value composite propositions are made up of subpropositions and in this video we're going to talk about the conjunction and the disjunction so the first one i want to introduce is the conjunction that is p and q that's how you would read this p and q and so this composite proposition here is rain falls from the sky and ghana is a country in asia so the two subpropositions in this would be p p and q um and this has a verifiable truth value because rain falls from the sky because that is a true statement but the statement q ghana is a country in asia is false we have p and q we have true and false which means that it's false one of them is false and we'll talk about this more when we get into truth tables the next is the disjunction p or q that's read as or rain falls from the sky or ghana is a country in asia so again we have true or false this time so only one of these need to be true in order for everything to be true and therefore p or q is a true statement in this video i'll be introducing truth tables truth tables are the easiest way to visualize why something is true or false and they're really convenient when we start getting up into uh conjunctions and disjunctions so if you remember p and q p is defined as rain falls from the sky and q is ghana is a country in asia then p or q or both p and q have two possible values true or false they're primitive propositions so we just put them in a table true and false and then true or false but i i circled these because i know that p is true and i know that q is false but when i analyze a conjunction or disjunction i have to add two more rows to the truth table and that's because if you like if you imagine this as starting on a path here you can choose to go either true or false when it say i took true when i get to the end of that path i can then choose true or false again so i'm stuck with four different possibilities here the first one being true true true false and then false true and then false false so when i actually go to my table here i have true true true false and yada yada and then uh when i stick in my conjunction i have true and true equals true uh true and false equals false true false and true equals false and then false and false equals false p or q true or true equals true true or false equals true false or true equals true and false or false equals false and these are by the definitions of the conjunction and the disjunction that's why that's why these values take on true or false in this video i'll introduce our first two algebraic laws of logic in importance and identities these are the same laws we saw in set theory if you recall it impotence is when you can take a proposition and apply a binary operator to that proposition over and over and will never change the value of the original proposition for instance p is the logical equivalent that's what these mean the logical equivalent of p or p which is the logical equivalent of p and p and if you recall the definition of uh the disjunction and the conjunction you should be able to figure out why this occurs now the i identity law states that if we take a proposition and we have a conjunction with true a truth value a true value then it will always yield that original proposition likewise if we have a disjunction with a proposition and false it will always yield the original proposition that's why we have p is the logical equivalent of p or false which is the logical equivalent of p and true and uh finally we have uh true and false the identities of true and false so if you have the disjunction of true with any proposition then you will always yield a true value and if you have a conjunction with any proposition in false it will always yield the false value in this video i'll be introducing two more algebraic laws of logic the law of complements in the law of involution we start by examining our primitive proposition p we know that p either is true or false if we look at the negation of p which is read as not p then we know that p is false and true because not p is defined as when p is true not p is false and when p is false not p is true so the law of involution tells us that if we have a proposition and we feed it through a function twice we'll end up in the same spot so if we have proposition p starting at state zero feed it through a function the negation function it'll bring us to state one as not p if we feed not p through the function it'll bring us back to state zero which is p or known as not not p so uh p is logically equivalent to not not p that's what involution tells us we then analyze the law of complements which tells us that the uh disjunction of p and its negation not p will be the logical equivalent of the true value so it is a it is known as a tautology it is always true uh and that's the corresponding truth table here it also tells us that uh a proposition and the conjunction of its negation is always false which is known as a fallacy so you can go through this truth table and you'll see that we have a tautology fallacy tautology tautology fallacy and fallacy in this video i'll be introducing another algebraic law of logic commutative law so we start by looking at all possible cases of p and q we know that based on the path problem that we did when i first introduced truth tables we know that there's four possible cases for both the disjunction and the conjunction of p and q so if we analyze this we know that true and true for the disjunction of p and q is going to yield true and also this is going to be true and false yields true false and true yields true and false and falsies it's true so all we're doing for the commutative law is switching the order of q and p on the operation so instead of having p or q we have q or p so in fact we do have true true true faults so we've shown that both p or q and q or p are logically equivalent for the conjunction of p and q by definition we know that true and true is going to yield true true and false yields false false and true yields false and false and false yields false so when we commute p and q and we have q and p it's not surprising that we get the exact same answer which is good because now we've shown that p and q is logically equivalent to q and p in this video i'll be introducing the associative law and the distributive law for logic now previously we've only dealt with two primitive propositions so that's why we've only ever had four possible outcomes in our true or false path now we're going to take this a step further and we're going to have eight propositions or eight possible outcomes for our true or false path because we're dealing with three propositions p q and r so there's not much to be said about the uh associative law or the distributive law and unfortunately i can't fit the truth table to prove these on my white board it's it and it gets really messy so i'm gonna have them at the end of the video and go through them make sure you understand them and if you don't go back and review the concepts of truth tables in this video i'll be introducing our last algebraic law of logic de morgan's law de morgan's law states that the negation of the conjunction is the logical equivalent of the disjunction of the negations and also that the negation of the disjunction is the logical equivalent of the conjunction of the negations so if we look at our truth table i've decomposed our propositions here so that we have p not p q not q and i have it all out on the board so that i can just simply look at uh not p and q which is our first law and see that it is in fact equivalent to not p or not q so these two columns are equal so we can uh definitively say that these are logical equivalents also not p or q is the is in fact not p and not q based on our truth table it's 100 certain it's this is logic and there's uh no argument against it in this video i'll be introducing the notion of conditional statements a conditional statement contains a hypothesis and a conclusion these are more formally known as an antecedent and a consequent so all this is saying is that when we look at these the actual conditional this is the hypothesis and this is a conclusion so p implies this is read as p implies q and also as if p then q so p implies q is only false when a hypothesis leads to a a false conclusion or a uh antecedent leads to leads to a false consequence so that's why we have uh if we have true implies true that leads to a true statement and if we have true uh implies false that leads to a false statement these other three the converse inverse and contra contrapositive are uh essentially they're just common implications that we run into or common uh conditional statements that we run into and the converse is simply q implies p uh inverse is not p implies not q and not q implies not p is log which is contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement in this video i'll be introducing the universal and existential quantifiers but first i have to introduce the propositional function the propositional function denoted p of x takes on a value of true or false but it takes on a value of true or false for everything that you feed to it so in this case with the universal quantifier this is read as for every you would say for every x that is an element of the universe p of x is either true or false for every x uh the shorthand for this is for every x p of x you could also say uh there exists that's the existential quantifier there exists is just stating that there is at least one so if we say there exists an uh there exists an x that is an element of the universe we're saying there is at least one x at least one x that is an element of the universe such that p of x is true or false and you can again use the shorthand uh there exists an x p of x so we look at these examples for every x that is an element of the naturals x plus 3 is greater than 4. so that is a that is a false statement because the first value of the natural numbers is 1 so x plus 3 is 4 which is not greater than 4. also for every x is an element of the real numbers x plus 3 is greater than 4. that is also false i can think of well there are infinitely many numbers that are not true for this and then in this case i said there does not exist an x that is now under the naturals such that x plus 3 is greater than 4. and that is also a false statement because if i let x equal 2 that 2 is a natural number and 2 plus 3 is greater than 4 so this is a false statement there exists an element of the real numbers such that x plus 3 is greater than 4. that is a true statement because any number greater than one is going to yield a true statement in this case in this video i'm going to be going over some examples of tautologies tautologies are simply propositions that are always true this first one is the law of excluded middle which is p or not p so for here we have p or not p so true or false true or false false or true or false are true which yields nothing but a true column next we have the law of contradiction so if you ignore this negation here in this column of trues here we have p and not p so true and false sealed false true and false yields false false and true false and true all yield false now when we actually apply this negation to the uh false column here that yields a column of truths so the law of contradiction is a tautology finally we have modus tollens modus tollens is p implies q and not q implies not p so let's break this down p implies q p implies q is only ever negative when the hypothesis predicts true and the conclusion is false so if we have uh true implies true here is going to be true true implies false that's false false implies true is going to be true false implies false that's also false i mean that's also true we then take this column and uh take a conjunction with not q so true and not false is going to yield false false and true is going to yield false again false and true is going to yield false and true and true is going to yield true so finally we take this column here and that is our we imply not p so this column implies not p so false implying not p is going to be true false implying false is going to be true false implying true is also true and true implying true is also true so there you have it we have this whole column here for modus tollens and that is therefore a tautology there's nothing special about these tautologies these are just examples of tautologies
