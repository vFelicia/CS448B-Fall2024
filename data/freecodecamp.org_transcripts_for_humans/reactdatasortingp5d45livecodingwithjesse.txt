00:03 - hey everyone welcome to live coding with
00:06 - Jessie I'm Jessie and today we're going
00:08 - to keep working on that search page that
00:11 - we've been working on for a while now
00:14 - but we're gonna move on to something new
00:17 - we're gonna work on the sorting which we
00:20 - just started to get into at the end of
00:23 - yesterday stream so now I'd like to
00:25 - spend a little bit of time and try to
00:27 - actually get it working I'm going to
00:34 - start out let's see I'll just check in
00:40 - analytics make sure we had some people
00:41 - in here before I start out and give my
00:45 - my usual opening statement I think the
00:49 - analytics is a little bit behind this I
00:51 - know we have more people waiting but for
00:57 - those of you who are new we in this
01:03 - sorry so if you're new in this stream
01:07 - you get to watch me do my daily work as
01:10 - a front-end developer for a small
01:12 - university I don't rehearse this
01:15 - beforehand so there will be mistakes and
01:17 - that's kind of the point is that you get
01:20 - to see a full-time developer make
01:24 - mistakes and work through those mistakes
01:26 - my hope is that if you're new to web
01:31 - development or to programming in general
01:33 - you'll see that it's okay to make
01:35 - mistakes you know everybody makes
01:37 - mistakes at least I do a lot and you
01:43 - know you just work through and you keep
01:44 - going and we also have some very
01:48 - experienced developers that watch as
01:50 - well and they can provide some useful
01:52 - help in the live chat so if you can
01:54 - watch it live
01:55 - and ask questions in the chat you'll get
01:57 - some good answers you know most of the
01:59 - time we break everything up by Pomodoro
02:04 - sessions so Pomodoro session is 25
02:07 - minutes so we'll do 25 minutes of code
02:09 - we'll take a five-minute break and we'll
02:11 - chat in the live chat a bit
02:13 - and then 25 minutes of code and then at
02:15 - the end of the show that's when we do
02:17 - most of the question and answers so if
02:19 - you ask a question please be patient and
02:22 - we'll get to it at the end of the show
02:23 - the show is available to watch as a
02:26 - recording you know right after the
02:28 - stream so you know at any point in the
02:31 - future if you want to come back to it or
02:33 - you can't catch the whole thing now you
02:35 - know don't worry about it you can just
02:37 - watch later on whenever you have a
02:39 - chance okay cool so it looks like we
02:41 - have our normal number of viewers in
02:43 - here now so I'm gonna switch screens so
02:47 - y'all can see what I see we will be
02:50 - working in our search j/s file if you
02:52 - check the description for this video
02:54 - there will be a link to the github repo
02:56 - and the github repo is up to date let's
03:00 - double check and make sure we'll do a
03:04 - get pool right everything's up to date
03:06 - here
03:07 - I always like to start out my work by
03:09 - doing a git pull to make sure there
03:11 - aren't any changes that haven't you know
03:14 - made their way down locally yet it's a
03:17 - pain to start working and then realize
03:18 - that you don't have all the code I'm
03:21 - also going to bring the Pomodoro timer
03:25 - over here and we're going to start it
03:26 - and I'm gonna start the end rock server
03:30 - as well and then that way you all can
03:33 - see what I'm seeing on my screen and you
03:37 - can click around and test the site on
03:39 - your own so here's the end Rock link
03:43 - coming into the live chat right now and
03:48 - alright John Hanson and the chap
03:50 - mentioned that the chat is saved yeah
03:52 - second I saw at least yesterday's video
03:55 - had the chat saved so if you watch the
03:58 - replay you will be able to see what's
03:59 - going on the chat I think that's really
04:01 - nice I mean I've tried my best to try to
04:04 - read out things in the chat but I know I
04:06 - missed something sometimes so now you'll
04:09 - be able to keep up with everything
04:11 - that's going on the chat it for those of
04:13 - you who can't watch live I think that
04:15 - will really help you to be able to
04:17 - understand you know kind of the
04:19 - back-and-forth between you
04:21 - those of you in the in the live chat now
04:26 - okay
04:30 - rut Rajesh I see your question we'll get
04:33 - to that on the first break okay so if
04:35 - you could just hang on for a little bit
04:37 - at the end of this twenty five minutes
04:40 - I'll get to that question if anyone the
04:42 - live chat wants to address the question
04:44 - of how to start out learning to code and
04:46 - react you know please put the answers in
04:49 - there now for Ruud Rajesh or Rajesh I'm
04:53 - sorry I'm not sure how to pronounce that
05:01 - okay then Nicky says there was a pull
05:04 - request for the search page so let's
05:07 - check that out Melvin so the first part
05:10 - may just be taking care of this pull
05:13 - request
05:21 - okay let's see the notifications okay
05:29 - let's check that out so if you're not
05:36 - familiar with how to manage projects
05:38 - through github this will be kind of a
05:40 - good you know good little intro to
05:44 - merging pull requests so we get a pull
05:47 - request in and whatever usually you have
05:51 - a description if somebody submits pull
05:53 - requests in the description then not
05:55 - it's probably not likely to get merged
05:58 - so updated State in an immutable way in
06:01 - the only change handler for checkboxes
06:03 - only called creates search sites after
06:05 - set state is complete okay cool so Niki
06:11 - I'm not gonna read these right now on
06:12 - the chat I don't I don't know why I
06:16 - didn't see this PR you know now I
06:20 - remember when the notification came up
06:21 - for this and I was at a meeting this
06:23 - morning for a few hours so that's
06:28 - probably why I didn't remember it after
06:30 - the meeting ended
06:31 - so let's now that we read what it's
06:34 - about I always go in and check the files
06:37 - to see what changed exactly so on the
06:41 - left hand side this is what was there
06:45 - before the right hand side are the
06:47 - changes so here's our handle change
06:51 - function before and now before we were
06:57 - reading the variable for checkboxes
07:03 - sorry I'm not feeling well so if I'm
07:06 - coughing or sneezing I apologize in
07:08 - advance so let's see just a teeth on
07:15 - search alright so now I'm not as worried
07:19 - about explaining what we did cuz we did
07:22 - this on a stream so let's go
07:29 - okay so we're getting the previous state
07:32 - so when you go to do set state you you
07:35 - can have get the previous state here you
07:40 - don't usually need it but it does come
07:42 - in handy sometimes and now we're
07:45 - returning checkboxes previous state
07:49 - check boxes okay Nikki that's a great
07:54 - idea now I remember you saying that in
07:56 - the live chat and for whatever reason I
07:58 - didn't implement it then but just to
08:00 - explain what's going on here
08:02 - so we're returning check boxes so we're
08:15 - gonna set the state of check boxes and
08:18 - the new state of check boxes is going to
08:21 - be everything from the old State
08:23 - combined with one of the check boxes
08:28 - being checked so whatever one we just
08:29 - clicked on will be checked okay so you
08:33 - see these three dots in front of here so
08:35 - this is already all the check boxes here
08:41 - and we're just combining it so it's a
08:44 - way to combine in this case what do we
08:46 - have an object yeah it's a combined
08:50 - objects really easily in a concise way
08:55 - what is that the spread operator is that
08:58 - what that's called
08:59 - it's an es6 thing so I believe it's
09:01 - spread operator let me know in the live
09:05 - chat if that's the wrong name for it but
09:09 - if you look up ESX spread operator then
09:11 - you should be able to find a lot more
09:13 - info on on how to use this and when it's
09:16 - appropriate to use it all right and then
09:19 - after that we're gonna create the search
09:22 - types and if you're not sure what that's
09:26 - doing it's it's okay it's just calling
09:27 - off a function and then this function is
09:30 - actually going to run the search so if
09:32 - you check out the stream yesterday you
09:34 - can learn a lot more about what these
09:36 - functions are doing but for now just
09:39 - know that
09:40 - once the checkbox is checked the last
09:43 - thing that's going to happen is it's
09:45 - actually going to search okay so I am
09:48 - getting confirmation that it was the
09:50 - spread operator so that is the right
09:52 - word for it so it's it's really really
09:57 - useful so if you find yourself needing
09:59 - to do things with with objects with
10:01 - combining objects and things check it
10:03 - out alright wonderful you know that Niki
10:07 - this looks great
10:08 - I'm not I'm not even gonna test this out
10:11 - first I'm just going to merge it because
10:13 - it's really evident what this does and I
10:18 - think we're safe to just merge it you
10:21 - don't always want to just merge
10:22 - something if it's a small change like
10:24 - this and really you know kind of
10:26 - well-done and obvious to see what's
10:28 - happening
10:29 - I'm usually okay with just merging it
10:32 - but anything really bigger than this
10:34 - you'll want to test first and I do have
10:38 - some videos where I've tested things so
10:39 - if you go if you go back and search
10:41 - through my videos and find one on like
10:45 - merging pool requests
10:47 - that'll I think I go through the whole
10:50 - process of testing I'd like to make a
10:52 - video on on my own channel which there's
10:55 - a link in description for my own channel
10:56 - so I'd like to make a short to the point
11:00 - video on merging for people that don't
11:04 - want to sift through all the hours of
11:06 - live streams and they just wanted me to
11:08 - get to the point I'm gonna make a video
11:11 - for those for those people in for people
11:13 - who just don't have time to watch the
11:14 - stream so I think I'm gonna make that
11:17 - somewhat soon still watch out for that
11:21 - I'll tell you all when I when I do make
11:23 - it if you're interested so now since I
11:26 - I've decided I do want to merge this all
11:30 - I have to do is go here and go to merge
11:32 - pull request nice I'm going to confirm
11:34 - the merge now you can do you thinks
11:38 - through the command line but this is in
11:41 - my opinion the fastest way to do it if
11:43 - you know you want to merge it right away
11:46 - I always leave a comment
11:50 - I always want to show my appreciation
11:54 - for those of you that do submit pull
12:00 - requests and if you're maintaining a
12:07 - repository and github I also recommend
12:10 - that you show your appreciation and
12:12 - encouragement for those who who do
12:14 - submit pull requests I know for me like
12:17 - especially when I was starting out it
12:19 - could be very very intimidating to
12:21 - submit pull requests and you know kind
12:24 - of being ignored or having some harsh
12:27 - words can really did demoralize you so
12:30 - just be aware of that you know when
12:33 - you're a maintainer new people
12:36 - especially like really look up to you
12:37 - and if they care enough about your
12:40 - project to want to you know submit a
12:43 - pull request they may have put a lot of
12:46 - time into it even if it doesn't seem
12:47 - like it because if they're beginner it
12:49 - may taken a long time for them to do
12:51 - even something basic so you know a word
12:54 - of encouragement from you could really
12:56 - you know kind of give them that
12:59 - motivation to increase their skills but
13:02 - you know a mean word could kind of crush
13:05 - their spirit you know they may be the
13:07 - last straw for them so you know I'm not
13:10 - saying that you're entirely responsible
13:12 - for their their whole career but you
13:15 - know just be aware of that for me on
13:18 - both sides of it that's just you know
13:21 - kind of what I've seen ok we need to now
13:25 - pull those changes down oops let me make
13:29 - this bigger I'm sorry about that
13:30 - that was so small before all right so
13:33 - we're gonna do a get pool again and
13:39 - those changes that we just merged in on
13:42 - github are now local in our search that
13:46 - jazz file so let's scroll down just to
13:50 - see handle change what's going on
13:57 - it's not showing me it don't say let me
14:03 - just open it up again
14:09 - there we are sometimes it doesn't
14:13 - automatically change for me so I have to
14:16 - reopen the file but now you can see that
14:21 - here's all the changes and definitely
14:23 - want to verify that everything still
14:25 - works I mean based on what we saw in the
14:26 - code it should still work but it's good
14:28 - to get to try it out so let's go with
14:35 - good to know we have a theology major
14:38 - wonderful let's make sure that you know
14:45 - we have Department there's nobody with
14:50 - four faculty there we go okay it was
14:54 - working wonderful
15:03 - okay great so these are working now and
15:15 - alright here's the next step then let's
15:19 - now we have a check boxes you know
15:22 - working we definitely want to add more
15:24 - check boxes but for now we're just kind
15:27 - of getting everything working and then
15:30 - we can fill in you know however many
15:33 - check boxes or sorting things that we
15:35 - need later on we still don't have all
15:37 - the data over so I don't really know how
15:40 - many check boxes we need until I get all
15:42 - that data over so now I'd like to go
15:47 - back to where we left off at yesterday
15:50 - with our sorting I believe where did we
15:55 - put this sorting they we are so we have
15:59 - this function here it's a sort by type
16:03 - and let's just briefly review what we've
16:06 - done so for those of you that watched
16:07 - yesterday you know just bear with me as
16:11 - I repeat this because I'm sure there are
16:13 - people that that didn't see it so we're
16:19 - gonna call this sort by function
16:23 - whenever a user clicks on I guess it'll
16:29 - be will be a drop-down or radio I
16:31 - haven't I don't know exactly what kind
16:33 - of input we'll do either a radio or a
16:37 - drop-down so I guess so let's just think
16:42 - about that for the next few minutes as
16:44 - I'm going over this and let me know what
16:46 - you think would be better for this type
16:49 - of thing so first we're gonna do a check
16:53 - to see if the data that we've gotten is
16:58 - equal to 100 so what we're getting data
17:05 - from wordpress from the wordpress api
17:08 - they the max amount of posts that we can
17:12 - get from the wordpress api is 100
17:16 - so we know if we've gotten 100 posts and
17:22 - we want to do a sort we need to actually
17:25 - do another search and do the sorting in
17:28 - WordPress and then get the sorted data
17:31 - you know because if our search would
17:35 - normally return 500 posts and we only
17:38 - have a hundred right now we haven't
17:39 - gotten the rest of them and then we sort
17:41 - those hundred then when it's not going
17:46 - to give the result that the user really
17:47 - expects or needs right if it's
17:50 - alphabetical you know and we're starting
17:54 - with a there's going to be a lot of
17:56 - other stuff that starts with a that is
17:58 - in that you know other 400 posts that we
18:02 - haven't even gotten yet so the sorting
18:05 - is going to be messed up and we need all
18:09 - right Nikki what's the end grog link all
18:11 - right I posted it once let's post it
18:15 - again sorry about that Nikki so that's
18:21 - why we have that check so that may or
18:24 - may not make sense I think I did a
18:26 - better job of explaining it yesterday
18:28 - because we were actually getting the
18:29 - data and things but basically we need
18:32 - that check to make sure that we we do
18:34 - end up returning the correct data to the
18:36 - user the other check we're going to make
18:38 - is if the data equals zero if the data
18:45 - equals zero then this probably means
18:48 - that a search has not occurred yet so
18:52 - it's very I don't even know if it's
18:55 - possible the search would not have
18:57 - occurred yet and the user is actually
18:59 - clicking these sorting things and
19:01 - there's actually something in the the
19:06 - search bar but I threw that in there
19:08 - just in case we may be able to remove
19:10 - this if as we build this out we realized
19:13 - that this is an impossible scenario
19:15 - we'll remove it but better safe than
19:19 - sorry on that it's just a little extra
19:21 - thing so in any case we just do another
19:26 - we do another search so first we set the
19:28 - state
19:30 - sort by to our type so this is the type
19:34 - of sorting that we're passing in and
19:37 - then we do this this search so we
19:42 - haven't added in like are sorting right
19:47 - so we need to do that today else so if
19:53 - the data if the number of posts we have
19:58 - in in-state is greater than 1 greater
20:04 - than 0 but less than 100 then we come
20:06 - down here and we just do a sort on the
20:08 - data we already have and we don't make
20:10 - another API call which will definitely
20:13 - save resources it'll save time it'll
20:17 - save the users bandwidth ok so this is a
20:29 - data sorted okay and then we just
20:31 - changed the order of the data then state
20:36 - and since this is react we change state
20:38 - everything gets rear-ended so the user
20:40 - will immediately see all that data that
20:43 - they were seeing before but now it's
20:44 - going to be sorted the way they want it
20:46 - so let's let's build out this sorting
20:51 - function and I think we had did we find
21:01 - an example at the end of the stream I
21:09 - can't remember I don't think I pasted
21:15 - one the copy and paste one I mainly
21:19 - remember trying to find an example then
21:23 - I apologize again like my mind is just
21:26 - fuzzy I'm definitely starting to get
21:28 - sick so I'm gonna do my best in this
21:32 - stream but I know I'm gonna mess some
21:35 - things up
21:38 - what is this resources oh okay
21:42 - now I remember we searched in here I
21:44 - thought that I had some sorting
21:46 - happening in here
21:47 - but then after searching through this I
21:49 - realized that I didn't have sorting did
21:54 - we have sorting what project did we have
21:59 - it in all right let me check one other
22:02 - project if it's not in this other one
22:04 - then we'll come up with it on our own
22:05 - but we could potentially save us a lot
22:07 - of time if we can just use something
22:09 - we've used before bulletin
22:12 - I think the bulletin react project
22:16 - possibly has it let's see
22:35 - who
22:42 - not there
23:06 - okay all right so we're doing some
23:08 - searching here okay cool so we're doing
23:18 - a filter by dates but I don't think
23:29 - we're doing this client-side this
23:34 - project is still unfinished okay so
23:43 - let's let's just go over here then and
23:53 - I'm trying to think of so we're gonna
23:59 - have four different types of sorting you
24:08 - know what I remember where I've done
24:10 - this before
24:19 - I'm pretty sure that I've done this this
24:22 - exact type of sorting before I just
24:26 - can't remember if I did a client-side or
24:27 - server-side so let me find it okay
24:45 - let's see where they did in reducers
24:58 - give a set sorting alright shouldn't out
25:05 - sort by
25:14 - okay maybe I did the sorting in the
25:16 - component then so this is a project
25:18 - that's using react and redux so if
25:20 - you're not familiar with redux then some
25:22 - of this will probably look really weird
25:23 - all these projects that I've been
25:25 - searching through are completely
25:26 - open-source they're available on my
25:29 - github repo or my github profile so you
25:32 - can check them out if you want to know
25:34 - more about it this was one that I did
25:36 - for the Udacity react nanodegree this
25:39 - was project two so let's see the views
25:48 - let's see if I have this and you sold my
25:51 - bringing in the sorting sort great okay
25:58 - side nav sort by I know of another one
26:03 - yes yes all right cool all right so I
26:08 - found it yeah Wow I knew I had done this
26:16 - before with react so we're not using
26:20 - Redux in our current project so the way
26:24 - we implement this will be slightly
26:26 - different so instead of getting values
26:29 - from redux we're gonna get our values
26:31 - directly from state it should be fine
26:34 - the search page is just one page I'm
26:38 - okay with just using state instead of
26:41 - using Redux
26:42 - we may find down the line that we have a
26:45 - lot more going on and maybe we should
26:47 - use Redux we can always switch over that
26:49 - at that time or something like Redux
26:54 - you know something you know built-in
26:56 - with Apollo so we're doing we are doing
27:01 - some filtering here that we don't need
27:03 - to do and our project but here's the
27:05 - actual sort so we have a switch
27:12 - statement and this allows us to sort for
27:16 - multiple different types of sorting all
27:18 - which is one dot sort I think this is
27:21 - what we'll go with
27:22 - this is a lot cleaner than having lots
27:24 - of different
27:25 - functions to sort you know we just can
27:29 - have one so the switch statement takes
27:33 - in this prop sort by which in our case
27:34 - will be this state sort by well even use
27:38 - the same subconsciously I think I
27:41 - remember this because I even use the
27:43 - same name for it but in the case by
27:48 - score lowest we have dates so that date
27:52 - will actually be one so we can do date
27:54 - oldest so in this case we're returning
27:56 - aid timestamp minus B dot timestamp okay
28:01 - and that will that'll sort this by the
28:06 - oldest date so the oldest date is going
28:11 - to be the like less than right so dates
28:20 - being like just a big long number okay
28:25 - so that's the default here so we're
28:27 - gonna have to return a default we'll
28:28 - figure out what the default ought to be
28:30 - what the user will expect I'm thinking
28:32 - newest first might be what what's
28:34 - expected so we'll have to maybe we'll
28:42 - have to think about that and then
28:45 - replace what needs replaced and then
28:47 - we'll try out our sorting okay let's see
28:56 - okay so right reg s okay well we had a
29:03 - question before that Wow there were some
29:05 - of you were here a half hour early so
29:07 - Divya says already waiting last night
29:10 - you left at some place to explain please
29:12 - explain that again okay let me know
29:15 - Divya what I was explaining so I did go
29:19 - back and explain some of what we were
29:20 - doing yesterday but I may not have
29:23 - explained exactly what you needed so
29:25 - please let me know and I'll try to
29:27 - explain
29:28 - and then Rajesh says I'm new to react
29:31 - can you suggest me a way to start coding
29:33 - and react I'm sure you've probably
29:36 - gotten some other answers down lower in
29:38 - the
29:38 - live-chat so sorry if I'm repeating but
29:41 - the react documentation is a nice place
29:45 - to start the if you want to pay for a
29:51 - course the Udacity react nano degree I
29:54 - took that course myself I learned a lot
29:57 - from it so I think that's a good one to
30:00 - do I think who is it west west boss I
30:04 - have never done any of his courses with
30:06 - w es BOS okay so look that up he does a
30:11 - lot of courses like I said I haven't
30:13 - done any so I can't say from personal
30:15 - experience but a lot of people really
30:17 - like his courses I'm gonna have to try
30:20 - stuff out one day you know just because
30:23 - I've heard so many good things about it
30:25 - those resources should be pretty decent
30:29 - to get you started I'm sure there's a
30:30 - lot of other good resources out there I
30:32 - just haven't seen them yet see a lot a
30:42 - lot of you were saying hi so hey Amit
30:47 - says write some code that was at the
30:51 - beginning when I was going over my intro
30:52 - so I haven't actually written that much
30:56 - code yet so we're gonna get to some code
31:00 - sometimes that's how it is though
31:02 - programming is a lot of thinking and
31:04 - looking things up and reviewing code you
31:08 - know what I actually typed that much
31:11 - some days we type a lot some days we
31:13 - don't let's see more of you saying hi
31:19 - I'm not gonna go through every one
31:20 - individually but I do see all of your
31:22 - names so hello everyone
31:40 - the the garv man I'm messing up his name
31:44 - bar Bhargav bah aaargh av really sorry
31:52 - I'm sure messing up your name let me
31:54 - know I should pronounce it says why
31:55 - don't you try at Google my bro
32:02 - I'm not exactly sure you mean like try
32:04 - to work at Google I did apply to a job
32:08 - at Google in Pittsburgh a while ago so
32:13 - that would be cool but I'm sure a lot of
32:16 - really really good developers apply it
32:18 - to any jobs at Google so that'd be a
32:21 - long shot for me
32:30 - okay so Ahmad also recommends West bus
32:35 - so the courses react for beginners so
32:39 - thank you for that Ahmad
33:01 - all right so divya says start with react
33:06 - tutorials from net ninja and learn
33:08 - Codecademy oh you know what i forgot
33:11 - about learning code academy
33:13 - that's a youtube channel I did learn a
33:16 - lot about react from that YouTube
33:18 - channel and about get and a lot of other
33:20 - things the channels not updated
33:23 - regularly anymore so some of what you
33:25 - see in those videos will be a little
33:27 - outdated but it's it's like
33:29 - fundamentally still pretty good so so
33:34 - yeah definitely check out that that
33:36 - channel 1-0 says reduce mic volume is my
33:42 - mic is it too loud I mean I'd hate to I
33:47 - mean for all I said if it's too loud
33:49 - then maybe just turn down the video cuz
33:51 - I don't want to turn it down and then
33:53 - mess it up for everybody else so let me
33:55 - know I mean if everybody's saying it's
33:57 - too loud then maybe I'll turn it down
33:59 - but I'd rather have it too loud for some
34:01 - and then give them the ability to turn
34:04 - it down on their own machines because if
34:07 - it's too low for people you can't you
34:10 - know they can't do anything about that
34:13 - okay so it didn't make it through
34:16 - everything in the live chat I will come
34:19 - back and finish up with all the
34:21 - questions in the live chat
34:22 - after after we finish up with this
34:28 - Pomodoro session so now let's grab this
34:33 - sort let's see we need this too
34:44 - Wow am I actually doing the map as well
34:47 - yeah I am well okay all right so where
34:57 - we get our swords let's put it here okay
35:02 - so this state data sword
35:09 - okay so we're sorting that we're saving
35:12 - it to the variable sort of data and
35:16 - instead of this props we want this state
35:26 - sort by and actually we do we need this
35:30 - states whereby no we don't we don't need
35:33 - to grab it here because we already we're
35:36 - pulling in the type so let's just get
35:38 - the type it'll save us a few characters
35:45 - so we can probably refactor this a good
35:48 - bit after we get finished with it but
35:49 - let's just get it working first so our
35:53 - cases here are gonna be different I
35:57 - don't want to go with these all caps I
35:58 - mean that's that was the way to do it
36:00 - with with Redux but I don't want it
36:05 - hopes what did I do
36:06 - I don't want to do it like that here so
36:10 - this is vote score so we don't want
36:13 - those four we want
36:20 - give an alphabetical order so actually
36:23 - let's just change our let's make sure
36:29 - we're actually getting a timestamp with
36:32 - this data or what it is yeah we are
36:37 - getting we're getting all of the data
36:43 - back right okay let me look here we are
36:51 - okay so here's the data that we're
36:54 - getting in the format all right so
36:58 - here's the date let's make sure that
37:01 - there aren't any other dates that would
37:02 - be more appropriate to use okay so
37:08 - here's the day should we change the date
37:11 - then probably we're probably going to
37:19 - need to manipulate this date first but
37:23 - at least we know we can we can get that
37:25 - date and then title is what we use for
37:29 - the alphabetical order stuff so title
37:32 - rendered okay
37:51 - this is gonna be a dots everywhere
37:54 - instead of timestamp we're just gonna
37:56 - say date for now well we're probably
38:04 - gonna have to change this but we'll just
38:08 - save it there for now we may need to
38:15 - yeah I'm not gonna get ahead of myself
38:17 - let's just keep going here so we don't
38:20 - have a vote score but we won't need to
38:22 - make this let's go with I don't rendered
38:35 - and then let's just put these in so I
38:37 - remember what it is so instead of us who
38:43 - are lowest this will be alpha
38:54 - that's ending and this is gonna be alpha
38:59 - descending is our default I don't want
39:02 - that to be our default that will change
39:03 - it but not right now
39:04 - date by oldest just call this dates
39:17 - newest date all the stateless
39:25 - okay and this is the type
39:50 - this should be outside the if-statement
39:57 - okay because no matter what we need to
40:00 - change the sort that's we're tight okay
40:08 - actually
40:19 - all right I got some other ideas for how
40:24 - this can be refactored buzz I need to
40:26 - focus and not keep getting ahead of
40:27 - myself
40:30 - let's see it's for now I just want to
40:50 - return is this this is gonna save to
40:56 - data right this sort data and then it's
41:03 - gonna set State okay so we should be
41:05 - able to just check this as long as we
41:07 - check data to see if it's doing anything
41:09 - I want to check and see if any of these
41:13 - will work as is I don't have high hopes
41:16 - that they will oh let's say Nikki in the
41:22 - live chat has something for I so day two
41:26 - UNIX epoch due date for ashore I sewed a
41:30 - string oh cool awesome so let's let's do
41:33 - that now
41:34 - so within
41:44 - who
41:49 - I guess we just have to do it like this
41:52 - like so
42:20 - yeah
42:23 - thank sneaky so that we might get the
42:26 - day to work right now so let's test that
42:28 - so what we need to do is call this sore
42:31 - bye
42:32 - so let's see yes we're gonna let's
42:39 - manually call this and actually let's
42:49 - yeah let's go use this states sort by
43:00 - okay and then this way we'll be able to
43:06 - change values and state in in our dev
43:11 - tools
43:22 - so let's go was it a tortoise can you
43:30 - fetch the search term let's just put it
43:37 - after here for now what was that sort
43:43 - was this sort by was that what we called
43:45 - it
43:46 - yeah sort by okay let's try it
44:03 - alright so we say before in that part of
44:08 - that front let me just go up here
44:21 - alright only 53 awesome I'm not actually
44:29 - displaying the date you know it's :
44:36 - reacts
44:43 - okay so here's okay so nothing happened
44:48 - with our search type so that's no good
44:54 - because it should have this sort by date
44:56 - oldest should have taken type and it
44:59 - should have used it to set the state so
45:05 - that's no good
45:18 - and data
45:51 - hmmm let's change some things up to
46:05 - oh you're right sort by I didn't change
46:09 - there that's good all right so let's go
46:15 - with
46:25 - date
46:31 - all right let's change this up a little
46:32 - bit so we can really test it the way I'm
46:34 - doing it now is is a little silly okay
46:39 - let's take this out from now okay
46:48 - it's not except tight for now
46:59 - and let's display let's go down here to
47:06 - our display for components and name
47:23 - title rendered item type okay so right
47:28 - here let's put
47:41 - dates so now we'll actually be able to
47:46 - see the date in our results area so we
47:53 - can see the date here not very pretty
47:56 - but it works so right now
48:07 - [Music]
48:23 - and then see if
48:30 - all right so it looks like this is
48:32 - giving us newest first let's let's
48:38 - change this so we did say date oldest is
48:40 - a new list you're gonna switch anything
48:49 - no because we're not actually firing
48:52 - that off again all right let's change
49:02 - that
49:11 - are we getting
49:14 - [Music]
49:21 - alright let's actually put in our to our
49:23 - toggle here I think it'll make it a lot
49:26 - easier to test I'm just I'm checking the
49:34 - live chat here for a second
49:36 - to make sure I'm not missing anything
49:40 - okay alright so let's put in wonder what
49:49 - I did for that project that we were just
49:51 - looking at
49:52 - oh I remember I didn't have a drop down
49:56 - or anything I just had a list and you
49:58 - could just click on it okay
50:19 - all right let's see oopss know what I
50:21 - want I want material UI next there we go
50:33 - now I only have 8 minutes not sure I'm
50:37 - gonna be able to get to set in 8 minutes
50:41 - all right I'm not I'm not gonna be able
50:43 - to do that in 8 minutes we're gonna have
50:45 - to hard code some of this so that we can
50:47 - make sure that it works so let's go
50:51 - let's hard code dates actually this
50:56 - let's do and ok and then here we will
51:07 - put the type and we'll go date not like
51:11 - that
51:13 - date which I date newest
51:23 - okay so swear by his date newest and so
51:27 - now let's try biology and let's see 3 1
51:36 - 1 18-49 ok cool that does look like it's
51:43 - it's in it's showing the newest first
51:48 - now let's try oldest see if that makes a
51:57 - difference
52:06 - you know it didn't so we just changed
52:10 - this
52:17 - oops what happened yes sit stay
52:26 - oh you know what actually that shouldn't
52:29 - even matter because we're not we're not
52:32 - getting it from state anymore
52:33 - I was refresh
52:58 - yeah I'm definitely seeing no difference
53:01 - what am i doing
53:28 - well let's try this one
54:01 - food
54:08 - yeah my eyes are sorting not working
55:05 - go there so the second one and would be
55:09 - sorted let's see if there's any
55:13 - difference ID so we're 50 to 59 55 to 59
55:19 - 55
55:20 - yeah it looks like there's no difference
55:23 - in this sordid one
55:47 - okay so why is there no difference
55:52 - let's look up a sort make sure we're
55:55 - using that correctly so get an MD n this
56:03 - is a great resource so let's see how
56:07 - they're using sort so it looks like
56:11 - mansoura automatically sorts
56:23 - what's it automatically sorting into
56:29 - okay so it's up in a corner
56:31 - automatically
56:51 - okay and then you have our default okay
57:00 - all right so let's see if it was less
57:05 - than V I someone could he return
57:29 - yeah this is this is how we're using it
57:51 - now look at these examples
58:07 - [Music]
58:14 - [Music]
58:47 - maybe the problem is here let's do this
59:00 - sorted data
59:21 - yes
59:25 - I'm gonna change this to date oldest oh
59:32 - yeah alright last time I'm gonna test it
59:41 - before I go back to the live chat
59:44 - just give it a refresh just to be sure
59:50 - no but it's 53 52 59 55
60:23 - it's it's kind of weird
60:31 - all right let me check the live chat
60:35 - there are a few suggestions here okay
60:42 - michael says maybe try less than instead
60:46 - of - nikki says the return value for
60:49 - that sort function has to be a number it
60:54 - has three options that it takes into
60:55 - account negative zero positive okay all
61:02 - right so let's yeah I'm gonna end it now
61:09 - partly because I'm just I'm really
61:13 - feeling super tired so I'm I'm probably
61:16 - gonna leave work soon but basically at
61:20 - this point to get this working I would
61:25 - probably just do some testing to see
61:28 - whether or not what I have in here is
61:30 - actually even the right stuff so I might
61:35 - do like even just tests in the console I
61:39 - guess to see if these sorts work like
61:42 - individually I suppose yeah that would
61:50 - probably be my next step maybe read a
61:55 - little bit more of the documentation we
61:57 - were just reading I don't like to read a
61:59 - lot of documentation on the stream this
62:01 - I mean obviously it's not very fun to
62:03 - watch see okay I am gonna commit this
62:14 - even though it's not exactly working so
62:17 - let's just say did my internet just cut
62:20 - out
62:26 - okay if the stream just cut out I'm
62:29 - really sorry for that my internet just
62:30 - completely stopped for a few seconds and
62:33 - now it's back that's so that's the
62:36 - second time today the internet just
62:38 - completely cut out so I'm not sure
62:40 - what's going on but sorry about that
62:44 - alright let me now we've done to get ad
62:48 - let's do yarn CM and a new feature not
63:08 - the best can be message in the world but
63:10 - it'll do for now
63:12 - [Music]
63:17 - you know what I have my Ethernet cable
63:20 - unplugged from my computer because for
63:24 - some reason I can't access the database
63:26 - the old database with it plugged in so I
63:29 - was doing data transfer and I never
63:31 - plugged it back in so that's probably
63:34 - why the Internet's not as good as it
63:38 - normally is so I'll try to remember to
63:41 - have it plugged in for tomorrow stream
63:44 - okay so let me go back to the live chat
63:50 - now and answer some questions this is
63:51 - all but everything that I've done is now
63:59 - on the master branch on github so if you
64:03 - want to check it out please feel free to
64:05 - check that out if you want to submit
64:07 - pull requests that would be awesome
64:11 - let's see or if you want to use the code
64:13 - in any of your projects you know feel
64:16 - free to do so so I'm gonna find out
64:23 - where I left off here it is and for the
64:25 - rest of the stream we're not really
64:27 - going to do much coding unless I get a
64:30 - question about the code what I'm just
64:33 - going to go through do some questions
64:34 - and answers and let's see
64:44 - Leigha sue Kim says react is jazz
64:48 - framework yes it is a JavaScript
64:51 - framework
64:57 - Leah sue Kim says so many files any
65:00 - tutorial for learning file systems so
65:05 - that wish free code camp had a tutorial
65:07 - for that for newbies to think there
65:13 - there is a basic Linux tutorial in a
65:16 - basic get tutorial on Udacity and
65:19 - they're both free and they're both very
65:21 - short so it's easy to kind of go through
65:26 - the tutorials in just a few hours so I
65:31 - would recommend those so they're on you
65:33 - the Udacity website
65:41 - Oh Nicky says check out the beta free
65:44 - code camp curriculum it might have a
65:46 - tutorial yeah I don't know for sure if
65:48 - it does or not I haven't checked it out
65:49 - and a really really long time but there
65:53 - may be something in there that's a good
65:55 - thought we did have a question about the
66:02 - theme in my theme and I'm using Visual
66:06 - Studio code the theme is SETI SETI and
66:09 - then for github it's the github dark
66:12 - theme to probably have to google that
66:15 - and it's a little bit of work to get it
66:18 - working but it's not it's not really
66:24 - that difficult just a few steps John
66:29 - says needle in a haystack you've got a
66:31 - good memory Jesse even when you're fuzzy
66:33 - thank you thank God it just came to me
66:36 - all of a sudden I so it kind of lucked
66:39 - out there
66:49 - Leah sue Kim says big companies div tags
66:52 - are like sandwich inside each other it's
66:54 - hard to define which one is which yeah
66:57 - for sure for sure when the when the
66:59 - actual markup is created by like a
67:02 - program it there are quite a few divs in
67:06 - there also asked by the way what is he
67:10 - creating now it's a react website and in
67:16 - this particular thing that we're
67:17 - creating is a search page for that
67:20 - website so we're getting data from the
67:22 - WordPress REST API and we're pulling it
67:25 - into this react site and you know doing
67:28 - some sorting and filtering so that users
67:32 - can get exactly what they're looking for
67:38 - now Leah sue Kim s if free code camp has
67:44 - back-end course in PHP I don't think we
67:48 - have anything in PHP but again I really
67:51 - don't know what's there in the beta
67:52 - curriculum right now if I had to guess
67:55 - I'd say there's not PHP if you want
67:58 - something with PHP like a beginner
68:00 - course check out code Academy they do
68:04 - have some PHP courses I believe that
68:07 - some free courses in PHP so that that
68:09 - would be a good place to start for a
68:11 - beginner level if you're past the
68:13 - beginner level I don't I don't really
68:15 - know what's the best PHP resources
68:24 - let's see
68:31 - mahmud says semicolon stiff yeah I don't
68:34 - use semicolon but I'm okay if you want
68:40 - to use semicolons that's totally cool I
68:42 - don't hate on semicolon users Alexandre
68:49 - is saying anybody who's using MongoDB I
68:54 - wish to learn you know what we have
68:56 - [ __ ] going and some of our other
68:58 - projects and one of my side projects but
69:00 - I I didn't do a lot of hands-on work
69:04 - setting it up so I'm probably not the
69:08 - one to to teach anything about [ __ ] at
69:11 - this point I don't think Harsha is
69:15 - watching it's too late in his time zone
69:17 - but he knows about MongoDB so maybe in
69:22 - the future stream someone named Harshit
69:24 - might be in here Alexandre and he would
69:28 - he'd be able to tell you a lot more
69:29 - about [ __ ]
69:46 - because I'm having a lot of questions
69:48 - about editors and what tests editor are
69:50 - using if my test editor you mean like
69:54 - what I was testing with here this is
69:57 - just dev tools but it has the dark theme
70:01 - and then I was using the react dev tools
70:04 - which is a separate I think it's a
70:07 - plugin an extension that you can get so
70:12 - you know that doesn't automatically come
70:14 - with with Chrome and then you can just
70:19 - go into the settings and click on dark
70:21 - theme and it'll look like this
70:38 - dishes I wish I had a more powerful
70:40 - computer vs code and Chrome would work
70:43 - just fine then simultaneously oh yeah I
70:47 - guess I mean for my work computer it's
70:49 - it's pretty good so I never noticed that
70:52 - but yeah that probably could be an issue
70:55 - though on older computers I wonder I
71:02 - wonder is there another editor that
71:04 - takes less I don't I don't know I mean I
71:10 - would think Adam would be similar
71:12 - I don't really know about sublime
71:16 - whether Sublime's better or not
71:18 - Sublime's not electron based so maybe it
71:24 - would have better performance
71:31 - Jim trader says do you think it matters
71:33 - what platform someone learns to code on
71:35 - Windows versus Mac I was told that most
71:37 - employers provide Mac for their
71:39 - employees and that it would benefit me
71:41 - to learn on a Mac Jim trader I don't
71:47 - think yeah I don't think it would make a
71:52 - difference for me developing on Mac has
71:57 - been easier because most of the
71:58 - tutorials that I find assume that you
72:01 - have access to like the Linux commands
72:04 - so Mac or Linux would probably be
72:06 - preferable but when I was learning on
72:10 - Windows it was it was fun so I did I
72:14 - mean I've been a developer for five
72:17 - years maybe give or take a year and for
72:21 - the first few years I was always on
72:24 - Windows and then after that you know for
72:27 - like maybe six months I was sometimes
72:30 - windows sometimes Mac and then now for
72:32 - the last two years at least
72:33 - I've been predominantly like Mac all the
72:36 - time I don't do any development on
72:38 - Windows anymore yeah but I said the only
72:44 - difference that I've seen has just been
72:49 - the commands that I use
72:52 - so I I don't think as long as you know
72:55 - how to use a Mac it really doesn't take
72:57 - that long to get used to the differences
72:59 - so I wouldn't worry about that if anyone
73:03 - else has a different experience than
73:04 - that please let me know and let Jim
73:09 - Schrader note
73:21 - John says once you have the code inside
73:23 - your editor I don't believe that matters
73:25 - what your operating system is on your
73:27 - machine yes I mean that that's for sure
73:31 - I mean most of the which you do is going
73:33 - to be inside the editor and you can use
73:37 - the same editor on pretty much any
73:41 - machine you know if you're using like
73:43 - Adam or Visual Studio code so it should
73:46 - be fine no matter what you're using
73:52 - world's asked if I heard back from the
73:55 - Pittsburgh job interview
73:56 - yeah actually do you don't want an
73:59 - update on that I can give you an update
74:01 - on that now yeah why don't I just give
74:07 - you an update now so I had I don't know
74:15 - my Internet's cutting out again all
74:19 - right let me give it a second before I
74:20 - say anything all right it looks all
74:23 - right now
74:25 - so I had this interview a few weeks ago
74:28 - it went well and about a a week week and
74:34 - a half after the interview I got an
74:37 - offer from this company so the offer was
74:40 - pretty good it wasn't it wasn't quite as
74:43 - much as I was expecting so I did a
74:52 - little bit of you know talked with the
74:54 - company let him know more of like what
74:56 - what my salary expectations were and you
75:00 - know like what I was basically like what
75:02 - I was dealing with and why I expected a
75:05 - higher salary you know just in terms of
75:07 - you know my family my expenses and
75:10 - things so they they were I'm still
75:18 - waiting on some information so tomorrow
75:21 - I should get more info back on exactly
75:23 - what they can do in terms of
75:26 - compensation to give me more than their
75:29 - initial offer so I have not
75:33 - made my final decision yet as to whether
75:35 - I do want to work at this other place
75:37 - it's it's going to depend on what
75:40 - information I get tomorrow so basically
75:45 - I have my numbers in mind of what it
75:48 - would take for me to leave where I'm at
75:50 - right now so if those numbers get met I
75:53 - probably will leave otherwise I'll stay
75:57 - I've already talked it over with my
75:59 - family and so yeah at this point it's
76:03 - just you know does it make financial
76:06 - sense to move to go somewhere else or
76:09 - not so we'll find out you know hopefully
76:12 - tomorrow I will get the the info so they
76:17 - said it would be tomorrow so I'm that's
76:21 - what I'm gonna be able to make my final
76:22 - decision but after the whole process is
76:26 - over maybe I can make a little video and
76:28 - explaining more what happened I just I
76:30 - don't want to comment on it too much
76:32 - while it's happening I think I'll have a
76:37 - much better perspective on the whole
76:38 - process once it's all done with and I'll
76:41 - be able to give I don't like a much
76:44 - better explanation of the the whole
76:46 - thing
77:10 - let's see
77:19 - all right Julio says you can use
77:26 - built-in get instead of the terminal way
77:28 - I I guess you mean like they get stuff
77:34 - built into Visual Studio code I've never
77:37 - tried to use any of the stuff built into
77:39 - Visual Studio code to be honest with you
77:40 - I I just I mean when I learned get
77:43 - initially I just learned all the command
77:45 - line stuff and so I don't I really know
77:48 - how to use the other stuff
77:59 - I sing videos says what is the WordPress
78:07 - REST API exactly okay so the WordPress
78:10 - REST API is so you have your regular
78:13 - WordPress installation so any of the
78:15 - ones that are using the latest versions
78:17 - of WordPress they're really any version
78:19 - for I think at least the last year we'll
78:22 - have the REST API built in so what you
78:24 - can do is send a query to the REST API
78:29 - and they'll give you data back in JSON
78:31 - format right so it's just it works like
78:34 - any REST API so you can get all you get
78:37 - a bunch of data from from WordPress so
78:39 - by default you can't get everything but
78:42 - with the right plugins or you know
78:44 - custom PHP you can pretty much get all
78:47 - the data you want from WordPress so it
78:51 - allows you to use WordPress as a content
78:52 - management system without using the
78:54 - display part of WordPress so WordPress
78:57 - themes and and all that you can just get
79:00 - the data out and use it wherever you
79:01 - want on on other web sites that aren't
79:03 - wordpress based let me know if that
79:06 - explanation cleared things up for you I
79:09 - can go kind of in more depth or show
79:10 - some examples of the data if you need me
79:12 - to the candy gamer extreme asks in your
79:19 - opinion is it too late to start coding
79:20 - after you join your uni or is it still
79:23 - possible to make a good career oh yeah
79:28 - it's never too late to start coding no
79:31 - yeah I didn't start coding until after I
79:34 - was done with uni and my wife's learning
79:40 - to code right now and she's she didn't
79:46 - start learning to code until she's 32
79:48 - so yeah never too late to start learning
79:54 - to code bark char so has just dropped in
79:58 - how often do you stream I try to stream
80:00 - Monday through Friday every day I don't
80:04 - always get there but that's that's the
80:06 - goal but for sure I usually stream you
80:09 - know a few times a week at at least
80:17 - Aniki says if you're really into editor
80:19 - performance I guess them would take the
80:21 - cake I didn't even think about them but
80:23 - yeah I suppose them would probably be
80:25 - the most performant one them was last
80:30 - time I tried them I was I was a little
80:32 - lost so I haven't tried it since then
80:37 - I'd like to try it again at some point
80:39 - I hear if you really do learn them it's
80:43 - it's good for productivity so I would
80:47 - I'd really need to take the time to get
80:49 - to learn it first so maybe someday I
80:52 - will
81:09 - okay I'm under the bottom alright I
81:12 - think up to the bottom there were a few
81:13 - comments and things that I kind of
81:14 - skipped over a bit mainly because there
81:17 - are conversations back and forth me too
81:19 - and other people in the chat but now
81:21 - that you all who are watching this
81:25 - recording can view the live chat as well
81:28 - I'll probably not read off everything
81:32 - like I did before that should help keep
81:34 - the streams just a little bit shorter
81:37 - maybe a little bit easier to follow
81:38 - along with oh we did get one more
81:41 - question corrington says hi Jesse what's
81:48 - the font you're using in your text
81:50 - editor I don't know let's find out where
81:55 - we had settings/preferences
82:03 - maybe settings yeah let's get rid of
82:08 - this alright the font family is Menlo so
82:15 - I'm assuming it's Menlo so there we are
82:26 - does anyone have a font that they really
82:29 - think is better for for coding
82:33 - I'm opening I mean I know that's gonna
82:36 - have a huge difference in readability
82:37 - and things so I'm definitely open to
82:40 - changing changing things up yeah no
82:44 - problem course and then let me know if
82:49 - I'm mispronouncing the name that name I
82:51 - want to get it right if I can all right
82:57 - so I see icing video says thank you for
83:01 - that answer about WordPress api's would
83:03 - you be able to use any API available at
83:06 - Google etc thanks for helpful oh yeah
83:08 - for sure you can use any API you want
83:12 - from from reacts or from a lot of other
83:16 - things for that matter but yeah we could
83:17 - pull in from wherever we need to get the
83:21 - data from and the process would be
83:24 - somewhat similar right you know all API
83:27 - is have their differences in how you're
83:29 - supposed to use them but you know it
83:31 - basically making the calls fetching the
83:34 - data getting back JSON format and then
83:37 - filtering and sorting that and
83:39 - displaying it on the page that that's
83:42 - going to be the same no matter where
83:45 - you're getting the data from
83:56 - okay so fire a code with ligatures all
84:02 - right is that is that a font is that a
84:07 - font that's like well-known enough that
84:10 - I could just use it let's see where did
84:17 - it take my stuff copy the settings there
84:21 - we are
84:23 - so can I do
84:40 - so would it work like that is that the
84:43 - name can I get it to work or what I have
84:44 - to like bring it in somehow need to
84:50 - download it okay so maybe I need to
84:52 - download that what was the other one
84:54 - console us so John says try consoles I'm
84:58 - gonna leave that there in case I
85:00 - download it then it might it might work
85:02 - so let's leave that there is the first
85:03 - one and then we'll do ok cool for this
85:14 - one let's check it out huh oh I like
85:20 - that I might try this out for a little
85:23 - while then
85:32 - no-no-no that changes things okay so I
85:39 - can get I can get fire code on github
85:44 - okay cool I'll have to try that out
85:53 - maybe let's just check it out right now
85:55 - this this will probably the last thing
85:57 - we do on the stream but if I don't do it
86:00 - right now I'll probably forget cuz I
86:02 - don't feel a lot I'm probably gonna go
86:04 - home right after this maybe I can get it
86:11 - on vs code right away cool alright oh
86:18 - cool sure
86:33 - see
86:35 - cool alright so let's try it I need to
86:42 - let's go back here but I still I'm open
86:46 - huh yeah all right so let's change it up
86:49 - to fire code and I need I need to add
86:57 - these so those it's all together and
87:00 - then what was that ligatures they're
87:04 - gonna let me just change this editor
87:12 - font like it sure is true
87:37 - okay so yeah it doesn't look like it
87:40 - works what am I missing
87:42 - does work you can try restarting it or
87:45 - wrapping it let's make sure I wrap that
87:49 - properly yeah the kitchen I restarting
87:56 - maybe I can try that then yeah let's
87:59 - restart yeah I got an update coming
88:04 - anyway so I was well retry okay
88:12 - nikki says the ligatures make things
88:14 - like like the arrow function look like
88:17 - an actual arrow that's cool very cool
88:24 - okay nikki says check out the
88:26 - installation instructions so let's see
88:34 - now that i happily get yours on alright
88:37 - so not yet alright let me go back to the
88:39 - installation instructions then cool
88:56 - I will download this first I don't
89:02 - install on a Mac
89:11 - oh I can just do home bro let's do that
89:17 - yeah let's just run home bro all right
89:21 - cool
89:25 - now that's not supported all right fine
89:29 - I'll just do it this way just like the
89:31 - old phone calls right-click and select
89:33 - open go select install font okay cool
90:03 - what just happened no this is not what I
90:07 - wanted to happen
90:08 - all right there's instructions all files
90:14 - right click open select install flaunt
90:17 - that is not what just happened when I
90:19 - followed this instructions I think like
90:28 - this is not how I normally install fonts
90:49 - alright let's open a new Finder window
90:54 - alright I got my stuff my windows open
90:56 - on another page so that's why I'm not
90:59 - seeing that much happening so all right
91:01 - so on a Mac download it right there's
91:06 - another way for sure to do this right
91:13 - isn't there a fonts folder
92:20 - all right insult etfs then it is going
92:24 - to work okay cool that's what I just did
92:26 - I'll tell you my angel t-shirt all right
92:28 - cool so I took the TTF file so I'll put
92:31 - them in the font folder so let's see
92:33 - what happened wait is this it is this
92:37 - working huh yay cool all right so just
92:45 - just to show you all what I needed to do
92:48 - when I do my other screen so am i Mac I
92:52 - have like under my username I went into
92:57 - library which is a hidden folder and
92:59 - then the fonts' and then I just drove
93:02 - over so I downloaded
93:05 - there were several files that came up so
93:07 - one of them was the TTF file so I just
93:10 - grabbed everything that's in the TTF
93:11 - file and then I drug it over to here and
93:16 - then it just started working so you can
93:18 - see I've done this before with fonts
93:19 - which didn't remember I did it
93:20 - so all the Roboto stuff that I have in
93:23 - here materiai cons and things like that
93:25 - are in here already
93:30 - alright cool that that looks really cool
93:38 - Wow yeah a lot of stuff looks yeah you
93:41 - can definitely tell the difference
93:45 - awesome
93:52 - very cool all right
93:59 - all right well I think that's it for the
94:07 - stream so I hope that I don't get even
94:11 - more sick than I am right now and that I
94:14 - will come to work tomorrow and be able
94:16 - to strain if I can't strain tomorrow
94:19 - then you probably know where I'm at I'm
94:22 - home in bed
94:25 - but I will most likely be able to stream
94:30 - at my big normal time tomorrow I don't
94:32 - think I have a lot going on so I'll
94:34 - probably be around noon sometime thank
94:36 - you all so much for watching and for
94:38 - helping out for all your advice and for
94:41 - helping each other out in the live chat
94:42 - it was some great questions and answers
94:44 - today and yeah so see y'all tomorrow and
94:52 - until then have a wonderful day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone welcome to live coding with Jessie I'm Jessie and today we're going to keep working on that search page that we've been working on for a while now but we're gonna move on to something new we're gonna work on the sorting which we just started to get into at the end of yesterday stream so now I'd like to spend a little bit of time and try to actually get it working I'm going to start out let's see I'll just check in analytics make sure we had some people in here before I start out and give my my usual opening statement I think the analytics is a little bit behind this I know we have more people waiting but for those of you who are new we in this sorry so if you're new in this stream you get to watch me do my daily work as a frontend developer for a small university I don't rehearse this beforehand so there will be mistakes and that's kind of the point is that you get to see a fulltime developer make mistakes and work through those mistakes my hope is that if you're new to web development or to programming in general you'll see that it's okay to make mistakes you know everybody makes mistakes at least I do a lot and you know you just work through and you keep going and we also have some very experienced developers that watch as well and they can provide some useful help in the live chat so if you can watch it live and ask questions in the chat you'll get some good answers you know most of the time we break everything up by Pomodoro sessions so Pomodoro session is 25 minutes so we'll do 25 minutes of code we'll take a fiveminute break and we'll chat in the live chat a bit and then 25 minutes of code and then at the end of the show that's when we do most of the question and answers so if you ask a question please be patient and we'll get to it at the end of the show the show is available to watch as a recording you know right after the stream so you know at any point in the future if you want to come back to it or you can't catch the whole thing now you know don't worry about it you can just watch later on whenever you have a chance okay cool so it looks like we have our normal number of viewers in here now so I'm gonna switch screens so y'all can see what I see we will be working in our search j/s file if you check the description for this video there will be a link to the github repo and the github repo is up to date let's double check and make sure we'll do a get pool right everything's up to date here I always like to start out my work by doing a git pull to make sure there aren't any changes that haven't you know made their way down locally yet it's a pain to start working and then realize that you don't have all the code I'm also going to bring the Pomodoro timer over here and we're going to start it and I'm gonna start the end rock server as well and then that way you all can see what I'm seeing on my screen and you can click around and test the site on your own so here's the end Rock link coming into the live chat right now and alright John Hanson and the chap mentioned that the chat is saved yeah second I saw at least yesterday's video had the chat saved so if you watch the replay you will be able to see what's going on the chat I think that's really nice I mean I've tried my best to try to read out things in the chat but I know I missed something sometimes so now you'll be able to keep up with everything that's going on the chat it for those of you who can't watch live I think that will really help you to be able to understand you know kind of the backandforth between you those of you in the in the live chat now okay rut Rajesh I see your question we'll get to that on the first break okay so if you could just hang on for a little bit at the end of this twenty five minutes I'll get to that question if anyone the live chat wants to address the question of how to start out learning to code and react you know please put the answers in there now for Ruud Rajesh or Rajesh I'm sorry I'm not sure how to pronounce that okay then Nicky says there was a pull request for the search page so let's check that out Melvin so the first part may just be taking care of this pull request okay let's see the notifications okay let's check that out so if you're not familiar with how to manage projects through github this will be kind of a good you know good little intro to merging pull requests so we get a pull request in and whatever usually you have a description if somebody submits pull requests in the description then not it's probably not likely to get merged so updated State in an immutable way in the only change handler for checkboxes only called creates search sites after set state is complete okay cool so Niki I'm not gonna read these right now on the chat I don't I don't know why I didn't see this PR you know now I remember when the notification came up for this and I was at a meeting this morning for a few hours so that's probably why I didn't remember it after the meeting ended so let's now that we read what it's about I always go in and check the files to see what changed exactly so on the left hand side this is what was there before the right hand side are the changes so here's our handle change function before and now before we were reading the variable for checkboxes sorry I'm not feeling well so if I'm coughing or sneezing I apologize in advance so let's see just a teeth on search alright so now I'm not as worried about explaining what we did cuz we did this on a stream so let's go okay so we're getting the previous state so when you go to do set state you you can have get the previous state here you don't usually need it but it does come in handy sometimes and now we're returning checkboxes previous state check boxes okay Nikki that's a great idea now I remember you saying that in the live chat and for whatever reason I didn't implement it then but just to explain what's going on here so we're returning check boxes so we're gonna set the state of check boxes and the new state of check boxes is going to be everything from the old State combined with one of the check boxes being checked so whatever one we just clicked on will be checked okay so you see these three dots in front of here so this is already all the check boxes here and we're just combining it so it's a way to combine in this case what do we have an object yeah it's a combined objects really easily in a concise way what is that the spread operator is that what that's called it's an es6 thing so I believe it's spread operator let me know in the live chat if that's the wrong name for it but if you look up ESX spread operator then you should be able to find a lot more info on on how to use this and when it's appropriate to use it all right and then after that we're gonna create the search types and if you're not sure what that's doing it's it's okay it's just calling off a function and then this function is actually going to run the search so if you check out the stream yesterday you can learn a lot more about what these functions are doing but for now just know that once the checkbox is checked the last thing that's going to happen is it's actually going to search okay so I am getting confirmation that it was the spread operator so that is the right word for it so it's it's really really useful so if you find yourself needing to do things with with objects with combining objects and things check it out alright wonderful you know that Niki this looks great I'm not I'm not even gonna test this out first I'm just going to merge it because it's really evident what this does and I think we're safe to just merge it you don't always want to just merge something if it's a small change like this and really you know kind of welldone and obvious to see what's happening I'm usually okay with just merging it but anything really bigger than this you'll want to test first and I do have some videos where I've tested things so if you go if you go back and search through my videos and find one on like merging pool requests that'll I think I go through the whole process of testing I'd like to make a video on on my own channel which there's a link in description for my own channel so I'd like to make a short to the point video on merging for people that don't want to sift through all the hours of live streams and they just wanted me to get to the point I'm gonna make a video for those for those people in for people who just don't have time to watch the stream so I think I'm gonna make that somewhat soon still watch out for that I'll tell you all when I when I do make it if you're interested so now since I I've decided I do want to merge this all I have to do is go here and go to merge pull request nice I'm going to confirm the merge now you can do you thinks through the command line but this is in my opinion the fastest way to do it if you know you want to merge it right away I always leave a comment I always want to show my appreciation for those of you that do submit pull requests and if you're maintaining a repository and github I also recommend that you show your appreciation and encouragement for those who who do submit pull requests I know for me like especially when I was starting out it could be very very intimidating to submit pull requests and you know kind of being ignored or having some harsh words can really did demoralize you so just be aware of that you know when you're a maintainer new people especially like really look up to you and if they care enough about your project to want to you know submit a pull request they may have put a lot of time into it even if it doesn't seem like it because if they're beginner it may taken a long time for them to do even something basic so you know a word of encouragement from you could really you know kind of give them that motivation to increase their skills but you know a mean word could kind of crush their spirit you know they may be the last straw for them so you know I'm not saying that you're entirely responsible for their their whole career but you know just be aware of that for me on both sides of it that's just you know kind of what I've seen ok we need to now pull those changes down oops let me make this bigger I'm sorry about that that was so small before all right so we're gonna do a get pool again and those changes that we just merged in on github are now local in our search that jazz file so let's scroll down just to see handle change what's going on it's not showing me it don't say let me just open it up again there we are sometimes it doesn't automatically change for me so I have to reopen the file but now you can see that here's all the changes and definitely want to verify that everything still works I mean based on what we saw in the code it should still work but it's good to get to try it out so let's go with good to know we have a theology major wonderful let's make sure that you know we have Department there's nobody with four faculty there we go okay it was working wonderful okay great so these are working now and alright here's the next step then let's now we have a check boxes you know working we definitely want to add more check boxes but for now we're just kind of getting everything working and then we can fill in you know however many check boxes or sorting things that we need later on we still don't have all the data over so I don't really know how many check boxes we need until I get all that data over so now I'd like to go back to where we left off at yesterday with our sorting I believe where did we put this sorting they we are so we have this function here it's a sort by type and let's just briefly review what we've done so for those of you that watched yesterday you know just bear with me as I repeat this because I'm sure there are people that that didn't see it so we're gonna call this sort by function whenever a user clicks on I guess it'll be will be a dropdown or radio I haven't I don't know exactly what kind of input we'll do either a radio or a dropdown so I guess so let's just think about that for the next few minutes as I'm going over this and let me know what you think would be better for this type of thing so first we're gonna do a check to see if the data that we've gotten is equal to 100 so what we're getting data from wordpress from the wordpress api they the max amount of posts that we can get from the wordpress api is 100 so we know if we've gotten 100 posts and we want to do a sort we need to actually do another search and do the sorting in WordPress and then get the sorted data you know because if our search would normally return 500 posts and we only have a hundred right now we haven't gotten the rest of them and then we sort those hundred then when it's not going to give the result that the user really expects or needs right if it's alphabetical you know and we're starting with a there's going to be a lot of other stuff that starts with a that is in that you know other 400 posts that we haven't even gotten yet so the sorting is going to be messed up and we need all right Nikki what's the end grog link all right I posted it once let's post it again sorry about that Nikki so that's why we have that check so that may or may not make sense I think I did a better job of explaining it yesterday because we were actually getting the data and things but basically we need that check to make sure that we we do end up returning the correct data to the user the other check we're going to make is if the data equals zero if the data equals zero then this probably means that a search has not occurred yet so it's very I don't even know if it's possible the search would not have occurred yet and the user is actually clicking these sorting things and there's actually something in the the search bar but I threw that in there just in case we may be able to remove this if as we build this out we realized that this is an impossible scenario we'll remove it but better safe than sorry on that it's just a little extra thing so in any case we just do another we do another search so first we set the state sort by to our type so this is the type of sorting that we're passing in and then we do this this search so we haven't added in like are sorting right so we need to do that today else so if the data if the number of posts we have in instate is greater than 1 greater than 0 but less than 100 then we come down here and we just do a sort on the data we already have and we don't make another API call which will definitely save resources it'll save time it'll save the users bandwidth ok so this is a data sorted okay and then we just changed the order of the data then state and since this is react we change state everything gets rearended so the user will immediately see all that data that they were seeing before but now it's going to be sorted the way they want it so let's let's build out this sorting function and I think we had did we find an example at the end of the stream I can't remember I don't think I pasted one the copy and paste one I mainly remember trying to find an example then I apologize again like my mind is just fuzzy I'm definitely starting to get sick so I'm gonna do my best in this stream but I know I'm gonna mess some things up what is this resources oh okay now I remember we searched in here I thought that I had some sorting happening in here but then after searching through this I realized that I didn't have sorting did we have sorting what project did we have it in all right let me check one other project if it's not in this other one then we'll come up with it on our own but we could potentially save us a lot of time if we can just use something we've used before bulletin I think the bulletin react project possibly has it let's see who not there okay all right so we're doing some searching here okay cool so we're doing a filter by dates but I don't think we're doing this clientside this project is still unfinished okay so let's let's just go over here then and I'm trying to think of so we're gonna have four different types of sorting you know what I remember where I've done this before I'm pretty sure that I've done this this exact type of sorting before I just can't remember if I did a clientside or serverside so let me find it okay let's see where they did in reducers give a set sorting alright shouldn't out sort by okay maybe I did the sorting in the component then so this is a project that's using react and redux so if you're not familiar with redux then some of this will probably look really weird all these projects that I've been searching through are completely opensource they're available on my github repo or my github profile so you can check them out if you want to know more about it this was one that I did for the Udacity react nanodegree this was project two so let's see the views let's see if I have this and you sold my bringing in the sorting sort great okay side nav sort by I know of another one yes yes all right cool all right so I found it yeah Wow I knew I had done this before with react so we're not using Redux in our current project so the way we implement this will be slightly different so instead of getting values from redux we're gonna get our values directly from state it should be fine the search page is just one page I'm okay with just using state instead of using Redux we may find down the line that we have a lot more going on and maybe we should use Redux we can always switch over that at that time or something like Redux you know something you know builtin with Apollo so we're doing we are doing some filtering here that we don't need to do and our project but here's the actual sort so we have a switch statement and this allows us to sort for multiple different types of sorting all which is one dot sort I think this is what we'll go with this is a lot cleaner than having lots of different functions to sort you know we just can have one so the switch statement takes in this prop sort by which in our case will be this state sort by well even use the same subconsciously I think I remember this because I even use the same name for it but in the case by score lowest we have dates so that date will actually be one so we can do date oldest so in this case we're returning aid timestamp minus B dot timestamp okay and that will that'll sort this by the oldest date so the oldest date is going to be the like less than right so dates being like just a big long number okay so that's the default here so we're gonna have to return a default we'll figure out what the default ought to be what the user will expect I'm thinking newest first might be what what's expected so we'll have to maybe we'll have to think about that and then replace what needs replaced and then we'll try out our sorting okay let's see okay so right reg s okay well we had a question before that Wow there were some of you were here a half hour early so Divya says already waiting last night you left at some place to explain please explain that again okay let me know Divya what I was explaining so I did go back and explain some of what we were doing yesterday but I may not have explained exactly what you needed so please let me know and I'll try to explain and then Rajesh says I'm new to react can you suggest me a way to start coding and react I'm sure you've probably gotten some other answers down lower in the livechat so sorry if I'm repeating but the react documentation is a nice place to start the if you want to pay for a course the Udacity react nano degree I took that course myself I learned a lot from it so I think that's a good one to do I think who is it west west boss I have never done any of his courses with w es BOS okay so look that up he does a lot of courses like I said I haven't done any so I can't say from personal experience but a lot of people really like his courses I'm gonna have to try stuff out one day you know just because I've heard so many good things about it those resources should be pretty decent to get you started I'm sure there's a lot of other good resources out there I just haven't seen them yet see a lot a lot of you were saying hi so hey Amit says write some code that was at the beginning when I was going over my intro so I haven't actually written that much code yet so we're gonna get to some code sometimes that's how it is though programming is a lot of thinking and looking things up and reviewing code you know what I actually typed that much some days we type a lot some days we don't let's see more of you saying hi I'm not gonna go through every one individually but I do see all of your names so hello everyone the the garv man I'm messing up his name bar Bhargav bah aaargh av really sorry I'm sure messing up your name let me know I should pronounce it says why don't you try at Google my bro I'm not exactly sure you mean like try to work at Google I did apply to a job at Google in Pittsburgh a while ago so that would be cool but I'm sure a lot of really really good developers apply it to any jobs at Google so that'd be a long shot for me okay so Ahmad also recommends West bus so the courses react for beginners so thank you for that Ahmad all right so divya says start with react tutorials from net ninja and learn Codecademy oh you know what i forgot about learning code academy that's a youtube channel I did learn a lot about react from that YouTube channel and about get and a lot of other things the channels not updated regularly anymore so some of what you see in those videos will be a little outdated but it's it's like fundamentally still pretty good so so yeah definitely check out that that channel 10 says reduce mic volume is my mic is it too loud I mean I'd hate to I mean for all I said if it's too loud then maybe just turn down the video cuz I don't want to turn it down and then mess it up for everybody else so let me know I mean if everybody's saying it's too loud then maybe I'll turn it down but I'd rather have it too loud for some and then give them the ability to turn it down on their own machines because if it's too low for people you can't you know they can't do anything about that okay so it didn't make it through everything in the live chat I will come back and finish up with all the questions in the live chat after after we finish up with this Pomodoro session so now let's grab this sort let's see we need this too Wow am I actually doing the map as well yeah I am well okay all right so where we get our swords let's put it here okay so this state data sword okay so we're sorting that we're saving it to the variable sort of data and instead of this props we want this state sort by and actually we do we need this states whereby no we don't we don't need to grab it here because we already we're pulling in the type so let's just get the type it'll save us a few characters so we can probably refactor this a good bit after we get finished with it but let's just get it working first so our cases here are gonna be different I don't want to go with these all caps I mean that's that was the way to do it with with Redux but I don't want it hopes what did I do I don't want to do it like that here so this is vote score so we don't want those four we want give an alphabetical order so actually let's just change our let's make sure we're actually getting a timestamp with this data or what it is yeah we are getting we're getting all of the data back right okay let me look here we are okay so here's the data that we're getting in the format all right so here's the date let's make sure that there aren't any other dates that would be more appropriate to use okay so here's the day should we change the date then probably we're probably going to need to manipulate this date first but at least we know we can we can get that date and then title is what we use for the alphabetical order stuff so title rendered okay this is gonna be a dots everywhere instead of timestamp we're just gonna say date for now well we're probably gonna have to change this but we'll just save it there for now we may need to yeah I'm not gonna get ahead of myself let's just keep going here so we don't have a vote score but we won't need to make this let's go with I don't rendered and then let's just put these in so I remember what it is so instead of us who are lowest this will be alpha that's ending and this is gonna be alpha descending is our default I don't want that to be our default that will change it but not right now date by oldest just call this dates newest date all the stateless okay and this is the type this should be outside the ifstatement okay because no matter what we need to change the sort that's we're tight okay actually all right I got some other ideas for how this can be refactored buzz I need to focus and not keep getting ahead of myself let's see it's for now I just want to return is this this is gonna save to data right this sort data and then it's gonna set State okay so we should be able to just check this as long as we check data to see if it's doing anything I want to check and see if any of these will work as is I don't have high hopes that they will oh let's say Nikki in the live chat has something for I so day two UNIX epoch due date for ashore I sewed a string oh cool awesome so let's let's do that now so within who I guess we just have to do it like this like so yeah thank sneaky so that we might get the day to work right now so let's test that so what we need to do is call this sore bye so let's see yes we're gonna let's manually call this and actually let's yeah let's go use this states sort by okay and then this way we'll be able to change values and state in in our dev tools so let's go was it a tortoise can you fetch the search term let's just put it after here for now what was that sort was this sort by was that what we called it yeah sort by okay let's try it alright so we say before in that part of that front let me just go up here alright only 53 awesome I'm not actually displaying the date you know it's reacts okay so here's okay so nothing happened with our search type so that's no good because it should have this sort by date oldest should have taken type and it should have used it to set the state so that's no good and data hmmm let's change some things up to oh you're right sort by I didn't change there that's good all right so let's go with date all right let's change this up a little bit so we can really test it the way I'm doing it now is is a little silly okay let's take this out from now okay it's not except tight for now and let's display let's go down here to our display for components and name title rendered item type okay so right here let's put dates so now we'll actually be able to see the date in our results area so we can see the date here not very pretty but it works so right now and then see if all right so it looks like this is giving us newest first let's let's change this so we did say date oldest is a new list you're gonna switch anything no because we're not actually firing that off again all right let's change that are we getting alright let's actually put in our to our toggle here I think it'll make it a lot easier to test I'm just I'm checking the live chat here for a second to make sure I'm not missing anything okay alright so let's put in wonder what I did for that project that we were just looking at oh I remember I didn't have a drop down or anything I just had a list and you could just click on it okay all right let's see oopss know what I want I want material UI next there we go now I only have 8 minutes not sure I'm gonna be able to get to set in 8 minutes all right I'm not I'm not gonna be able to do that in 8 minutes we're gonna have to hard code some of this so that we can make sure that it works so let's go let's hard code dates actually this let's do and ok and then here we will put the type and we'll go date not like that date which I date newest okay so swear by his date newest and so now let's try biology and let's see 3 1 1 1849 ok cool that does look like it's it's in it's showing the newest first now let's try oldest see if that makes a difference you know it didn't so we just changed this oops what happened yes sit stay oh you know what actually that shouldn't even matter because we're not we're not getting it from state anymore I was refresh yeah I'm definitely seeing no difference what am i doing well let's try this one food yeah my eyes are sorting not working go there so the second one and would be sorted let's see if there's any difference ID so we're 50 to 59 55 to 59 55 yeah it looks like there's no difference in this sordid one okay so why is there no difference let's look up a sort make sure we're using that correctly so get an MD n this is a great resource so let's see how they're using sort so it looks like mansoura automatically sorts what's it automatically sorting into okay so it's up in a corner automatically okay and then you have our default okay all right so let's see if it was less than V I someone could he return yeah this is this is how we're using it now look at these examples maybe the problem is here let's do this sorted data yes I'm gonna change this to date oldest oh yeah alright last time I'm gonna test it before I go back to the live chat just give it a refresh just to be sure no but it's 53 52 59 55 it's it's kind of weird all right let me check the live chat there are a few suggestions here okay michael says maybe try less than instead of nikki says the return value for that sort function has to be a number it has three options that it takes into account negative zero positive okay all right so let's yeah I'm gonna end it now partly because I'm just I'm really feeling super tired so I'm I'm probably gonna leave work soon but basically at this point to get this working I would probably just do some testing to see whether or not what I have in here is actually even the right stuff so I might do like even just tests in the console I guess to see if these sorts work like individually I suppose yeah that would probably be my next step maybe read a little bit more of the documentation we were just reading I don't like to read a lot of documentation on the stream this I mean obviously it's not very fun to watch see okay I am gonna commit this even though it's not exactly working so let's just say did my internet just cut out okay if the stream just cut out I'm really sorry for that my internet just completely stopped for a few seconds and now it's back that's so that's the second time today the internet just completely cut out so I'm not sure what's going on but sorry about that alright let me now we've done to get ad let's do yarn CM and a new feature not the best can be message in the world but it'll do for now you know what I have my Ethernet cable unplugged from my computer because for some reason I can't access the database the old database with it plugged in so I was doing data transfer and I never plugged it back in so that's probably why the Internet's not as good as it normally is so I'll try to remember to have it plugged in for tomorrow stream okay so let me go back to the live chat now and answer some questions this is all but everything that I've done is now on the master branch on github so if you want to check it out please feel free to check that out if you want to submit pull requests that would be awesome let's see or if you want to use the code in any of your projects you know feel free to do so so I'm gonna find out where I left off here it is and for the rest of the stream we're not really going to do much coding unless I get a question about the code what I'm just going to go through do some questions and answers and let's see Leigha sue Kim says react is jazz framework yes it is a JavaScript framework Leah sue Kim says so many files any tutorial for learning file systems so that wish free code camp had a tutorial for that for newbies to think there there is a basic Linux tutorial in a basic get tutorial on Udacity and they're both free and they're both very short so it's easy to kind of go through the tutorials in just a few hours so I would recommend those so they're on you the Udacity website Oh Nicky says check out the beta free code camp curriculum it might have a tutorial yeah I don't know for sure if it does or not I haven't checked it out and a really really long time but there may be something in there that's a good thought we did have a question about the theme in my theme and I'm using Visual Studio code the theme is SETI SETI and then for github it's the github dark theme to probably have to google that and it's a little bit of work to get it working but it's not it's not really that difficult just a few steps John says needle in a haystack you've got a good memory Jesse even when you're fuzzy thank you thank God it just came to me all of a sudden I so it kind of lucked out there Leah sue Kim says big companies div tags are like sandwich inside each other it's hard to define which one is which yeah for sure for sure when the when the actual markup is created by like a program it there are quite a few divs in there also asked by the way what is he creating now it's a react website and in this particular thing that we're creating is a search page for that website so we're getting data from the WordPress REST API and we're pulling it into this react site and you know doing some sorting and filtering so that users can get exactly what they're looking for now Leah sue Kim s if free code camp has backend course in PHP I don't think we have anything in PHP but again I really don't know what's there in the beta curriculum right now if I had to guess I'd say there's not PHP if you want something with PHP like a beginner course check out code Academy they do have some PHP courses I believe that some free courses in PHP so that that would be a good place to start for a beginner level if you're past the beginner level I don't I don't really know what's the best PHP resources let's see mahmud says semicolon stiff yeah I don't use semicolon but I'm okay if you want to use semicolons that's totally cool I don't hate on semicolon users Alexandre is saying anybody who's using MongoDB I wish to learn you know what we have [ __ ] going and some of our other projects and one of my side projects but I I didn't do a lot of handson work setting it up so I'm probably not the one to to teach anything about [ __ ] at this point I don't think Harsha is watching it's too late in his time zone but he knows about MongoDB so maybe in the future stream someone named Harshit might be in here Alexandre and he would he'd be able to tell you a lot more about [ __ ] because I'm having a lot of questions about editors and what tests editor are using if my test editor you mean like what I was testing with here this is just dev tools but it has the dark theme and then I was using the react dev tools which is a separate I think it's a plugin an extension that you can get so you know that doesn't automatically come with with Chrome and then you can just go into the settings and click on dark theme and it'll look like this dishes I wish I had a more powerful computer vs code and Chrome would work just fine then simultaneously oh yeah I guess I mean for my work computer it's it's pretty good so I never noticed that but yeah that probably could be an issue though on older computers I wonder I wonder is there another editor that takes less I don't I don't know I mean I would think Adam would be similar I don't really know about sublime whether Sublime's better or not Sublime's not electron based so maybe it would have better performance Jim trader says do you think it matters what platform someone learns to code on Windows versus Mac I was told that most employers provide Mac for their employees and that it would benefit me to learn on a Mac Jim trader I don't think yeah I don't think it would make a difference for me developing on Mac has been easier because most of the tutorials that I find assume that you have access to like the Linux commands so Mac or Linux would probably be preferable but when I was learning on Windows it was it was fun so I did I mean I've been a developer for five years maybe give or take a year and for the first few years I was always on Windows and then after that you know for like maybe six months I was sometimes windows sometimes Mac and then now for the last two years at least I've been predominantly like Mac all the time I don't do any development on Windows anymore yeah but I said the only difference that I've seen has just been the commands that I use so I I don't think as long as you know how to use a Mac it really doesn't take that long to get used to the differences so I wouldn't worry about that if anyone else has a different experience than that please let me know and let Jim Schrader note John says once you have the code inside your editor I don't believe that matters what your operating system is on your machine yes I mean that that's for sure I mean most of the which you do is going to be inside the editor and you can use the same editor on pretty much any machine you know if you're using like Adam or Visual Studio code so it should be fine no matter what you're using world's asked if I heard back from the Pittsburgh job interview yeah actually do you don't want an update on that I can give you an update on that now yeah why don't I just give you an update now so I had I don't know my Internet's cutting out again all right let me give it a second before I say anything all right it looks all right now so I had this interview a few weeks ago it went well and about a a week week and a half after the interview I got an offer from this company so the offer was pretty good it wasn't it wasn't quite as much as I was expecting so I did a little bit of you know talked with the company let him know more of like what what my salary expectations were and you know like what I was basically like what I was dealing with and why I expected a higher salary you know just in terms of you know my family my expenses and things so they they were I'm still waiting on some information so tomorrow I should get more info back on exactly what they can do in terms of compensation to give me more than their initial offer so I have not made my final decision yet as to whether I do want to work at this other place it's it's going to depend on what information I get tomorrow so basically I have my numbers in mind of what it would take for me to leave where I'm at right now so if those numbers get met I probably will leave otherwise I'll stay I've already talked it over with my family and so yeah at this point it's just you know does it make financial sense to move to go somewhere else or not so we'll find out you know hopefully tomorrow I will get the the info so they said it would be tomorrow so I'm that's what I'm gonna be able to make my final decision but after the whole process is over maybe I can make a little video and explaining more what happened I just I don't want to comment on it too much while it's happening I think I'll have a much better perspective on the whole process once it's all done with and I'll be able to give I don't like a much better explanation of the the whole thing let's see all right Julio says you can use builtin get instead of the terminal way I I guess you mean like they get stuff built into Visual Studio code I've never tried to use any of the stuff built into Visual Studio code to be honest with you I I just I mean when I learned get initially I just learned all the command line stuff and so I don't I really know how to use the other stuff I sing videos says what is the WordPress REST API exactly okay so the WordPress REST API is so you have your regular WordPress installation so any of the ones that are using the latest versions of WordPress they're really any version for I think at least the last year we'll have the REST API built in so what you can do is send a query to the REST API and they'll give you data back in JSON format right so it's just it works like any REST API so you can get all you get a bunch of data from from WordPress so by default you can't get everything but with the right plugins or you know custom PHP you can pretty much get all the data you want from WordPress so it allows you to use WordPress as a content management system without using the display part of WordPress so WordPress themes and and all that you can just get the data out and use it wherever you want on on other web sites that aren't wordpress based let me know if that explanation cleared things up for you I can go kind of in more depth or show some examples of the data if you need me to the candy gamer extreme asks in your opinion is it too late to start coding after you join your uni or is it still possible to make a good career oh yeah it's never too late to start coding no yeah I didn't start coding until after I was done with uni and my wife's learning to code right now and she's she didn't start learning to code until she's 32 so yeah never too late to start learning to code bark char so has just dropped in how often do you stream I try to stream Monday through Friday every day I don't always get there but that's that's the goal but for sure I usually stream you know a few times a week at at least Aniki says if you're really into editor performance I guess them would take the cake I didn't even think about them but yeah I suppose them would probably be the most performant one them was last time I tried them I was I was a little lost so I haven't tried it since then I'd like to try it again at some point I hear if you really do learn them it's it's good for productivity so I would I'd really need to take the time to get to learn it first so maybe someday I will okay I'm under the bottom alright I think up to the bottom there were a few comments and things that I kind of skipped over a bit mainly because there are conversations back and forth me too and other people in the chat but now that you all who are watching this recording can view the live chat as well I'll probably not read off everything like I did before that should help keep the streams just a little bit shorter maybe a little bit easier to follow along with oh we did get one more question corrington says hi Jesse what's the font you're using in your text editor I don't know let's find out where we had settings/preferences maybe settings yeah let's get rid of this alright the font family is Menlo so I'm assuming it's Menlo so there we are does anyone have a font that they really think is better for for coding I'm opening I mean I know that's gonna have a huge difference in readability and things so I'm definitely open to changing changing things up yeah no problem course and then let me know if I'm mispronouncing the name that name I want to get it right if I can all right so I see icing video says thank you for that answer about WordPress api's would you be able to use any API available at Google etc thanks for helpful oh yeah for sure you can use any API you want from from reacts or from a lot of other things for that matter but yeah we could pull in from wherever we need to get the data from and the process would be somewhat similar right you know all API is have their differences in how you're supposed to use them but you know it basically making the calls fetching the data getting back JSON format and then filtering and sorting that and displaying it on the page that that's going to be the same no matter where you're getting the data from okay so fire a code with ligatures all right is that is that a font is that a font that's like wellknown enough that I could just use it let's see where did it take my stuff copy the settings there we are so can I do so would it work like that is that the name can I get it to work or what I have to like bring it in somehow need to download it okay so maybe I need to download that what was the other one console us so John says try consoles I'm gonna leave that there in case I download it then it might it might work so let's leave that there is the first one and then we'll do ok cool for this one let's check it out huh oh I like that I might try this out for a little while then nonono that changes things okay so I can get I can get fire code on github okay cool I'll have to try that out maybe let's just check it out right now this this will probably the last thing we do on the stream but if I don't do it right now I'll probably forget cuz I don't feel a lot I'm probably gonna go home right after this maybe I can get it on vs code right away cool alright oh cool sure see cool alright so let's try it I need to let's go back here but I still I'm open huh yeah all right so let's change it up to fire code and I need I need to add these so those it's all together and then what was that ligatures they're gonna let me just change this editor font like it sure is true okay so yeah it doesn't look like it works what am I missing does work you can try restarting it or wrapping it let's make sure I wrap that properly yeah the kitchen I restarting maybe I can try that then yeah let's restart yeah I got an update coming anyway so I was well retry okay nikki says the ligatures make things like like the arrow function look like an actual arrow that's cool very cool okay nikki says check out the installation instructions so let's see now that i happily get yours on alright so not yet alright let me go back to the installation instructions then cool I will download this first I don't install on a Mac oh I can just do home bro let's do that yeah let's just run home bro all right cool now that's not supported all right fine I'll just do it this way just like the old phone calls rightclick and select open go select install font okay cool what just happened no this is not what I wanted to happen all right there's instructions all files right click open select install flaunt that is not what just happened when I followed this instructions I think like this is not how I normally install fonts alright let's open a new Finder window alright I got my stuff my windows open on another page so that's why I'm not seeing that much happening so all right so on a Mac download it right there's another way for sure to do this right isn't there a fonts folder all right insult etfs then it is going to work okay cool that's what I just did I'll tell you my angel tshirt all right cool so I took the TTF file so I'll put them in the font folder so let's see what happened wait is this it is this working huh yay cool all right so just just to show you all what I needed to do when I do my other screen so am i Mac I have like under my username I went into library which is a hidden folder and then the fonts' and then I just drove over so I downloaded there were several files that came up so one of them was the TTF file so I just grabbed everything that's in the TTF file and then I drug it over to here and then it just started working so you can see I've done this before with fonts which didn't remember I did it so all the Roboto stuff that I have in here materiai cons and things like that are in here already alright cool that that looks really cool Wow yeah a lot of stuff looks yeah you can definitely tell the difference awesome very cool all right all right well I think that's it for the stream so I hope that I don't get even more sick than I am right now and that I will come to work tomorrow and be able to strain if I can't strain tomorrow then you probably know where I'm at I'm home in bed but I will most likely be able to stream at my big normal time tomorrow I don't think I have a lot going on so I'll probably be around noon sometime thank you all so much for watching and for helping out for all your advice and for helping each other out in the live chat it was some great questions and answers today and yeah so see y'all tomorrow and until then have a wonderful day
