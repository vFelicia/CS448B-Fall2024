With timestamps:

00:05 - hey everyone welcome to live coding with
00:08 - Jessie today we're going to continue
00:12 - with our live search component and we're
00:18 - gonna try first to search through a lot
00:25 - more than we attempted to search through
00:27 - last week just to see what kind of
00:30 - performance we get when we do a search
00:32 - like that and you know how many entries
00:35 - were likely to get on you know a single
00:38 - search and then after we see what that
00:45 - looks like on the page I think we can
00:47 - continue on with kind of building out
00:48 - the UI so that's the plan for today I do
00:53 - have a meeting in two hours so like the
00:58 - stream to be about you know now
01:00 - somewhere between an hour and hour and a
01:01 - half I should give us plenty of time to
01:03 - get some things done and you know answer
01:05 - a lot of questions I hope everyone had a
01:11 - good weekend I I wasn't feeling well
01:18 - like Saturday so I actually really
01:22 - wanted to do a lot of coding get things
01:24 - done on Saturday and I ended up not so
01:28 - so it was it was weird and just mental
01:35 - health update and to help anyone else
01:37 - out there so I was feeling a little bit
01:40 - sick Saturday and my my kids were at my
01:47 - parents and my wife was gone so it was
01:50 - like I hadn't worked out in a day or two
01:54 - because I wasn't feeling well I was just
01:57 - by myself I was trying to get a lot of
02:00 - stuff done feeling a little bit
02:02 - overwhelmed and my depression and
02:04 - anxiety were just really bad so it maybe
02:07 - was a combination of you know a lot of
02:10 - different factors of
02:13 - you know this the sickness not
02:15 - exercising you know being lonely and you
02:19 - know all those factors I think may be
02:21 - combined so this is just something for
02:24 - me to watch out watch out for and maybe
02:27 - for for you all to watch out for if
02:29 - you're dealing with the same kind of
02:30 - kind of thing so I was kind of really
02:33 - pumped to be able to get all the stuff
02:35 - done but you know I just couldn't and so
02:40 - I'm gonna have to watch out for that
02:41 - next time and maybe come up with a
02:45 - different plan you know to keep myself
02:48 - up and and on target when I'm not really
02:51 - feeling well so all right so let's get
02:56 - onto some coding so we have a lot more
02:58 - people watching now I wanted to wait
03:01 - till we had a few more people in until I
03:03 - share this link here is the end rot link
03:09 - for this project so if you click on that
03:11 - link you'll be able to see the project
03:14 - that I'm locally working on you'll be
03:17 - able to see that in your browser and
03:19 - anytime I make changes it'll be
03:21 - reflected immediately in your browser so
03:24 - you can use dev tools on it and search
03:28 - around in different pages and you know
03:30 - you're not limited to just seeing what I
03:32 - happen to have on my screen at any given
03:34 - time I am now going to switch so that
03:38 - you all can see what's what's happening
03:42 - all right Michael said I know the
03:44 - feeling went through the same things
03:45 - this weekend yeah I am I'm feeling a
03:49 - little bit better now like mentally way
03:54 - I'm feeling I'm feeling better yeah but
03:58 - it was just yeah Saturday was just a
04:02 - weird weird day
04:05 - but did get some good news over the
04:08 - weekend so Saturday night Saturday
04:13 - evening at some point I found out that I
04:16 - was accepted to speak at the moms can
04:20 - code virtual summit so it's it's like a
04:23 - week-long conference
04:25 - it's all online and there are 40
04:29 - speakers 39 of the speakers are women I
04:33 - I'm the only man that got accepted so
04:37 - I'm I guess I'm pretty honored to be on
04:40 - that list and I feel pressure that I
04:47 - guess I need to do a good job to justify
04:50 - me being on on that list but anyway
04:54 - that's that's really cool I'm excited
04:57 - about that and that'll be sometime in
05:01 - April so you'll see me I'll be tweeting
05:03 - about that one more info comes out okay
05:10 - so let's all right that was a different
05:13 - page I was working on so I've been
05:15 - working on the data we have stored in
05:18 - WordPress trying to get things in shape
05:21 - because you know some of it came over in
05:24 - fragments we're like we have a page but
05:26 - then each section of the page came over
05:28 - as a different post type so I'm trying
05:32 - to consolidate those and just make sense
05:34 - of them
05:42 - michael says Congrats I think have they
05:45 - seen the picture of you with the beard I
05:47 - don't know what picture they saw good
05:49 - pictures this of me so yeah I mean some
05:53 - of my social media pictures and a lot of
05:57 - my videos I don't have a beard so I
06:01 - don't I don't know so let's go to the
06:06 - search page and if you want to follow
06:11 - along on your computer our search page
06:14 - is just slash search so first thing I
06:22 - want to do is start this Pomodoro timer
06:26 - so we do our first coding session and
06:28 - then let's go in and add post types onto
06:33 - our search query that we were doing so I
06:37 - was working on this page and let me push
06:42 - this I just committed my changes and now
06:48 - they're on github all right so now the
06:51 - code on github is completely up to date
06:54 - with what I have here locally I also I
06:59 - don't know how many of you remember or
07:00 - following along at all with one of the
07:03 - side projects that I'm working on that
07:05 - was a JavaScript AF and we had a lot of
07:12 - we had a lot of ideas for the site but I
07:14 - think we're narrowing the focus I don't
07:18 - want to have a site with a bunch of
07:19 - different features and none of them not
07:21 - have enough time to really perfect any
07:23 - of them I'd rather have a site that does
07:25 - one thing really well so we're focusing
07:29 - this site on being a place where you can
07:31 - find and share really cool github repos
07:36 - like javascript github repos so it'll
07:42 - just have a nice UI and whereas the site
07:45 - github is not focused so much on
07:47 - discovering new repos and being able to
07:49 - search for them you can do that but the
07:52 - focus is being able to actually update
07:55 - merge and maintain repositories this
07:57 - site is not going to have any of that
07:58 - it's just gonna have a really kind of
08:02 - nice search function and you know
08:05 - potentially a way to upvote repositories
08:09 - and try to share I'd really like to get
08:11 - some of these some of the things that
08:12 - people are working on that aren't really
08:13 - well-known maybe they don't have a lot
08:15 - of stars to get those some more exposure
08:19 - to the community especially some maybe
08:22 - the more unique things that are
08:25 - happening with JavaScript I think it'd
08:27 - be cool to highlight so if anybody's
08:29 - interested in that at all you have any
08:31 - ideas or feedback or you'd like to
08:32 - contribute to that
08:34 - check out my github repo the project is
08:37 - JavaScript
08:38 - - AF and then we also have an API hard
08:42 - just came in the live chat and I will
08:44 - mention that Harshit has done the
08:45 - majority of the coding for this project
08:47 - unfortunately I've been too busy over
08:49 - the last month to contribute much in the
08:53 - way of code so I guess I've been kind of
08:56 - guiding things just with with ideas and
08:59 - encouragement for now and Harsha's on a
09:01 - ton of the work so thank you to harsh it
09:04 - for that but I welcome anyone else to
09:07 - you know be involved if you want to it's
09:09 - it's a react project so if you're
09:13 - interested in reactors that and then
09:15 - Harsha and it could tell you more than a
09:17 - live chat about how we're building how
09:19 - he's building the backend and the API
09:21 - part of it
09:22 - if anyone's if anyone's interested all
09:29 - right so here's our search page where's
09:32 - our oops this is probably so small I
09:35 - apologize there we are okay so I'm on
09:42 - the search page so if you are following
09:47 - along locally or in the repository it's
09:52 - in the pages folder in its search j/s
09:55 - and we're down here at the I could
10:00 - shrink this up a bit
10:02 - and this makes
10:04 - more space so this is that that query
10:09 - that I was talking about see see right
10:11 - now we're not really getting that many
10:13 - post types so we're getting admissions
10:15 - pages and chapel pages so I just want to
10:19 - keep adding on a few more types and I'm
10:27 - gonna on my other screen I'm gonna check
10:31 - out some of the types we have so I can
10:35 - add them in quickly so let's go one two
10:39 - three four five let's try to add five
10:41 - types for now so we can have let's just
10:50 - have let's see faculty and major and I
11:07 - think all of these are singular if they
11:12 - don't work I guess then we'll find out
11:14 - and Department see what else most of you
11:24 - have
11:32 - academics page
11:47 - one more what's it gonna be
11:57 - if I include news it's gonna be a lot
12:00 - well I want to test see what we can
12:03 - handle so let's include news in here
12:09 - alright so I'm gonna save that and let's
12:13 - see if it works
12:15 - we'll just search for a really common
12:17 - word see if we get back a lot okay see
12:28 - we're getting here so we got a
12:31 - department admissions pages chapel page
12:41 - academics major okay but it looks like
12:50 - we didn't get anything from News which
12:52 - is odd I mean I'm pretty sure the word
12:58 - the is his in some of these news posts
13:03 - see did I mess up that last one and type
13:12 - news
13:17 - I may have to check to see how I put
13:26 - news in there in our custom plugin
14:06 - yeah news it should be news I didn't use
14:10 - yeah news was the rest yeah so I had for
14:18 - the rest API
14:29 - that's pretty weird not sure what's
14:32 - going on there
14:38 - let's see if if there's some sort of
14:40 - limit and so let's move news up here I
14:51 - don't need this type post or type page
14:57 - because we don't have anything in posts
14:59 - or pages right now anyway
15:27 - okay
15:39 - search I can't tell if the searched
15:41 - again or not
15:55 - okay we're still not getting any news
15:58 - it's weird
16:37 - I listen to see
16:47 - all right not really sure why that's
16:50 - happening with the news pages I'm gonna
16:57 - check the live chat here to see if if
16:59 - any of you said anything about that or
17:01 - if you're getting different results on
17:03 - your your local version
17:36 - all right
17:44 - I wonder
17:49 - alright let me know what you all think
17:52 - about this so clearly we're not getting
17:57 - everything that we could be getting here
17:59 - for some reason we're getting nothing
18:01 - from news not even if I search for news
18:09 - there we are finally so we did get news
18:16 - now this is I wonder I don't think I
18:31 - have any caching setup
18:50 - yeah
18:55 - all right this
19:05 - I wonder if it's limiting our results by
19:08 - that 100
19:23 - maybe that's it I mean I'm not gonna
19:26 - count these but I figure we're probably
19:29 - getting a hundred if I can get a number
19:32 - here yep we're getting a hundred results
19:34 - so we're limited to that hundred which
19:39 - is not bad so we do all right
19:48 - here's here's my idea let's
20:02 - we're just gonna have to do either a
20:06 - button here that says more results or do
20:10 - an infinite scroll since we are limited
20:14 - by that 101 100 posts for a search
20:22 - I don't well I'll tell you what it has
20:28 - been a while since I checked the API
20:30 - documentation for WordPress it used to
20:33 - be and it might still be that you
20:34 - couldn't go over that 100 limit let's
20:37 - see if you can now let's just let's say
20:43 - 500 I yeah I don't think this will work
20:49 - I think 100 is like a hard limit but
20:53 - we'll we'll test it
21:03 - whoa yeah so that that must have given
21:08 - us an error when we tried to
21:18 - see
21:21 - and did we have area
21:29 - what's fun over using we don't have the
21:34 - the limit here it's gonna say we could
21:36 - see exactly I suspect we're getting this
21:38 - back I will copy and paste that into
21:44 - here so we can see what's happening
21:46 - we'll give it this per page 500 let's
21:55 - see
21:56 - whoops who's over here
22:07 - and
22:34 - okay we're getting something back but
22:37 - it's definitely not oops
22:46 - this isn't what I need right I made that
22:53 - I did that wrong no rest route and that
23:00 - is how we have it in here will pose now
23:05 - I flipped it around sorry about that
23:27 - okay so that's an invalid parameter we
23:31 - can't use 500 we can't use 200 we can't
23:43 - use 101 so I think it is still 100 as
23:46 - the limit okay yep all right so we're
23:49 - limited to 100 limited 100 here it's not
24:04 - going to be a huge problem I said we can
24:07 - do the search the infinite scroll type
24:13 - of search or have users hit a button
24:15 - either way and then we're going to have
24:21 - a lot of options for users to choose
24:26 - exactly what type of content they want
24:29 - so assuming that they're only choosing
24:33 - one type of content like let's say they
24:35 - only want faculty members to come up in
24:39 - their search we're fine we're now going
24:41 - to go over the limit especially if
24:46 - they're saying I only want faculty
24:47 - members and I want them from this
24:48 - specific department or I want the
24:50 - faculty member that has this name right
24:52 - there that's going to be okay the news
24:58 - will probably be the only post type that
25:01 - it really has more than hey sorry let's
25:07 - try to hold back a yawn
25:12 - so yea News definitely has more than a
25:16 - hundred so that will come into play if
25:20 - somebody searches a very common term and
25:23 - wants to know about news hmm
25:32 - okay yeah we're just gonna have to deal
25:35 - with that so I think I think we're okay
25:39 - right now yeah we're okay right now
25:46 - let's work on some of those let's work
25:48 - on some of the filters then I think
25:50 - before Before we jump into UI stuff kind
25:55 - of like wow my mind is still on that
25:58 - search query I think it would be a good
26:00 - time to do that if I switch back into
26:02 - like design mode it'll be harder to
26:07 - switch back if I want to do it so let's
26:10 - just put in some some test filters and
26:15 - see how they're gonna work so what will
26:19 - happen then is this whole portion of
26:23 - n-type news and all that that those are
26:28 - going to be variables just like search
26:31 - term is so let's see how we'll do this
26:37 - so let's take this and type news and
26:42 - copy that that's going to be the
26:44 - template and we're getting the search
26:47 - term right now from that gets saved and
26:53 - state I believe and why are we not okay
26:59 - let's see
27:02 - there's our input
27:13 - all right so we have on change get
27:16 - search results so let's go up til I get
27:19 - search results function search good ok I
27:32 - don't know what I was thinking so search
27:33 - term is passed into this function I'm
27:39 - not sure I want it to happen like that
27:41 - I think I may rather have the input be a
27:44 - controlled component so it actually goes
27:46 - up here and in state and then we don't
27:50 - pass anything through here we can just
27:52 - run it from whatever's happens to be in
27:55 - state at that time so let's let's do
28:00 - that so first thing we're gonna do we're
28:04 - gonna change this and we're going to say
28:07 - search term and we're just gonna
28:09 - initialize that to an empty string not
28:15 - equals we initialize that to an empty
28:19 - string so for a search term it's we're
28:23 - gonna say this state search term and we
28:30 - don't need this anymore
28:32 - and then down here we're gonna call
28:37 - fetch search term but we don't need that
28:42 - search value anymore and then here and
28:48 - put on change we're gonna put a value ID
28:53 - and there it's gonna get its value from
28:56 - this
28:59 - now we don't let's just say search term
29:04 - whoops
29:07 - and we're going to whoops not under
29:16 - props we're gonna do this and we're
29:23 - gonna say search term and now we're
29:31 - gonna say this state and what are my
29:38 - lines for not search CR CH T or and why
29:50 - can't I do that I'm pretty sure I can do
29:54 - that right
29:58 - okay
30:00 - let me check my time while I'm over here
30:02 - okay only about a minute left so let's
30:04 - just see if this works now well let me
30:08 - type in okay this state data map is not
30:11 - a function X as I didn't get any data
30:13 - oops
30:22 - that's weird
30:24 - okay I messed something up in this flow
30:27 - of let's see search term oh okay
30:35 - I'm not actually changing event default
30:41 - concert so it's unfocused keyword so I'm
30:46 - not actually setting setting state so
30:51 - I'm gonna set the stay here this set
31:04 - states and we're gonna go search term
31:11 - search
31:18 - Hey
31:26 - so it I have a floor
31:36 - no it's not working
31:58 - dony I think I need something else okay
32:05 - I would say our Christopher said it
32:14 - should be this state equals you did
32:19 - state equals all right what line was
32:26 - that
32:33 - okay yeah all right all right let me let
32:37 - me set my five-minute timer so I can go
32:39 - back to the live chat and answer some
32:40 - questions then I'll come back and
32:41 - troubleshoot why why the values not
32:45 - working for that that inflated I suspect
32:49 - I'm just messing something up syntax why
32:52 - somewhere hey everybody who said hi at
32:58 - the beginning I forgot to say hi to you
33:01 - off also thanks for everyone saying
33:10 - congratulations for me being able to
33:12 - speak at the moms can code summit a
33:16 - noble and savage says you big rough
33:20 - rough looking man with giggle haha also
33:26 - says how he all doing I just started
33:29 - that 100 days thing to give me motivated
33:34 - to do many hours a day awesome my wife
33:38 - still in the hundred days of code as
33:40 - well so that's that's really cool I hope
33:43 - you hope you do all your days and learn
33:47 - a lot and build cool stuff all right
33:50 - Nikki has a crypto question so I
33:53 - mentioned it last week that I started
33:54 - doing a tutorial to build distributed
33:59 - apps on the ethereum blockchain using a
34:03 - language called solidity I think its
34:07 - solidity um and the tutorial is crypto
34:12 - zombies that I uh
34:14 - Sonique es is it going out to the
34:18 - Internet
34:18 - every time that zombie eat kitty
34:21 - function runs so true the blockchain to
34:24 - be specific I think so I think how that
34:31 - I did that lesson yeah so I think all
34:37 - those
34:42 - assuming that it's connected up to the
34:44 - blockchain like and not in some sandbox
34:47 - environment then I think all of those
34:49 - main functions or do go through the
34:54 - blockchain which I guess makes sense
34:57 - right because then that would that would
34:59 - change like important information
35:01 - because you would get a new zombie so
35:05 - it'd be a new zombie with new DNA
35:07 - assigned to your specific ID so I do I
35:16 - believe so but I'm still going this
35:19 - route through the tutorial I'm on lesson
35:22 - five now no but I'm not not at all an
35:28 - expert on it okay I should say and maybe
35:33 - show the progress on the test domain for
35:35 - the JavaScript raf project yeah we'll
35:38 - see how much time is left after I get
35:40 - your questions and stuff and after this
35:42 - next Pomodoro session and then we may do
35:45 - that or maybe if not today then I'm sure
35:49 - at some point this week we can we can
35:51 - show it off a bit
36:09 - okay Chris you're saying doesn't npm
36:12 - sort of do that JavaScript they have
36:13 - thing well I guess I mean NPM doesn't
36:18 - have NPM wouldn't necessarily have all
36:22 - the the projects there's so like not
36:25 - every JavaScript project on github is
36:28 - also an NPM unless I'm wrong and let me
36:31 - know if I'm wrong about that
36:41 - and I do want your honest opinion about
36:43 - the project Rea because if if you all
36:46 - think that it's a ridiculous idea this
36:48 - this github repo search thing with
36:52 - JavaScript dot AF let me know because
36:56 - I'd rather not spend a bunch of time
36:58 - working on something that's that nobody
37:01 - wants or nobody thinks will be useful so
37:03 - constructive criticism is definitely
37:05 - welcome I may try to do some live
37:10 - streams on my own channel where I work
37:13 - on that project and then that way you
37:16 - all can get kind of a better idea of
37:18 - what's going on Christopher says on your
37:26 - Franciscan page the nav links probably
37:29 - need some indication of hub or other
37:30 - than mouse pointer send these ones yeah
37:39 - let me think ok so I I'm I'm not a
37:46 - hundred percent sure I want to add
37:48 - another indication but if we were to add
37:50 - another indication that these are
37:53 - clickable what should it be
37:56 - so I'm up for suggestions here keep in
37:59 - mind I would like it to be as material
38:02 - design issue as possible
38:05 - but let me know if we're gonna have
38:08 - anything I would like it to be subtle I
38:10 - don't want a lot of crazy motion or
38:12 - something like that no like text getting
38:14 - a lot bigger stuff but I'm I am open to
38:20 - subtle something subtle I'll at least
38:23 - consider that if you all think it would
38:27 - it would really help okay
38:30 - so didn't quite get through all the
38:32 - questions this time we'll get to the
38:34 - rest of them after this next Pomodoro
38:37 - session
38:45 - alright let me reset the timer and let's
38:48 - figure out what I did wrong why this
38:50 - isn't working
38:53 - alright so let me let me walk through
38:56 - the flow of what should happen then so
38:58 - initially initially a search term and
39:01 - state to be an empty string so initially
39:04 - the value in our input should be search
39:14 - term and we should be able to get search
39:22 - term from here right that's why we don't
39:25 - need to write this state down here then
39:30 - on change it goes to this dot get search
39:33 - results so let's go up there let me see
39:37 - as well as psycho searches so when we go
39:40 - to get search results
39:47 - oops
39:52 - all right I see what the problem is I
39:54 - did this all in the wrong place
39:57 - shoot I'm gonna have to undo a lot of
40:01 - stuff here
40:09 - I'm gonna be copy this
40:23 - so I had we left in some there we go
40:29 - yeah yeah we I left in some functions
40:37 - that we may need at some point but right
40:41 - now we don't need so that's kind of
40:43 - that's what happened there all right so
40:47 - what I need to do then is go call this
40:50 - set state and put in a search term and
41:05 - set that equal to value okay and the
41:13 - reason we're doing that before we do
41:14 - this is that this is going to determine
41:18 - the value of that input so I don't want
41:20 - to debounce or check for length of that
41:23 - input right so otherwise I'd be able to
41:26 - type two characters and nothing would
41:28 - show up in my input all right so that's
41:33 - that's not what what we want so we want
41:38 - state to get set immediately and then we
41:42 - can also check here to make sure before
41:46 - we actually search anything that what
41:50 - we're debouncing so we don't search too
41:52 - many times and we're also not going to
41:53 - search for tiny strings okay so with
42:02 - that and that let's go down here and add
42:05 - this back in and let's add our value
42:12 - back in the value is gonna equals search
42:19 - term
42:21 - and this makes sure nothing changed I
42:23 - don't believe we went back so far that
42:26 - anything else changed yet up here okay
42:32 - let's say that see if it works
42:35 - there we are okay good so now our just
42:43 - to show what's what's really happening
42:45 - let's go into react and make this bigger
42:49 - maybe too big make this whole thing big
43:17 - there we go so here's our search term in
43:21 - our state and we say it says the now so
43:24 - if I go back we have a th there so you
43:30 - see every time I type this is updated so
43:34 - this is what we call a controlled input
43:36 - a controlled component we're essentially
43:43 - on a good way to remember this is the
43:46 - value of the input is controlled by
43:48 - state so when you type something in
43:53 - state is updated so the dataflow as you
43:57 - type state is updated and then the value
44:01 - of the component gets updated so as soon
44:03 - as state changes a rerender happens and
44:06 - when that rerender happens the value of
44:09 - this input is changed based on the value
44:11 - state okay so that's how the flow goes
44:15 - it may not seem like it makes a lot of
44:18 - sense or adds any benefit here when we
44:20 - only have one input but as we continue
44:22 - to add our filters on it does you'll see
44:27 - that it does make it easier when you
44:30 - have more form input so these that's
44:32 - been what I found is is that it's it is
44:36 - nicer in in those cases
44:48 - okay
44:59 - I think let's let's commit that right so
45:05 - I think this is enough of a feature that
45:08 - we can commit this before we add in some
45:11 - more inputs so I'm going to again status
45:15 - make sure of what we changed get add and
45:19 - then we'll do our yarn CM so this is
45:22 - particularly this project we have kind
45:26 - of a special kind of format that it
45:31 - takes you through so you can see this
45:33 - let's do a refactor yeah who do you
45:41 - think refactor would be appropriate oh
45:46 - yeah we'll say refactor and we're just
45:49 - gonna say
46:00 - we factor search input to be a
46:02 - controlled input okay great
46:04 - and this doesn't break anything and it
46:07 - does not affect any open issues now it's
46:18 - going to roll the tests once it passes
46:20 - we can commit this to our github repo
46:23 - great whoops get push origin there we
46:33 - are okay
46:44 - all right so now that we have that all
46:47 - sorted we can add in our filter there so
46:53 - this is what I was attempting to do at
46:55 - first and then realize that we needed to
47:01 - do some more work
47:02 - so let's as I was trying to do before
47:06 - grab this first one this type news just
47:11 - as to use as our template I guess and
47:14 - we're gonna let's see we're gonna create
47:23 - an item and States how are you gonna do
47:32 - this
47:40 - all right I'm sure we'll refactor this
47:43 - as we go on I'm gonna try something
47:45 - first we'll test and see if it works and
47:47 - then maybe it can be improved but so at
47:50 - first we're gonna do search type and
47:58 - this will be a string and let's just for
48:01 - now we're just going to put search type
48:03 - news in there and what do I need to grab
48:07 - type news and do we want the end there
48:12 - all the time
48:16 - we went up we want the end to be here
48:20 - okay so search site news and forget like
48:30 - okay
48:44 - and then we're going to let's take all
48:49 - of this get rid of it for now even this
48:55 - let's take all of this get rid of it for
48:58 - now and throw it over here just kind of
49:02 - in our scrap for the file and because
49:06 - we'll refer to that a little bit later
49:08 - but what we want to do back here where
49:11 - we took all this stuff out is we want to
49:15 - put in a class we could do
49:28 - we'll just concatenate these two
49:39 - the state search type right
49:49 - why is this not working
49:58 - you're
50:03 - why is he giving me an error this state
50:08 - search type
50:21 - as we
50:31 - okay
50:35 - okay so it does work I don't I don't
50:38 - know what was up with that error I guess
50:41 - it didn't like that space in there but
50:44 - you can see we've I don't know how if
50:48 - it's easy to see this down at the bottom
50:50 - here but we have our search did exactly
51:00 - we have the search term though and then
51:02 - the type equals news so now if we want
51:06 - to change what we're searching for all
51:08 - we have to do is change this in state
51:12 - this search type so what we can do now
51:15 - is add our inputs that are going to
51:20 - change what we're searching and each one
51:26 - of those will change this value here so
51:30 - here's what I'm thinking it'll be check
51:33 - boxes because we don't want to limit
51:36 - users to only search one thing at a time
51:38 - that would be I could see that as being
51:41 - annoying that a user picked the wrong
51:43 - category they're not sure exactly what
51:46 - they want and they have to go through
51:47 - like four different categories searching
51:49 - for the same thing in each category
51:52 - that's that's annoying what if they say
51:55 - well I think it might be in one of these
51:57 - four categories so I'm gonna search for
51:58 - all four of these categories at once so
52:00 - that's why I like the idea of checkboxes
52:02 - as opposed to radio buttons so we will
52:05 - have checkboxes for each of the search
52:07 - items if you've ever been to amazon.com
52:11 - you notice that on their search they go
52:14 - mostly with the check boxes so we're
52:17 - gonna go with something like that and so
52:21 - each check box that's checked is going
52:26 - to update what is in search type now
52:31 - we're going to do this
52:37 - this is what I was pausing to think
52:40 - about before and I said I would just put
52:41 - it off the best way to not only add to
52:47 - this string but also remove items as
52:52 - well
53:02 - series
53:15 - oh how about this what if instead of
53:22 - just having search type to search tight
53:26 - we have we had can we can we do this
53:32 - search type
53:52 - is let's go
53:57 - majors do we have majored yet this would
54:07 - be insight major faculty is gonna give
54:19 - us okay so you get what I'm doing here
54:30 - okay and then what we would do is map so
54:42 - we would look through this so every time
54:45 - the search happens you would loop
54:49 - through this and then add these together
54:54 - so essentially a search happens
54:56 - everything's cleared then gets added
55:00 - again and that's on search or that
55:07 - happens on click of a checkbox so we
55:10 - just go through and and add those in
55:16 - yeah okay let me check the the live chat
55:21 - because I think some of you are
55:22 - commenting on this as well
55:30 - oh okay Alexander's saying it's hard to
55:32 - read the console you know what I I had
55:35 - moved my where my my video shows up when
55:39 - I made that so Friday afternoon I made a
55:43 - I think it was Friday afternoon maybe
55:45 - Thursday anyway I made a video about
55:50 - installing node and and get and cloning
55:55 - a repo to your local machine and getting
55:58 - it up and running kind of just like a
56:00 - beginner's basics video and I posted
56:03 - that on my channel so if you're new to
56:06 - get and github check that out maybe it
56:08 - might it may be helpful for you
56:10 - but anyway what I was doing in that
56:12 - video made more sense for me to have my
56:14 - thing over here and I forgot to move it
56:16 - back thank you for bringing that up
56:17 - though I apologize if this has been
56:20 - covering things up the whole time john
56:31 - hanson saying it could be an array of
56:33 - objects michael says is there a way to
56:37 - group checkboxes in a frame and then
56:39 - build a search query of the check boxes
56:42 - in the frame i know access could do it
56:47 - john says you could also make those
56:49 - default value as false and true on
56:53 - checkbox
57:04 - okay all right let's go let me let me
57:10 - test things out which is these three
57:11 - will make some check boxes and then see
57:14 - if the concept itself is just working at
57:17 - all and then we can refactor after that
57:29 - l exam dove saying this state search
57:32 - type as an array okay yeah actually we
57:37 - could do it and I think somebody else
57:39 - mentioned it as well as well what about
57:41 - an array of objects yeah let's do an
57:43 - array of objects that makes sense let's
57:52 - see if it'll let me do this yes
58:13 - but we don't need this to be defined
58:15 - with you talking about
58:22 - oops
58:39 - all right they don't like that
58:54 - Alexander says who you would separate
58:56 - the URL creation from the logic
59:12 - okay we need some checkboxes now should
59:19 - we check material UI yeah whoops let's
59:24 - check this component selects it's any
59:38 - checkboxes click the wrong thing
59:53 - wait there's got to be checkboxes
59:56 - checkbox
59:57 - yeah I'm just missing it in here Oh
60:07 - selection controls that's what it was
60:10 - under control
60:22 - okay
60:30 - let's see this one
60:55 - I guess we can grab all of this
61:07 - and we'll paste it for now we'll just
61:13 - put it right below I know we have this
61:19 - in a form tag but for now I'm going to
61:22 - keep it separate we need form control
61:24 - form label while we need a lot let's
61:27 - just copy and paste
61:37 - okay
61:44 - so we're gonna have to change the values
61:47 - of course just to make sure no the
61:52 - sandals change is not a function alright
61:57 - let's let's bring in the handle change
61:59 - function as well I miss that
62:16 - oh you know what I forgot we already
62:18 - were pulling in some filter stuff it's
62:24 - alright just to get this working for now
62:27 - no change
62:29 - alright cool so here's our our inputs
62:33 - and I wanted to use the material UI ones
62:36 - instead of just throwing in an input
62:37 - like we did here because you know we see
62:41 - we have styling built in so I'll
62:46 - probably adjust the Styles a bit like
62:49 - maybe add a little less space between
62:51 - these but this is basically what we want
63:01 - I don't have that much time left
63:08 - no not enough time left so we need just
63:19 - a price all right that's that's not what
63:23 - we brought in
63:32 - all right I'm at a time for this one
63:35 - we're gonna have to save this I suppose
63:38 - for tomorrow normally I would try to get
63:42 - this done but since I have a meeting
63:44 - coming up I can't I can't go to too much
63:47 - longer so the plan then is and I may
63:51 - just hold off and do this in the next
63:52 - stream we'll see but the plan is just to
63:56 - connect these so that when you check it
63:59 - it does actually change something in
64:00 - state and then once someone were would
64:06 - search or click it takes everything in
64:14 - States these strings and it makes one
64:18 - large string and that's what gets
64:20 - inserted into here so let's you know
64:26 - let's change this now well I'm thinking
64:28 - about it so we need get rid of this and
64:42 - make that blank and then instead of
64:48 - search type this needs to be checkboxes
64:59 - there we go okay so now we can still say
65:03 - where do you search type in here this
65:06 - makes sense now we're saying these are
65:07 - the check box values yeah
65:12 - this may be over complicated to do it
65:14 - like this it's all separate objects so
65:16 - anyway that's that's basically what's
65:21 - going to happen if that works then I'll
65:25 - just add all the possible combinations
65:27 - as check boxes that we want here and and
65:31 - then we need to make clean up the UI a
65:33 - bit so on a large screen you know we
65:37 - could probably display all the options
65:39 - and it wouldn't be an issue on mobile
65:41 - we're gonna have to come up with some
65:43 - other way to display all the options
65:47 - probably some sort of toggle that would
65:50 - display them and then hide them okay so
65:58 - let me go back to our left off in the
66:01 - live chat let me get a drink first
66:13 - so I'm going to go back to where I left
66:15 - off I'm gonna answer as many questions
66:16 - as I can before my meeting I think I
66:18 - should be able to get all the questions
66:20 - and if you have any more questions
66:21 - please put them in the live chat now
66:23 - feel free also to ask me questions in
66:26 - the comments of this video or to send me
66:29 - a question on Twitter or Instagram
66:31 - Facebook email whatever else you can
66:35 - think of I can't always get back to you
66:38 - right away but I do try to eventually
66:40 - get back to everyone that asked me a
66:42 - question
66:53 - see
66:59 - Guerlain says how do I gain abilities
67:02 - like you just practice so I take some
67:11 - like if you haven't already done it go
67:13 - through some of the free chord free code
67:15 - camp challenges you can check out some
67:19 - of the free Udacity free or paid Udacity
67:22 - courses just take advantage of a lot of
67:26 - the online resources that are out there
67:28 - to help you learn more about JavaScript
67:30 - HTML and CSS if you're interested in
67:34 - design I recommend reading through the
67:36 - Google material design documentation if
67:39 - you're not a fan of material design you
67:41 - know check out apple's design stuff I
67:44 - assume Microsoft has something similar
67:47 - for their their style so just just to
67:52 - give you an idea of you know all the
67:54 - thought and and that goes into you know
67:57 - designing a a nice looking and useful
68:01 - user interface and then just practice
68:06 - this keep building things if you can get
68:08 - paid to build that's even better
68:10 - but either way just keep building and I
68:14 - mean that's that's really how it's done
68:15 - there's no substitute just for
68:17 - experience and in practicing so there's
68:23 - a little bit every day if you can is is
68:25 - great sandé says hey do you play csgo I
68:36 - do not play csgo
68:39 - so I'm not currently the only thing that
68:45 - I've been playing and I don't really I
68:48 - don't play every day as Zelda breadth of
68:53 - the wild for Nintendo switch so
68:56 - occasionally I will play that and some
69:00 - usually like if I'm
69:03 - hang out in the morning on exercise bike
69:06 - sometimes I'll play
69:23 - if divi Anshu says hi I just joined what
69:27 - did I miss
69:30 - we were so we tested out some of the
69:38 - limits on the search in terms of how
69:41 - many things we could search for at once
69:42 - and we can search for a hundred things
69:45 - at once we can't go past the hundred
69:47 - thing limit we can search for a bunch of
69:50 - different types of content all at once
69:52 - but we're still limited by that hundred
69:54 - thing limit we made an input into a
70:02 - controlled input so just using state as
70:06 - the value and then making sure we update
70:10 - state every time we change that input
70:12 - and then we add it in some check boxes
70:14 - and those will eventually be used to
70:18 - determine exactly what types of content
70:22 - we will be searching for
70:32 - John said congrats on the talk Thanks
70:36 - thank you I appreciate it siphon siphon
70:41 - X says are you reading this I am now
70:45 - that's your if you're still here
70:47 - I should say even you don't know how
70:55 - large that codebase is gone I'm assuming
70:57 - you're talking about the JavaScript AF
71:00 - yeah I'm sure I I don't know how large
71:04 - the code pieces because I haven't been
71:08 - through it all so in that after saying
71:16 - that hard [ __ ] I mean do you in your
71:19 - opinion do you think it was a good call
71:22 - to say we're just going to focus on one
71:25 - thing instead of trying to do a lot of
71:26 - different things just in terms of being
71:29 - able to manage the repository will that
71:32 - help you cutting things down
71:40 - Aniki says kind of off topic but phantom
71:43 - Jas is having drama and is being retired
71:45 - luckily it kind of got replaced by
71:47 - puppeteer while ago yes yes so I don't
71:53 - know if if anyone knows about this but
71:55 - so phantom Jas was open source project
71:59 - there's just not enough people
72:00 - maintaining it and so they are retiring
72:04 - it I believe they said that it could be
72:08 - revived at a later date but that's not
72:12 - really guaranteed they would need more
72:13 - people to get involved with the project
72:15 - so so I guess I mean when things like
72:19 - this happen it's good to remember these
72:22 - open source projects only exist because
72:24 - people donate their time to help keeping
72:27 - them alive so if you have the ability
72:30 - and the time to keep them alive please
72:34 - please do that and contribute to the
72:36 - projects maybe if if you don't have the
72:39 - time or the ability to contribute maybe
72:43 - consider can
72:44 - tributing money to help keep these
72:46 - projects alive
72:47 - so either way that can be very helpful
72:58 - John says anyone interested in the
73:00 - upcoming changes in react should watch
73:02 - the video sneak peek beyond react 16 on
73:05 - the react JSL work blog a sync rendering
73:09 - time slicing suspense and many other new
73:11 - things yes definitely give that a watch
73:15 - so ya go to react jest or go to the blog
73:19 - check out the video the video is
73:21 - embedded right there in the blog I
73:23 - didn't watch the entire video I watched
73:27 - at least half of it when it came out
73:30 - last week very impressive very exciting
73:34 - so I'm not gonna try to explain it
73:38 - because I'm sure I'll mess it up I only
73:41 - watched it once last week and only
73:43 - halfway through so maybe if I go through
73:46 - the video more and understand it a
73:48 - little better maybe we'll talk about it
73:50 - on the stream but it was cool like when
73:56 - I got to the point in the video when I
73:58 - was really starting to think about okay
74:00 - how could I use this on my projects then
74:04 - it's it started to get exciting it was
74:08 - cool you know thinking about things I've
74:10 - done in past projects that were kind of
74:12 - a pain and in thinking wow if I had this
74:16 - back then it would have been so much
74:19 - better really really cool cool stuff
74:28 - Fernando says hi Jesse I am from
74:30 - Argentina
74:31 - welcome thank you for watching
74:52 - John Ensign says and this is about the
74:55 - new reax there's no more need for
74:56 - debounce yeah you're right I saw that
74:58 - part so there's something that may be
75:01 - coming in react so all these things in
75:03 - reactor like not guaranteed yet none of
75:07 - them are finished so they could change
75:09 - but like there was a thing in there that
75:12 - maybe it would make debounce
75:14 - obsolete so we're using it in this
75:17 - project right now if you just talked
75:19 - about it earlier in the in the stream we
75:21 - saw that line where we're debouncing so
75:23 - we wouldn't need to do that
75:43 - okay hard sink so that show the site if
75:46 - time allows alright let me get through
75:48 - these last few things in the live chat
75:50 - horseshit and check the time Michael
75:56 - says I've hit a brick wall with my free
75:59 - code camp Simon I'm not great at
76:02 - front-end but good at logic I've been
76:04 - fighting a way to make it look good but
76:08 - it breaks my logic is it better to look
76:11 - bad but I'm nice logic or look nice and
76:14 - have spaghetti code on the backend
76:16 - it depends on who's looking at it right
76:19 - from from a user's perspective I guess
76:22 - as long as it works they would prefer
76:25 - that it does look nice and they don't
76:27 - care what the code looks like at all
76:29 - they probably never think about it but
76:31 - if you are going to be showing this to
76:33 - death so if it's going to be on your
76:35 - github repo then you probably do want
76:38 - your code to look nice if it's something
76:41 - you're going to go back to and have to
76:42 - maintain you don't want spaghetti code
76:46 - either so that's interesting that the
76:53 - look of it is breaking the logic I said
76:59 - hmm Michael do you have that on get that
77:04 - project on github and would you mind if
77:07 - I just took a look at it at some point I
77:09 - can't I don't have a lot of time so I
77:12 - can't guarantee I'd be able to do
77:13 - anything but if I get a chance I'd like
77:17 - to at least like just check it out so
77:20 - let me know
77:33 - chef in says hello I'm from Bangladesh
77:36 - hi welcome thanks for watching Chris
77:40 - says that's great advice
77:42 - oh thanks thanks Michael says no no no
77:45 - it was that a no no no to be looking at
77:48 - it alright it's cool it's cool if you
77:55 - don't wanted me to see it I understand
77:58 - but uh alright
78:03 - so I've gotten through everything the
78:04 - live set so I guess I'll have a look
78:10 - yeah let's let's have a look at the the
78:13 - project here so hard [ __ ]
78:16 - Harshit you want me to show the project
78:18 - on the test URL are you cool with people
78:21 - knowing the test URL right now I'm gonna
78:24 - open it on my other screen and wait for
78:26 - an answer here
78:53 - all right some still I'm waiting for
78:57 - response hopefully our she heard me I
79:00 - just want to be sure that the test URL
79:06 - can handle traffic and that it's okay
79:09 - for people to know about it
79:25 - okay there you go all the old stuff was
79:27 - loading I had to refresh it okay cool so
79:30 - let me let me pull this over and I'm
79:34 - just gonna spend just a few minutes on
79:36 - this because I will have to go to my
79:39 - meeting soon but here's a sneak preview
79:41 - of what
79:42 - Harshit has been working on in doing
79:45 - pretty much all the coding for
79:48 - especially all the backend stuff and
79:51 - I've been just somewhat involved and to
79:56 - be honest but this is just a little
80:02 - taste
80:03 - we're not even in beta yet like we'd
80:06 - like to have a beta at some point so
80:08 - very much open to suggestions
80:11 - the idea is you could go here to
80:14 - discover new repositories you could
80:17 - certainly have different criteria for
80:19 - what you would want to how you want to
80:25 - filter these and how do you want to sort
80:28 - them and there will be some sort of way
80:35 - to let's say upvote different
80:38 - repositories so I would like it I'm not
80:44 - gonna say right away that I'm going to
80:46 - exclude the big repositories but I would
80:48 - like to make it so that the big
80:51 - repositories are not always on the top
80:53 - right you know we you can always see
80:55 - like react has it's honest you know
80:59 - reacts up at the top like the the big
81:01 - stuff from big companies are usually at
81:03 - at the top of like the most starred
81:06 - repositories so I everybody already
81:09 - knows about those what I want to
81:11 - highlight are some of the smaller ones
81:12 - so I'm hoping that's what we'll do we'll
81:17 - just have to kind of as we go through
81:21 - beta testing and things we just have to
81:23 - kind of adjust how we're pulling these
81:24 - in to make sure that that happens
81:29 - so here's some of the other things like
81:30 - we have a feed our sugar we are we not
81:33 - doing the feed at first I think that's
81:35 - what what's happening so
81:38 - I think I think we're not gonna have the
81:43 - feed so there was some social media
81:44 - components that we're gonna hold off
81:48 - we're most likely I where either gonna
81:51 - split it into another project or just
81:54 - hold off on them and maybe think about
81:55 - adding them back in at some point but
81:57 - for now I think we're better off
81:59 - focusing on one thing getting that ready
82:03 - so we can actually get it released and
82:05 - doing that one thing well we also had a
82:08 - spot where we were gonna allow people to
82:10 - post jobs so this is one of the other
82:13 - things that may be added on as a feature
82:15 - at some point obviously we're going to
82:18 - have a search which this one currently
82:22 - is searching for people and repositories
82:26 - so for sure we're gonna have a
82:28 - repository search I'll have to check
82:30 - with Harshit on whether the people
82:34 - search adds a lot more complexity or not
82:36 - if it doesn't then we may keep that if
82:40 - you know if not it might just be
82:42 - repositories at first the messaging
82:46 - thing that's another thing that Merriman
82:49 - may not be available at first but could
82:52 - be a feature later on I mean it was
82:55 - working like yes there's no rooms here
82:59 - right now it was working before so it's
83:02 - not working right now but you know
83:05 - that's that's how it is when it's in a
83:07 - state of development and then of course
83:10 - we have this is another one of those
83:12 - social media elements that probably
83:15 - won't be in there in terms of like
83:17 - followers and things like that and yeah
83:27 - so that's what we have so far should let
83:29 - me know if I missed anything I should
83:32 - saying the search works
83:33 - oh really cool let's see
83:43 - is it not is it just working for people
83:46 - right now do we only have limited stuff
83:54 - in there that's probably
84:04 - all right okay horseshit saying it's
84:09 - only working for people right now okay
84:11 - all right so that's the basically the
84:14 - idea behind it and I'm not indexed yet
84:17 - that's all right so that's the idea
84:20 - behind it I really just want I just want
84:26 - it to be a place where you can go to get
84:29 - inspiration and see what other people
84:34 - are doing maybe figure out projects that
84:37 - you would like to contribute to and just
84:39 - have it be a very nice fast interface
84:42 - this is all you know react based and
84:47 - let's see hard saying test yeah so we
84:54 - have the cool that's cool live search
84:55 - and that's using algo Lea which is
84:58 - pretty cool search service I like it
85:03 - it's not free but I I think it's really
85:07 - cool so anyway that's the idea
85:16 - at least that at least at first I mean
85:19 - this is gonna be totally free at some
85:21 - point I might like to add in some
85:23 - features like optional features that
85:26 - could potentially bring in some revenue
85:29 - to at least pay for servers and things
85:31 - like that because if we did get a lot of
85:34 - users I'd imagine it would get pretty
85:35 - expensive so that's that's on the
85:38 - horizon as being a possibility you know
85:42 - the other alternative maybe is trying to
85:44 - run off of donations and things like
85:47 - that so first things first is let's get
85:50 - it to a point where we can beta test it
85:52 - see if anybody is even interested if we
85:54 - even get any users and then you know
85:57 - take we'll go from there
85:59 - but the domain name will be JavaScript
86:04 - AF which will make sense for a
86:07 - javascript repository
86:09 - you know site
86:13 - yeah so anyway the the repo for this
86:17 - project for the front-end react part is
86:20 - JavaScript
86:21 - - AF and that's on my github my github
86:25 - account and then we also have the
86:28 - backend is JavaScript - AF - API so you
86:33 - can check out both of those Harshit
86:35 - mentioned before you do need some
86:38 - environment variables to get things up
86:40 - and running for the different services
86:42 - that we have so if you if you'd like to
86:46 - work on it and contribute let probably
86:50 - want to let hard [ __ ] know that you're
86:54 - interested and then see about getting
86:56 - what you need to get things up and
86:58 - running yeah and we'll definitely need
87:03 - beta testers - so even if you're not
87:05 - interested in contributing code beta
87:08 - testers are going to be important so
87:10 - I'll make sure to let everyone know when
87:11 - we're when we're at that point I think
87:14 - we're pretty close to being able to do
87:16 - some sort of you know beta like really
87:20 - limited beta you know all right okay so
87:30 - I'm gonna have to go now and get a few
87:33 - things done before my meeting and I
87:36 - should be back tomorrow I may have I got
87:40 - a double check I may have another
87:42 - presentation tomorrow it's not on my
87:43 - calendar but my the head of my
87:47 - department mentioned something about it
87:49 - so I need to figure out what what's
87:51 - going on with that so depending on what
87:54 - happens with that
87:55 - we'll see if I can stream or not and
87:58 - what time I can stream but I want to try
88:01 - to do there's many streams as I can this
88:04 - week kind of get back in the swing of
88:06 - things here Oh Michael I did not get a
88:10 - chance to check out the node CD manager
88:12 - I'm really sorry about that to be honest
88:17 - with you I keep forgetting about it and
88:18 - every time I see it in my github account
88:21 - I just look I'm not at a point where I
88:24 - can actually check it right
88:26 - boys like in the middle of doing
88:28 - something else so I will get to it I
88:31 - can't tell you when but I will try so
88:36 - apologies okay alright that's it for
88:41 - today I really need to stop talking now
88:43 - and I get ready for my next meeting I
88:46 - really appreciate everyone watching
88:49 - today and thanks for checking out this
88:52 - project and thank you to everybody who
88:54 - listened to me for a few minutes earlier
88:55 - talking about my mental health I know
88:58 - it's not very interesting for a lot of
89:00 - you but I I think it's good for me and
89:03 - it's good for other people in similar
89:04 - situations to talk about stuff like that
89:06 - so that's why I do it let's see okay see
89:13 - add a few more more comments I was just
89:15 - checking in the in the chat there but
89:18 - anyway I'm gonna try my best to be back
89:20 - tomorrow and until then have a great day
89:23 - everyone

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone welcome to live coding with Jessie today we're going to continue with our live search component and we're gonna try first to search through a lot more than we attempted to search through last week just to see what kind of performance we get when we do a search like that and you know how many entries were likely to get on you know a single search and then after we see what that looks like on the page I think we can continue on with kind of building out the UI so that's the plan for today I do have a meeting in two hours so like the stream to be about you know now somewhere between an hour and hour and a half I should give us plenty of time to get some things done and you know answer a lot of questions I hope everyone had a good weekend I I wasn't feeling well like Saturday so I actually really wanted to do a lot of coding get things done on Saturday and I ended up not so so it was it was weird and just mental health update and to help anyone else out there so I was feeling a little bit sick Saturday and my my kids were at my parents and my wife was gone so it was like I hadn't worked out in a day or two because I wasn't feeling well I was just by myself I was trying to get a lot of stuff done feeling a little bit overwhelmed and my depression and anxiety were just really bad so it maybe was a combination of you know a lot of different factors of you know this the sickness not exercising you know being lonely and you know all those factors I think may be combined so this is just something for me to watch out watch out for and maybe for for you all to watch out for if you're dealing with the same kind of kind of thing so I was kind of really pumped to be able to get all the stuff done but you know I just couldn't and so I'm gonna have to watch out for that next time and maybe come up with a different plan you know to keep myself up and and on target when I'm not really feeling well so all right so let's get onto some coding so we have a lot more people watching now I wanted to wait till we had a few more people in until I share this link here is the end rot link for this project so if you click on that link you'll be able to see the project that I'm locally working on you'll be able to see that in your browser and anytime I make changes it'll be reflected immediately in your browser so you can use dev tools on it and search around in different pages and you know you're not limited to just seeing what I happen to have on my screen at any given time I am now going to switch so that you all can see what's what's happening all right Michael said I know the feeling went through the same things this weekend yeah I am I'm feeling a little bit better now like mentally way I'm feeling I'm feeling better yeah but it was just yeah Saturday was just a weird weird day but did get some good news over the weekend so Saturday night Saturday evening at some point I found out that I was accepted to speak at the moms can code virtual summit so it's it's like a weeklong conference it's all online and there are 40 speakers 39 of the speakers are women I I'm the only man that got accepted so I'm I guess I'm pretty honored to be on that list and I feel pressure that I guess I need to do a good job to justify me being on on that list but anyway that's that's really cool I'm excited about that and that'll be sometime in April so you'll see me I'll be tweeting about that one more info comes out okay so let's all right that was a different page I was working on so I've been working on the data we have stored in WordPress trying to get things in shape because you know some of it came over in fragments we're like we have a page but then each section of the page came over as a different post type so I'm trying to consolidate those and just make sense of them michael says Congrats I think have they seen the picture of you with the beard I don't know what picture they saw good pictures this of me so yeah I mean some of my social media pictures and a lot of my videos I don't have a beard so I don't I don't know so let's go to the search page and if you want to follow along on your computer our search page is just slash search so first thing I want to do is start this Pomodoro timer so we do our first coding session and then let's go in and add post types onto our search query that we were doing so I was working on this page and let me push this I just committed my changes and now they're on github all right so now the code on github is completely up to date with what I have here locally I also I don't know how many of you remember or following along at all with one of the side projects that I'm working on that was a JavaScript AF and we had a lot of we had a lot of ideas for the site but I think we're narrowing the focus I don't want to have a site with a bunch of different features and none of them not have enough time to really perfect any of them I'd rather have a site that does one thing really well so we're focusing this site on being a place where you can find and share really cool github repos like javascript github repos so it'll just have a nice UI and whereas the site github is not focused so much on discovering new repos and being able to search for them you can do that but the focus is being able to actually update merge and maintain repositories this site is not going to have any of that it's just gonna have a really kind of nice search function and you know potentially a way to upvote repositories and try to share I'd really like to get some of these some of the things that people are working on that aren't really wellknown maybe they don't have a lot of stars to get those some more exposure to the community especially some maybe the more unique things that are happening with JavaScript I think it'd be cool to highlight so if anybody's interested in that at all you have any ideas or feedback or you'd like to contribute to that check out my github repo the project is JavaScript AF and then we also have an API hard just came in the live chat and I will mention that Harshit has done the majority of the coding for this project unfortunately I've been too busy over the last month to contribute much in the way of code so I guess I've been kind of guiding things just with with ideas and encouragement for now and Harsha's on a ton of the work so thank you to harsh it for that but I welcome anyone else to you know be involved if you want to it's it's a react project so if you're interested in reactors that and then Harsha and it could tell you more than a live chat about how we're building how he's building the backend and the API part of it if anyone's if anyone's interested all right so here's our search page where's our oops this is probably so small I apologize there we are okay so I'm on the search page so if you are following along locally or in the repository it's in the pages folder in its search j/s and we're down here at the I could shrink this up a bit and this makes more space so this is that that query that I was talking about see see right now we're not really getting that many post types so we're getting admissions pages and chapel pages so I just want to keep adding on a few more types and I'm gonna on my other screen I'm gonna check out some of the types we have so I can add them in quickly so let's go one two three four five let's try to add five types for now so we can have let's just have let's see faculty and major and I think all of these are singular if they don't work I guess then we'll find out and Department see what else most of you have academics page one more what's it gonna be if I include news it's gonna be a lot well I want to test see what we can handle so let's include news in here alright so I'm gonna save that and let's see if it works we'll just search for a really common word see if we get back a lot okay see we're getting here so we got a department admissions pages chapel page academics major okay but it looks like we didn't get anything from News which is odd I mean I'm pretty sure the word the is his in some of these news posts see did I mess up that last one and type news I may have to check to see how I put news in there in our custom plugin yeah news it should be news I didn't use yeah news was the rest yeah so I had for the rest API that's pretty weird not sure what's going on there let's see if if there's some sort of limit and so let's move news up here I don't need this type post or type page because we don't have anything in posts or pages right now anyway okay search I can't tell if the searched again or not okay we're still not getting any news it's weird I listen to see all right not really sure why that's happening with the news pages I'm gonna check the live chat here to see if if any of you said anything about that or if you're getting different results on your your local version all right I wonder alright let me know what you all think about this so clearly we're not getting everything that we could be getting here for some reason we're getting nothing from news not even if I search for news there we are finally so we did get news now this is I wonder I don't think I have any caching setup yeah all right this I wonder if it's limiting our results by that 100 maybe that's it I mean I'm not gonna count these but I figure we're probably getting a hundred if I can get a number here yep we're getting a hundred results so we're limited to that hundred which is not bad so we do all right here's here's my idea let's we're just gonna have to do either a button here that says more results or do an infinite scroll since we are limited by that 101 100 posts for a search I don't well I'll tell you what it has been a while since I checked the API documentation for WordPress it used to be and it might still be that you couldn't go over that 100 limit let's see if you can now let's just let's say 500 I yeah I don't think this will work I think 100 is like a hard limit but we'll we'll test it whoa yeah so that that must have given us an error when we tried to see and did we have area what's fun over using we don't have the the limit here it's gonna say we could see exactly I suspect we're getting this back I will copy and paste that into here so we can see what's happening we'll give it this per page 500 let's see whoops who's over here and okay we're getting something back but it's definitely not oops this isn't what I need right I made that I did that wrong no rest route and that is how we have it in here will pose now I flipped it around sorry about that okay so that's an invalid parameter we can't use 500 we can't use 200 we can't use 101 so I think it is still 100 as the limit okay yep all right so we're limited to 100 limited 100 here it's not going to be a huge problem I said we can do the search the infinite scroll type of search or have users hit a button either way and then we're going to have a lot of options for users to choose exactly what type of content they want so assuming that they're only choosing one type of content like let's say they only want faculty members to come up in their search we're fine we're now going to go over the limit especially if they're saying I only want faculty members and I want them from this specific department or I want the faculty member that has this name right there that's going to be okay the news will probably be the only post type that it really has more than hey sorry let's try to hold back a yawn so yea News definitely has more than a hundred so that will come into play if somebody searches a very common term and wants to know about news hmm okay yeah we're just gonna have to deal with that so I think I think we're okay right now yeah we're okay right now let's work on some of those let's work on some of the filters then I think before Before we jump into UI stuff kind of like wow my mind is still on that search query I think it would be a good time to do that if I switch back into like design mode it'll be harder to switch back if I want to do it so let's just put in some some test filters and see how they're gonna work so what will happen then is this whole portion of ntype news and all that that those are going to be variables just like search term is so let's see how we'll do this so let's take this and type news and copy that that's going to be the template and we're getting the search term right now from that gets saved and state I believe and why are we not okay let's see there's our input all right so we have on change get search results so let's go up til I get search results function search good ok I don't know what I was thinking so search term is passed into this function I'm not sure I want it to happen like that I think I may rather have the input be a controlled component so it actually goes up here and in state and then we don't pass anything through here we can just run it from whatever's happens to be in state at that time so let's let's do that so first thing we're gonna do we're gonna change this and we're going to say search term and we're just gonna initialize that to an empty string not equals we initialize that to an empty string so for a search term it's we're gonna say this state search term and we don't need this anymore and then down here we're gonna call fetch search term but we don't need that search value anymore and then here and put on change we're gonna put a value ID and there it's gonna get its value from this now we don't let's just say search term whoops and we're going to whoops not under props we're gonna do this and we're gonna say search term and now we're gonna say this state and what are my lines for not search CR CH T or and why can't I do that I'm pretty sure I can do that right okay let me check my time while I'm over here okay only about a minute left so let's just see if this works now well let me type in okay this state data map is not a function X as I didn't get any data oops that's weird okay I messed something up in this flow of let's see search term oh okay I'm not actually changing event default concert so it's unfocused keyword so I'm not actually setting setting state so I'm gonna set the stay here this set states and we're gonna go search term search Hey so it I have a floor no it's not working dony I think I need something else okay I would say our Christopher said it should be this state equals you did state equals all right what line was that okay yeah all right all right let me let me set my fiveminute timer so I can go back to the live chat and answer some questions then I'll come back and troubleshoot why why the values not working for that that inflated I suspect I'm just messing something up syntax why somewhere hey everybody who said hi at the beginning I forgot to say hi to you off also thanks for everyone saying congratulations for me being able to speak at the moms can code summit a noble and savage says you big rough rough looking man with giggle haha also says how he all doing I just started that 100 days thing to give me motivated to do many hours a day awesome my wife still in the hundred days of code as well so that's that's really cool I hope you hope you do all your days and learn a lot and build cool stuff all right Nikki has a crypto question so I mentioned it last week that I started doing a tutorial to build distributed apps on the ethereum blockchain using a language called solidity I think its solidity um and the tutorial is crypto zombies that I uh Sonique es is it going out to the Internet every time that zombie eat kitty function runs so true the blockchain to be specific I think so I think how that I did that lesson yeah so I think all those assuming that it's connected up to the blockchain like and not in some sandbox environment then I think all of those main functions or do go through the blockchain which I guess makes sense right because then that would that would change like important information because you would get a new zombie so it'd be a new zombie with new DNA assigned to your specific ID so I do I believe so but I'm still going this route through the tutorial I'm on lesson five now no but I'm not not at all an expert on it okay I should say and maybe show the progress on the test domain for the JavaScript raf project yeah we'll see how much time is left after I get your questions and stuff and after this next Pomodoro session and then we may do that or maybe if not today then I'm sure at some point this week we can we can show it off a bit okay Chris you're saying doesn't npm sort of do that JavaScript they have thing well I guess I mean NPM doesn't have NPM wouldn't necessarily have all the the projects there's so like not every JavaScript project on github is also an NPM unless I'm wrong and let me know if I'm wrong about that and I do want your honest opinion about the project Rea because if if you all think that it's a ridiculous idea this this github repo search thing with JavaScript dot AF let me know because I'd rather not spend a bunch of time working on something that's that nobody wants or nobody thinks will be useful so constructive criticism is definitely welcome I may try to do some live streams on my own channel where I work on that project and then that way you all can get kind of a better idea of what's going on Christopher says on your Franciscan page the nav links probably need some indication of hub or other than mouse pointer send these ones yeah let me think ok so I I'm I'm not a hundred percent sure I want to add another indication but if we were to add another indication that these are clickable what should it be so I'm up for suggestions here keep in mind I would like it to be as material design issue as possible but let me know if we're gonna have anything I would like it to be subtle I don't want a lot of crazy motion or something like that no like text getting a lot bigger stuff but I'm I am open to subtle something subtle I'll at least consider that if you all think it would it would really help okay so didn't quite get through all the questions this time we'll get to the rest of them after this next Pomodoro session alright let me reset the timer and let's figure out what I did wrong why this isn't working alright so let me let me walk through the flow of what should happen then so initially initially a search term and state to be an empty string so initially the value in our input should be search term and we should be able to get search term from here right that's why we don't need to write this state down here then on change it goes to this dot get search results so let's go up there let me see as well as psycho searches so when we go to get search results oops all right I see what the problem is I did this all in the wrong place shoot I'm gonna have to undo a lot of stuff here I'm gonna be copy this so I had we left in some there we go yeah yeah we I left in some functions that we may need at some point but right now we don't need so that's kind of that's what happened there all right so what I need to do then is go call this set state and put in a search term and set that equal to value okay and the reason we're doing that before we do this is that this is going to determine the value of that input so I don't want to debounce or check for length of that input right so otherwise I'd be able to type two characters and nothing would show up in my input all right so that's that's not what what we want so we want state to get set immediately and then we can also check here to make sure before we actually search anything that what we're debouncing so we don't search too many times and we're also not going to search for tiny strings okay so with that and that let's go down here and add this back in and let's add our value back in the value is gonna equals search term and this makes sure nothing changed I don't believe we went back so far that anything else changed yet up here okay let's say that see if it works there we are okay good so now our just to show what's what's really happening let's go into react and make this bigger maybe too big make this whole thing big there we go so here's our search term in our state and we say it says the now so if I go back we have a th there so you see every time I type this is updated so this is what we call a controlled input a controlled component we're essentially on a good way to remember this is the value of the input is controlled by state so when you type something in state is updated so the dataflow as you type state is updated and then the value of the component gets updated so as soon as state changes a rerender happens and when that rerender happens the value of this input is changed based on the value state okay so that's how the flow goes it may not seem like it makes a lot of sense or adds any benefit here when we only have one input but as we continue to add our filters on it does you'll see that it does make it easier when you have more form input so these that's been what I found is is that it's it is nicer in in those cases okay I think let's let's commit that right so I think this is enough of a feature that we can commit this before we add in some more inputs so I'm going to again status make sure of what we changed get add and then we'll do our yarn CM so this is particularly this project we have kind of a special kind of format that it takes you through so you can see this let's do a refactor yeah who do you think refactor would be appropriate oh yeah we'll say refactor and we're just gonna say we factor search input to be a controlled input okay great and this doesn't break anything and it does not affect any open issues now it's going to roll the tests once it passes we can commit this to our github repo great whoops get push origin there we are okay all right so now that we have that all sorted we can add in our filter there so this is what I was attempting to do at first and then realize that we needed to do some more work so let's as I was trying to do before grab this first one this type news just as to use as our template I guess and we're gonna let's see we're gonna create an item and States how are you gonna do this all right I'm sure we'll refactor this as we go on I'm gonna try something first we'll test and see if it works and then maybe it can be improved but so at first we're gonna do search type and this will be a string and let's just for now we're just going to put search type news in there and what do I need to grab type news and do we want the end there all the time we went up we want the end to be here okay so search site news and forget like okay and then we're going to let's take all of this get rid of it for now even this let's take all of this get rid of it for now and throw it over here just kind of in our scrap for the file and because we'll refer to that a little bit later but what we want to do back here where we took all this stuff out is we want to put in a class we could do we'll just concatenate these two the state search type right why is this not working you're why is he giving me an error this state search type as we okay okay so it does work I don't I don't know what was up with that error I guess it didn't like that space in there but you can see we've I don't know how if it's easy to see this down at the bottom here but we have our search did exactly we have the search term though and then the type equals news so now if we want to change what we're searching for all we have to do is change this in state this search type so what we can do now is add our inputs that are going to change what we're searching and each one of those will change this value here so here's what I'm thinking it'll be check boxes because we don't want to limit users to only search one thing at a time that would be I could see that as being annoying that a user picked the wrong category they're not sure exactly what they want and they have to go through like four different categories searching for the same thing in each category that's that's annoying what if they say well I think it might be in one of these four categories so I'm gonna search for all four of these categories at once so that's why I like the idea of checkboxes as opposed to radio buttons so we will have checkboxes for each of the search items if you've ever been to amazon.com you notice that on their search they go mostly with the check boxes so we're gonna go with something like that and so each check box that's checked is going to update what is in search type now we're going to do this this is what I was pausing to think about before and I said I would just put it off the best way to not only add to this string but also remove items as well series oh how about this what if instead of just having search type to search tight we have we had can we can we do this search type is let's go majors do we have majored yet this would be insight major faculty is gonna give us okay so you get what I'm doing here okay and then what we would do is map so we would look through this so every time the search happens you would loop through this and then add these together so essentially a search happens everything's cleared then gets added again and that's on search or that happens on click of a checkbox so we just go through and and add those in yeah okay let me check the the live chat because I think some of you are commenting on this as well oh okay Alexander's saying it's hard to read the console you know what I I had moved my where my my video shows up when I made that so Friday afternoon I made a I think it was Friday afternoon maybe Thursday anyway I made a video about installing node and and get and cloning a repo to your local machine and getting it up and running kind of just like a beginner's basics video and I posted that on my channel so if you're new to get and github check that out maybe it might it may be helpful for you but anyway what I was doing in that video made more sense for me to have my thing over here and I forgot to move it back thank you for bringing that up though I apologize if this has been covering things up the whole time john hanson saying it could be an array of objects michael says is there a way to group checkboxes in a frame and then build a search query of the check boxes in the frame i know access could do it john says you could also make those default value as false and true on checkbox okay all right let's go let me let me test things out which is these three will make some check boxes and then see if the concept itself is just working at all and then we can refactor after that l exam dove saying this state search type as an array okay yeah actually we could do it and I think somebody else mentioned it as well as well what about an array of objects yeah let's do an array of objects that makes sense let's see if it'll let me do this yes but we don't need this to be defined with you talking about oops all right they don't like that Alexander says who you would separate the URL creation from the logic okay we need some checkboxes now should we check material UI yeah whoops let's check this component selects it's any checkboxes click the wrong thing wait there's got to be checkboxes checkbox yeah I'm just missing it in here Oh selection controls that's what it was under control okay let's see this one I guess we can grab all of this and we'll paste it for now we'll just put it right below I know we have this in a form tag but for now I'm going to keep it separate we need form control form label while we need a lot let's just copy and paste okay so we're gonna have to change the values of course just to make sure no the sandals change is not a function alright let's let's bring in the handle change function as well I miss that oh you know what I forgot we already were pulling in some filter stuff it's alright just to get this working for now no change alright cool so here's our our inputs and I wanted to use the material UI ones instead of just throwing in an input like we did here because you know we see we have styling built in so I'll probably adjust the Styles a bit like maybe add a little less space between these but this is basically what we want I don't have that much time left no not enough time left so we need just a price all right that's that's not what we brought in all right I'm at a time for this one we're gonna have to save this I suppose for tomorrow normally I would try to get this done but since I have a meeting coming up I can't I can't go to too much longer so the plan then is and I may just hold off and do this in the next stream we'll see but the plan is just to connect these so that when you check it it does actually change something in state and then once someone were would search or click it takes everything in States these strings and it makes one large string and that's what gets inserted into here so let's you know let's change this now well I'm thinking about it so we need get rid of this and make that blank and then instead of search type this needs to be checkboxes there we go okay so now we can still say where do you search type in here this makes sense now we're saying these are the check box values yeah this may be over complicated to do it like this it's all separate objects so anyway that's that's basically what's going to happen if that works then I'll just add all the possible combinations as check boxes that we want here and and then we need to make clean up the UI a bit so on a large screen you know we could probably display all the options and it wouldn't be an issue on mobile we're gonna have to come up with some other way to display all the options probably some sort of toggle that would display them and then hide them okay so let me go back to our left off in the live chat let me get a drink first so I'm going to go back to where I left off I'm gonna answer as many questions as I can before my meeting I think I should be able to get all the questions and if you have any more questions please put them in the live chat now feel free also to ask me questions in the comments of this video or to send me a question on Twitter or Instagram Facebook email whatever else you can think of I can't always get back to you right away but I do try to eventually get back to everyone that asked me a question see Guerlain says how do I gain abilities like you just practice so I take some like if you haven't already done it go through some of the free chord free code camp challenges you can check out some of the free Udacity free or paid Udacity courses just take advantage of a lot of the online resources that are out there to help you learn more about JavaScript HTML and CSS if you're interested in design I recommend reading through the Google material design documentation if you're not a fan of material design you know check out apple's design stuff I assume Microsoft has something similar for their their style so just just to give you an idea of you know all the thought and and that goes into you know designing a a nice looking and useful user interface and then just practice this keep building things if you can get paid to build that's even better but either way just keep building and I mean that's that's really how it's done there's no substitute just for experience and in practicing so there's a little bit every day if you can is is great sandé says hey do you play csgo I do not play csgo so I'm not currently the only thing that I've been playing and I don't really I don't play every day as Zelda breadth of the wild for Nintendo switch so occasionally I will play that and some usually like if I'm hang out in the morning on exercise bike sometimes I'll play if divi Anshu says hi I just joined what did I miss we were so we tested out some of the limits on the search in terms of how many things we could search for at once and we can search for a hundred things at once we can't go past the hundred thing limit we can search for a bunch of different types of content all at once but we're still limited by that hundred thing limit we made an input into a controlled input so just using state as the value and then making sure we update state every time we change that input and then we add it in some check boxes and those will eventually be used to determine exactly what types of content we will be searching for John said congrats on the talk Thanks thank you I appreciate it siphon siphon X says are you reading this I am now that's your if you're still here I should say even you don't know how large that codebase is gone I'm assuming you're talking about the JavaScript AF yeah I'm sure I I don't know how large the code pieces because I haven't been through it all so in that after saying that hard [ __ ] I mean do you in your opinion do you think it was a good call to say we're just going to focus on one thing instead of trying to do a lot of different things just in terms of being able to manage the repository will that help you cutting things down Aniki says kind of off topic but phantom Jas is having drama and is being retired luckily it kind of got replaced by puppeteer while ago yes yes so I don't know if if anyone knows about this but so phantom Jas was open source project there's just not enough people maintaining it and so they are retiring it I believe they said that it could be revived at a later date but that's not really guaranteed they would need more people to get involved with the project so so I guess I mean when things like this happen it's good to remember these open source projects only exist because people donate their time to help keeping them alive so if you have the ability and the time to keep them alive please please do that and contribute to the projects maybe if if you don't have the time or the ability to contribute maybe consider can tributing money to help keep these projects alive so either way that can be very helpful John says anyone interested in the upcoming changes in react should watch the video sneak peek beyond react 16 on the react JSL work blog a sync rendering time slicing suspense and many other new things yes definitely give that a watch so ya go to react jest or go to the blog check out the video the video is embedded right there in the blog I didn't watch the entire video I watched at least half of it when it came out last week very impressive very exciting so I'm not gonna try to explain it because I'm sure I'll mess it up I only watched it once last week and only halfway through so maybe if I go through the video more and understand it a little better maybe we'll talk about it on the stream but it was cool like when I got to the point in the video when I was really starting to think about okay how could I use this on my projects then it's it started to get exciting it was cool you know thinking about things I've done in past projects that were kind of a pain and in thinking wow if I had this back then it would have been so much better really really cool cool stuff Fernando says hi Jesse I am from Argentina welcome thank you for watching John Ensign says and this is about the new reax there's no more need for debounce yeah you're right I saw that part so there's something that may be coming in react so all these things in reactor like not guaranteed yet none of them are finished so they could change but like there was a thing in there that maybe it would make debounce obsolete so we're using it in this project right now if you just talked about it earlier in the in the stream we saw that line where we're debouncing so we wouldn't need to do that okay hard sink so that show the site if time allows alright let me get through these last few things in the live chat horseshit and check the time Michael says I've hit a brick wall with my free code camp Simon I'm not great at frontend but good at logic I've been fighting a way to make it look good but it breaks my logic is it better to look bad but I'm nice logic or look nice and have spaghetti code on the backend it depends on who's looking at it right from from a user's perspective I guess as long as it works they would prefer that it does look nice and they don't care what the code looks like at all they probably never think about it but if you are going to be showing this to death so if it's going to be on your github repo then you probably do want your code to look nice if it's something you're going to go back to and have to maintain you don't want spaghetti code either so that's interesting that the look of it is breaking the logic I said hmm Michael do you have that on get that project on github and would you mind if I just took a look at it at some point I can't I don't have a lot of time so I can't guarantee I'd be able to do anything but if I get a chance I'd like to at least like just check it out so let me know chef in says hello I'm from Bangladesh hi welcome thanks for watching Chris says that's great advice oh thanks thanks Michael says no no no it was that a no no no to be looking at it alright it's cool it's cool if you don't wanted me to see it I understand but uh alright so I've gotten through everything the live set so I guess I'll have a look yeah let's let's have a look at the the project here so hard [ __ ] Harshit you want me to show the project on the test URL are you cool with people knowing the test URL right now I'm gonna open it on my other screen and wait for an answer here all right some still I'm waiting for response hopefully our she heard me I just want to be sure that the test URL can handle traffic and that it's okay for people to know about it okay there you go all the old stuff was loading I had to refresh it okay cool so let me let me pull this over and I'm just gonna spend just a few minutes on this because I will have to go to my meeting soon but here's a sneak preview of what Harshit has been working on in doing pretty much all the coding for especially all the backend stuff and I've been just somewhat involved and to be honest but this is just a little taste we're not even in beta yet like we'd like to have a beta at some point so very much open to suggestions the idea is you could go here to discover new repositories you could certainly have different criteria for what you would want to how you want to filter these and how do you want to sort them and there will be some sort of way to let's say upvote different repositories so I would like it I'm not gonna say right away that I'm going to exclude the big repositories but I would like to make it so that the big repositories are not always on the top right you know we you can always see like react has it's honest you know reacts up at the top like the the big stuff from big companies are usually at at the top of like the most starred repositories so I everybody already knows about those what I want to highlight are some of the smaller ones so I'm hoping that's what we'll do we'll just have to kind of as we go through beta testing and things we just have to kind of adjust how we're pulling these in to make sure that that happens so here's some of the other things like we have a feed our sugar we are we not doing the feed at first I think that's what what's happening so I think I think we're not gonna have the feed so there was some social media components that we're gonna hold off we're most likely I where either gonna split it into another project or just hold off on them and maybe think about adding them back in at some point but for now I think we're better off focusing on one thing getting that ready so we can actually get it released and doing that one thing well we also had a spot where we were gonna allow people to post jobs so this is one of the other things that may be added on as a feature at some point obviously we're going to have a search which this one currently is searching for people and repositories so for sure we're gonna have a repository search I'll have to check with Harshit on whether the people search adds a lot more complexity or not if it doesn't then we may keep that if you know if not it might just be repositories at first the messaging thing that's another thing that Merriman may not be available at first but could be a feature later on I mean it was working like yes there's no rooms here right now it was working before so it's not working right now but you know that's that's how it is when it's in a state of development and then of course we have this is another one of those social media elements that probably won't be in there in terms of like followers and things like that and yeah so that's what we have so far should let me know if I missed anything I should saying the search works oh really cool let's see is it not is it just working for people right now do we only have limited stuff in there that's probably all right okay horseshit saying it's only working for people right now okay all right so that's the basically the idea behind it and I'm not indexed yet that's all right so that's the idea behind it I really just want I just want it to be a place where you can go to get inspiration and see what other people are doing maybe figure out projects that you would like to contribute to and just have it be a very nice fast interface this is all you know react based and let's see hard saying test yeah so we have the cool that's cool live search and that's using algo Lea which is pretty cool search service I like it it's not free but I I think it's really cool so anyway that's the idea at least that at least at first I mean this is gonna be totally free at some point I might like to add in some features like optional features that could potentially bring in some revenue to at least pay for servers and things like that because if we did get a lot of users I'd imagine it would get pretty expensive so that's that's on the horizon as being a possibility you know the other alternative maybe is trying to run off of donations and things like that so first things first is let's get it to a point where we can beta test it see if anybody is even interested if we even get any users and then you know take we'll go from there but the domain name will be JavaScript AF which will make sense for a javascript repository you know site yeah so anyway the the repo for this project for the frontend react part is JavaScript AF and that's on my github my github account and then we also have the backend is JavaScript AF API so you can check out both of those Harshit mentioned before you do need some environment variables to get things up and running for the different services that we have so if you if you'd like to work on it and contribute let probably want to let hard [ __ ] know that you're interested and then see about getting what you need to get things up and running yeah and we'll definitely need beta testers so even if you're not interested in contributing code beta testers are going to be important so I'll make sure to let everyone know when we're when we're at that point I think we're pretty close to being able to do some sort of you know beta like really limited beta you know all right okay so I'm gonna have to go now and get a few things done before my meeting and I should be back tomorrow I may have I got a double check I may have another presentation tomorrow it's not on my calendar but my the head of my department mentioned something about it so I need to figure out what what's going on with that so depending on what happens with that we'll see if I can stream or not and what time I can stream but I want to try to do there's many streams as I can this week kind of get back in the swing of things here Oh Michael I did not get a chance to check out the node CD manager I'm really sorry about that to be honest with you I keep forgetting about it and every time I see it in my github account I just look I'm not at a point where I can actually check it right boys like in the middle of doing something else so I will get to it I can't tell you when but I will try so apologies okay alright that's it for today I really need to stop talking now and I get ready for my next meeting I really appreciate everyone watching today and thanks for checking out this project and thank you to everybody who listened to me for a few minutes earlier talking about my mental health I know it's not very interesting for a lot of you but I I think it's good for me and it's good for other people in similar situations to talk about stuff like that so that's why I do it let's see okay see add a few more more comments I was just checking in the in the chat there but anyway I'm gonna try my best to be back tomorrow and until then have a great day everyone
