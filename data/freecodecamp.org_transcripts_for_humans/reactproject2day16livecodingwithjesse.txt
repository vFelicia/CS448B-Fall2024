With timestamps:

00:04 - hey everybody it's Jessie and today
00:09 - we're going to keep working on this
00:14 - section so I can get on the screen all
00:18 - right so I figure we'll finish up this
00:22 - section because we're almost there
00:26 - so it's kind of didn't want to move on
00:28 - to anything different and as you can see
00:33 - I've got all the correct logos in here
00:36 - now so I actually went back and looked
00:45 - at my original code for this and luckily
00:51 - when I first did this this is the format
00:53 - that I put all the data for the logos in
00:58 - I'm I'm not even really sure why I did
01:02 - it like this because it was basically
01:05 - like static a static page but I think I
01:09 - was using handlebars for templating and
01:12 - I just I did it like this obviously at
01:17 - the time I didn't use Const because I
01:18 - had no idea what that was whenever I did
01:20 - this but and I you know I didn't do it
01:25 - exactly like this but basically I had a
01:27 - separate logos DOJ's file and it had
01:32 - this data at the top and then passed it
01:36 - into a handlebars template which is
01:38 - awesome because I was really afraid I
01:41 - was going to have to actually type out
01:43 - this data
01:44 - I had forgotten until about an hour ago
01:47 - that I did it like this so I just copied
01:51 - and pasted this over and in state I why
01:57 - imported logos and instan state for data
02:03 - and now it's logos so down here I'm
02:08 - putting in I had that you know prefix
02:11 - this with the actual paths and some
02:13 - relative pass here and then I just add
02:16 - the relative path on to the end and
02:20 - everything's working so that was really
02:25 - cool that was that was definitely a
02:27 - time-saver so actually even for now I
02:31 - don't have to do anything I can leave
02:33 - these logos where they are I would
02:35 - prefer to house them somewhere else just
02:39 - so that I have better I guess control
02:42 - over them because I can't directly the
02:47 - directory that they're these are and now
02:50 - that this is referencing I don't have
02:52 - any access to that so what I had to do
02:58 - initially was send all these files like
03:01 - I literally had to email these files did
03:06 - I email him it's possible that I was
03:09 - given access to some sort of network
03:10 - drive but in any case someone in the IT
03:13 - department had to copy and paste
03:16 - everything over because I wasn't allowed
03:18 - to have access to it and I still don't
03:20 - have access so I'd rather have have
03:26 - these somewhere else so off the figure
03:28 - out where the best place to house these
03:30 - are and maybe you can let me know what
03:33 - you think I'm not really I mean
03:37 - obviously we're gonna have some sort of
03:38 - server for this but all right I don't
03:44 - know whose number that is sorry my
03:45 - phone's ringing I don't know the number
03:47 - so I'm not gonna answer usually if I
03:49 - don't know the number there's somebody
03:50 - trying to sell me something where was I
04:00 - unless my train of thought oh okay so
04:03 - obviously we're gonna have some sort of
04:05 - node server to run this but I don't
04:09 - really know should i house the files on
04:11 - that same server or is there a better
04:13 - place that I could house the files I'm
04:16 - thinking like maybe there's some sort of
04:17 - out-of-the-box thing that I haven't done
04:20 - before that might be cool to try so let
04:23 - me know if you know of anything like
04:25 - that and and then we'll see what like I
04:29 - said we don't have to figure that out
04:31 - really at all for a while I think I am
04:37 - just a little bit nervous since I don't
04:38 - have access to that folder I can't if
04:42 - something were to happen
04:44 - I'd rather get the files out of there
04:45 - and at least backed up somewhere else if
04:47 - something were to happen I'm pretty sure
04:49 - I have all these backed up at the very
04:52 - least on on my computer possibly in a
04:56 - cloud drive somewhere but I would still
05:01 - feel better if it's in a different spot
05:05 - so that's pretty much all I've done I
05:09 - had a few pull requests I think they're
05:12 - all pretty minor I had some from Kevin
05:15 - one from Sebastian kind of editing some
05:22 - environment variables so that we don't
05:25 - when you're testing it doesn't send a
05:27 - lot of projects to rike when when
05:33 - testing the service request form and yes
05:38 - you can check out I think it was like 37
05:40 - 38 and 39 with the pool request numbers
05:43 - if you want to check those out and I
05:50 - think that's all it's Oh big change
05:54 - I forgot that I changed this so I
05:56 - changed the layout a bit in terms of how
06:00 - the logos are displayed so yesterday we
06:03 - just had the logos and not in cards I
06:06 - wanted to see what it would look like if
06:08 - I put them in cards obviously I would
06:11 - want to space this out a bit I mean it
06:13 - there needs to be
06:14 - some space between these but other than
06:17 - that my reasoning for wanting to put
06:19 - them in cards were that currently these
06:23 - all have white backgrounds possibly some
06:28 - have transparent backgrounds but some of
06:30 - them definitely have white backgrounds I
06:32 - don't think all of them might I could do
06:35 - transparent and our background here is
06:41 - that kind of grey color but in the live
06:44 - site is white so it works that it looks
06:48 - like all the logos are just the logos
06:50 - but when the logos are up against the
06:53 - gray you can see the white outline which
06:56 - I didn't think looked very good so I
06:58 - thought okay well if they're gonna look
07:00 - like there's a square of white around
07:03 - them anyway or a rectangle why not make
07:06 - it a card the other thing that I needed
07:09 - was I needed a way to be able to click
07:13 - either you know JPEG or PSD so I'll show
07:22 - you what it looks like right now so
07:25 - here's the effect that I have right now
07:27 - when you hover these two little kind of
07:33 - buttons come up one says web one says
07:36 - print we went back and forth initially
07:38 - as to what we should call this like
07:40 - would people understand what a JPEG is
07:42 - what a PSD is and what they should use
07:44 - them for so we ended up going with web
07:46 - and print because generally that's what
07:49 - people would end up using them for I
07:51 - think I've clicked tracking on all these
07:54 - so I may be able to find out are people
07:57 - actually clicking these and which one
07:59 - they're they're really clicking more do
08:00 - we really need both but for now I I kind
08:06 - of I didn't really want to do the same
08:09 - effect and you all can let me know how
08:11 - you think this looks I'm just not I'm
08:15 - not sure I'm not sure that I like it
08:19 - just seems it seems like there's a lot
08:20 - going on I think maybe I've gotten to
08:25 - like
08:27 - more simplistic design since I've done
08:31 - this kind of less motion so I'm not
08:36 - really I don't really like that when you
08:38 - hover the not only does the logo appear
08:42 - you know to grow but then you also have
08:47 - these and then there's even a hover
08:49 - effect on these so I just I'm not really
08:54 - sure what I want to do with it right now
08:56 - I've just been kind of looking at it a
08:59 - lot and trying to visualize what it
09:01 - could be so I don't want to change it
09:04 - dramatically because I want users to
09:08 - still be familiar with what they're used
09:10 - to so we need do something with that we
09:14 - also need to do something with with
09:19 - these here not really sure that how they
09:25 - currently are I don't really know that I
09:27 - like that but I'm I'm not exactly sure
09:30 - what I want to do with that either
09:31 - so I'm open to your ideas
09:34 - sometimes when I get to this point and I
09:38 - want to make a change but I'm not sure I
09:40 - like design inspiration elsewhere so
09:46 - I'll go through usually like other sites
09:50 - that use material design and see how
09:53 - they've handled similar use cases and
09:56 - usually I can get some inspiration I I
09:59 - really don't like to let's say copy
10:02 - anybody's design exactly because I don't
10:07 - know there's just something in me that
10:08 - wants to do it once that my own kind of
10:11 - spin on it but I do like to see how it's
10:14 - how it's handled so maybe I'll do some
10:19 - of that we'll see but there are a few
10:21 - things that definitely need need worked
10:24 - on now so we need to connect the data to
10:29 - these buttons for the links to be able
10:30 - to work I'd like to be able to add the
10:35 - correct alt text titles to these images
10:41 - definitely add some space between these
10:44 - cars still not sure if we'll keep the
10:46 - cards on or not and possibly even some
10:51 - padding but I don't like how that is
10:54 - touching the sides there most of the
10:57 - other logos are okay but some of them
10:59 - some of them still touch all right so
11:02 - that's that's basically an overview of
11:04 - the the problems that we're gonna try to
11:06 - to solve today and we'll see how far we
11:11 - get and and what we come up with I just
11:14 - pushed to the github repo and let me
11:18 - check this time because yesterday I
11:23 - thought I pushed and then I had some
11:24 - errors and so I went like for an hour
11:28 - without realizing that the code wasn't
11:30 - updated but in fact it was updated and
11:33 - it didn't work so the latest version of
11:36 - the code is in the master branch in the
11:40 - git repo for this project the links in
11:42 - the description so you all can check
11:44 - that out I'm gonna check the live chat
11:48 - before I start the Pomodoro timer just
11:50 - to see what y'all think I know I asked
11:52 - several questions at the beginning so
11:55 - and I haven't checked or any answers yet
11:56 - so we're gonna do that also I guess a
12:03 - for anybody's no I I haven't done like
12:06 - the the normal what's this show about I
12:09 - think for a while so for anybody who's
12:11 - new that's watching I'm a front-end
12:13 - developer and this is me doing my
12:15 - everyday work so it's not rehearsed I'm
12:18 - gonna make mistakes we're gonna try to
12:20 - work through them it's not exactly a
12:22 - tutorial although I try my best to
12:24 - explain what I'm doing and at various
12:28 - levels even even some basic things
12:29 - because we have people of all skill
12:31 - levels in here feel free to ask any
12:33 - questions
12:34 - I'll take breaks periodically to answer
12:36 - questions and then at the end I'll try
12:38 - to answer every question that I had
12:40 - missed throughout the show let's see
12:43 - there's a second stream on Instagram
12:46 - that's a view of me as I'm coding and my
12:50 - office so you can check
12:53 - if you want to it's kind of just more
12:55 - like a novelty thing because obviously
12:57 - the main thing is the code and not not
13:00 - really my face but occasionally people
13:03 - check in and I guess maybe they're
13:06 - curious to see what would I look like
13:08 - what my office looks like and if you
13:12 - happen to be watching this on Instagram
13:14 - of the recording check out the free code
13:16 - camp YouTube channel and you get a
13:18 - better idea of what I'm doing because
13:19 - you'll be able to see the code in my
13:21 - screen okay so enough enough
13:25 - introduction let's check out would you
13:28 - all have to say about this project and
13:31 - some of the problems that I want to say
13:33 - problems so some some of the use cases
13:35 - and issues we're gonna we're going to
13:37 - deal with so okay so I did I had a
13:44 - comment a while before the stream
13:46 - started so I'm not even sure if so this
13:49 - is from mine blocks coder not sure if
13:52 - you're still watching but mine blocks
13:54 - coder said maybe you should try doing
13:56 - streams earlier I've thought about doing
14:00 - different times occasionally I do
14:01 - streams at different times in fact this
14:04 - week I've done I varied the times I
14:06 - think last week I did an early stream
14:09 - which it would have been in the morning
14:11 - for my time zone but I'm certainly open
14:16 - to changing the time that I do these
14:18 - this time in the afternoon seems to be a
14:22 - good time to where I can be most
14:24 - consistent I do have some meetings that
14:26 - I always have let's say like in the
14:28 - morning so if I were to change it to a
14:32 - different time earlier I probably
14:34 - couldn't be consistent every day with
14:36 - that time but I'm open to it
14:39 - just let me know let me know what you
14:41 - think let me know in the live chat but
14:43 - it might actually be more helpful to put
14:45 - a comment to this video and then that
14:48 - way I'll be able to see it you later on
14:51 - so especially for the people who are
14:53 - gonna watch the recording obviously the
14:56 - live stream is not a good time for you
14:58 - so let me know when a good time would be
15:00 - preferably if you could figure out when
15:03 - that time would be in Eastern time that
15:04 - would be great but otherwise if you
15:06 - don't want to do
15:06 - that just let me know what timezone
15:08 - urine as well so I could figure out what
15:09 - time that would be for me and I'm
15:13 - definitely open to trying that I think
15:15 - it would be cool to let other people be
15:18 - able to participate in the live stream
15:21 - but otherwise I'm gonna try to stick
15:24 - with this time unless unless I I find
15:28 - out that there's a significant number of
15:30 - people who would rather have it at a
15:31 - different time
15:33 - cool Mayank says great work dude thank
15:38 - you thank you I appreciate that thanks
15:41 - for watching Abhishek's is nicely done
15:44 - thanks to you thanks you all are very
15:47 - very kind today to start out with so hey
15:51 - everyone a few people were saying hi
15:55 - okay so I did ask a question about where
15:58 - to store these images Patrick says maybe
16:01 - AWS s3 Rohan says let's not go for the
16:05 - nucular off so maybe that would be
16:08 - overkill for what we need but actually I
16:10 - do these small projects and sometimes I
16:14 - do think that the way I do some of them
16:17 - might be overkill for that particular
16:19 - project but but keep in mind what I'm
16:23 - trying to do with these small projects
16:25 - is not only fulfill all of the
16:27 - requirements for that particular project
16:28 - but prepare for larger projects so the
16:31 - main website for my university with the
16:33 - Franciscan ddu knees redone I think it's
16:37 - badly in need of being redone because
16:39 - the site is very very slow and that not
16:43 - to mention design outdated you know
16:45 - there's there's a lot of things that
16:47 - need updated but the number one thing
16:48 - for me is nobody's going to stick around
16:50 - even see what it looks like because the
16:52 - load times are insane and I've gotten
16:55 - the load times down about as far as I
16:57 - think I can given the current system so
17:01 - all of these small projects I want to
17:05 - test out something that I know I'll
17:07 - probably need with a larger project so
17:09 - while it might not be necessary for a
17:12 - smaller project in in the bigger picture
17:15 - of what I'm trying to do as a
17:18 - whole I need that test I need to be able
17:22 - to prove it I'd like to be able to say
17:24 - to my boss and the people higher up who
17:27 - are gonna have to approve things all the
17:30 - I'd like to be able to either they have
17:31 - my plan to say hey all these things that
17:32 - I'm saying that I can do I've done them
17:34 - here with this site that site that site
17:36 - so they can actually go and see it and
17:38 - see that it works and that I've tested
17:40 - it because it is gonna sound a bit crazy
17:42 - when I propose all this it's going to be
17:46 - much different than their current set up
17:48 - which you know the set up is just a
17:49 - traditional dotnet based content
17:53 - management system hosted on Windows
17:57 - servers here on campus in our IT
17:59 - department a very old-school set up so
18:03 - what I'm proposing just you know briefly
18:07 - is a react site pulling data from
18:10 - content management system
18:12 - maybe WordPress but then having just
18:17 - heavy caching to handle the load and
18:20 - load balance across I don't know maybe
18:24 - like half a dozen digital ocean droplets
18:28 - to handle to where like copies of all
18:32 - the react apps will be potentially
18:37 - drawing data from multiple WordPress
18:39 - installs from different sites so that
18:43 - concept is really foreign I think to to
18:47 - a lot of people so it would be great to
18:50 - be able to say like hey we've done it so
18:53 - if you notice in the last project we did
18:55 - the load balancing right we pulled in
18:57 - data from WordPress so anyway hopefully
19:00 - you understand what I'm saying because I
19:02 - have had people ask definitely more than
19:05 - once like why are you doing it like this
19:07 - do you really need to do that and that's
19:09 - really why I mean I do want to make
19:11 - really good sites so it's cool to try to
19:14 - use the latest thing even if I you know
19:17 - don't have to but I'm trying to prove by
19:22 - actually doing these things that my plan
19:26 - will work for the main site so anyway
19:29 - sorry that was a long time spent
19:31 - on what wasn't even really a question
19:34 - from you just they it just popped into
19:36 - my head but it does it it is an answer
19:39 - to questions I've received previously
19:42 - about the same topic okay david says
19:49 - what about storing them in manga or
19:51 - something yeah I'm thinking about that
19:52 - I'm I'm actually considering some sort
19:55 - of database they said don't really know
19:59 - if it's necessary but once again like
20:01 - it's not it's not just about what's
20:04 - necessary for the project it's about
20:05 - what what should I be testing and
20:07 - learning to prepare for other projects
20:10 - that I know I'll need to do Sebastian
20:14 - said card style looks good
20:16 - the hovering button kind of overkill
20:19 - yeah okay Sebastian says the card style
20:26 - so I'd asked what you all think about
20:28 - this so he said sir card style goes
20:31 - straight to the point you see the image
20:33 - choose the format really simple okay
20:36 - yeah that's kind of what I thought you
20:38 - you know the hover you have to actually
20:43 - hover over the image see it's not even
20:44 - apparent what you're supposed to do with
20:46 - these images you would think somebody
20:48 - would try to click but I've I've noticed
20:50 - that people who aren't really that
20:54 - familiar with technology they don't use
20:56 - it a lot they're not really inclined to
20:58 - move around and click there their
20:59 - mindset is well like if I don't move or
21:01 - click anything I won't mess it up
21:03 - which is kind of weird because obviously
21:06 - I'm sure all of us
21:08 - when we go into a website we're like I'm
21:10 - clicking and hovering everything like I
21:12 - want to see how this thing works that's
21:15 - because that's what we do you know but I
21:19 - can't rely on that you know other people
21:22 - don't always work like that so I agree
21:24 - Sebastian I think it would be better to
21:26 - have it more straightforward like this
21:30 - but still open I still don't I just
21:34 - don't love how this looks so I'm trying
21:38 - to think of a way to make it look a bit
21:39 - better I mean maybe it'll look better
21:41 - when I put in the proper
21:44 - you know spacing here we'll see well
21:48 - we'll mess around with it today and see
21:50 - what it looks like
21:55 - Rohan said watching the Instagram stream
21:58 - where is the mic you mean like like
22:05 - we're actually like you can't see the
22:07 - mic in the image or is the mic messed up
22:10 - on the Instagram stream so you can't
22:11 - hear my voice so while I'm waiting for
22:20 - the delay and the answer to that
22:23 - I'll get do another take another
22:26 - question so code BCC says what's a good
22:31 - resource to learn front-end development
22:33 - I'm experienced on the backend wanting
22:35 - to get into front-end and Sebastian says
22:38 - for basics check free code camp and then
22:41 - Udacity and learn code Academy yeah I
22:45 - definitely agree those are great
22:47 - resources that'll that'll get you on the
22:52 - right path for sure alright David said
22:58 - watching from Ireland so don't make it
23:00 - too early yeah that's the thing if I
23:02 - change the time it'll work better for
23:04 - some people but worse for others there's
23:06 - not really any way around it you know we
23:07 - have people from from all over the world
23:09 - so I you know I don't know maybe maybe I
23:15 - can try to vary so that I don't I don't
23:19 - know some days a week I'll do it in the
23:21 - afternoon some days in the morning and
23:22 - then I don't know I'll think about it
23:27 - okay Patrick must have visited the main
23:31 - site franciscans edu and he says it's
23:34 - brutally slow yes yes it is Rohan says I
23:42 - would suggest a common static content
23:45 - CDN or just a different droplet for all
23:47 - sites going forward I like that idea I
23:50 - like that we had thought about that
23:52 - before for different projects and yeah
23:56 - that would
23:57 - really useful rowan says clicking and
24:03 - hovering I have dev tools open all the
24:04 - time I didn't want to I didn't want to
24:06 - go that far with it but I'm the same way
24:11 - you know I have my my browser extension
24:17 - here right so it tells me what
24:21 - everything's built from all the time so
24:23 - I'm always looking at this and then also
24:25 - going to dev tools if I see something
24:27 - odd like you know or just I just want to
24:30 - know how did they do that
24:31 - so yeah I'm right with you there oh okay
24:37 - so we're gonna ask the mic for YouTube
24:39 - recording it's in there actually yeah
24:43 - it's hard to get the mic and me in the
24:46 - recording at the same time so yeah I
24:50 - just tried it I'm kind of like my face
24:55 - is way off to the side and you can't
24:58 - really see all of it so anyway it's a
25:03 - nod I have to have it at a far enough
25:06 - away from the mic so that it doesn't
25:08 - cause interference but then it also
25:10 - makes it so that basically the angle of
25:14 - it is coming like from where I have the
25:18 - live chat the screen that I have the
25:20 - live chat on so when I'm looking at the
25:22 - live chat it's a decent angle because
25:24 - I'm looking pretty much right at the the
25:29 - camera for on my phone but when I look
25:34 - at the code I'm I'm turned completely
25:37 - you know kind of sideways you get a side
25:39 - profile of me but not really anything I
25:43 - can do about it I'd rather have the mic
25:45 - be in the central location so everyone
25:48 - can hear because as I said I mean I
25:50 - consider the the Instagram just kind of
25:54 - a secondary novelty thing oh cool Rowan
26:00 - says the audio on YouTube is very
26:01 - consistent even though you move a lot
26:03 - awesome
26:03 - yeah the mic is basically like as in the
26:06 - middle as I can get it without blocking
26:07 - a screen so
26:10 - so far it's been working out well
26:13 - actually it was a really cheap mic I got
26:16 - it like on Amazon for it was a good deal
26:18 - I want to say it was like less than $15
26:20 - or something but it got good reviews so
26:24 - I thought it was worth a shot
26:32 - okay let's get to some code so Gavin did
26:37 - ask did he complete the logo screen and
26:39 - the last live think so I didn't exactly
26:41 - complete it I we got we got to the point
26:49 - where we had some of this up here but we
26:53 - just had some like test testing so it
26:58 - wasn't these this content of these names
27:01 - and we had some like just one image in
27:05 - here to test but it actually wasn't even
27:07 - loading so we added a little broken
27:10 - image icon but it was enough to test
27:11 - that they were getting on the page and
27:15 - then when we clicked these up here it
27:16 - did it changed since then I put I pulled
27:23 - in data for all the images so that we
27:25 - could get all the the actual images that
27:27 - are gonna be on this once it's live and
27:30 - I put it in some cards and then I also
27:32 - put in the proper name so in terms of
27:35 - code you can see I just put these in up
27:39 - here it's not really a super long list
27:41 - so I'm kind of okay with it being here
27:43 - but I could see like it might make sense
27:47 - to move this somewhere else as well I
27:51 - could I could move it over here to this
27:52 - file and export that as well
27:55 - so we'll see I will if this starts to
27:58 - get long right now it's so short it just
28:00 - doesn't bother me if it starts to get
28:02 - longer maybe we'll move it maybe you
28:06 - know just to keep things clean but for
28:08 - now this is here and then all the data
28:10 - is over here in this logo data j/s and I
28:14 - have a new directory called data and
28:17 - that's where that's in so
28:21 - haven't haven't really done a lot it
28:23 - looks on the screen like it's a pretty
28:26 - big change but you know in terms of the
28:29 - code it's it's not really a lot so let's
28:35 - set the Pomodoro timer and start doing
28:39 - something
28:47 - so if you if you're not familiar with
28:49 - what we're doing here I set the timer I
28:51 - code for 25 minutes and then I take five
28:54 - minutes and I check in with the live
28:57 - chat if I need to check in with a live
29:00 - chat like I'm stuck if I have a question
29:02 - or something I will check in
29:03 - occasionally even during that 25 minutes
29:05 - but this just kind of keeps a nice pace
29:08 - so that I don't spend too much time on
29:10 - one or the other all right so first
29:17 - things first I absolutely know that I
29:19 - want to add some spacing in here so
29:22 - let's work on that first and then
29:24 - that'll give my brain like a little bit
29:27 - of time to think about what I want to
29:30 - try to clean this up so we need spacing
29:32 - here and then we need to add some
29:33 - padding to these cards yeah so that's
29:39 - yeah that's definitely I definitely want
29:43 - to do that
29:44 - okay so right now I probably can just
29:50 - add a bottom see so we have our sass
29:54 - file for logos so I'm gonna try to do as
29:56 - much as I can in the sass file otherwise
30:00 - something like this I would probably
30:02 - make an inline style but since we have a
30:06 - sass file let's try to keep this as
30:08 - clean as we can so at times we don't
30:14 - want tabs we want
30:31 - I'm trying I guess where I think the
30:36 - only cards will actually have will be
30:41 - logos I'm interested to see what this
30:48 - comes out as
31:05 - so it looks like alright we don't really
31:08 - have by default there's not really a
31:11 - class for those cards that we can use so
31:16 - I'm gonna have to add a class which is
31:17 - not a big deal I figured out out of
31:19 - class anyway so class and we're gonna do
31:23 - class name because in react you can't
31:28 - use just class okay obviously react is
31:31 - like you know using javascript in here
31:34 - and class is used you know for other
31:37 - things in javascript so we have to do
31:39 - class name camel case then we can add
31:43 - our class names just as we normally do
31:45 - so I think logo card is the decent name
31:52 - for this and so now we can go logo card
32:01 - and let me think
32:11 - twenty four pixels let's try 24 pixels
32:25 - anything
32:30 - oh you know what
32:34 - it looks like the class didn't
32:44 - it looks like the class wasn't applied
32:46 - so let's let's do this let's just take
32:53 - this up we don't really need that I'm
32:55 - sure there's a way to add a class on
32:56 - here I don't know maybe I did it wrong
32:58 - but this will work too oops
33:09 - actually what am I doing with these
33:11 - camelcase look
33:19 - it's the only thing I've noticed that
33:22 - messes me up and only sometimes when I'm
33:25 - doing you know react
33:27 - so with this JSX you switch back and
33:30 - forth between camelcase
33:31 - and then when you're using the CSS not
33:36 - in line you normally use hyphens so
33:40 - occasionally
33:41 - I'll use them in the wrong place let me
33:52 - make this bigger I'm sorry I forget I
33:54 - made this smaller earlier so that I
33:57 - could see more of the code and I didn't
33:58 - make it bigger littler container and
34:01 - then we're gonna say yeah actually let's
34:08 - see if it'll work just on the container
34:10 - I wanted to put it on the card but I
34:13 - don't think it'll really matter and I
34:17 - guess it will now let's see did this
34:19 - okay so the class did get applied
34:24 - [Music]
34:30 - it actually didn't apply our margin
34:42 - hmm
34:50 - alright I'm gonna check the chat really
34:52 - quick because this seems like one of the
34:53 - times where I made a silly mistake and
34:56 - you all would probably catch it it's
35:01 - misspelled okay awesome thank you
35:03 - cont a thank you I'm glad I remembered
35:09 - to check the live chat if you haven't
35:12 - watched before then you probably don't
35:16 - know what I was talking about but often
35:18 - it happens that when I have an issue
35:20 - I'll try for you know 5-10 minutes to
35:23 - figure it out on my own and then I'll
35:25 - look at the live chat and realize that
35:27 - right away somebody usually more than
35:30 - one person has caught my mistake and
35:31 - told me about it and I just didn't think
35:34 - to look over so thank you for that let's
35:41 - see I don't know
35:48 - there we go
35:53 - all right so we are getting that margin
35:59 - on the bottom
36:09 - I'm not sure where that's our
36:11 - margin-bottom is not even showing up
36:14 - though in dev tools which is weird
36:15 - I have dev tools open on my other screen
36:21 - oh okay I see it it's just really far
36:24 - down down the list okay so that took
36:30 - longer than expected due to mainly just
36:34 - the type of yeah I like that I may put a
36:48 - media query in there and make it smaller
36:50 - on on mobile I know on mobile I might
37:04 - actually we'll see how it looks and how
37:08 - much time I want to put into this but I
37:11 - kind of like the idea of not having the
37:15 - cards or basically having the cards take
37:17 - up the entire width and then just having
37:21 - a line dividing them so it almost really
37:24 - wouldn't be a card anymore so you can
37:27 - see in the material design spec they
37:29 - there are examples of that I mean
37:31 - there's also examples of material design
37:33 - apps that will use cards in a row like
37:37 - this as well so I've seen it both ways
37:40 - we'll just I'll see I'll get out my
37:44 - phone and test on there and see what
37:47 - it's like okay
37:59 - now let's add our padding actually
38:03 - around our cards and
38:23 - maybe now that I think about it it would
38:27 - be useful to have a class on here
38:29 - where's our component
39:28 - okay
39:43 - what do you think do I need to pass this
39:46 - down as a prop and then put it on here
39:51 - because I'm I'm almost positive that
39:55 - this has worked before to just add the
39:58 - class name directly on to a component
40:00 - and it it works it comes out in the
40:04 - final markup I mean maybe it's just the
40:09 - way the components are set up
40:31 - okay
40:49 - classes
41:05 - whose
41:33 - there we go
41:47 - that's why syntax highlighting is really
41:51 - nice and that you get used to how things
41:54 - are the color it's supposed to be so you
41:56 - immediately know when you mess something
41:58 - up because it doesn't change to the
42:00 - color that you know it should be so in
42:03 - that case I knew I was doing something
42:04 - wrong here I didn't actually catch what
42:07 - it was immediately I ended up trying to
42:09 - adding this into here thinking it had
42:11 - something to do with with this in
42:14 - reality it was because I was I put this
42:17 - in quotation marks instead of in curly
42:20 - brackets but it's better in the end
42:26 - anyway but now it's more consistent so
42:28 - let's see if this works now so what I'm
42:31 - trying to do here then is just pass
42:33 - whatever classes that I want this to
42:36 - have down to this component to see if
42:42 - then it will actually work as a class
42:45 - name since it wasn't before
42:48 - yep and now it does work so now we do
42:52 - these do have the class name of logo
42:54 - card so now we can use that in our in
43:04 - our sass file the card if you're not
43:10 - familiar with sass you can nest CSS
43:13 - rules like that and basically that would
43:16 - be the same as if I did you know logo
43:20 - card container and then logo card and in
43:27 - regular CSS so it basically gets turned
43:32 - into that as soon as I save it and it
43:36 - gets saved in a the logos dot CSS file
43:40 - just a lot less to type out especially
43:43 - when your nesting things not really a
43:46 - great idea to nest things too deep it
43:49 - gets kind of messy but you know 3d I'm
43:54 - okay with three deep start getting like
43:56 - four more than probably
44:00 - not really necessary alright so on the
44:04 - logo card we want padding so let's give
44:09 - it some padding
44:10 - I don't want top or bottom padding right
44:13 - now let's see I should probably check to
44:18 - see now actually I do want there it
44:20 - looks like there's no top padding
44:22 - currently that makes sense see now that
44:32 - I think about it we don't really need
44:34 - padding on the whole thing
44:35 - we just need padding around this section
44:38 - around the image section so that
44:47 - currently the div that holds the image
44:52 - does not have a class let's see if we
45:00 - can find it and if that would be easy
45:04 - okay card media overlay I'm not the
45:09 - overlay we want the the image
45:16 - hmm
45:24 - if we're gonna put a clasp anywhere
45:25 - it'll probably be here so let's do it
45:35 - mr. container all right hopefully okay
45:45 - well that's not too bad it got actually
45:47 - on the outer div so that's I don't know
45:49 - why there it's nested two divs actually
45:52 - one two yeah there's two days probably
45:55 - because one of them ends up being the
45:57 - overlay and the other one is the
45:59 - container but for now since we're not
46:00 - having an overlay on these I'm okay with
46:03 - that
46:05 - and we can just select that image
46:08 - container
46:20 - and I'll spell container right this time
46:22 - and then now we can do let's give it a
46:26 - pixel all the way around I'm not exactly
46:30 - sure why I'm sure there's a good reason
46:32 - for it but for some reason and material
46:34 - design it seems like things go in 8th so
46:37 - you know you have 8 pixels 16 pixels and
46:41 - like normally that normally you see
46:46 - mostly just 8 and 16 a lot in the
46:49 - documentation so that's what I normally
46:51 - start with and that usually seems to
46:57 - work pretty well and it looks right with
47:00 - the rest of what's going on in material
47:03 - design all right not bad although now
47:07 - that I look at it it probably is a good
47:09 - idea to not include the padding at the
47:12 - bottom because we have quite a bit of
47:15 - white space here so I think that's
47:19 - that's just not necessary so let's take
47:24 - this and we'll go eight eight zero and
47:32 - then eight alright so if if you're not
47:37 - familiar with this way of writing this
47:38 - in CSS when you do all four it goes top
47:44 - right bottom left if you were just going
47:49 - to do two it's the first one is top and
47:54 - bottom and then the second one is right
47:56 - and left
48:01 - and it looks like did I mess it up
48:05 - I must have messed something up because
48:10 - it does not look what did I did
48:22 - what did I do wrong
48:30 - you still have our image container Oh
48:37 - silly mistake
48:39 - no and no commas there we go nope so I'm
48:49 - just gonna leave that up there for
48:50 - another second so do not put commas in
48:53 - between these I don't know why I did
48:57 - that okay I like that better it's not a
49:02 - huge difference I mean I can see cuz I
49:04 - was really looking for it not it's not
49:07 - something that would jump out at you as
49:09 - a change but I think overall if you're
49:12 - talking about all these cards it's a
49:14 - significant decrease in the overall
49:16 - amount of scrolling that you have to do
49:18 - to get around you know if you add up all
49:20 - those eight pixels then down the line
49:24 - okay that looks better we have some
49:26 - padding it could probably do with a
49:28 - little bit more padding but I'm okay
49:30 - with that I don't want these images to
49:31 - be too small in comparison to the cards
49:33 - because you know the logo images are the
49:36 - the whole point of the page it's the the
49:38 - focus all right so I'm gonna go ahead
49:43 - and commit this because you know
49:45 - basically this is just margin and
49:47 - padding stuff it goes together before we
49:49 - move on to anything else be good time to
49:52 - commit this will also be a good kind of
49:56 - example of how to commit I know I give I
50:00 - go through this example frequently but I
50:02 - figure I'm sure there's there's always
50:06 - you know somebody possibly new who
50:09 - hasn't seen it who's just starting out
50:13 - maybe hasn't even used yet before so in
50:18 - the terminal we we already have have
50:22 - gone through some installation and setup
50:23 - to have get running so this definitely
50:29 - there takes something to get to this
50:31 - point but once you have get running if
50:33 - you want to commit which is like
50:36 - basically a snapshot of your project at
50:38 - that point in time then here's how you
50:41 - do it first thing I always do is
50:43 - get status and that might be a little
50:48 - bigger
50:49 - I'd sight get status this look this lets
50:52 - me know what files have changed this is
50:55 - really good you may have accidentally
50:56 - changed the file will not realize that
50:58 - and then this will remind you
51:00 - but maybe you changed something that you
51:02 - didn't you shouldn't have and this is a
51:06 - way to catch it otherwise this at least
51:11 - will verify that hey the stuff that I
51:12 - wanted to change is in fact change and
51:14 - these are the things that we've changed
51:17 - so now I'm gonna do a git commit and
51:22 - this is kind of a shorthand we're gonna
51:24 - put a flag here we're gonna put the a
51:26 - flag which means add so we're gonna
51:29 - combine two steps normally you would get
51:32 - add and then you would get commit but
51:34 - we're combining them so we're gonna get
51:36 - commit and then with a and we're gonna
51:39 - put em em means we get to put a message
51:41 - right in line and with with this commit
51:45 - if we didn't put the M when we hit enter
51:47 - it would bring up whatever our default
51:49 - editor was and we have to type the
51:52 - message in there but for now I'll just
51:55 - say add padding to those margin two cars
52:08 - yeah
52:13 - and in terms of the commit message there
52:16 - are different ways that people like to
52:19 - do that and there are some standard ways
52:20 - so I'd say maybe just check out the way
52:24 - that is recommended by some of how other
52:27 - companies do it and things and you know
52:28 - figure out what way works for you if
52:30 - it's a small project is just you working
52:32 - on it
52:33 - not a huge deal but if you're working
52:35 - with a lot of other people you
52:37 - definitely want to have some sort of
52:38 - standard way to do commit messages all
52:42 - right so the commit has gone through
52:45 - normally you won't see all of this stuff
52:48 - this is unique to our project that we
52:51 - have all these tests running and some
52:53 - auto formatting but you will see this
52:56 - part here at the bottom if it's worked
53:00 - so three files change and it lets us
53:02 - know 14 insertions four deletions great
53:05 - now we want to make sure this gets
53:07 - synced up to a repo on github so we type
53:09 - git push that's gonna push the code up
53:12 - to github origin/master
53:16 - so we're pushing the master branch there
53:22 - we go great everything works now if we
53:27 - were not gonna go there but if we were
53:28 - to go to the git repo the code would be
53:30 - exactly the same as it is on our local
53:32 - machine great and that was perfect
53:36 - timing so now we can take five minutes
53:39 - go over to the live chat get answer some
53:41 - questions and then we'll come back to
53:42 - the code
53:48 - all right so I'm gonna swell there's a
53:50 - actually a lot in the live chat so you
53:53 - all have been busy that's awesome I like
53:56 - when the live chat is Lively all right
54:05 - so I'm gonna have a lot to catch up on I
54:07 - don't think I'll get through everything
54:09 - in this five minutes I'll have to have
54:12 - to catch up at the end
54:21 - okay I see you I've given me a lot of
54:24 - different suggestions for four databases
54:29 - for storing the images so I'm seeing all
54:32 - that I'll save all those so I can refer
54:34 - to them and then see about maybe check
54:39 - them out and see which one we should use
54:59 - okay Brian I just saw your comments
55:03 - there about the border on the links so
55:07 - is saying it's just it says not clear
55:11 - he's saying it's not clear UI without
55:14 - some sort of distinction between the
55:15 - buttons and the background so there
55:18 - should be some type of border
55:19 - distinction
55:20 - okay and just to clarify let me know if
55:28 - are you referring to these or these or
55:35 - both I mean obviously this does have a
55:38 - hover effect but I could see your
55:41 - comment could definitely apply to both
55:43 - so let me know what you were thinking
55:48 - specifically if you're still if you're
55:52 - still watching if you're still here
55:53 - please let me know
56:06 - tech neck technique Renault says
56:09 - Pomodoro bruh yes Pomodoro he says I
56:13 - can't even do more than 5 minutes of
56:14 - coding before I visit reddit /youtube
56:18 - you got it it's easier to focus if you
56:21 - do the Pomodoro because you know it's
56:23 - like all right 25 minutes I'm gonna
56:25 - ignore everything except the code I'm
56:27 - not saying I always do that but when I'm
56:31 - in the zone I definitely do like I do my
56:33 - 25 minutes I ignore everything and then
56:35 - I do my best during the 5 to just not
56:38 - think about the code and then just go
56:41 - right back to it
56:42 - so that's best case scenario that's how
56:46 - it works sometimes you get interrupted
56:49 - and you can't ignore it it's important
56:51 - but otherwise the Pomodoro is nice
56:55 - because you it it helps if you know you
56:57 - only have to focus for a certain amount
56:59 - of time and it's a relatively short
57:00 - period of time and then you can relax
57:02 - for a little bit if you're just saying
57:04 - like man I got hours and hours of work
57:06 - let's just get to it that's pretty tough
57:09 - right like if you're running a marathon
57:11 - like you don't just sprint the whole way
57:13 - right you're never gonna gonna make it
57:15 - but like if you if you would knew you
57:18 - could take breaks along the way then you
57:20 - might sprint and then rest and sprint
57:22 - and then rest and that would be
57:24 - legitimate and doable would be like
57:26 - interval training but this is the same
57:29 - thing with your brain right it's I don't
57:33 - know hopefully that made sense hopefully
57:34 - you all know what I'm talking about
57:36 - at least it works for me i but I've I
57:39 - think at least some somewhat that's the
57:42 - idea behind it técnicos says I'm 37 and
57:50 - my attention span is as long as my baby
57:52 - daughter
57:58 - Joshua says I did over 1 hour and 30
58:02 - minutes of coding and I'm 10 Wow so
58:06 - Joshua 10 years old and doing coding
58:09 - that's awesome thanks for watching
58:13 - hopefully you're getting something
58:15 - useful out of this that's that's really
58:18 - cool my my oldest is 8 years old and
58:24 - really interested in getting him more
58:28 - and you know excited about coding
58:31 - getting kind of into it so you'll have
58:34 - to let me know let me know what what you
58:37 - really like about coding as a young
58:40 - person maybe that'll that'll help me out
58:44 - with with my kids
58:49 - let's see Blake asks what local web
58:52 - server is he using I was in nginx ok
58:56 - Patrick says it's a hot module reloading
58:58 - with webpack it said Joshua says
59:02 - question in my website when I put done
59:06 - the code for buttons the buttons only
59:08 - affect the first questions help me
59:12 - please
59:16 - ok cool it looks like so it looks like
59:19 - some of you in the live chat are helping
59:22 - out Joshua with with this code question
59:25 - so Joshua let let me know if you need
59:27 - extra help you know let me know I don't
59:31 - know if you're on Twitter or anything
59:32 - that usually if people need extra help
59:34 - they message me on Twitter but you can
59:38 - you can put it in the comments on
59:40 - YouTube or however whatever is best for
59:42 - you if you want to email it that's cool
59:45 - too
59:54 - okay my five minutes is up so I'm going
59:59 - to stop going through the live chat and
60:02 - I'll come back to it after our next
60:06 - session is over
60:17 - let's see I do want to see Blake's
60:31 - Blake's answer
60:43 - okay or I'm sorry not Blake Brian's
60:47 - answer about the buttons so Brian says
60:52 - the hover effect is good once you're
60:53 - hovering over it but a border would make
60:55 - it very clear for the user without
60:56 - having to navigate and guess okay
61:09 - okay cool let's check that out actually
61:12 - so I think we have more options than
61:16 - this built in to material UI at least
61:20 - there was for materialized I'm assuming
61:22 - we have it materialized so let's just
61:24 - check out what they have and see if
61:28 - it'll fit what we're trying to do so
61:33 - should be under
61:41 - it looks like they don't let me check
61:43 - out materialized I I really thought
61:46 - there was another another style but I
61:53 - remember seeing
62:03 - maybe not maybe where did I see that I
62:08 - guess I didn't so I the only the
62:11 - difference in materializes they do have
62:14 - this border here I kind of like that I
62:20 - may add this in I do like that
62:25 - distinction now they've gone with a
62:30 - slightly different so they the same
62:33 - color that's used throughout for links
62:36 - is used for the button so that would be
62:39 - a visual cue so I like that
62:52 - let's go to material design guidelines
62:57 - just to double-check and see what
63:05 - they're doing
63:06 - okay so similar so their basic example
63:14 - actually does look well it's so much the
63:17 - combination so it does not have the the
63:22 - line there the the border but it does
63:26 - have the accent color let's see what
63:32 - kind of options
63:48 - okay so adhere this this is actually the
63:51 - style that it's your UI is using okay
64:06 - okay here we do have the border so it
64:09 - looks like all of these options within
64:10 - material design are valid they're used
64:14 - but yeah so I'm not seeing
64:32 - not seeing a border
64:40 - so we're not really gonna get any ideas
64:43 - I think from material design spec
64:44 - because it looks like they're not using
64:46 - that but I'm almost positive that I've
64:48 - done it before so let me just check out
64:51 - a few of the sites that I've done I'm
64:55 - gonna bring up on my other screen and
64:56 - I'll pull them over if I find it I use
65:01 - cars that I know
65:12 - all right let's check this out
65:30 - hmm
65:53 - Wow I must be losing my mind even so
65:58 - I've been consistent throughout all my
66:00 - sites and that basically I have used the
66:10 - card actions without border but I have
66:16 - always done
66:18 - I've capitalized it and I've used the
66:22 - link color which is usually you know
66:26 - your accent color so a lot of times I do
66:28 - this sometimes I do a blue depends on
66:30 - the color scheme for the site I think
66:33 - I've even done I did read for the last
66:35 - project and I think I've gone with a
66:39 - slightly darker or a slightly heavier
66:42 - font weight so let's just see how it
66:49 - looks with that I kind of want to add I
66:59 - want to see what it looks like with that
67:01 - line I think it'll probably look a
67:04 - little bit better so I'm gonna add in
67:07 - the line I'm gonna change this to a
67:09 - color that is the same link color that
67:12 - we're using on the rest of the site and
67:17 - we'll see how that looks
67:19 - I don't think I use this hover effect in
67:23 - any of my other sites I'm not opposed to
67:25 - using it now okay
67:35 - color
67:44 - I should probably let me grab this color
67:47 - first and see how it looks I'm still I'm
67:50 - not really sure that I want to keep this
67:52 - color yet but at least it'll just give
67:55 - us something something to look at
68:14 - all right so if we go in here image
68:17 - continue should be able to do
68:38 - what I should do is put make all these
68:41 - colors variables and then have like
68:44 - maybe like a color CSS file and then
68:46 - import it which maybe we'll do that at
68:49 - some point but for right now I think
68:51 - this will be okay
69:18 - area
69:20 - okay so we have that let's see
69:30 - so dude there we go so we want
69:58 - here's a border let me bring this over
70:01 - because I'm I keep referring to this
70:05 - might be a good idea if I show it so
70:09 - basically I've just done on this div
70:13 - which contains our action items I've
70:20 - just done a border obviously I don't
70:22 - want to keep it that gray color let's go
70:25 - with maybe 54 see how that looks and
70:32 - that's still too dark
70:39 - there we go that looks better if I
70:42 - decide to keep it I'll look up what it
70:44 - actually is and materialize but
71:00 - actually I have a thought
71:04 - [Music]
71:07 - what we really want people to do when
71:09 - they go to the logos is download a logo
71:12 - but we're not actually saying anywhere
71:15 - downloaded the logo and we may be doing
71:19 - that here at the top so that I'd like to
71:28 - check out what language we we have there
71:30 - already okay so we are saying please
71:38 - select a logo to download so we're
71:41 - giving some direction so maybe we ought
71:47 - to have say download maybe we should say
71:53 - download here and then give them these
71:56 - options and then that would make it it
71:59 - would make it clear the action that
72:01 - should be taken
72:14 - okay yeah what do you think
72:23 - let's let me grab this and we don't have
72:32 - a class for that yet so let me just put
72:39 - it over here for now we'll see about
72:42 - adding a class but I think I need you I
72:52 - need a title
73:01 - let's go so you could see here so here's
73:05 - a generic card here we go card title
73:15 - yeah
73:33 - how do we do that I'm gonna have to look
73:35 - back at how we originally imported all
73:40 - the all the different options so I can't
73:44 - remember how we did it for that generic
73:47 - card component I thought I had it up
73:56 - available on a screen beforehand I guess
74:04 - not
74:06 - so let's go back we're gonna find
74:16 - so in actually in our logos view we had
74:23 - an example
74:24 - oops yeah this is it
74:32 - so we had an example of the cards there
74:38 - we go
74:41 - that's what we want to see
74:48 - so we can go back so this is one of the
74:51 - great things about get also in github
74:54 - that we can go back to all these
74:56 - previous versions and see so even though
74:59 - this hasn't been in that file for a
75:02 - little while we've we've had many save
75:04 - since then we can still check it out so
75:07 - what I'm interested in is card title
75:14 - there we go that's what I think we'll
75:17 - probably want and then we'll also
75:31 - no that's not what I wanted sorry about
75:33 - that
75:34 - what I wanted was this one okay so yeah
75:40 - here we go
75:41 - so card title and port that and then
75:52 - let's see yeah we did okay so we just
75:56 - put a string in and that's what title
75:58 - okay
76:01 - that's pretty straightforward but
76:05 - nothing wrong with double-checking I
76:07 - guess so I'm gonna put it here just
76:12 - because this is how it appears you know
76:14 - on the page so it makes sense to me to
76:17 - be right there
76:23 - let's see how that looks not not really
76:31 - sure
76:33 - mm yeah okay I don't like that it's way
76:39 - too much space wait he was
76:50 - well Lisa gives us something to look at
76:57 - yeah this part is hard I guess it's hard
77:03 - to share what I'm seeing in my head
77:05 - with all of you unless I actually put it
77:08 - on here so so be some trial and error
77:12 - this part if I get rid of this part
77:19 - maybe he would look better
77:39 - okay
77:42 - actually I don't dislike this as much
77:50 - I'm still not sure I don't like that
77:53 - it's very repetitive saying download
77:56 - every time but I'm not sure all right
78:02 - I'm gonna go to the live chat cuz I've
78:03 - I've tried a few things here and I want
78:07 - to see what would you all think alright
78:12 - looks like somebody had a good idea
78:13 - except I'm seeing people saying like
78:15 - like this idea so let me scroll up and
78:17 - try to find the beginning of this idea
78:25 - okay John Hanson said asked with this
78:30 - material you I have a download icon that
78:36 - is a great idea
78:42 - so let's check it out
78:50 - sweet so download icon that could work
78:56 - now this material UI it has their own
79:01 - icons correct let's see okay you can't
79:08 - do it
79:15 - so I if you remember from the last
79:18 - project I prefer to use SVG icons
79:22 - instead of font icons for several
79:27 - reasons one if you use an SVG icon I
79:31 - usually now in this case it's I'm not
79:34 - sure how they're bringing in the SVG
79:35 - icons but when I do it on my own I only
79:39 - bring in just the one that I need and I
79:42 - put the the actual SVG you know code
79:47 - right there in line so nothing has to
79:50 - load there's no network requests with
79:52 - font icons I mean you have it at least
79:55 - one Network request to get the font and
79:59 - you're getting extra icons that you
80:01 - probably never use I mean really you
80:03 - only use I mean maybe I never use more
80:08 - than a dozen font icons on any site and
80:10 - probably usually no more than a half a
80:12 - dozen and a fawn icon set could come
80:15 - with a lot more than that you could do a
80:19 - custom font icon set which I've done
80:22 - before as well to try to keep it small
80:23 - but the other thing I don't like about
80:25 - font icons are I've had issues with
80:28 - different browsers not displaying them
80:31 - properly and it was it's been hard to
80:34 - troubleshoot because I can't always
80:36 - replicate the issue I've gotten
80:39 - screenshots from users so I know it's it
80:42 - is happening but then it's difficult to
80:45 - to kind of really see what's going on so
80:48 - I've never had that problem with SVG
80:50 - icons so that's why I prefer SVG's
81:00 - so let's check out how they do it
81:26 - okay so it looks like they already have
81:28 - some they already do have some
81:34 - components
81:45 - well let's see do they have a list of
81:52 - these somewhere so if they have a
81:57 - download icon which seems like a pretty
82:02 - common icon already we may be able to
82:08 - just use that like they're doing here
82:22 - actually I'm just gonna guess because if
82:25 - I added a file download icon and I was
82:31 - naming it like this then I'm gonna guess
82:35 - unless one of you already let's see I'm
82:40 - not sure you see or don't I come on it
82:43 - looks like brown already found it I it
82:46 - took a little bit of the fun out of it
82:47 - but it'll probably be faster this way I
82:49 - was just going to try to guess based on
82:51 - what they were naming I mess it up
83:13 - let's see
83:18 - my eye just saw as I was looking over
83:21 - the live chat Curtis asked can I use
83:22 - this project on my portfolio yeah I
83:29 - guess so I mean are you saying you want
83:32 - to help work on this project and put it
83:33 - in your portfolio then yeah I mean yeah
83:35 - that's fine because whatever commits you
83:37 - have are certainly yours or you wanted
83:40 - to use the project as the basis to build
83:42 - your portfolio on I'm fine with that as
83:44 - well so either way a hum is fine with me
83:54 - okay so since that link didn't work
83:58 - let's try this
85:11 - all right so what I've done here is I've
85:17 - just guessed
85:18 - really what the name should be and this
85:22 - is really I could have looked it up but
85:25 - I just thought it would be fun to guess
85:28 - so I'll try it if it doesn't work then
85:32 - I'll I'll look it up I went to that oh
85:38 - it's here
85:41 - icon style is just not define define
85:44 - like 50 all right so say it's not gonna
85:48 - work
85:50 - 950 oh let's get rid of that did you see
86:06 - okay so it didn't find the module all
86:09 - right we'll look it up
87:24 - there we go
87:26 - ICG icons
87:50 - actually did I add this I don't remember
87:53 - if I added this that might be why we
87:56 - can't get it let's check it out
87:58 - I don't I don't have it to you I I cough
88:05 - so let me I've obviously have some icons
88:11 - right because we like we have an icon
88:14 - let me get rid of this so how am I using
88:19 - icons
88:42 - so see like obviously we have an icon so
89:05 - all right so what do you think real
89:07 - quick I only want to take maybe like two
89:09 - minutes on this is it worth it to pull
89:12 - in the entire material you I I con do
89:16 - you think we'll use that many icons that
89:18 - it's worth it or should I just grab the
89:20 - SVG really quick and and put it in there
89:24 - from material icons
89:34 - which one when I just download that now
89:37 - just in case we end up using it
89:58 - okay importing named exports in this way
90:28 - yeah
90:33 - okay this might not even work because I
90:36 - might not be using that all right cool
90:40 - everybody thinks we should just do the
90:42 - SVG really quick and that is fine with
90:46 - me because that's what I am used to
90:56 - doing anyway so see look at that that's
90:59 - so it's so simple like this tiny amount
91:02 - of code like you just copy and paste it
91:07 - really simple there okay so let's do
91:17 - this let me see if I can let's see if I
91:22 - can pass it in here if it'll work
91:31 - yeah it works okay awesome so we have it
91:35 - downloaded not not ideal right now yeah
91:45 - I might just get rid of this effect
92:00 - and then we need to put in some text I'm
92:07 - not sure let's see if it'll let me do
92:09 - this
92:13 - where's the shot yeah they're not
92:23 - working so let's
92:56 - no that works well at least we get what
93:01 - we wanted on the screen I don't know why
93:03 - I could thought I thought that I could
93:04 - do the first thing now that I think
93:05 - about it it was really obvious that that
93:08 - would not work all right so I need to
93:14 - change obviously need to make this line
93:17 - up a little bit better but what do you
93:21 - think I mean it's for the hotel maybe I
93:23 - should line it up better because it
93:24 - looks really weird right now
93:28 - let's see what's going on here
93:53 - I could probably just make this bigger
93:57 - and then it might work sort of height
94:04 - with
94:12 - let's just double it see what that does
94:18 - well way too big
95:13 - yes you small for sure okay we need to
95:20 - make this bigger
95:55 - I just took a display flex-a-lite I'm
96:01 - sorry
96:01 - all right cool thank you John Hansen I
96:04 - just saw your ear advice
96:11 - let me gonna get rid of that
96:33 - mmm nope see that on the wrong element
97:05 - I don't know
97:08 - okay okay try a line items
97:57 - maybe I should put this text in its own
98:01 - span and then I could move it
98:03 - independently that way like potentially
98:07 - maybe I could give it a little bit of
98:08 - padding and just bump it up that might
98:11 - not work
98:22 - who
98:26 - all right let's see actually I'm ashamed
98:29 - my time
98:30 - oh wow I did not hear that go off did I
98:38 - forget to start it or if I did I just
98:40 - totally miss I don't know who that
98:47 - alright let's see I do want to try I
98:56 - hate to have so many nested spans but I
99:10 - just want to I need to have it let's see
99:36 - and that's not gonna work
100:02 - all right Lily thing I had the same
100:10 - problem what project was all right I
100:21 - think I had the same problem on a
100:23 - project I did last year so let me see
100:35 - although it's possible that it was with
100:44 - font icons and not SVG's and that would
100:51 - be unfortunate because it might not work
100:54 - I have it up on my other screen
100:58 - [Music]
101:16 - was a phone icon and I was able to use
101:22 - vertical-align:bottom I did not have the
101:28 - text in a separate span but the font
101:35 - icon itself was actually very clear line
101:37 - bottom so alright not sure that it'll
101:41 - work since it's a phone icon but it's
101:43 - worth shot
101:59 - oh not bad
102:07 - middle that's not too bad
102:18 - that's not perfect but that's a lot
102:21 - better
102:21 - all right let me copy this in before I
102:25 - forget on the SVG it's
102:27 - vertical-align:middle all right great
102:29 - but
102:30 - [Music]
102:53 - see that does it did you do
103:04 - all right cool
103:11 - now let's make sure these are the same
103:13 - color I don't think we need
103:38 - I actually this would be a cool way to
103:42 - show
103:51 - a cool way to show how to do variables
103:55 - and incest all right so we're using the
103:59 - same color here more than once right
104:01 - that's that's repetitive anytime we're
104:02 - being repetitive we should be able to
104:04 - find a better way to do that what do
104:07 - they call it dry do not do not repeat
104:10 - okay so incest we have a cool way to
104:16 - save values in this case we're gonna
104:21 - save this color so let's call this fu s
104:24 - yellow so fu s 4 Franciscan University
104:27 - of Stephenville and then yellow because
104:31 - it's a yellowy color and then we can put
104:36 - this this hex color here now when we use
104:46 - this down here we can say fu s yellow
104:52 - and that's the color so if I say this we
104:58 - should have this color I think I can get
105:01 - rid of this now as well and then let's
105:06 - see
105:09 - Oh happen there I mess something up oops
105:19 - guess semicolons alright cool
105:22 - so see there we go now the font icon or
105:27 - the SVG icon and the text are both the
105:30 - same color and we've used this variable
105:33 - now I guess it'll be cool to see what
105:37 - the CSS is so on this side is the sass
105:42 - but this is what actually gets sent to
105:44 - the browser so you can see here like the
105:49 - the variable isn't even there anymore
105:51 - instead it's just the correct hex hex
105:57 - code for that color and then you can see
105:59 - instead of things being nested there's
106:02 - its proper CSS so it's pretty cool
106:08 - really useful feature and the cool thing
106:12 - now it doesn't seem like much now
106:14 - because it was only two but potentially
106:17 - if we had a lot of different components
106:22 - that we're all sharing that same color
106:24 - and then let's say I go show this to the
106:26 - other people in my department and they
106:27 - say I really hate that yellow all I have
106:30 - to do is go in here and change it I mean
106:35 - potentially I could I could name this
106:37 - something more generic like like link
106:40 - color or accent color and then I could
106:44 - change it to whatever color I want I get
106:45 - it wouldn't make sense change the color
106:46 - I guess if I'm calling it yellow so I
106:50 - could do something like this link color
106:58 - FUS yellow
107:07 - blink color and then I could save that
107:14 - and you can see it's already and my
107:16 - editor picked up that that's the color
107:18 - and if I go in here and give it a
107:22 - refresh to be sure see it picks it up
107:25 - too
107:25 - now that actually makes even more sense
107:27 - because now I I can still basically I
107:29 - can have color variables for all my
107:31 - entire color palette and actually let's
107:33 - do that this is the color palette for
107:40 - Franciscan University so - let's get rid
107:44 - of I didn't want to there we go I
107:51 - actually changed the yellow to make it a
107:55 - bit darker so it's different I'm pulling
107:59 - these from the from the style guide I
108:02 - have it opened on my other screen so
108:08 - yeah I don't I don't know if I think
108:11 - I've shown you this before so this is a
108:13 - style guide I made us at some point last
108:15 - year this was the first thing I think I
108:18 - ever successfully built in react and I
108:21 - think this was done with I can't
108:26 - remember if I did this with create react
108:28 - app or with next I think I tried it with
108:31 - both I don't remember what I ended up
108:32 - going with
108:33 - but anyway it's not it's certainly not
108:37 - up to date with some of what I've been
108:38 - doing lately but you could at least see
108:42 - like some of the colors and the ideas of
108:44 - like the direction that I wanted to go
108:47 - with this so it probably wouldn't be too
108:50 - much work to get this up to date but
108:54 - until now I haven't no one except for
108:56 - for me and like one other person that I
108:59 - work with has ever even needed to
109:00 - reference this so it hasn't been a
109:02 - really high priority but anyway that's
109:06 - where I got the colors from and so like
109:12 - potentially then all I would have to do
109:14 - is put in like let's say F us dark blue
109:19 - in here and then it would change
109:22 - automatically everywhere that I've used
109:24 - link color so it could save a ton of
109:28 - time alright so let me get rid of this
109:36 - download text why haven't I taking that
109:38 - out yet
109:42 - let's get rid of that there's my title
109:47 - card too let's see okay not bad need to
110:00 - do the same thing for PSD as well I'm
110:03 - still not 100% sure whether I'll keep
110:05 - JPEG and PSD or whether I'll go back to
110:08 - the old web in print we'll see I'm not
110:16 - sure what do you all think people are
110:17 - used to having it's a web in print
110:21 - instead of select web print or the
110:24 - options in reality they have the option
110:27 - to get a JPEG version of the image and a
110:30 - PSD version should I switch it up
110:34 - because it's more accurate or should I
110:37 - leave it like this I mean I guess this
110:39 - is just a more technical way of
110:41 - describing it this is just describing
110:42 - what you would use it for you're not
110:47 - really sure but I mean it's not it
110:53 - wouldn't necessarily always be for web
110:54 - if they wanted to put it into like a
110:56 - PowerPoint that's not really a web but
111:00 - you could you'd still want to use this
111:01 - and not a PSD
111:08 - all right so last thing I'm gonna do I
111:11 - think yeah last thing I'm going to do is
111:14 - I'm just gonna put the an icon here as
111:17 - well and then we'll we'll commit this
111:20 - and then I'll get to all the questions
111:22 - so if you have questions put them in
111:25 - there or start thinking of them now
111:28 - because I'll get to them on probably
111:30 - about five minutes all right so let's
111:36 - see
111:36 - [Music]
111:46 - let's take this
112:18 - see if this works without me having to
112:20 - put parentheses around it
113:14 - where did I put that Oh inside masonry
113:43 - I'll shoot now I'm confused and this up
113:48 - here at least makes more sense
114:01 - area I mean here
114:08 - I should've added this span
114:42 - I see I mean I'm probably making this
114:44 - more complicated but yeah then I should
114:46 - have but the idea was maybe I ought to
114:49 - make this into a component that I can
114:52 - pass in this text too and then there
114:57 - would be a lot more clean and I wouldn't
114:58 - have to have all this SVG stuff in here
115:01 - twice does that make sense
115:59 - okay Patrick said or just use the
116:02 - component that material you I already
116:03 - gives you four file download icon well
116:12 - that's I tried to figure out what that
116:13 - component was earlier and I couldn't I
116:16 - couldn't get it to work
116:20 - so let's see oh actually no you're right
116:24 - there was one that you just had to put
116:27 - the SVG a stuff in my mistake I forgot
116:30 - about that one okay yes so let's see
116:40 - what do we need SVG icon that is a great
116:46 - idea alright so bringing that in and
116:54 - then let's bring in
117:22 - yeah I could use that I do want it to
117:36 - I didn't want to be able to pass in the
117:37 - text there's something I can I can do
117:39 - that maybe I can maybe I'm just not
117:42 - looking right
118:00 - okay
118:02 - what I'm still gonna pull this in
119:07 - all right let's see if that works
119:16 - oops left an extra span in there it was
119:20 - even in red I don't know how I missed
119:22 - that one all right let's check that out
119:27 - okay yet I mean it worked it's just not
119:30 - giving me the correct color let's see
119:34 - why I guess it's actually added the
119:46 - color in
119:56 - it's what they probably want me to pass
119:58 - the color and yeah
120:09 - oh this this ruins all my efforts over
120:12 - here to have to pass this color and I
120:15 - almost want to just put important on the
120:18 - end so I don't have to change it but
120:21 - I'll do it like this so let's add color
120:35 - and there we go and then
120:44 - let's do the same thing here but then
120:48 - let's
120:58 - there we go all right now now we have
121:04 - our download icons okay not bad
121:17 - that looks a little bit more legit all
121:24 - right cool let me commit this and then
121:26 - we'll do some question-and-answer stuff
121:29 - here to finish up get this one in
122:05 - all right so looks like there's a lot in
122:08 - the live chat so I'm gonna scroll up to
122:14 - where I left off and try to get through
122:16 - as much as I can so since there's so
122:18 - much I'm again I'm not definitely not
122:21 - gonna read everything out so I'm just
122:22 - gonna focus on the questions
122:25 - most especially on questions from people
122:28 - who are newer I definitely want to help
122:31 - them to feel welcome not that I don't
122:33 - appreciate all of you that that are here
122:36 - frequently all right
122:49 - all right so that's the all up on github
122:52 - now awesome
123:06 - okay
123:18 - all right so found where I left off at
123:30 - oh it looks like at some point
123:34 - Joshua could not hear the stream so
123:37 - sorry I see that at the time so I'm not
123:42 - sure what the issue is it looks like it
123:45 - doesn't look like anyone else was having
123:47 - the same issue so anyway that I guess
123:51 - let me know if that was ever resolved
123:54 - and if you found out what the problem
123:55 - was
123:56 - I'm not sure if it was anything on my
123:59 - end but if it was I definitely want to
124:01 - know about it
124:02 - so I can fix it
124:30 - okay I do want to read this it says John
124:33 - Anson said Jesse styled components
124:37 - dot-com keeps your JSX code clean
124:40 - because you don't mess it up with CSS
124:43 - classes you build a CSS component and
124:45 - style it style that and CSS it nests
124:49 - just like s CSS next project yeah
124:53 - actually that sounds cool
124:55 - definitely check that out for the next
124:57 - project remind me if I forget though if
125:01 - if you're around cuz I'm not sure how
125:03 - much longer this project will take I'm
125:06 - thinking actually just to give you an
125:08 - update I'm thinking this project may end
125:10 - up being like another two weeks or so
125:12 - not that it would take us that long to
125:14 - complete it cuz it probably wouldn't but
125:17 - it's probably gonna take that long for
125:20 - me to get feedback so I did we had a
125:23 - department meeting this morning and I
125:24 - did tell everyone that we need to figure
125:28 - out what exactly we want to update and
125:30 - change in this and so I need everyone's
125:34 - feedback so I'm just not really sure I
125:38 - mean you know everyone's busy they all
125:40 - have their own things going on so it's
125:41 - probably not gonna be high on anyone's
125:43 - priority list
125:45 - so I will keep reminding everyone but
125:47 - really it's not like we can't launch
125:50 - this without the changes but it would
125:52 - just be good to know about them and do
125:54 - the changes before we finish because it
125:56 - could possibly save us from doing some
125:59 - work that we may end up either getting
126:00 - rid of or changing so anyway so my
126:05 - prediction is at least two more weeks I
126:08 - didn't really think we'd be working on
126:11 - it for that long but there's been a lot
126:14 - of really nice improvements to this
126:15 - project and a lot of extra things that
126:17 - are really great to have like all the
126:19 - testing that was I was not anticipating
126:24 - that but I'm glad that we have it now
126:41 - actually patrick said pretty sure that's
126:43 - what he used in the last project yeah
126:46 - now that you say that you're right I
126:47 - think that was called installed
126:49 - components I didn't even remember it I
126:52 - was reading through it yeah I think it
126:54 - was yeah I just remember the tag that I
126:59 - had to use was style and then I would
127:02 - have a space and then I read JSX and
127:04 - that was the tag so I guess that was
127:09 - style Cantona's not sure I remember what
127:16 - it was called but I still remember how
127:18 - to how to use it so I guess that's more
127:20 - important
127:37 - okay so skillful mess asks how do you
127:42 - install react Sebastian says npm
127:47 - install' save react yeah you can
127:50 - definitely install react like that if
127:52 - you're just getting started with react
127:55 - though I think probably using create
127:59 - react app would be the best way to go so
128:01 - look up create react app go to their
128:03 - github repo and then follow the
128:06 - instructions there so it just depends on
128:10 - your skill level right so create react
128:14 - app is going to do a lot of things for
128:16 - you to get you started so that you can
128:20 - get right to the react and don't have to
128:22 - worry about webpack so I'm not not
128:26 - really sure what your skill level is in
128:29 - terms of web pack but maybe you might
128:32 - want to go with something like that or
128:34 - next Jes also does a similar thing
129:00 - okay Sebastian I just saw your comment
129:03 - about making the buttons off each occupy
129:05 - half the width of the cards alright
129:10 - maybe I'll try that and see how that
129:12 - looks
129:32 - Wow okay so skillful mess is nine years
129:35 - old Wow
129:39 - that's awesome that you're you're able
129:41 - to code and follow you know follow this
129:45 - kind of stuff at 9 years old so that's
129:47 - great I'm gonna say the same thing I
129:48 - said to Joshua who was 10 years old as
129:53 - if you get a chance please let me know
129:55 - what what it's like what your motivation
129:57 - is like for coding and how you got into
129:59 - it at such a young age because I said I
130:01 - have an 8 year old that I'd love to try
130:05 - to get him interested in coding
130:18 - skillful messes you should do a series
130:20 - of the reddit programming challenges
130:23 - actually we have someone doing
130:27 - programming stuff challenges from reddit
130:29 - I believe it's from reddit on the this
130:33 - channel already so shoot what is it
130:38 - called I can't remember what the title
130:41 - was is called we have to look it up I
130:48 - can't believe I have to look it up I see
130:49 - it constantly
131:04 - the daily programmer that's it so the
131:07 - the series the daily programmer
131:09 - on this channel free code camp channel
131:11 - is is exactly that so so check that out
131:15 - I'm I do not have time right now to do
131:21 - another series and in fact the only
131:24 - reason I can eat have time to do this is
131:26 - because it's I'm doing my normal work
131:28 - otherwise it would be it would be really
131:32 - difficult to do something with this this
131:35 - many hours every day consistently
131:53 - okay cool I just saw Brian ahead
131:57 - commented the separation line with the
131:59 - link colors works well just don't think
132:01 - the plain black text makes enough of a
132:03 - distinction and we're talking about this
132:05 - here so that just reminded me that I did
132:09 - not leave that line in so I'll probably
132:11 - end up putting that back in at some
132:14 - point because I think I think that did
132:17 - make a nice distinction so maybe I like
132:20 - to see it on more than just one does I
132:22 - just tested on one to see what I think
132:24 - but what it really looks like but I
132:26 - think that was kind of a nice nice
132:31 - distinction than them just kind of
132:32 - sitting there
132:51 - okay I'm over halfway through the live
132:54 - chat now so probably just not too much
132:59 - longer till I get to the bottom so if
133:00 - you have any questions that you haven't
133:04 - put in here yet
133:05 - I probably only have a few more minutes
133:19 - Oh Patrick I just saw your comment about
133:22 - the file download icon being included
133:25 - already oh
133:40 - Rohan says how does it do circular hover
133:42 - animations where I'm not sure where it's
133:53 - doing the circular hover I mean it does
133:55 - like the the little ripple effect when
133:57 - clicking so I'm not I'm not exactly sure
134:06 - ever on if you're which hover animation
134:11 - you're referring to
134:54 - Emerson as does anyone know how to make
134:57 - the dev tools look black yeah so it
135:02 - looks like okay someone already answered
135:05 - so just for anyone watching later on
135:07 - they can't see the live chat it's really
135:08 - easy for dev tool so you go into dev
135:11 - tools like you normally would go up here
135:13 - to the icon for the menu into settings
135:17 - and then theme will be right up there at
135:20 - the top and you can pick the darker the
135:21 - light theme and obviously I picked the
135:25 - dark theme and that's it it's so super
135:28 - easy comes built-in
135:42 - Alexander I see now that you're trying
135:44 - to tell me to put the styles on the SVG
135:46 - and not the span and so yeah you were
135:48 - definitely right so I didn't see that
135:50 - sooner
136:19 - qsk i is the name says why is there no
136:22 - super chat I've never tried using the
136:26 - super chat so from what I understand the
136:29 - super chat is just if you want to get
136:31 - money from your stream so I'm currently
136:34 - not interested in getting money for this
136:37 - stream so I haven't tried super chat if
136:40 - there's some other reason why I should
136:42 - be using super chat let me know but I I
136:46 - thought it was just if you wanted money
136:56 - Isaiah says I'm having trouble deploying
136:58 - my portfolio react router website to
137:02 - github pages help okay
137:05 - Isaiah's if you use create react app for
137:09 - it
137:10 - check out Gavin's pull request on my
137:13 - project says Gavin just did the same
137:15 - thing for this project that I'm working
137:18 - on and it was maybe pull requests 35
137:22 - somewhere around there so check out the
137:25 - closed pool request I think it's the
137:29 - whatever the last one from Gavin was if
137:32 - you follow those steps of how he did
137:35 - things it should work if you didn't use
137:38 - create react react app I'm not really
137:41 - sure I guess I'd have to check out how
137:43 - you did things but create react app the
137:46 - documentation on the github repo does
137:48 - have a section for how exactly how to
137:51 - get it to work on github pages
138:01 - okay when I asked you all about what to
138:04 - do what words I should use hear JPEG PSD
138:09 - or whether I should put web and print so
138:12 - some of the ideas here Gavin says keep
138:16 - what they are used to in my opinion okay
138:18 - Ron says go with web and print if people
138:20 - are used to it
138:22 - Curtis says leave it brian says JPEG PSD
138:24 - that tells me exactly what I'm getting I
138:26 - usually think of a print logo as some
138:28 - sort of vector format John Hanson says
138:32 - JPEG PSD it looks like we're pretty
138:34 - split ok rhoann says maybe you could do
138:40 - screen and print actually yeah that
138:43 - would be more accurate than web and
138:45 - print yeah maybe I like that idea yeah
138:54 - okay I think about that screen if I do
138:58 - change it from JPEG and PSD I think I'll
139:02 - probably go with screen and print
139:04 - instead of web and print
139:24 - David said you should define the palette
139:26 - in another file and then import it and
139:28 - the others at CSS files yes that's
139:31 - that's definitely what I which should be
139:34 - done I was just kind of thought it might
139:38 - be cool to just demonstrate it so I just
139:41 - did it all right here
139:42 - but obviously cuz I'm not even using
139:46 - these yet but yeah ideally since I have
139:50 - lots of different sass files I would
139:54 - want to have let's say my own sass file
139:57 - that I could call like palette or colors
139:59 - or whatever I wanted to I could even
140:01 - call it variables if I I could have
140:03 - other things besides colors in there and
140:06 - then any time I was going to use one of
140:07 - those variables I could just include it
140:09 - I could import it at the top and then
140:11 - have access to it in these other files
140:13 - so that that would be the better way to
140:15 - go so I'll probably do that whenever I
140:19 - work on the next page where I need to
140:20 - use these then I'll probably pull them
140:22 - out and do it properly Bryan says do
140:30 - they have vector formats of those logos
140:31 - I always prefer prefer vector yeah it's
140:37 - actually surprisingly like somewhat not
140:40 - straightforward to get different logo
140:42 - formats around here so I agree I prefer
140:47 - the vector formats so if I can get them
140:50 - I'll try to get them but it's not like
140:55 - I've requested them before and then been
140:59 - given like JPEGs so I'm not really sure
141:04 - what what's up with that but usually I
141:08 - just kind of let it go and but but I'm
141:13 - with you there
141:14 - the vector versions of the logos would
141:16 - be ideal
141:35 - okay Sebastian I saw Sebastian mentioned
141:38 - again when it wouldn't look better if
141:41 - each button occupied half the card with
141:43 - with the with centreline text I'll try
141:48 - it out
142:18 - Alexander says the top row navigation
142:20 - and logos page is not looking good on
142:22 - mobile will you fix that
142:24 - yes so the idea is so right right now
142:29 - this to give everyone an idea right yeah
142:32 - it looks terrible it's really bad
142:35 - the idea is to change this into a select
142:40 - input or I could drop down menu once it
142:44 - gets to a certain so probably I don't
142:49 - want it to drop onto two lines so
142:51 - probably really early on it's going to
142:54 - go to a drop-down maybe I could probably
142:57 - do with a little bit less space between
142:59 - these and it would still work but at
143:00 - some point it'll go to a drop down mine
143:10 - blocks coder says I like your free code
143:13 - camp website Jessie actually like the
143:17 - the free code camp website is not it's
143:20 - not a really mine so I just volunteer
143:24 - and do this for free code camp there's a
143:26 - lot of other people that volunteer and
143:28 - do other things and that it worked on
143:29 - the website and so I I haven't actually
143:32 - contributed at all to the free code camp
143:35 - website although that would be cool to
143:39 - do someday for now I'm just just on
143:41 - these videos but thanks though
143:55 - okay alright so I've gotten to the end
143:59 - of the chat
144:00 - I've got through all the questions still
144:03 - got a few few suggestions and you could
144:05 - try out on on this but definitely
144:07 - looking better than it did at the
144:08 - beginning and we learned how to use
144:11 - SVG's within material UI and to utilize
144:16 - their SVG icon component so that was
144:20 - pretty cool like what else yeah I mean
144:27 - other than that I mean use some basic
144:29 - stuff but I learned a little bit about
144:31 - sass along the way so not bad not a bad
144:37 - job if I haven't looked at the time in
144:40 - quite a while but oh yeah almost two and
144:42 - a half hours for today's stream so a
144:45 - good time to wrap it up thanks so much
144:48 - for everybody that stuck around we still
144:50 - have people still watching after two and
144:52 - half hours so thank you thank you all
144:55 - for watching and you know everybody
144:58 - that's gonna watch this later on and I
145:00 - really appreciate it I I'll be back
145:07 - tomorrow tomorrow's gonna be a weird
145:09 - time I have a meeting scheduled at 2:30
145:12 - and then I also have a doctor's
145:14 - appointment
145:15 - at 10:30 so Oh sometime tomorrow morning
145:21 - I'll put on YouTube and then on Twitter
145:23 - when I'm gonna strain I really want to
145:26 - stream tomorrow it might end up having
145:28 - to be a short stream at a weird time but
145:31 - depending on how long my doctor's
145:33 - appointment is maybe I can do a stream
145:35 - from like 1:00 to 2:00 Eastern Time that
145:38 - seems like that that might be doable but
145:41 - I'll let you know tomorrow so anyway
145:43 - thanks again for watching and for all
145:45 - your help in the live stream and for the
145:47 - pool requests and it's just it's just
145:50 - overwhelmingly generous of you oh I
145:52 - really appreciate it and I'll be back
145:55 - tomorrow
145:56 - have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody it's Jessie and today we're going to keep working on this section so I can get on the screen all right so I figure we'll finish up this section because we're almost there so it's kind of didn't want to move on to anything different and as you can see I've got all the correct logos in here now so I actually went back and looked at my original code for this and luckily when I first did this this is the format that I put all the data for the logos in I'm I'm not even really sure why I did it like this because it was basically like static a static page but I think I was using handlebars for templating and I just I did it like this obviously at the time I didn't use Const because I had no idea what that was whenever I did this but and I you know I didn't do it exactly like this but basically I had a separate logos DOJ's file and it had this data at the top and then passed it into a handlebars template which is awesome because I was really afraid I was going to have to actually type out this data I had forgotten until about an hour ago that I did it like this so I just copied and pasted this over and in state I why imported logos and instan state for data and now it's logos so down here I'm putting in I had that you know prefix this with the actual paths and some relative pass here and then I just add the relative path on to the end and everything's working so that was really cool that was that was definitely a timesaver so actually even for now I don't have to do anything I can leave these logos where they are I would prefer to house them somewhere else just so that I have better I guess control over them because I can't directly the directory that they're these are and now that this is referencing I don't have any access to that so what I had to do initially was send all these files like I literally had to email these files did I email him it's possible that I was given access to some sort of network drive but in any case someone in the IT department had to copy and paste everything over because I wasn't allowed to have access to it and I still don't have access so I'd rather have have these somewhere else so off the figure out where the best place to house these are and maybe you can let me know what you think I'm not really I mean obviously we're gonna have some sort of server for this but all right I don't know whose number that is sorry my phone's ringing I don't know the number so I'm not gonna answer usually if I don't know the number there's somebody trying to sell me something where was I unless my train of thought oh okay so obviously we're gonna have some sort of node server to run this but I don't really know should i house the files on that same server or is there a better place that I could house the files I'm thinking like maybe there's some sort of outofthebox thing that I haven't done before that might be cool to try so let me know if you know of anything like that and and then we'll see what like I said we don't have to figure that out really at all for a while I think I am just a little bit nervous since I don't have access to that folder I can't if something were to happen I'd rather get the files out of there and at least backed up somewhere else if something were to happen I'm pretty sure I have all these backed up at the very least on on my computer possibly in a cloud drive somewhere but I would still feel better if it's in a different spot so that's pretty much all I've done I had a few pull requests I think they're all pretty minor I had some from Kevin one from Sebastian kind of editing some environment variables so that we don't when you're testing it doesn't send a lot of projects to rike when when testing the service request form and yes you can check out I think it was like 37 38 and 39 with the pool request numbers if you want to check those out and I think that's all it's Oh big change I forgot that I changed this so I changed the layout a bit in terms of how the logos are displayed so yesterday we just had the logos and not in cards I wanted to see what it would look like if I put them in cards obviously I would want to space this out a bit I mean it there needs to be some space between these but other than that my reasoning for wanting to put them in cards were that currently these all have white backgrounds possibly some have transparent backgrounds but some of them definitely have white backgrounds I don't think all of them might I could do transparent and our background here is that kind of grey color but in the live site is white so it works that it looks like all the logos are just the logos but when the logos are up against the gray you can see the white outline which I didn't think looked very good so I thought okay well if they're gonna look like there's a square of white around them anyway or a rectangle why not make it a card the other thing that I needed was I needed a way to be able to click either you know JPEG or PSD so I'll show you what it looks like right now so here's the effect that I have right now when you hover these two little kind of buttons come up one says web one says print we went back and forth initially as to what we should call this like would people understand what a JPEG is what a PSD is and what they should use them for so we ended up going with web and print because generally that's what people would end up using them for I think I've clicked tracking on all these so I may be able to find out are people actually clicking these and which one they're they're really clicking more do we really need both but for now I I kind of I didn't really want to do the same effect and you all can let me know how you think this looks I'm just not I'm not sure I'm not sure that I like it just seems it seems like there's a lot going on I think maybe I've gotten to like more simplistic design since I've done this kind of less motion so I'm not really I don't really like that when you hover the not only does the logo appear you know to grow but then you also have these and then there's even a hover effect on these so I just I'm not really sure what I want to do with it right now I've just been kind of looking at it a lot and trying to visualize what it could be so I don't want to change it dramatically because I want users to still be familiar with what they're used to so we need do something with that we also need to do something with with these here not really sure that how they currently are I don't really know that I like that but I'm I'm not exactly sure what I want to do with that either so I'm open to your ideas sometimes when I get to this point and I want to make a change but I'm not sure I like design inspiration elsewhere so I'll go through usually like other sites that use material design and see how they've handled similar use cases and usually I can get some inspiration I I really don't like to let's say copy anybody's design exactly because I don't know there's just something in me that wants to do it once that my own kind of spin on it but I do like to see how it's how it's handled so maybe I'll do some of that we'll see but there are a few things that definitely need need worked on now so we need to connect the data to these buttons for the links to be able to work I'd like to be able to add the correct alt text titles to these images definitely add some space between these cars still not sure if we'll keep the cards on or not and possibly even some padding but I don't like how that is touching the sides there most of the other logos are okay but some of them some of them still touch all right so that's that's basically an overview of the the problems that we're gonna try to to solve today and we'll see how far we get and and what we come up with I just pushed to the github repo and let me check this time because yesterday I thought I pushed and then I had some errors and so I went like for an hour without realizing that the code wasn't updated but in fact it was updated and it didn't work so the latest version of the code is in the master branch in the git repo for this project the links in the description so you all can check that out I'm gonna check the live chat before I start the Pomodoro timer just to see what y'all think I know I asked several questions at the beginning so and I haven't checked or any answers yet so we're gonna do that also I guess a for anybody's no I I haven't done like the the normal what's this show about I think for a while so for anybody who's new that's watching I'm a frontend developer and this is me doing my everyday work so it's not rehearsed I'm gonna make mistakes we're gonna try to work through them it's not exactly a tutorial although I try my best to explain what I'm doing and at various levels even even some basic things because we have people of all skill levels in here feel free to ask any questions I'll take breaks periodically to answer questions and then at the end I'll try to answer every question that I had missed throughout the show let's see there's a second stream on Instagram that's a view of me as I'm coding and my office so you can check if you want to it's kind of just more like a novelty thing because obviously the main thing is the code and not not really my face but occasionally people check in and I guess maybe they're curious to see what would I look like what my office looks like and if you happen to be watching this on Instagram of the recording check out the free code camp YouTube channel and you get a better idea of what I'm doing because you'll be able to see the code in my screen okay so enough enough introduction let's check out would you all have to say about this project and some of the problems that I want to say problems so some some of the use cases and issues we're gonna we're going to deal with so okay so I did I had a comment a while before the stream started so I'm not even sure if so this is from mine blocks coder not sure if you're still watching but mine blocks coder said maybe you should try doing streams earlier I've thought about doing different times occasionally I do streams at different times in fact this week I've done I varied the times I think last week I did an early stream which it would have been in the morning for my time zone but I'm certainly open to changing the time that I do these this time in the afternoon seems to be a good time to where I can be most consistent I do have some meetings that I always have let's say like in the morning so if I were to change it to a different time earlier I probably couldn't be consistent every day with that time but I'm open to it just let me know let me know what you think let me know in the live chat but it might actually be more helpful to put a comment to this video and then that way I'll be able to see it you later on so especially for the people who are gonna watch the recording obviously the live stream is not a good time for you so let me know when a good time would be preferably if you could figure out when that time would be in Eastern time that would be great but otherwise if you don't want to do that just let me know what timezone urine as well so I could figure out what time that would be for me and I'm definitely open to trying that I think it would be cool to let other people be able to participate in the live stream but otherwise I'm gonna try to stick with this time unless unless I I find out that there's a significant number of people who would rather have it at a different time cool Mayank says great work dude thank you thank you I appreciate that thanks for watching Abhishek's is nicely done thanks to you thanks you all are very very kind today to start out with so hey everyone a few people were saying hi okay so I did ask a question about where to store these images Patrick says maybe AWS s3 Rohan says let's not go for the nucular off so maybe that would be overkill for what we need but actually I do these small projects and sometimes I do think that the way I do some of them might be overkill for that particular project but but keep in mind what I'm trying to do with these small projects is not only fulfill all of the requirements for that particular project but prepare for larger projects so the main website for my university with the Franciscan ddu knees redone I think it's badly in need of being redone because the site is very very slow and that not to mention design outdated you know there's there's a lot of things that need updated but the number one thing for me is nobody's going to stick around even see what it looks like because the load times are insane and I've gotten the load times down about as far as I think I can given the current system so all of these small projects I want to test out something that I know I'll probably need with a larger project so while it might not be necessary for a smaller project in in the bigger picture of what I'm trying to do as a whole I need that test I need to be able to prove it I'd like to be able to say to my boss and the people higher up who are gonna have to approve things all the I'd like to be able to either they have my plan to say hey all these things that I'm saying that I can do I've done them here with this site that site that site so they can actually go and see it and see that it works and that I've tested it because it is gonna sound a bit crazy when I propose all this it's going to be much different than their current set up which you know the set up is just a traditional dotnet based content management system hosted on Windows servers here on campus in our IT department a very oldschool set up so what I'm proposing just you know briefly is a react site pulling data from content management system maybe WordPress but then having just heavy caching to handle the load and load balance across I don't know maybe like half a dozen digital ocean droplets to handle to where like copies of all the react apps will be potentially drawing data from multiple WordPress installs from different sites so that concept is really foreign I think to to a lot of people so it would be great to be able to say like hey we've done it so if you notice in the last project we did the load balancing right we pulled in data from WordPress so anyway hopefully you understand what I'm saying because I have had people ask definitely more than once like why are you doing it like this do you really need to do that and that's really why I mean I do want to make really good sites so it's cool to try to use the latest thing even if I you know don't have to but I'm trying to prove by actually doing these things that my plan will work for the main site so anyway sorry that was a long time spent on what wasn't even really a question from you just they it just popped into my head but it does it it is an answer to questions I've received previously about the same topic okay david says what about storing them in manga or something yeah I'm thinking about that I'm I'm actually considering some sort of database they said don't really know if it's necessary but once again like it's not it's not just about what's necessary for the project it's about what what should I be testing and learning to prepare for other projects that I know I'll need to do Sebastian said card style looks good the hovering button kind of overkill yeah okay Sebastian says the card style so I'd asked what you all think about this so he said sir card style goes straight to the point you see the image choose the format really simple okay yeah that's kind of what I thought you you know the hover you have to actually hover over the image see it's not even apparent what you're supposed to do with these images you would think somebody would try to click but I've I've noticed that people who aren't really that familiar with technology they don't use it a lot they're not really inclined to move around and click there their mindset is well like if I don't move or click anything I won't mess it up which is kind of weird because obviously I'm sure all of us when we go into a website we're like I'm clicking and hovering everything like I want to see how this thing works that's because that's what we do you know but I can't rely on that you know other people don't always work like that so I agree Sebastian I think it would be better to have it more straightforward like this but still open I still don't I just don't love how this looks so I'm trying to think of a way to make it look a bit better I mean maybe it'll look better when I put in the proper you know spacing here we'll see well we'll mess around with it today and see what it looks like Rohan said watching the Instagram stream where is the mic you mean like like we're actually like you can't see the mic in the image or is the mic messed up on the Instagram stream so you can't hear my voice so while I'm waiting for the delay and the answer to that I'll get do another take another question so code BCC says what's a good resource to learn frontend development I'm experienced on the backend wanting to get into frontend and Sebastian says for basics check free code camp and then Udacity and learn code Academy yeah I definitely agree those are great resources that'll that'll get you on the right path for sure alright David said watching from Ireland so don't make it too early yeah that's the thing if I change the time it'll work better for some people but worse for others there's not really any way around it you know we have people from from all over the world so I you know I don't know maybe maybe I can try to vary so that I don't I don't know some days a week I'll do it in the afternoon some days in the morning and then I don't know I'll think about it okay Patrick must have visited the main site franciscans edu and he says it's brutally slow yes yes it is Rohan says I would suggest a common static content CDN or just a different droplet for all sites going forward I like that idea I like that we had thought about that before for different projects and yeah that would really useful rowan says clicking and hovering I have dev tools open all the time I didn't want to I didn't want to go that far with it but I'm the same way you know I have my my browser extension here right so it tells me what everything's built from all the time so I'm always looking at this and then also going to dev tools if I see something odd like you know or just I just want to know how did they do that so yeah I'm right with you there oh okay so we're gonna ask the mic for YouTube recording it's in there actually yeah it's hard to get the mic and me in the recording at the same time so yeah I just tried it I'm kind of like my face is way off to the side and you can't really see all of it so anyway it's a nod I have to have it at a far enough away from the mic so that it doesn't cause interference but then it also makes it so that basically the angle of it is coming like from where I have the live chat the screen that I have the live chat on so when I'm looking at the live chat it's a decent angle because I'm looking pretty much right at the the camera for on my phone but when I look at the code I'm I'm turned completely you know kind of sideways you get a side profile of me but not really anything I can do about it I'd rather have the mic be in the central location so everyone can hear because as I said I mean I consider the the Instagram just kind of a secondary novelty thing oh cool Rowan says the audio on YouTube is very consistent even though you move a lot awesome yeah the mic is basically like as in the middle as I can get it without blocking a screen so so far it's been working out well actually it was a really cheap mic I got it like on Amazon for it was a good deal I want to say it was like less than $15 or something but it got good reviews so I thought it was worth a shot okay let's get to some code so Gavin did ask did he complete the logo screen and the last live think so I didn't exactly complete it I we got we got to the point where we had some of this up here but we just had some like test testing so it wasn't these this content of these names and we had some like just one image in here to test but it actually wasn't even loading so we added a little broken image icon but it was enough to test that they were getting on the page and then when we clicked these up here it did it changed since then I put I pulled in data for all the images so that we could get all the the actual images that are gonna be on this once it's live and I put it in some cards and then I also put in the proper name so in terms of code you can see I just put these in up here it's not really a super long list so I'm kind of okay with it being here but I could see like it might make sense to move this somewhere else as well I could I could move it over here to this file and export that as well so we'll see I will if this starts to get long right now it's so short it just doesn't bother me if it starts to get longer maybe we'll move it maybe you know just to keep things clean but for now this is here and then all the data is over here in this logo data j/s and I have a new directory called data and that's where that's in so haven't haven't really done a lot it looks on the screen like it's a pretty big change but you know in terms of the code it's it's not really a lot so let's set the Pomodoro timer and start doing something so if you if you're not familiar with what we're doing here I set the timer I code for 25 minutes and then I take five minutes and I check in with the live chat if I need to check in with a live chat like I'm stuck if I have a question or something I will check in occasionally even during that 25 minutes but this just kind of keeps a nice pace so that I don't spend too much time on one or the other all right so first things first I absolutely know that I want to add some spacing in here so let's work on that first and then that'll give my brain like a little bit of time to think about what I want to try to clean this up so we need spacing here and then we need to add some padding to these cards yeah so that's yeah that's definitely I definitely want to do that okay so right now I probably can just add a bottom see so we have our sass file for logos so I'm gonna try to do as much as I can in the sass file otherwise something like this I would probably make an inline style but since we have a sass file let's try to keep this as clean as we can so at times we don't want tabs we want I'm trying I guess where I think the only cards will actually have will be logos I'm interested to see what this comes out as so it looks like alright we don't really have by default there's not really a class for those cards that we can use so I'm gonna have to add a class which is not a big deal I figured out out of class anyway so class and we're gonna do class name because in react you can't use just class okay obviously react is like you know using javascript in here and class is used you know for other things in javascript so we have to do class name camel case then we can add our class names just as we normally do so I think logo card is the decent name for this and so now we can go logo card and let me think twenty four pixels let's try 24 pixels anything oh you know what it looks like the class didn't it looks like the class wasn't applied so let's let's do this let's just take this up we don't really need that I'm sure there's a way to add a class on here I don't know maybe I did it wrong but this will work too oops actually what am I doing with these camelcase look it's the only thing I've noticed that messes me up and only sometimes when I'm doing you know react so with this JSX you switch back and forth between camelcase and then when you're using the CSS not in line you normally use hyphens so occasionally I'll use them in the wrong place let me make this bigger I'm sorry I forget I made this smaller earlier so that I could see more of the code and I didn't make it bigger littler container and then we're gonna say yeah actually let's see if it'll work just on the container I wanted to put it on the card but I don't think it'll really matter and I guess it will now let's see did this okay so the class did get applied it actually didn't apply our margin hmm alright I'm gonna check the chat really quick because this seems like one of the times where I made a silly mistake and you all would probably catch it it's misspelled okay awesome thank you cont a thank you I'm glad I remembered to check the live chat if you haven't watched before then you probably don't know what I was talking about but often it happens that when I have an issue I'll try for you know 510 minutes to figure it out on my own and then I'll look at the live chat and realize that right away somebody usually more than one person has caught my mistake and told me about it and I just didn't think to look over so thank you for that let's see I don't know there we go all right so we are getting that margin on the bottom I'm not sure where that's our marginbottom is not even showing up though in dev tools which is weird I have dev tools open on my other screen oh okay I see it it's just really far down down the list okay so that took longer than expected due to mainly just the type of yeah I like that I may put a media query in there and make it smaller on on mobile I know on mobile I might actually we'll see how it looks and how much time I want to put into this but I kind of like the idea of not having the cards or basically having the cards take up the entire width and then just having a line dividing them so it almost really wouldn't be a card anymore so you can see in the material design spec they there are examples of that I mean there's also examples of material design apps that will use cards in a row like this as well so I've seen it both ways we'll just I'll see I'll get out my phone and test on there and see what it's like okay now let's add our padding actually around our cards and maybe now that I think about it it would be useful to have a class on here where's our component okay what do you think do I need to pass this down as a prop and then put it on here because I'm I'm almost positive that this has worked before to just add the class name directly on to a component and it it works it comes out in the final markup I mean maybe it's just the way the components are set up okay classes whose there we go that's why syntax highlighting is really nice and that you get used to how things are the color it's supposed to be so you immediately know when you mess something up because it doesn't change to the color that you know it should be so in that case I knew I was doing something wrong here I didn't actually catch what it was immediately I ended up trying to adding this into here thinking it had something to do with with this in reality it was because I was I put this in quotation marks instead of in curly brackets but it's better in the end anyway but now it's more consistent so let's see if this works now so what I'm trying to do here then is just pass whatever classes that I want this to have down to this component to see if then it will actually work as a class name since it wasn't before yep and now it does work so now we do these do have the class name of logo card so now we can use that in our in our sass file the card if you're not familiar with sass you can nest CSS rules like that and basically that would be the same as if I did you know logo card container and then logo card and in regular CSS so it basically gets turned into that as soon as I save it and it gets saved in a the logos dot CSS file just a lot less to type out especially when your nesting things not really a great idea to nest things too deep it gets kind of messy but you know 3d I'm okay with three deep start getting like four more than probably not really necessary alright so on the logo card we want padding so let's give it some padding I don't want top or bottom padding right now let's see I should probably check to see now actually I do want there it looks like there's no top padding currently that makes sense see now that I think about it we don't really need padding on the whole thing we just need padding around this section around the image section so that currently the div that holds the image does not have a class let's see if we can find it and if that would be easy okay card media overlay I'm not the overlay we want the the image hmm if we're gonna put a clasp anywhere it'll probably be here so let's do it mr. container all right hopefully okay well that's not too bad it got actually on the outer div so that's I don't know why there it's nested two divs actually one two yeah there's two days probably because one of them ends up being the overlay and the other one is the container but for now since we're not having an overlay on these I'm okay with that and we can just select that image container and I'll spell container right this time and then now we can do let's give it a pixel all the way around I'm not exactly sure why I'm sure there's a good reason for it but for some reason and material design it seems like things go in 8th so you know you have 8 pixels 16 pixels and like normally that normally you see mostly just 8 and 16 a lot in the documentation so that's what I normally start with and that usually seems to work pretty well and it looks right with the rest of what's going on in material design all right not bad although now that I look at it it probably is a good idea to not include the padding at the bottom because we have quite a bit of white space here so I think that's that's just not necessary so let's take this and we'll go eight eight zero and then eight alright so if if you're not familiar with this way of writing this in CSS when you do all four it goes top right bottom left if you were just going to do two it's the first one is top and bottom and then the second one is right and left and it looks like did I mess it up I must have messed something up because it does not look what did I did what did I do wrong you still have our image container Oh silly mistake no and no commas there we go nope so I'm just gonna leave that up there for another second so do not put commas in between these I don't know why I did that okay I like that better it's not a huge difference I mean I can see cuz I was really looking for it not it's not something that would jump out at you as a change but I think overall if you're talking about all these cards it's a significant decrease in the overall amount of scrolling that you have to do to get around you know if you add up all those eight pixels then down the line okay that looks better we have some padding it could probably do with a little bit more padding but I'm okay with that I don't want these images to be too small in comparison to the cards because you know the logo images are the the whole point of the page it's the the focus all right so I'm gonna go ahead and commit this because you know basically this is just margin and padding stuff it goes together before we move on to anything else be good time to commit this will also be a good kind of example of how to commit I know I give I go through this example frequently but I figure I'm sure there's there's always you know somebody possibly new who hasn't seen it who's just starting out maybe hasn't even used yet before so in the terminal we we already have have gone through some installation and setup to have get running so this definitely there takes something to get to this point but once you have get running if you want to commit which is like basically a snapshot of your project at that point in time then here's how you do it first thing I always do is get status and that might be a little bigger I'd sight get status this look this lets me know what files have changed this is really good you may have accidentally changed the file will not realize that and then this will remind you but maybe you changed something that you didn't you shouldn't have and this is a way to catch it otherwise this at least will verify that hey the stuff that I wanted to change is in fact change and these are the things that we've changed so now I'm gonna do a git commit and this is kind of a shorthand we're gonna put a flag here we're gonna put the a flag which means add so we're gonna combine two steps normally you would get add and then you would get commit but we're combining them so we're gonna get commit and then with a and we're gonna put em em means we get to put a message right in line and with with this commit if we didn't put the M when we hit enter it would bring up whatever our default editor was and we have to type the message in there but for now I'll just say add padding to those margin two cars yeah and in terms of the commit message there are different ways that people like to do that and there are some standard ways so I'd say maybe just check out the way that is recommended by some of how other companies do it and things and you know figure out what way works for you if it's a small project is just you working on it not a huge deal but if you're working with a lot of other people you definitely want to have some sort of standard way to do commit messages all right so the commit has gone through normally you won't see all of this stuff this is unique to our project that we have all these tests running and some auto formatting but you will see this part here at the bottom if it's worked so three files change and it lets us know 14 insertions four deletions great now we want to make sure this gets synced up to a repo on github so we type git push that's gonna push the code up to github origin/master so we're pushing the master branch there we go great everything works now if we were not gonna go there but if we were to go to the git repo the code would be exactly the same as it is on our local machine great and that was perfect timing so now we can take five minutes go over to the live chat get answer some questions and then we'll come back to the code all right so I'm gonna swell there's a actually a lot in the live chat so you all have been busy that's awesome I like when the live chat is Lively all right so I'm gonna have a lot to catch up on I don't think I'll get through everything in this five minutes I'll have to have to catch up at the end okay I see you I've given me a lot of different suggestions for four databases for storing the images so I'm seeing all that I'll save all those so I can refer to them and then see about maybe check them out and see which one we should use okay Brian I just saw your comments there about the border on the links so is saying it's just it says not clear he's saying it's not clear UI without some sort of distinction between the buttons and the background so there should be some type of border distinction okay and just to clarify let me know if are you referring to these or these or both I mean obviously this does have a hover effect but I could see your comment could definitely apply to both so let me know what you were thinking specifically if you're still if you're still watching if you're still here please let me know tech neck technique Renault says Pomodoro bruh yes Pomodoro he says I can't even do more than 5 minutes of coding before I visit reddit /youtube you got it it's easier to focus if you do the Pomodoro because you know it's like all right 25 minutes I'm gonna ignore everything except the code I'm not saying I always do that but when I'm in the zone I definitely do like I do my 25 minutes I ignore everything and then I do my best during the 5 to just not think about the code and then just go right back to it so that's best case scenario that's how it works sometimes you get interrupted and you can't ignore it it's important but otherwise the Pomodoro is nice because you it it helps if you know you only have to focus for a certain amount of time and it's a relatively short period of time and then you can relax for a little bit if you're just saying like man I got hours and hours of work let's just get to it that's pretty tough right like if you're running a marathon like you don't just sprint the whole way right you're never gonna gonna make it but like if you if you would knew you could take breaks along the way then you might sprint and then rest and sprint and then rest and that would be legitimate and doable would be like interval training but this is the same thing with your brain right it's I don't know hopefully that made sense hopefully you all know what I'm talking about at least it works for me i but I've I think at least some somewhat that's the idea behind it técnicos says I'm 37 and my attention span is as long as my baby daughter Joshua says I did over 1 hour and 30 minutes of coding and I'm 10 Wow so Joshua 10 years old and doing coding that's awesome thanks for watching hopefully you're getting something useful out of this that's that's really cool my my oldest is 8 years old and really interested in getting him more and you know excited about coding getting kind of into it so you'll have to let me know let me know what what you really like about coding as a young person maybe that'll that'll help me out with with my kids let's see Blake asks what local web server is he using I was in nginx ok Patrick says it's a hot module reloading with webpack it said Joshua says question in my website when I put done the code for buttons the buttons only affect the first questions help me please ok cool it looks like so it looks like some of you in the live chat are helping out Joshua with with this code question so Joshua let let me know if you need extra help you know let me know I don't know if you're on Twitter or anything that usually if people need extra help they message me on Twitter but you can you can put it in the comments on YouTube or however whatever is best for you if you want to email it that's cool too okay my five minutes is up so I'm going to stop going through the live chat and I'll come back to it after our next session is over let's see I do want to see Blake's Blake's answer okay or I'm sorry not Blake Brian's answer about the buttons so Brian says the hover effect is good once you're hovering over it but a border would make it very clear for the user without having to navigate and guess okay okay cool let's check that out actually so I think we have more options than this built in to material UI at least there was for materialized I'm assuming we have it materialized so let's just check out what they have and see if it'll fit what we're trying to do so should be under it looks like they don't let me check out materialized I I really thought there was another another style but I remember seeing maybe not maybe where did I see that I guess I didn't so I the only the difference in materializes they do have this border here I kind of like that I may add this in I do like that distinction now they've gone with a slightly different so they the same color that's used throughout for links is used for the button so that would be a visual cue so I like that let's go to material design guidelines just to doublecheck and see what they're doing okay so similar so their basic example actually does look well it's so much the combination so it does not have the the line there the the border but it does have the accent color let's see what kind of options okay so adhere this this is actually the style that it's your UI is using okay okay here we do have the border so it looks like all of these options within material design are valid they're used but yeah so I'm not seeing not seeing a border so we're not really gonna get any ideas I think from material design spec because it looks like they're not using that but I'm almost positive that I've done it before so let me just check out a few of the sites that I've done I'm gonna bring up on my other screen and I'll pull them over if I find it I use cars that I know all right let's check this out hmm Wow I must be losing my mind even so I've been consistent throughout all my sites and that basically I have used the card actions without border but I have always done I've capitalized it and I've used the link color which is usually you know your accent color so a lot of times I do this sometimes I do a blue depends on the color scheme for the site I think I've even done I did read for the last project and I think I've gone with a slightly darker or a slightly heavier font weight so let's just see how it looks with that I kind of want to add I want to see what it looks like with that line I think it'll probably look a little bit better so I'm gonna add in the line I'm gonna change this to a color that is the same link color that we're using on the rest of the site and we'll see how that looks I don't think I use this hover effect in any of my other sites I'm not opposed to using it now okay color I should probably let me grab this color first and see how it looks I'm still I'm not really sure that I want to keep this color yet but at least it'll just give us something something to look at all right so if we go in here image continue should be able to do what I should do is put make all these colors variables and then have like maybe like a color CSS file and then import it which maybe we'll do that at some point but for right now I think this will be okay area okay so we have that let's see so dude there we go so we want here's a border let me bring this over because I'm I keep referring to this might be a good idea if I show it so basically I've just done on this div which contains our action items I've just done a border obviously I don't want to keep it that gray color let's go with maybe 54 see how that looks and that's still too dark there we go that looks better if I decide to keep it I'll look up what it actually is and materialize but actually I have a thought what we really want people to do when they go to the logos is download a logo but we're not actually saying anywhere downloaded the logo and we may be doing that here at the top so that I'd like to check out what language we we have there already okay so we are saying please select a logo to download so we're giving some direction so maybe we ought to have say download maybe we should say download here and then give them these options and then that would make it it would make it clear the action that should be taken okay yeah what do you think let's let me grab this and we don't have a class for that yet so let me just put it over here for now we'll see about adding a class but I think I need you I need a title let's go so you could see here so here's a generic card here we go card title yeah how do we do that I'm gonna have to look back at how we originally imported all the all the different options so I can't remember how we did it for that generic card component I thought I had it up available on a screen beforehand I guess not so let's go back we're gonna find so in actually in our logos view we had an example oops yeah this is it so we had an example of the cards there we go that's what we want to see so we can go back so this is one of the great things about get also in github that we can go back to all these previous versions and see so even though this hasn't been in that file for a little while we've we've had many save since then we can still check it out so what I'm interested in is card title there we go that's what I think we'll probably want and then we'll also no that's not what I wanted sorry about that what I wanted was this one okay so yeah here we go so card title and port that and then let's see yeah we did okay so we just put a string in and that's what title okay that's pretty straightforward but nothing wrong with doublechecking I guess so I'm gonna put it here just because this is how it appears you know on the page so it makes sense to me to be right there let's see how that looks not not really sure mm yeah okay I don't like that it's way too much space wait he was well Lisa gives us something to look at yeah this part is hard I guess it's hard to share what I'm seeing in my head with all of you unless I actually put it on here so so be some trial and error this part if I get rid of this part maybe he would look better okay actually I don't dislike this as much I'm still not sure I don't like that it's very repetitive saying download every time but I'm not sure all right I'm gonna go to the live chat cuz I've I've tried a few things here and I want to see what would you all think alright looks like somebody had a good idea except I'm seeing people saying like like this idea so let me scroll up and try to find the beginning of this idea okay John Hanson said asked with this material you I have a download icon that is a great idea so let's check it out sweet so download icon that could work now this material UI it has their own icons correct let's see okay you can't do it so I if you remember from the last project I prefer to use SVG icons instead of font icons for several reasons one if you use an SVG icon I usually now in this case it's I'm not sure how they're bringing in the SVG icons but when I do it on my own I only bring in just the one that I need and I put the the actual SVG you know code right there in line so nothing has to load there's no network requests with font icons I mean you have it at least one Network request to get the font and you're getting extra icons that you probably never use I mean really you only use I mean maybe I never use more than a dozen font icons on any site and probably usually no more than a half a dozen and a fawn icon set could come with a lot more than that you could do a custom font icon set which I've done before as well to try to keep it small but the other thing I don't like about font icons are I've had issues with different browsers not displaying them properly and it was it's been hard to troubleshoot because I can't always replicate the issue I've gotten screenshots from users so I know it's it is happening but then it's difficult to to kind of really see what's going on so I've never had that problem with SVG icons so that's why I prefer SVG's so let's check out how they do it okay so it looks like they already have some they already do have some components well let's see do they have a list of these somewhere so if they have a download icon which seems like a pretty common icon already we may be able to just use that like they're doing here actually I'm just gonna guess because if I added a file download icon and I was naming it like this then I'm gonna guess unless one of you already let's see I'm not sure you see or don't I come on it looks like brown already found it I it took a little bit of the fun out of it but it'll probably be faster this way I was just going to try to guess based on what they were naming I mess it up let's see my eye just saw as I was looking over the live chat Curtis asked can I use this project on my portfolio yeah I guess so I mean are you saying you want to help work on this project and put it in your portfolio then yeah I mean yeah that's fine because whatever commits you have are certainly yours or you wanted to use the project as the basis to build your portfolio on I'm fine with that as well so either way a hum is fine with me okay so since that link didn't work let's try this all right so what I've done here is I've just guessed really what the name should be and this is really I could have looked it up but I just thought it would be fun to guess so I'll try it if it doesn't work then I'll I'll look it up I went to that oh it's here icon style is just not define define like 50 all right so say it's not gonna work 950 oh let's get rid of that did you see okay so it didn't find the module all right we'll look it up there we go ICG icons actually did I add this I don't remember if I added this that might be why we can't get it let's check it out I don't I don't have it to you I I cough so let me I've obviously have some icons right because we like we have an icon let me get rid of this so how am I using icons so see like obviously we have an icon so all right so what do you think real quick I only want to take maybe like two minutes on this is it worth it to pull in the entire material you I I con do you think we'll use that many icons that it's worth it or should I just grab the SVG really quick and and put it in there from material icons which one when I just download that now just in case we end up using it okay importing named exports in this way yeah okay this might not even work because I might not be using that all right cool everybody thinks we should just do the SVG really quick and that is fine with me because that's what I am used to doing anyway so see look at that that's so it's so simple like this tiny amount of code like you just copy and paste it really simple there okay so let's do this let me see if I can let's see if I can pass it in here if it'll work yeah it works okay awesome so we have it downloaded not not ideal right now yeah I might just get rid of this effect and then we need to put in some text I'm not sure let's see if it'll let me do this where's the shot yeah they're not working so let's no that works well at least we get what we wanted on the screen I don't know why I could thought I thought that I could do the first thing now that I think about it it was really obvious that that would not work all right so I need to change obviously need to make this line up a little bit better but what do you think I mean it's for the hotel maybe I should line it up better because it looks really weird right now let's see what's going on here I could probably just make this bigger and then it might work sort of height with let's just double it see what that does well way too big yes you small for sure okay we need to make this bigger I just took a display flexalite I'm sorry all right cool thank you John Hansen I just saw your ear advice let me gonna get rid of that mmm nope see that on the wrong element I don't know okay okay try a line items maybe I should put this text in its own span and then I could move it independently that way like potentially maybe I could give it a little bit of padding and just bump it up that might not work who all right let's see actually I'm ashamed my time oh wow I did not hear that go off did I forget to start it or if I did I just totally miss I don't know who that alright let's see I do want to try I hate to have so many nested spans but I just want to I need to have it let's see and that's not gonna work all right Lily thing I had the same problem what project was all right I think I had the same problem on a project I did last year so let me see although it's possible that it was with font icons and not SVG's and that would be unfortunate because it might not work I have it up on my other screen was a phone icon and I was able to use verticalalignbottom I did not have the text in a separate span but the font icon itself was actually very clear line bottom so alright not sure that it'll work since it's a phone icon but it's worth shot oh not bad middle that's not too bad that's not perfect but that's a lot better all right let me copy this in before I forget on the SVG it's verticalalignmiddle all right great but see that does it did you do all right cool now let's make sure these are the same color I don't think we need I actually this would be a cool way to show a cool way to show how to do variables and incest all right so we're using the same color here more than once right that's that's repetitive anytime we're being repetitive we should be able to find a better way to do that what do they call it dry do not do not repeat okay so incest we have a cool way to save values in this case we're gonna save this color so let's call this fu s yellow so fu s 4 Franciscan University of Stephenville and then yellow because it's a yellowy color and then we can put this this hex color here now when we use this down here we can say fu s yellow and that's the color so if I say this we should have this color I think I can get rid of this now as well and then let's see Oh happen there I mess something up oops guess semicolons alright cool so see there we go now the font icon or the SVG icon and the text are both the same color and we've used this variable now I guess it'll be cool to see what the CSS is so on this side is the sass but this is what actually gets sent to the browser so you can see here like the the variable isn't even there anymore instead it's just the correct hex hex code for that color and then you can see instead of things being nested there's its proper CSS so it's pretty cool really useful feature and the cool thing now it doesn't seem like much now because it was only two but potentially if we had a lot of different components that we're all sharing that same color and then let's say I go show this to the other people in my department and they say I really hate that yellow all I have to do is go in here and change it I mean potentially I could I could name this something more generic like like link color or accent color and then I could change it to whatever color I want I get it wouldn't make sense change the color I guess if I'm calling it yellow so I could do something like this link color FUS yellow blink color and then I could save that and you can see it's already and my editor picked up that that's the color and if I go in here and give it a refresh to be sure see it picks it up too now that actually makes even more sense because now I I can still basically I can have color variables for all my entire color palette and actually let's do that this is the color palette for Franciscan University so let's get rid of I didn't want to there we go I actually changed the yellow to make it a bit darker so it's different I'm pulling these from the from the style guide I have it opened on my other screen so yeah I don't I don't know if I think I've shown you this before so this is a style guide I made us at some point last year this was the first thing I think I ever successfully built in react and I think this was done with I can't remember if I did this with create react app or with next I think I tried it with both I don't remember what I ended up going with but anyway it's not it's certainly not up to date with some of what I've been doing lately but you could at least see like some of the colors and the ideas of like the direction that I wanted to go with this so it probably wouldn't be too much work to get this up to date but until now I haven't no one except for for me and like one other person that I work with has ever even needed to reference this so it hasn't been a really high priority but anyway that's where I got the colors from and so like potentially then all I would have to do is put in like let's say F us dark blue in here and then it would change automatically everywhere that I've used link color so it could save a ton of time alright so let me get rid of this download text why haven't I taking that out yet let's get rid of that there's my title card too let's see okay not bad need to do the same thing for PSD as well I'm still not 100% sure whether I'll keep JPEG and PSD or whether I'll go back to the old web in print we'll see I'm not sure what do you all think people are used to having it's a web in print instead of select web print or the options in reality they have the option to get a JPEG version of the image and a PSD version should I switch it up because it's more accurate or should I leave it like this I mean I guess this is just a more technical way of describing it this is just describing what you would use it for you're not really sure but I mean it's not it wouldn't necessarily always be for web if they wanted to put it into like a PowerPoint that's not really a web but you could you'd still want to use this and not a PSD all right so last thing I'm gonna do I think yeah last thing I'm going to do is I'm just gonna put the an icon here as well and then we'll we'll commit this and then I'll get to all the questions so if you have questions put them in there or start thinking of them now because I'll get to them on probably about five minutes all right so let's see let's take this see if this works without me having to put parentheses around it where did I put that Oh inside masonry I'll shoot now I'm confused and this up here at least makes more sense area I mean here I should've added this span I see I mean I'm probably making this more complicated but yeah then I should have but the idea was maybe I ought to make this into a component that I can pass in this text too and then there would be a lot more clean and I wouldn't have to have all this SVG stuff in here twice does that make sense okay Patrick said or just use the component that material you I already gives you four file download icon well that's I tried to figure out what that component was earlier and I couldn't I couldn't get it to work so let's see oh actually no you're right there was one that you just had to put the SVG a stuff in my mistake I forgot about that one okay yes so let's see what do we need SVG icon that is a great idea alright so bringing that in and then let's bring in yeah I could use that I do want it to I didn't want to be able to pass in the text there's something I can I can do that maybe I can maybe I'm just not looking right okay what I'm still gonna pull this in all right let's see if that works oops left an extra span in there it was even in red I don't know how I missed that one all right let's check that out okay yet I mean it worked it's just not giving me the correct color let's see why I guess it's actually added the color in it's what they probably want me to pass the color and yeah oh this this ruins all my efforts over here to have to pass this color and I almost want to just put important on the end so I don't have to change it but I'll do it like this so let's add color and there we go and then let's do the same thing here but then let's there we go all right now now we have our download icons okay not bad that looks a little bit more legit all right cool let me commit this and then we'll do some questionandanswer stuff here to finish up get this one in all right so looks like there's a lot in the live chat so I'm gonna scroll up to where I left off and try to get through as much as I can so since there's so much I'm again I'm not definitely not gonna read everything out so I'm just gonna focus on the questions most especially on questions from people who are newer I definitely want to help them to feel welcome not that I don't appreciate all of you that that are here frequently all right all right so that's the all up on github now awesome okay all right so found where I left off at oh it looks like at some point Joshua could not hear the stream so sorry I see that at the time so I'm not sure what the issue is it looks like it doesn't look like anyone else was having the same issue so anyway that I guess let me know if that was ever resolved and if you found out what the problem was I'm not sure if it was anything on my end but if it was I definitely want to know about it so I can fix it okay I do want to read this it says John Anson said Jesse styled components dotcom keeps your JSX code clean because you don't mess it up with CSS classes you build a CSS component and style it style that and CSS it nests just like s CSS next project yeah actually that sounds cool definitely check that out for the next project remind me if I forget though if if you're around cuz I'm not sure how much longer this project will take I'm thinking actually just to give you an update I'm thinking this project may end up being like another two weeks or so not that it would take us that long to complete it cuz it probably wouldn't but it's probably gonna take that long for me to get feedback so I did we had a department meeting this morning and I did tell everyone that we need to figure out what exactly we want to update and change in this and so I need everyone's feedback so I'm just not really sure I mean you know everyone's busy they all have their own things going on so it's probably not gonna be high on anyone's priority list so I will keep reminding everyone but really it's not like we can't launch this without the changes but it would just be good to know about them and do the changes before we finish because it could possibly save us from doing some work that we may end up either getting rid of or changing so anyway so my prediction is at least two more weeks I didn't really think we'd be working on it for that long but there's been a lot of really nice improvements to this project and a lot of extra things that are really great to have like all the testing that was I was not anticipating that but I'm glad that we have it now actually patrick said pretty sure that's what he used in the last project yeah now that you say that you're right I think that was called installed components I didn't even remember it I was reading through it yeah I think it was yeah I just remember the tag that I had to use was style and then I would have a space and then I read JSX and that was the tag so I guess that was style Cantona's not sure I remember what it was called but I still remember how to how to use it so I guess that's more important okay so skillful mess asks how do you install react Sebastian says npm install' save react yeah you can definitely install react like that if you're just getting started with react though I think probably using create react app would be the best way to go so look up create react app go to their github repo and then follow the instructions there so it just depends on your skill level right so create react app is going to do a lot of things for you to get you started so that you can get right to the react and don't have to worry about webpack so I'm not not really sure what your skill level is in terms of web pack but maybe you might want to go with something like that or next Jes also does a similar thing okay Sebastian I just saw your comment about making the buttons off each occupy half the width of the cards alright maybe I'll try that and see how that looks Wow okay so skillful mess is nine years old Wow that's awesome that you're you're able to code and follow you know follow this kind of stuff at 9 years old so that's great I'm gonna say the same thing I said to Joshua who was 10 years old as if you get a chance please let me know what what it's like what your motivation is like for coding and how you got into it at such a young age because I said I have an 8 year old that I'd love to try to get him interested in coding skillful messes you should do a series of the reddit programming challenges actually we have someone doing programming stuff challenges from reddit I believe it's from reddit on the this channel already so shoot what is it called I can't remember what the title was is called we have to look it up I can't believe I have to look it up I see it constantly the daily programmer that's it so the the series the daily programmer on this channel free code camp channel is is exactly that so so check that out I'm I do not have time right now to do another series and in fact the only reason I can eat have time to do this is because it's I'm doing my normal work otherwise it would be it would be really difficult to do something with this this many hours every day consistently okay cool I just saw Brian ahead commented the separation line with the link colors works well just don't think the plain black text makes enough of a distinction and we're talking about this here so that just reminded me that I did not leave that line in so I'll probably end up putting that back in at some point because I think I think that did make a nice distinction so maybe I like to see it on more than just one does I just tested on one to see what I think but what it really looks like but I think that was kind of a nice nice distinction than them just kind of sitting there okay I'm over halfway through the live chat now so probably just not too much longer till I get to the bottom so if you have any questions that you haven't put in here yet I probably only have a few more minutes Oh Patrick I just saw your comment about the file download icon being included already oh Rohan says how does it do circular hover animations where I'm not sure where it's doing the circular hover I mean it does like the the little ripple effect when clicking so I'm not I'm not exactly sure ever on if you're which hover animation you're referring to Emerson as does anyone know how to make the dev tools look black yeah so it looks like okay someone already answered so just for anyone watching later on they can't see the live chat it's really easy for dev tool so you go into dev tools like you normally would go up here to the icon for the menu into settings and then theme will be right up there at the top and you can pick the darker the light theme and obviously I picked the dark theme and that's it it's so super easy comes builtin Alexander I see now that you're trying to tell me to put the styles on the SVG and not the span and so yeah you were definitely right so I didn't see that sooner qsk i is the name says why is there no super chat I've never tried using the super chat so from what I understand the super chat is just if you want to get money from your stream so I'm currently not interested in getting money for this stream so I haven't tried super chat if there's some other reason why I should be using super chat let me know but I I thought it was just if you wanted money Isaiah says I'm having trouble deploying my portfolio react router website to github pages help okay Isaiah's if you use create react app for it check out Gavin's pull request on my project says Gavin just did the same thing for this project that I'm working on and it was maybe pull requests 35 somewhere around there so check out the closed pool request I think it's the whatever the last one from Gavin was if you follow those steps of how he did things it should work if you didn't use create react react app I'm not really sure I guess I'd have to check out how you did things but create react app the documentation on the github repo does have a section for how exactly how to get it to work on github pages okay when I asked you all about what to do what words I should use hear JPEG PSD or whether I should put web and print so some of the ideas here Gavin says keep what they are used to in my opinion okay Ron says go with web and print if people are used to it Curtis says leave it brian says JPEG PSD that tells me exactly what I'm getting I usually think of a print logo as some sort of vector format John Hanson says JPEG PSD it looks like we're pretty split ok rhoann says maybe you could do screen and print actually yeah that would be more accurate than web and print yeah maybe I like that idea yeah okay I think about that screen if I do change it from JPEG and PSD I think I'll probably go with screen and print instead of web and print David said you should define the palette in another file and then import it and the others at CSS files yes that's that's definitely what I which should be done I was just kind of thought it might be cool to just demonstrate it so I just did it all right here but obviously cuz I'm not even using these yet but yeah ideally since I have lots of different sass files I would want to have let's say my own sass file that I could call like palette or colors or whatever I wanted to I could even call it variables if I I could have other things besides colors in there and then any time I was going to use one of those variables I could just include it I could import it at the top and then have access to it in these other files so that that would be the better way to go so I'll probably do that whenever I work on the next page where I need to use these then I'll probably pull them out and do it properly Bryan says do they have vector formats of those logos I always prefer prefer vector yeah it's actually surprisingly like somewhat not straightforward to get different logo formats around here so I agree I prefer the vector formats so if I can get them I'll try to get them but it's not like I've requested them before and then been given like JPEGs so I'm not really sure what what's up with that but usually I just kind of let it go and but but I'm with you there the vector versions of the logos would be ideal okay Sebastian I saw Sebastian mentioned again when it wouldn't look better if each button occupied half the card with with the with centreline text I'll try it out Alexander says the top row navigation and logos page is not looking good on mobile will you fix that yes so the idea is so right right now this to give everyone an idea right yeah it looks terrible it's really bad the idea is to change this into a select input or I could drop down menu once it gets to a certain so probably I don't want it to drop onto two lines so probably really early on it's going to go to a dropdown maybe I could probably do with a little bit less space between these and it would still work but at some point it'll go to a drop down mine blocks coder says I like your free code camp website Jessie actually like the the free code camp website is not it's not a really mine so I just volunteer and do this for free code camp there's a lot of other people that volunteer and do other things and that it worked on the website and so I I haven't actually contributed at all to the free code camp website although that would be cool to do someday for now I'm just just on these videos but thanks though okay alright so I've gotten to the end of the chat I've got through all the questions still got a few few suggestions and you could try out on on this but definitely looking better than it did at the beginning and we learned how to use SVG's within material UI and to utilize their SVG icon component so that was pretty cool like what else yeah I mean other than that I mean use some basic stuff but I learned a little bit about sass along the way so not bad not a bad job if I haven't looked at the time in quite a while but oh yeah almost two and a half hours for today's stream so a good time to wrap it up thanks so much for everybody that stuck around we still have people still watching after two and half hours so thank you thank you all for watching and you know everybody that's gonna watch this later on and I really appreciate it I I'll be back tomorrow tomorrow's gonna be a weird time I have a meeting scheduled at 230 and then I also have a doctor's appointment at 1030 so Oh sometime tomorrow morning I'll put on YouTube and then on Twitter when I'm gonna strain I really want to stream tomorrow it might end up having to be a short stream at a weird time but depending on how long my doctor's appointment is maybe I can do a stream from like 100 to 200 Eastern Time that seems like that that might be doable but I'll let you know tomorrow so anyway thanks again for watching and for all your help in the live stream and for the pool requests and it's just it's just overwhelmingly generous of you oh I really appreciate it and I'll be back tomorrow have a great day
