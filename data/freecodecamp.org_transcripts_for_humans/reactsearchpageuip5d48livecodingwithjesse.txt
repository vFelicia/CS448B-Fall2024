00:05 - hey everyone welcome to live coding with
00:07 - jesse i'm jesse
00:09 - and today
00:10 - we're gonna
00:11 - do some ui work so we're gonna try to
00:15 - stay as close as we can within material
00:18 - design principles
00:21 - and
00:24 - uh we're working on this search page so
00:27 - i've been looking at
00:29 - probably what's the most well-known
00:32 - search page with lots of filters
00:35 - and that is
00:36 - amazon search
00:38 - a well-known search in general probably
00:40 - be google's search page
00:43 - but i think for our use case we're going
00:46 - to have filters that are closer to what
00:48 - amazon uses so
00:50 - we can take some
00:52 - inspiration from google search page as
00:54 - well
00:56 - but
00:57 - at least for the desktop version
01:01 - i think we're going to be better off
01:02 - going with something similar to what
01:04 - amazon uses
01:07 - uh even even the mobile as well
01:09 - i think the way amazon has done it is
01:13 - pretty nice
01:18 - so
01:19 - on my other screen i'm trying to get
01:21 - these examples up of
01:26 - what
01:27 - what both amazon and google do
01:30 - for their search uh filters and
01:35 - sorting
01:43 - uh for some reason it's not let me
01:45 - resize this window here we go
01:51 - hmm
02:01 - okay
02:03 - let me
02:10 - let me get ngrok started
02:12 - for you all so if you're not familiar
02:14 - with ngrok
02:16 - this is going to allow
02:18 - all of you
02:19 - to use this link to see the website
02:22 - that's being hosted locally you can
02:24 - inspect it
02:26 - in your own dev tools you know on your
02:29 - own machine as we're going so that's in
02:31 - the live chat i'll probably paste it
02:32 - again in a few minutes as more people
02:34 - join
02:35 - looks like we have
02:36 - yeah we have about our average uh number
02:38 - of viewers in here now so
02:41 - i'm going to switch my screen and get
02:43 - started
02:48 - uh i do want to let you all know
02:51 - especially those of you who watch my
02:52 - last stream uh that i tried to do at
02:55 - home and the quality wasn't too great
02:57 - that i did upgrade my internet service
02:59 - to the highest level i could possibly
03:01 - get at my my house and
03:05 - i'm hoping that'll help and i also
03:07 - messed around with a lot of the settings
03:09 - i looked at what a bunch of other people
03:10 - were doing
03:12 - i had some help
03:14 - um so you know like the youtube
03:16 - um
03:18 - live stream
03:19 - or the uh 24 7
03:22 - uh
03:23 - free code camp music stream that's going
03:26 - now so the guy who does that uh pretty
03:28 - matthew
03:30 - i think his name is matthew i hope i
03:32 - didn't get that wrong uh but matthew
03:34 - worked with me for like an hour we were
03:36 - trying to figure it out so
03:39 - i've done all that i think i can at this
03:41 - point to try to get it to work so
03:42 - hopefully the next time i try to do it
03:44 - from home
03:45 - which may be tomorrow or sometime next
03:47 - week it will work i'm aiming to get 720p
03:51 - resolution i think that'll be high
03:53 - enough so that everyone can see the font
03:56 - i don't really think it'd be possible
03:57 - for my current setup to get higher than
03:59 - 720p
04:02 - so
04:04 - i'm hopeful for that
04:06 - i really would would want to have a
04:08 - better quality for you all
04:12 - also
04:13 - i'm working on a project
04:15 - let's get this
04:17 - let's get our ui started
04:19 - uh should we do
04:22 - you know normally we do a mobile first
04:24 - one but i think i'd rather start off
04:27 - with a desktop
04:29 - search
04:31 - because the mobile first one is going to
04:33 - add the mobile version of our search is
04:35 - going to add a bit more complexity
04:38 - and
04:39 - i don't know that i want to deal with
04:41 - that right now i think it'd be better to
04:42 - go with the more simple one and then add
04:45 - the complexity of having drop downs and
04:47 - things
04:50 - so that's what we'll do
04:53 - so any i'm working on a new project if
04:56 - anyone is interested let me know i'll
04:58 - have a get up repo up soon
05:00 - but i i put some details on twitter
05:03 - yesterday or the day before or so
05:06 - and
05:08 - i bought
05:09 - a a brain computer interface headset so
05:12 - i don't know if you all have ever seen
05:13 - this but
05:14 - uh you put this headset on it's kind of
05:16 - like headphones uh and it it monitors
05:19 - your your brain activity your brain
05:21 - waves
05:23 - and um
05:25 - you can tell
05:27 - you know certain things about what's
05:28 - going on in the brain like
05:30 - are you more relaxed uh
05:32 - or you know are you more focused uh
05:35 - things like that
05:36 - so
05:39 - my son
05:40 - uh my oldest son who's eight years old
05:42 - he has obsessive-compulsive disorder or
05:44 - he has some issues where you know he'll
05:46 - just like get he gets himself all worked
05:48 - up about something and if it gets bad
05:50 - enough he just like he can't get out of
05:53 - this uh this mentality where he's just
05:55 - so frustrated and upset
05:57 - so my idea is that i'm going to take
05:59 - those brain waves
06:01 - and i'm going to use some of the work
06:03 - that alex castillo has been doing
06:06 - so uh you could check out alex on his
06:09 - alex castillo dot io uh check him out on
06:11 - twitter you know he's been at a bunch of
06:13 - conferences but he's done a lot of work
06:15 - with being able to interpret the signal
06:18 - from those uh headsets
06:20 - and
06:21 - and bring it in
06:23 - and manipulate use that for with
06:25 - javascript so basically pull it into a
06:27 - website or a web app
06:30 - so i'd like to do that same thing and
06:32 - alex has actually offered to help me
06:34 - with this which is awesome
06:37 - and i want to bring it into a very
06:38 - simple javascript game
06:41 - that's going to help my son
06:44 - recognize when his brain is starting to
06:46 - get into that pattern where it's he's
06:48 - gonna get all worked up
06:50 - to recognize that early enough so he can
06:52 - get himself out of that and also to help
06:54 - him train his brain to be able to get
06:56 - himself out of that to calm down so the
06:58 - idea is just very loose right now but
07:00 - the idea of the game is that certain
07:02 - mechanics in the game are going to be
07:04 - based on
07:06 - his his brain activity
07:08 - so
07:09 - in order to
07:11 - move forward in the game and progress
07:13 - he'll have to successfully calm himself
07:15 - down
07:17 - so there's going to be a lot of fine
07:18 - tuning that's going to happen i know
07:21 - there's definitely got to be a balance
07:23 - between like
07:25 - making the game um
07:28 - challenging enough so that it actually
07:30 - does give him incentive and train him to
07:33 - you know help correct his thought
07:34 - patterns
07:36 - but it also can't be too challenging
07:37 - that it actually would make him more
07:39 - frustrated
07:41 - so he does get really frustrated with
07:43 - video games if if he keeps like losing
07:45 - and losing so
07:46 - it's gonna probably take a long time but
07:48 - i think if it could work
07:50 - it could be really helpful for my son
07:52 - but potentially helpful for other people
07:54 - who are dealing with mental health
07:56 - issues
07:58 - especially with kids adults have a much
08:00 - easier time verbalizing what they're
08:03 - thinking
08:04 - but kids especially when my son was
08:06 - younger
08:07 - you just never knew what was going on in
08:08 - his head he didn't know how to explain
08:11 - what he was experiencing
08:13 - so i'm thinking that
08:15 - this may help
08:17 - so
08:18 - i'm going to start with start with my
08:20 - son
08:21 - and
08:22 - see how it goes so
08:25 - anyway
08:26 - i'll probably give you you know updates
08:28 - on this as it goes on you know i may
08:29 - even live stream some of the work on it
08:31 - record some of the results uh because i
08:34 - think
08:35 - i mean other people might be interested
08:37 - and you know other people that maybe are
08:38 - way more experienced than me might be
08:40 - interested and might be able to do more
08:41 - with the project and help more people so
08:44 - anyway
08:46 - enough with that project let's get to
08:47 - our project uh that that we're working
08:50 - on today
08:52 - and that is
08:56 - this search page so today what we're
08:59 - going to do is just take these filters
09:01 - that we have here
09:03 - and this sorting
09:04 - and we're just going to move it over
09:07 - we're gonna move it to the side so let's
09:08 - see what side
09:14 - left side or right side
09:21 - i don't really know i don't know whether
09:22 - we should do left or right
09:31 - if any as one has any opinion on that
09:33 - let me know otherwise i guess we'll just
09:34 - start on
09:38 - the right side
09:45 - yeah
09:48 - so essentially this this section here
09:50 - will be split into
09:53 - um
09:54 - let's say a fourth of it or a third of
09:56 - it will be filters and then the rest
09:58 - will be search results
10:04 - okay james saying right side
10:09 - okay we can try that
10:13 - all right so let's get this into
10:15 - position first we'll kind of
10:17 - fill out you know this basic grid that
10:19 - we'll have that'll keep these in their
10:21 - right sections
10:22 - and uh we could probably determine like
10:25 - at what point we need to switch to a
10:26 - mobile view
10:30 - and then
10:34 - then we'll go uh
10:36 - get like kind of a little bit more
10:37 - detailed with fixing padding and things
10:40 - like that
10:44 - sorry
10:45 - sorry about the on
10:49 - okay
10:52 - all right so uh some of you are
10:54 - commenting here on on this
10:56 - um
10:59 - michael says won't be able to stay till
11:00 - i see what you intend
11:02 - all right fair enough yeah it's i have
11:04 - an image in my head but of course you
11:06 - all can't see that so
11:08 - james asks a great question how many
11:10 - check boxes will there be eventually
11:13 - there may end up being quite a few
11:17 - yeah definitely more than three
11:19 - so let me let me pull over
11:23 - uh from amazon here
11:27 - let me pull this over under the screen
11:30 - so you all can see kind of what
11:32 - what they're doing and so so you can see
11:34 - what i have in my mind a bit
11:37 - so
11:38 - i just did a search for a webcam because
11:40 - i'm i'm looking for a better webcam for
11:43 - streaming
11:44 - but
11:47 - they have
11:50 - their refined by section here
11:55 - and you can click on these different
11:56 - things but they have them and we may end
11:59 - up having to do this as well to help the
12:02 - user
12:04 - they have them in these little
12:05 - subsections
12:07 - and
12:09 - depending on how many
12:11 - filtering options we end up having that
12:15 - that might be
12:16 - a better way to go so something similar
12:19 - to this
12:20 - and then amazon puts their sort by up
12:23 - here
12:26 - i mean that's a possibility
12:29 - if that's what you where a user would
12:30 - expect it to be and instead of with the
12:33 - filters then i'm open to that
12:39 - um
12:43 - and then the search bar
12:47 - i do kind of want to keep the search bar
12:49 - like maybe at the top so maybe something
12:52 - more like
12:53 - search bar where it is except with
12:55 - better padding and not completely across
12:57 - the entire screen filters next to the
13:00 - search bar
13:03 - or i'm sorry the sorting next to the
13:05 - search bar and then filters down one of
13:08 - the sides
13:17 - oh cool when nikki says the uh logitech
13:20 - 920
13:21 - is often used for stream streaming so
13:24 - yeah i think i was looking at one of
13:26 - these
13:27 - 920 models
13:30 - so there's some of them i'm just trying
13:32 - to determine like what how good do i
13:35 - need it to be
13:37 - uh for for streaming because some of
13:40 - them are
13:41 - there's one that's
13:43 - you can stream
13:44 - you can record 4k
13:46 - and things like that i definitely don't
13:49 - you all don't need to see my face in 4k
13:51 - i'm pretty sure
14:00 - let's see all right michael says
14:03 - uh those aren't searches though the
14:05 - choices
14:06 - anyway when you start inputting in
14:08 - search bar brings up choices for
14:10 - departments
14:12 - um
14:20 - logitech has a gold box today on
14:22 - logitech
14:23 - all right i'm getting a lot of input on
14:26 - the um
14:27 - webcam okay so i'm not going to read it
14:28 - right now i'm going to wait and read it
14:30 - after
14:32 - let me start this pomodoro timer so we
14:33 - can get to work after 25 minutes i'm
14:35 - going to go back to the live chat and
14:36 - answer any questions that you you all
14:38 - may have put in there
14:41 - um
14:42 - and we can talk more about webcams then
14:46 - uh but right now
14:47 - [Music]
14:51 - let's start with the search bar all
14:52 - right we'll start with the first things
14:54 - that we're gonna have on the page and
14:55 - we'll work our way down so it'll be
14:57 - search bar first
14:59 - filter second
15:00 - i'm sorry i keep mixing these up forget
15:03 - what i just said search bar first
15:07 - sorting second over here
15:11 - and then filters
15:13 - somewhere on one of these sides
15:18 - all right so
15:19 - let's go into our our file first
15:23 - you can check out
15:27 - the
15:28 - where the search.js file so you can
15:31 - check out the github repo
15:33 - if you like the
15:35 - description
15:37 - for this video should have a link to the
15:39 - repository
15:42 - and
15:44 - let's go down to where we have that
15:45 - input
15:47 - here it is here's our search input
15:52 - and we haven't used the material design
15:54 - style
15:56 - for testing we just threw in a regular
15:58 - input so the first thing we're going to
16:00 - want to do is go to the
16:02 - material ui documentation
16:07 - and we're going to grab some code from
16:09 - there to be able to use this input we
16:11 - are up unless material ui came out with
16:14 - a new beta
16:15 - update within the last two days we are
16:18 - completely up to date so i did merge
16:20 - that other branch into master
16:22 - and i found out after i restarted the
16:25 - server
16:27 - i did find some things that broke in the
16:29 - ui
16:30 - so basically
16:32 - almost everything was fixed by me
16:34 - changing type to variant
16:39 - that was
16:40 - most of the work if you want to see
16:41 - specifically what i change go check the
16:44 - last few commits
16:47 - and that should give you an idea of what
16:50 - it takes to upgrade to the latest
16:52 - version of material ui
16:54 - uh in terms of dealing with braking
16:57 - changes luckily a lot of the braking
16:59 - changes dealt with components that we
17:00 - didn't even use
17:03 - so that was good for us
17:05 - so we should have this open
17:08 - material ui
17:09 - nope those are the icons
17:12 - there we are i always have a material ui
17:14 - window open somewhere
17:16 - okay so this is material uinext.com
17:20 - so we're using the latest beta version
17:23 - and actually
17:25 - let's refresh this
17:27 - see if we get the
17:29 - newest version
17:34 - what i refreshed it now i can't use this
17:37 - sidebar
17:38 - what is going on
17:41 - there we are okay beta 38. i
17:45 - that's what we're on so we're in beta 38
17:47 - we're all up to date let's check out our
17:51 - components
17:53 - and
17:54 - what do we have inputs
17:59 - text fields there we are
18:01 - okay so we're going to want a text field
18:05 - here's a search field
18:08 - i guess we could check out the code for
18:10 - the search field
18:12 - we're definitely going to need to bring
18:14 - in a text field
18:16 - so let's pull that in right now we'll
18:18 - bring in this import let me zoom in a
18:21 - bit so you all can see
18:23 - so we're importing text field
18:30 - and then
18:32 - we're also going to bring in
18:36 - uh
18:37 - we'll figure out what styles we need
18:40 - let's see textview
18:44 - yeah let's just pull in this text field
18:46 - styles we're probably going to need
18:48 - those
18:51 - and
18:55 - put um
19:00 - let's put them here
19:03 - as of right now my
19:05 - my organization for our styles object is
19:10 - basically just in the order that these
19:12 - elements appear on the page
19:15 - might not be the best way to do it but
19:18 - uh it it's working right now
19:21 - okay now let's find that
19:26 - let's see
19:28 - we already have our our handle change so
19:32 - we're good with that
19:42 - search
19:43 - there we are
19:49 - i'm not sure right now what is different
19:51 - about the search field it looks pretty
19:53 - much the same
19:56 - i guess we'll find out
19:58 - okay so we have this input now
20:00 - and at first i'm just going to put this
20:03 - in right above our current input
20:05 - so i can
20:07 - make sure that we have
20:11 - search
20:16 - type search
20:29 - all right
20:32 - uh you know what let's see
20:35 - we want this to be a controlled
20:37 - component let's see if
20:44 - let's see if that's how they're doing
20:46 - this one
21:00 - all right let's find that
21:04 - multi-line that's controlled
21:08 - where is that
21:16 - um
21:30 - i thought the last time i looked at this
21:32 - there was a version
21:35 - where they used the controlled input
21:41 - okay so it is just value here
21:47 - okay
21:48 - all right that should work then
21:52 - so we're going to add whoa not that
21:55 - uh so we're going to add this value
21:59 - here
22:00 - and we also need this
22:03 - on change
22:05 - here
22:07 - and let's get rid of this
22:10 - and see what we have
22:12 - label search
22:14 - i don't think i need that
22:22 - okay
22:32 - oh
22:35 - what is going on
22:38 - failed to save
22:42 - important text field
22:46 - what did i just do
23:10 - all right
23:11 - uh
23:12 - check check
23:23 - i don't know what just happened
23:27 - let's see if it caught our changes all
23:29 - right there we go
23:32 - text field
23:44 - i'll change your search results
23:52 - whoa
23:54 - that's not right
24:03 - i'm gonna check the live chat see if any
24:05 - of you caught what
24:06 - what i just did
24:15 - what the heck
24:28 - okay
24:30 - let's do this
24:33 - i'm going to grab this text field
24:36 - i'm going to
24:37 - copy it and throw it over here
24:41 - in our
24:43 - file of
24:44 - scraps and then
24:47 - i'm gonna go to the github report
25:01 - i'm gonna grab the original file
25:06 - so it wasn't let me undo the changes
25:08 - wonder if i can manually undo undo
25:21 - yeah i cannot do any of that
25:23 - um
25:25 - so we're gonna grab that file
25:31 - i guess i could just
25:37 - johnson i may have an extra closing
25:40 - bracket somewhere
25:51 - yeah it looks like i accidentally
25:53 - deleted some stuff
25:56 - right
25:58 - or pasted in some things that i
25:59 - shouldn't have
26:03 - i yeah i'm not exactly sure what
26:05 - happened
26:06 - so anyway i'll fix it right now
26:09 - uh i don't need any of that stuff that
26:11 - looks good so i'm just gonna copy
26:14 - um the
26:19 - let's see
26:25 - checkbox form control form control label
26:28 - checkbox
26:31 - svg
26:33 - okay so from here
26:39 - down to this second form control i think
26:41 - is what we need
26:44 - let's double check that we do have that
26:46 - classes select value
26:48 - okay
26:49 - i think that's that's it
26:57 - all right
27:06 - text field is not defined
27:13 - okay
27:15 - let's try this
27:18 - again did anybody catch what happened
27:21 - what did i do
27:28 - okay
27:30 - now let's save it
27:31 - okay successful save that time
27:35 - all right
27:38 - now
27:39 - there we are now i have a search field
27:43 - let's actually put search out there
27:46 - which
27:49 - probably not going to have it like that
27:51 - so let's do
27:53 - let's do our search for
27:55 - biology okay wonderful
28:01 - all right cool so it is it is searching
28:05 - okay maybe
28:07 - maybe since i said it was a search field
28:09 - it automatically gives me that x which
28:11 - is actually really cool
28:13 - very cool all right so we have our
28:16 - search field
28:18 - step one completed let's check our time
28:21 - 11 minutes left on our timer
28:24 - cool
28:26 - uh let's see
28:37 - okay sort by that's what we're doing now
28:40 - let's go grab all the stuff for sort by
28:43 - and first thing we're going to do is
28:44 - just move it up here
28:46 - and then once you do that then we can
28:48 - work on
28:50 - whatever else we need to make this
28:52 - look nice and be very obvious to the
28:55 - user what it's going to do
29:00 - so
29:01 - this
29:02 - was already put in i believe nikki was
29:04 - the one that that did put that in there
29:07 - so
29:09 - uh nikki already
29:11 - filled it in with the
29:13 - uh material design style
29:16 - so we won't have to worry about changing
29:18 - anything for that
29:19 - so right now
29:21 - this whole form controls like yep there
29:23 - we are
29:25 - so we're just going to take that
29:27 - and remove it from where it is we're
29:28 - going to move it up here
29:30 - above
29:39 - uh our
29:43 - we uh we're gonna move it up here but
29:45 - what we might want to do though is
29:46 - change
29:49 - change this form
29:53 - actually
29:54 - on submit
29:56 - is get form results
30:04 - we don't actually have
30:09 - a submit button there dewey
30:13 - and what is this svg
30:15 - i'm going to take this
30:18 - i'm going to take this out and this svg
30:24 - and i'm going to replace the forms
30:29 - with with this form control
30:44 - okay
30:47 - all right let's see how that looks
30:49 - whoa
30:54 - okay so now we have everything up here
30:55 - in this line
30:58 - and
31:01 - we're gonna
31:02 - i probably need to add some grid stuff
31:04 - here
31:10 - okay
31:16 - let's check out
31:18 - in material
31:20 - ui
31:22 - let's check out our layout stuff
31:26 - and see where our grid is
31:42 - i just want to see what
31:44 - okay grid container
31:46 - all right
31:53 - grid containers and grid items
31:56 - all right
31:57 - it's been a few weeks since i worked
31:58 - with this uh i just needed a refresher
32:01 - on the
32:04 - syntax
32:05 - okay
32:07 - so let's just put some containers in
32:09 - here
32:10 - uh we're definitely gonna want a
32:12 - container here and
32:15 - within the same grid container
32:18 - i want to have
32:26 - i guess we could put everything in the
32:28 - container
32:30 - let's try to put everything in one grid
32:31 - container right now
32:33 - and see if that works
32:46 - just
32:58 - oops
33:00 - that was it right grid grid yeah
33:07 - okay so we put it all in the grid
33:15 - oh john hanson has a good point here it
33:17 - says submit function in a form without a
33:20 - submit button is the enter key
33:23 - okay
33:33 - i guess that shouldn't be a problem
33:37 - since we're searching automatically
33:40 - there wouldn't really be a reason to hit
33:41 - the enter key the user could hit the
33:43 - enter key and it would seem like it
33:45 - worked anyway but because since we're
33:47 - just automatically searching
33:49 - so i guess that should be all right if
33:52 - anyone has a different reason why we
33:54 - should keep
33:55 - what we had before and let me know
33:59 - all right let's import grid as well
34:02 - um
34:18 - and as this component starts to get
34:20 - larger it's probably going to be a good
34:22 - idea to separate it out into multiple
34:25 - components
34:26 - but while we're building it we'll keep
34:28 - it all in one place once we get it to a
34:30 - place where it looks good this is you
34:32 - know pretty much what we want then we
34:33 - can separate it out
34:35 - i find as long as it's not too large
34:38 - it's easier to have it all in one spot
34:40 - while you're making it
34:42 - at least for me
34:45 - all right and i suppose let's we can
34:48 - grab this container
34:51 - do we already have a container class i
34:53 - think we do
34:55 - content container okay
35:00 - so this should work so
35:05 - let's see what it's done
35:11 - we need to add our um
35:13 - our grid items in now
35:15 - because it's going to look silly without
35:17 - it
35:18 - okay so
35:20 - we just need to add grid item and then
35:23 - we can add in our values for
35:27 - what we want
35:30 - we like how many rows we want this to
35:32 - take up
35:45 - okay
35:48 - so let's put around
36:05 - i'm just gonna put these in
36:09 - and not really worry about the values
36:11 - for now
36:13 - i just want to get it all in there
36:55 - all right
36:57 - and i apologize if i'm gonna
37:00 - be a little off today i started to get a
37:02 - headache
37:03 - i actually started to get really bad
37:04 - heartburn in a headache right before the
37:06 - stream so i took some
37:08 - uh pain medicine to try to get rid of
37:11 - the headache
37:13 - and uh it's starting to come back again
37:15 - so i'm gonna do my best
37:18 - i want to see how these
37:20 - i better type in something
37:23 - legitimate
37:24 - i want to see how these results look
37:28 - okay
37:32 - i mean this is makes sense this is
37:34 - exactly what i just told it to do
37:36 - uh
37:38 - so now let's go back
37:40 - and
37:42 - give this some legitimate values what do
37:45 - you have all right about two minutes i'm
37:47 - gonna come back to the live chat and
37:48 - answer
37:52 - answer all the questions
37:55 - for now let's go in here and give
37:59 - let's set this to 12. am i using
38:03 - let me see what i'm using am i using a
38:05 - 12
38:06 - grid
38:11 - let's inspect this for a second
38:22 - okay it looks like it is
38:26 - great
38:28 - at least for now that's
38:31 - skids we want
38:38 - all right let's go with
38:40 - let's go up here to our search bar
38:42 - uh let's give this
38:48 - um
38:49 - so out of 12
38:50 - let's give this
38:58 - nine
39:01 - and that can stay three
39:04 - and then that's down here
39:07 - let's take
39:09 - this
39:11 - grid
39:13 - and let's move it
39:18 - down below
39:20 - here
39:22 - and we'll keep this at 3
39:25 - and we'll make this
39:28 - a nine
39:31 - and that'll be all right because things
39:33 - ought to line up there we are
39:35 - so these will line up and these will
39:37 - line up
39:42 - okay
39:44 - hopefully now you see a little bit um
39:48 - a little bit more about
39:52 - what i was going for
39:54 - so the filters will be here
39:56 - right sort here so
40:00 - it doesn't really look like much right
40:01 - now i think we still have some work to
40:03 - put in for this but
40:06 - this is about what we're going if you
40:08 - think the filters would definitely look
40:10 - better on this side let me know we can
40:12 - do that
40:15 - that won't really be a problem
40:18 - for now
40:20 - uh my timer just went off so i'm going
40:22 - to take a five minute break i am gonna
40:24 - take a drink here
40:37 - so
40:39 - as always i'm drinking my g fuel
40:42 - i put up a post on uh instagram with my
40:45 - g fuel in it
40:47 - and i tag g fuel in it
40:50 - and
40:51 - i gave him a little hint that
40:54 - they got an opportunity for me to be a
40:56 - spokesperson if they want it
41:01 - so they didn't get back to me though
41:03 - not yet they you know they might be busy
41:05 - maybe they'll get back to me later this
41:06 - week
41:09 - all right
41:10 - oops let me start this
41:14 - all right so five minutes i'm gonna try
41:16 - to get through as many questions as i
41:17 - can
41:20 - all right nikki says hey excited for f1
41:23 - to start again this weekend
41:26 - cool i'm i'm not really a racing fan i'm
41:29 - not anti-racing but i just
41:33 - don't often watch it but i'm glad you're
41:35 - excited for it
41:37 - nikki says i hope daniel ricardo
41:40 - rick ricciardo
41:43 - said does well
41:45 - uh
41:46 - cool again i'm not really
41:48 - knowledgeable about racing but
41:50 - good luck daniel
41:53 - uh
41:55 - but
41:57 - matthias says hi jesse love your stuff
41:59 - keep it up thank you i appreciate that
42:02 - and i plan on keeping it up for as long
42:04 - as i can
42:05 - as long as it's beneficial to you all i
42:07 - will keep doing this
42:09 - james ross says it's the new project a
42:11 - beard
42:13 - no i've completed that project i
42:16 - that was our last project
42:20 - the beard will probably be leaving soon
42:23 - it's it's gonna start getting warmer now
42:25 - despite all the snow that that a lot of
42:27 - us got uh yesterday
42:30 - it is gonna start getting warmer and
42:32 - then beards aren't as fun
42:35 - santiago says greetings from venezuela
42:39 - uh the game sounds like a good idea oh
42:41 - thank you thank you so that was if you
42:43 - weren't here at the beginning i gave
42:44 - kind of my plan for one of my side
42:46 - projects so you can
42:49 - if you're interested in my side project
42:51 - that has to do with brain human
42:55 - interface or brain computer interfaces
42:58 - check it out uh on the recording you
43:00 - just go back and watch the first like 10
43:02 - minutes
43:04 - uh let's see
43:08 - i'm scrolling down to find some
43:10 - questions
43:15 - all right so here was some discussion
43:17 - about
43:18 - what the best
43:20 - camera is for streaming that i should
43:22 - get so if anybody has any experience
43:24 - with webcams please let me know your
43:26 - opinion uh basically the logitech 920
43:30 - series seems like something that i
43:33 - should look into
43:34 - um
43:35 - i don't
43:36 - the only thing that i ever really do is
43:38 - like
43:40 - images of me right like doing this just
43:42 - like i'm doing now
43:44 - so
43:45 - i don't know what quality i really need
43:48 - i saw one that's uh a pretty good deal
43:51 - on amazon i think it was only like 40 or
43:54 - 50 dollars
43:55 - which was discounted from the the normal
43:58 - price
43:59 - and it could do
44:01 - you can record in 1080p but you can only
44:04 - stream in 720.
44:06 - i think that would be okay
44:08 - i mean i don't
44:10 - let me know if you think that quality
44:11 - would be all right for me
44:13 - uh i
44:15 - i mean i really i'd rather not spend a
44:17 - ton of money and i don't make any money
44:18 - from streaming so
44:21 - it's it's not like an investment for me
44:23 - it's just
44:24 - would be a little bit better quality so
44:27 - anyway if you have any experience with
44:29 - webcams uh especially if you're
44:31 - streaming with them
44:33 - uh please let me know what what you all
44:35 - think is is a good one preferably one
44:37 - under a hundred dollars
44:52 - okay daniel says uh daniel frank says i
44:55 - can personally vouch for the 920 and it
44:58 - has worked in my enterprise for three
44:59 - years straight everyday use oh excellent
45:02 - that's exactly what i wanted that's
45:04 - that's really uh good advice
45:07 - uh i mean you know you
45:09 - you can read all you want online you can
45:11 - read reviews but it's much better to
45:13 - like really talk to somebody who knows
45:14 - so uh i appreciate that daniel
45:26 - oh michael says about search bar stuff i
45:28 - like the amazon drop down incorporated
45:31 - into the search bar
45:33 - then the autofill entries into the
45:36 - search results not sure how hard that is
45:40 - in react
45:47 - okay so is that
45:49 - somewhat like what we're what we're
45:50 - doing that the filters are kind of with
45:54 - the search results and then the drop
45:56 - down is kind of with the
45:58 - i know it's not as closely with it as on
46:01 - amazon but i think that's a bit what
46:02 - we're going with that general idea
46:13 - michael says or to save space especially
46:15 - on mobile have a multi-select drop down
46:17 - that autofills with returned available
46:20 - filters
46:21 - yeah that's what i'm planning on doing
46:23 - on mobile so definitely
46:25 - basically the only thing you'll see
46:26 - right off the bat on mobile is the
46:28 - search field everything else will be in
46:31 - a drop down
46:36 - yeah it'll be in a
46:38 - multi-select drop down
46:40 - maybe i'll have the sort by in its own
46:44 - drop down
46:45 - as well i don't
46:47 - i don't want to get too crazy and have
46:49 - too much stuff uh you know because the
46:51 - mobile
46:52 - you only have limited space on mobile so
46:54 - we'll see how much space we can get but
46:56 - that's basically what i'm uh what i was
46:58 - thinking i'm going with
47:01 - okay
47:02 - i
47:03 - am almost
47:05 - to the bottom of the live chat so
47:10 - let me see i don't think there's that
47:11 - many questions left
47:13 - uh
47:15 - so i may go ahead even though my timer
47:17 - went off i might try to get just these
47:18 - last few
47:20 - just don't want to keep you all waiting
47:21 - with for the answers for too long
47:25 - let's see
47:33 - uh jason lee asks what's the timers for
47:35 - is this a freelance project the timer is
47:38 - just to break up our time here so that i
47:40 - don't spend too much time talking or too
47:42 - much time coding
47:44 - we get a nice kind of break in between i
47:46 - also use the pomodoro timer just to
47:48 - break up my day it's not a freelance
47:51 - project this is uh i'm a front-end
47:53 - developer i work full-time
47:57 - salary for a university
48:16 - ah let's see
48:22 - software dev says it is interesting that
48:24 - you've got tags like grid control and
48:26 - form control is that precompiled in
48:28 - normal html tags and the javascript is
48:31 - within the html
48:34 - all right nikki says it's not really
48:35 - html just looks like it all right so
48:37 - this is a good segue back into the code
48:39 - here so let's um
48:42 - let's go over this
48:49 - yeah let me go over this now then so let
48:51 - me start our our coding timer and the
48:53 - first thing we'll do is just kind of do
48:54 - a quick recap of what we've done
48:57 - to go over some of these these tags so
48:59 - software dev is asking about these tags
49:02 - so
49:03 - um basically
49:05 - if you're not and i'm not assuming
49:08 - software dev that you're not familiar
49:09 - with react but anybody out there that's
49:11 - not that familiar with react all of this
49:14 - here looks a lot like html but it's
49:16 - actually not it's it's jsx and what this
49:20 - is is is syntactic sugar on top of
49:23 - javascript functions to create dom
49:26 - elements
49:28 - uh so really what what these will break
49:32 - down into is a javascript function
49:35 - that's going to create
49:37 - a select field and create these items
49:39 - within these select fields but that's
49:41 - really hard to write if you're used to
49:43 - html it's kind of a pain to write all
49:45 - these functions like uh think of like
49:47 - continually writing like
49:48 - document.creator or uh get element by id
49:52 - or create it yeah you know what i'm
49:53 - saying it's it's a lot
49:55 - so this makes it easier that we can
49:57 - write basically what looks and acts
50:00 - pretty much like normal html so when we
50:02 - write things like this like this grid
50:05 - it ends up turning into something else
50:07 - so we can see what it turns into here
50:14 - uh so
50:16 - we have this div with a class of mui
50:20 - grid right the classes are
50:23 - get kind of crazy
50:25 - but and within it we have a field set
50:27 - all right we have a legend a div labels
50:31 - spans
50:32 - more spans
50:34 - svgs
50:35 - inputs right so all of that comes from
50:39 - just adding in in that case the select
50:42 - and these menu items within within this
50:45 - or i'm sorry that was the check boxes
50:46 - we're looking at from just adding in
50:48 - this grid form control form labels and
50:51 - check boxes
50:52 - okay so
50:54 - each one of these is a separate
50:56 - component that exists in a separate
50:59 - javascript file somewhere within our
51:00 - project and in particular most of these
51:04 - exist within the material
51:06 - ui uh
51:10 - package so it's it's in our node modules
51:12 - folder
51:14 - so
51:15 - yeah so it doesn't exactly behave like
51:17 - normal html
51:19 - and there's a lot more to it obviously
51:22 - but it's kind of hidden away and it lets
51:24 - us
51:25 - you know have markup that's that's
51:27 - cleaner
51:29 - and we can still have control over it by
51:31 - passing in these properties so these
51:33 - props will change things and give us
51:35 - some versatility for those components
51:39 - so hopefully that was
51:40 - a decent explanation of
51:44 - a little bit of how react works
51:47 - and hopefully it answered your question
51:48 - if it didn't let me know and then after
51:50 - this pomodoro session then i can go back
51:53 - and
51:54 - try to do a better job
52:00 - okay so if i didn't get to your question
52:01 - right now i will get it to it at the end
52:03 - i know there were a few there at the
52:04 - bottom that i didn't get to
52:08 - and
52:09 - okay so let's
52:13 - let's work on these
52:15 - uh let's move the label for sort by up
52:17 - because right now this this looks kind
52:19 - of odd side by side
52:21 - so we have the labels kind of opposite
52:23 - so
52:25 - let's just switch that around now should
52:27 - be something easy
52:28 - and
52:29 - i think it'll look a lot nicer
52:32 - let's
52:33 - deform upper text
52:36 - let's put that
52:40 - up here
52:41 - see what that does for us
52:45 - there we are
52:46 - we still have
52:49 - some padding issues here let's see what
52:51 - what's going on
52:54 - so right now we have our
52:57 - grid container our grid item form
53:00 - control
53:01 - the text field must be what has the
53:03 - extra padding because
53:05 - right we have grid form control
53:09 - here right so it's the same let's see
53:11 - what kind
53:12 - of class text field let's see what we
53:15 - have going on here on our on our text
53:17 - field
53:18 - styles
53:22 - with margin left marching right with
53:24 - okay we don't have any extra
53:26 - margins or paddings
53:28 - margin or padding happening okay
53:34 - all right
53:35 - let's
53:36 - then look look into uh devtools and see
53:39 - what's going on
53:42 - okay
53:43 - form control
53:44 - the form control here
53:49 - oh let's see
53:50 - do we have a difference here
53:54 - all right this form control
53:57 - it is giving us class name form
54:00 - interesting
54:06 - so this
54:08 - has a in a div within the normal form
54:12 - control div
54:18 - that says page text field
54:21 - so let's check out here
54:23 - what we have going on
54:27 - and we don't have that happening here
54:33 - okay
54:43 - all right let's see
54:47 - all right michael's saying isn't the
54:48 - search field text built into the search
54:51 - element
54:52 - is the select a material ui element
54:56 - i thought it was a material let me
54:58 - double check
54:59 - yeah that's definitely a mature ui
55:01 - element
55:04 - so that's not default select behavior
55:07 - um
55:10 - okay let's see
55:28 - all right so the style of that margin
55:36 - that's this 16 pixel margin here
55:41 - and 8 at the bottom
55:43 - and that's coming from
55:45 - margin normal
55:50 - so why don't we have that it's just it
55:53 - entirely
55:57 - not creating another
56:00 - it's it's creating this item type
56:04 - that's really odd
56:18 - hmm
56:22 - that's really odd
56:26 - all right john hanson is saying add a
56:28 - line items baseline on that wrapping div
56:32 - okay we'll try it out in devtools first
56:36 - and
56:36 - we should have
56:46 - there we go
57:11 - all right not making a difference
57:16 - um
57:25 - the furthest div
57:27 - she's saying this this whole container
57:44 - okay
57:46 - all right let's shout out then
57:51 - whoa baseline
57:53 - okay so all right so we have a line
57:55 - items baseline going now
57:57 - [Music]
58:00 - and then
58:21 - oh why is it doing this now
58:38 - so we have this gap right here
58:41 - why do we have this gap
58:48 - css is a fun mystery
58:50 - sometimes
58:55 - all right where's my gap coming from
59:18 - all right is there any difference here
59:38 - we have this align items on here but
59:40 - that's about it
59:49 - uh john asked if i took out that first
59:51 - baseline that i had it i was that's what
59:53 - i was thinking and i think it was here
59:55 - and i must have accidentally set it to
59:56 - left but that's it i mean it's
59:59 - that was where i added it in so it's
60:00 - gone now
60:20 - it's just weird
60:24 - anyone have any idea why
60:26 - why it's doing this
60:32 - excuse me i'm gonna get another drink
60:33 - here
60:34 - while i ponder this problem
60:55 - okay
61:00 - hmm
61:02 - let's play with
61:04 - um
61:07 - let's play with this
61:48 - all right baseline center looks pretty
61:50 - good obviously
61:52 - these don't this doesn't look good and
61:55 - this looks okay right now but if there
61:57 - were only a few items it would
62:00 - take it down
62:01 - well i guess it
62:03 - it would show up in the middle so that
62:04 - wouldn't look good but what we can do is
62:10 - we could change
62:13 - it might be easier to just do it on here
62:16 - let's let's try this for a second let's
62:18 - take out this align item center here
62:21 - and then
62:23 - how do we do it uh
62:27 - align
62:29 - align self
62:32 - center
62:34 - okay so
62:35 - uh if you're using flexbox
62:38 - which i believe the grid system is
62:42 - uh
62:42 - this grid system and material ui is
62:44 - based on flexbox so it's a little
62:46 - misleading because it's calling it grid
62:49 - but it's not using css grid it's using
62:51 - flexbox correct me if i'm wrong but i'm
62:54 - it looks like from the css that
62:56 - everything's based on flex
62:58 - so what we've done is the standard for
63:01 - everything
63:03 - is still in place
63:06 - but on this one particular element we
63:09 - want to change the behavior so we use a
63:12 - line self
63:13 - center and then it can change changes
63:16 - this
63:17 - alignment to center and it doesn't
63:20 - affect any of the other ones
63:21 - does that make sense
63:26 - so let's go with that and let's add
63:29 - i'm not going to make a class i'm going
63:31 - to add this in right on that element
63:33 - because right now it doesn't look like
63:35 - we're going to have to repeat that
63:41 - so
63:45 - let's go over here
63:47 - to our
63:49 - grid
63:52 - and
63:53 - we're going to style
63:55 - we're going to style and then in react
63:59 - when we want to put a style on something
64:02 - we're actually going to make a
64:04 - javascript object
64:06 - so the first set of curly brackets
64:10 - lets us start writing javascript within
64:12 - this jsx
64:14 - so we've switched from kind of like the
64:16 - html like mode
64:18 - and now within these brackets we're in
64:20 - javascript mode so we can write
64:23 - pretty much the same way that we would
64:24 - write normal javascript
64:27 - and
64:28 - then so now i'm creating an object
64:30 - within there and now i can put the the
64:32 - style in there
64:33 - so we're going to do
64:35 - a line self
64:37 - and we can can we need to camel case
64:39 - that right because this is javascript if
64:41 - i put a line hyphen self it's going to
64:43 - think i'm trying to i'll take a line
64:45 - minus self
64:48 - okay so align self
64:50 - and then the next one we're going to
64:51 - make a string
64:54 - so everything unless it's just a pure
64:56 - number needs to be a string
64:59 - on
65:00 - on the right hand side of the colon
65:03 - and so we're going to say center
65:06 - okay
65:08 - and now when we save
65:10 - this will show up
65:13 - like an inline style one here
65:17 - so let's make
65:20 - sure yeah
65:22 - let's uh hit refresh just to
65:25 - verify we'll do an actual page refresh
65:30 - and
65:31 - there we are
65:33 - so you can see we still have this align
65:36 - self center
65:38 - and now that i look at it
65:41 - does that still look a little off to you
65:48 - that actually still looks a little off
65:50 - let's see if we can
65:52 - squish this together to get a better
65:54 - look at
65:57 - uh you know what it's it's not really
65:59 - that off i thought it was farther off
66:02 - so you can see here
66:04 - whoa
66:06 - so you can see here our lines are just a
66:08 - bit off
66:10 - and
66:11 - when it pops up his search field it's a
66:13 - bit off but i
66:16 - i'll live with that for right now
66:20 - um
66:24 - what do you all think i mean just for
66:25 - the sake of moving on
66:29 - i think we can live with that
66:31 - uh so
66:33 - i mean one reason is
66:35 - the screen's never going to be that
66:36 - small showing these side by side like
66:38 - that we'll switch to a mobile version
66:40 - that'll be different
66:42 - so
66:44 - when it's that far apart
66:49 - i don't know i'm okay with it for now
66:52 - it'll probably bother me for a while
66:53 - though let's refresh that again what's
66:56 - going on here
67:06 - the styles are definitely messed up here
67:10 - oh you know what
67:26 - see if that does anything
67:28 - no
67:51 - there we are
67:52 - okay
67:54 - uh i think what happened was
68:00 - the changes
68:03 - oh yeah i pulled in all the changes but
68:05 - i forgot to run yarn
68:07 - uh or npm install
68:10 - so i didn't get the latest version
68:13 - of
68:15 - uh of material ui
68:18 - so that was that was why these
68:20 - the size was all off
68:23 - okay all right now we're good
68:29 - and
68:30 - for these uh filter results for now
68:34 - the only thing i really want to do
68:36 - is decrease
68:39 - the padding in between these
68:43 - i just think it's a bit much
68:45 - once we get more filters in there
68:48 - then we can take a look and and really
68:51 - see like do we need
68:52 - you know how do we need to organize
68:54 - these
68:55 - uh but for now
69:00 - let's just decrease the padding a bit
69:02 - let's see do we still we like that color
69:06 - you know what i also want to change i
69:07 - may not do it today i don't think we'll
69:08 - have time today but i like to change it
69:11 - so that
69:12 - if you click this it only does a search
69:15 - again
69:16 - if
69:17 - there's actually some text in that
69:19 - search field
69:21 - so i i don't want it to just
69:25 - give you
69:28 - like automatically search when there's
69:30 - nothing in the search field
69:37 - oh um yusuf uh asked for it ngrok link
69:40 - yeah i'll paste it in there again i
69:42 - pasted it earlier and i forgot to paste
69:44 - it again
69:45 - uh here you are
69:52 - all right michael creo saying for now
69:53 - added to do yeah actually that's not a
69:55 - bad idea let's add some to do's
69:58 - in here
70:04 - to do
70:19 - more precisely is that how you spell
70:20 - precisely
70:23 - do you all ever just avoid using a word
70:25 - you don't know how to spell because you
70:26 - don't feel like actually verifying how
70:29 - it's spelled
70:33 - um
70:35 - and then what else did i just say we
70:37 - were gonna do
70:43 - oh okay with the search here so let's
70:45 - let's put this up here in the
70:48 - filter filter filter filter
70:52 - filter by category
71:19 - okay
71:23 - all right now let's check out what's
71:25 - going on with our padding here
71:37 - and i just want to see where that all
71:39 - that padding is coming from
71:43 - and it looks like
71:44 - it's not actually padding it's its
71:46 - height
71:53 - so we have margin right margin left
71:56 - right flex vertical in the middle
71:59 - so where where are we getting that
72:01 - height from
72:09 - maybe it's in here
72:14 - height 48
72:19 - all right if we drop that height let's
72:21 - see what our computed height is
72:29 - okay so why is our computed
72:34 - height let's check back here
72:37 - uh it's saying our computer right is 48.
72:42 - i mean that that does make sense
72:46 - interesting
72:50 - okay let's
72:52 - let's check this out
72:53 - where are we getting the height
72:55 - directly
73:00 - okay so that's on the button
73:03 - icon
73:04 - button
73:05 - which we don't directly have control
73:07 - over here huh
73:09 - menu i don't know that's not it oh we
73:11 - have these
73:15 - okay so within our check box
73:22 - we're going to have to look at the
73:23 - material ui documentation to see if we
73:25 - can change that i realize why they do
73:27 - that they want the check boxes to be
73:29 - easily clickable by someone's finger or
73:31 - thumb
73:32 - uh but if we're on a desktop we don't
73:35 - really need to worry about that
73:37 - uh so yeah so john just i just see in
73:39 - the live chat john's saying the same
73:41 - thing that that is 48 pixels is pretty
73:44 - standard
73:45 - for being clickable so
73:49 - i'm willing to go below that standard
73:51 - only for large screens
73:54 - i do want to keep that standard
73:57 - for smaller screens so actually my
74:00 - pomodoro timer just ran out so i think
74:03 - we'll keep it for now
74:04 - and i'll consider whether we should have
74:07 - right now it really doesn't matter like
74:09 - i mean this is fine
74:12 - my worry is if we get a lot more items
74:15 - it's it's going to be
74:16 - this is going to be too much it'll be
74:18 - overwhelming like the length of all the
74:20 - the options here so
74:23 - i guess this is something we'll revisit
74:26 - once we get more content here
74:30 - and and then we'll see what we need to
74:32 - do so
74:34 - let's commit these changes
74:38 - uh so let's go in our terminal here
74:41 - and for those of you who are new to the
74:43 - terminal and new to git and github
74:47 - i'm going to just explain what i'm doing
74:49 - while i'm doing it so i'm in the
74:50 - terminal i'm in the folder for this
74:53 - project
74:56 - and
74:56 - i'm going to do git status
75:01 - so if you have git installed on your
75:03 - computer you can use the command git
75:06 - so the git status is telling me that two
75:08 - files have changed the search.js file
75:11 - that we've been working in which we
75:12 - expect to change and then this yarn lock
75:15 - and that's whenever i went in and and
75:17 - ran the yarn command
75:19 - it changed this lock file so that's also
75:22 - expected even though we didn't directly
75:25 - uh do anything to log file
75:27 - which generally you shouldn't directly
75:29 - do anything to your lock file anyway
75:31 - so now that we've verified that these
75:33 - are the files that
75:35 - we expected to be changed
75:38 - we can do
75:40 - in this case we're going to run this
75:41 - command called yarn cm now this is
75:44 - probably going to be unfamiliar if you
75:46 - haven't watched any streams because this
75:48 - is kind of a
75:50 - custom setup i'm not we didn't make it
75:52 - all custom but
75:54 - the command whoa
75:59 - we never added it oh okay get ad i need
76:02 - to add first i need to add these files
76:05 - to
76:06 - the staging area
76:08 - so git add and then if i add a little
76:10 - dot a little period after that it'll
76:12 - just stage everything
76:14 - everything that changed
76:16 - so
76:17 - if we do a git status you can see now
76:19 - these have changed to green and
76:21 - they're in the
76:23 - uh staging areas it says changes to be
76:26 - committed
76:27 - now we're going to commit with yarn cm
76:30 - all this is going to do
76:32 - this is just kind of a layer on top of
76:34 - the normal git command so it's just
76:36 - going to walk us through how to write a
76:38 - good commit message and then just run a
76:41 - git commit on that
76:45 - so we're going to say it's a new feature
76:49 - and let's say
76:52 - update
76:54 - search ui
76:56 - and there are no breaking changes and i
76:59 - don't think this affects any issues
77:01 - now it's going to do a bunch of
77:02 - automated testing
77:06 - which this potentially depending on
77:10 - how good of a computer you have this
77:13 - could be
77:14 - a much longer process
77:18 - we did get one warning here
77:20 - since it was a warning we still passed
77:22 - and we can still do this but i believe
77:24 - this is due to our update to the newest
77:26 - version of material ui so for right now
77:29 - it's a warning
77:31 - but at some point we should check this
77:33 - out
77:35 - and see like perhaps this just isn't
77:37 - used anymore
77:40 - uh so we still have it in there and it's
77:42 - kind of a little confusing here to react
77:44 - so we'll see
77:45 - see what that is but not not an
77:47 - emergency type of thing so now that we
77:49 - have our commit message we're going to
77:51 - push this up to github so if you're
77:53 - using github in addition to git which a
77:56 - lot of people do you'll want to make
77:57 - sure you sync up everything you've done
77:59 - locally on your machine
78:01 - with github
78:03 - so that other people can see what you've
78:04 - done and you can access that on other
78:07 - computers as well and and they can too
78:10 - so we're just going to do a git push
78:13 - origin
78:14 - since we're on the master branch it'll
78:15 - automatically push to origin master if
78:18 - we wanted to push this to a different
78:19 - branch we could have done git push
78:20 - origin and then put the name of that
78:22 - other branch that we wanted to push to
78:25 - and that's it
78:27 - all done so now everything we've done
78:28 - today all the updates are available now
78:30 - on the get uh github repo the link is in
78:33 - the description to this video you all
78:35 - can use that do whatever you want with
78:37 - the code it's entirely uh free and open
78:40 - source
78:41 - and uh have have fun with it
78:46 - okay
78:48 - let me go to the live chat now and
78:50 - answer as many questions as as you all
78:52 - have if you do have any more questions
78:54 - please put them in the live chat now
78:56 - uh if you for whatever reason don't want
78:58 - to put your question in the live chat
78:59 - but you still like to ask it just reach
79:01 - out to me on any social media platform
79:05 - uh my the link to my github channel is

79:08 - and from there you can see um on the
79:11 - home page of my channel all my links to
79:13 - all my different social media things

79:22 - asks me a question
79:23 - at some point
79:45 - uh
79:46 - as she says hi i learned c plus plus and
79:50 - java right now i am uh in free code camp
79:53 - hoping i will understand your topic
79:56 - okay great i um yeah i hope that you get
79:59 - something useful out of this feel free
80:02 - to ask as many questions as you need to

80:52 - i
80:53 - i can't um answer that i
80:57 - i have
80:58 - almost no experience with c sharp
81:01 - uh i've just i've done a little bit when
81:03 - i've had to for this job
81:05 - so i don't really know if anybody else
81:06 - has experience with c sharp and knows of
81:08 - any good books please let us know in the
81:10 - live chat
81:12 - newshour asks what motivates you
81:15 - um
81:17 - i think there's a lot of different
81:18 - factors that that can motivate me so
81:20 - it's it's not usually one thing all the
81:22 - time you know it depends so
81:24 - uh obviously the overall you know
81:27 - motivation
81:29 - uh
81:31 - for me
81:32 - is to provide for my family right i mean
81:35 - that's like baseline you got to take
81:37 - care of your
81:38 - your basic needs before you can take
81:40 - care of anything else right so just
81:42 - making sure that my family has enough to
81:45 - eat you know i can
81:46 - put them through school have a house
81:48 - form and things like that
81:50 - right
81:51 - but i could really do that with any job
81:53 - so for specifically for coding what
81:56 - motivates me is number one i really i
81:59 - like to do this i think it's fun are
82:01 - there moments that are frustrating oh
82:04 - absolutely do i sometimes have to work
82:06 - on projects that aren't as fun yeah it
82:09 - happens but overall in general i really
82:11 - like this when
82:13 - when i'm home and on like the very rare
82:16 - occasions when i don't have any kids at
82:18 - home
82:19 - uh
82:20 - like
82:21 - coding is one of the things that i think
82:22 - oh i'm just gonna code like a side
82:24 - project to do something right so i it's
82:27 - it's like a hobby but i get paid for it
82:29 - okay so i do like it
82:31 - uh also
82:34 - um
82:34 - and i hope this doesn't sound bad but uh
82:38 - can competition motivates me right i
82:40 - like i want to be better i don't want to
82:43 - be better in the sense that i enjoy
82:45 - watching other people
82:47 - get beat right like this is you know
82:49 - one-on-one competition no i want
82:51 - everybody to get better but
82:53 - like i enjoy being better myself so in
82:55 - the healthiest version of competition
82:57 - where i want to be the best but i want
83:00 - all the competitors to be at the top of
83:02 - their game
83:03 - right so we can all get better together
83:06 - uh so hopefully that makes sense right
83:08 - like there are some people who want to
83:09 - win no matter what and
83:11 - it doesn't matter to them like if their
83:13 - opponent gets the flu and they win
83:14 - they're just as happy well that's that's
83:16 - not me
83:17 - right i'd i wouldn't be happy about that
83:19 - i want everybody to be really good and
83:21 - then
83:22 - push me to be really good too so
83:25 - um
83:27 - i don't know i think that's that's just
83:29 - an exciting thing
83:31 - uh to just try to find out like
83:35 - how much better can i be in building
83:37 - things you know
83:41 - and ultimately being better in web
83:43 - development means making things that are
83:45 - more useful to people there are more
83:47 - easily accessible that make their lives
83:49 - easier that that look beautiful
83:52 - you know that's that's what better means
83:54 - so
83:55 - i'm not gauging success in terms of
83:58 - motivation you know really by money
84:01 - in terms of providing for my family
84:03 - money is
84:05 - you know obviously what i need to gauge
84:07 - that by
84:08 - in addition to being able to spend time
84:10 - with them
84:11 - but then in terms of being motivated by
84:13 - wanting to be better
84:15 - it has almost nothing to do with money
84:17 - it's
84:18 - you know
84:18 - is what i'm making is it quality work
84:21 - you know is it really helping people so
84:23 - anyway
84:26 - i hope that wasn't too long of an answer
84:27 - for you all but those are kind of some
84:29 - of my my motivators and sometimes when
84:31 - you're just down you got to make up your
84:33 - own motivators like or you gotta have
84:36 - help so like you gotta drink an energy
84:38 - drink or give yourself like little
84:40 - things like okay if i every time i
84:42 - finish a new pomodoro session uh i'm
84:45 - gonna like eat a bite of chocolate or do
84:48 - something that
84:49 - uh that you wanna do like i've actually
84:52 - done it before where like every time i
84:53 - had a five minute break in my pomodoro
84:55 - session i would watch five minutes of a
84:58 - netflix show
85:01 - which is silly to watch five minutes at
85:03 - a time but like that was my reward to
85:05 - get me through
85:07 - that that little portion i think at the
85:10 - time i was putting in like crazy hours
85:12 - so it's just like anything that i could
85:14 - do to just
85:15 - uh keep going so anyway those are some
85:17 - of the things that motivate me and on
85:19 - any given day i might be more or less
85:22 - motivated by one of those things but you
85:25 - know together it really keeps me
85:27 - on track and passionate about what i'm
85:29 - doing
85:30 - let me know what you all think is
85:32 - motivating for you i'm really interested
85:34 - to hear what motivates other people
85:37 - so let me know in the chat
85:39 - uh or in the comments the video or even
85:42 - uh in social media somehow
85:46 - tag me in in it or whatever you can even
85:49 - dm me if you want
85:53 - let's see
85:56 - okay uh why
85:58 - why didn't you join any company
86:00 - well i mean i'm not
86:03 - i work for university
86:05 - um
86:08 - so
86:10 - i guess that counts as a company right
86:17 - john hanson says for mobile just use a
86:19 - modal for filters and sorting
86:23 - yeah i could
86:27 - i'm either going to use a drop down or
86:30 - in material ui you can actually have two
86:32 - different drawers come out so i could
86:34 - have the one drawer come out for the
86:36 - main menu and i could have a drawer come
86:38 - out of the other side the right side
86:40 - for
86:41 - the filters
86:44 - so i just have to figure out what
86:48 - what button are people going to press to
86:49 - get to those filters
86:52 - that might be kind of cool
86:54 - i'll have to remember that
86:59 - michael says a bunch of new people in
87:01 - here today that's a good thing yeah
87:03 - definitely for everyone that's new here
87:04 - welcome i really appreciate you watching
87:06 - i know towards the end here we've kind
87:08 - of dropped off so i wish i would have
87:09 - acknowledged you all earlier when there
87:11 - were you know about twice as many people
87:13 - in here uh but
87:15 - if you stuck around if you're here uh
87:18 - yeah thank you so much for watching and
87:21 - i really want to be receptive to what
87:23 - you all want so any advice you have for
87:25 - me or any questions please let me know
87:28 - i'm
87:30 - i'm usually super nice about everything
87:32 - so
87:33 - i'm cool with criticism you know try to
87:35 - be nice but if you must be mean i'm not
87:38 - going to cry
87:39 - at least on camera
87:41 - but
87:43 - but anyway i'm serious i want to make
87:45 - this better so let me know what would
87:46 - you all want you know what kind of
87:48 - things you like what kind of things you
87:49 - don't like
88:08 - all right
88:16 - not too many questions left let's see
88:18 - noble and savage says woot hi all hey
88:21 - how's it going
88:22 - thanks for joining us
88:32 - oh john hanson says use a negative
88:35 - margin left on the input titles this
88:37 - won't impact on the standard clickable
88:39 - area
88:42 - okay i think i like i like that idea
88:44 - well i'm not gonna do it right now um
88:48 - but when it comes time for us to really
88:50 - start getting detailed on this as we get
88:53 - more of uh the filters on here
88:56 - yeah i'll definitely want to mess with
88:58 - this to to see
89:01 - if it looks better you know with them
89:03 - being closer
89:05 - that's a good trick
89:09 - uh nino says do you know when
89:12 - why
89:14 - um
89:15 - just for the terminal vibe
89:18 - v-e-n-v
89:21 - what's
89:23 - i'm not sure what that is was it
89:24 - supposed to be end i don't know uh in
89:26 - python can't be active from the terminal
89:29 - uh in visual studio code
89:32 - i i have no idea i i haven't done
89:34 - anything with python for
89:37 - years
89:38 - so
89:39 - i really have no ideas i'm sorry
89:47 - michael says i've been playing around
89:49 - with graphql slash react for a day or so
89:53 - so
89:54 - when i think like i understand what's
89:56 - going on watch out you might have a
89:58 - harsher 2.0
90:00 - all right i'm looking forward to it yeah
90:02 - unfortunately i had to stream later
90:04 - today because i had other stuff going on
90:05 - so i know
90:06 - harsh it's most likely sleeping at least
90:09 - i hope he's sleeping it should be it's
90:10 - really late where he's at
90:12 - uh so i'm gonna try to stream earlier
90:15 - uh tomorrow if i can
90:18 - and
90:19 - i know he's busy right now with school
90:21 - so maybe he can join us for those of you
90:22 - who don't know harshad he's
90:25 - a veteran i guess of the channel and
90:27 - very outspoken in
90:29 - helping me
90:31 - when i'm doing something
90:32 - wrong uh but it it truly is it is
90:36 - helpful
90:42 - michael says but i'm three times his age
90:44 - so that's kind of creepy
90:46 - that's true yeah harshit is only 16. um
90:49 - and actually when he was 15 when he
90:51 - started watching the the streams and
90:53 - uh very smart
90:55 - i think he's gonna
90:57 - he's gonna be a very good programmer if
90:59 - he keeps going at this pace
91:01 - he's already good
91:08 - let's see
91:09 - carlos says jesse can you explain the
91:11 - yarn command on git
91:13 - oh yeah for sure let me explain that
91:16 - that again so
91:18 - what we did here on the terminal let me
91:20 - go up and show you
91:21 - um
91:24 - so instead of doing a regular git commit
91:27 - we did yarn cm
91:31 - and then we got these little prompts
91:33 - that basically writes a commit message
91:35 - for us
91:36 - and then
91:38 - the commit actually happens so let me
91:40 - scroll down i wonder if you would be
91:42 - able to see it yeah so here's where
91:46 - the commit happens
91:49 - so you see this is the commit message
91:51 - that we actually got
91:52 - feet right for new feature because we
91:54 - said yes we selected that option and
91:57 - then for our message we put in update
92:00 - search ui
92:01 - and we said no to everything else so
92:03 - this is our message so it creates a
92:05 - message for us
92:07 - depending on what answers we give to the
92:10 - questions
92:11 - so it's just a little additional thing
92:13 - that helps us make a nice uniform commit
92:16 - message
92:17 - all right michael says i'm out it's been
92:19 - fun hey uh see you later michael thanks
92:21 - for joining us
92:25 - so that's what we're doing if you want
92:26 - to know more about exactly what's going
92:28 - on behind the scenes i would check out
92:30 - the package json file let's see where
92:33 - that's at
92:34 - our package.json
92:36 - yeah so here's our package.json file and
92:39 - down here we have this cm
92:42 - and
92:43 - that does a get cz
92:49 - and we're using committed
92:53 - so check out committed
92:57 - and if you want to know more about how
92:59 - to do stuff like this and how to set
93:00 - this up
93:04 - and i believe there was
93:07 - a pull request for this so if you check
93:09 - through the pull request for this
93:10 - project on github you'll find one that
93:12 - has to do with this and there's probably
93:14 - some more info on on how to use it there
93:22 - oh carla says awesome thanks for
93:24 - explaining i always have a hard time
93:26 - thinking what to put in a commit
93:28 - uh
93:29 - with what i'm doing yeah me too for sure
93:31 - so this does help a bit it helps you
93:33 - kind of think through okay what am i
93:35 - what am i doing here
93:36 - so
93:38 - uh yeah it's definitely a really cool
93:39 - addition to the project
93:55 - oh cool carlos says awesome class had a
93:57 - great time learned a lot i'm glad i'm
93:58 - really glad um
94:00 - you know join us again if you can
94:02 - sometime i'd love to have you back
94:13 - java bat says would you recommend using
94:16 - react with es6 plus typescript
94:20 - i don't know that i can recommend it
94:21 - because i haven't really used it i've
94:23 - looked at other repos that use it
94:26 - i haven't in terms of typescript like
94:28 - es6 with react for sure for sure use es6
94:31 - with react it's
94:33 - it's a lot better
94:35 - if you take advantage of what's
94:36 - available in es6
94:39 - if you're not familiar with es6 it's
94:41 - kind of the newer things that are
94:42 - available to use with javascript
94:46 - sometimes called uh
94:47 - es2015 i believe es 2015 is is actually
94:51 - the the official name for it but
94:54 - most people say es6
94:56 - uh in terms of typescript though
95:00 - i don't i don't know enough
95:02 - i don't have enough uh experience
95:03 - working with it to really tell you if it
95:06 - would be better
95:07 - it would probably depend on your project
95:10 - honestly to to determine like how much
95:13 - benefit would you get out of it
95:16 - if anybody else uses typescript with
95:17 - react and can give a better answer that
95:20 - question uh please you know let us know
95:23 - in the chat
95:26 - uh bhuvana
95:28 - asks does this session go on every day
95:30 - um yeah er monday through friday i try
95:33 - to do a session every day i don't always
95:36 - get to do a session every day but that's
95:38 - my goal
95:42 - uh viral only says hi thanks for the
95:44 - session uh you're welcome thanks for
95:46 - watching
95:58 - uh john hanson says i just realized that
96:00 - by using the array function find it
96:02 - totally isn't supported at all in
96:04 - internet explorer
96:07 - good
96:08 - that's
96:11 - i'm of the opinion that we're not doing
96:13 - our users any favors by supporting
96:16 - outdated browsers especially browsers
96:18 - that are so outdated
96:20 - that it's security risk to the user
96:23 - we're enabling
96:25 - them
96:26 - to
96:27 - uh keep doing things that are bad for
96:30 - them right to keep doing these bad
96:33 - security practices they probably don't
96:35 - even know it
96:36 - but if more sites i mean this may be
96:39 - controversial but if more sites just
96:40 - wouldn't work for them at all
96:42 - maybe it would spur them to say hey
96:44 - something's wrong with my computer or my
96:46 - browser and actually learn more about it
96:48 - and update
96:51 - if we keep supporting all these old
96:52 - browsers
96:54 - then
96:56 - we're just enabling
96:58 - hackers or whoever to
97:00 - take advantage of people who know a
97:02 - little bit less about computers instead
97:03 - we should educate our users with a
97:06 - little message or something saying
97:07 - please update your browser for your
97:10 - security and for a better experience
97:13 - also i think we got to think about like
97:15 - what is the reason behind why we want to
97:17 - support these older browsers
97:19 - right
97:20 - mistakenly we may be thinking like oh we
97:22 - want to include everybody and we want
97:24 - everybody to be able to experience our
97:25 - site i mean that's a good thought but
97:28 - you know at the bottom of it at the root
97:30 - of it
97:33 - especially if we're one if we're selling
97:34 - something
97:36 - are we just supporting older browsers
97:38 - because we want the most number of
97:40 - people possibly able to buy our product
97:42 - or do something online no i'm not saying
97:44 - that's what everybody does but at some
97:46 - point somebody higher up is probably
97:47 - thinking that like more people coming to
97:50 - our site equals more money so we want as
97:52 - many people as possible without really
97:54 - thinking like
97:56 - okay but is that with what's best for
97:58 - the user
97:59 - so
98:01 - that's that's my reasoning i'm not
98:02 - trying to be mean by not supporting
98:04 - older browsers but my reasoning behind
98:06 - not supporting older browsers is
98:09 - genuinely being concerned that people
98:11 - have no idea
98:13 - what kind of danger they're putting
98:15 - their themselves and their computers in
98:17 - by using such outdated browsers when
98:19 - there are so many security safeguards in
98:22 - the newer versions
98:24 - anyway i know i've talked about that
98:26 - before in the stream so if you've heard
98:28 - me say that before sorry for repeating
98:30 - myself um but
98:33 - that's my view on it
98:35 - i will say this if you do it like that
98:37 - and you don't support browsers
98:39 - um it's it's probably good to have some
98:42 - sort of check for a browser and display
98:45 - some sort of message to let the user
98:46 - know what's going on
98:48 - if the site just breaks and doesn't work
98:50 - that's not a good user experience at
98:51 - least if you have a very polite
98:55 - message explaining the situation to the
98:57 - user then you are actually providing
98:59 - some help so
99:01 - we'll have to remember to put that in
99:02 - this project or else i'm going to sound
99:03 - like a big hypocrite so
99:06 - let's plan on doing that
99:08 - i have done it for some of my projects
99:10 - uh i admit i don't always remember to do
99:13 - that
99:14 - and sometimes i do end up supporting
99:16 - older browsers occasionally
99:20 - i i don't do it a lot sometimes i just
99:23 - do it
99:24 - kind of accidentally because build tools
99:26 - like a lot of build tools take care of
99:28 - that for you but anyway
99:33 - i'm going to move on
99:38 - noble and savage says i met someone
99:40 - today that uses ie there's a lot of
99:42 - people that use ie on campus here that i
99:45 - run into
99:47 - always amazed
99:50 - john anson says there's a lot of elderly
99:52 - people still using internet explorer
99:53 - eight yeah somebody on campus was using
99:55 - internet explorer eight and had a hard
99:57 - time trying to use some of the sites
99:59 - that i built
100:00 - and um
100:02 - finally realized that they were on
100:04 - internet explorer eight and that was the
100:05 - problem
100:15 - java bat says do you have something like
100:16 - a set of css classes which you are using
100:18 - as a basis for every project uh yes
100:21 - something like that so
100:23 - uh depending on what we're doing if
100:24 - we're doing a react project we're we're
100:27 - always using material ui
100:30 - which comes with its own set i mean it's
100:32 - it's like bootstrap or materialize but
100:34 - for react projects
100:37 - if we're doing a non-react project we
100:39 - use materialized css and then we also
100:42 - have
100:44 - some classes that we just kind of carry
100:46 - over
100:48 - to new projects we usually use sas
100:50 - and we have some sas variables for
100:52 - different colors and things
100:54 - that we carry over
100:55 - so we do have a style guide
100:59 - that really needs updated right now so i
101:01 - kind of don't even want to give you the
101:02 - address to it because it needs updated
101:04 - so badly
101:06 - but that also is the idea behind it
101:10 - is to include some css that you can
101:12 - reuse on on other projects
101:15 - and and make all the websites will have
101:17 - the same kind of like standard
101:20 - look and ui
101:21 - so that users
101:23 - you know they don't have to re-learn how
101:25 - your ui works for every different site
101:27 - you know it shouldn't be like that and
101:29 - within one organization there should be
101:32 - some standardization you know for the
101:34 - sake of
101:35 - of uh lessening the confusion of the
101:38 - users and for for brand identity
101:41 - purposes
101:44 - um let's see
101:46 - john hanson says internet explorer is at
101:48 - 2.8 percent worldwide
101:50 - oh i'm glad i'm glad it's it's only 2.8
101:53 - percent
101:58 - uh java bats also says svgs are always a
102:01 - problem for me on internet explorer
102:04 - interesting i'll have to check that out
102:06 - i haven't
102:07 - to take the truth i don't really test on
102:09 - internet explorer very much anymore so i
102:11 - just haven't noticed
102:12 - if my svgs are working
102:17 - john hanson is talking about says inline
102:19 - svgs have less problems on ie
102:22 - maybe that's why i do like to use inline
102:24 - svgs whenever i can
102:27 - java says thanks for the answer oh yeah
102:29 - no problem
102:30 - no problem
102:31 - um
102:33 - all right cool i think i got through
102:35 - everything if i miss your question for
102:36 - some reason just uh put in the comments
102:39 - or send it to me some other way
102:41 - and i'll try to give you a good answer
102:43 - if i can
102:45 - uh
102:46 - i do believe i'll be able to stream
102:48 - tomorrow not sure what time yet i'll let
102:50 - you know tomorrow morning at some point
102:52 - um
102:53 - and if you subscribe to the free code
102:54 - camp channel and turn on notifications
102:56 - you'll get notified whenever i do a live
102:58 - stream i also do live streams and videos
103:01 - on my own channel so if you're
103:03 - interested you can subscribe and get
103:05 - notifications on that channel as well
103:09 - i i'm gonna get ready to put out a new
103:11 - video soon because it's been since the
103:12 - beginning of march since i've done a
103:14 - video on my own channel so
103:16 - it's coming up soon if anybody really
103:18 - really wants me to do a video on a
103:20 - specific topic uh let me know
103:22 - somehow uh within the next day or two
103:26 - because i i want to get a video out here
103:27 - soon
103:29 - um
103:30 - let's see other than that i do announce
103:32 - on twitter and usually on instagram when
103:34 - i'm gonna stream so whatever method you
103:37 - prefer to get your news uh please you
103:39 - know follow me on those places and
103:42 - that's the best way to find out what
103:43 - time i'm streaming
103:46 - um
103:47 - yeah all right that's it for me thank
103:48 - you all
103:49 - again for watching and for being
103:52 - involved in the chat and for all your
103:54 - your help

103:56 - and
103:58 - i'll be back tomorrow until then
104:01 - have a wonderful day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're gonna do some ui work so we're gonna try to stay as close as we can within material design principles and uh we're working on this search page so i've been looking at probably what's the most wellknown search page with lots of filters and that is amazon search a wellknown search in general probably be google's search page but i think for our use case we're going to have filters that are closer to what amazon uses so we can take some inspiration from google search page as well but at least for the desktop version i think we're going to be better off going with something similar to what amazon uses uh even even the mobile as well i think the way amazon has done it is pretty nice so on my other screen i'm trying to get these examples up of what what both amazon and google do for their search uh filters and sorting uh for some reason it's not let me resize this window here we go hmm okay let me let me get ngrok started for you all so if you're not familiar with ngrok this is going to allow all of you to use this link to see the website that's being hosted locally you can inspect it in your own dev tools you know on your own machine as we're going so that's in the live chat i'll probably paste it again in a few minutes as more people join looks like we have yeah we have about our average uh number of viewers in here now so i'm going to switch my screen and get started uh i do want to let you all know especially those of you who watch my last stream uh that i tried to do at home and the quality wasn't too great that i did upgrade my internet service to the highest level i could possibly get at my my house and i'm hoping that'll help and i also messed around with a lot of the settings i looked at what a bunch of other people were doing i had some help um so you know like the youtube um live stream or the uh 24 7 uh free code camp music stream that's going now so the guy who does that uh pretty matthew i think his name is matthew i hope i didn't get that wrong uh but matthew worked with me for like an hour we were trying to figure it out so i've done all that i think i can at this point to try to get it to work so hopefully the next time i try to do it from home which may be tomorrow or sometime next week it will work i'm aiming to get 720p resolution i think that'll be high enough so that everyone can see the font i don't really think it'd be possible for my current setup to get higher than 720p so i'm hopeful for that i really would would want to have a better quality for you all also i'm working on a project let's get this let's get our ui started uh should we do you know normally we do a mobile first one but i think i'd rather start off with a desktop search because the mobile first one is going to add the mobile version of our search is going to add a bit more complexity and i don't know that i want to deal with that right now i think it'd be better to go with the more simple one and then add the complexity of having drop downs and things so that's what we'll do so any i'm working on a new project if anyone is interested let me know i'll have a get up repo up soon but i i put some details on twitter yesterday or the day before or so and i bought a a brain computer interface headset so i don't know if you all have ever seen this but uh you put this headset on it's kind of like headphones uh and it it monitors your your brain activity your brain waves and um you can tell you know certain things about what's going on in the brain like are you more relaxed uh or you know are you more focused uh things like that so my son uh my oldest son who's eight years old he has obsessivecompulsive disorder or he has some issues where you know he'll just like get he gets himself all worked up about something and if it gets bad enough he just like he can't get out of this uh this mentality where he's just so frustrated and upset so my idea is that i'm going to take those brain waves and i'm going to use some of the work that alex castillo has been doing so uh you could check out alex on his alex castillo dot io uh check him out on twitter you know he's been at a bunch of conferences but he's done a lot of work with being able to interpret the signal from those uh headsets and and bring it in and manipulate use that for with javascript so basically pull it into a website or a web app so i'd like to do that same thing and alex has actually offered to help me with this which is awesome and i want to bring it into a very simple javascript game that's going to help my son recognize when his brain is starting to get into that pattern where it's he's gonna get all worked up to recognize that early enough so he can get himself out of that and also to help him train his brain to be able to get himself out of that to calm down so the idea is just very loose right now but the idea of the game is that certain mechanics in the game are going to be based on his his brain activity so in order to move forward in the game and progress he'll have to successfully calm himself down so there's going to be a lot of fine tuning that's going to happen i know there's definitely got to be a balance between like making the game um challenging enough so that it actually does give him incentive and train him to you know help correct his thought patterns but it also can't be too challenging that it actually would make him more frustrated so he does get really frustrated with video games if if he keeps like losing and losing so it's gonna probably take a long time but i think if it could work it could be really helpful for my son but potentially helpful for other people who are dealing with mental health issues especially with kids adults have a much easier time verbalizing what they're thinking but kids especially when my son was younger you just never knew what was going on in his head he didn't know how to explain what he was experiencing so i'm thinking that this may help so i'm going to start with start with my son and see how it goes so anyway i'll probably give you you know updates on this as it goes on you know i may even live stream some of the work on it record some of the results uh because i think i mean other people might be interested and you know other people that maybe are way more experienced than me might be interested and might be able to do more with the project and help more people so anyway enough with that project let's get to our project uh that that we're working on today and that is this search page so today what we're going to do is just take these filters that we have here and this sorting and we're just going to move it over we're gonna move it to the side so let's see what side left side or right side i don't really know i don't know whether we should do left or right if any as one has any opinion on that let me know otherwise i guess we'll just start on the right side yeah so essentially this this section here will be split into um let's say a fourth of it or a third of it will be filters and then the rest will be search results okay james saying right side okay we can try that all right so let's get this into position first we'll kind of fill out you know this basic grid that we'll have that'll keep these in their right sections and uh we could probably determine like at what point we need to switch to a mobile view and then then we'll go uh get like kind of a little bit more detailed with fixing padding and things like that sorry sorry about the on okay all right so uh some of you are commenting here on on this um michael says won't be able to stay till i see what you intend all right fair enough yeah it's i have an image in my head but of course you all can't see that so james asks a great question how many check boxes will there be eventually there may end up being quite a few yeah definitely more than three so let me let me pull over uh from amazon here let me pull this over under the screen so you all can see kind of what what they're doing and so so you can see what i have in my mind a bit so i just did a search for a webcam because i'm i'm looking for a better webcam for streaming but they have their refined by section here and you can click on these different things but they have them and we may end up having to do this as well to help the user they have them in these little subsections and depending on how many filtering options we end up having that that might be a better way to go so something similar to this and then amazon puts their sort by up here i mean that's a possibility if that's what you where a user would expect it to be and instead of with the filters then i'm open to that um and then the search bar i do kind of want to keep the search bar like maybe at the top so maybe something more like search bar where it is except with better padding and not completely across the entire screen filters next to the search bar or i'm sorry the sorting next to the search bar and then filters down one of the sides oh cool when nikki says the uh logitech 920 is often used for stream streaming so yeah i think i was looking at one of these 920 models so there's some of them i'm just trying to determine like what how good do i need it to be uh for for streaming because some of them are there's one that's you can stream you can record 4k and things like that i definitely don't you all don't need to see my face in 4k i'm pretty sure let's see all right michael says uh those aren't searches though the choices anyway when you start inputting in search bar brings up choices for departments um logitech has a gold box today on logitech all right i'm getting a lot of input on the um webcam okay so i'm not going to read it right now i'm going to wait and read it after let me start this pomodoro timer so we can get to work after 25 minutes i'm going to go back to the live chat and answer any questions that you you all may have put in there um and we can talk more about webcams then uh but right now let's start with the search bar all right we'll start with the first things that we're gonna have on the page and we'll work our way down so it'll be search bar first filter second i'm sorry i keep mixing these up forget what i just said search bar first sorting second over here and then filters somewhere on one of these sides all right so let's go into our our file first you can check out the where the search.js file so you can check out the github repo if you like the description for this video should have a link to the repository and let's go down to where we have that input here it is here's our search input and we haven't used the material design style for testing we just threw in a regular input so the first thing we're going to want to do is go to the material ui documentation and we're going to grab some code from there to be able to use this input we are up unless material ui came out with a new beta update within the last two days we are completely up to date so i did merge that other branch into master and i found out after i restarted the server i did find some things that broke in the ui so basically almost everything was fixed by me changing type to variant that was most of the work if you want to see specifically what i change go check the last few commits and that should give you an idea of what it takes to upgrade to the latest version of material ui uh in terms of dealing with braking changes luckily a lot of the braking changes dealt with components that we didn't even use so that was good for us so we should have this open material ui nope those are the icons there we are i always have a material ui window open somewhere okay so this is material uinext.com so we're using the latest beta version and actually let's refresh this see if we get the newest version what i refreshed it now i can't use this sidebar what is going on there we are okay beta 38. i that's what we're on so we're in beta 38 we're all up to date let's check out our components and what do we have inputs text fields there we are okay so we're going to want a text field here's a search field i guess we could check out the code for the search field we're definitely going to need to bring in a text field so let's pull that in right now we'll bring in this import let me zoom in a bit so you all can see so we're importing text field and then we're also going to bring in uh we'll figure out what styles we need let's see textview yeah let's just pull in this text field styles we're probably going to need those and put um let's put them here as of right now my my organization for our styles object is basically just in the order that these elements appear on the page might not be the best way to do it but uh it it's working right now okay now let's find that let's see we already have our our handle change so we're good with that search there we are i'm not sure right now what is different about the search field it looks pretty much the same i guess we'll find out okay so we have this input now and at first i'm just going to put this in right above our current input so i can make sure that we have search type search all right uh you know what let's see we want this to be a controlled component let's see if let's see if that's how they're doing this one all right let's find that multiline that's controlled where is that um i thought the last time i looked at this there was a version where they used the controlled input okay so it is just value here okay all right that should work then so we're going to add whoa not that uh so we're going to add this value here and we also need this on change here and let's get rid of this and see what we have label search i don't think i need that okay oh what is going on failed to save important text field what did i just do all right uh check check i don't know what just happened let's see if it caught our changes all right there we go text field i'll change your search results whoa that's not right i'm gonna check the live chat see if any of you caught what what i just did what the heck okay let's do this i'm going to grab this text field i'm going to copy it and throw it over here in our file of scraps and then i'm gonna go to the github report i'm gonna grab the original file so it wasn't let me undo the changes wonder if i can manually undo undo yeah i cannot do any of that um so we're gonna grab that file i guess i could just johnson i may have an extra closing bracket somewhere yeah it looks like i accidentally deleted some stuff right or pasted in some things that i shouldn't have i yeah i'm not exactly sure what happened so anyway i'll fix it right now uh i don't need any of that stuff that looks good so i'm just gonna copy um the let's see checkbox form control form control label checkbox svg okay so from here down to this second form control i think is what we need let's double check that we do have that classes select value okay i think that's that's it all right text field is not defined okay let's try this again did anybody catch what happened what did i do okay now let's save it okay successful save that time all right now there we are now i have a search field let's actually put search out there which probably not going to have it like that so let's do let's do our search for biology okay wonderful all right cool so it is it is searching okay maybe maybe since i said it was a search field it automatically gives me that x which is actually really cool very cool all right so we have our search field step one completed let's check our time 11 minutes left on our timer cool uh let's see okay sort by that's what we're doing now let's go grab all the stuff for sort by and first thing we're going to do is just move it up here and then once you do that then we can work on whatever else we need to make this look nice and be very obvious to the user what it's going to do so this was already put in i believe nikki was the one that that did put that in there so uh nikki already filled it in with the uh material design style so we won't have to worry about changing anything for that so right now this whole form controls like yep there we are so we're just going to take that and remove it from where it is we're going to move it up here above uh our we uh we're gonna move it up here but what we might want to do though is change change this form actually on submit is get form results we don't actually have a submit button there dewey and what is this svg i'm going to take this i'm going to take this out and this svg and i'm going to replace the forms with with this form control okay all right let's see how that looks whoa okay so now we have everything up here in this line and we're gonna i probably need to add some grid stuff here okay let's check out in material ui let's check out our layout stuff and see where our grid is i just want to see what okay grid container all right grid containers and grid items all right it's been a few weeks since i worked with this uh i just needed a refresher on the syntax okay so let's just put some containers in here uh we're definitely gonna want a container here and within the same grid container i want to have i guess we could put everything in the container let's try to put everything in one grid container right now and see if that works just oops that was it right grid grid yeah okay so we put it all in the grid oh john hanson has a good point here it says submit function in a form without a submit button is the enter key okay i guess that shouldn't be a problem since we're searching automatically there wouldn't really be a reason to hit the enter key the user could hit the enter key and it would seem like it worked anyway but because since we're just automatically searching so i guess that should be all right if anyone has a different reason why we should keep what we had before and let me know all right let's import grid as well um and as this component starts to get larger it's probably going to be a good idea to separate it out into multiple components but while we're building it we'll keep it all in one place once we get it to a place where it looks good this is you know pretty much what we want then we can separate it out i find as long as it's not too large it's easier to have it all in one spot while you're making it at least for me all right and i suppose let's we can grab this container do we already have a container class i think we do content container okay so this should work so let's see what it's done we need to add our um our grid items in now because it's going to look silly without it okay so we just need to add grid item and then we can add in our values for what we want we like how many rows we want this to take up okay so let's put around i'm just gonna put these in and not really worry about the values for now i just want to get it all in there all right and i apologize if i'm gonna be a little off today i started to get a headache i actually started to get really bad heartburn in a headache right before the stream so i took some uh pain medicine to try to get rid of the headache and uh it's starting to come back again so i'm gonna do my best i want to see how these i better type in something legitimate i want to see how these results look okay i mean this is makes sense this is exactly what i just told it to do uh so now let's go back and give this some legitimate values what do you have all right about two minutes i'm gonna come back to the live chat and answer answer all the questions for now let's go in here and give let's set this to 12. am i using let me see what i'm using am i using a 12 grid let's inspect this for a second okay it looks like it is great at least for now that's skids we want all right let's go with let's go up here to our search bar uh let's give this um so out of 12 let's give this nine and that can stay three and then that's down here let's take this grid and let's move it down below here and we'll keep this at 3 and we'll make this a nine and that'll be all right because things ought to line up there we are so these will line up and these will line up okay hopefully now you see a little bit um a little bit more about what i was going for so the filters will be here right sort here so it doesn't really look like much right now i think we still have some work to put in for this but this is about what we're going if you think the filters would definitely look better on this side let me know we can do that that won't really be a problem for now uh my timer just went off so i'm going to take a five minute break i am gonna take a drink here so as always i'm drinking my g fuel i put up a post on uh instagram with my g fuel in it and i tag g fuel in it and i gave him a little hint that they got an opportunity for me to be a spokesperson if they want it so they didn't get back to me though not yet they you know they might be busy maybe they'll get back to me later this week all right oops let me start this all right so five minutes i'm gonna try to get through as many questions as i can all right nikki says hey excited for f1 to start again this weekend cool i'm i'm not really a racing fan i'm not antiracing but i just don't often watch it but i'm glad you're excited for it nikki says i hope daniel ricardo rick ricciardo said does well uh cool again i'm not really knowledgeable about racing but good luck daniel uh but matthias says hi jesse love your stuff keep it up thank you i appreciate that and i plan on keeping it up for as long as i can as long as it's beneficial to you all i will keep doing this james ross says it's the new project a beard no i've completed that project i that was our last project the beard will probably be leaving soon it's it's gonna start getting warmer now despite all the snow that that a lot of us got uh yesterday it is gonna start getting warmer and then beards aren't as fun santiago says greetings from venezuela uh the game sounds like a good idea oh thank you thank you so that was if you weren't here at the beginning i gave kind of my plan for one of my side projects so you can if you're interested in my side project that has to do with brain human interface or brain computer interfaces check it out uh on the recording you just go back and watch the first like 10 minutes uh let's see i'm scrolling down to find some questions all right so here was some discussion about what the best camera is for streaming that i should get so if anybody has any experience with webcams please let me know your opinion uh basically the logitech 920 series seems like something that i should look into um i don't the only thing that i ever really do is like images of me right like doing this just like i'm doing now so i don't know what quality i really need i saw one that's uh a pretty good deal on amazon i think it was only like 40 or 50 dollars which was discounted from the the normal price and it could do you can record in 1080p but you can only stream in 720. i think that would be okay i mean i don't let me know if you think that quality would be all right for me uh i i mean i really i'd rather not spend a ton of money and i don't make any money from streaming so it's it's not like an investment for me it's just would be a little bit better quality so anyway if you have any experience with webcams uh especially if you're streaming with them uh please let me know what what you all think is is a good one preferably one under a hundred dollars okay daniel says uh daniel frank says i can personally vouch for the 920 and it has worked in my enterprise for three years straight everyday use oh excellent that's exactly what i wanted that's that's really uh good advice uh i mean you know you you can read all you want online you can read reviews but it's much better to like really talk to somebody who knows so uh i appreciate that daniel oh michael says about search bar stuff i like the amazon drop down incorporated into the search bar then the autofill entries into the search results not sure how hard that is in react okay so is that somewhat like what we're what we're doing that the filters are kind of with the search results and then the drop down is kind of with the i know it's not as closely with it as on amazon but i think that's a bit what we're going with that general idea michael says or to save space especially on mobile have a multiselect drop down that autofills with returned available filters yeah that's what i'm planning on doing on mobile so definitely basically the only thing you'll see right off the bat on mobile is the search field everything else will be in a drop down yeah it'll be in a multiselect drop down maybe i'll have the sort by in its own drop down as well i don't i don't want to get too crazy and have too much stuff uh you know because the mobile you only have limited space on mobile so we'll see how much space we can get but that's basically what i'm uh what i was thinking i'm going with okay i am almost to the bottom of the live chat so let me see i don't think there's that many questions left uh so i may go ahead even though my timer went off i might try to get just these last few just don't want to keep you all waiting with for the answers for too long let's see uh jason lee asks what's the timers for is this a freelance project the timer is just to break up our time here so that i don't spend too much time talking or too much time coding we get a nice kind of break in between i also use the pomodoro timer just to break up my day it's not a freelance project this is uh i'm a frontend developer i work fulltime salary for a university ah let's see software dev says it is interesting that you've got tags like grid control and form control is that precompiled in normal html tags and the javascript is within the html all right nikki says it's not really html just looks like it all right so this is a good segue back into the code here so let's um let's go over this yeah let me go over this now then so let me start our our coding timer and the first thing we'll do is just kind of do a quick recap of what we've done to go over some of these these tags so software dev is asking about these tags so um basically if you're not and i'm not assuming software dev that you're not familiar with react but anybody out there that's not that familiar with react all of this here looks a lot like html but it's actually not it's it's jsx and what this is is is syntactic sugar on top of javascript functions to create dom elements uh so really what what these will break down into is a javascript function that's going to create a select field and create these items within these select fields but that's really hard to write if you're used to html it's kind of a pain to write all these functions like uh think of like continually writing like document.creator or uh get element by id or create it yeah you know what i'm saying it's it's a lot so this makes it easier that we can write basically what looks and acts pretty much like normal html so when we write things like this like this grid it ends up turning into something else so we can see what it turns into here uh so we have this div with a class of mui grid right the classes are get kind of crazy but and within it we have a field set all right we have a legend a div labels spans more spans svgs inputs right so all of that comes from just adding in in that case the select and these menu items within within this or i'm sorry that was the check boxes we're looking at from just adding in this grid form control form labels and check boxes okay so each one of these is a separate component that exists in a separate javascript file somewhere within our project and in particular most of these exist within the material ui uh package so it's it's in our node modules folder so yeah so it doesn't exactly behave like normal html and there's a lot more to it obviously but it's kind of hidden away and it lets us you know have markup that's that's cleaner and we can still have control over it by passing in these properties so these props will change things and give us some versatility for those components so hopefully that was a decent explanation of a little bit of how react works and hopefully it answered your question if it didn't let me know and then after this pomodoro session then i can go back and try to do a better job okay so if i didn't get to your question right now i will get it to it at the end i know there were a few there at the bottom that i didn't get to and okay so let's let's work on these uh let's move the label for sort by up because right now this this looks kind of odd side by side so we have the labels kind of opposite so let's just switch that around now should be something easy and i think it'll look a lot nicer let's deform upper text let's put that up here see what that does for us there we are we still have some padding issues here let's see what what's going on so right now we have our grid container our grid item form control the text field must be what has the extra padding because right we have grid form control here right so it's the same let's see what kind of class text field let's see what we have going on here on our on our text field styles with margin left marching right with okay we don't have any extra margins or paddings margin or padding happening okay all right let's then look look into uh devtools and see what's going on okay form control the form control here oh let's see do we have a difference here all right this form control it is giving us class name form interesting so this has a in a div within the normal form control div that says page text field so let's check out here what we have going on and we don't have that happening here okay all right let's see all right michael's saying isn't the search field text built into the search element is the select a material ui element i thought it was a material let me double check yeah that's definitely a mature ui element so that's not default select behavior um okay let's see all right so the style of that margin that's this 16 pixel margin here and 8 at the bottom and that's coming from margin normal so why don't we have that it's just it entirely not creating another it's it's creating this item type that's really odd hmm that's really odd all right john hanson is saying add a line items baseline on that wrapping div okay we'll try it out in devtools first and we should have there we go all right not making a difference um the furthest div she's saying this this whole container okay all right let's shout out then whoa baseline okay so all right so we have a line items baseline going now and then oh why is it doing this now so we have this gap right here why do we have this gap css is a fun mystery sometimes all right where's my gap coming from all right is there any difference here we have this align items on here but that's about it uh john asked if i took out that first baseline that i had it i was that's what i was thinking and i think it was here and i must have accidentally set it to left but that's it i mean it's that was where i added it in so it's gone now it's just weird anyone have any idea why why it's doing this excuse me i'm gonna get another drink here while i ponder this problem okay hmm let's play with um let's play with this all right baseline center looks pretty good obviously these don't this doesn't look good and this looks okay right now but if there were only a few items it would take it down well i guess it it would show up in the middle so that wouldn't look good but what we can do is we could change it might be easier to just do it on here let's let's try this for a second let's take out this align item center here and then how do we do it uh align align self center okay so uh if you're using flexbox which i believe the grid system is uh this grid system and material ui is based on flexbox so it's a little misleading because it's calling it grid but it's not using css grid it's using flexbox correct me if i'm wrong but i'm it looks like from the css that everything's based on flex so what we've done is the standard for everything is still in place but on this one particular element we want to change the behavior so we use a line self center and then it can change changes this alignment to center and it doesn't affect any of the other ones does that make sense so let's go with that and let's add i'm not going to make a class i'm going to add this in right on that element because right now it doesn't look like we're going to have to repeat that so let's go over here to our grid and we're going to style we're going to style and then in react when we want to put a style on something we're actually going to make a javascript object so the first set of curly brackets lets us start writing javascript within this jsx so we've switched from kind of like the html like mode and now within these brackets we're in javascript mode so we can write pretty much the same way that we would write normal javascript and then so now i'm creating an object within there and now i can put the the style in there so we're going to do a line self and we can can we need to camel case that right because this is javascript if i put a line hyphen self it's going to think i'm trying to i'll take a line minus self okay so align self and then the next one we're going to make a string so everything unless it's just a pure number needs to be a string on on the right hand side of the colon and so we're going to say center okay and now when we save this will show up like an inline style one here so let's make sure yeah let's uh hit refresh just to verify we'll do an actual page refresh and there we are so you can see we still have this align self center and now that i look at it does that still look a little off to you that actually still looks a little off let's see if we can squish this together to get a better look at uh you know what it's it's not really that off i thought it was farther off so you can see here whoa so you can see here our lines are just a bit off and when it pops up his search field it's a bit off but i i'll live with that for right now um what do you all think i mean just for the sake of moving on i think we can live with that uh so i mean one reason is the screen's never going to be that small showing these side by side like that we'll switch to a mobile version that'll be different so when it's that far apart i don't know i'm okay with it for now it'll probably bother me for a while though let's refresh that again what's going on here the styles are definitely messed up here oh you know what see if that does anything no there we are okay uh i think what happened was the changes oh yeah i pulled in all the changes but i forgot to run yarn uh or npm install so i didn't get the latest version of uh of material ui so that was that was why these the size was all off okay all right now we're good and for these uh filter results for now the only thing i really want to do is decrease the padding in between these i just think it's a bit much once we get more filters in there then we can take a look and and really see like do we need you know how do we need to organize these uh but for now let's just decrease the padding a bit let's see do we still we like that color you know what i also want to change i may not do it today i don't think we'll have time today but i like to change it so that if you click this it only does a search again if there's actually some text in that search field so i i don't want it to just give you like automatically search when there's nothing in the search field oh um yusuf uh asked for it ngrok link yeah i'll paste it in there again i pasted it earlier and i forgot to paste it again uh here you are all right michael creo saying for now added to do yeah actually that's not a bad idea let's add some to do's in here to do more precisely is that how you spell precisely do you all ever just avoid using a word you don't know how to spell because you don't feel like actually verifying how it's spelled um and then what else did i just say we were gonna do oh okay with the search here so let's let's put this up here in the filter filter filter filter filter by category okay all right now let's check out what's going on with our padding here and i just want to see where that all that padding is coming from and it looks like it's not actually padding it's its height so we have margin right margin left right flex vertical in the middle so where where are we getting that height from maybe it's in here height 48 all right if we drop that height let's see what our computed height is okay so why is our computed height let's check back here uh it's saying our computer right is 48. i mean that that does make sense interesting okay let's let's check this out where are we getting the height directly okay so that's on the button icon button which we don't directly have control over here huh menu i don't know that's not it oh we have these okay so within our check box we're going to have to look at the material ui documentation to see if we can change that i realize why they do that they want the check boxes to be easily clickable by someone's finger or thumb uh but if we're on a desktop we don't really need to worry about that uh so yeah so john just i just see in the live chat john's saying the same thing that that is 48 pixels is pretty standard for being clickable so i'm willing to go below that standard only for large screens i do want to keep that standard for smaller screens so actually my pomodoro timer just ran out so i think we'll keep it for now and i'll consider whether we should have right now it really doesn't matter like i mean this is fine my worry is if we get a lot more items it's it's going to be this is going to be too much it'll be overwhelming like the length of all the the options here so i guess this is something we'll revisit once we get more content here and and then we'll see what we need to do so let's commit these changes uh so let's go in our terminal here and for those of you who are new to the terminal and new to git and github i'm going to just explain what i'm doing while i'm doing it so i'm in the terminal i'm in the folder for this project and i'm going to do git status so if you have git installed on your computer you can use the command git so the git status is telling me that two files have changed the search.js file that we've been working in which we expect to change and then this yarn lock and that's whenever i went in and and ran the yarn command it changed this lock file so that's also expected even though we didn't directly uh do anything to log file which generally you shouldn't directly do anything to your lock file anyway so now that we've verified that these are the files that we expected to be changed we can do in this case we're going to run this command called yarn cm now this is probably going to be unfamiliar if you haven't watched any streams because this is kind of a custom setup i'm not we didn't make it all custom but the command whoa we never added it oh okay get ad i need to add first i need to add these files to the staging area so git add and then if i add a little dot a little period after that it'll just stage everything everything that changed so if we do a git status you can see now these have changed to green and they're in the uh staging areas it says changes to be committed now we're going to commit with yarn cm all this is going to do this is just kind of a layer on top of the normal git command so it's just going to walk us through how to write a good commit message and then just run a git commit on that so we're going to say it's a new feature and let's say update search ui and there are no breaking changes and i don't think this affects any issues now it's going to do a bunch of automated testing which this potentially depending on how good of a computer you have this could be a much longer process we did get one warning here since it was a warning we still passed and we can still do this but i believe this is due to our update to the newest version of material ui so for right now it's a warning but at some point we should check this out and see like perhaps this just isn't used anymore uh so we still have it in there and it's kind of a little confusing here to react so we'll see see what that is but not not an emergency type of thing so now that we have our commit message we're going to push this up to github so if you're using github in addition to git which a lot of people do you'll want to make sure you sync up everything you've done locally on your machine with github so that other people can see what you've done and you can access that on other computers as well and and they can too so we're just going to do a git push origin since we're on the master branch it'll automatically push to origin master if we wanted to push this to a different branch we could have done git push origin and then put the name of that other branch that we wanted to push to and that's it all done so now everything we've done today all the updates are available now on the get uh github repo the link is in the description to this video you all can use that do whatever you want with the code it's entirely uh free and open source and uh have have fun with it okay let me go to the live chat now and answer as many questions as as you all have if you do have any more questions please put them in the live chat now uh if you for whatever reason don't want to put your question in the live chat but you still like to ask it just reach out to me on any social media platform uh my the link to my github channel is in the description and from there you can see um on the home page of my channel all my links to all my different social media things so i don't always answer right away but i do try to get back to everyone that asks me a question at some point uh as she says hi i learned c plus plus and java right now i am uh in free code camp hoping i will understand your topic okay great i um yeah i hope that you get something useful out of this feel free to ask as many questions as you need to i'm sure if you've already learned c plus plus and java you'll be able to pick up on this you know pretty quickly oh okay michael just checked out the logitech gold box on amazon so they don't have cams just just mice keyboards and speakers all right well thanks for checking that out for me i do appreciate that um i've got a question which book is best for beginners beginners of c sharp true beginners i i can't um answer that i i have almost no experience with c sharp uh i've just i've done a little bit when i've had to for this job so i don't really know if anybody else has experience with c sharp and knows of any good books please let us know in the live chat newshour asks what motivates you um i think there's a lot of different factors that that can motivate me so it's it's not usually one thing all the time you know it depends so uh obviously the overall you know motivation uh for me is to provide for my family right i mean that's like baseline you got to take care of your your basic needs before you can take care of anything else right so just making sure that my family has enough to eat you know i can put them through school have a house form and things like that right but i could really do that with any job so for specifically for coding what motivates me is number one i really i like to do this i think it's fun are there moments that are frustrating oh absolutely do i sometimes have to work on projects that aren't as fun yeah it happens but overall in general i really like this when when i'm home and on like the very rare occasions when i don't have any kids at home uh like coding is one of the things that i think oh i'm just gonna code like a side project to do something right so i it's it's like a hobby but i get paid for it okay so i do like it uh also um and i hope this doesn't sound bad but uh can competition motivates me right i like i want to be better i don't want to be better in the sense that i enjoy watching other people get beat right like this is you know oneonone competition no i want everybody to get better but like i enjoy being better myself so in the healthiest version of competition where i want to be the best but i want all the competitors to be at the top of their game right so we can all get better together uh so hopefully that makes sense right like there are some people who want to win no matter what and it doesn't matter to them like if their opponent gets the flu and they win they're just as happy well that's that's not me right i'd i wouldn't be happy about that i want everybody to be really good and then push me to be really good too so um i don't know i think that's that's just an exciting thing uh to just try to find out like how much better can i be in building things you know and ultimately being better in web development means making things that are more useful to people there are more easily accessible that make their lives easier that that look beautiful you know that's that's what better means so i'm not gauging success in terms of motivation you know really by money in terms of providing for my family money is you know obviously what i need to gauge that by in addition to being able to spend time with them but then in terms of being motivated by wanting to be better it has almost nothing to do with money it's you know is what i'm making is it quality work you know is it really helping people so anyway i hope that wasn't too long of an answer for you all but those are kind of some of my my motivators and sometimes when you're just down you got to make up your own motivators like or you gotta have help so like you gotta drink an energy drink or give yourself like little things like okay if i every time i finish a new pomodoro session uh i'm gonna like eat a bite of chocolate or do something that uh that you wanna do like i've actually done it before where like every time i had a five minute break in my pomodoro session i would watch five minutes of a netflix show which is silly to watch five minutes at a time but like that was my reward to get me through that that little portion i think at the time i was putting in like crazy hours so it's just like anything that i could do to just uh keep going so anyway those are some of the things that motivate me and on any given day i might be more or less motivated by one of those things but you know together it really keeps me on track and passionate about what i'm doing let me know what you all think is motivating for you i'm really interested to hear what motivates other people so let me know in the chat uh or in the comments the video or even uh in social media somehow tag me in in it or whatever you can even dm me if you want let's see okay uh why why didn't you join any company well i mean i'm not i work for university um so i guess that counts as a company right john hanson says for mobile just use a modal for filters and sorting yeah i could i'm either going to use a drop down or in material ui you can actually have two different drawers come out so i could have the one drawer come out for the main menu and i could have a drawer come out of the other side the right side for the filters so i just have to figure out what what button are people going to press to get to those filters that might be kind of cool i'll have to remember that michael says a bunch of new people in here today that's a good thing yeah definitely for everyone that's new here welcome i really appreciate you watching i know towards the end here we've kind of dropped off so i wish i would have acknowledged you all earlier when there were you know about twice as many people in here uh but if you stuck around if you're here uh yeah thank you so much for watching and i really want to be receptive to what you all want so any advice you have for me or any questions please let me know i'm i'm usually super nice about everything so i'm cool with criticism you know try to be nice but if you must be mean i'm not going to cry at least on camera but but anyway i'm serious i want to make this better so let me know what would you all want you know what kind of things you like what kind of things you don't like all right not too many questions left let's see noble and savage says woot hi all hey how's it going thanks for joining us oh john hanson says use a negative margin left on the input titles this won't impact on the standard clickable area okay i think i like i like that idea well i'm not gonna do it right now um but when it comes time for us to really start getting detailed on this as we get more of uh the filters on here yeah i'll definitely want to mess with this to to see if it looks better you know with them being closer that's a good trick uh nino says do you know when why um just for the terminal vibe venv what's i'm not sure what that is was it supposed to be end i don't know uh in python can't be active from the terminal uh in visual studio code i i have no idea i i haven't done anything with python for years so i really have no ideas i'm sorry michael says i've been playing around with graphql slash react for a day or so so when i think like i understand what's going on watch out you might have a harsher 2.0 all right i'm looking forward to it yeah unfortunately i had to stream later today because i had other stuff going on so i know harsh it's most likely sleeping at least i hope he's sleeping it should be it's really late where he's at uh so i'm gonna try to stream earlier uh tomorrow if i can and i know he's busy right now with school so maybe he can join us for those of you who don't know harshad he's a veteran i guess of the channel and very outspoken in helping me when i'm doing something wrong uh but it it truly is it is helpful michael says but i'm three times his age so that's kind of creepy that's true yeah harshit is only 16. um and actually when he was 15 when he started watching the the streams and uh very smart i think he's gonna he's gonna be a very good programmer if he keeps going at this pace he's already good let's see carlos says jesse can you explain the yarn command on git oh yeah for sure let me explain that that again so what we did here on the terminal let me go up and show you um so instead of doing a regular git commit we did yarn cm and then we got these little prompts that basically writes a commit message for us and then the commit actually happens so let me scroll down i wonder if you would be able to see it yeah so here's where the commit happens so you see this is the commit message that we actually got feet right for new feature because we said yes we selected that option and then for our message we put in update search ui and we said no to everything else so this is our message so it creates a message for us depending on what answers we give to the questions so it's just a little additional thing that helps us make a nice uniform commit message all right michael says i'm out it's been fun hey uh see you later michael thanks for joining us so that's what we're doing if you want to know more about exactly what's going on behind the scenes i would check out the package json file let's see where that's at our package.json yeah so here's our package.json file and down here we have this cm and that does a get cz and we're using committed so check out committed and if you want to know more about how to do stuff like this and how to set this up and i believe there was a pull request for this so if you check through the pull request for this project on github you'll find one that has to do with this and there's probably some more info on on how to use it there oh carla says awesome thanks for explaining i always have a hard time thinking what to put in a commit uh with what i'm doing yeah me too for sure so this does help a bit it helps you kind of think through okay what am i what am i doing here so uh yeah it's definitely a really cool addition to the project oh cool carlos says awesome class had a great time learned a lot i'm glad i'm really glad um you know join us again if you can sometime i'd love to have you back java bat says would you recommend using react with es6 plus typescript i don't know that i can recommend it because i haven't really used it i've looked at other repos that use it i haven't in terms of typescript like es6 with react for sure for sure use es6 with react it's it's a lot better if you take advantage of what's available in es6 if you're not familiar with es6 it's kind of the newer things that are available to use with javascript sometimes called uh es2015 i believe es 2015 is is actually the the official name for it but most people say es6 uh in terms of typescript though i don't i don't know enough i don't have enough uh experience working with it to really tell you if it would be better it would probably depend on your project honestly to to determine like how much benefit would you get out of it if anybody else uses typescript with react and can give a better answer that question uh please you know let us know in the chat uh bhuvana asks does this session go on every day um yeah er monday through friday i try to do a session every day i don't always get to do a session every day but that's my goal uh viral only says hi thanks for the session uh you're welcome thanks for watching uh john hanson says i just realized that by using the array function find it totally isn't supported at all in internet explorer good that's i'm of the opinion that we're not doing our users any favors by supporting outdated browsers especially browsers that are so outdated that it's security risk to the user we're enabling them to uh keep doing things that are bad for them right to keep doing these bad security practices they probably don't even know it but if more sites i mean this may be controversial but if more sites just wouldn't work for them at all maybe it would spur them to say hey something's wrong with my computer or my browser and actually learn more about it and update if we keep supporting all these old browsers then we're just enabling hackers or whoever to take advantage of people who know a little bit less about computers instead we should educate our users with a little message or something saying please update your browser for your security and for a better experience also i think we got to think about like what is the reason behind why we want to support these older browsers right mistakenly we may be thinking like oh we want to include everybody and we want everybody to be able to experience our site i mean that's a good thought but you know at the bottom of it at the root of it especially if we're one if we're selling something are we just supporting older browsers because we want the most number of people possibly able to buy our product or do something online no i'm not saying that's what everybody does but at some point somebody higher up is probably thinking that like more people coming to our site equals more money so we want as many people as possible without really thinking like okay but is that with what's best for the user so that's that's my reasoning i'm not trying to be mean by not supporting older browsers but my reasoning behind not supporting older browsers is genuinely being concerned that people have no idea what kind of danger they're putting their themselves and their computers in by using such outdated browsers when there are so many security safeguards in the newer versions anyway i know i've talked about that before in the stream so if you've heard me say that before sorry for repeating myself um but that's my view on it i will say this if you do it like that and you don't support browsers um it's it's probably good to have some sort of check for a browser and display some sort of message to let the user know what's going on if the site just breaks and doesn't work that's not a good user experience at least if you have a very polite message explaining the situation to the user then you are actually providing some help so we'll have to remember to put that in this project or else i'm going to sound like a big hypocrite so let's plan on doing that i have done it for some of my projects uh i admit i don't always remember to do that and sometimes i do end up supporting older browsers occasionally i i don't do it a lot sometimes i just do it kind of accidentally because build tools like a lot of build tools take care of that for you but anyway i'm going to move on noble and savage says i met someone today that uses ie there's a lot of people that use ie on campus here that i run into always amazed john anson says there's a lot of elderly people still using internet explorer eight yeah somebody on campus was using internet explorer eight and had a hard time trying to use some of the sites that i built and um finally realized that they were on internet explorer eight and that was the problem java bat says do you have something like a set of css classes which you are using as a basis for every project uh yes something like that so uh depending on what we're doing if we're doing a react project we're we're always using material ui which comes with its own set i mean it's it's like bootstrap or materialize but for react projects if we're doing a nonreact project we use materialized css and then we also have some classes that we just kind of carry over to new projects we usually use sas and we have some sas variables for different colors and things that we carry over so we do have a style guide that really needs updated right now so i kind of don't even want to give you the address to it because it needs updated so badly but that also is the idea behind it is to include some css that you can reuse on on other projects and and make all the websites will have the same kind of like standard look and ui so that users you know they don't have to relearn how your ui works for every different site you know it shouldn't be like that and within one organization there should be some standardization you know for the sake of of uh lessening the confusion of the users and for for brand identity purposes um let's see john hanson says internet explorer is at 2.8 percent worldwide oh i'm glad i'm glad it's it's only 2.8 percent uh java bats also says svgs are always a problem for me on internet explorer interesting i'll have to check that out i haven't to take the truth i don't really test on internet explorer very much anymore so i just haven't noticed if my svgs are working john hanson is talking about says inline svgs have less problems on ie maybe that's why i do like to use inline svgs whenever i can java says thanks for the answer oh yeah no problem no problem um all right cool i think i got through everything if i miss your question for some reason just uh put in the comments or send it to me some other way and i'll try to give you a good answer if i can uh i do believe i'll be able to stream tomorrow not sure what time yet i'll let you know tomorrow morning at some point um and if you subscribe to the free code camp channel and turn on notifications you'll get notified whenever i do a live stream i also do live streams and videos on my own channel so if you're interested you can subscribe and get notifications on that channel as well i i'm gonna get ready to put out a new video soon because it's been since the beginning of march since i've done a video on my own channel so it's coming up soon if anybody really really wants me to do a video on a specific topic uh let me know somehow uh within the next day or two because i i want to get a video out here soon um let's see other than that i do announce on twitter and usually on instagram when i'm gonna stream so whatever method you prefer to get your news uh please you know follow me on those places and that's the best way to find out what time i'm streaming um yeah all right that's it for me thank you all again for watching and for being involved in the chat and for all your your help as always and i'll be back tomorrow until then have a wonderful day
