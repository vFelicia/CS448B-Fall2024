00:05 - hey everybody welcome to live-streaming
00:08 - with Jessie today we're gonna continue
00:12 - on with what we've been doing the last
00:13 - two streams and that's working on this
00:16 - homepage
00:18 - yesterday we we got some cards put in
00:25 - like a masonry layout but we were having
00:30 - some trouble getting some of the cards
00:33 - to take up the full width of the columns
00:35 - that we wanted them to be in so I
00:37 - actually found a fix for that that was
00:40 - really simple and I don't know I'm gonna
00:44 - lie didn't think of it yesterday or you
00:46 - know maybe one of you thought of it were
00:48 - trying to tell me in the chat and I just
00:49 - was not getting it but I'm gonna show
00:53 - you what that fixes and then we're gonna
00:54 - get started and and finished this page
00:57 - and it was so simple I just I'm almost
01:02 - embarrassed now how simple it was but
01:06 - let me get started oh there's a lot in
01:09 - the live chat already okay there were
01:13 - some questions about whether or not
01:14 - beginners can watch this stream I would
01:16 - say beginners will probably get
01:19 - something out of this stream they may
01:22 - not understand everything some streams
01:24 - are more beginner friendly than others
01:27 - this stream maybe it's like middle of
01:29 - the road the the whole point of me doing
01:33 - these videos when I first thought
01:36 - thought up you know the idea of doing
01:39 - these was just to see what it's like for
01:43 - me to do my job as a front-end developer
01:45 - and especially to help those people who
01:48 - are beginners or maybe people who are
01:50 - freelance and always work alone I know I
01:55 - I still don't know what it's like for
01:58 - developers you know who like work on a
02:00 - team at a big company you know what
02:02 - their day-in day-out job is like so I
02:05 - thought I'd be cool people to see that
02:07 - but not just seeing me but specifically
02:11 - see me mess up and how I work
02:14 - that and I thought maybe it would give
02:18 - beginners more confidence that you know
02:21 - seeing somebody who's getting paid to do
02:23 - this mess up so much maybe they would
02:27 - think hey like I'm way better than this
02:30 - guy I definitely can get it tough
02:32 - so anyway because of that I think
02:36 - beginners could get something from any
02:38 - of these shows but if you're looking for
02:41 - a tutorial this is not the right stream
02:43 - there are a lot of other great tutorials
02:45 - on the free code camp Channel and on
02:47 - other channels on YouTube but you
02:52 - sometimes it's somewhat like a tutorial
02:55 - but I I there's no way I could in good
02:58 - conscience call this a tutorial we just
03:01 - we mess up way too much and it's not
03:02 - really that structured so anyway if you
03:07 - are a beginner and you're watching feel
03:09 - free to stick around love to have you
03:12 - here and feel free to ask questions I
03:14 - don't answer questions right away
03:16 - I split it up into Pomodoro sessions or
03:20 - 25-minute periods of coding and then I'd
03:22 - do five minutes of question-and-answer
03:24 - and then at the very end if there's any
03:26 - questions left over I get to all those
03:29 - questions so just be patient if you ask
03:33 - a question occasionally someone will ask
03:35 - a question and they'll keep asking it
03:37 - over and over and wondering if I'm going
03:39 - to answer their question well I don't
03:42 - even see it because I'm doing the coding
03:43 - so just be patient I'll get to it
03:48 - let's see Michael McCrea says it's
03:53 - usually tutorial for you Jesse that's it
03:55 - that's right
03:56 - these videos are a tutorial for me
03:58 - because you all helped me out so much I
04:01 - learned how I should say truth yeah
04:06 - Irish it has contributed significantly
04:09 - to my learning into my project so yeah
04:15 - glad you're here today are you sure I
04:17 - miss you yesterday I was trying to do it
04:19 - a little bit earlier so you wouldn't
04:21 - have to stay up so late okay all right
04:26 - one more thing before we start
04:28 - I made a video and I I posted it on my
04:33 - youtube channel so there's a link to
04:35 - that I think in the description to this
04:37 - video so this is the free code camp
04:40 - channel I do most of my live streams
04:42 - here but if I come out with videos on
04:44 - other topics or a tutorial I put that on
04:48 - my own personal channel so check that
04:51 - out if you want the video is on getting
04:55 - motivated after the holidays so it's
05:00 - just I I think I mentioned this
05:02 - yesterday to you all but just a really
05:05 - short it's like three minutes of how I
05:08 - got through my sluggishness after the
05:12 - holidays and getting back into it so
05:14 - maybe it'll help somebody else out if
05:17 - you're trying to get back in the you
05:19 - know in decoding after taking a little
05:21 - break okay let's see someone asks about
05:29 - languages frameworks we're using mostly
05:31 - JavaScript and react how Michael said up
05:36 - there there's no bird in the background
05:38 - here my I had I actually went and
05:43 - consulted I did some consulting work and
05:47 - so I just came in from outside and
05:50 - there's snow everywhere so the snow is
05:52 - melting on the bottom of my shoes and
05:54 - it's my shoes are squeaking on the floor
05:57 - as I kind of shift it out in my chair so
06:01 - I apologize for the weird sound that's
06:05 - just the squeaking of my shoes
06:13 - all right so that's all let me let me
06:22 - show you are the screen there we go okay
06:31 - so here's what we've got so far so not a
06:35 - whole lot also I forgot to push the
06:36 - changes to the github repo from
06:39 - yesterday so I apologize to anyone who
06:41 - tried to check out the code it wasn't up
06:43 - to date I pushed them this morning so it
06:46 - is up to date now so you can see we have
06:50 - these cart these three cards here were
06:53 - really thin now they're they're taking
06:58 - up the full width like they should we
06:59 - still need to get this gutter sorted out
07:01 - and we'll do that probably the first
07:03 - thing we work on but I want to show you
07:05 - how I did this so all I added to each
07:10 - one of these grid items here not to the
07:15 - Container grid which I think we removed
07:16 - anyway but today these great items that
07:18 - we were putting that we wanted to take
07:25 - up a certain amount of space so full
07:27 - width quarter with things like that we
07:30 - added this grid item fix class and I'll
07:32 - show you what it was really easy grid
07:36 - item fix gives it a width of 100% that's
07:40 - it so if you I don't know if you all
07:44 - remember from yesterday when we checked
07:45 - in dev tools on the classes that were
07:48 - being applied to that that div it was
07:54 - applying a max width based on you know
07:59 - what was supposed to be so if we wanted
08:01 - it to be fourth of the screen it was
08:04 - saying max width 25% but it had no width
08:08 - property so all I did was say okay well
08:13 - let's put with 100% it'll still be
08:15 - limited by that max width property right
08:18 - and that's it worth so it's a simple fix
08:22 - now it's not universe right so if we
08:26 - wanted to use this grid
08:27 - system on other pages we would have to
08:29 - make sure we keep carrying that over so
08:31 - depending on what we want to do with it
08:33 - we may want to come up with a different
08:34 - way to implement this kind of like
08:36 - globally but for right now this works
08:39 - fine for what we're gonna be doing today
08:42 - so ended up being just very simple and
08:49 - yeah sometimes that happens you know
08:52 - sometimes you gotta sleep on it and it's
08:57 - it worked out okay
09:02 - let's see let me start this Pomodoro
09:08 - timer and let's get that this gutter
09:13 - worked out to about you know the way
09:17 - that we want it so I do want to work
09:20 - within material UI here's the docks so
09:25 - if you want to follow on with the
09:26 - documentation it's material - UI
09:29 - - next comm and actually I'm just gonna
09:34 - paste this in right now so I can just go
09:38 - right to it and you know what let me
09:42 - sorry
09:45 - let me run and rock as well I forgot to
09:48 - do that yesterday
09:51 - I think I have it up here I do
09:56 - nope
10:03 - I think we're running this on for 3,000
10:09 - yep we are alright so I'm gonna have a
10:12 - link for you all to view this on your
10:17 - machine as well the link doesn't wasn't
10:26 - working huh that's crazy
10:33 - it's the same length
10:42 - okay I don't know why the link isn't
10:45 - working
10:47 - but that that's exactly the that's
10:52 - really weird all right so maybe it is
10:57 - working for some people I mean if you go
11:00 - to the main site and navigate to there
11:02 - hopefully it will now it works okay
11:05 - all right seems like it's working now
11:09 - maybe it's YouTube redirects oh okay all
11:24 - right so here's what I want to check out
11:25 - see if there is some sort of gutter kind
11:32 - of built into the API maybe space space
11:34 - between I haven't components that
11:39 - contain anything five minutes
11:43 - okay this you can only use this on the
11:45 - container component and we got rid of
11:48 - our container component so that may not
11:51 - work
12:07 - all right maybe we'll all right so I
12:14 - don't think we can put the container
12:18 - grid back no that's not the right one
12:22 - yeah we did get rid of it down here I
12:25 - don't think we're gonna be able to put
12:27 - the container back without messing
12:29 - things up so let's try this see if it
12:34 - works let's just throw margin on this
12:40 - element we'll just give it this goes 16
12:43 - pixels for now so just 16 pixels all
12:45 - around and let's see if this actually
12:48 - works I'm skeptical that this will work
12:51 - well with what we have going on huh Wow
12:59 - not bad okay but one thing it did do is
13:03 - it messed up our our column see so move
13:10 - this over so if we change it to padding
13:13 - maybe maybe it will have better results
13:20 - there we go okay so actually this is a
13:27 - really good kind of beginners lesson
13:29 - with CSS so the reason why it didn't
13:33 - work with margin but it does work with
13:34 - padding is because actually let me open
13:40 - up dev tools it'll be easier to explain
13:42 - this with with this here okay so you can
13:49 - see this this displays an element and
13:52 - I'm I'm actually going to get the card
13:55 - here so it's displaying okay so this is
14:01 - actually what we just did we just added
14:04 - a padding of 16 on to this so what it
14:09 - does here when it calculates the width
14:11 - of this item any padding is actually
14:18 - counted
14:20 - as the item with so when we're saying
14:24 - elsewhere that we only want this this
14:27 - container to take up 50% of this space
14:35 - it's going to include the padding in
14:38 - there when we put it as margin it
14:41 - doesn't include margin in the width as
14:44 - the width of the container so it was
14:47 - saying okay we're gonna have this take
14:49 - up just this component alone plus
14:52 - whatever padding we had which happened
14:53 - to me nothing but we're gonna take all
14:56 - this and make this the full 50% width
15:00 - but then when you add the margin in it
15:02 - ends up being a little bit more so maybe
15:05 - 52 percent with right so then if we add
15:08 - it up all the three elements which
15:11 - should be 25 25 and 50% we ended up
15:16 - instead of getting 100% which we should
15:19 - have we would end up getting something
15:21 - like I don't know 110 percent that's why
15:24 - this other one got pushed down to here
15:28 - because we gone over the percentage
15:32 - right so really you know there's it's
15:38 - not always obvious on when's the right
15:40 - time to use margin and when's the right
15:42 - time to use padding but in this case
15:44 - it's clear padding is giving us what we
15:48 - want here and margin did not there's
15:52 - price of other cases we can think of
15:54 - where you want to use one over the other
15:55 - for sure and there are some cases where
15:58 - you could use one or the other and it
15:59 - won't really make a difference
16:02 - Jony eight says is that still the case
16:04 - in border-box
16:05 - that's a good point let's let's mess
16:08 - around a little bit with that just you
16:10 - know since we started let's switch this
16:14 - and use okay so it is it's already using
16:17 - border box let's have it use content box
16:24 - this is going to
16:28 - and we'll use content box and then we'll
16:33 - switch the margin we'll switch this to a
16:36 - margin okay so now this is using margin
16:43 - and they're also using content box so
16:48 - let's move this back to border box and
16:51 - see what happens all right so we're
16:58 - getting this and I'm just confirming
17:02 - that this is we're actually getting the
17:04 - behavior we didn't want let's see if it
17:06 - changes with content bugs okay it isn't
17:14 - changing with content bugs and let's see
17:19 - what happens if we keep content box with
17:22 - our padding and let's switch it up okay
17:32 - all right that's where the difference is
17:34 - all right so just to verify before I
17:37 - explain this because I don't explain the
17:38 - wrong wrong thing I'm gonna switch this
17:40 - back to border and there we go okay
17:47 - so let me go back to here so we could
17:53 - see so here's what happens when we use
17:56 - border box which border box is usually
17:59 - the default correct I'm I'm almost
18:04 - positive that normally it's most sites I
18:06 - work on his border box so a border box
18:09 - works normally as I explained before
18:10 - when you switch to content box then what
18:15 - happens is the the actual width of the
18:20 - content is taken as the width right
18:25 - padding then acts like margin did in our
18:28 - first example so now the padding is
18:33 - actually in addition so the full 50% in
18:38 - the case of this code
18:39 - dear the full 50% is taking up just by
18:42 - this part this content and then in
18:45 - addition to that there is padding and
18:48 - that is gonna add you know 52 percent or
18:53 - something right it's gonna be 52 percent
18:55 - somewhere around there so if you're
18:59 - still having trouble you know with
19:01 - something like this make sure you check
19:03 - your box sizing as well I tend to stick
19:06 - with border box for pretty much
19:08 - everything I rarely even think about
19:11 - this it's not it's not an issue normally
19:13 - but thanks for bringing that up Johnny
19:18 - that definitely could have been
19:20 - confusing if someone was working with
19:24 - something that was set to content box
19:26 - instead of border box all right so let
19:33 - me know if you all appreciate some of
19:36 - those that little kind of side side bar
19:40 - there to explain things I'll try to do
19:43 - that more if if you think it's helpful
19:45 - if you'd rather me just get to the point
19:47 - and start coding that that's cool too
19:50 - Wow
19:51 - my network I apologize if the video
19:56 - quality was bad I just glanced at my
19:58 - network and it was terrible it seems
20:02 - like it's back now at normal so
20:13 - let's see I just wanna make sure I did
20:19 - answer that question adequately
20:32 - okay Johnny says thank you for
20:36 - explaining that it's just like you Arjun
20:38 - yeah yes
20:47 - okay cool so let's let's move on then
20:52 - well let's let's make sure this width is
20:53 - actually what we want I I think that was
21:02 - okay oh and we still we need to make
21:07 - sure we we have our items take up the
21:13 - proper space on smaller screens
21:24 - now that's interesting it shifts over
21:27 - this way I would think that it would
21:30 - shift it would go this way from left to
21:32 - right it's good to know for a layout
21:35 - though all right
21:41 - actually Harsha's saying
21:43 - use materialized you're using many
21:46 - selectors on those divs the necessary
21:49 - okay so hardship thinks we should just
21:51 - use the materialized column classes okay
22:01 - so hard
22:02 - prefers using the materialized grid
22:04 - maybe we'll switch to that I'm not gonna
22:07 - switch to it on the stream right now
22:08 - because it's mostly just copy and paste
22:10 - way but that might not be a bad idea to
22:14 - switch to we already talked about
22:15 - yesterday wolf why we might switch to
22:17 - that so I'm still open to that there was
22:22 - just a part of me that really wanted to
22:23 - see if I could get this to work and and
22:27 - we have a a solution so we'll see if the
22:31 - solution continues to work if we run
22:33 - into too many bugs we'll see how that
22:36 - how leg goes okay so we do have extra
22:43 - small/small actually we we already have
22:51 - we already have the right the right
22:58 - columns on here so that it should be
23:01 - full width let's see what's going on
23:03 - there so we may have found our first bug
23:06 - oh there we go now it is working it was
23:09 - just set to extra small so I think
23:17 - yeah let's let's set this a bit
23:22 - differently yeah so let's see for a
23:30 - small screens right now we have small I
23:34 - mean okay for all our smalls where we
23:36 - have it set to three we're gonna change
23:39 - things up a bit
23:40 - and we're gonna go let's let's try first
23:51 - let's try six for small and then medium
23:55 - I assume medium is MD we'll find out in
23:59 - a second if that works for mediums then
24:02 - we'll go with our three with our quarter
24:04 - so that should be a nicer transition on
24:09 - small screens and
24:23 - okay
24:25 - I made sure to see how this how this
24:28 - works okay so here's our large screen
24:33 - it's like normal see what break point is
24:38 - ok so around 930 pixels somewhere on
24:44 - there 9 950 we have our small break
24:51 - point and that's when it goes down to 2
24:56 - now we go down to 1 okay so it looks
25:03 - like it's still these are still too thin
25:06 - even on our medium size so I think we're
25:11 - gonna have to we're gonna we're gonna
25:16 - have to bump that up another screen size
25:19 - another screen width so let's take our
25:24 - mediums we'll take our mediums and
25:31 - change them to large and I think that'll
25:35 - work
25:46 - okay
25:49 - so now we should get there we go we get
25:51 - to split a lot earlier we get it up
25:54 - there around 1200 pixels and that that's
25:59 - nicer now we don't have content
26:00 - extending out over that card so these
26:03 - are still you know a bit narrow here
26:06 - once you get down to 1200 pixels but you
26:12 - know we'll see what happens with the
26:15 - with the content when we get real
26:19 - content in there then I think we can do
26:22 - more adjustments for now that's only
26:24 - adjust when I really want to do no sense
26:26 - and really you know getting too detailed
26:28 - with this when we're still just kind of
26:32 - experimenting okay is everybody cool was
26:37 - that it was that somewhat
26:39 - straightforward let me know in the live
26:42 - chat I'll check back in a minute and see
26:45 - if anyone needs me to explain that a bit
26:47 - more
26:58 - and see
27:08 - all right cool so let's add a few more
27:11 - cards in I definitely want to add in a
27:14 - card for video and yeah I'm not sure if
27:25 - I want to keep this cards are right with
27:30 - the image and then like text potentially
27:34 - down here but it might not be a bad idea
27:36 - to just have one you know just with an
27:39 - image in it maybe we could try one out
27:41 - with an image and a text overlay that
27:45 - might not be a bad idea okay
27:57 - alright let's try that out
28:04 - so let's grab down here we're only using
28:09 - up on the large you're really using up
28:14 - 25% because we didn't put another card
28:18 - down here so let's grab another card
28:24 - actually let's grab this wow that's too
28:27 - much I don't want to get that all that
28:29 - let's grab this card here and I'm gonna
28:33 - put another one right in here on top of
28:36 - this and let's make this let's take away
28:41 - this large here so this is going to end
28:43 - up being 50% of the screen for most
28:47 - screen sizes and for the card content
28:53 - this is what I want to do I I don't
28:56 - think I saw anything specifically for a
28:59 - video let me see where we have our image
29:04 - so we have card media let's check out
29:11 - the API for the card media and see if we
29:13 - can't add a video if not then we'll just
29:18 - do our thing the only I was worried
29:20 - about is there's padding built in here
29:23 - to this card content
29:25 - I think there's padding built in the
29:28 - card content so we would want our video
29:30 - to go completely like end-to-end let's
29:36 - see where's my okay here it is
29:45 - so let's check out our cards API and
29:52 - card frog Wow
29:58 - it seriously it that's all we have we
30:03 - can also just use paper to make kind of
30:05 - our own video component if we want to I
30:09 - was just kind of hoping that they
30:11 - already had something built-in to the
30:14 - cards but it won't be too much extra
30:18 - work if they don't okay so here's our
30:20 - media okay so it's just showing an image
30:28 - our media API yes
30:46 - okay so it looks like we can do
30:48 - something with with video and the shoes
30:51 - for you
30:53 - that's it back right
31:15 - yeah
31:25 - all right so I all right it's not as
31:29 - straightforward as I thought let me
31:31 - check the live chat and see if anybody
31:36 - is reading this kind of differently than
31:39 - me it seems like from from this part it
31:44 - says in that you know a video would be
31:48 - possible to put in here but I don't know
31:54 - it's it's not 100% clear to me let's see
32:02 - ok hard says if you set the
32:05 - component as video and the source to
32:07 - video but this will give you html5
32:10 - player ok we'll probably want to end up
32:13 - using the YouTube player so maybe it'll
32:18 - be better if ok harsh it says you can't
32:21 - add the iframe yeah ok maybe we'll try
32:26 - it out with a YouTube embed ok cool
32:31 - so let me grab the YouTube embed code I
32:36 - have I have the video that I just did up
32:41 - here so let's grab the code on my other
32:44 - screen it's got the code from here
32:52 - so you don't want to share we want to
32:54 - embed
33:12 - okay
33:19 - all right so let's see how we're gonna
33:20 - do this I should said shameless plug
33:25 - yellow yeah yes it's by the way check
33:31 - out my video um alright which one are we
33:36 - just coffee
33:37 - I should have coffee the one that had
33:39 - card media was I thinking alright
33:43 - [Music]
33:47 - Media and we gonna do
33:57 - what was that source
34:12 - see so do we put so I keep flying back
34:17 - and forth hear me do I need to put
34:21 - source iframe here or what I generally
34:31 - like the documentation they have for
34:33 - this but this is a little big for me
34:36 - maybe I'm just not getting it maybe it's
34:39 - more obvious to you all
34:41 - whoa that's not what I wanted to do what
34:46 - else do we need to put in an image a
34:50 - shrinkies a Dom element or a component
34:54 - okay let's do
35:13 - two years working on it okay so I guess
35:18 - within component that's where I would
35:20 - put this
35:36 - is it gonna let me just in suscribe
35:46 - let's see
35:53 - oh okay so hard should say in the source
35:57 - put the URL in the component put the
35:59 - iframe all right Thank You hard
36:08 - so let me let me just paste this in here
36:12 - quickly so I can grab the source
36:25 - and now I will say iframe
36:31 - [Music]
36:43 - okay
36:47 - see what we get uh-oh I'm not bad it's
36:52 - not great but it's not bad so we need we
36:59 - need that is something right yeah I
37:06 - think it says the props will useful to
37:11 - extend the style applied to components
37:14 - okay
37:31 - alright let's see how this this would
37:37 - look
37:52 - but there's something it's going off the
37:56 - page because I just changed it in dev
37:57 - tools and I didn't give see what if I
38:01 - adjust it see now the masonry has a
38:05 - chance to lay it out properly but yeah
38:10 - cool play right in there all right not
38:14 - bad it still has some weird stuff going
38:17 - on around the edges some space down here
38:23 - that we don't want so I need some work
38:26 - but it's not it's mostly what we want
38:30 - okay all right let's see my timer went
38:40 - off let's do a short break here and let
38:42 - me go to the live chat
38:46 - [Music]
39:08 - okay goog GI o or GI so correct me if
39:17 - I'm pronouncing that wrong but gog asks
39:22 - have a question float vs. inline-block
39:26 - using floats is not too old comparing to
39:30 - the inline-block same can be achieved
39:32 - with inline-block as using floats but
39:34 - less code no need of clear fixes thanks
39:40 - yeah so is there are a lot of different
39:45 - ways to position things in CSS so yeah
39:47 - some things are considered older to use
39:52 - than others I'm of the opinion generally
39:55 - that if it works it works right it's
40:00 - fine to use the issue gets in some cases
40:04 - what about performance you know does it
40:07 - cut down on on your speed most sites
40:09 - don't need to worry about it that much
40:11 - you know but some sites you know even
40:16 - shaving milliseconds is is important
40:18 - right so you generally do want to know
40:20 - about what the best ways are to use and
40:24 - some of the newer ways to do things
40:26 - instead of using floats or inline block
40:30 - is to use flexbox we're now the new CSS
40:36 - grid and so it's good to know flexbox
40:40 - and grid for instance you know if you're
40:43 - gonna do anything with react native all
40:46 - the positioning is through flexbox right
40:49 - so it would be a good idea to just you
40:52 - know start learning that and start
40:55 - positioning with that but if you're not
40:58 - good with that kind of stuff yet and you
41:00 - got to do something then you know the
41:02 - older ways will work it's it's okay but
41:06 - as kind of people start using flexbox
41:10 - and grid more and more it's going to be
41:11 - harder to understand what's going on and
41:13 - other projects if you're still kind of
41:16 - using the older stuff off the top of my
41:18 - head I don't really know
41:20 - with the differences in terms of you
41:23 - know speed right but that would be what
41:28 - I would look at when I would if I was
41:30 - really trying to decide okay which one's
41:31 - best which one I need to use if it was
41:33 - going to be a big deal I would check
41:35 - that out also you had mentioned you
41:41 - could use less code with one or the
41:44 - other no need for clear fixes that that
41:46 - is another thing to take into
41:47 - consideration how difficult is it to
41:50 - implement one versus the other
41:51 - can you save lines of code so anyway
41:58 - hopefully that kind of answered your
42:00 - question a bit but I mean if you're
42:03 - using something that out that is
42:04 - considered somewhat older you hear that
42:06 - don't feel too bad about it right I mean
42:09 - you know to build stuff we're all doing
42:12 - things the best way we know how the idea
42:15 - is that we keep learning things but you
42:16 - can't learn all the new stuff all at
42:18 - once right you just keep adding on every
42:21 - project you try to learn some different
42:23 - and use newer stuff right so you may
42:27 - only learn one new thing on the next
42:28 - project but you know eventually you know
42:32 - you'll keep up and you'll keep learning
42:34 - new things let's see
42:40 - Vinnie ak asked how did you MIT how did
42:43 - you fix image with in masonry I just
42:48 - added I'll show you right now I just
42:50 - added to our grid items I just added a
42:57 - width of 100% and then I added some
42:59 - padding one on top of that that was all
43:02 - it took it ended up being so simple
43:07 - let's see Harshit says I consider this
43:10 - doing work to achieve nothing you are a
43:13 - programmer use the shortest and bug-free
43:16 - way possible I'm telling you this with
43:18 - my previous experience in the bulletin
43:20 - project okay so you're talking to honey
43:23 - that you're talking about using
43:26 - the grid system that comes with masonry
43:28 - or I'm sorry Latino UI versus just using
43:32 - the column classes from materialize
43:35 - that's a good point I do remember that
43:39 - that it ended up being a real pain to
43:42 - try to get that to work with that
43:43 - bulletin project so we may end up
43:47 - switching to that then so I'm gonna have
43:50 - to take a look I'll take a look at the
43:53 - bulletin project to see how it was done
43:55 - there I am way more comfortable with the
43:58 - materialized column classes really so it
44:02 - will be easier for me in the long run to
44:05 - just use materialized so but anyway like
44:08 - I said I'm not gonna switch it right now
44:10 - on the stream I think we're still we are
44:12 - still doing some valuable stuff because
44:15 - we've explained like we got to explain
44:19 - all about padding and margins and stuff
44:21 - right and to be honest with you the
44:25 - purpose of what we're doing right now
44:27 - and in heart should I explain this
44:29 - yesterday so you might not have caught
44:32 - it already I'm just trying to get my
44:35 - boss something to look at so it's
44:37 - intended now it's intended that
44:39 - everything's gonna be refactored
44:40 - significantly once we decide on
44:42 - something so everything we're doing
44:44 - right now may end up getting scrapped
44:46 - and we don't use any of it okay so at
44:50 - this point that's why it may not
44:52 - actually be worth it for me to switch to
44:54 - materialise called classes right now
44:57 - because we may not even use this at all
45:00 - hopefully I'm sure this to my boss soon
45:03 - get some feedback and then we'll know at
45:06 - that point that's probably the better
45:07 - time to make the decision but at least
45:10 - we have you know I and and I know you
45:14 - already know cuz you try them both but
45:15 - now you know we have got along the
45:17 - stream a nice comparison of you know you
45:22 - can go back and watch the old stream see
45:24 - how we did it with the column classes
45:26 - for materialized and now we could see
45:27 - how we deal with the grid I don't know
45:30 - you know how I am I always like to try
45:32 - two different ways and see which one
45:33 - works out can't always do that
45:37 - sometimes there's just not enough time
45:38 - but in this case I think it's worthwhile
45:42 - the process of going through it I think
45:44 - is worthwhile it may take a little
45:47 - longer but I usually learn a lot in the
45:52 - process so let me my five-minute timer
45:56 - did go off I spent a lot of time on just
45:59 - a few questions sorry I still have a
46:04 - call from when I was sick over the break
46:12 - let's see
46:18 - so I'm trying to figure out where I just
46:20 - left off in the live chat so I can go
46:22 - right back to it after the Mex break
46:32 - 1:28 okay
46:39 - oh yeah all right I'm gonna go off-topic
46:44 - for just a second like I have this bag
46:47 - of Sour neon gummy worms like sitting
46:51 - right next to me I just want to eat him
46:54 - so bad I don't want to be rude and be
46:56 - like chewing right when I'm trying to do
46:58 - this video so it's taking a lot of
47:01 - willpower for me not I'm just gonna
47:03 - throw him in a drawer I can't look at
47:06 - him anymore
47:06 - they had him on sale when I went to the
47:09 - store earlier this week and I just I
47:11 - wanted them out and now they're like I'm
47:14 - addicted to these gummy worms I'm sure
47:18 - my dentist loves that okay all right so
47:28 - let's do one more moment of a session we
47:31 - do at least one more and so what we're
47:40 - gonna do
47:41 - oh I'm gonna leave this like this for
47:46 - now like I said since I'm just gonna
47:48 - show my boss how this looks it doesn't
47:49 - have to be perfect so I'm okay with this
47:53 - looking a little off I would never want
47:55 - to actually launch a site with it
47:56 - looking like that but I think it's fine
48:00 - just just to give them an idea but it's
48:05 - actually this is really throwing me off
48:08 - that things are getting put in place
48:12 - like this let's see
48:28 - and it's just
48:34 - okay
48:37 - maybe it's an option within masonry as
48:40 - to whether things get displayed right to
48:44 - left or left to right off look into that
48:46 - I'm okay with it now but eventually I'm
48:49 - thinking my boss will probably want to
48:51 - be able to have more control over thing
48:53 - where things are so I'll look into the
48:57 - options I know you can do there's a lot
49:02 - of options if you use just the
49:03 - straight-up JavaScript plug-in I'm
49:06 - assuming that at least some of those
49:07 - options can be used with the react
49:09 - component version of masonry so we'll
49:14 - look into that later if we end up going
49:16 - with this all right what did I say I
49:19 - needed oh let's do a card that has just
49:22 - an image and we get rid of this
49:24 - yeah let's actually just get rid of this
49:25 - right now this is hype ah graphy yeah
49:36 - yeah card action it's typography we'll
49:39 - get rid of that I just want to give kind
49:43 - of an assortment of potential options
49:45 - for my boss to look at okay cool so this
49:48 - is just a straight image card
50:06 - I'm gonna copy this and just put a
50:09 - different title in here in different
50:11 - names just maybe like latest posts like
50:15 - latest blog post or something and then
50:18 - what do we do another one maybe it'll
50:21 - say like oh actually let's do one let's
50:27 - do a card it's like a spotlight right
50:29 - spotlight on a faculty member or on a
50:33 - student or maybe on a graduate already
50:37 - we'll throw some of those in there as
50:39 - well so I think for our purposes now we
50:43 - may just be able to modify what we're
50:46 - doing here for a lot of that alright but
50:50 - first let's get this this grid it's so
50:58 - this component is starting to get huge
50:59 - and it's just like it just doesn't feel
51:03 - right but it's gonna have to be like
51:07 - this for now okay okay so we're gonna
51:15 - head this one and let's change events to
51:26 - [Music]
51:30 - latest posts I think that's yeah that'll
51:37 - be what we need oops let me define them
51:52 - into some multiple cursors
52:02 - oh I do not work and
52:12 - there you go
52:18 - all right let's check it out it should
52:20 - work we just done it but just to verify
52:23 - ok cool latest pose pose one two three
52:26 - four we may want to show this with some
52:30 - more text so let's throw that in one
52:39 - thing that we aren't having that I
52:40 - wanted to avoid is we still are having
52:42 - some space which I guess we really we
52:47 - can't avoid that if we're gonna have so
52:51 - many different widths and Heights
52:56 - there's gonna be some space so yeah I
53:03 - just there's not there's not really a
53:06 - way to avoid all the space so we're
53:08 - gonna have to live with that or yeah I
53:13 - mean I just don't see how how I could
53:18 - get around that without really being
53:19 - strict about card Heights oh well it's
53:24 - fine for now it is really is gonna
53:28 - depend on the screen as well so here we
53:31 - you know that it's changed obviously on
53:34 - a small smaller screen we're gonna have
53:37 - right we have none here and for sure
53:40 - we're gonna have none when it's all
53:41 - stacked like this okay
53:49 - let's see if I can add some some more
53:52 - text on here see if this will work for
53:55 - us we have what is this so list item
54:01 - list item text primary so since there's
54:11 - already a primary let's just try
54:13 - secondary and see if that works if this
54:17 - doesn't work I'll look it up in the
54:19 - documentation
54:33 - yeah hey it works why there we go
54:37 - okay so cool we have some secondary
54:40 - texts awesome tool that's good I know my
54:50 - boss will want to see that because he
54:51 - definitely won't want just titles of
54:53 - stuff so so that's good
54:56 - this font size is way too small so we'll
55:02 - probably have to work on the font size
55:04 - at some point but for now this is okay
55:11 - suppose okay let's work on a card that's
55:18 - just going to have let's say like an
55:23 - image and someone's name maybe their
55:28 - title and then some some info about them
55:31 - I just saw coding and caffeine said
55:39 - hello everyone I'm here for the coffee I
55:42 - didn't have any coffee today I really I
55:44 - did have some G fuel I chug some right
55:47 - before the stream so G fuel if you're
55:51 - watching give me a sponsorship
55:54 - anyway but also whoever Kroger made
56:03 - those gummy worms and sold them so I
56:05 - could get a sponsorship from Kroger if
56:07 - anybody's got connections right I've
56:13 - using opinions on my own and they do not
56:15 - reflect those a freak okay
56:22 - all right it's the first thing I want to
56:24 - try to do is just grab this great
56:26 - component and let's copy it and then
56:36 - remove some of these lists let's remove
56:41 - all but one of these list items okay I
56:50 - don't think this is gonna work cuz it'll
56:53 - be too small yeah it's too small but
56:59 - let's see if we can change some of the
57:02 - options here so we're we AG was our list
57:20 - okay this what we had
57:27 - let's check out the API for list item
57:34 - and let's check it out for list item
57:36 - avatar as well and let's see this is
57:43 - interesting list item we have a list
57:47 - item text as well okay so we may have
57:53 - some other options for how to how to
57:56 - create this
58:03 - let's see what we have the avatar is not
58:10 - much
58:22 - seized
58:36 - you
58:41 - okay that doesn't look like anything
58:43 - that helpful for what I wanted to do
58:45 - which I guess I haven't explained I just
58:47 - want this to be bigger so let's uh I'm
58:55 - gonna actually I'm gonna leave this
58:58 - let's make this bigger
59:01 - this is checkout in dev tools first just
59:04 - to see what we may want in terms of size
59:11 - yeah so I was assuming that this was set
59:16 - to 100% which it is for the image so we
59:18 - need to do then is change our width and
59:21 - height for this avatar div so let's go
59:29 - with
59:40 - one hundred one hundred and see what
59:44 - that gives us
59:49 - okay I want it to be bigger for the
59:54 - feature so let's try two hundred and two
60:07 - hundred okay that's not bad just for
60:10 - this and then we'll also want to
60:14 - increase this font size
60:51 - all right we'll just set that for that
60:54 - right now okay
61:10 - so list item avatar we're gonna make a
61:15 - class for this because we're gonna have
61:16 - more than one of these so give it a
61:19 - class name of habits
61:31 - which are
61:36 - Avatara big that's that's pretty
61:40 - straightforward and then this list item
61:44 - text we're gonna give that a class name
61:47 - as well
61:54 - classes let's talk about let's say
62:04 - list.txt big
62:09 - oh yeah one of the hardest parts about
62:12 - doing this live is just coming up with
62:14 - names
62:14 - it's hard enough coming up with names
62:16 - for your stuff but like when you're
62:25 - right on the spot
62:26 - it is hard who's that hey Brian sighs
62:30 - was in here Brian works in the office
62:32 - right next to me he's a developer - you
62:36 - want one of these gummy worms right come
62:39 - in and get one if you own one you want
62:43 - to be on the show just knock on the door
62:44 - I'll open it okay you see how much time
62:54 - I have I do want to okay cool I have
62:57 - enough time to get this done all right
63:00 - so let's go back up here to where we're
63:01 - adding in our CSS so I think we went
63:04 - over this yesterday but if you didn't if
63:06 - you weren't with us yesterday notice
63:09 - this is a normal CSS this is actually a
63:11 - JavaScript object so some of it looks
63:14 - familiar some of it doesn't we are camel
63:17 - casing all of our class names and we're
63:22 - using you normally with CSS or you type
63:25 - it like this and then we have our
63:27 - semicolons but we're using commas now
63:29 - like a JavaScript object okay so this is
63:33 - one of the ways we can do it within a
63:34 - react component we'll use some some
63:37 - different ways as the string continues
63:39 - and in previous streams we've used some
63:42 - different ways but this what we're using
63:44 - right now so what did I say avatar big
63:53 - happen to our big and we wanted to make
63:57 - the width what do we say 200 oops
64:04 - pixels and the height
64:14 - 200 pixels whoops
64:17 - type 102 and now let's do the item list
64:24 - item text big and then we're gonna say
64:35 - font size font size we got a 34
64:46 - yeah 34 pixels there we go okay let's
65:01 - see if this works
65:10 - it should only apply to that last one
65:13 - yep
65:14 - all right cool awesome all right so
65:22 - let's say you know what I'm gonna put
65:29 - this one end because this is probably
65:38 - not going to make it on the actual site
65:41 - so I'm just gonna put this one in for
65:44 - fun
65:55 - and let me grab we got a picture
66:35 - alright let's see this works
66:43 - and primate X
66:52 - so this
67:24 - yes all right cool this is my boss
67:33 - Michael just said this will make it on
67:35 - this final site so I'll do it for fun
67:37 - equals famous last words one time I made
67:43 - a whole site and everything was really
67:46 - sarcastic like the images were all funny
67:51 - and the captions and all the images were
67:53 - all sarcastic and all the text was and
67:55 - some of it actually I had to change it
67:58 - so it wasn't so sarcastic but some of it
67:59 - did make it on the final site but it was
68:02 - just really fun to show everybody who
68:04 - was testing the site maybe this will be
68:12 - an easter egg on the site somewhere I
68:15 - gotta put some sort of Easter Egg in it
68:18 - like if you open dev tools like there'll
68:20 - be something in the console and you know
68:23 - something that most people won't see
68:25 - okay let's see what I owe him on time
68:29 - but anyway I actually I was thinking
68:32 - that this list wouldn't work but it
68:36 - really wasn't hard to adjust so this is
68:40 - not bad so we would have features we're
68:42 - not gonna feature staff member all the
68:45 - staff members are like in the background
68:48 - right the student and the faculty or the
68:51 - stars of the show but we would probably
68:56 - have a faculty member that we would
68:58 - feature and a student and probably a
69:01 - graduate as well and those would
69:05 - probably change so that there would
69:07 - either be arrows so that you could flip
69:09 - through them or every time you loaded
69:11 - the page it would change and we'd have
69:14 - it some something set up so that maybe
69:16 - like every day it changed you know sorry
69:21 - somehow we'd be able to show show more
69:24 - of them Michael said he does have a good
69:27 - beard yet yeah his beer is actually
69:30 - shorter than normal in this picture I
69:32 - think this is an older picture I tried
69:37 - to find a better
69:38 - but is this like the only one that came
69:39 - up on a Google search there's a lot of
69:41 - people named Thomas crow so I didn't
69:46 - realize food I mean I scrolled down for
69:50 - like three seconds and I didn't see any
69:52 - other pictures anyway all right so let's
70:04 - see let's add in ladies pose pose let's
70:13 - add in one more of this style and we'll
70:15 - call it news and let's add in two or
70:17 - three more of these style things and
70:21 - then we'll see how it plays out maybe
70:23 - we'll put in like another video on
70:25 - another image one another one of these
70:28 - to be honest with you that's really kind
70:31 - of boring let's see I am on time because
70:34 - we're not doing anything new we're just
70:35 - gonna lay out some some things so I
70:39 - guess I could just copy and paste a few
70:41 - just so we can get an idea I don't know
70:44 - that it's worth it to do it all on the
70:45 - stream though oh you're gonna grab the
70:57 - image one and if I want to know a list
71:05 - let's grab another list see this will be
71:08 - so nice when these are all separated out
71:10 - into their own components it'll make it
71:11 - so much shorter this is starting to get
71:14 - a little out of hand list and let's grab
71:19 - the
71:24 - the video and the image one
71:34 - see I can't even find what I want
71:36 - anymore all right here's a video on
71:44 - just throw one of these in here and just
71:56 - one more I'll find an image and I'll
71:58 - throw it in there area but you can see
72:09 - hopefully like even if you're not that
72:12 - familiar to react you can start to see
72:14 - already which pieces of this page would
72:17 - be good to separate out into their own
72:20 - components and make them more reusable
72:22 - like imagine if we could condense all
72:25 - this down into just one line that's
72:28 - easily readable you know and it would
72:30 - say image image card or something like
72:34 - that and we just be able to pass in a
72:38 - few a few props a few things that we
72:42 - would wanted to have and it would it
72:45 - would shorten this up significantly
72:57 - all right so I'm gonna say that and
72:59 - let's just whoa what did I do okay
73:08 - whoops looks like I grabbed the end of a
73:14 - masonry tag did I wait a second yeah I
73:24 - added the masonry say in the wrong place
73:31 - there we go
73:38 - and I'm assuming then I have another tag
73:43 - in the wrong place somewhere as well
73:49 - this is that where it needs to go whoops
73:52 - so let's see where the other air is the
73:56 - div seat okay oh hey cool did it work
74:03 - yeah it works oh we forgot to actually
74:07 - add a height in it for this
74:18 - mm not perfect but we can see what would
74:23 - what I need to make sure of is maybe
74:27 - giving more thought to like what we have
74:30 - lined up next to each other so you know
74:33 - making sure that we we always are
74:37 - equaling a hundred percent with with all
74:42 - them you know each section we equal 100%
74:45 - so that we don't have you know a lot of
74:49 - gaps here but otherwise this should give
74:57 - my boss I know this does to me this
75:00 - looks terrible right now all right but
75:03 - this should just give my boss something
75:06 - to look at so that in his mind he can
75:08 - say all cool like we could definitely
75:10 - use that or put that there you know it
75:12 - it really helps I mean you all probably
75:15 - have the same experience but sometimes
75:19 - it really helps to be able to see
75:22 - something with some content in there to
75:26 - really convey like what you're thinking
75:28 - you know I could sketch something on a
75:30 - piece of paper or just explain something
75:32 - but it doesn't click with other people
75:35 - you know you just don't get it until
75:37 - they can see it like this so that's why
75:40 - I do things like this and I think it's
75:45 - really helpful at first just spend a
75:47 - little bit of time build this out even
75:48 - if we know that most of it might not
75:50 - make it into the final site you end up
75:53 - saving a lot of time in the long run if
75:54 - you don't do something like this either
75:57 - building it out as a site or using not
76:00 - only like sketch or Photoshop or
76:02 - something then you could end up doing a
76:06 - lot of work and then finding out way too
76:09 - late that the client or your boss or
76:13 - whoever wants it different right so
76:16 - better to waste a little bit of work at
76:18 - the beginning than to have to redo
76:21 - everything at the end all right so my
76:24 - timer did go off so I'm gonna go back
76:28 - and try to answer as much as I can
76:31 - and let's see what time it is oh yeah
76:33 - definitely I'm gonna answer all the
76:36 - questions it doesn't matter how long it
76:37 - takes
76:38 - and let's 28th okay let me scroll up
76:52 - okay a hearse that says will you be
76:54 - making a pull request using materialized
76:56 - Oh
76:58 - Hardison says we'll be making a portable
77:00 - crushed use materialized if I get time
77:01 - I'm busy right now it is
77:03 - alright cool hard totally
77:06 - understand if you're busy you've been a
77:08 - great help and I really appreciate all
77:11 - the work you do so do not feel obligated
77:14 - at all to do anything if you have time
77:17 - and you want to do it that's awesome you
77:19 - know otherwise I could I could try to do
77:23 - it at some point or someone else could
77:24 - take a shot at it if anybody wants to
77:26 - check out what harsh it did with masonry
77:29 - and materialized in the bulletin project
77:35 - and then try to apply that to this
77:39 - project but anyway you know I always
77:42 - appreciate your work on this but if
77:46 - you're busy you know get done which you
77:49 - need to get done for school or for you
77:51 - know whatever else you're working on
78:04 - okay
78:10 - okay John Hanson says iframe is a bit
78:13 - tricky I found in react as it's
78:15 - difficult for me to figure out if
78:17 - mounted or any onload listener as it
78:21 - would make sense to have an Network
78:24 - offline or error image placeholder okay
78:28 - yeah I've never I haven't worked that
78:31 - much with iframes in react either I
78:37 - guess we will know how it will work more
78:41 - with them and I actually need to change
78:43 - I don't know if who remembers working on
78:49 - project 1 that catechetical Institute
78:50 - site but on the home page there's this
78:52 - really large video and we were using JW
78:58 - player to embed that but it's not
79:01 - working after I upgraded all the
79:02 - packages we got so recently we tried to
79:07 - to upgrade everything to the latest
79:10 - version and everything worked out fine
79:13 - seemingly except the video so I had no
79:18 - luck working on it for way longer than I
79:21 - should have and I think we're just gonna
79:23 - switch it up and use YouTube which is
79:26 - what I want to do originally months ago
79:28 - but anyway we're gonna use YouTube now I
79:30 - think and so I'll be dealing with
79:34 - YouTube embeds and react on that project
79:38 - as well
79:47 - Josh Modine says hello hey hey Josh
79:50 - how's it going thanks for joining us
80:11 - haha world said in your motivation video
80:16 - you start with it's a little after New
80:19 - Year its July I know it's tough i yeah
80:27 - if you haven't seen the video about
80:30 - getting motivated it's on my channel
80:33 - check it out if you like it's only like
80:35 - three minutes but I did mess up right
80:37 - off the beginning I I said that it was
80:39 - July it's obviously not July recorded
80:42 - the video yesterday it's January
80:45 - I corrected myself right after yeah I
80:52 - can't believe I said July
81:02 - okay
81:05 - Oh Michaels says by the way Jessie
81:08 - thanks for the words yesterday when I
81:09 - was at the hospital oh yeah no problem I
81:14 - hope everything's all right
81:16 - - so I understand if you want to talk
81:19 - about it on the live stream or anything
81:21 - like that but I just want to let you
81:22 - know that everything's cool and you know
81:28 - whatever whatever's going on is is
81:31 - getting handled properly with the
81:33 - doctors and everything
81:47 - Harshit was getting a ton of questions
81:49 - about his sleeping routine so these for
81:54 - his timezone these streams are on you
81:56 - know very late
81:58 - he's clarified for everyone for the
82:00 - record he sleeps about six hours so from
82:07 - 2 to 8 so it's 2 a.m. to 8 a.m. and 1:00
82:15 - to 2:30 during the day so it's an
82:17 - adequate amount of sleep yeah that's
82:20 - like you know what is that 7 and a half
82:21 - hours yeah almost 8 hours I went through
82:27 - periods when I was a teenager where I
82:29 - like would not sleep very much at all
82:32 - and just stay up and hang out with my
82:36 - friends which is way less productive
82:38 - than coding hard is actually doing
82:43 - some cool stuff with coding yeah so I
82:47 - understand then I went through periods
82:49 - where I slept all the time
83:02 - michael says that iframe above your head
83:05 - is kind of freaky
83:12 - are you talking about this iframe or is
83:17 - this a joke about the video I don't know
83:27 - Harshit says Jessie this will all be
83:29 - fixed if you materialize as it uses
83:32 - flexbox with well-defined
83:34 - widths okay Vinnie Vinnie axis fixing
83:44 - image with was such a problem yesterday
83:46 - yeah I know was it was such a problem
83:50 - and it was so easy to fix
84:08 - John Henson says LOL neon worms just
84:11 - don't eat too many though you'll find
84:14 - you won't need to turn the light on in
84:17 - the bathroom we needed to go yeah I did
84:20 - the neon the the gummy worm things here
84:23 - definitely are probably not that healthy
84:25 - let's see if I eat nine of these worms
84:30 - it's 140 calories and 24 grams of sugar
84:37 - but it has 2 grams of protein so that's
84:41 - definitely gonna help me in the gym
84:42 - right so I if I ate this whole bag that
84:49 - would be 10 grams of protein I mean you
84:55 - can't beat that right I should
84:57 - definitely one of these before I work
84:58 - out every day I'm not a doctor and
85:03 - nutritionist so don't take any of my
85:05 - advice
85:15 - okay he says actually
85:22 - spar wheel says what is the average time
85:29 - you have to complete a website for a
85:31 - client I don't know it really varies a
85:35 - lot the last time I did a website for a
85:39 - client it was like a year or something
85:41 - crazy it was can usually what happened
85:45 - this is what happened with a client
85:47 - normally at first they want a website
85:49 - like as soon as possible right
85:52 - they're like you can stay up for three
85:54 - days straight and give me this website
85:55 - but then what happens you say okay fine
85:58 - I can do the website I can do it by this
86:00 - day but I need this content and then
86:02 - when it's on them to produce content
86:05 - give to you then it keeps pushing back
86:08 - the date right so it always just takes a
86:13 - long time it seems like when I get
86:14 - clients because of that so I made sure I
86:17 - put my contract that all the dates that
86:19 - I have where I'm gonna complete things
86:21 - by a certain date are all dependent on
86:25 - when I get the material so if they're
86:28 - late by a day my deadline gets pushed
86:30 - back a day right so I'm not on one of my
86:33 - previous projects things got pushed back
86:36 - like I think the site was gonna be
86:39 - completing like two months and end up
86:40 - taking almost a year because I didn't
86:43 - have the the materials and during that
86:46 - period that was when my wife had a baby
86:51 - and had a ton of problems and had to
86:53 - have surgeries and things so the client
86:56 - also like basically let me put the
86:58 - project on hold during that time period
87:00 - so I can take care of her and the kids
87:02 - which was really awesome and very nice
87:04 - of them but then also a lot of it the
87:06 - time was because we're still waiting on
87:08 - on content and things so I don't even
87:13 - know that I could give an average at
87:14 - this point it's just totally it just
87:18 - really really depends on whether or not
87:20 - the material is ready for the client I
87:24 - mean in terms of what I could do and
87:26 - that I mean it would have to be a large
87:29 - site for me not to be able to do it
87:31 - and you know like two months assuming I
87:33 - could really dedicate hours every day to
87:35 - it
87:37 - I mean I'm talking like normal stuff you
87:41 - need for small businesses and stuff
87:42 - right
87:43 - it should never take longer than that
87:45 - for me to do it if they wanted something
87:47 - like it's a really special maybe longer
87:53 - I don't know I would I don't know if I
87:59 - per for a longer a shorter time if it's
88:01 - shorter than its kind of cool because
88:03 - you get to work on new things but then
88:04 - you have to worry about billing and
88:06 - contracts more often but if you get like
88:09 - a big client where you're working on it
88:10 - for months you only have to deal with
88:11 - the contract stuff once and the billing
88:14 - well maybe once I would usually make
88:17 - them pay some upfront and maybe some
88:19 - like in the middle of project two but
88:22 - and then you have guaranteed income
88:25 - anyway that was a really long answer for
88:28 - a simple question and I didn't answer
88:29 - the question so I'm sorry about that but
88:32 - maybe it gave a little insight in into
88:34 - what things are like at least for me
88:36 - when I do freelance work okay what sighs
88:43 - okay John Hanson saying that you you can
88:46 - change the direction so where I was
88:48 - saying I wanted it to go left to right
88:50 - and set it right to left so so we
88:53 - definitely can't change that so I'll be
88:55 - working on that maybe today or all
88:59 - today's I was gonna say tomorrow with
89:01 - tomorrow Saturday so it won't work on a
89:02 - Saturday
89:09 - Michael Creole says it might be only one
89:12 - who seeing the iframe clipped vertically
89:15 - yeah yeah that it's it is cliff
89:24 - okay hard said he had to go at some
89:27 - point but then he came back alright
89:30 - can you set a grid the the fill in the
89:35 - cards yeah maybe there's something that
89:39 - I could do remember I didn't want a
89:42 - bunch of whitespace in the cards though
89:43 - I just have to think see like what would
89:47 - look better to have some white space in
89:49 - the card or to have this gap here it may
89:53 - honestly look better to have white space
89:55 - in a card I mean I think we've done
89:56 - everything we can to eliminate most of
89:59 - that but even so when we have gaps like
90:02 - this I can't just fill that in with this
90:06 - card the image would be all distorted so
90:08 - I have to think more about that
90:26 - Aleksey s are you using material UI yes
90:30 - I am using material UI I've added in a
90:36 - JavaScript plug-in called masonry and
90:40 - I've used the react masonry component
90:44 - package to bring that in so that's
90:45 - what's kind of doing all this layout
90:47 - with these cards but it is using
90:51 - material UI as well on a site
91:02 - t's AG says is asked is it a good idea
91:05 - to restart from challenge one if it's
91:07 - been a while since I've coded yeah it's
91:11 - not bad if it's been a long time and you
91:13 - really don't remember a lot then you
91:15 - could start with challenge one again
91:16 - you'd probably like go really fast
91:19 - through some of them I would check that
91:22 - if you find yourself going to challenge
91:23 - one and like remembering everything then
91:25 - maybe skip ahead so start with one see
91:30 - how it goes if you don't remember a lot
91:34 - of it then just keep going
91:36 - if you do remember a lot then skip skip
91:39 - ahead that's what I usually do if I like
91:43 - quit a tutorial in the middle and then
91:45 - don't come back to it for a while I
91:46 - usually start over
91:58 - tea Zach says does anyone have a few
92:00 - pages of code for a website home page or
92:03 - something similar I could look at for
92:05 - reference tea Zach check out my github
92:10 - profile and also the fu s Markham
92:16 - organization on github we do have some
92:21 - well we have a lot of different websites
92:23 - so you can check out the home page or
92:25 - the index either the index J or the
92:27 - index dot HTML pages is the home page
92:30 - almost always so you can check that code
92:34 - out and most of those projects are live
92:38 - as well so you could see the site and
92:41 - you can see the code behind it
92:53 - Alexander says I like to know what the
92:56 - images from Austria are about the hills
92:59 - look alive okay cool yeah the images
93:02 - from Austria let's zoom in on this so I
93:07 - wish I had a higher resolution right now
93:09 - but I guess this'll work the images from
93:12 - Austria are of our campus and Austria so
93:15 - we have two campuses for this University
93:18 - one here in the United States in
93:21 - Steubenville Ohio this is the main
93:23 - campus it's where the school was was
93:25 - founded then we also have a campus in
93:27 - Austria and students can go over for is
93:31 - either a semester or a year I can't
93:34 - remember which and live and study in
93:37 - Austria and the program set up in such a
93:39 - way that basically every weekend you
93:42 - have enough time to go and travel to
93:44 - different places in Europe so it's it's
93:46 - in a small town called gamma in Austria
93:51 - and it's in an old monastery I think
93:55 - they called the cart ousa
93:56 - and okay so it needs to submit my wife's
94:01 - in the live chat and she corrected me
94:02 - and said it is a semester so hay bag
94:07 - yeah so I've never been over there I
94:10 - really wanted to go over there but
94:12 - there's really no need for a web
94:13 - developer to go to the Austria campus I
94:16 - don't think they'll send me over there
94:18 - any time soon but the students get to
94:21 - see a lot of awesome things over in
94:23 - Europe so it's a good time and in our
94:29 - professors go over there
94:31 - so the professors that teach here on
94:33 - this campus will take you know some time
94:35 - go over there and teach and then come
94:38 - back so and you can see the sceneries
94:42 - beautiful right I mean I don't know it
94:46 - looks cool I've never been over to
94:48 - Europe I've never even been out of my
94:50 - own country so that just kind of
94:53 - fascinates me but that's kind of a cool
94:56 - program a lot of students are interested
94:59 - in it so we kind of like to feature
95:01 - pictures of this because it's just so
95:03 - beautiful over there
95:04 - it's kind of a big selling point for
95:06 - students who want to come to school here
95:08 - because not only when they come to
95:09 - school here and get an education but
95:11 - they also get a chance to go over to
95:13 - Europe and travel at the same time so
95:17 - prospective students really like that
95:28 - okay so Alexander is actually from
95:31 - Austria okay cool
95:32 - oh yeah well like I said I haven't been
95:35 - over there but from what I've seen of
95:39 - what the students do over there it's a
95:41 - very beautiful country so I'd love to
95:43 - visit sometime alright let's see
95:57 - Harshad says any good admin dashboard
96:01 - themes that can pair up well with
96:03 - material UI and next similar to admin
96:05 - LTE I could I really thought that I saw
96:13 - something but this was probably like a
96:15 - year or so ago so I don't remember what
96:19 - what it was but I'm pretty sure there
96:22 - are some material design style admin
96:26 - dashboard themes out there so I'm really
96:31 - sorry I just I have no idea where I saw
96:32 - it but a pretty sure they exist michael
96:42 - creo says real worms have more protein
96:44 - but I wouldn't eat them either yeah
96:48 - actually I don't know if I otherwise
96:52 - would say this on youtube for everybody
96:53 - but I did actually eat a real worm once
96:56 - it was I was really I think I was maybe
97:00 - an early teenager so maybe like 13 or
97:03 - something and one of my older cousins
97:06 - told me to do it kind of like dared me
97:09 - to do it and I did it so it wasn't that
97:12 - tasty though so I haven't done it since
97:18 - the the neon gummy worms are way better
97:27 - our should said should I do free code
97:29 - camp I literally never open the site
97:31 - hard
97:32 - I mean I think it's cool to do the
97:35 - exercises sometime I just do a free code
97:37 - camp like algorithm challenge in the
97:39 - morning just to get my brain working but
97:42 - I kind of think you're you're probably
97:45 - advanced enough that you could just fly
97:47 - through the backend section of it I know
97:49 - your back-end person there may be some
97:51 - stuff in the front-end that may be
97:54 - helpful to you since you don't have as
97:57 - much experience with front-end but the
97:59 - first part of it is is pretty I mean
98:02 - it's for absolute beginners so I think
98:06 - the first percent part of it would be
98:08 - really easy for you but there definitely
98:11 - is some cool stuff in there so you may
98:15 - want to check it out and maybe just skip
98:16 - ahead to some of the harder stuff
98:28 - Oh tease I asked what my github account
98:32 - name was let me see
98:36 - github you think I would know already
98:42 - what my own github thing was I'll just
98:45 - I'll paste the link in oh okay it's
98:47 - Jesse or waggle I kind of thought it
98:50 - with that okay so there's mine and then
98:56 - the other one that has I think all
99:00 - everything that we were going on this
99:01 - channel is this one there we go
99:12 - Michael Chris's your wife is keeping
99:15 - track of you on here my life is actually
99:17 - learning to code so she's doing free
99:19 - code camp and Flatiron school and she's
99:24 - involved with moms can code so she's
99:28 - learning all kind of coding stuff so
99:30 - that's probably why she's watching me
99:31 - and sometimes she has the kids watch me
99:34 - and they like yell at me thinking that I
99:38 - could hear them on youtubes anyway it's
99:47 - cool it that she watches she's probably
99:49 - starting to get good enough that she can
99:50 - understand what we're doing she's
99:53 - actually ahead of me she has more points
99:55 - than me on free code camp now
100:07 - okay John I had some more advice about
100:09 - how to handle the the Rose here
100:14 - okay so said I might have to put an item
100:17 - flex column in a flex row inside a flex
100:20 - row flex container alright if I had all
100:26 - that in then I may definitely switch
100:29 - over to materialise if that will fix the
100:31 - problem because that will be a lot a lot
100:36 - to add into the mark-up our harshad says
100:45 - most of the free templates out there a
100:46 - bootstrap and jquery heavy yeah for sure
100:52 - harsh ed was asking earlier about a an
100:55 - admin panel kind of template or theme
100:58 - that would would match up with material
101:00 - UI yeah that's true you definitely don't
101:05 - want to go with one of those if you
101:06 - don't react yeah I don't know there's
101:10 - got to be something out there with with
101:16 - react that's that's going to be at least
101:18 - some sort of boilerplate to help you get
101:20 - started I wish I knew something offhand
101:23 - I could tell you about but if I come
101:27 - across something soon maybe I'll mention
101:29 - it in an upcoming live chat then Michael
101:34 - crow says there's there's no way that
101:37 - that's you in that picture T Zac said
101:40 - the Lynx didn't work that I just paste
101:41 - it in you know for some reason the links
101:43 - aren't working right when I first paste
101:45 - them in you could probably just copy and
101:48 - paste in their browser and it might work
101:50 - like that
101:52 - but it's something about the YouTube
101:54 - redirects that is messing these up when
101:57 - I paste them in the live chat so anyway
102:00 - so that those URLs will work but the
102:03 - link itself may not work if you click on
102:05 - it in the live chat
102:13 - what was Michael saying there's no way
102:19 - that's me in the picture this is me yeah
102:25 - that's me so my man Brian Sizemore took
102:29 - that picture of me right outside my
102:30 - building obviously it was not recently
102:33 - because there's no snow everywhere but
102:37 - that was like two and a half years ago
102:40 - that's me Johnny Anson said not a little
102:48 - markup once you go smaller components
102:50 - out of this large per minute yeah you're
102:52 - right if I just put it in separate
102:53 - components it won't look that big you
102:56 - just spread it out it'll look smaller
102:58 - right it's all right I'll have to think
103:02 - about it okay all right cool I've gotten
103:05 - to the end of the live chat so I think
103:10 - I'm gonna wrap things up now and eat
103:11 - some more gummy worms I'm going to check
103:15 - the kitchen and see if there's coffee
103:16 - coffee and gummy worms that's a good
103:19 - combo right our hard says why do
103:23 - that extra work I know her is hard
103:26 -  you I I'm probably gonna end up
103:28 - going with materialise so don't I would
103:31 - you worry about it you've made a very
103:33 - good case for using materialize and I
103:36 - kind of wanted to do it anyway but like
103:41 - I said a part of me really wanted to
103:42 - just see like how hard would it be to
103:45 - make this work so we figure it out we've
103:47 - got it working to a point so maybe we'll
103:52 - switch over you already did the work to
103:54 - figure out how the hell that would work
103:55 - and react so really I just need to copy
103:58 - what you had done in the bulletin
103:59 - project but so that that's likely going
104:03 - to happen all right anyway thank you so
104:09 - much for for watching and for all the
104:13 - help and the live chat and had a lot of
104:15 - good questions and a lot of good answers
104:18 - from you all as well and if you haven't
104:23 - already check out my
104:24 - and watch the video that I posted and I
104:28 - don't have ads or anything I don't get
104:29 - any money for that but it may help some
104:32 - of you out if you ever need help with
104:33 - getting some motivation oh okay
104:38 - Brook said remember to do a git push all
104:41 - right
104:42 - let's tease exes I can't log into github
104:47 - because I have a new phone number and
104:48 - they're sending verification numbers to
104:49 - my old phone can you help me um you may
104:52 - want to contact github support I'm not
104:55 - sure yeah I'm not sure if if you can
105:03 - change that without being able to log in
105:06 - yeah so I'll contact the support I mean
105:08 - you should be able to see my repos
105:11 - without having to log in that's that's
105:13 - not a problem but if you actually want
105:16 - to start like you know forking them to
105:19 - your own your own account you will need
105:23 - to be able to log in but yeah your
105:25 - fastest way or your surest way to fix
105:28 - that resolve that is I think just
105:30 - contacting github support all right all
105:39 - right let me get push right now so I
105:41 - don't forget like I normally do get
105:44 - status and we're gonna say
106:00 - they got it recently there I'm just
106:02 - gonna move it at that I know we added a
106:04 - bunch more cards but I really didn't do
106:06 - that much that was new we just kind of
106:07 - duplicated what was already there
106:09 - the only kind of new thing we did was
106:10 - had that gutter we didn't fix the image
106:14 - thing but I'll leave it off for now
106:18 - No hey she won she must be skates what
106:25 - am I not escaping
106:41 - there we go I was that I knew that that
106:44 - was hiding in there someone and I forgot
106:46 - about it all right that was that little
106:52 - end of that masonry component they got
106:55 - left in there all right looks good going
107:06 - through our tests
107:13 - nice okay there we go all the latest is
107:19 - now on github okay great all right so
107:26 - I'm going to go for real this time
107:27 - thanks again for watching and have a
107:31 - great weekend I will be back on Monday
107:40 - all right so see y'all then

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to livestreaming with Jessie today we're gonna continue on with what we've been doing the last two streams and that's working on this homepage yesterday we we got some cards put in like a masonry layout but we were having some trouble getting some of the cards to take up the full width of the columns that we wanted them to be in so I actually found a fix for that that was really simple and I don't know I'm gonna lie didn't think of it yesterday or you know maybe one of you thought of it were trying to tell me in the chat and I just was not getting it but I'm gonna show you what that fixes and then we're gonna get started and and finished this page and it was so simple I just I'm almost embarrassed now how simple it was but let me get started oh there's a lot in the live chat already okay there were some questions about whether or not beginners can watch this stream I would say beginners will probably get something out of this stream they may not understand everything some streams are more beginner friendly than others this stream maybe it's like middle of the road the the whole point of me doing these videos when I first thought thought up you know the idea of doing these was just to see what it's like for me to do my job as a frontend developer and especially to help those people who are beginners or maybe people who are freelance and always work alone I know I I still don't know what it's like for developers you know who like work on a team at a big company you know what their dayin dayout job is like so I thought I'd be cool people to see that but not just seeing me but specifically see me mess up and how I work that and I thought maybe it would give beginners more confidence that you know seeing somebody who's getting paid to do this mess up so much maybe they would think hey like I'm way better than this guy I definitely can get it tough so anyway because of that I think beginners could get something from any of these shows but if you're looking for a tutorial this is not the right stream there are a lot of other great tutorials on the free code camp Channel and on other channels on YouTube but you sometimes it's somewhat like a tutorial but I I there's no way I could in good conscience call this a tutorial we just we mess up way too much and it's not really that structured so anyway if you are a beginner and you're watching feel free to stick around love to have you here and feel free to ask questions I don't answer questions right away I split it up into Pomodoro sessions or 25minute periods of coding and then I'd do five minutes of questionandanswer and then at the very end if there's any questions left over I get to all those questions so just be patient if you ask a question occasionally someone will ask a question and they'll keep asking it over and over and wondering if I'm going to answer their question well I don't even see it because I'm doing the coding so just be patient I'll get to it let's see Michael McCrea says it's usually tutorial for you Jesse that's it that's right these videos are a tutorial for me because you all helped me out so much I learned how I should say truth yeah Irish it has contributed significantly to my learning into my project so yeah glad you're here today are you sure I miss you yesterday I was trying to do it a little bit earlier so you wouldn't have to stay up so late okay all right one more thing before we start I made a video and I I posted it on my youtube channel so there's a link to that I think in the description to this video so this is the free code camp channel I do most of my live streams here but if I come out with videos on other topics or a tutorial I put that on my own personal channel so check that out if you want the video is on getting motivated after the holidays so it's just I I think I mentioned this yesterday to you all but just a really short it's like three minutes of how I got through my sluggishness after the holidays and getting back into it so maybe it'll help somebody else out if you're trying to get back in the you know in decoding after taking a little break okay let's see someone asks about languages frameworks we're using mostly JavaScript and react how Michael said up there there's no bird in the background here my I had I actually went and consulted I did some consulting work and so I just came in from outside and there's snow everywhere so the snow is melting on the bottom of my shoes and it's my shoes are squeaking on the floor as I kind of shift it out in my chair so I apologize for the weird sound that's just the squeaking of my shoes all right so that's all let me let me show you are the screen there we go okay so here's what we've got so far so not a whole lot also I forgot to push the changes to the github repo from yesterday so I apologize to anyone who tried to check out the code it wasn't up to date I pushed them this morning so it is up to date now so you can see we have these cart these three cards here were really thin now they're they're taking up the full width like they should we still need to get this gutter sorted out and we'll do that probably the first thing we work on but I want to show you how I did this so all I added to each one of these grid items here not to the Container grid which I think we removed anyway but today these great items that we were putting that we wanted to take up a certain amount of space so full width quarter with things like that we added this grid item fix class and I'll show you what it was really easy grid item fix gives it a width of 100% that's it so if you I don't know if you all remember from yesterday when we checked in dev tools on the classes that were being applied to that that div it was applying a max width based on you know what was supposed to be so if we wanted it to be fourth of the screen it was saying max width 25% but it had no width property so all I did was say okay well let's put with 100% it'll still be limited by that max width property right and that's it worth so it's a simple fix now it's not universe right so if we wanted to use this grid system on other pages we would have to make sure we keep carrying that over so depending on what we want to do with it we may want to come up with a different way to implement this kind of like globally but for right now this works fine for what we're gonna be doing today so ended up being just very simple and yeah sometimes that happens you know sometimes you gotta sleep on it and it's it worked out okay let's see let me start this Pomodoro timer and let's get that this gutter worked out to about you know the way that we want it so I do want to work within material UI here's the docks so if you want to follow on with the documentation it's material UI next comm and actually I'm just gonna paste this in right now so I can just go right to it and you know what let me sorry let me run and rock as well I forgot to do that yesterday I think I have it up here I do nope I think we're running this on for 3,000 yep we are alright so I'm gonna have a link for you all to view this on your machine as well the link doesn't wasn't working huh that's crazy it's the same length okay I don't know why the link isn't working but that that's exactly the that's really weird all right so maybe it is working for some people I mean if you go to the main site and navigate to there hopefully it will now it works okay all right seems like it's working now maybe it's YouTube redirects oh okay all right so here's what I want to check out see if there is some sort of gutter kind of built into the API maybe space space between I haven't components that contain anything five minutes okay this you can only use this on the container component and we got rid of our container component so that may not work all right maybe we'll all right so I don't think we can put the container grid back no that's not the right one yeah we did get rid of it down here I don't think we're gonna be able to put the container back without messing things up so let's try this see if it works let's just throw margin on this element we'll just give it this goes 16 pixels for now so just 16 pixels all around and let's see if this actually works I'm skeptical that this will work well with what we have going on huh Wow not bad okay but one thing it did do is it messed up our our column see so move this over so if we change it to padding maybe maybe it will have better results there we go okay so actually this is a really good kind of beginners lesson with CSS so the reason why it didn't work with margin but it does work with padding is because actually let me open up dev tools it'll be easier to explain this with with this here okay so you can see this this displays an element and I'm I'm actually going to get the card here so it's displaying okay so this is actually what we just did we just added a padding of 16 on to this so what it does here when it calculates the width of this item any padding is actually counted as the item with so when we're saying elsewhere that we only want this this container to take up 50% of this space it's going to include the padding in there when we put it as margin it doesn't include margin in the width as the width of the container so it was saying okay we're gonna have this take up just this component alone plus whatever padding we had which happened to me nothing but we're gonna take all this and make this the full 50% width but then when you add the margin in it ends up being a little bit more so maybe 52 percent with right so then if we add it up all the three elements which should be 25 25 and 50% we ended up instead of getting 100% which we should have we would end up getting something like I don't know 110 percent that's why this other one got pushed down to here because we gone over the percentage right so really you know there's it's not always obvious on when's the right time to use margin and when's the right time to use padding but in this case it's clear padding is giving us what we want here and margin did not there's price of other cases we can think of where you want to use one over the other for sure and there are some cases where you could use one or the other and it won't really make a difference Jony eight says is that still the case in borderbox that's a good point let's let's mess around a little bit with that just you know since we started let's switch this and use okay so it is it's already using border box let's have it use content box this is going to and we'll use content box and then we'll switch the margin we'll switch this to a margin okay so now this is using margin and they're also using content box so let's move this back to border box and see what happens all right so we're getting this and I'm just confirming that this is we're actually getting the behavior we didn't want let's see if it changes with content bugs okay it isn't changing with content bugs and let's see what happens if we keep content box with our padding and let's switch it up okay all right that's where the difference is all right so just to verify before I explain this because I don't explain the wrong wrong thing I'm gonna switch this back to border and there we go okay so let me go back to here so we could see so here's what happens when we use border box which border box is usually the default correct I'm I'm almost positive that normally it's most sites I work on his border box so a border box works normally as I explained before when you switch to content box then what happens is the the actual width of the content is taken as the width right padding then acts like margin did in our first example so now the padding is actually in addition so the full 50% in the case of this code dear the full 50% is taking up just by this part this content and then in addition to that there is padding and that is gonna add you know 52 percent or something right it's gonna be 52 percent somewhere around there so if you're still having trouble you know with something like this make sure you check your box sizing as well I tend to stick with border box for pretty much everything I rarely even think about this it's not it's not an issue normally but thanks for bringing that up Johnny that definitely could have been confusing if someone was working with something that was set to content box instead of border box all right so let me know if you all appreciate some of those that little kind of side side bar there to explain things I'll try to do that more if if you think it's helpful if you'd rather me just get to the point and start coding that that's cool too Wow my network I apologize if the video quality was bad I just glanced at my network and it was terrible it seems like it's back now at normal so let's see I just wanna make sure I did answer that question adequately okay Johnny says thank you for explaining that it's just like you Arjun yeah yes okay cool so let's let's move on then well let's let's make sure this width is actually what we want I I think that was okay oh and we still we need to make sure we we have our items take up the proper space on smaller screens now that's interesting it shifts over this way I would think that it would shift it would go this way from left to right it's good to know for a layout though all right actually Harsha's saying use materialized you're using many selectors on those divs the necessary okay so hardship thinks we should just use the materialized column classes okay so hard prefers using the materialized grid maybe we'll switch to that I'm not gonna switch to it on the stream right now because it's mostly just copy and paste way but that might not be a bad idea to switch to we already talked about yesterday wolf why we might switch to that so I'm still open to that there was just a part of me that really wanted to see if I could get this to work and and we have a a solution so we'll see if the solution continues to work if we run into too many bugs we'll see how that how leg goes okay so we do have extra small/small actually we we already have we already have the right the right columns on here so that it should be full width let's see what's going on there so we may have found our first bug oh there we go now it is working it was just set to extra small so I think yeah let's let's set this a bit differently yeah so let's see for a small screens right now we have small I mean okay for all our smalls where we have it set to three we're gonna change things up a bit and we're gonna go let's let's try first let's try six for small and then medium I assume medium is MD we'll find out in a second if that works for mediums then we'll go with our three with our quarter so that should be a nicer transition on small screens and okay I made sure to see how this how this works okay so here's our large screen it's like normal see what break point is ok so around 930 pixels somewhere on there 9 950 we have our small break point and that's when it goes down to 2 now we go down to 1 okay so it looks like it's still these are still too thin even on our medium size so I think we're gonna have to we're gonna we're gonna have to bump that up another screen size another screen width so let's take our mediums we'll take our mediums and change them to large and I think that'll work okay so now we should get there we go we get to split a lot earlier we get it up there around 1200 pixels and that that's nicer now we don't have content extending out over that card so these are still you know a bit narrow here once you get down to 1200 pixels but you know we'll see what happens with the with the content when we get real content in there then I think we can do more adjustments for now that's only adjust when I really want to do no sense and really you know getting too detailed with this when we're still just kind of experimenting okay is everybody cool was that it was that somewhat straightforward let me know in the live chat I'll check back in a minute and see if anyone needs me to explain that a bit more and see all right cool so let's add a few more cards in I definitely want to add in a card for video and yeah I'm not sure if I want to keep this cards are right with the image and then like text potentially down here but it might not be a bad idea to just have one you know just with an image in it maybe we could try one out with an image and a text overlay that might not be a bad idea okay alright let's try that out so let's grab down here we're only using up on the large you're really using up 25% because we didn't put another card down here so let's grab another card actually let's grab this wow that's too much I don't want to get that all that let's grab this card here and I'm gonna put another one right in here on top of this and let's make this let's take away this large here so this is going to end up being 50% of the screen for most screen sizes and for the card content this is what I want to do I I don't think I saw anything specifically for a video let me see where we have our image so we have card media let's check out the API for the card media and see if we can't add a video if not then we'll just do our thing the only I was worried about is there's padding built in here to this card content I think there's padding built in the card content so we would want our video to go completely like endtoend let's see where's my okay here it is so let's check out our cards API and card frog Wow it seriously it that's all we have we can also just use paper to make kind of our own video component if we want to I was just kind of hoping that they already had something builtin to the cards but it won't be too much extra work if they don't okay so here's our media okay so it's just showing an image our media API yes okay so it looks like we can do something with with video and the shoes for you that's it back right yeah all right so I all right it's not as straightforward as I thought let me check the live chat and see if anybody is reading this kind of differently than me it seems like from from this part it says in that you know a video would be possible to put in here but I don't know it's it's not 100% clear to me let's see ok hard says if you set the component as video and the source to video but this will give you html5 player ok we'll probably want to end up using the YouTube player so maybe it'll be better if ok harsh it says you can't add the iframe yeah ok maybe we'll try it out with a YouTube embed ok cool so let me grab the YouTube embed code I have I have the video that I just did up here so let's grab the code on my other screen it's got the code from here so you don't want to share we want to embed okay all right so let's see how we're gonna do this I should said shameless plug yellow yeah yes it's by the way check out my video um alright which one are we just coffee I should have coffee the one that had card media was I thinking alright Media and we gonna do what was that source see so do we put so I keep flying back and forth hear me do I need to put source iframe here or what I generally like the documentation they have for this but this is a little big for me maybe I'm just not getting it maybe it's more obvious to you all whoa that's not what I wanted to do what else do we need to put in an image a shrinkies a Dom element or a component okay let's do two years working on it okay so I guess within component that's where I would put this is it gonna let me just in suscribe let's see oh okay so hard should say in the source put the URL in the component put the iframe all right Thank You hard so let me let me just paste this in here quickly so I can grab the source and now I will say iframe okay see what we get uhoh I'm not bad it's not great but it's not bad so we need we need that is something right yeah I think it says the props will useful to extend the style applied to components okay alright let's see how this this would look but there's something it's going off the page because I just changed it in dev tools and I didn't give see what if I adjust it see now the masonry has a chance to lay it out properly but yeah cool play right in there all right not bad it still has some weird stuff going on around the edges some space down here that we don't want so I need some work but it's not it's mostly what we want okay all right let's see my timer went off let's do a short break here and let me go to the live chat okay goog GI o or GI so correct me if I'm pronouncing that wrong but gog asks have a question float vs. inlineblock using floats is not too old comparing to the inlineblock same can be achieved with inlineblock as using floats but less code no need of clear fixes thanks yeah so is there are a lot of different ways to position things in CSS so yeah some things are considered older to use than others I'm of the opinion generally that if it works it works right it's fine to use the issue gets in some cases what about performance you know does it cut down on on your speed most sites don't need to worry about it that much you know but some sites you know even shaving milliseconds is is important right so you generally do want to know about what the best ways are to use and some of the newer ways to do things instead of using floats or inline block is to use flexbox we're now the new CSS grid and so it's good to know flexbox and grid for instance you know if you're gonna do anything with react native all the positioning is through flexbox right so it would be a good idea to just you know start learning that and start positioning with that but if you're not good with that kind of stuff yet and you got to do something then you know the older ways will work it's it's okay but as kind of people start using flexbox and grid more and more it's going to be harder to understand what's going on and other projects if you're still kind of using the older stuff off the top of my head I don't really know with the differences in terms of you know speed right but that would be what I would look at when I would if I was really trying to decide okay which one's best which one I need to use if it was going to be a big deal I would check that out also you had mentioned you could use less code with one or the other no need for clear fixes that that is another thing to take into consideration how difficult is it to implement one versus the other can you save lines of code so anyway hopefully that kind of answered your question a bit but I mean if you're using something that out that is considered somewhat older you hear that don't feel too bad about it right I mean you know to build stuff we're all doing things the best way we know how the idea is that we keep learning things but you can't learn all the new stuff all at once right you just keep adding on every project you try to learn some different and use newer stuff right so you may only learn one new thing on the next project but you know eventually you know you'll keep up and you'll keep learning new things let's see Vinnie ak asked how did you MIT how did you fix image with in masonry I just added I'll show you right now I just added to our grid items I just added a width of 100% and then I added some padding one on top of that that was all it took it ended up being so simple let's see Harshit says I consider this doing work to achieve nothing you are a programmer use the shortest and bugfree way possible I'm telling you this with my previous experience in the bulletin project okay so you're talking to honey that you're talking about using the grid system that comes with masonry or I'm sorry Latino UI versus just using the column classes from materialize that's a good point I do remember that that it ended up being a real pain to try to get that to work with that bulletin project so we may end up switching to that then so I'm gonna have to take a look I'll take a look at the bulletin project to see how it was done there I am way more comfortable with the materialized column classes really so it will be easier for me in the long run to just use materialized so but anyway like I said I'm not gonna switch it right now on the stream I think we're still we are still doing some valuable stuff because we've explained like we got to explain all about padding and margins and stuff right and to be honest with you the purpose of what we're doing right now and in heart should I explain this yesterday so you might not have caught it already I'm just trying to get my boss something to look at so it's intended now it's intended that everything's gonna be refactored significantly once we decide on something so everything we're doing right now may end up getting scrapped and we don't use any of it okay so at this point that's why it may not actually be worth it for me to switch to materialise called classes right now because we may not even use this at all hopefully I'm sure this to my boss soon get some feedback and then we'll know at that point that's probably the better time to make the decision but at least we have you know I and and I know you already know cuz you try them both but now you know we have got along the stream a nice comparison of you know you can go back and watch the old stream see how we did it with the column classes for materialized and now we could see how we deal with the grid I don't know you know how I am I always like to try two different ways and see which one works out can't always do that sometimes there's just not enough time but in this case I think it's worthwhile the process of going through it I think is worthwhile it may take a little longer but I usually learn a lot in the process so let me my fiveminute timer did go off I spent a lot of time on just a few questions sorry I still have a call from when I was sick over the break let's see so I'm trying to figure out where I just left off in the live chat so I can go right back to it after the Mex break 128 okay oh yeah all right I'm gonna go offtopic for just a second like I have this bag of Sour neon gummy worms like sitting right next to me I just want to eat him so bad I don't want to be rude and be like chewing right when I'm trying to do this video so it's taking a lot of willpower for me not I'm just gonna throw him in a drawer I can't look at him anymore they had him on sale when I went to the store earlier this week and I just I wanted them out and now they're like I'm addicted to these gummy worms I'm sure my dentist loves that okay all right so let's do one more moment of a session we do at least one more and so what we're gonna do oh I'm gonna leave this like this for now like I said since I'm just gonna show my boss how this looks it doesn't have to be perfect so I'm okay with this looking a little off I would never want to actually launch a site with it looking like that but I think it's fine just just to give them an idea but it's actually this is really throwing me off that things are getting put in place like this let's see and it's just okay maybe it's an option within masonry as to whether things get displayed right to left or left to right off look into that I'm okay with it now but eventually I'm thinking my boss will probably want to be able to have more control over thing where things are so I'll look into the options I know you can do there's a lot of options if you use just the straightup JavaScript plugin I'm assuming that at least some of those options can be used with the react component version of masonry so we'll look into that later if we end up going with this all right what did I say I needed oh let's do a card that has just an image and we get rid of this yeah let's actually just get rid of this right now this is hype ah graphy yeah yeah card action it's typography we'll get rid of that I just want to give kind of an assortment of potential options for my boss to look at okay cool so this is just a straight image card I'm gonna copy this and just put a different title in here in different names just maybe like latest posts like latest blog post or something and then what do we do another one maybe it'll say like oh actually let's do one let's do a card it's like a spotlight right spotlight on a faculty member or on a student or maybe on a graduate already we'll throw some of those in there as well so I think for our purposes now we may just be able to modify what we're doing here for a lot of that alright but first let's get this this grid it's so this component is starting to get huge and it's just like it just doesn't feel right but it's gonna have to be like this for now okay okay so we're gonna head this one and let's change events to latest posts I think that's yeah that'll be what we need oops let me define them into some multiple cursors oh I do not work and there you go all right let's check it out it should work we just done it but just to verify ok cool latest pose pose one two three four we may want to show this with some more text so let's throw that in one thing that we aren't having that I wanted to avoid is we still are having some space which I guess we really we can't avoid that if we're gonna have so many different widths and Heights there's gonna be some space so yeah I just there's not there's not really a way to avoid all the space so we're gonna have to live with that or yeah I mean I just don't see how how I could get around that without really being strict about card Heights oh well it's fine for now it is really is gonna depend on the screen as well so here we you know that it's changed obviously on a small smaller screen we're gonna have right we have none here and for sure we're gonna have none when it's all stacked like this okay let's see if I can add some some more text on here see if this will work for us we have what is this so list item list item text primary so since there's already a primary let's just try secondary and see if that works if this doesn't work I'll look it up in the documentation yeah hey it works why there we go okay so cool we have some secondary texts awesome tool that's good I know my boss will want to see that because he definitely won't want just titles of stuff so so that's good this font size is way too small so we'll probably have to work on the font size at some point but for now this is okay suppose okay let's work on a card that's just going to have let's say like an image and someone's name maybe their title and then some some info about them I just saw coding and caffeine said hello everyone I'm here for the coffee I didn't have any coffee today I really I did have some G fuel I chug some right before the stream so G fuel if you're watching give me a sponsorship anyway but also whoever Kroger made those gummy worms and sold them so I could get a sponsorship from Kroger if anybody's got connections right I've using opinions on my own and they do not reflect those a freak okay all right it's the first thing I want to try to do is just grab this great component and let's copy it and then remove some of these lists let's remove all but one of these list items okay I don't think this is gonna work cuz it'll be too small yeah it's too small but let's see if we can change some of the options here so we're we AG was our list okay this what we had let's check out the API for list item and let's check it out for list item avatar as well and let's see this is interesting list item we have a list item text as well okay so we may have some other options for how to how to create this let's see what we have the avatar is not much seized you okay that doesn't look like anything that helpful for what I wanted to do which I guess I haven't explained I just want this to be bigger so let's uh I'm gonna actually I'm gonna leave this let's make this bigger this is checkout in dev tools first just to see what we may want in terms of size yeah so I was assuming that this was set to 100% which it is for the image so we need to do then is change our width and height for this avatar div so let's go with one hundred one hundred and see what that gives us okay I want it to be bigger for the feature so let's try two hundred and two hundred okay that's not bad just for this and then we'll also want to increase this font size all right we'll just set that for that right now okay so list item avatar we're gonna make a class for this because we're gonna have more than one of these so give it a class name of habits which are Avatara big that's that's pretty straightforward and then this list item text we're gonna give that a class name as well classes let's talk about let's say list.txt big oh yeah one of the hardest parts about doing this live is just coming up with names it's hard enough coming up with names for your stuff but like when you're right on the spot it is hard who's that hey Brian sighs was in here Brian works in the office right next to me he's a developer you want one of these gummy worms right come in and get one if you own one you want to be on the show just knock on the door I'll open it okay you see how much time I have I do want to okay cool I have enough time to get this done all right so let's go back up here to where we're adding in our CSS so I think we went over this yesterday but if you didn't if you weren't with us yesterday notice this is a normal CSS this is actually a JavaScript object so some of it looks familiar some of it doesn't we are camel casing all of our class names and we're using you normally with CSS or you type it like this and then we have our semicolons but we're using commas now like a JavaScript object okay so this is one of the ways we can do it within a react component we'll use some some different ways as the string continues and in previous streams we've used some different ways but this what we're using right now so what did I say avatar big happen to our big and we wanted to make the width what do we say 200 oops pixels and the height 200 pixels whoops type 102 and now let's do the item list item text big and then we're gonna say font size font size we got a 34 yeah 34 pixels there we go okay let's see if this works it should only apply to that last one yep all right cool awesome all right so let's say you know what I'm gonna put this one end because this is probably not going to make it on the actual site so I'm just gonna put this one in for fun and let me grab we got a picture alright let's see this works and primate X so this yes all right cool this is my boss Michael just said this will make it on this final site so I'll do it for fun equals famous last words one time I made a whole site and everything was really sarcastic like the images were all funny and the captions and all the images were all sarcastic and all the text was and some of it actually I had to change it so it wasn't so sarcastic but some of it did make it on the final site but it was just really fun to show everybody who was testing the site maybe this will be an easter egg on the site somewhere I gotta put some sort of Easter Egg in it like if you open dev tools like there'll be something in the console and you know something that most people won't see okay let's see what I owe him on time but anyway I actually I was thinking that this list wouldn't work but it really wasn't hard to adjust so this is not bad so we would have features we're not gonna feature staff member all the staff members are like in the background right the student and the faculty or the stars of the show but we would probably have a faculty member that we would feature and a student and probably a graduate as well and those would probably change so that there would either be arrows so that you could flip through them or every time you loaded the page it would change and we'd have it some something set up so that maybe like every day it changed you know sorry somehow we'd be able to show show more of them Michael said he does have a good beard yet yeah his beer is actually shorter than normal in this picture I think this is an older picture I tried to find a better but is this like the only one that came up on a Google search there's a lot of people named Thomas crow so I didn't realize food I mean I scrolled down for like three seconds and I didn't see any other pictures anyway all right so let's see let's add in ladies pose pose let's add in one more of this style and we'll call it news and let's add in two or three more of these style things and then we'll see how it plays out maybe we'll put in like another video on another image one another one of these to be honest with you that's really kind of boring let's see I am on time because we're not doing anything new we're just gonna lay out some some things so I guess I could just copy and paste a few just so we can get an idea I don't know that it's worth it to do it all on the stream though oh you're gonna grab the image one and if I want to know a list let's grab another list see this will be so nice when these are all separated out into their own components it'll make it so much shorter this is starting to get a little out of hand list and let's grab the the video and the image one see I can't even find what I want anymore all right here's a video on just throw one of these in here and just one more I'll find an image and I'll throw it in there area but you can see hopefully like even if you're not that familiar to react you can start to see already which pieces of this page would be good to separate out into their own components and make them more reusable like imagine if we could condense all this down into just one line that's easily readable you know and it would say image image card or something like that and we just be able to pass in a few a few props a few things that we would wanted to have and it would it would shorten this up significantly all right so I'm gonna say that and let's just whoa what did I do okay whoops looks like I grabbed the end of a masonry tag did I wait a second yeah I added the masonry say in the wrong place there we go and I'm assuming then I have another tag in the wrong place somewhere as well this is that where it needs to go whoops so let's see where the other air is the div seat okay oh hey cool did it work yeah it works oh we forgot to actually add a height in it for this mm not perfect but we can see what would what I need to make sure of is maybe giving more thought to like what we have lined up next to each other so you know making sure that we we always are equaling a hundred percent with with all them you know each section we equal 100% so that we don't have you know a lot of gaps here but otherwise this should give my boss I know this does to me this looks terrible right now all right but this should just give my boss something to look at so that in his mind he can say all cool like we could definitely use that or put that there you know it it really helps I mean you all probably have the same experience but sometimes it really helps to be able to see something with some content in there to really convey like what you're thinking you know I could sketch something on a piece of paper or just explain something but it doesn't click with other people you know you just don't get it until they can see it like this so that's why I do things like this and I think it's really helpful at first just spend a little bit of time build this out even if we know that most of it might not make it into the final site you end up saving a lot of time in the long run if you don't do something like this either building it out as a site or using not only like sketch or Photoshop or something then you could end up doing a lot of work and then finding out way too late that the client or your boss or whoever wants it different right so better to waste a little bit of work at the beginning than to have to redo everything at the end all right so my timer did go off so I'm gonna go back and try to answer as much as I can and let's see what time it is oh yeah definitely I'm gonna answer all the questions it doesn't matter how long it takes and let's 28th okay let me scroll up okay a hearse that says will you be making a pull request using materialized Oh Hardison says we'll be making a portable crushed use materialized if I get time I'm busy right now it is alright cool hard totally understand if you're busy you've been a great help and I really appreciate all the work you do so do not feel obligated at all to do anything if you have time and you want to do it that's awesome you know otherwise I could I could try to do it at some point or someone else could take a shot at it if anybody wants to check out what harsh it did with masonry and materialized in the bulletin project and then try to apply that to this project but anyway you know I always appreciate your work on this but if you're busy you know get done which you need to get done for school or for you know whatever else you're working on okay okay John Hanson says iframe is a bit tricky I found in react as it's difficult for me to figure out if mounted or any onload listener as it would make sense to have an Network offline or error image placeholder okay yeah I've never I haven't worked that much with iframes in react either I guess we will know how it will work more with them and I actually need to change I don't know if who remembers working on project 1 that catechetical Institute site but on the home page there's this really large video and we were using JW player to embed that but it's not working after I upgraded all the packages we got so recently we tried to to upgrade everything to the latest version and everything worked out fine seemingly except the video so I had no luck working on it for way longer than I should have and I think we're just gonna switch it up and use YouTube which is what I want to do originally months ago but anyway we're gonna use YouTube now I think and so I'll be dealing with YouTube embeds and react on that project as well Josh Modine says hello hey hey Josh how's it going thanks for joining us haha world said in your motivation video you start with it's a little after New Year its July I know it's tough i yeah if you haven't seen the video about getting motivated it's on my channel check it out if you like it's only like three minutes but I did mess up right off the beginning I I said that it was July it's obviously not July recorded the video yesterday it's January I corrected myself right after yeah I can't believe I said July okay Oh Michaels says by the way Jessie thanks for the words yesterday when I was at the hospital oh yeah no problem I hope everything's all right so I understand if you want to talk about it on the live stream or anything like that but I just want to let you know that everything's cool and you know whatever whatever's going on is is getting handled properly with the doctors and everything Harshit was getting a ton of questions about his sleeping routine so these for his timezone these streams are on you know very late he's clarified for everyone for the record he sleeps about six hours so from 2 to 8 so it's 2 a.m. to 8 a.m. and 100 to 230 during the day so it's an adequate amount of sleep yeah that's like you know what is that 7 and a half hours yeah almost 8 hours I went through periods when I was a teenager where I like would not sleep very much at all and just stay up and hang out with my friends which is way less productive than coding hard is actually doing some cool stuff with coding yeah so I understand then I went through periods where I slept all the time michael says that iframe above your head is kind of freaky are you talking about this iframe or is this a joke about the video I don't know Harshit says Jessie this will all be fixed if you materialize as it uses flexbox with welldefined widths okay Vinnie Vinnie axis fixing image with was such a problem yesterday yeah I know was it was such a problem and it was so easy to fix John Henson says LOL neon worms just don't eat too many though you'll find you won't need to turn the light on in the bathroom we needed to go yeah I did the neon the the gummy worm things here definitely are probably not that healthy let's see if I eat nine of these worms it's 140 calories and 24 grams of sugar but it has 2 grams of protein so that's definitely gonna help me in the gym right so I if I ate this whole bag that would be 10 grams of protein I mean you can't beat that right I should definitely one of these before I work out every day I'm not a doctor and nutritionist so don't take any of my advice okay he says actually spar wheel says what is the average time you have to complete a website for a client I don't know it really varies a lot the last time I did a website for a client it was like a year or something crazy it was can usually what happened this is what happened with a client normally at first they want a website like as soon as possible right they're like you can stay up for three days straight and give me this website but then what happens you say okay fine I can do the website I can do it by this day but I need this content and then when it's on them to produce content give to you then it keeps pushing back the date right so it always just takes a long time it seems like when I get clients because of that so I made sure I put my contract that all the dates that I have where I'm gonna complete things by a certain date are all dependent on when I get the material so if they're late by a day my deadline gets pushed back a day right so I'm not on one of my previous projects things got pushed back like I think the site was gonna be completing like two months and end up taking almost a year because I didn't have the the materials and during that period that was when my wife had a baby and had a ton of problems and had to have surgeries and things so the client also like basically let me put the project on hold during that time period so I can take care of her and the kids which was really awesome and very nice of them but then also a lot of it the time was because we're still waiting on on content and things so I don't even know that I could give an average at this point it's just totally it just really really depends on whether or not the material is ready for the client I mean in terms of what I could do and that I mean it would have to be a large site for me not to be able to do it and you know like two months assuming I could really dedicate hours every day to it I mean I'm talking like normal stuff you need for small businesses and stuff right it should never take longer than that for me to do it if they wanted something like it's a really special maybe longer I don't know I would I don't know if I per for a longer a shorter time if it's shorter than its kind of cool because you get to work on new things but then you have to worry about billing and contracts more often but if you get like a big client where you're working on it for months you only have to deal with the contract stuff once and the billing well maybe once I would usually make them pay some upfront and maybe some like in the middle of project two but and then you have guaranteed income anyway that was a really long answer for a simple question and I didn't answer the question so I'm sorry about that but maybe it gave a little insight in into what things are like at least for me when I do freelance work okay what sighs okay John Hanson saying that you you can change the direction so where I was saying I wanted it to go left to right and set it right to left so so we definitely can't change that so I'll be working on that maybe today or all today's I was gonna say tomorrow with tomorrow Saturday so it won't work on a Saturday Michael Creole says it might be only one who seeing the iframe clipped vertically yeah yeah that it's it is cliff okay hard said he had to go at some point but then he came back alright can you set a grid the the fill in the cards yeah maybe there's something that I could do remember I didn't want a bunch of whitespace in the cards though I just have to think see like what would look better to have some white space in the card or to have this gap here it may honestly look better to have white space in a card I mean I think we've done everything we can to eliminate most of that but even so when we have gaps like this I can't just fill that in with this card the image would be all distorted so I have to think more about that Aleksey s are you using material UI yes I am using material UI I've added in a JavaScript plugin called masonry and I've used the react masonry component package to bring that in so that's what's kind of doing all this layout with these cards but it is using material UI as well on a site t's AG says is asked is it a good idea to restart from challenge one if it's been a while since I've coded yeah it's not bad if it's been a long time and you really don't remember a lot then you could start with challenge one again you'd probably like go really fast through some of them I would check that if you find yourself going to challenge one and like remembering everything then maybe skip ahead so start with one see how it goes if you don't remember a lot of it then just keep going if you do remember a lot then skip skip ahead that's what I usually do if I like quit a tutorial in the middle and then don't come back to it for a while I usually start over tea Zach says does anyone have a few pages of code for a website home page or something similar I could look at for reference tea Zach check out my github profile and also the fu s Markham organization on github we do have some well we have a lot of different websites so you can check out the home page or the index either the index J or the index dot HTML pages is the home page almost always so you can check that code out and most of those projects are live as well so you could see the site and you can see the code behind it Alexander says I like to know what the images from Austria are about the hills look alive okay cool yeah the images from Austria let's zoom in on this so I wish I had a higher resolution right now but I guess this'll work the images from Austria are of our campus and Austria so we have two campuses for this University one here in the United States in Steubenville Ohio this is the main campus it's where the school was was founded then we also have a campus in Austria and students can go over for is either a semester or a year I can't remember which and live and study in Austria and the program set up in such a way that basically every weekend you have enough time to go and travel to different places in Europe so it's it's in a small town called gamma in Austria and it's in an old monastery I think they called the cart ousa and okay so it needs to submit my wife's in the live chat and she corrected me and said it is a semester so hay bag yeah so I've never been over there I really wanted to go over there but there's really no need for a web developer to go to the Austria campus I don't think they'll send me over there any time soon but the students get to see a lot of awesome things over in Europe so it's a good time and in our professors go over there so the professors that teach here on this campus will take you know some time go over there and teach and then come back so and you can see the sceneries beautiful right I mean I don't know it looks cool I've never been over to Europe I've never even been out of my own country so that just kind of fascinates me but that's kind of a cool program a lot of students are interested in it so we kind of like to feature pictures of this because it's just so beautiful over there it's kind of a big selling point for students who want to come to school here because not only when they come to school here and get an education but they also get a chance to go over to Europe and travel at the same time so prospective students really like that okay so Alexander is actually from Austria okay cool oh yeah well like I said I haven't been over there but from what I've seen of what the students do over there it's a very beautiful country so I'd love to visit sometime alright let's see Harshad says any good admin dashboard themes that can pair up well with material UI and next similar to admin LTE I could I really thought that I saw something but this was probably like a year or so ago so I don't remember what what it was but I'm pretty sure there are some material design style admin dashboard themes out there so I'm really sorry I just I have no idea where I saw it but a pretty sure they exist michael creo says real worms have more protein but I wouldn't eat them either yeah actually I don't know if I otherwise would say this on youtube for everybody but I did actually eat a real worm once it was I was really I think I was maybe an early teenager so maybe like 13 or something and one of my older cousins told me to do it kind of like dared me to do it and I did it so it wasn't that tasty though so I haven't done it since the the neon gummy worms are way better our should said should I do free code camp I literally never open the site hard I mean I think it's cool to do the exercises sometime I just do a free code camp like algorithm challenge in the morning just to get my brain working but I kind of think you're you're probably advanced enough that you could just fly through the backend section of it I know your backend person there may be some stuff in the frontend that may be helpful to you since you don't have as much experience with frontend but the first part of it is is pretty I mean it's for absolute beginners so I think the first percent part of it would be really easy for you but there definitely is some cool stuff in there so you may want to check it out and maybe just skip ahead to some of the harder stuff Oh tease I asked what my github account name was let me see github you think I would know already what my own github thing was I'll just I'll paste the link in oh okay it's Jesse or waggle I kind of thought it with that okay so there's mine and then the other one that has I think all everything that we were going on this channel is this one there we go Michael Chris's your wife is keeping track of you on here my life is actually learning to code so she's doing free code camp and Flatiron school and she's involved with moms can code so she's learning all kind of coding stuff so that's probably why she's watching me and sometimes she has the kids watch me and they like yell at me thinking that I could hear them on youtubes anyway it's cool it that she watches she's probably starting to get good enough that she can understand what we're doing she's actually ahead of me she has more points than me on free code camp now okay John I had some more advice about how to handle the the Rose here okay so said I might have to put an item flex column in a flex row inside a flex row flex container alright if I had all that in then I may definitely switch over to materialise if that will fix the problem because that will be a lot a lot to add into the markup our harshad says most of the free templates out there a bootstrap and jquery heavy yeah for sure harsh ed was asking earlier about a an admin panel kind of template or theme that would would match up with material UI yeah that's true you definitely don't want to go with one of those if you don't react yeah I don't know there's got to be something out there with with react that's that's going to be at least some sort of boilerplate to help you get started I wish I knew something offhand I could tell you about but if I come across something soon maybe I'll mention it in an upcoming live chat then Michael crow says there's there's no way that that's you in that picture T Zac said the Lynx didn't work that I just paste it in you know for some reason the links aren't working right when I first paste them in you could probably just copy and paste in their browser and it might work like that but it's something about the YouTube redirects that is messing these up when I paste them in the live chat so anyway so that those URLs will work but the link itself may not work if you click on it in the live chat what was Michael saying there's no way that's me in the picture this is me yeah that's me so my man Brian Sizemore took that picture of me right outside my building obviously it was not recently because there's no snow everywhere but that was like two and a half years ago that's me Johnny Anson said not a little markup once you go smaller components out of this large per minute yeah you're right if I just put it in separate components it won't look that big you just spread it out it'll look smaller right it's all right I'll have to think about it okay all right cool I've gotten to the end of the live chat so I think I'm gonna wrap things up now and eat some more gummy worms I'm going to check the kitchen and see if there's coffee coffee and gummy worms that's a good combo right our hard says why do that extra work I know her is hard you I I'm probably gonna end up going with materialise so don't I would you worry about it you've made a very good case for using materialize and I kind of wanted to do it anyway but like I said a part of me really wanted to just see like how hard would it be to make this work so we figure it out we've got it working to a point so maybe we'll switch over you already did the work to figure out how the hell that would work and react so really I just need to copy what you had done in the bulletin project but so that that's likely going to happen all right anyway thank you so much for for watching and for all the help and the live chat and had a lot of good questions and a lot of good answers from you all as well and if you haven't already check out my and watch the video that I posted and I don't have ads or anything I don't get any money for that but it may help some of you out if you ever need help with getting some motivation oh okay Brook said remember to do a git push all right let's tease exes I can't log into github because I have a new phone number and they're sending verification numbers to my old phone can you help me um you may want to contact github support I'm not sure yeah I'm not sure if if you can change that without being able to log in yeah so I'll contact the support I mean you should be able to see my repos without having to log in that's that's not a problem but if you actually want to start like you know forking them to your own your own account you will need to be able to log in but yeah your fastest way or your surest way to fix that resolve that is I think just contacting github support all right all right let me get push right now so I don't forget like I normally do get status and we're gonna say they got it recently there I'm just gonna move it at that I know we added a bunch more cards but I really didn't do that much that was new we just kind of duplicated what was already there the only kind of new thing we did was had that gutter we didn't fix the image thing but I'll leave it off for now No hey she won she must be skates what am I not escaping there we go I was that I knew that that was hiding in there someone and I forgot about it all right that was that little end of that masonry component they got left in there all right looks good going through our tests nice okay there we go all the latest is now on github okay great all right so I'm going to go for real this time thanks again for watching and have a great weekend I will be back on Monday all right so see y'all then
