00:05 - everybody welcome to live coding with
00:08 - Jesse today we're gonna keep working on
00:12 - that Salesforce form that's it's got a
00:21 - lot of a different stuff going on so
00:23 - it's in Salesforce but it's built by a
00:26 - company called Target X that was
00:31 - actually customized by a company called
00:34 - Jenzabar and really it was built with a
00:38 - combination of these visualforce apex
00:44 - components and angular so we got a lot
00:49 - going on here but today it's not that
00:51 - complicated because we're basically just
00:52 - doing CSS so we're gonna style this
00:57 - thing with CSS just an update on some of
01:00 - the other projects I have a new issue
01:03 - open in the react bulletin and I know
01:07 - the reactive Resource Center project
01:10 - because the head of my department uses
01:13 - Safari 9.1 on a Mac and the forms don't
01:19 - work so I did a little bit of research
01:22 - on it and some testing and I put some
01:23 - info on that issue so if anybody really
01:26 - likes trying to get older browsers to
01:27 - work with things then have at it
01:29 - otherwise I'm just going to keep working
01:31 - on it this week on our bulletin projects
01:35 - or react bulletin I've merged in two new
01:38 - pool requests so maybe we can go over
01:41 - those a little bit later on during the
01:42 - question and answer session if we have
01:44 - time I do have a meeting at 3:00 p.m. my
01:47 - time eastern time so that gives us an
01:50 - hour and a half till my meeting I would
01:52 - like to finish up in around an hour if
01:56 - possible to give me time to prep for my
01:59 - meeting but the meetings only about 20
02:03 - feet away from where I'm sitting right
02:05 - now so it shouldn't take me that long to
02:07 - get there so if we go over at our 15
02:09 - minutes that's fine too but
02:12 - sebastien and Harsha both submitted
02:14 - amazing pool requests so hopefully we
02:17 - have time to go over those otherwise you
02:19 - can check it out third thing I want to
02:21 - mention before we get started is that
02:24 - October fest is almost over so if you
02:28 - don't know what hack tober fest is let
02:31 - me just put this up briefly so you can
02:35 - check out
02:37 - Oktoberfest digitalocean comm you get a
02:41 - free t-shirt if you sign up and then
02:44 - submit for pool requests before October
02:48 - 31st is over so I think you have today
02:51 - and tomorrow so check that out if you
02:54 - haven't already and if you haven't got
02:55 - your 4 and yet like me then check out
03:00 - some of the repos that we've been
03:01 - working on their stores some issues open
03:03 - and if you find something that I missed
03:05 - that needs work feel free to submit a
03:09 - pull request for that as well what I'd
03:11 - like to ask all of you is to let me know
03:14 - if there's something on one of your
03:16 - projects that you'd like for me to work
03:18 - on if there's something let me know
03:21 - either in the live chat or on Twitter or
03:24 - email or whatever social media you like
03:27 - if you can find my phone number you can
03:28 - call leave a message if you want but I
03:30 - just need to know the URL of your
03:32 - repository and what issue you you want
03:36 - me to fix so I've been looking for some
03:38 - good issues to use as my my fourth and
03:41 - final Oktoberfest pull request but I
03:45 - thought earlier today when I was looking
03:47 - through the list I thought you know what
03:48 - I would really much rather work on an
03:50 - issue that that you all need some help
03:53 - with since you all helped me so much
03:55 - with my projects I thought that would be
03:58 - cool so at least I want to give you all
04:00 - first dibs on my last PR and if I don't
04:05 - hear from any of you then I'll probably
04:07 - work on something tomorrow I will not be
04:11 - streaming tomorrow
04:12 - my wife has some testing that she needs
04:15 - to have done for some some health issues
04:18 - in the morning and so I'll be out all
04:22 - morning and I thought I don't really
04:24 - want to get ready and come into
04:26 - for a few hours in the afternoon if I
04:28 - could just work from home unfortunately
04:31 - as some of you already know my internet
04:32 - is not good enough at home to do a
04:34 - decent quality stream so I'll be off
04:37 - tomorrow so for those of you do be cell
04:39 - awaiting celebrating Halloween happy
04:42 - Halloween and I will be back Wednesday
04:47 - most likely unless something happens all
04:50 - right so enough enough with getting all
04:54 - of that out of the way okay not bad I
04:56 - only spent five minutes with the intro
04:59 - here so I've done worse all right so
05:07 - let's check out our Trello board first
05:11 - just to see what we were working on so
05:14 - for now we want to fix those button
05:18 - colors if you remember last week's
05:22 - stream the last stream on on Friday
05:26 - we're working with some weird things
05:29 - that were overriding our styles for our
05:31 - buttons and we tested out a few ways to
05:34 - make our styles override the the other
05:38 - styles that are in there and couldn't
05:40 - figure it out and I had said that I was
05:43 - going to try to look around and see if I
05:45 - could find something in Salesforce I
05:47 - ended up not having time to because the
05:51 - head of my department called me in to
05:53 - check out her computer because she
05:57 - couldn't submit anything through our
05:58 - Resource Center that we had launched
06:00 - last month at some point so I spent the
06:04 - rest of my day here trying to figure out
06:07 - what was wrong and then researching bugs
06:10 - for Safari 9 point I think it's nine
06:13 - point one so anyway I was not able to do
06:17 - what I wanted to do so I'm thinking for
06:20 - this string we may just have to resort
06:23 - to throwing in some importance and later
06:27 - on if I'm digging around in some files
06:28 - and I figure out where I can remove some
06:32 - of the styles that are currently being
06:34 - injected in there somewhere then we can
06:38 - always remove them
06:39 - later but if you'll notice there's two
06:41 - things we need to change just to in case
06:45 - you you weren't with us last week this
06:47 - blue shot this is actually a shadow
06:49 - underneath so we need our shadow to
06:53 - override that and then I do not want
06:56 - this button to transform like that and
07:00 - get shorter and wider other than that
07:04 - the button is not looking too bad so
07:07 - that's what we're going to work on first
07:08 - and then I think we'll probably switch
07:10 - over here to this side nap and we'll get
07:13 - this styled a little bit differently
07:15 - than it is now it's going to fit the
07:17 - university styles and we'll try to make
07:20 - it match as much as possible some of the
07:23 - the other side drawer side knives that
07:27 - we've been doing for our other sites all
07:31 - right so let's get to it let me move my
07:35 - timer somewhere up here let me put it up
07:40 - here now weights far away's I can get
07:42 - from my my face in the corner I won't
07:44 - cover it up like I normally do so I was
07:47 - doing a Pomodoro session before on
07:49 - another project so I'm just gonna
07:51 - restart that now and let's get over here
07:58 - to find our code
08:01 - I want to rearrange this order here
08:03 - there we go okay great so here's our app
08:07 - template we were putting our CSS in a
08:11 - separate file but I've given up on that
08:12 - it just added an extra step to the flow
08:16 - so I could always at some point just
08:19 - copy this style tag over into this file
08:22 - if I think it's useful so let me see I
08:29 - should have watched the last part of the
08:31 - stream on Friday I didn't have time and
08:33 - think about it to remind me of what we
08:37 - were editing I'm I'm pretty sure it
08:43 - wasn't that it would have been button
08:45 - styles which is down here
08:49 - there we go okay so we're already using
08:53 - important on the color let's try let's
09:02 - see alright let me see what's going on
09:05 - here with this transform first of all I
09:08 - want to see how they're doing this so
09:10 - that we can properly override it so
09:14 - which one this is the button correct
09:26 - it's interesting all right so we're
09:28 - gonna move this all the way over so that
09:30 - we can see our dev tools and our our
09:37 - button here okay yeah so that's what we
09:40 - want you want this one let's see what
09:43 - changes interesting all right so let's
09:50 - see
10:00 - trying to see any type of change
10:03 - happening here we could maybe check oops
10:06 - check the computed maybe we'll see it
10:09 - better there okay see nothing there
10:23 - let's yeah interesting okay
10:41 - with
10:44 - hmm
10:47 - I this is kind of odd I would kind of
10:50 - expect to see something changing right
10:55 - let's see
11:02 - and it since you seen
11:23 - so I just heard something beep on my
11:25 - computer I wanted to see what message I
11:29 - was getting do you ever have too many
11:32 - messenger things open at once and you
11:35 - you're not sure which one you're getting
11:37 - a message on that's that's how it is for
11:41 - me right now all right actually I
11:45 - haven't even checked the live chat at
11:47 - all yet let me let me check this and see
11:48 - if anyone has any ideas let me see
12:05 - okay I don't see anything yet also if
12:10 - you're new the way I do things is I wait
12:13 - until this 25 minute timer is up and
12:16 - then I go to the live chat and answer
12:18 - all your questions so please don't feel
12:20 - bad if I don't see or answer your
12:22 - question right away I will answer it on
12:25 - our question answer breaks or at the end
12:28 - of the stream I I stopped coding and I
12:32 - just go through the live chat and answer
12:34 - questions alright let's find out what
12:42 - this this is like the I think I
12:44 - mentioned last week I feel like a
12:46 - detective when I'm searching through
12:49 - some foreign CSS or this potentially
12:56 - could be some JavaScript stuff going on
12:57 - too but just searching through dev tools
13:02 - trying to figure out what's going on and
13:04 - how to how to change it that's that's a
13:09 - lot of what ends up happening when when
13:12 - I'm editing somebody else's stuff
13:22 - yes
13:42 - okay
14:03 - all right it's got to be this one I mean
14:06 - this has all the other styles
14:37 - there we go okay now I'm seeing
14:40 - something different well I don't know
14:45 - how I missed that before but uh here we
14:48 - have some hover some hover styles are
14:55 - those are styles and some of them yeah
15:01 - those are our styles let's see these are
15:06 - the styles that we're trying to override
15:21 - she's gotta be another hover style
15:34 - these are our styles again
16:27 - so the width isn't even you see in dev
16:32 - tools if you see a kind of grayed out a
16:35 - little bit then that's that's not
16:39 - directly getting the width from anything
16:41 - any styles on this particular component
16:46 - transitions
17:17 - it's not taking our border-radius too
17:33 - well let's do what we know we need to do
17:37 - we need to get that border-radius
17:40 - working in particular on this isn't even
17:48 - hover style let's go ahead and put it
17:54 - throw it important on that water radius
18:01 - and
18:09 - and see what else we need we can check
18:16 - let's take this hover off for a second
18:18 - just to see what else is being
18:21 - overwritten these are ours
18:38 - okay
19:00 - we could put important on our box shadow
19:07 - and
19:13 - just what I'm let's actually let's see
19:19 - how this looks now probably auto logged
19:25 - out of this yep I am okay to login login
19:36 - on another screen logs me out it's
19:41 - pretty fast log out for Salesforce I
19:43 - don't know if that's by default or if
19:46 - the admins for for my University set it
19:49 - like that
19:59 - [Applause]
20:02 - just what we were working on no it
20:05 - wasn't that
20:29 - hmm all right I'm gonna have to go in
20:32 - and find I see it there it is
20:43 - all right so if you haven't seen us
20:46 - working on this the last three three
20:49 - streams this is not an ideal workflow of
20:53 - having to copy and paste things over but
20:56 - since I'm working in Salesforce this is
21:00 - what I have to work with right now I'm
21:01 - not aware of a different way to do it if
21:06 - there were some other way to integrate
21:08 - this better with my normal workflow I
21:12 - definitely would do that and fresh
21:24 - what's whoops forget a sign in here no I
21:32 - don't okay
21:37 - let's let me grab my password from the
21:43 - browser while I'm actually logged into
21:45 - my LastPass
21:57 - sorry about this I should have refreshed
22:00 - everything beforehand and got logged in
22:33 - oh okay not bad we still have that weird
22:38 - thing going on but at least we've taken
22:45 - care of everything else all right we
22:50 - just have to figure this up okay so
22:56 - let's see try turning off padding and
23:02 - hover say all right so we have some
23:03 - ideas here in the live chat about what
23:05 - to do let me read through these
23:10 - okay so John Hanson says some of the
23:13 - styles that are giving you problems may
23:15 - stem from higher up the Dom okay yeah I
23:18 - thought that but I didn't really check
23:20 - that much higher so I will double check
23:23 - that hard says check the padding
23:26 - okay cool I will check that and John
23:31 - says if the buttons inside a flex div
23:33 - its width will get determined by its
23:35 - alignment flex start okay let's let me
23:43 - check the padding first cuz I think
23:44 - that'll be the easiest thing to do since
23:46 - we're already on this component so let
23:50 - me go to computed and just see what
23:53 - padding we have 15 all around and now
23:57 - let's let's hover and let's check out
24:00 - the padding now oh yeah we have a
24:04 - different padding for sure okay cool
24:08 - let's switch it up bill 15 all around no
24:10 - matter what and see if that fixes it
24:22 - yep that looks good okay cool so we
24:26 - should be able to just set our padding
24:29 - hello I see I see what's happening it
24:36 - looks like our padding was being
24:46 - overridden on here but not when we did a
24:53 - hover okay that makes sense because when
24:57 - the the default CSS probably just put
24:59 - padding on the the button styles and
25:03 - then didn't bother putting it on the
25:04 - hover styles which you wouldn't normally
25:06 - do that that makes sense okay so this
25:09 - should fix it let's double check it and
25:12 - then we can move on to the next thing
25:31 - No all right we still have something
25:34 - else going on so it's no longer the
25:38 - padding because you see it's not it's
25:40 - not changing shape so we've solved one
25:43 - thing now is its line hide font size
25:50 - something like that let's see whoops
25:57 - however alright let's see make sure this
26:03 - is actually triggering it yep there we
26:06 - go alright so let's check our hover yeah
26:17 - let's check our computers who we have
26:18 - going on here trans okay so we have a
26:22 - text transform which should be fine
26:24 - because I think we are already doing
26:25 - that text size adjust where are we
26:29 - getting that from
26:39 - that's weird
26:41 - let's actually look to the font look
26:43 - bigger I think it does I think it might
26:47 - be the font size let me go back here and
26:49 - check our font size so we have font
26:53 - weights line Heights and font size that
26:56 - could probably all be okay so we have 14
26:59 - here and that's not hovered I think
27:04 - hovered I think it was 16 right font 16
27:14 - yeah alright so it looks like our font
27:16 - size is going from 14 to 16 I would like
27:21 - it to be 16 no matter what so let's add
27:25 - an important ear and this is the same
27:29 - thing that was happening with the
27:30 - padding right so the default styles have
27:32 - font size 14
27:34 - so that was overriding our 16 but then
27:37 - it's hover state did not have a font
27:40 - size at all
27:41 - so our 16 was actually working so this
27:46 - should now work
27:59 - I thought earlier that the font-size
28:00 - looked different but it was hard to tell
28:02 - with all the other things changing there
28:06 - we go perfect okay all right so check
28:11 - that out we've got a slight hover effect
28:14 - which I like much better than that
28:17 - what was happening before we're having
28:21 - just a huge change although now that I
28:24 - think about it it may not have had that
28:27 - large change by default we might have
28:29 - inadvertently caused that hover effect
28:33 - to happen by some of the styles that we
28:35 - had applied earlier before we even on
28:38 - this page so I think that that's that
28:41 - was probably the case all right let's
28:44 - get rid of this hover as well while
28:46 - we're here that's a hover we want to get
28:57 - rid of that color and the text
28:59 - decoration I think we already have a
29:03 - hover here yep
29:09 - so let's just put it in portent for
29:12 - these I want to give my disclaimer on
29:18 - using important so you've probably heard
29:20 - this before but just in case you don't
29:22 - normally want to use important if you're
29:24 - writing your own CSS for a project from
29:27 - scratch
29:27 - don't use important right because you
29:30 - have complete control you can just
29:31 - change how you have things set up and
29:34 - either through adding classes or
29:38 - changing the order in your CSS you
29:41 - should you should be able to make things
29:43 - work just through specificity and then
29:46 - keep everything cascading once you had
29:49 - important it breaks the Cascade so it
29:53 - doesn't matter like right now this is
29:55 - just an a right it's not specific at all
29:57 - I mean I guess we have an a:hover in
29:58 - here right but somebody can make this
30:01 - super specific and put like HTML body
30:04 - div
30:05 - and it would still be overridden by this
30:10 - because we put important there
30:12 - so you see how it breaks somebody could
30:14 - put inline Styles on a specific a zag
30:17 - and it would still be broken and and
30:20 - overridden by this important so we're
30:23 - only using it in this case because we
30:26 - don't have access or control of much of
30:29 - what's going on in terms of the mark-up
30:30 - and what's going on in terms of the
30:33 - other styles that are being added to the
30:36 - page in various places so in this case
30:40 - we're stuck with important is one of our
30:42 - last options and that's what it should
30:43 - always be a last option all right I'm
30:49 - not even going to test that because
30:50 - that's very simple it should definitely
30:53 - work now let me check how much time we
30:56 - have okay so it's almost up for that
31:00 - session let's add in that extra Pomodoro
31:05 - session and Mark that is done and let's
31:13 - go inside of let's just go ahead and or
31:20 - next time one we'll do it we'll change
31:21 - the colors and as a part of that we'll
31:26 - probably do these together we're gonna
31:27 - change the indicator colors as well okay
31:36 - I'll be able to pull this over goodness
31:39 - I've got really what um wait how did we
31:45 - get it did we get logged out again it's
31:52 - possible I accidentally hit sign out
31:54 - when I was
31:56 - mousing over it okay let me grab my
32:02 - password again
32:20 - okay all right so we're logged in again
32:23 - and all we need to see now is the
32:27 - sidebar and my sessions almost up so I'm
32:32 - just gonna go ahead and break now do
32:35 - five minutes in the live chat so I'll be
32:37 - starting at the top and just working my
32:38 - way down answering as many questions as
32:41 - I can
32:52 - that's
32:57 - okay horseshit asked if I'd seen PR 54
33:00 - which by now I've already said it I have
33:03 - seen its merch now
33:06 - Arshad says I saw an inspirational for
33:09 - loop so if if y'all can see this in the
33:11 - live chat will probably make more sense
33:12 - but for age equals 0
33:15 - a when age is greater than or if age is
33:20 - greater than or equal to life dot length
33:22 - knowledge plus plus that's cool I like
33:25 - that
33:45 - okay so John Hanson says please
33:48 - implement styled components you will
33:50 - save yourself a lot of grief you can use
33:52 - an imported theme as a wrapper and still
33:54 - be able to cleanly style components as
33:57 - standalone components okay yeah and hard
34:04 - shipments and styled components are
34:06 - specific to react yeah so I mean
34:08 - obviously we can't use them with
34:09 - Salesforce but we can start using them
34:12 - on our other react projects
34:24 - okay haha Irish it says that button took
34:32 - a long time to debug yes it did John
34:38 - Hanson says I usually shed it's here if
34:40 - I'm forced to use important yeah it
34:44 - feels a little bit like giving up like
34:47 - oh yeah yeah there's got to be a better
34:50 - way but I just don't want to do it so
34:52 - let's just put important in there yeah I
34:54 - I find myself using important a lot less
34:57 - than I used to today I probably used an
35:01 - important so far in the half hour we've
35:03 - been streaming I've used important more
35:04 - than I've probably used it in the last
35:06 - month or two I it depends on the project
35:12 - though if it's something like this where
35:13 - I have to deal with already existing
35:18 - code I tend to use it a lot more alright
35:39 - all right I think I actually there's not
35:42 - that much in the live chat so I think
35:43 - I've gotten to the bottom of it so
35:45 - that's cool so I shouldn't go over my
35:48 - time here Harshit says she checked NXT
35:59 - shared CEO Diane her was that the
36:03 - one that you built the chat thing yeah
36:12 - okay
36:19 - cool yeah I definitely check that out
36:21 - that is really cool so if you haven't
36:27 - already checked it out harsh I built
36:32 - this really cool chat site and it's NXT
36:36 - share dot Co dot I n so yeah it was
36:42 - really cool I checked that out Friday
36:45 - that's Friday yeah I was really
36:47 - impressed by that all right well since
36:55 - I'm out of stuff on the live chat I may
36:58 - as well start the next next session so
37:01 - yeah let's get started on this so if you
37:04 - ask anything after this point I will get
37:06 - through it after this next session this
37:08 - will be our last code session and then
37:10 - we'll just do all question-and-answer
37:17 - and I got a question in there right at
37:19 - the end says how's the weather today
37:21 - it's a little bit cold and rainy where
37:25 - I'm at it's about 40 degrees it was in
37:28 - the upper 30s this morning but I think
37:30 - it's in the mid 40s now and it's it's
37:32 - rainy so it's appropriate weather for
37:36 - this time of year all right
37:42 - I actually don't mind that 40s or 50s
37:45 - and rain I think it's kind of nice I'm
37:49 - not sure why but boys I've always liked
37:53 - it when it's dark outside and about 50
37:57 - degrees and slightly raining I don't
38:02 - know if I would say it's my favorite but
38:04 - it's pretty close to it okay
38:10 - I'm just playing around a little bit
38:12 - just to think about what colors I want
38:16 - here we will probably end up going with
38:19 - a lot of white like we normally do now
38:27 - I'm thinking about how far I want to
38:29 - take this now let's let's see first
38:35 - we'll stick with the colors but just to
38:37 - let you know what I'm thinking right now
38:39 - I'm wondering how far could we change
38:42 - this to look like what we normally do I
38:45 - I do kind of like that it has this year
38:50 - that's that that's not bad that's a nice
38:53 - indicator so I don't want to change that
38:55 - but whenever it is actually open I think
38:59 - it might be nicer if it did look closer
39:02 - to what we normally do well we'll see
39:09 - once we get in here and see some of the
39:11 - markup it'll be pretty obvious how
39:14 - difficult it would be to try to make
39:17 - this look exactly like our other side
39:21 - now sir as close as possible oops and
39:25 - actually we forgot to change this color
39:27 - too did was that on another one change
39:29 - I'll change the icon colors as another
39:32 - another to do so I wondered why I didn't
39:35 - didn't do that one all right so let's
39:44 - change the background color first and
39:47 - we'll have to change the font color as
39:49 - well because we won't be able to read
39:50 - anything so let's go up so we get the
39:55 - container div where the color supplied
40:00 - there we go
40:03 - yep that's where the colors applied so
40:06 - let's switch that up all right let's go
40:21 - with white and let's see I'm gonna make
40:26 - this whoops black wanna make that I'm
40:37 - gonna have to go down lower okay
40:39 - well at first we can at least put this
40:40 - background color on target apps next
40:45 - application sidebar this for really
40:48 - change when not expand it yeah we want
40:52 - to put it on that base style so it
40:53 - applies to both forms of the sidebar
40:57 - okay
40:58 - so si bar let's put this below the nav
41:03 - bar and put it right in here and sidebar
41:20 - and
41:32 - okay
41:35 - and then let's see where the colors up
41:41 - being applied color
41:58 - that's weird
42:03 - to share it again
42:08 - oh okay inherit all right and see that's
42:12 - the first time okay on so we're gonna
42:17 - have to do an h1 and then let's go down
42:20 - to the vowels and then a okay h2 why
42:33 - well would you have an h2 inside of an a
42:36 - tag inside of an li anyway I can
42:45 - I kind of see what they're doing here
42:48 - but really it wouldn't it be better to
42:50 - just leave the headers as this and not
42:52 - have them repeated as H tags I gotta
42:56 - check this now because if these aren't H
42:58 - tags then I'm gonna be upset okay at
43:02 - least they are H tags okay so I have
43:11 - enough to do this where we add sidebar
43:16 - okay so let's go target X application
43:22 - sidebar oops
43:24 - and we want to get the H ones and then
43:33 - sidebar h2s and the color
43:41 - let me grab me grab our dark color from
43:47 - somewhere else
43:57 - hmm
44:03 - I don't see it let's just make it
44:12 - I'm always I never want to type out the
44:16 - rgba colors by my myself I just I always
44:21 - want to do it like this I don't know why
44:28 - a father would have been faster in that
44:32 - case you just type it out myself
44:35 - all right now let's put this here
44:42 - and I do want to see what this looks
44:47 - like before we go on
45:03 - okay well some of what we did worked and
45:06 - some did not so we may just have to put
45:10 - important on that and move on
45:13 - let's check it out for a second
45:23 - yeah yeah same same reason it was being
45:26 - overridden with our button styles so oh
45:32 - they're okay we actually need to change
45:38 - the font as well so it's good to know
45:43 - all right so let's add and pour it here
45:46 - and let's go up and grab our font
45:56 - and
46:03 - actually let's try to do it important up
46:06 - here I don't think there's anywhere
46:10 - where we wouldn't want to use this font
46:14 - so John Hanson I just saw your your
46:21 - comment had the little devil emoji with
46:24 - important oh there we go
46:51 - all right yeah it works okay
46:56 - well not for everything so our h1 it did
47:04 - not work
47:05 - that's wait a second
47:12 - display:none
47:19 - why do we have
47:53 - oh this is weird
48:02 - our button color is now not working
48:29 - all right let's move this button color
48:32 - back to testing and we'll look at that
48:34 - in a little bit but right now this is
48:39 - what we're working on
48:50 - so in each one
49:01 - did we not have text there am i looking
49:04 - at the wrong element maybe I'm looking
49:05 - the wrong thing I am sorry about that I
49:09 - was looking at the wrong place
49:18 - okay and this is not an h1 it's a span
49:26 - so let's change this first of all let's
49:29 - make sure they're not setting the color
49:31 - they are okay but they're setting it on
49:36 - this so we should be fine to put that
49:41 - here and these are yeah let's go ahead
49:47 - and just do both of these now actually
49:57 - we're not gonna you're not gonna want to
49:59 - do them together we want them to be
50:00 - different colors but I'll just copy them
50:04 - copy the classes over okay
50:13 - uh I didn't copy okay let's try this
50:22 - again I'll get the right stuff
50:29 - yeah and let's see
50:41 - let's try to nest this
50:49 - and see if we can override things
50:51 - through nesting well it's not really
50:57 - necessary I'm thinking in sass terms
50:58 - like normally I would nest this is
51:00 - that's not really what you would say and
51:03 - CSS alright so for this we're gonna go
51:17 - with that green color that Franciscan
51:19 - University green and for this one we'll
51:23 - use this same color that we have up here
51:28 - which actually if we're going to do that
51:32 - we should just do it here okay
52:06 - really we're gonna have to use important
52:36 - oh that's why background-color sector
52:41 - certification
53:02 - background-color
53:08 - that's why and then for this that's just
53:11 - putting Fortin here
53:34 - I'm not sure how many more videos we'll
53:37 - have on this I I wanted to do enough
53:43 - videos to be able to make a playlist out
53:47 - of this that would be reasonable so
53:48 - we're at four videos for this this may
53:52 - be the last one I may do one more I
53:54 - don't really want to spend a ton of time
53:56 - I haven't really been getting a lot of
53:58 - views for this kind of thing so I just
54:00 - don't think there's that many people
54:01 - that are interested and this kind of
54:04 - stuff I think there's more interest in
54:06 - the react stuff that we've been doing so
54:08 - I'd like to switch back I didn't really
54:12 - want to just stop right in the middle of
54:13 - it I'd like to get it to some point of
54:15 - completion before we stop that's okay
54:24 - not bad I mean color wise it's that we
54:28 - can at least see everything now I really
54:31 - don't know about this this change here I
54:35 - mean I don't I don't mind this crossing
54:38 - to make it an X but I don't really like
54:40 - this size change so I think I want to
54:47 - get rid of that so let me add that as
54:52 - another to do that falls outside of our
54:57 - scope of changing colors
55:06 - is it a hover effect as an AFF ECT or a
55:11 - hover effect like EF Fe CT I can never
55:14 - remember I always ask my wife because
55:16 - she's an English teacher and she
55:19 - actually teaches English at the college
55:21 - that I work at and she always knows okay
55:33 - and we've changed the colors for the
55:37 - side nav I guess the one thing we could
55:40 - change the colors of these dividers do
55:45 - we want actually a masseuse do we even
55:47 - want to have those dividers there
55:49 - anymore is that necessary we don't
55:53 - normally do dividers between every menu
55:57 - item do we like let's check we don't
56:02 - want to hear no we don't we have them
56:04 - between different you know categories of
56:07 - not in this sense but like different
56:10 - sections of our menu but this isn't
56:13 - necessarily a different section these
56:15 - these all play the same role you know
56:19 - for now I'm not gonna do anything with
56:21 - them what I probably wouldn't add is you
56:26 - know this this hover behind let's do
56:30 - that let's let's add a hover behind now
56:34 - this is where it might get a little
56:37 - weird are we even going to be able to do
56:43 - that same hover because you know where
56:46 - did where is this extent oh actually we
56:48 - need a we need a shadow on this as well
56:51 - this looks really weird so we need a
56:54 - shadow and we can we can definitely
56:57 - shorten this there's no reason that it
56:59 - has to be that long so let's add these
57:14 - and we're going to
57:28 - okay
57:35 - and let me
57:44 - we want to change this color
57:52 - there we go I like that better
58:11 - and
58:25 - yeah let me we do have shadows on here
58:27 - correct no we don't we know we don't
58:31 - have a shadow let's let's find one where
58:33 - we we bring that out so okay all right
58:39 - so maybe we don't have a shadow normally
58:42 - but it just graze everything out so we
58:45 - have this overlay
58:55 - but in this case we don't really want
58:57 - the overlay right because you can I
58:59 - don't know it does automatically close
59:01 - okay well then we probably should add an
59:04 - overlay this will do what will either
59:07 - hover or overlay I don't want to do the
59:13 - border because you can see we really
59:16 - only do the border if we have it fixed
59:18 - let's let's shrink this up don't see
59:20 - what we actually have on
59:22 - yeah we don't have the border or at
59:25 - least it's not obvious but that there is
59:28 - a border there yeah so let's let's keep
59:31 - stick with that and so that's what we'll
59:38 - do so we'll either do an overlay or a
59:41 - shadow
59:55 - actually you know what we're gonna add a
59:57 - shadow' no matter what because when it's
60:01 - no I'm gonna do that
60:10 - hey we got back to that screen I don't
60:15 - know if you remember but I think of the
60:16 - first day we worked on this we got to
60:19 - this screen and it looked terrible and I
60:21 - didn't I couldn't figure out how to get
60:22 - back to it okay that's cool well now we
60:28 - know how to get back to it I just have
60:30 - to hit this button
60:33 - okay so we'll need something here maybe
60:37 - here this would be a good place to have
60:41 - a border
60:42 - I may have to think about this so we're
60:46 - gonna add maybe add the shadow here I'll
60:52 - just add some notes maybe an overlay
61:07 - we're closed okay all right so I have to
61:14 - mess around with a couple of these
61:15 - couple options that we have here and
61:19 - that's about it for this
61:21 - so let's um let's see colors yeah so
61:30 - we've we've changed the colors I think
61:32 - we're safe to mark that off where we
61:37 - don't really need to do anything else
61:38 - with colors for the side now and yep all
61:49 - right not bad so we only got two to do
61:54 - stun but we came in well with the
61:57 - exception in this one where it took
61:59 - twice as long as we thought the colors
62:01 - were right on target in terms of time so
62:04 - not bad
62:05 - I may have to just end up by default
62:08 - putting important on everything because
62:10 - it seems like no matter how much I try
62:12 - to not have to use important I have to
62:15 - use it on almost every element so our
62:21 - new strategy might just be use important
62:23 - oh man and I just got a message on slack
62:27 - that there is food in the kitchen
62:30 - free food so I definitely have to end
62:33 - this before my meeting so that I can
62:35 - stop in and get free food I have one of
62:38 - my co-workers always lets me know if
62:42 - there's free food so I joke with her and
62:46 - say that's actually in a job description
62:47 - that she has to do that but I appreciate
62:51 - it she knows how much I enjoy free food
62:57 - that's kind of pretty much the the one
63:00 - benefit I can see the coming into work
63:02 - instead of working from home that I
63:04 - would miss it's getting the free food
63:07 - that is frequently here at work okay let
63:14 - me scroll up and now at this point I'm
63:20 - gonna do Question and Answer so if you
63:23 - have any questions please put them in
63:25 - the live chat now even if you don't have
63:27 - a question appreciate it if you if you
63:30 - can if you'd stick around and help
63:33 - answer some of the questions because I
63:34 - certainly don't have all the answers to
63:36 - everything and I appreciate having
63:39 - different opinions on things as well but
63:43 - if you got to take off thanks for
63:44 - watching I should be back on Wednesday
63:46 - and I will not be back tomorrow but if
63:49 - you need to send me a message or
63:51 - something on social media or whatever
63:54 - I'll I'll be online I'll just be working
63:57 - from home
63:59 - okay let's trying to find where I left
64:07 - off okay
64:17 - sciences go bucs yeah
64:34 - oh okay harsh it says will you be
64:36 - running post CSS autoprefixer at the end
64:40 - of your CSS that's a great idea
64:43 - I actually I really like to run that but
64:46 - normally I have it set up to run
64:48 - automatically and in this case we don't
64:50 - have any type of build tools running so
64:53 - I probably would have forgot about that
64:55 - if you hadn't mentioned it so thank you
64:57 - so let's autoprefixer awesome thank you
65:07 - Harshit that is a wonderful idea okay
65:18 - John says I think most builds include
65:20 - post CSS though when you do dev tools in
65:22 - the browser much of what is added gets
65:25 - crossed out anyhow yeah let's see Anna
65:32 - says what's the hardest you've ever
65:34 - worth I think maybe I'll give two
65:37 - answers from that one will be code
65:39 - related and one non code related so I
65:43 - worked well actually some of you all may
65:48 - remember when it was right around the
65:51 - time to launch the catechetical
65:54 - Institute website which was project one
65:56 - that we worked on I worked some crazy
65:59 - hours for at least the last two weeks of
66:03 - that project I worked almost double my
66:05 - normal amount of hours so we're talking
66:08 - like 70 to 80 hours a week that was
66:13 - pretty crazy
66:13 - I think I worked for like 14 hours one
66:17 - day that was wild I think I streamed for
66:22 - five hours one day I think I streamed
66:24 - and then took a break and it streamed
66:26 - again so that was pretty crazy I have
66:32 - done I've done like and where I've
66:38 - worked pretty much all day and then as
66:42 - late as I could stay up at night went to
66:44 - sleep for couple hours woke up again and
66:46 - started working
66:47 - on a project so in terms of code that's
66:50 - the hardest just trying to put out as
66:54 - much code as I possibly can and stay up
66:57 - as late as I can but in terms of in
67:01 - general how what's the hardest I've ever
67:04 - worked I don't know I've had some jobs
67:09 - that were that were tough physically I
67:14 - used to work for for a city in West
67:20 - Virginia called Weirton so I worked for
67:23 - the city of Wooten which that's the city
67:26 - I grew up in and I did that for about
67:30 - six years but it was on it was seasonal
67:32 - so I didn't always they didn't have
67:35 - enough for me to do during the
67:36 - wintertime usually but that job was a
67:38 - lot of like eight hours a day pushing a
67:42 - lawn mower doing maintenance work
67:46 - generally like lifting things working on
67:49 - whatever needed fixed whatever needed
67:51 - cleaned so like that was somewhat
67:53 - physically demanding is like you're just
67:56 - on your feet every day that matter how
67:57 - hot it is how cold it is like you're
68:01 - working so but I was young I mean this
68:04 - was when I was a teenager and so it it
68:10 - wasn't that bad then I think back to it
68:12 - now I think man I'd be sore if I tried
68:13 - to do that now that was tough and I'll
68:18 - tell you what I used to be a manager an
68:21 - assistant manager at a Burger King
68:22 - restaurant it's a fast-food restaurant
68:24 - that was really tough because that would
68:28 - work these shifts and sometimes I'd work
68:30 - ten hours straight and we'd be so busy
68:32 - that I just couldn't stop like I
68:34 - literally could not take a minute break
68:37 - because we always had people in there
68:39 - and we are always understaffed so I
68:44 - couldn't just manage it was like you're
68:47 - making sandwiches you got a headset on
68:49 - you're taking orders you're running the
68:50 - cash register all at the same time that
68:52 - you're trying to make sure everybody
68:54 - else was doing their job that was wild
68:56 - that was just like exhausting
69:00 - and you work a shift like that and close
69:03 - up and like on the weekend you'd close
69:06 - up at 2:00 a.m. during the week you
69:07 - close up at midnight and then if you
69:10 - work the next shift the next stiff shift
69:13 - started at 4:00 a.m. so you couldn't get
69:16 - full amount of sleep so anyway I'm sure
69:19 - y'all don't care about how to manage a
69:21 - fast-food restaurant but that was that
69:24 - was really wild just in terms of like
69:28 - working that much without a break all
69:33 - right let's see how cool John Hanson
69:43 - said time for dictionary.com to see how
69:45 - that affects or affects things okay John
69:52 - says the the hover behind sounds good so
69:54 - we're talking about on a hover behind
69:56 - these items I'd also add a shadow' to
70:01 - help define its needed for the Seidman
70:05 - yeah it's definitely needed now that
70:07 - it's the same color I mean I could see
70:09 - why they didn't have it before
70:10 - it wasn't exactly necessary the shadow
70:15 - could just show when the side I was out
70:18 - yeah that's true I mean really I guess
70:21 - when you think about like in terms of
70:24 - material design of everything's on like
70:28 - a different level the side nav is
70:31 - actually on a higher level unless I'm
70:34 - remembering this wrong the side nav is
70:37 - on a higher level than the the paper
70:39 - like the you know the normal level so be
70:43 - like Niazi zero right if we're thinking
70:45 - z-index so it would make sense that
70:49 - there would be a shadow no matter what
70:52 - since since we have the partially open
70:54 - state and the open fully open state we
70:57 - don't really have a closed state so if
71:02 - there should be a shadow yeah okay we
71:07 - have this sub I guess we can keep this
71:11 - sub header here
71:13 - I'm not a huge fan because you all know
71:18 - I don't really like thick headers and
71:19 - this makes it really thick but yeah I
71:22 - mean this side nav realistically should
71:25 - probably be at the same level I'm gonna
71:27 - have to double-check the material design
71:29 - Docs to make sure that the app bar which
71:32 - is what this is called in the in the
71:33 - docs and the side drawer
71:35 - I think it's called side drawer are
71:38 - supposed to be at the same level of the
71:41 - z-index level so I shouldn't say see
71:50 - index I don't want you to get confused
71:51 - with CSSA index I mean that the Z height
71:55 - level surface was XYZ coordinates right
71:58 - we have our x and y coordinate is it is
72:03 - X this way yeah I think X Y trying to
72:09 - remember back to high school math class
72:10 - and then your Z coordinate would be like
72:14 - depth right or height however you want
72:16 - to think about it so that's what I'm
72:18 - talking about
72:18 - oh cool innocence thanks for the stream
72:24 - you're welcome thank you so much for
72:27 - watching and for asking questions in the
72:30 - in the live chat I appreciate it alright
72:37 - John Hansen says react equals mystery I
72:41 - figured how this array dot fine and
72:44 - change state to the array but to use the
72:48 - new array as a parameter and then using
72:52 - this state state dot arrayed key value
72:55 - is confusing that sounds confusing
73:00 - reading it I probably I'd have to think
73:03 - about that you see the code to
73:05 - understand really understand that there
73:10 - are some weird confusing things about
73:11 - react I really like react but I've
73:15 - definitely been confused at times and
73:17 - thought what why isn't this working
73:20 - so
73:22 - usually whenever it finally works it
73:25 - makes sense why it works and why it
73:27 - didn't work the other way but getting to
73:29 - that point of realizing what the right
73:31 - way to do it is is can be a challenge
73:35 - sometimes luckily I have you all to let
73:38 - me know and it usually doesn't take that
73:39 - long when when you're watching to let me
73:43 - know what the right way is but it can
73:48 - definitely take a while sometimes let's
73:52 - see
73:53 - Rohini says hello from India hey how's
73:57 - it going thanks for watching from India
74:00 - I know it's late what is it
74:03 - well 45 right in the morning right now
74:07 - or at night however you want to think
74:09 - about it John answer says it works and
74:16 - it is logical to react but Wow yeah yeah
74:20 - that's what what is this angle I seen
74:23 - this on different social media but it's
74:27 - stuff like react makes complicated
74:30 - things simple and simple things
74:32 - complicated some something like that
74:36 - yeah but that's I would agree with that
74:39 - statement right there's just there's
74:41 - some things that I used to do with
74:44 - jQuery you know back when back a year
74:47 - ago when I used to be into jQuery
74:49 - I don't wanna don't to make it sound
74:51 - like it's been that long time but you do
74:55 - so much a query it would be the simplest
74:56 - thing in the world just so easy and then
75:00 - with react it's like how can I do this
75:01 - exact same thing and it seems so much
75:05 - more complex but some things are really
75:10 - easy with reactant and I remember that
75:13 - them being just super difficult with
75:16 - jQuery and I just had all the spaghetti
75:18 - code when I tried to do it so for me at
75:22 - least the the transition from jQuery
75:25 - based stuff to react stuff has had more
75:29 - benefits than drawbacks it definitely
75:32 - took me longer to build the same fun
75:34 - action ality when I first started but I
75:36 - think now I'm at the level where I
75:41 - faster with reacts not only that but
75:44 - everything's more reliable with react
75:46 - and I think it's a heck of a lot easier
75:48 - to other people for other people to read
75:50 - the code and contribute to it
75:53 - I still like dread going back to some of
75:56 - my old applications that I built with
75:59 - with jQuery so like we've read on it
76:02 - like the Resource Center that we redid
76:04 - in react I'm so glad that I never have
76:06 - to go back to the original and look at
76:09 - it again
76:09 - I didn't delete the code it's it's still
76:11 - on git and github as a private room
76:14 - faucet honey I'll probably never make it
76:17 - public but anyway and then now the
76:23 - bulletin that we're working on when that
76:26 - finally launches then the I won't have
76:29 - to look back at the other code and that
76:31 - will the jQuery version will also remain
76:34 - a Friday treat actually I don't really
76:41 - care if you all would look at that if
76:43 - you really wanted to I make it public
76:44 - but the only thing I'm worried about is
76:46 - making sure I don't have any any keys or
76:52 - anything that I shouldn't have in there
76:55 - because since it was a private repo I
76:57 - never bothered removing any keys so I'd
77:00 - have to double check on that okay John
77:05 - says it sounds LOL sounds like my
77:09 - thoughts on jquery yes it's a different
77:11 - hat one has to wear even from JavaScript
77:14 - yeah for sure
77:15 - alright John says love to see it alright
77:17 - cool
77:18 - I'll have to yeah I'll see about making
77:23 - it public I'm pretty sure the Resource
77:26 - Center one I can make public I think the
77:28 - only like keys that I had was the I was
77:34 - storing data in Google sheets so I had
77:37 - like the URL to store things in a Google
77:39 - sheet but I'm no longer using those
77:41 - sheets so I can just
77:47 - shut it off so that you can't use that
77:49 - anymore and that that should be fine
77:54 - the the bullets in one we'll see yeah
78:07 - aha
78:08 - I may have to do some things before I
78:10 - can make the bullets in one public we
78:11 - may have to may I be after I launch the
78:14 - newer version of it the react version
78:17 - but I'm pretty sure I could also make
78:19 - that public as well so so you can see it
78:22 - it might off to double-check everything
78:25 - but I'm pretty sure I will be able to
78:26 - make in public all right almost to the
78:31 - bottom of the live shot here Blake says
78:32 - I'm working on like three projects what
78:36 - do I do I want to do them all at the
78:38 - same time well I'm kind of in the same
78:43 - situation right now so I have this
78:45 - project we're still working on the
78:48 - bulletin and I'm trying to sort out some
78:50 - bugs on the Resource Center I just
78:55 - finished up that react native projects
78:58 - for the Udacity nano degree which I'm
79:02 - still going to make that video for the
79:03 - nanodegree I have not forgotten about
79:05 - that so yeah so anyway when I have lots
79:10 - of projects to do I make sure that I
79:14 - take notes so I don't get confused and I
79:16 - do i do Trello boards and I make sure I
79:19 - write down notes on the cards so I can
79:21 - jump back and forth I have a lot more
79:24 - windows open on my on my computer when
79:28 - it's like that but it's definitely
79:31 - doable it also helps if the projects are
79:36 - somewhat related then it's nice because
79:38 - you can use what you learn on one
79:40 - project on the other project it's kind
79:43 - of like like when I was in college it
79:45 - was nice when I took classes that
79:47 - overlapped in content so that you've
79:50 - already learned it in one class and then
79:51 - maybe a few weeks later you're tested on
79:53 - it in another class and so it's like you
79:57 - don't really have to spend as much work
79:59 - because
80:00 - because you took the classes at the same
80:01 - time you're learning the same material
80:04 - and it cuts down on the amount of time
80:07 - you have to study projects are the same
80:09 - if you can do similar projects at the
80:11 - same time you can just recycle code from
80:14 - one project to another and complete both
80:17 - of the projects faster than it would
80:19 - take you if you only did one so it can
80:24 - work it can definitely be more
80:26 - beneficial to work on multiple things at
80:28 - once it just depends on what projects
80:30 - they are
80:44 - oh cool so Rohini says visiting this
80:47 - channel after three months dude super
80:51 - cool series of tutorials from free code
80:54 - camp excellent job guys
80:56 - mission target front-end JavaScript and
80:59 - design Jessie will watch all your
81:02 - tutorials ah
81:03 - that's that's awesome that's really
81:06 - awesome I'm glad you glad you like it I
81:09 - think we've come a long way in the last
81:11 - in the last three months I think
81:14 - I certainly have come a long way with
81:16 - with all of your help in my
81:18 - understanding of react and I think maybe
81:22 - it like into my skills as a live
81:25 - streamer
81:26 - I don't know you all let me know but I
81:29 - feel like I'm able to better balance
81:32 - questions in code now for a while there
81:35 - I would get off track way too easily
81:37 - and I feel sorry for everybody that was
81:40 - watching those earlier streams but I
81:43 - think we got a decent system now and it
81:46 - seems seems to be working I get less
81:48 - complaints that I talk too much now I
81:50 - use I used to get comments on the videos
81:54 - and in the live chat like stop talking
81:57 - more code which I thought was funny and
82:00 - I agreed with okay and after saying that
82:06 - it really is time for me to stop talking
82:08 - because I have six minutes before my
82:10 - meeting starts so let me hurry up and
82:13 - see the last few things that were in
82:17 - here to see Jessie please upload
82:23 - previous tutorials on github trying to
82:28 - think I think everything that we've done
82:30 - in the videos is on github so some of
82:34 - the stuff that I'll upload stuff that
82:36 - I've done but I haven't done videos on
82:37 - it so you can certainly check it out and
82:39 - ask me questions about it if you want
82:41 - but some of my earlier stuff will be
82:45 - better examples of what not to do and
82:47 - what to do because we've since you know
82:51 - learn better ways to do it or at least
82:53 - I've learned better ways to do it so
82:56 - but I still will put them up there as
82:58 - well I'm not I'm not embarrassed by it
83:01 - because it's my old work everybody has
83:03 - their old work that they can improve one
83:05 - so let's see all right so thank you so
83:15 - much for joining me
83:17 - I'll be back like I said Wednesday not
83:20 - tomorrow so have a happy Halloween
83:21 - tomorrow and also let me know if anybody
83:27 - has any issues on github or once we do
83:29 - submit a pull request let me know
83:31 - because I need to submit one before the
83:33 - end of the day tomorrow
83:34 - so I'd love to help one of you all out
83:37 - instead of just finding some random repo
83:39 - somewhere so send me a message somewhere
83:42 - on Twitter or something and I'm happy to
83:46 - help
83:47 - all right cool I thanks John John says
83:50 - take care hope all goes well tomorrow
83:52 - thank you I do too hopefully if any of
83:56 - you are the praying type please play for
83:57 - my wife she's having a lot of a lot of
83:59 - health issues and we're trying to figure
84:01 - out what's wrong so hopefully we'll have
84:04 - some answers tomorrow it's my my button
84:09 - to stop the stream okay have a great day
84:12 - I'll be back on Wednesday

Cleaned transcript:

everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse today we're gonna keep working on that Salesforce form that's it's got a lot of a different stuff going on so it's in Salesforce but it's built by a company called Target X that was actually customized by a company called Jenzabar and really it was built with a combination of these visualforce apex components and angular so we got a lot going on here but today it's not that complicated because we're basically just doing CSS so we're gonna style this thing with CSS just an update on some of the other projects I have a new issue open in the react bulletin and I know the reactive Resource Center project because the head of my department uses Safari 9.1 on a Mac and the forms don't work so I did a little bit of research on it and some testing and I put some info on that issue so if anybody really likes trying to get older browsers to work with things then have at it otherwise I'm just going to keep working on it this week on our bulletin projects or react bulletin I've merged in two new pool requests so maybe we can go over those a little bit later on during the question and answer session if we have time I do have a meeting at 300 p.m. my time eastern time so that gives us an hour and a half till my meeting I would like to finish up in around an hour if possible to give me time to prep for my meeting but the meetings only about 20 feet away from where I'm sitting right now so it shouldn't take me that long to get there so if we go over at our 15 minutes that's fine too but sebastien and Harsha both submitted amazing pool requests so hopefully we have time to go over those otherwise you can check it out third thing I want to mention before we get started is that October fest is almost over so if you don't know what hack tober fest is let me just put this up briefly so you can check out Oktoberfest digitalocean comm you get a free tshirt if you sign up and then submit for pool requests before October 31st is over so I think you have today and tomorrow so check that out if you haven't already and if you haven't got your 4 and yet like me then check out some of the repos that we've been working on their stores some issues open and if you find something that I missed that needs work feel free to submit a pull request for that as well what I'd like to ask all of you is to let me know if there's something on one of your projects that you'd like for me to work on if there's something let me know either in the live chat or on Twitter or email or whatever social media you like if you can find my phone number you can call leave a message if you want but I just need to know the URL of your repository and what issue you you want me to fix so I've been looking for some good issues to use as my my fourth and final Oktoberfest pull request but I thought earlier today when I was looking through the list I thought you know what I would really much rather work on an issue that that you all need some help with since you all helped me so much with my projects I thought that would be cool so at least I want to give you all first dibs on my last PR and if I don't hear from any of you then I'll probably work on something tomorrow I will not be streaming tomorrow my wife has some testing that she needs to have done for some some health issues in the morning and so I'll be out all morning and I thought I don't really want to get ready and come into for a few hours in the afternoon if I could just work from home unfortunately as some of you already know my internet is not good enough at home to do a decent quality stream so I'll be off tomorrow so for those of you do be cell awaiting celebrating Halloween happy Halloween and I will be back Wednesday most likely unless something happens all right so enough enough with getting all of that out of the way okay not bad I only spent five minutes with the intro here so I've done worse all right so let's check out our Trello board first just to see what we were working on so for now we want to fix those button colors if you remember last week's stream the last stream on on Friday we're working with some weird things that were overriding our styles for our buttons and we tested out a few ways to make our styles override the the other styles that are in there and couldn't figure it out and I had said that I was going to try to look around and see if I could find something in Salesforce I ended up not having time to because the head of my department called me in to check out her computer because she couldn't submit anything through our Resource Center that we had launched last month at some point so I spent the rest of my day here trying to figure out what was wrong and then researching bugs for Safari 9 point I think it's nine point one so anyway I was not able to do what I wanted to do so I'm thinking for this string we may just have to resort to throwing in some importance and later on if I'm digging around in some files and I figure out where I can remove some of the styles that are currently being injected in there somewhere then we can always remove them later but if you'll notice there's two things we need to change just to in case you you weren't with us last week this blue shot this is actually a shadow underneath so we need our shadow to override that and then I do not want this button to transform like that and get shorter and wider other than that the button is not looking too bad so that's what we're going to work on first and then I think we'll probably switch over here to this side nap and we'll get this styled a little bit differently than it is now it's going to fit the university styles and we'll try to make it match as much as possible some of the the other side drawer side knives that we've been doing for our other sites all right so let's get to it let me move my timer somewhere up here let me put it up here now weights far away's I can get from my my face in the corner I won't cover it up like I normally do so I was doing a Pomodoro session before on another project so I'm just gonna restart that now and let's get over here to find our code I want to rearrange this order here there we go okay great so here's our app template we were putting our CSS in a separate file but I've given up on that it just added an extra step to the flow so I could always at some point just copy this style tag over into this file if I think it's useful so let me see I should have watched the last part of the stream on Friday I didn't have time and think about it to remind me of what we were editing I'm I'm pretty sure it wasn't that it would have been button styles which is down here there we go okay so we're already using important on the color let's try let's see alright let me see what's going on here with this transform first of all I want to see how they're doing this so that we can properly override it so which one this is the button correct it's interesting all right so we're gonna move this all the way over so that we can see our dev tools and our our button here okay yeah so that's what we want you want this one let's see what changes interesting all right so let's see trying to see any type of change happening here we could maybe check oops check the computed maybe we'll see it better there okay see nothing there let's yeah interesting okay with hmm I this is kind of odd I would kind of expect to see something changing right let's see and it since you seen so I just heard something beep on my computer I wanted to see what message I was getting do you ever have too many messenger things open at once and you you're not sure which one you're getting a message on that's that's how it is for me right now all right actually I haven't even checked the live chat at all yet let me let me check this and see if anyone has any ideas let me see okay I don't see anything yet also if you're new the way I do things is I wait until this 25 minute timer is up and then I go to the live chat and answer all your questions so please don't feel bad if I don't see or answer your question right away I will answer it on our question answer breaks or at the end of the stream I I stopped coding and I just go through the live chat and answer questions alright let's find out what this this is like the I think I mentioned last week I feel like a detective when I'm searching through some foreign CSS or this potentially could be some JavaScript stuff going on too but just searching through dev tools trying to figure out what's going on and how to how to change it that's that's a lot of what ends up happening when when I'm editing somebody else's stuff yes okay all right it's got to be this one I mean this has all the other styles there we go okay now I'm seeing something different well I don't know how I missed that before but uh here we have some hover some hover styles are those are styles and some of them yeah those are our styles let's see these are the styles that we're trying to override she's gotta be another hover style these are our styles again so the width isn't even you see in dev tools if you see a kind of grayed out a little bit then that's that's not directly getting the width from anything any styles on this particular component transitions it's not taking our borderradius too well let's do what we know we need to do we need to get that borderradius working in particular on this isn't even hover style let's go ahead and put it throw it important on that water radius and and see what else we need we can check let's take this hover off for a second just to see what else is being overwritten these are ours okay we could put important on our box shadow and just what I'm let's actually let's see how this looks now probably auto logged out of this yep I am okay to login login on another screen logs me out it's pretty fast log out for Salesforce I don't know if that's by default or if the admins for for my University set it like that just what we were working on no it wasn't that hmm all right I'm gonna have to go in and find I see it there it is all right so if you haven't seen us working on this the last three three streams this is not an ideal workflow of having to copy and paste things over but since I'm working in Salesforce this is what I have to work with right now I'm not aware of a different way to do it if there were some other way to integrate this better with my normal workflow I definitely would do that and fresh what's whoops forget a sign in here no I don't okay let's let me grab my password from the browser while I'm actually logged into my LastPass sorry about this I should have refreshed everything beforehand and got logged in oh okay not bad we still have that weird thing going on but at least we've taken care of everything else all right we just have to figure this up okay so let's see try turning off padding and hover say all right so we have some ideas here in the live chat about what to do let me read through these okay so John Hanson says some of the styles that are giving you problems may stem from higher up the Dom okay yeah I thought that but I didn't really check that much higher so I will double check that hard says check the padding okay cool I will check that and John says if the buttons inside a flex div its width will get determined by its alignment flex start okay let's let me check the padding first cuz I think that'll be the easiest thing to do since we're already on this component so let me go to computed and just see what padding we have 15 all around and now let's let's hover and let's check out the padding now oh yeah we have a different padding for sure okay cool let's switch it up bill 15 all around no matter what and see if that fixes it yep that looks good okay cool so we should be able to just set our padding hello I see I see what's happening it looks like our padding was being overridden on here but not when we did a hover okay that makes sense because when the the default CSS probably just put padding on the the button styles and then didn't bother putting it on the hover styles which you wouldn't normally do that that makes sense okay so this should fix it let's double check it and then we can move on to the next thing No all right we still have something else going on so it's no longer the padding because you see it's not it's not changing shape so we've solved one thing now is its line hide font size something like that let's see whoops however alright let's see make sure this is actually triggering it yep there we go alright so let's check our hover yeah let's check our computers who we have going on here trans okay so we have a text transform which should be fine because I think we are already doing that text size adjust where are we getting that from that's weird let's actually look to the font look bigger I think it does I think it might be the font size let me go back here and check our font size so we have font weights line Heights and font size that could probably all be okay so we have 14 here and that's not hovered I think hovered I think it was 16 right font 16 yeah alright so it looks like our font size is going from 14 to 16 I would like it to be 16 no matter what so let's add an important ear and this is the same thing that was happening with the padding right so the default styles have font size 14 so that was overriding our 16 but then it's hover state did not have a font size at all so our 16 was actually working so this should now work I thought earlier that the fontsize looked different but it was hard to tell with all the other things changing there we go perfect okay all right so check that out we've got a slight hover effect which I like much better than that what was happening before we're having just a huge change although now that I think about it it may not have had that large change by default we might have inadvertently caused that hover effect to happen by some of the styles that we had applied earlier before we even on this page so I think that that's that was probably the case all right let's get rid of this hover as well while we're here that's a hover we want to get rid of that color and the text decoration I think we already have a hover here yep so let's just put it in portent for these I want to give my disclaimer on using important so you've probably heard this before but just in case you don't normally want to use important if you're writing your own CSS for a project from scratch don't use important right because you have complete control you can just change how you have things set up and either through adding classes or changing the order in your CSS you should you should be able to make things work just through specificity and then keep everything cascading once you had important it breaks the Cascade so it doesn't matter like right now this is just an a right it's not specific at all I mean I guess we have an ahover in here right but somebody can make this super specific and put like HTML body div and it would still be overridden by this because we put important there so you see how it breaks somebody could put inline Styles on a specific a zag and it would still be broken and and overridden by this important so we're only using it in this case because we don't have access or control of much of what's going on in terms of the markup and what's going on in terms of the other styles that are being added to the page in various places so in this case we're stuck with important is one of our last options and that's what it should always be a last option all right I'm not even going to test that because that's very simple it should definitely work now let me check how much time we have okay so it's almost up for that session let's add in that extra Pomodoro session and Mark that is done and let's go inside of let's just go ahead and or next time one we'll do it we'll change the colors and as a part of that we'll probably do these together we're gonna change the indicator colors as well okay I'll be able to pull this over goodness I've got really what um wait how did we get it did we get logged out again it's possible I accidentally hit sign out when I was mousing over it okay let me grab my password again okay all right so we're logged in again and all we need to see now is the sidebar and my sessions almost up so I'm just gonna go ahead and break now do five minutes in the live chat so I'll be starting at the top and just working my way down answering as many questions as I can that's okay horseshit asked if I'd seen PR 54 which by now I've already said it I have seen its merch now Arshad says I saw an inspirational for loop so if if y'all can see this in the live chat will probably make more sense but for age equals 0 a when age is greater than or if age is greater than or equal to life dot length knowledge plus plus that's cool I like that okay so John Hanson says please implement styled components you will save yourself a lot of grief you can use an imported theme as a wrapper and still be able to cleanly style components as standalone components okay yeah and hard shipments and styled components are specific to react yeah so I mean obviously we can't use them with Salesforce but we can start using them on our other react projects okay haha Irish it says that button took a long time to debug yes it did John Hanson says I usually shed it's here if I'm forced to use important yeah it feels a little bit like giving up like oh yeah yeah there's got to be a better way but I just don't want to do it so let's just put important in there yeah I I find myself using important a lot less than I used to today I probably used an important so far in the half hour we've been streaming I've used important more than I've probably used it in the last month or two I it depends on the project though if it's something like this where I have to deal with already existing code I tend to use it a lot more alright all right I think I actually there's not that much in the live chat so I think I've gotten to the bottom of it so that's cool so I shouldn't go over my time here Harshit says she checked NXT shared CEO Diane her was that the one that you built the chat thing yeah okay cool yeah I definitely check that out that is really cool so if you haven't already checked it out harsh I built this really cool chat site and it's NXT share dot Co dot I n so yeah it was really cool I checked that out Friday that's Friday yeah I was really impressed by that all right well since I'm out of stuff on the live chat I may as well start the next next session so yeah let's get started on this so if you ask anything after this point I will get through it after this next session this will be our last code session and then we'll just do all questionandanswer and I got a question in there right at the end says how's the weather today it's a little bit cold and rainy where I'm at it's about 40 degrees it was in the upper 30s this morning but I think it's in the mid 40s now and it's it's rainy so it's appropriate weather for this time of year all right I actually don't mind that 40s or 50s and rain I think it's kind of nice I'm not sure why but boys I've always liked it when it's dark outside and about 50 degrees and slightly raining I don't know if I would say it's my favorite but it's pretty close to it okay I'm just playing around a little bit just to think about what colors I want here we will probably end up going with a lot of white like we normally do now I'm thinking about how far I want to take this now let's let's see first we'll stick with the colors but just to let you know what I'm thinking right now I'm wondering how far could we change this to look like what we normally do I I do kind of like that it has this year that's that that's not bad that's a nice indicator so I don't want to change that but whenever it is actually open I think it might be nicer if it did look closer to what we normally do well we'll see once we get in here and see some of the markup it'll be pretty obvious how difficult it would be to try to make this look exactly like our other side now sir as close as possible oops and actually we forgot to change this color too did was that on another one change I'll change the icon colors as another another to do so I wondered why I didn't didn't do that one all right so let's change the background color first and we'll have to change the font color as well because we won't be able to read anything so let's go up so we get the container div where the color supplied there we go yep that's where the colors applied so let's switch that up all right let's go with white and let's see I'm gonna make this whoops black wanna make that I'm gonna have to go down lower okay well at first we can at least put this background color on target apps next application sidebar this for really change when not expand it yeah we want to put it on that base style so it applies to both forms of the sidebar okay so si bar let's put this below the nav bar and put it right in here and sidebar and okay and then let's see where the colors up being applied color that's weird to share it again oh okay inherit all right and see that's the first time okay on so we're gonna have to do an h1 and then let's go down to the vowels and then a okay h2 why well would you have an h2 inside of an a tag inside of an li anyway I can I kind of see what they're doing here but really it wouldn't it be better to just leave the headers as this and not have them repeated as H tags I gotta check this now because if these aren't H tags then I'm gonna be upset okay at least they are H tags okay so I have enough to do this where we add sidebar okay so let's go target X application sidebar oops and we want to get the H ones and then sidebar h2s and the color let me grab me grab our dark color from somewhere else hmm I don't see it let's just make it I'm always I never want to type out the rgba colors by my myself I just I always want to do it like this I don't know why a father would have been faster in that case you just type it out myself all right now let's put this here and I do want to see what this looks like before we go on okay well some of what we did worked and some did not so we may just have to put important on that and move on let's check it out for a second yeah yeah same same reason it was being overridden with our button styles so oh they're okay we actually need to change the font as well so it's good to know all right so let's add and pour it here and let's go up and grab our font and actually let's try to do it important up here I don't think there's anywhere where we wouldn't want to use this font so John Hanson I just saw your your comment had the little devil emoji with important oh there we go all right yeah it works okay well not for everything so our h1 it did not work that's wait a second displaynone why do we have oh this is weird our button color is now not working all right let's move this button color back to testing and we'll look at that in a little bit but right now this is what we're working on so in each one did we not have text there am i looking at the wrong element maybe I'm looking the wrong thing I am sorry about that I was looking at the wrong place okay and this is not an h1 it's a span so let's change this first of all let's make sure they're not setting the color they are okay but they're setting it on this so we should be fine to put that here and these are yeah let's go ahead and just do both of these now actually we're not gonna you're not gonna want to do them together we want them to be different colors but I'll just copy them copy the classes over okay uh I didn't copy okay let's try this again I'll get the right stuff yeah and let's see let's try to nest this and see if we can override things through nesting well it's not really necessary I'm thinking in sass terms like normally I would nest this is that's not really what you would say and CSS alright so for this we're gonna go with that green color that Franciscan University green and for this one we'll use this same color that we have up here which actually if we're going to do that we should just do it here okay really we're gonna have to use important oh that's why backgroundcolor sector certification backgroundcolor that's why and then for this that's just putting Fortin here I'm not sure how many more videos we'll have on this I I wanted to do enough videos to be able to make a playlist out of this that would be reasonable so we're at four videos for this this may be the last one I may do one more I don't really want to spend a ton of time I haven't really been getting a lot of views for this kind of thing so I just don't think there's that many people that are interested and this kind of stuff I think there's more interest in the react stuff that we've been doing so I'd like to switch back I didn't really want to just stop right in the middle of it I'd like to get it to some point of completion before we stop that's okay not bad I mean color wise it's that we can at least see everything now I really don't know about this this change here I mean I don't I don't mind this crossing to make it an X but I don't really like this size change so I think I want to get rid of that so let me add that as another to do that falls outside of our scope of changing colors is it a hover effect as an AFF ECT or a hover effect like EF Fe CT I can never remember I always ask my wife because she's an English teacher and she actually teaches English at the college that I work at and she always knows okay and we've changed the colors for the side nav I guess the one thing we could change the colors of these dividers do we want actually a masseuse do we even want to have those dividers there anymore is that necessary we don't normally do dividers between every menu item do we like let's check we don't want to hear no we don't we have them between different you know categories of not in this sense but like different sections of our menu but this isn't necessarily a different section these these all play the same role you know for now I'm not gonna do anything with them what I probably wouldn't add is you know this this hover behind let's do that let's let's add a hover behind now this is where it might get a little weird are we even going to be able to do that same hover because you know where did where is this extent oh actually we need a we need a shadow on this as well this looks really weird so we need a shadow and we can we can definitely shorten this there's no reason that it has to be that long so let's add these and we're going to okay and let me we want to change this color there we go I like that better and yeah let me we do have shadows on here correct no we don't we know we don't have a shadow let's let's find one where we we bring that out so okay all right so maybe we don't have a shadow normally but it just graze everything out so we have this overlay but in this case we don't really want the overlay right because you can I don't know it does automatically close okay well then we probably should add an overlay this will do what will either hover or overlay I don't want to do the border because you can see we really only do the border if we have it fixed let's let's shrink this up don't see what we actually have on yeah we don't have the border or at least it's not obvious but that there is a border there yeah so let's let's keep stick with that and so that's what we'll do so we'll either do an overlay or a shadow actually you know what we're gonna add a shadow' no matter what because when it's no I'm gonna do that hey we got back to that screen I don't know if you remember but I think of the first day we worked on this we got to this screen and it looked terrible and I didn't I couldn't figure out how to get back to it okay that's cool well now we know how to get back to it I just have to hit this button okay so we'll need something here maybe here this would be a good place to have a border I may have to think about this so we're gonna add maybe add the shadow here I'll just add some notes maybe an overlay we're closed okay all right so I have to mess around with a couple of these couple options that we have here and that's about it for this so let's um let's see colors yeah so we've we've changed the colors I think we're safe to mark that off where we don't really need to do anything else with colors for the side now and yep all right not bad so we only got two to do stun but we came in well with the exception in this one where it took twice as long as we thought the colors were right on target in terms of time so not bad I may have to just end up by default putting important on everything because it seems like no matter how much I try to not have to use important I have to use it on almost every element so our new strategy might just be use important oh man and I just got a message on slack that there is food in the kitchen free food so I definitely have to end this before my meeting so that I can stop in and get free food I have one of my coworkers always lets me know if there's free food so I joke with her and say that's actually in a job description that she has to do that but I appreciate it she knows how much I enjoy free food that's kind of pretty much the the one benefit I can see the coming into work instead of working from home that I would miss it's getting the free food that is frequently here at work okay let me scroll up and now at this point I'm gonna do Question and Answer so if you have any questions please put them in the live chat now even if you don't have a question appreciate it if you if you can if you'd stick around and help answer some of the questions because I certainly don't have all the answers to everything and I appreciate having different opinions on things as well but if you got to take off thanks for watching I should be back on Wednesday and I will not be back tomorrow but if you need to send me a message or something on social media or whatever I'll I'll be online I'll just be working from home okay let's trying to find where I left off okay sciences go bucs yeah oh okay harsh it says will you be running post CSS autoprefixer at the end of your CSS that's a great idea I actually I really like to run that but normally I have it set up to run automatically and in this case we don't have any type of build tools running so I probably would have forgot about that if you hadn't mentioned it so thank you so let's autoprefixer awesome thank you Harshit that is a wonderful idea okay John says I think most builds include post CSS though when you do dev tools in the browser much of what is added gets crossed out anyhow yeah let's see Anna says what's the hardest you've ever worth I think maybe I'll give two answers from that one will be code related and one non code related so I worked well actually some of you all may remember when it was right around the time to launch the catechetical Institute website which was project one that we worked on I worked some crazy hours for at least the last two weeks of that project I worked almost double my normal amount of hours so we're talking like 70 to 80 hours a week that was pretty crazy I think I worked for like 14 hours one day that was wild I think I streamed for five hours one day I think I streamed and then took a break and it streamed again so that was pretty crazy I have done I've done like and where I've worked pretty much all day and then as late as I could stay up at night went to sleep for couple hours woke up again and started working on a project so in terms of code that's the hardest just trying to put out as much code as I possibly can and stay up as late as I can but in terms of in general how what's the hardest I've ever worked I don't know I've had some jobs that were that were tough physically I used to work for for a city in West Virginia called Weirton so I worked for the city of Wooten which that's the city I grew up in and I did that for about six years but it was on it was seasonal so I didn't always they didn't have enough for me to do during the wintertime usually but that job was a lot of like eight hours a day pushing a lawn mower doing maintenance work generally like lifting things working on whatever needed fixed whatever needed cleaned so like that was somewhat physically demanding is like you're just on your feet every day that matter how hot it is how cold it is like you're working so but I was young I mean this was when I was a teenager and so it it wasn't that bad then I think back to it now I think man I'd be sore if I tried to do that now that was tough and I'll tell you what I used to be a manager an assistant manager at a Burger King restaurant it's a fastfood restaurant that was really tough because that would work these shifts and sometimes I'd work ten hours straight and we'd be so busy that I just couldn't stop like I literally could not take a minute break because we always had people in there and we are always understaffed so I couldn't just manage it was like you're making sandwiches you got a headset on you're taking orders you're running the cash register all at the same time that you're trying to make sure everybody else was doing their job that was wild that was just like exhausting and you work a shift like that and close up and like on the weekend you'd close up at 200 a.m. during the week you close up at midnight and then if you work the next shift the next stiff shift started at 400 a.m. so you couldn't get full amount of sleep so anyway I'm sure y'all don't care about how to manage a fastfood restaurant but that was that was really wild just in terms of like working that much without a break all right let's see how cool John Hanson said time for dictionary.com to see how that affects or affects things okay John says the the hover behind sounds good so we're talking about on a hover behind these items I'd also add a shadow' to help define its needed for the Seidman yeah it's definitely needed now that it's the same color I mean I could see why they didn't have it before it wasn't exactly necessary the shadow could just show when the side I was out yeah that's true I mean really I guess when you think about like in terms of material design of everything's on like a different level the side nav is actually on a higher level unless I'm remembering this wrong the side nav is on a higher level than the the paper like the you know the normal level so be like Niazi zero right if we're thinking zindex so it would make sense that there would be a shadow no matter what since since we have the partially open state and the open fully open state we don't really have a closed state so if there should be a shadow yeah okay we have this sub I guess we can keep this sub header here I'm not a huge fan because you all know I don't really like thick headers and this makes it really thick but yeah I mean this side nav realistically should probably be at the same level I'm gonna have to doublecheck the material design Docs to make sure that the app bar which is what this is called in the in the docs and the side drawer I think it's called side drawer are supposed to be at the same level of the zindex level so I shouldn't say see index I don't want you to get confused with CSSA index I mean that the Z height level surface was XYZ coordinates right we have our x and y coordinate is it is X this way yeah I think X Y trying to remember back to high school math class and then your Z coordinate would be like depth right or height however you want to think about it so that's what I'm talking about oh cool innocence thanks for the stream you're welcome thank you so much for watching and for asking questions in the in the live chat I appreciate it alright John Hansen says react equals mystery I figured how this array dot fine and change state to the array but to use the new array as a parameter and then using this state state dot arrayed key value is confusing that sounds confusing reading it I probably I'd have to think about that you see the code to understand really understand that there are some weird confusing things about react I really like react but I've definitely been confused at times and thought what why isn't this working so usually whenever it finally works it makes sense why it works and why it didn't work the other way but getting to that point of realizing what the right way to do it is is can be a challenge sometimes luckily I have you all to let me know and it usually doesn't take that long when when you're watching to let me know what the right way is but it can definitely take a while sometimes let's see Rohini says hello from India hey how's it going thanks for watching from India I know it's late what is it well 45 right in the morning right now or at night however you want to think about it John answer says it works and it is logical to react but Wow yeah yeah that's what what is this angle I seen this on different social media but it's stuff like react makes complicated things simple and simple things complicated some something like that yeah but that's I would agree with that statement right there's just there's some things that I used to do with jQuery you know back when back a year ago when I used to be into jQuery I don't wanna don't to make it sound like it's been that long time but you do so much a query it would be the simplest thing in the world just so easy and then with react it's like how can I do this exact same thing and it seems so much more complex but some things are really easy with reactant and I remember that them being just super difficult with jQuery and I just had all the spaghetti code when I tried to do it so for me at least the the transition from jQuery based stuff to react stuff has had more benefits than drawbacks it definitely took me longer to build the same fun action ality when I first started but I think now I'm at the level where I faster with reacts not only that but everything's more reliable with react and I think it's a heck of a lot easier to other people for other people to read the code and contribute to it I still like dread going back to some of my old applications that I built with with jQuery so like we've read on it like the Resource Center that we redid in react I'm so glad that I never have to go back to the original and look at it again I didn't delete the code it's it's still on git and github as a private room faucet honey I'll probably never make it public but anyway and then now the bulletin that we're working on when that finally launches then the I won't have to look back at the other code and that will the jQuery version will also remain a Friday treat actually I don't really care if you all would look at that if you really wanted to I make it public but the only thing I'm worried about is making sure I don't have any any keys or anything that I shouldn't have in there because since it was a private repo I never bothered removing any keys so I'd have to double check on that okay John says it sounds LOL sounds like my thoughts on jquery yes it's a different hat one has to wear even from JavaScript yeah for sure alright John says love to see it alright cool I'll have to yeah I'll see about making it public I'm pretty sure the Resource Center one I can make public I think the only like keys that I had was the I was storing data in Google sheets so I had like the URL to store things in a Google sheet but I'm no longer using those sheets so I can just shut it off so that you can't use that anymore and that that should be fine the the bullets in one we'll see yeah aha I may have to do some things before I can make the bullets in one public we may have to may I be after I launch the newer version of it the react version but I'm pretty sure I could also make that public as well so so you can see it it might off to doublecheck everything but I'm pretty sure I will be able to make in public all right almost to the bottom of the live shot here Blake says I'm working on like three projects what do I do I want to do them all at the same time well I'm kind of in the same situation right now so I have this project we're still working on the bulletin and I'm trying to sort out some bugs on the Resource Center I just finished up that react native projects for the Udacity nano degree which I'm still going to make that video for the nanodegree I have not forgotten about that so yeah so anyway when I have lots of projects to do I make sure that I take notes so I don't get confused and I do i do Trello boards and I make sure I write down notes on the cards so I can jump back and forth I have a lot more windows open on my on my computer when it's like that but it's definitely doable it also helps if the projects are somewhat related then it's nice because you can use what you learn on one project on the other project it's kind of like like when I was in college it was nice when I took classes that overlapped in content so that you've already learned it in one class and then maybe a few weeks later you're tested on it in another class and so it's like you don't really have to spend as much work because because you took the classes at the same time you're learning the same material and it cuts down on the amount of time you have to study projects are the same if you can do similar projects at the same time you can just recycle code from one project to another and complete both of the projects faster than it would take you if you only did one so it can work it can definitely be more beneficial to work on multiple things at once it just depends on what projects they are oh cool so Rohini says visiting this channel after three months dude super cool series of tutorials from free code camp excellent job guys mission target frontend JavaScript and design Jessie will watch all your tutorials ah that's that's awesome that's really awesome I'm glad you glad you like it I think we've come a long way in the last in the last three months I think I certainly have come a long way with with all of your help in my understanding of react and I think maybe it like into my skills as a live streamer I don't know you all let me know but I feel like I'm able to better balance questions in code now for a while there I would get off track way too easily and I feel sorry for everybody that was watching those earlier streams but I think we got a decent system now and it seems seems to be working I get less complaints that I talk too much now I use I used to get comments on the videos and in the live chat like stop talking more code which I thought was funny and I agreed with okay and after saying that it really is time for me to stop talking because I have six minutes before my meeting starts so let me hurry up and see the last few things that were in here to see Jessie please upload previous tutorials on github trying to think I think everything that we've done in the videos is on github so some of the stuff that I'll upload stuff that I've done but I haven't done videos on it so you can certainly check it out and ask me questions about it if you want but some of my earlier stuff will be better examples of what not to do and what to do because we've since you know learn better ways to do it or at least I've learned better ways to do it so but I still will put them up there as well I'm not I'm not embarrassed by it because it's my old work everybody has their old work that they can improve one so let's see all right so thank you so much for joining me I'll be back like I said Wednesday not tomorrow so have a happy Halloween tomorrow and also let me know if anybody has any issues on github or once we do submit a pull request let me know because I need to submit one before the end of the day tomorrow so I'd love to help one of you all out instead of just finding some random repo somewhere so send me a message somewhere on Twitter or something and I'm happy to help all right cool I thanks John John says take care hope all goes well tomorrow thank you I do too hopefully if any of you are the praying type please play for my wife she's having a lot of a lot of health issues and we're trying to figure out what's wrong so hopefully we'll have some answers tomorrow it's my my button to stop the stream okay have a great day I'll be back on Wednesday
