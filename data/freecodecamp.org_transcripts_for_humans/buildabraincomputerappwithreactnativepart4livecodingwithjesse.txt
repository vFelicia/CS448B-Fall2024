00:04 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:06 - with jesse i'm jesse and today we're
00:09 - going to keep working on our brain
00:11 - computer app
00:13 - we have
00:14 - all of our
00:15 - phase one functionality working
00:18 - but it doesn't look very good so we need
00:20 - to
00:22 - style it a little bit just make it look
00:24 - a little bit nicer it doesn't have to be
00:26 - like amazing right
00:28 - but uh we want to look a little bit
00:30 - better and if we get through that today
00:32 - then we're gonna do
00:35 - whatever else we need to do to get it
00:36 - ready to actually go to
00:38 - the google play store we're gonna launch
00:40 - this first as an android app later on on
00:43 - ios i happen to have an android phone so
00:45 - that's why i'm doing android first
00:48 - and i'm on a pc
00:50 - so
00:52 - i i do have a mac that i can use to
00:56 - launch this as an ios app as well but
00:59 - it's not as good for streaming so we're
01:01 - going to try this first
01:02 - as an android app since the last time we
01:05 - streamed i did install
01:07 - uh android studio so we can simulate
01:11 - the android app
01:13 - right now i'm just going to stay in the
01:15 - the web mode
01:16 - because it's easier to work with when
01:18 - we're styling but at some point when we
01:20 - need to we can also check out the
01:23 - the simulator
01:25 - in android studio okay so see there's a
01:28 - lot of you here and a lot of you been
01:30 - waiting for a long time i noticed a few
01:32 - you uh are in time zones to where it's
01:36 - like
01:38 - i don't know 2 am 3 a.m something like
01:40 - that i apologize for that
01:42 - i um
01:44 - i used to be able to stream earlier in
01:46 - the day to accommodate time zones
01:48 - especially time zones like if you're in
01:50 - india or or you know time zones in that
01:53 - area uh but unfortunately i have to work
01:56 - during that time period now so
01:58 - uh it's kind of hard for me to
02:00 - accommodate i guess if i waited till
02:02 - even later like towards night time here
02:05 - in my time zone uh i it would be maybe
02:08 - morning
02:09 - there's just not really a time that i
02:11 - can stream that would accommodate all
02:13 - time zones so
02:14 - uh let me know if this is a very awkward
02:17 - time for you and i'll keep that in mind
02:19 - uh but
02:20 - um i guess probably the best thing for
02:23 - me to do maybe is just try to
02:25 - do different times when i can
02:28 - so that you can always watch the
02:29 - recording
02:31 - but
02:32 - you know maybe sometimes you can catch
02:33 - it live if i switch up the times one
02:36 - other thing i wanted to
02:38 - to tell you all before we get started
02:40 - with the code
02:41 - you may have noticed that part two is no
02:44 - longer available so this is part four of
02:47 - a streaming series part two is not
02:49 - available
02:50 - uh so
02:52 - after trying to figure out what happened
02:54 - to part two my best guess as to what
02:56 - happened is that i accidentally deleted
02:58 - it
02:59 - so i'm very sorry about that
03:03 - i'm not
03:04 - i don't really remember deleting it for
03:07 - sure but what i do remember is that
03:09 - before the last stream like right before
03:11 - the last stream i was trying to set the
03:13 - stream up and i accidentally created the
03:16 - stream
03:17 - with
03:19 - basically like no scheduled start time
03:21 - which means the stream would be
03:23 - scheduled to start immediately
03:25 - and then i quickly realized my mistake
03:28 - and started a new stream
03:30 - uh tried to start a new stream with the
03:32 - same name that would have the correct
03:34 - start time
03:36 - and i wanted to quit that old stream
03:38 - basically delete the old stream so i
03:41 - wouldn't confuse people who were
03:42 - thinking that it would start immediately
03:45 - and um
03:47 - what i think happened is that i thought
03:50 - i was deleting that that stream that
03:52 - should have never been created but in
03:54 - reality i maybe deleted the wrong stream
03:57 - and i deleted the second one
03:59 - that's what i think happened
04:01 - and the reason i think that is because
04:03 - after i finished that stream which is
04:05 - stream three i went back and saw that
04:07 - the duplicative stream three was still
04:09 - there
04:10 - and it had never been deleted
04:12 - and um so i'm thinking maybe that's what
04:15 - happened
04:16 - i tried to contact youtube through the
04:18 - feedback
04:19 - like their feedback modal on um
04:22 - like creator studio is like the youtube
04:24 - um kind of like admin panel for um for
04:28 - creators
04:29 - i tried sending a message there
04:31 - i don't really know if they'll get
04:33 - around
04:34 - i don't know if they even
04:36 - would
04:37 - um
04:40 - put
04:40 - like recreate that video i know it's
04:43 - possible i've read online that it
04:45 - happened sometimes that they will
04:46 - recreate the video
04:48 - uh but i'm not 100 sure like free
04:50 - codecamp doesn't monetize so i don't
04:52 - know
04:53 - i don't know how google would view that
04:54 - if it would you know i've heard that
04:56 - they do it for large channels this is
04:58 - kind of a large channel but
05:00 - i don't know so we'll see i'm kind of
05:02 - expecting that that video will never
05:03 - come back so i really apologize for that
05:06 - um
05:08 - i mean i like
05:10 - i i tried to read everything i could and
05:12 - do whatever i could to try to get it
05:13 - back but
05:15 - it's i think it's out of my hands at
05:16 - this time so
05:18 - anyway
05:19 - uh that's what happened to number two i
05:21 - did have a few people ask about it so i
05:23 - figured i'd just you know let everybody
05:25 - know
05:26 - so let's go ahead and uh and get started
05:31 - and
05:34 - like i said we're gonna do some styling
05:36 - we may also add in
05:38 - maybe clean up the code a little bit if
05:40 - i notice somewhere where we could clean
05:42 - it up
05:43 - it's still very simple though we've
05:45 - managed to do everything all in one file
05:50 - but we do have some places where you
05:52 - know for instance
05:53 - we still have some commented out code
05:56 - you know this if statement is kind of
05:57 - pointless right since we're not doing
05:59 - anything else so
06:01 - a few places where we could clean things
06:03 - up
06:04 - you know i'd rather not ship unnecessary
06:08 - code if i don't have to so we'll be on
06:10 - the lookout for that
06:13 - but for now we want to do some styling
06:15 - which we basically did you know very
06:17 - very little styling
06:20 - you know up it to this point i don't
06:21 - even know if we have an object for
06:23 - styles no we don't
06:25 - okay
06:26 - let's do that first let's make that so
06:28 - in react native
06:30 - let me set my timer as well so
06:33 - i'm gonna set a timer for 25 minutes
06:36 - and
06:38 - i'll do code for 25 minutes
06:41 - and then
06:43 - when the timer goes off i'll go back to
06:45 - the live chat i'll answer some questions
06:47 - as many as i can get to and in a five
06:49 - minute time period and then we'll do a
06:51 - little bit more code
06:53 - all right so
06:54 - okay we we did import style sheets so
06:56 - maybe we have it somewhere i just don't
06:58 - know where are we using style sheets
07:00 - there we go
07:03 - i'm just gonna mix in there with
07:04 - everything else
07:06 - so
07:07 - when you're doing react native it's uh
07:09 - it's a good idea to use
07:11 - this stylesheet.create and to put your
07:14 - styles in here
07:15 - it helps
07:16 - as far as i know
07:18 - with what react native does behind the
07:20 - scenes it helps with performance
07:22 - so let's let's move our styles into
07:26 - our
07:28 - stylesheet.create
07:29 - object
07:31 - and
07:32 - then we'll we'll go from there
07:34 - so that'll clean things up a little bit
07:36 - get our styles all
07:37 - in the same spot
07:39 - so
07:41 - if i take this so this would be our
07:44 - our inputs it looks like all our inputs
07:46 - have the same
07:49 - the same styling
07:51 - so i should be able to select all of
07:53 - them yep
07:54 - and let's get rid of them and
07:57 - let's say
07:58 - style equals styles
08:02 - dot
08:03 - input
08:05 - and then up here in our style object
08:09 - let's create a key called input
08:14 - whoa
08:15 - didn't not mean for that to happen all
08:17 - right
08:19 - input
08:21 - and then let's paste oops
08:24 - i wondered if that was gonna happen
08:26 - since i i cut all of them but let's
08:28 - paste our styles into here okay now
08:31 - what we should get is
08:35 - our
08:36 - and let's log out so we can actually see
08:38 - this
08:39 - let's see if it'll there we go
08:43 - so see these now have the same styles
08:46 - and we cleaned up
08:48 - a decent amount of code here
08:50 - because we just move this into styles
08:52 - this works just like a normal style
08:54 - sheet with a few differences so
08:57 - a normal style sheet
08:59 - uses css syntax right this is javascript
09:03 - object syntax so you notice we don't
09:05 - have
09:06 - hyphenated uh properties here they're
09:10 - camel case so if you take your normal
09:11 - css properties and camel case them then
09:13 - they'll work
09:15 - and
09:19 - also we have no uh values
09:23 - in react native so there's no pixels at
09:25 - the end it's just straight numbers
09:28 - okay anything else is a string
09:31 - and we can also throw javascript in here
09:34 - which is is a pretty cool feature
09:38 - and then by default everything is in
09:40 - flexbox in react native and the flex
09:43 - direction by default is column
09:46 - whereas uh normally in on the web the
09:50 - default flex direction is row
09:52 - those are the main differences
09:54 - now
09:55 - react native uses a subset of css
09:59 - which means that
10:02 - you can't use all of what's available in
10:05 - css in react native but most of it's
10:08 - still available
10:09 - so if you if you try to do something
10:11 - that's not available you'll get a
10:13 - message in
10:15 - you know in your browser depending on
10:17 - what you're using
10:18 - uh whether a browser or
10:20 - uh an emulator or testing on a device at
10:23 - some point you'll get some warning to
10:25 - say that you know this one doesn't work
10:27 - at the very least you'll see on the
10:29 - screen that it doesn't work right so
10:33 - for now
10:34 - uh i think everything we're trying to do
10:36 - will definitely work okay so let's look
10:40 - through the rest of our app just to make
10:41 - sure we didn't miss anything no we
10:43 - didn't miss anything so
10:45 - right now let's add some styling to our
10:50 - our links here or i'm sorry our inputs
10:52 - here
10:53 - um the inputs are
10:55 - really close together
10:56 - which looks kind of weird so let's add a
10:59 - little little space between these so
11:02 - i'm gonna add uh
11:04 - let's add some
11:07 - margin
11:10 - and i'm gonna do margin vertical this is
11:13 - a little different you don't see this
11:14 - too often in css
11:16 - but in in react native with our style
11:18 - sheet we can say margin vertical and
11:20 - let's just give it an 8
11:22 - and see how that looks
11:25 - now what this will do is
11:27 - margin vertical will add a margin on the
11:29 - top and the bottom at the same time
11:32 - so
11:34 - we end up with
11:36 - in between inputs here we end up with
11:38 - actually 16 pixels
11:40 - or
11:41 - 16 units right of
11:43 - uh margin
11:45 - and then at the bottom here we have
11:46 - eight so i don't
11:53 - sorry if it uh
11:55 - there's a little bit of a delay on the
11:57 - stream my computer's been doing this
11:58 - weird thing
11:59 - lately where every once in a while like
12:02 - i can hear my music like slows down
12:04 - and if i'm recording a video or
12:06 - streaming it just like stops
12:09 - for a second or two uh i haven't been
12:11 - able to figure out what's doing it yet
12:13 - um
12:15 - hopefully i can just maybe try restart
12:17 - and that'll fix the problem
12:20 - all right so i don't really like that
12:22 - much
12:23 - that much padding and to be honest with
12:25 - you let's uh
12:28 - let's give this a little mobile mobile
12:30 - view here so
12:32 - let's try to imitate a mobile view
12:36 - and
12:37 - see if we can get a
12:39 - right now it's showing this i wonder
12:46 - at device type
12:51 - all right cool so we can kind of see you
12:53 - know how this would look
12:55 - on a mobile device
12:57 - it's actually looks super small i think
12:59 - we can definitely make this stuff bigger
13:02 - wonder why why did it look so small uh
13:05 - did we have it on
13:08 - oh because i had it zoomed in a lot
13:12 - that's why
13:15 - so uh i definitely gonna take the zoom
13:17 - off of that
13:18 - at least on the on the desktop or the uh
13:21 - web version
13:24 - i don't know and my uh my timer stopped
13:28 - that's interesting
13:29 - i wonder if my
13:31 - stream freezing and my timer stopping or
13:33 - have anything to do with each other
13:35 - i guess i'll have to keep an eye on the
13:37 - clock now
13:38 - at about 5 30 eastern time or about a
13:42 - half hour into the stream
13:44 - i'm gonna take a break
13:46 - and go to the uh go to the chat
13:52 - all right so let's uh let's make these a
13:54 - little bit bigger
13:56 - well i want to make
13:58 - let's make the text bigger as well
14:00 - uh which i don't think we have any
14:02 - styles on the on the text so
14:05 - let's make
14:06 - [Music]
14:09 - style equals and let's say
14:17 - styles dot
14:20 - whoops
14:25 - heading
14:26 - i've been typing on a different keyboard
14:28 - all day for work so now i'm
14:30 - uh
14:34 - keep mistyping everything
14:36 - so we're gonna do for our our text
14:40 - we're gonna have the styles.heading oops
14:42 - nope
14:49 - [Music]
14:52 - and let's give this a font size
14:56 - of i don't know let's say 24 let's just
15:00 - see what that how that looks
15:06 - right all right a little bit bigger not
15:08 - too bad
15:09 - and um
15:14 - i kind of you know i want this to be
15:18 - kind of stand out a little bit more so
15:19 - let's do
15:21 - margin
15:22 - bottom
15:24 - uh we'll we'll give this a 16 for margin
15:27 - bottom oops forgot my
15:30 - comma see what that looks like
15:33 - okay a little bit better
15:38 - all right not bad
15:40 - and actually with more space there the
15:42 - spacing on these inputs doesn't look
15:44 - quite as bad
15:46 - uh also our inputs are
15:50 - you know i think they could definitely
15:52 - be wider like right now you can't even
15:54 - see
15:55 - uh all the content i wonder what would
15:58 - happen if we just comment out
16:00 - the width
16:02 - would it go full width
16:04 - okay
16:05 - it's it looks like maybe it's it's
16:08 - defaulting to some sort of you know
16:10 - preset width
16:15 - i guess i'm okay with that to be honest
16:17 - with you though i mean i think we could
16:19 - go
16:20 - like there's quite a bit of white space
16:22 - here
16:24 - we may want to you know go a little bit
16:26 - wider
16:27 - uh especially because the device id is
16:30 - is so large
16:31 - uh there may not really be a way to fit
16:33 - it in there but yeah actually if we went
16:35 - just a little bit wider i think it would
16:37 - it would work
16:38 - uh so
16:41 - let's figure out why it's getting this
16:43 - width
16:44 - and i'm gonna
16:46 - we don't need much space for the preview
16:49 - all right and i'm going to look over
16:51 - here
16:52 - let me make this just a bit smaller
16:54 - sorry if it makes it harder to see
16:56 - but
16:58 - i want to see what kind of styles we're
17:00 - getting here
17:02 - and if we go over to computed so if we
17:04 - look here
17:05 - and inspect
17:07 - the input right we're so we're on the
17:09 - input
17:12 - and
17:13 - if we go to computed we could scroll
17:15 - down it's in alphabetical order and we
17:17 - can go to with
17:19 - and see like all right actually when
17:21 - it's grayed out like this this doesn't
17:23 - mean that there
17:24 - so i want to make sure you can see it
17:25 - yeah you can see it i was afraid my my
17:27 - face was covering it up
17:29 - when it's grayed out like this
17:31 - it means that there's no width directly
17:33 - applied to that so i'm i'm guessing that
17:37 - this is just taking up the full space of
17:39 - its container
17:40 - so let's check the container
17:42 - [Music]
17:44 - maybe not
17:48 - [Music]
17:50 - so where
17:52 - [Music]
17:57 - it's
17:58 - interesting maybe
18:02 - maybe we'll get lucky and just find it
18:04 - in here
18:09 - [Music]
18:16 - i'm not sure it's just it's an odd
18:18 - number to default to right what was it
18:20 - defaulting to 152.
18:22 - yeah so that is odd and we can see
18:24 - there's not really
18:26 - it's not like the container is
18:29 - forcing it
18:31 - to be there this is the container
18:33 - right so
18:36 - the container is much bigger
18:43 - let's see
18:44 - let's see what we can do
18:46 - uh let's see if we can do some flexbox
18:49 - stuff here so if we do flex
18:52 - 1
18:53 - flex 1 should stretch this out
18:58 - i was afraid it would do that
19:00 - um so
19:03 - it stretched it out the wrong way
19:05 - uh probably because we have it set
19:09 - um
19:11 - flex direction row
19:13 - that's why
19:14 - [Music]
19:18 - all right let's get rid of the flex
19:22 - all right um
19:26 - let's see
19:27 - all right youtube's telling me
19:29 - that the stream is
19:32 - not getting enough data
19:36 - let me
19:38 - check my
19:39 - connection
19:41 - [Music]
19:46 - that's weird
19:53 - connection seems all right let me know
19:55 - if uh if anybody's having trouble seeing
19:57 - this
19:59 - i'm gonna um
20:03 - oh yeah connection looks good
20:06 - maybe in about five minutes i'm gonna
20:08 - answer some questions so uh if you're in
20:09 - the chat right now asking questions and
20:11 - stuff hang in there for about five more
20:13 - minutes and then uh
20:15 - we'll uh we'll answer some questions
20:16 - here let's see
20:23 - i don't remember if you can do this in
20:25 - react native 100
20:28 - i'm pretty sure
20:29 - it's not going to give us what we want
20:31 - but it's worth a shot
20:33 - hey it worked
20:35 - now it works now on the web
20:38 - i'm not 100 sure it would work on mobile
20:40 - but
20:42 - that definitely made
20:43 - things larger and i don't want it i
20:46 - don't want it to be that big so what we
20:47 - can do though is we can say with 100
20:51 - but then we can also set a max
20:54 - width
20:57 - and
20:58 - we could see like you know what would we
21:00 - really want it to be like how wide is it
21:02 - right now
21:09 - 318
21:11 - uh what if we said you know we really
21:13 - never want it to be more than
21:16 - i don't know 280. let's just see 280 see
21:19 - how it looks
21:22 - [Music]
21:28 - okay um
21:30 - we could probably go a little bit
21:32 - smaller
21:34 - since we have our device
21:36 - id there let's see if we can get away
21:38 - with like
21:39 - 260.
21:45 - okay
21:47 - 260.
21:50 - that gives us
21:51 - enough space
21:52 - for our number now the reason that these
21:55 - little icons are showing up is because i
21:56 - have lastpass and so it's showing up
21:59 - there these won't normally show up
22:01 - unless somebody had lastpass
22:04 - but in case they do we'll have a little
22:06 - space for them
22:08 - so we got enough space for the device id
22:10 - and certainly enough space for the email
22:12 - and password doesn't matter because
22:15 - it doesn't really show up anyway
22:18 - and
22:26 - let's see
22:28 - [Music]
22:35 - oops
22:39 - i really
22:41 - don't like that these are right up next
22:43 - to the edge of this uh
22:47 - so i wonder if we could do something
22:49 - about that
22:55 - let's see if there is
22:58 - let's let's go to our documentation
23:00 - for our text input and see if there's
23:03 - some way to get a little bit of padding
23:06 - in between um this uh maybe we could
23:11 - let's just see if padding will work
23:14 - that's worth a shot and then we won't
23:16 - have to go to the documentation let's
23:18 - just say padding
23:21 - uh
23:22 - horizontal
23:24 - and let's give it a four for padding
23:26 - horizontal let's see what it does
23:28 - [Music]
23:30 - cool all right that gave us a little bit
23:32 - of padding okay
23:34 - awesome all right so that works
23:37 - um
23:42 - it's looking a little bit better
23:44 - uh this button
23:46 - says press me
23:48 - that's not what we wanted to say um
23:50 - [Music]
23:54 - so let's change what the button says
23:57 - so
24:00 - we wanted to say uh maybe
24:05 - submit
24:08 - see how that looks
24:12 - submit looks good
24:15 - uh also
24:16 - you know maybe we could
24:20 - do something with the way the button
24:21 - looks
24:23 - and i think there's probably some
24:25 - built-in
24:26 - styling options for this button so we
24:28 - definitely could look that that up
24:33 - so let's check out react native button
24:39 - and
24:43 - let's see this reference here
24:46 - [Music]
24:52 - oh cool we have accessibility label we
24:54 - should probably add that
24:58 - accessibility label and this takes a
25:00 - string
25:02 - and we can just say
25:05 - submit
25:06 - i think that's pretty straightforward
25:08 - but what you know submit with me
25:11 - okay we could color the colors for the
25:13 - color of the text in ios or the
25:17 - background color in android
25:19 - i'm not gonna worry about that now i'll
25:20 - just leave it as the default i mean
25:23 - just for uh
25:25 - otherwise i'm gonna take a long time to
25:27 - figure out what color i want it to be so
25:29 - i don't wanna
25:30 - um
25:31 - i don't wanna do that we're not working
25:33 - on end end tests yet so i'm gonna leave
25:35 - the test id out
25:37 - and let's see
25:39 - what else we have
25:41 - okay it looks like there's nothing else
25:43 - built in
25:45 - in terms of
25:49 - uh styling just let's see uh it's not
25:51 - gonna show us i was hoping we'd get a
25:53 - preview of what it would look on
25:55 - different devices but
25:57 - it doesn't show
25:58 - all right so what we can do is add style
26:01 - on here
26:08 - so and this will be the last thing we do
26:11 - before i go to the questions
26:15 - our styles.button and we have another
26:18 - button actually so
26:20 - let's make sure we uh
26:24 - we add this button and why is it saying
26:26 - style
26:29 - can we not give a style to this button
26:38 - hmm
26:39 - maybe we can
26:40 - [Music]
26:44 - maybe that's it maybe we're stuck with
26:45 - this this style which is fine
26:49 - i want to keep this very simple and
26:51 - for the for the first release
26:53 - you can always uh add
26:55 - um
26:59 - add in better better styles you know
27:01 - later on
27:02 - all right so here we go so we have our
27:05 - inputs and our submit button
27:08 - slightly better look to it a little bit
27:10 - more space here
27:12 - and
27:15 - now let me go to
27:17 - the
27:18 - chat let's set a timer here and you know
27:21 - this this timer that i've been using
27:23 - it's the tomatotimer.com
27:26 - it's been
27:27 - just stopping out of nowhere
27:29 - the last couple of days i might switch
27:31 - it up and
27:33 - go back i used to have a different timer
27:34 - that i used but i forgot the url for it
27:37 - but
27:37 - may have to switch it up all right so
27:40 - i'm going to try to answer as many
27:41 - questions as i can
27:42 - if i accidentally skip your question you
27:45 - know just like ask it again or put it
27:47 - down in the comments and i'll try to get
27:48 - to it
27:50 - [Music]
27:54 - right so um
27:55 - i have some questions people a few
27:57 - people asking uh what is a brain
27:59 - computer app so brain computer app is
28:01 - just an app that reads your brain waves
28:05 - uh well i should say this it's a
28:07 - device
28:09 - it's a combination of a device and an
28:11 - app so
28:12 - this is the device i'm using
28:14 - it is called the notion
28:17 - brain computer it's built by a company
28:19 - called neurocity it's a startup company
28:22 - and
28:23 - inside of this is the same tech you'd
28:26 - find in a cell phone
28:27 - uh and or like an internet of things
28:29 - device you put it on your head it reads
28:32 - your brain waves and then you can send
28:34 - those brainwaves to
28:36 - wherever you want
28:38 - in this case we're sending it to our app
28:40 - and for this app we're keeping it very
28:42 - simple and we're just tracking the level
28:45 - of focus i believe it's the gamma waves
28:48 - in your brain give you a good indication
28:50 - of how focused you are so we're tracking
28:53 - the level of focus and if the focus
28:55 - drops below a certain level we're
28:57 - changing the color of the screen and
28:59 - we're making the device vibrate
29:01 - and so that's what a brain computer app
29:03 - is for this project i hope to do some
29:06 - projects in the future where we do other
29:08 - things with the data coming out of the
29:10 - brain
29:11 - but this is kind of a proof of concept
29:13 - just to show that we can reliably get
29:15 - data to a mobile device through a react
29:20 - native app i'm using react native and
29:22 - expo
29:25 - so this is kind of phase one project one
29:28 - of
29:29 - you know working with brainwaves and uh
29:32 - react native
29:36 - uh alex asks if this is gonna be posted
29:38 - on the channel after the live stream
29:39 - ends yes it will and
29:42 - i will not delete it this time
29:46 - [Music]
29:54 - see
29:56 - uh
29:57 - rudra asks what is a variable in
29:59 - programming um a variable is
30:03 - a little piece of data
30:05 - right that you can assign well it's it's
30:08 - something that you can assign data to
30:10 - okay
30:11 - uh so let me give you a
30:14 - i gotta have a variable in here
30:15 - somewhere right
30:16 - where's here we go so
30:19 - we have const notion is a type of
30:21 - variable called a constant
30:23 - that means that we can't change it after
30:25 - we
30:26 - assign it a value and we've named your
30:28 - variable notion and that notion notion
30:30 - holds the value of a new notion that
30:34 - we've instantiated with a particular
30:36 - device id all right so a variable could
30:39 - be a lot of different kinds of data
30:43 - could be just a string which would be
30:44 - like a word
30:46 - uh or a number
30:47 - right it could be an object it could be
30:50 - an array so there's a variable could be
30:52 - a lot of different things but at its
30:54 - most basic thing it's just
30:57 - something that you use to hold a value
31:03 - [Music]
31:05 - hey everybody everybody saying hello
31:06 - from different parts of the world how's
31:08 - it going
31:16 - uh arnav asked what my time zone is i am
31:19 - in uh eastern standard time so it's the
31:22 - east coast of the united states
31:24 - is uh my time zone so same time zone as
31:27 - new york city
31:29 - um
31:30 - that's probably the biggest city i think
31:32 - in this time zone
31:36 - [Music]
31:41 - let's see
31:44 - uh my tommy says did you really delete
31:46 - it i unfortunately i really did delete
31:50 - the
31:51 - second part of this this stream uh the
31:54 - second part of this series so
31:56 - uh very upset about that like i was
31:59 - honestly like i felt sick when i
32:01 - realized uh what had happened
32:03 - so
32:04 - i mean there's still some small hope
32:06 - that somebody on youtube will get my
32:08 - feedback message and uh and have mercy
32:10 - on on my mistake and and bring the video
32:13 - back up but i just
32:14 - um from what i read online i don't think
32:17 - they do that i think at some point in
32:19 - the past they used to do that kind of
32:20 - thing but i don't i don't think they do
32:22 - it anymore so
32:23 - um
32:24 - we'll see
32:27 - [Music]
32:36 - all right
32:38 - [Music]
32:45 - okay
32:48 - [Music]
32:54 - [Music]
32:56 - all right so i'm just looking through
32:57 - trying to find uh questions just still a
32:59 - lot of people saying hello
33:01 - so
33:03 - um
33:13 - all right someone says hello from brazil
33:15 - hey how's it going
33:18 - um
33:19 - someone uh pranav says how much money
33:21 - can we earn in react native
33:23 - depends on where you get a job from here
33:25 - in the united states a react native
33:27 - developer could most certainly get a job
33:29 - making um over 100 thousand dollars a
33:32 - year
33:33 - it's it's definitely not
33:35 - uncommon for that to happen
33:38 - um different parts of the world are
33:39 - obviously very different um and it
33:42 - you know different companies pay
33:43 - differently but
33:45 - it's it's certainly
33:47 - certainly possible
33:48 - to make to make that much
33:52 - which unless you're in like a very big
33:53 - city that's that's an excellent salary
33:56 - like from where i'm from
33:58 - there's not very many people that that
34:00 - make that much money so
34:02 - um
34:04 - react native can can make you a lot of
34:06 - money
34:07 - i was born in one of the
34:09 - poorest states in the united states
34:11 - which the united states is a pretty
34:13 - wealthy country so i guess it's you know
34:15 - it's not super poor but it's just
34:18 - you know i
34:19 - don't really know that many people that
34:21 - made
34:21 - that much money uh when i was growing up
34:26 - all right awesome i actually got through
34:28 - most of the questions
34:29 - uh so we'll go back and do some more
34:31 - code
34:32 - um
34:34 - the last another question just came in
34:36 - right when i said that and it was a
34:37 - react native versus flutter who wins in
34:39 - your opinion
34:40 - uh i um
34:43 - i really can't comment on that because i
34:44 - haven't actually built anything with
34:46 - flutter
34:47 - so i feel like i'm not in a good place
34:49 - to comment i really like react native it
34:51 - can do a lot of things i've heard good
34:53 - things about flutter
34:55 - but like i said i can't i think you
34:57 - could build awesome things with react
34:58 - native or flutter
35:00 - obviously if i had to choose something
35:02 - to build a project with
35:04 - right now i'd choose react native
35:06 - because that's what i use every day and
35:08 - i i know it um but if i didn't know
35:11 - either one
35:12 - you know i would definitely take a look
35:14 - at flutter and see
35:16 - you know maybe i would maybe i would use
35:18 - it
35:19 - all right so let's go back i'm going to
35:21 - try setting my timer again see if it
35:23 - works this time
35:24 - and uh
35:26 - let's go back in here and i want to
35:29 - submit and see what our styling looks
35:31 - like on the
35:33 - once we're like logged in
35:35 - in the logged in view
35:36 - and also i don't want to forget so i'm
35:38 - going to tell you all right now so you
35:39 - can remind me
35:41 - um
35:42 - the uh
35:45 - um
35:47 - red flash so we we put in a style where
35:49 - like the screen would flash red
35:51 - if your focus got below a certain level
35:54 - that when you first start up the app
35:57 - that red
35:58 - is like the default color so we don't
36:00 - want that to happen so i think i'd like
36:03 - to
36:05 - try to get rid of that as the default
36:07 - color so we'll take a look at our styles
36:08 - and see how we can do that
36:12 - but otherwise let's
36:15 - let's login
36:20 - [Music]
36:24 - and
36:25 - let's see let me grab my password
36:41 - cool
36:48 - all right so
36:49 - one thing i'm i'm seeing here is the
36:51 - focus text is quite small
36:54 - and it's very close to this log out
36:56 - button so i think
36:58 - what i'd like to do here is make this
37:00 - text a bit bigger and add a little space
37:02 - here between focus and log out
37:07 - and that's probably about it in terms of
37:09 - styling right so i said we're not it's
37:11 - not going to look very
37:13 - like really pretty
37:14 - uh but
37:16 - i want it to look like it's not broken
37:18 - or anything like that
37:21 - and uh
37:24 - let's see
37:31 - where's our style i keep losing my uh
37:34 - styles object
37:36 - well i guess we don't really
37:39 - we want to put a separate style on our
37:40 - focus text
37:43 - so
37:44 - because i don't want it to be quite as
37:45 - big as the heading so
37:48 - style equals
37:50 - and let's just
37:53 - i'm just going to call it focus
37:58 - focus text
38:00 - probably not the best name especially if
38:01 - we reuse this style if we end up reusing
38:03 - it we'll rename it to something a little
38:05 - bit more generic
38:06 - but for now i think that'll that'll work
38:09 - so let's say
38:12 - focus text
38:13 - [Music]
38:15 - and
38:16 - let's make the font size
38:21 - let's give it 18.
38:23 - okay that'll be nice nice and big for
38:25 - readability uh but then also
38:29 - not definitely uh like noticeably
38:31 - smaller than the than the heading
38:34 - and then
38:36 - let's give it uh let's say eight eight
38:38 - pixels
38:40 - on the bottom
38:41 - between the button and the focus text so
38:44 - we're gonna do a margin
38:48 - bottom
38:49 - of
38:51 - eight
38:52 - i keep saying pixels but
38:54 - when i i say pixels out of habit but i
38:57 - really just mean like units right
38:59 - whatever that translates to on a
39:01 - particular device okay
39:03 - all right that's that's better a little
39:05 - bit of separation there
39:07 - we can see what the focus is
39:09 - and um
39:11 - yeah let's see
39:13 - that looks good the only other thing i
39:14 - want to do is uh
39:16 - what do you think about this focus
39:20 - um
39:22 - right now the focus is a number between
39:24 - 0 and 1. do you think it would be easier
39:26 - for the user if they saw that as a
39:28 - percentage so instead of 0.23 if they
39:30 - saw 23 percent
39:33 - do you think that would be easier
39:35 - let me know what you all think uh in the
39:37 - chat uh
39:39 - it wouldn't be too hard to you know make
39:41 - that display as a percentage
39:44 - um and then it might be a little bit
39:46 - more obvious to say like oh i'm 100
39:48 - focused i'm only 20 focus
39:50 - uh
39:52 - yeah let me know what you think
39:54 - looks like i got one yes for that
39:56 - nice okay
39:59 - um
40:03 - okay we got a couple of yeses
40:06 - cool let's let's do it
40:09 - all right so
40:11 - right now we are showing the focus here
40:14 - is just the raw data of focus
40:17 - um but
40:18 - what we could do is we could say
40:21 - like focus
40:23 - and we could multiply that by 100
40:28 - and then we can add in a percentage sign
40:31 - and let's see
40:35 - see how that looks
40:37 - cool 23
40:41 - see not not too hard
40:44 - um
40:45 - i don't know why 23 keeps coming up as
40:47 - the default like
40:49 - i have no idea maybe that's just the
40:51 - baseline that comes through maybe that's
40:52 - the last value that came through before
40:54 - i turned my device off last time i don't
40:57 - know
40:57 - um
40:59 - cool now you notice we still are seeing
41:02 - that flash of red every time we we
41:05 - restart
41:06 - so let's look at our styles and see how
41:08 - we have that set up
41:11 - uh so it looks like
41:13 - we're saying
41:15 - uh
41:16 - the background color
41:18 - we're saying if the focus is less than
41:21 - 0.2 or 20
41:24 - and
41:25 - we have a user
41:28 - then display red otherwise display white
41:39 - now i don't know if this will work but
41:41 - it's it's possible
41:43 - that if we just switch these around
41:45 - maybe it would read the white first
41:50 - and we should be able to do that
41:52 - if we just say
41:57 - if the focus is
42:01 - greater we'll just flip around these
42:03 - values
42:04 - greater than 0.2 and we don't have a
42:06 - user
42:08 - then let's display
42:13 - white otherwise red
42:15 - i don't know if this is going to solve
42:16 - our problem
42:18 - but if there's some sort of solution
42:20 - that might work and it's very easy to
42:22 - try
42:23 - i'm always up for trying it
42:30 - and no that did not work at all
42:36 - that that is in fact the opposite of
42:38 - what we wanted how did i get the
42:40 - opposite
42:41 - um
42:46 - let's see
42:48 - and uh
42:52 - let's see sorry i gotta somebody's
42:53 - trying to say
42:55 - not nice stuff so
42:57 - um
43:01 - just gonna hide the
43:03 - messages
43:08 - okay
43:12 - all right so that definitely didn't work
43:15 - and uh
43:19 - let's see
43:24 - let's
43:29 - look so you guys somebody else is
43:31 - spamming a lot of messages so
43:35 - um
43:39 - there we go all right that'll clean up
43:41 - the chat a little bit sorry about that
43:45 - okay
43:48 - all right what the heck did i do here
43:49 - well let's go
43:50 - let's just go back because that's not
43:52 - what we wanted
43:57 - there we go
44:00 - there we go all right
44:02 - so that's better
44:10 - hmm
44:15 - oh let me see i'm gonna check the chat
44:17 - as well to see if any of you realize
44:18 - what my mistake was
44:49 - see
44:51 - aj
44:52 - says
44:53 - hey aj how's it going uh aj's one of the
44:56 - um
44:57 - uh co-founders of neurocity and uh who
45:00 - made this
45:01 - uh this device so
45:03 - the uh
45:05 - notion headset
45:07 - um
45:10 - aj says last value
45:13 - is that what i
45:18 - [Music]
45:20 - i don't know if he was referring to what
45:22 - i was doing here or commenting on
45:24 - somebody else
45:27 - okay
45:29 - um
45:30 - all right let's let me think for a
45:32 - second on how we could make that work
45:35 - i'd rather try to avoid the flash of red
45:38 - if we could
45:39 - but it's not like uh
45:41 - absolutely have to have
45:47 - let's see so
45:50 - [Music]
46:10 - actually if i reverse these
46:12 - colors and we get a flash
46:16 - flash of white
46:18 - maybe it would be
46:25 - [Music]
46:34 - oh now i know why i did that right
46:36 - because i said if we
46:39 - don't have a user
46:41 - [Music]
46:51 - now i confuse myself
46:54 - all right
46:57 - let's go back to what i did before so i
47:00 - know for sure i want focus if focus is
47:03 - greater
47:04 - than point two i want it to be white
47:07 - for sure
47:14 - there we go
47:15 - focus is greater than point two i want
47:17 - it to be white
47:19 - let's get rid of this for a second
47:22 - right
47:24 - [Music]
47:31 - and
47:34 - could we switch it
47:36 - yeah let's which is so folks greater
47:38 - than point you want to do white and then
47:42 - if
47:44 - user
47:45 - [Music]
47:46 - red
47:47 - all right this is
47:49 - a slightly more complicated thing but
47:51 - let's see if it works
47:54 - ah we still got the flash
47:57 - let's see if it'll happen if i save
47:59 - again will this happen oops
48:01 - if we save
48:06 - all right actually didn't happen let me
48:08 - actually change something and then we'll
48:09 - see
48:12 - all right we're still getting that
48:13 - flasher red
48:15 - i guess it doesn't matter
48:16 - uh now what this does is i just kind of
48:19 - split it up and added two kind of like
48:21 - two turn areas so
48:23 - um it's saying like if the focus is
48:25 - greater than
48:28 - 0.2 then we just make it
48:31 - white but if it's not then we go to the
48:33 - the right side
48:35 - of our ternary and then we check and see
48:37 - is there a user
48:40 - if there is no user
48:43 - us if there's no user
48:45 - then we do nothing
48:47 - which would make the default color
48:51 - um
48:53 - i guess nothing it would be whatever the
48:55 - default normally is
48:58 - which i'm assuming is just white
49:01 - or
49:04 - would it be red
49:07 - hmm
49:10 - i wonder if we even need to add white
49:12 - like what's our default without it
49:14 - let's um
49:17 - save that
49:20 - all right cool yeah so we don't really
49:22 - even need white so i'm thinking we could
49:26 - we could get rid of
49:28 - the white altogether because we don't
49:30 - need it
49:32 - and
49:33 - instead
49:36 - [Music]
49:38 - we could do these ends
49:42 - we'll switch the focus back to
49:44 - if focus is less than two
49:50 - all right we're still getting our um our
49:53 - flash
49:55 - of red that i don't want but we're able
49:58 - to get rid of our our white we don't
50:01 - need it
50:07 - uh two we do have
50:14 - what we could try to do
50:16 - instead is
50:22 - let's try this out
50:24 - well first i'm going to look at the chat
50:25 - and see if anybody has an idea
50:31 - all right it looks like no
50:33 - but uh here's what i'm thinking
50:36 - y'all can let me know what you think
50:37 - about this idea what if we take out
50:40 - all of this logic from here and instead
50:42 - in this use effect which we're already
50:44 - using to turn on and off the vibration
50:46 - we use this to change the color
50:50 - and
50:51 - we can set the color as part of state
50:57 - [Music]
51:00 - i don't know i think it's worth a try
51:02 - uh in which case
51:04 - let's go up here
51:06 - if we get any more state we might have
51:08 - to
51:09 - clean this up a little bit but for now i
51:11 - think this will be
51:12 - this would be fine and we can
51:15 - yeah let's clean this up here
51:18 - and let's say
51:24 - um let's say b
51:26 - g color
51:33 - set background color
51:35 - and we're going to go use state
51:39 - and the default background color is
51:41 - going to be white
51:43 - ffff
51:44 - and let's see
51:47 - let's use some typestrip stuff here i
51:49 - think we can say
51:54 - i'm using typescript but as somebody
51:56 - pointed out to me in the comments it's a
51:59 - typescript project but i'm not actually
52:01 - using types so let's see if we can
52:04 - uh
52:06 - use types here
52:09 - so what this is doing let's see if it
52:12 - actually is doing this yep so right now
52:14 - we're basically using typescript to say
52:16 - x can only be white or red
52:19 - we could add more if we wanted but for
52:20 - right now this can only be white or red
52:22 - and it's going to give us some cool
52:24 - autocomplete stuff which
52:26 - let's check it out down here so
52:31 - we can set the
52:33 - background set
52:35 - set bg color
52:37 - and
52:38 - oops
52:40 - now we're going to say we can either do
52:42 - white or red those are options so let's
52:45 - throw in the option of red
52:47 - and then
52:48 - we gotta set it back the other way right
52:53 - so
52:54 - if we're not if we are focused if we
52:57 - regain a certain level of focus let's
52:59 - reset this to
53:01 - white
53:05 - cool now down here
53:07 - we can just set our background color to
53:10 - bg color
53:13 - so
53:15 - if this works let's see if it works
53:17 - first if it does i think i kind of like
53:18 - that better because all the actions that
53:21 - happen
53:22 - when terms of a shift in focus are all
53:25 - located in one place
53:27 - and then
53:29 - we keep logic out of our styles
53:31 - so it looks a little bit cleaner
53:33 - and i totally forgot to look to see if
53:35 - this even changed did anything
53:38 - let's see
53:44 - sweet we got rid of that flash now we
53:47 - just have to see like did it actually
53:49 - work
53:50 - so i'm gonna turn on the headset
54:00 - and
54:01 - i gotta
54:04 - give it a second to turn on and connect
54:06 - right it's starting up
54:11 - it takes just a couple seconds to start
54:13 - up once it starts up i'm going to put it
54:15 - on
54:16 - and um
54:17 - see if we can get that focus down lower
54:20 - actually if it's stuck at 23 we can
54:22 - probably change it
54:24 - let's just
54:25 - let's cheat and just change it right
54:28 - here
54:30 - hey cool
54:32 - so we get red
54:33 - and if this was a mobile device it would
54:36 - be vibrating
54:38 - now let's switch it back
54:42 - and we get white
54:43 - cool
54:45 - so now the color
54:47 - is set all right and then the notion
54:50 - is uh it's starting up so i can see on
54:54 - my other screen i've got a dashboard up
54:57 - it's uh starting the operating system on
54:59 - the uh on the headset so it should be
55:01 - starting pretty soon
55:03 - and there's a lot going on in the chat
55:05 - so
55:07 - uh i'm gonna get back to that in a few
55:09 - minutes here
55:11 - yeah about five minutes i'm gonna get
55:13 - back to the chat
55:15 - all right
55:19 - that's cool
55:20 - um let's clean this up a little bit so
55:24 - if the user sell set user else
55:29 - um
55:32 - let's get rid of this
55:35 - else since we're not doing anything
55:36 - there
55:42 - and
55:44 - see if
55:49 - i think that was the only spot where we
55:51 - had unused code
55:56 - all right cool so we are connected now
55:59 - i'll put this on for a little bit so we
56:00 - can get some real data
56:28 - okay cool
56:29 - so we should be getting real data here
56:31 - uh i've got a
56:33 - an okay signal coming in
56:36 - oh goodness
56:38 - all right i just noticed something i
56:39 - don't know if you caught that on the
56:40 - screen but we we got a ton of decimal
56:44 - places out here so
56:45 - i don't want all those decimal places so
56:47 - let's let's make sure that we don't
56:50 - uh we don't have that
56:51 - and um actually that was kind of weird
56:54 - that that even came on the screen
56:55 - because we do have this two fixed two
57:01 - that's odd
57:03 - so set focus the number we're putting
57:06 - into focus is actually already with with
57:08 - two fixed so
57:11 - yeah we came up again
57:14 - very weird
57:18 - which i kind of don't want to show a
57:19 - bunch of decimal places anyway
57:22 - so let's just go ahead and uh
57:25 - add
57:26 - where are we at
57:32 - this focus
57:34 - um
57:37 - let's go dot
57:39 - two fixed uh you know maybe when we're
57:42 - multiplying it's it's messing it up and
57:44 - let's just see can we do two fig zero
57:47 - is that going to mess it up number not
57:49 - too fake
57:53 - returns a string representing a number
57:56 - interesting
58:02 - let's see if we can
58:11 - oops not on the end
58:15 - put that in the wrong spot
58:18 - there we go
58:22 - two fixed
58:28 - see if that works
58:31 - all right now
58:33 - we may or may not see that that number
58:36 - pop up but i'm thinking that since we're
58:39 - doing this after any calculation takes
58:41 - place then we'll actually get two fixed
58:43 - zero which means we will have no decimal
58:46 - places
58:48 - so
58:49 - that was cool i'm glad i put the headset
58:51 - on to see that
58:52 - that particular bug
58:56 - the auto formatting on that is a little
58:58 - weird but
59:03 - cool
59:05 - [Music]
59:10 - all right so
59:14 - am i
59:15 - i only got like another minute before i
59:17 - wanted to stop and go back to the
59:19 - channel
59:26 - what i wanted to do next if i had time
59:28 - was start to get this ready to to go to
59:30 - the app store
59:32 - so
59:33 - what i'm going to do is just kind of go
59:35 - through what we need
59:37 - so let's go to
59:41 - expo
59:46 - and
59:48 - let's see
59:49 - get started
59:53 - pre-project
59:58 - documentation that's what i want
60:02 - so
60:04 - i'm using expo to help us build this uh
60:07 - react native app
60:09 - so
60:10 - we they have documentation for
60:22 - so some of the stuff that we haven't
60:24 - done yet is like the splash screen
60:27 - so
60:29 - it's just something that'll show up
60:32 - in the app
60:33 - and so we could add this into our app an
60:36 - app icon
60:39 - so we got to think about what we want to
60:40 - do for the app icon i'm i'm not really
60:43 - any good with any type of like photo or
60:45 - image editing stuff so i'll probably
60:47 - just find something online
60:49 - that like automatically creates all the
60:51 - icon sizes that we need
60:54 - um that'll be uh
60:57 - let's see walk through
61:01 - i know there's
61:02 - there was some documentation that
61:06 - talked about actually releasing stuff to
61:08 - the app store
61:14 - i don't know where it went
61:17 - there we go publish your app
61:19 - this will publish
61:22 - all right so there's a couple options we
61:23 - could do with publish
61:25 - um
61:27 - we could publish through uh through expo
61:30 - or could publish um like on my own
61:33 - server so i haven't decided what i want
61:35 - to do
61:39 - so that would be the first step
61:41 - and then we would actually deploy so i'm
61:44 - gonna skip the apple store for now and
61:46 - we're gonna go to android in the google
61:48 - play store and uh this is the next step
61:51 - of what we need to do
61:53 - [Music]
61:56 - so
61:58 - we basically are gonna run
62:00 - an expo command
62:02 - and
62:05 - it's going to bundle everything for us
62:07 - so we just need to make sure that we
62:08 - have our our app.json file
62:11 - sorted out
62:12 - and it has the right info in there
62:17 - and then
62:19 - i already have an account for the google
62:21 - play store
62:22 - so we should submit it like if we get
62:25 - the bundle right then we can submit it
62:28 - and um
62:32 - it says we can do it manually
62:34 - um and then we can actually just upload
62:36 - it straight from the command line which
62:38 - is pretty sweet once we do it manually
62:40 - the first time and i'll try to do as
62:42 - much as possible with this on a live
62:43 - stream i don't know if i'll do it today
62:45 - because i've been streaming already for
62:46 - you know over an hour
62:48 - but the next stream this is what we're
62:50 - going to be working on
62:52 - uh
62:53 - i don't know how long it will take to
62:54 - get approved
62:56 - but you know i'll let everybody know
62:57 - once it gets gets approved but basically
62:59 - that's these are the next steps that
63:01 - we're going to do
63:04 - and um
63:06 - really i think the hardest part at this
63:07 - point is just making sure that our
63:10 - app.json is looking good and
63:13 - figuring out what i want my app icon to
63:16 - be because i really have no idea
63:18 - um but i'll show you right now what our
63:21 - app.json looks like so
63:24 - right now
63:25 - it's just whatever was the default which
63:27 - it takes the name from
63:29 - with the name i put in when i started
63:30 - the project
63:32 - right so
63:33 - um
63:34 - i believe the icon is like the default
63:37 - expo icon in the same way with the
63:38 - splash so we can see like
63:41 - this icon is just the default that comes
63:44 - with the project it's blank same thing
63:45 - with the splash
63:47 - you know rather not have
63:49 - nothing there
63:50 - uh but
63:52 - at least like there's something there
63:54 - right it wouldn't it wouldn't throw an
63:55 - error saying it's nothing there
63:57 - um
63:59 - so yeah that's
64:00 - that's about it not really not much else
64:03 - left to do uh to actually deploy this so
64:06 - now
64:07 - having said that the only people that
64:09 - are really going to be able to use this
64:10 - or you know anybody that has one of
64:11 - these headsets
64:13 - i mean anybody could download it but
64:15 - they're not going to be able to get the
64:16 - brain data right so
64:18 - um
64:20 - it'll be a very very limited audience
64:23 - and
64:24 - after that there's other features i'd
64:26 - like to add to this
64:28 - uh and i'd like to have it a web version
64:31 - and an ios version so
64:33 - those are the next steps for now i'm
64:35 - gonna go back to the chat and answer the
64:38 - rest of the questions and uh
64:42 - let's see
64:43 - i guess so
64:47 - i'm gonna keep keep tracking my focus
64:49 - here while we
64:50 - while i answer questions
64:54 - right let's see
64:55 - let me figure out where i i left off at
65:12 - uh let's see um
65:15 - finding you says can you tell me the
65:17 - prerequisite of this course
65:19 - um
65:20 - i don't really know like what the uh
65:23 - um
65:24 - prerequisites would be like it would
65:26 - definitely help if you know a little bit
65:27 - about
65:28 - um
65:29 - react native
65:31 - uh
65:32 - i guess other than that
65:34 - you know you don't really need to know
65:35 - much uh in terms of like the brain
65:37 - computer interface like
65:39 - it's
65:40 - uh it just it has a javascript api so
65:43 - you don't need to know a lot about the
65:45 - internal workings of what's happening
65:54 - see
66:01 - [Music]
66:08 - let's see
66:15 - uh a question that says do you have a
66:18 - cat i do not have a cat no i don't i
66:21 - have
66:22 - i have four children and uh no cat i
66:25 - have the only pets that i have right now
66:27 - are two goldfish they're behind me
66:39 - [Music]
66:43 - oh
66:45 - [Music]
66:47 - let's see
66:50 - so there's a lot going on in the chat
66:52 - but not a lot of questions so i'm
66:54 - uh trying to find the questions
66:57 - all right so there's some some questions
66:59 - and comments based on the uh that red
67:01 - screen that kept uh coming up
67:04 - when we didn't want it to so thank you
67:05 - for all the the advice on there
67:10 - [Music]
67:15 - i mean uh so what's the app's purpose
67:17 - the purpose is to uh let
67:20 - let the user know when their focus is
67:23 - dropped below a certain level
67:28 - it's crazy you can see uh how much
67:31 - like trying to
67:33 - go through the questions and like move
67:34 - back and forth lowers my focus
67:37 - normally if i'm just coding my focus is
67:39 - a lot higher than this like more
67:41 - consistently
67:42 - but but trying to talk and read the chat
67:47 - uh
67:48 - really
67:48 - like
67:50 - i guess like diverts my my attention
67:54 - [Music]
68:00 - [Music]
68:06 - there's a ton of uh comments about
68:07 - hacking in here
68:09 - uh
68:12 - i don't know how he had on the topic of
68:13 - hacking in here but there's a
68:15 - i just keep scrolling and it's all this
68:17 - talk of hacking
68:31 - i'm trying to sift through all this uh
68:34 - chat to find uh any
68:37 - all questions
68:37 - here's a question are you using c-sharp
68:39 - i'm not using c-sharp in this uh and
68:42 - this application no
68:44 - this is all uh javascript well
68:46 - typescript technically
68:48 - and uh so it's typescript
68:50 - which uh actually i just recorded a
68:52 - typescript tutorial video last night i
68:54 - think i'm going to
68:56 - um
68:57 - put it on my youtube channel tomorrow so
69:00 - maybe tomorrow morning at some point
69:01 - tomorrow and uh so if you're interested
69:04 - in learning more about typescript check
69:05 - that out
69:06 - yesterday i released a video about
69:10 - documentation for javascript
69:12 - and it's not that long i think it's like
69:14 - less than less than 15 minutes or 20
69:17 - minutes or so but if you're interested
69:18 - in that check out my youtube channel the
69:20 - uh the links in the description of this
69:22 - video
69:23 - and the typescript one i think the
69:25 - typestrip one will be pretty helpful
69:27 - i was thinking about re-recording it
69:29 - because i
69:31 - i made it when i was tired and i look
69:34 - really tired and i keep saying uh and um
69:36 - a lot
69:38 - so
69:39 - if i don't re-record it and i just
69:41 - release it which i might just release it
69:43 - because i don't have a lot of time and i
69:45 - really don't want to spend a ton of time
69:47 - going over the videos because then
69:50 - i have less time for my family and i
69:53 - just overall put out less content
69:56 - but i recommend watching it at double
69:58 - speed
69:59 - because then it's not quite so annoying
70:01 - did i say uh and um
70:03 - i'm gonna try to work on that more maybe
70:05 - i just need to not record videos when
70:08 - i'm really tired because i tend to do it
70:09 - more when i'm tired
70:12 - but that video will come out
70:15 - it be recorded or in its current state
70:17 - it'll come out tomorrow on my youtube
70:18 - channel and i actually think it'll be
70:21 - pretty helpful
70:23 - based on
70:25 - what would have been helpful to me when
70:27 - i started with typescript that i tried
70:29 - to make the video in a way that i would
70:32 - have found helpful so
70:34 - if anybody's interested check it out
70:46 - uh i mean says what's the machine you're
70:48 - using uh i'm i'm using a pc
70:51 - so it's
70:52 - i i don't even know what brand pc it is
70:54 - but it's like windows 10 pc and
71:00 - where did i get it from
71:02 - i don't remember
71:04 - i don't think i got it from amazon i
71:06 - think i got it from like new egg or
71:08 - tiger direct or something like that
71:19 - oh okay i mean clarified i think i mean
71:23 - uh meant to say like what what device is
71:26 - in like this this headset device so this
71:29 - this is the neurocity notion headset
71:32 - and in the description i i
71:34 - spell it out too as well so you can
71:36 - check it out but
71:37 - this is
71:38 - a spring computer
71:42 - it is a brain computer or brain computer
71:45 - interface
71:46 - and
71:47 - inside of it
71:49 - are
71:50 - the same parts you'd find inside your
71:52 - cell
71:52 - phone and it can connect to wi-fi
71:56 - and
71:58 - it takes all your
72:00 - your data from your brain and then
72:02 - provides a javascript api so that you
72:05 - can link it up
72:07 - to your
72:08 - to your app or your website or whatever
72:11 - whatever you want to link it up to
72:15 - [Music]
72:20 - oh i mean also asked how much does it
72:22 - cost
72:23 - i
72:24 - i'm not sure what the cost is right now
72:27 - because i think they're working on
72:28 - another model this is it's kind of like
72:30 - a um like a testing device this is
72:33 - um
72:35 - i i don't know what you want to call it
72:36 - but this is like the first version just
72:39 - for developers to work on and it was a
72:41 - thousand dollars i don't know what the
72:44 - price is currently or what it will be
72:47 - when they start making more of these
72:54 - kevin says configuring a splashing
72:56 - screen in react native is as dangerous
72:58 - as eating the hottest pepper in the
73:00 - world why i hope i can do it
73:08 - sergey says in 2004 i created a
73:11 - calculator in basic i thought i'd become
73:13 - a superstar in the programming world but
73:15 - i only got older and i still make
73:17 - calculators
73:19 - actually in 2004 i made a calculator in
73:23 - c plus
73:25 - and
73:26 - then i didn't code for a long time after
73:29 - that but i did i do remember i don't
73:32 - really remember anything else that i
73:33 - coded in that class but i remember a
73:35 - calculator
73:38 - [Music]
73:43 - kevin says is python or java better
73:46 - i don't i don't really know in terms of
73:48 - better it depends on the application
73:52 - it seems like python has way more
73:54 - momentum right now
73:57 - whoa
73:59 - somebody's spamming the channel let's uh
74:01 - should we let me keep saying should we
74:03 - make app using pythons um let me get rid
74:06 - of
74:07 - [Music]
74:11 - let me hide these messages yeah please
74:14 - don't spam the channel
74:17 - [Music]
74:22 - the question is that was being spammed
74:24 - by
74:25 - at least two people that i see is
74:27 - maybe three people was should we make an
74:30 - app using python
74:33 - and um
74:35 - yeah if you want to that's
74:38 - uh it's
74:39 - it's entirely up to you python's a good
74:41 - language
74:42 - so
74:43 - if if you feel like that would be good
74:47 - then
74:48 - you'll go go ahead with it
74:52 - [Music]
74:56 - someone asked if they could be moderator
74:58 - uh i would mute people or spamming i was
75:00 - actually just thinking that it might be
75:01 - good to be to have a moderator it seems
75:03 - like the last few streams we've had more
75:06 - people spamming than than normal
75:08 - so um i'm going to think about it thank
75:11 - you for offering i'm going to see if if
75:13 - the next stream is is this bad
75:16 - with spam again then i think we'll
75:18 - definitely need to
75:19 - uh to have a moderator because it makes
75:22 - it really hard to for everybody and for
75:24 - me to
75:26 - read the chat
75:29 - and there's no need to spam you know i
75:31 - get to the questions
75:36 - eventually all right
75:39 - let's see
75:43 - i can't pronounce this name
75:45 - but it says can you learn a language in
75:48 - two weeks
75:49 - i don't know i mean if you already knew
75:52 - a few programming languages
75:54 - then
75:58 - maybe you could learn enough about
75:59 - another one to code but if you were
76:01 - starting from scratch and you had no
76:03 - idea how to code
76:04 - then i don't i don't know that you could
76:06 - really learn a coding language in two
76:07 - weeks
76:08 - uh amin says why did you start youtube
76:11 - um i i started doing youtube
76:14 - uh because i
76:17 - i wanted to share my work i was working
76:19 - at a university and i wanted to share my
76:21 - work with some of the computer science
76:22 - students there and see if they'd be
76:24 - interested in
76:25 - and helping out
76:27 - with with some of the work
76:29 - and
76:30 - i ended up
76:32 - getting a larger audience outside of the
76:34 - university and started you know catering
76:38 - my streaming towards them
76:40 - and then beau carnes from free code camp
76:42 - saw my live stream and invited me to
76:43 - stream on the free code camp channel and
76:46 - so that's that's why i got started
76:48 - and basically i keep doing it because i
76:50 - just hope that
76:52 - you know my streams would be helpful to
76:53 - someone else
76:56 - and um
76:58 - yeah so i don't
76:59 - i don't get any money from this this is
77:01 - all volunteer even on my own youtube
77:03 - channel i don't monetize
77:06 - you know if i at some point in future
77:08 - like maybe i think about monetizing like
77:10 - if i really wanted to produce a ton of
77:11 - content and do it as kind of like a
77:13 - part-time job i would think about it but
77:15 - for now it's all just volunteer and i
77:17 - just i like
77:18 - sharing information and helping people
77:20 - learn
77:29 - [Music]
77:32 - uh inside out says can you measure pre
77:34 - and post stimulant using this app for
77:36 - scientific proof
77:37 - actually that's kind of interesting i've
77:39 - never thought about knowing that before
77:40 - but
77:41 - that would be kind of cool to
77:43 - measure your level of focus at doing a
77:46 - certain task
77:48 - depending on what stimulants you would
77:50 - take like to see maybe if you had a lot
77:52 - of caffeine does that help your focus or
77:54 - does it hurt your focus that would be
77:56 - kind of cool to do um
77:59 - so i i would imagine you know you could
78:01 - probably get some good data on that
78:03 - you'd have to
78:04 - really make sure that
78:06 - you controlled all the other variables
78:08 - like noise and like time of day level of
78:11 - sleep like there'd be a lot of other
78:12 - variables that
78:14 - could kind of mess it up but if you did
78:15 - it consistently then i think it could be
78:18 - um
78:19 - yeah that would be kind of a cool
78:21 - experiment
78:24 - [Music]
78:31 - uh i mean as my inspiration my favorite
78:33 - go-to resources
78:35 - yeah
78:36 - my inspiration uh for coding is like i
78:38 - just like coding and um
78:42 - i
78:43 - i love uh
78:44 - like when i hear that some a video that
78:46 - i've done
78:48 - has helped somebody
78:49 - like that's that's inspiration right
78:53 - i'm not gonna lie at first my
78:54 - inspiration to get into coding was i had
78:56 - a couple kids and a wife and i needed to
79:00 - pay the bills and this was a way to make
79:02 - money
79:03 - all right i mean i did like to do it but
79:05 - it was definitely like
79:07 - it was how i could get a good job to be
79:08 - able to provide for my family uh but now
79:12 - like
79:13 - in terms of keeping going with the
79:15 - youtube stuff is you know whenever it
79:17 - helps somebody that's
79:20 - that's provides me with more inspiration
79:22 - to actually do
79:23 - uh more content
79:26 - i know there's probably a lot of noise
79:27 - there's my kids playing upstairs so i'm
79:29 - probably i'm gonna try to end the live
79:31 - stream here in a couple minutes so i can
79:32 - go hang out with my kids before it's
79:34 - time time for them to go to bed
79:36 - um
79:37 - and there was i think there's a part two
79:39 - to that question oh your favorite go-to
79:40 - resources uh when i was starting out i
79:43 - used free code camp a lot and did a lot
79:45 - of youtube videos and stuff like watched
79:47 - a lot of youtube videos
79:48 - now though i'd say like my favorite
79:50 - resources are just the documentation for
79:53 - what i'm using
79:54 - and stack overflow and mozilla developer
79:58 - network mdn
80:05 - i have a question how many programming
80:06 - language do you know slash understand um
80:09 - i mainly code in javascript and
80:11 - typescript
80:12 - i can understand
80:14 - coding in c sharp
80:17 - and i've i've worked with in the past
80:20 - java
80:22 - c-sharp
80:24 - python
80:25 - c plus plus
80:27 - i think what else
80:31 - see
80:32 - like
80:33 - i it's been so long since i've used
80:35 - those languages i don't really know
80:37 - if i could jump in and code anything in
80:39 - them right now
80:40 - but i could probably look at
80:43 - uh like a simple application and tell
80:45 - what was going on
80:47 - uh but i i wouldn't
80:49 - i don't know that i would say that like
80:50 - i know them you know
80:52 - but if i had to use them and had a
80:54 - little bit of time to get
80:55 - um
80:56 - kind of like
80:58 - get acquainted with him again i could
81:00 - probably code something
81:03 - i mean says do you already have a job
81:04 - yes i do i have a job i'm a senior
81:06 - software engineer
81:07 - uh at a company called dick sporting
81:09 - goods
81:11 - [Music]
81:15 - mh08 says this is only my second live
81:17 - chat with free code camp i learn stuff
81:19 - thank you for doing it
81:20 - oh you're welcome thank you so much for
81:22 - watching
81:24 - [Music]
81:26 - uh sergey has to go see you later sergey
81:28 - thanks for watching
81:32 - [Music]
81:37 - all right
81:38 - um
81:40 - all right i'm gonna i got through all
81:42 - the questions i think if i miss your
81:43 - question please put it in the
81:45 - uh comments below on this video
81:48 - i'm gonna wrap things up now and go go
81:50 - hang out with the kids for a little bit
81:52 - um
81:53 - if you uh if you liked the video you
81:56 - know please join us again for another
81:58 - live stream i'm gonna try to do this
82:00 - maybe uh saturday maybe i'll try to do
82:02 - another stream
82:03 - and uh check out my youtube channel the
82:05 - links in the description i just put out
82:07 - a new video yesterday and i got another
82:09 - one coming out tomorrow
82:10 - a tutorial on documentation for
82:12 - javascript and another tutorial on
82:14 - typescript
82:16 - and um
82:17 - feel free to follow me on social media
82:19 - links are in the description you can ask
82:21 - me whatever you want and i'll do my best
82:23 - to get back to you
82:26 - i mean coding related stuff is probably
82:28 - the best you could certainly ask me
82:29 - whatever you want but i don't know how
82:31 - helpful i'll be in other areas of life
82:34 - but anyway thanks so much for for all
82:37 - everyone's help all the the nice
82:39 - questions in the chat in the in the live
82:41 - chat i'm getting really excited about
82:42 - this project i can't wait to release it
82:44 - to the app store and that's going to be
82:46 - the goal for this weekend is actually
82:48 - get it submitted
82:49 - to the uh the google play store
82:52 - and uh
82:54 - that'll this will actually be my first
82:55 - app that i'm submitting
82:57 - to the store
82:59 - so that'll be
83:01 - that'll be exciting and i'm excited to
83:03 - actually do it live for everybody to see
83:06 - and uh hopefully then that will help you
83:07 - out if if you want to do your own apps
83:09 - but
83:10 - uh until then
83:12 - uh have a great day uh thank you so much
83:15 - and stay safe

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to keep working on our brain computer app we have all of our phase one functionality working but it doesn't look very good so we need to style it a little bit just make it look a little bit nicer it doesn't have to be like amazing right but uh we want to look a little bit better and if we get through that today then we're gonna do whatever else we need to do to get it ready to actually go to the google play store we're gonna launch this first as an android app later on on ios i happen to have an android phone so that's why i'm doing android first and i'm on a pc so i i do have a mac that i can use to launch this as an ios app as well but it's not as good for streaming so we're going to try this first as an android app since the last time we streamed i did install uh android studio so we can simulate the android app right now i'm just going to stay in the the web mode because it's easier to work with when we're styling but at some point when we need to we can also check out the the simulator in android studio okay so see there's a lot of you here and a lot of you been waiting for a long time i noticed a few you uh are in time zones to where it's like i don't know 2 am 3 a.m something like that i apologize for that i um i used to be able to stream earlier in the day to accommodate time zones especially time zones like if you're in india or or you know time zones in that area uh but unfortunately i have to work during that time period now so uh it's kind of hard for me to accommodate i guess if i waited till even later like towards night time here in my time zone uh i it would be maybe morning there's just not really a time that i can stream that would accommodate all time zones so uh let me know if this is a very awkward time for you and i'll keep that in mind uh but um i guess probably the best thing for me to do maybe is just try to do different times when i can so that you can always watch the recording but you know maybe sometimes you can catch it live if i switch up the times one other thing i wanted to to tell you all before we get started with the code you may have noticed that part two is no longer available so this is part four of a streaming series part two is not available uh so after trying to figure out what happened to part two my best guess as to what happened is that i accidentally deleted it so i'm very sorry about that i'm not i don't really remember deleting it for sure but what i do remember is that before the last stream like right before the last stream i was trying to set the stream up and i accidentally created the stream with basically like no scheduled start time which means the stream would be scheduled to start immediately and then i quickly realized my mistake and started a new stream uh tried to start a new stream with the same name that would have the correct start time and i wanted to quit that old stream basically delete the old stream so i wouldn't confuse people who were thinking that it would start immediately and um what i think happened is that i thought i was deleting that that stream that should have never been created but in reality i maybe deleted the wrong stream and i deleted the second one that's what i think happened and the reason i think that is because after i finished that stream which is stream three i went back and saw that the duplicative stream three was still there and it had never been deleted and um so i'm thinking maybe that's what happened i tried to contact youtube through the feedback like their feedback modal on um like creator studio is like the youtube um kind of like admin panel for um for creators i tried sending a message there i don't really know if they'll get around i don't know if they even would um put like recreate that video i know it's possible i've read online that it happened sometimes that they will recreate the video uh but i'm not 100 sure like free codecamp doesn't monetize so i don't know i don't know how google would view that if it would you know i've heard that they do it for large channels this is kind of a large channel but i don't know so we'll see i'm kind of expecting that that video will never come back so i really apologize for that um i mean i like i i tried to read everything i could and do whatever i could to try to get it back but it's i think it's out of my hands at this time so anyway uh that's what happened to number two i did have a few people ask about it so i figured i'd just you know let everybody know so let's go ahead and uh and get started and like i said we're gonna do some styling we may also add in maybe clean up the code a little bit if i notice somewhere where we could clean it up it's still very simple though we've managed to do everything all in one file but we do have some places where you know for instance we still have some commented out code you know this if statement is kind of pointless right since we're not doing anything else so a few places where we could clean things up you know i'd rather not ship unnecessary code if i don't have to so we'll be on the lookout for that but for now we want to do some styling which we basically did you know very very little styling you know up it to this point i don't even know if we have an object for styles no we don't okay let's do that first let's make that so in react native let me set my timer as well so i'm gonna set a timer for 25 minutes and i'll do code for 25 minutes and then when the timer goes off i'll go back to the live chat i'll answer some questions as many as i can get to and in a five minute time period and then we'll do a little bit more code all right so okay we we did import style sheets so maybe we have it somewhere i just don't know where are we using style sheets there we go i'm just gonna mix in there with everything else so when you're doing react native it's uh it's a good idea to use this stylesheet.create and to put your styles in here it helps as far as i know with what react native does behind the scenes it helps with performance so let's let's move our styles into our stylesheet.create object and then we'll we'll go from there so that'll clean things up a little bit get our styles all in the same spot so if i take this so this would be our our inputs it looks like all our inputs have the same the same styling so i should be able to select all of them yep and let's get rid of them and let's say style equals styles dot input and then up here in our style object let's create a key called input whoa didn't not mean for that to happen all right input and then let's paste oops i wondered if that was gonna happen since i i cut all of them but let's paste our styles into here okay now what we should get is our and let's log out so we can actually see this let's see if it'll there we go so see these now have the same styles and we cleaned up a decent amount of code here because we just move this into styles this works just like a normal style sheet with a few differences so a normal style sheet uses css syntax right this is javascript object syntax so you notice we don't have hyphenated uh properties here they're camel case so if you take your normal css properties and camel case them then they'll work and also we have no uh values in react native so there's no pixels at the end it's just straight numbers okay anything else is a string and we can also throw javascript in here which is is a pretty cool feature and then by default everything is in flexbox in react native and the flex direction by default is column whereas uh normally in on the web the default flex direction is row those are the main differences now react native uses a subset of css which means that you can't use all of what's available in css in react native but most of it's still available so if you if you try to do something that's not available you'll get a message in you know in your browser depending on what you're using uh whether a browser or uh an emulator or testing on a device at some point you'll get some warning to say that you know this one doesn't work at the very least you'll see on the screen that it doesn't work right so for now uh i think everything we're trying to do will definitely work okay so let's look through the rest of our app just to make sure we didn't miss anything no we didn't miss anything so right now let's add some styling to our our links here or i'm sorry our inputs here um the inputs are really close together which looks kind of weird so let's add a little little space between these so i'm gonna add uh let's add some margin and i'm gonna do margin vertical this is a little different you don't see this too often in css but in in react native with our style sheet we can say margin vertical and let's just give it an 8 and see how that looks now what this will do is margin vertical will add a margin on the top and the bottom at the same time so we end up with in between inputs here we end up with actually 16 pixels or 16 units right of uh margin and then at the bottom here we have eight so i don't sorry if it uh there's a little bit of a delay on the stream my computer's been doing this weird thing lately where every once in a while like i can hear my music like slows down and if i'm recording a video or streaming it just like stops for a second or two uh i haven't been able to figure out what's doing it yet um hopefully i can just maybe try restart and that'll fix the problem all right so i don't really like that much that much padding and to be honest with you let's uh let's give this a little mobile mobile view here so let's try to imitate a mobile view and see if we can get a right now it's showing this i wonder at device type all right cool so we can kind of see you know how this would look on a mobile device it's actually looks super small i think we can definitely make this stuff bigger wonder why why did it look so small uh did we have it on oh because i had it zoomed in a lot that's why so uh i definitely gonna take the zoom off of that at least on the on the desktop or the uh web version i don't know and my uh my timer stopped that's interesting i wonder if my stream freezing and my timer stopping or have anything to do with each other i guess i'll have to keep an eye on the clock now at about 5 30 eastern time or about a half hour into the stream i'm gonna take a break and go to the uh go to the chat all right so let's uh let's make these a little bit bigger well i want to make let's make the text bigger as well uh which i don't think we have any styles on the on the text so let's make style equals and let's say styles dot whoops heading i've been typing on a different keyboard all day for work so now i'm uh keep mistyping everything so we're gonna do for our our text we're gonna have the styles.heading oops nope and let's give this a font size of i don't know let's say 24 let's just see what that how that looks right all right a little bit bigger not too bad and um i kind of you know i want this to be kind of stand out a little bit more so let's do margin bottom uh we'll we'll give this a 16 for margin bottom oops forgot my comma see what that looks like okay a little bit better all right not bad and actually with more space there the spacing on these inputs doesn't look quite as bad uh also our inputs are you know i think they could definitely be wider like right now you can't even see uh all the content i wonder what would happen if we just comment out the width would it go full width okay it's it looks like maybe it's it's defaulting to some sort of you know preset width i guess i'm okay with that to be honest with you though i mean i think we could go like there's quite a bit of white space here we may want to you know go a little bit wider uh especially because the device id is is so large uh there may not really be a way to fit it in there but yeah actually if we went just a little bit wider i think it would it would work uh so let's figure out why it's getting this width and i'm gonna we don't need much space for the preview all right and i'm going to look over here let me make this just a bit smaller sorry if it makes it harder to see but i want to see what kind of styles we're getting here and if we go over to computed so if we look here and inspect the input right we're so we're on the input and if we go to computed we could scroll down it's in alphabetical order and we can go to with and see like all right actually when it's grayed out like this this doesn't mean that there so i want to make sure you can see it yeah you can see it i was afraid my my face was covering it up when it's grayed out like this it means that there's no width directly applied to that so i'm i'm guessing that this is just taking up the full space of its container so let's check the container maybe not so where it's interesting maybe maybe we'll get lucky and just find it in here i'm not sure it's just it's an odd number to default to right what was it defaulting to 152. yeah so that is odd and we can see there's not really it's not like the container is forcing it to be there this is the container right so the container is much bigger let's see let's see what we can do uh let's see if we can do some flexbox stuff here so if we do flex 1 flex 1 should stretch this out i was afraid it would do that um so it stretched it out the wrong way uh probably because we have it set um flex direction row that's why all right let's get rid of the flex all right um let's see all right youtube's telling me that the stream is not getting enough data let me check my connection that's weird connection seems all right let me know if uh if anybody's having trouble seeing this i'm gonna um oh yeah connection looks good maybe in about five minutes i'm gonna answer some questions so uh if you're in the chat right now asking questions and stuff hang in there for about five more minutes and then uh we'll uh we'll answer some questions here let's see i don't remember if you can do this in react native 100 i'm pretty sure it's not going to give us what we want but it's worth a shot hey it worked now it works now on the web i'm not 100 sure it would work on mobile but that definitely made things larger and i don't want it i don't want it to be that big so what we can do though is we can say with 100 but then we can also set a max width and we could see like you know what would we really want it to be like how wide is it right now 318 uh what if we said you know we really never want it to be more than i don't know 280. let's just see 280 see how it looks okay um we could probably go a little bit smaller since we have our device id there let's see if we can get away with like 260. okay 260. that gives us enough space for our number now the reason that these little icons are showing up is because i have lastpass and so it's showing up there these won't normally show up unless somebody had lastpass but in case they do we'll have a little space for them so we got enough space for the device id and certainly enough space for the email and password doesn't matter because it doesn't really show up anyway and let's see oops i really don't like that these are right up next to the edge of this uh so i wonder if we could do something about that let's see if there is let's let's go to our documentation for our text input and see if there's some way to get a little bit of padding in between um this uh maybe we could let's just see if padding will work that's worth a shot and then we won't have to go to the documentation let's just say padding uh horizontal and let's give it a four for padding horizontal let's see what it does cool all right that gave us a little bit of padding okay awesome all right so that works um it's looking a little bit better uh this button says press me that's not what we wanted to say um so let's change what the button says so we wanted to say uh maybe submit see how that looks submit looks good uh also you know maybe we could do something with the way the button looks and i think there's probably some builtin styling options for this button so we definitely could look that that up so let's check out react native button and let's see this reference here oh cool we have accessibility label we should probably add that accessibility label and this takes a string and we can just say submit i think that's pretty straightforward but what you know submit with me okay we could color the colors for the color of the text in ios or the background color in android i'm not gonna worry about that now i'll just leave it as the default i mean just for uh otherwise i'm gonna take a long time to figure out what color i want it to be so i don't wanna um i don't wanna do that we're not working on end end tests yet so i'm gonna leave the test id out and let's see what else we have okay it looks like there's nothing else built in in terms of uh styling just let's see uh it's not gonna show us i was hoping we'd get a preview of what it would look on different devices but it doesn't show all right so what we can do is add style on here so and this will be the last thing we do before i go to the questions our styles.button and we have another button actually so let's make sure we uh we add this button and why is it saying style can we not give a style to this button hmm maybe we can maybe that's it maybe we're stuck with this this style which is fine i want to keep this very simple and for the for the first release you can always uh add um add in better better styles you know later on all right so here we go so we have our inputs and our submit button slightly better look to it a little bit more space here and now let me go to the chat let's set a timer here and you know this this timer that i've been using it's the tomatotimer.com it's been just stopping out of nowhere the last couple of days i might switch it up and go back i used to have a different timer that i used but i forgot the url for it but may have to switch it up all right so i'm going to try to answer as many questions as i can if i accidentally skip your question you know just like ask it again or put it down in the comments and i'll try to get to it right so um i have some questions people a few people asking uh what is a brain computer app so brain computer app is just an app that reads your brain waves uh well i should say this it's a device it's a combination of a device and an app so this is the device i'm using it is called the notion brain computer it's built by a company called neurocity it's a startup company and inside of this is the same tech you'd find in a cell phone uh and or like an internet of things device you put it on your head it reads your brain waves and then you can send those brainwaves to wherever you want in this case we're sending it to our app and for this app we're keeping it very simple and we're just tracking the level of focus i believe it's the gamma waves in your brain give you a good indication of how focused you are so we're tracking the level of focus and if the focus drops below a certain level we're changing the color of the screen and we're making the device vibrate and so that's what a brain computer app is for this project i hope to do some projects in the future where we do other things with the data coming out of the brain but this is kind of a proof of concept just to show that we can reliably get data to a mobile device through a react native app i'm using react native and expo so this is kind of phase one project one of you know working with brainwaves and uh react native uh alex asks if this is gonna be posted on the channel after the live stream ends yes it will and i will not delete it this time see uh rudra asks what is a variable in programming um a variable is a little piece of data right that you can assign well it's it's something that you can assign data to okay uh so let me give you a i gotta have a variable in here somewhere right where's here we go so we have const notion is a type of variable called a constant that means that we can't change it after we assign it a value and we've named your variable notion and that notion notion holds the value of a new notion that we've instantiated with a particular device id all right so a variable could be a lot of different kinds of data could be just a string which would be like a word uh or a number right it could be an object it could be an array so there's a variable could be a lot of different things but at its most basic thing it's just something that you use to hold a value hey everybody everybody saying hello from different parts of the world how's it going uh arnav asked what my time zone is i am in uh eastern standard time so it's the east coast of the united states is uh my time zone so same time zone as new york city um that's probably the biggest city i think in this time zone let's see uh my tommy says did you really delete it i unfortunately i really did delete the second part of this this stream uh the second part of this series so uh very upset about that like i was honestly like i felt sick when i realized uh what had happened so i mean there's still some small hope that somebody on youtube will get my feedback message and uh and have mercy on on my mistake and and bring the video back up but i just um from what i read online i don't think they do that i think at some point in the past they used to do that kind of thing but i don't i don't think they do it anymore so um we'll see all right okay all right so i'm just looking through trying to find uh questions just still a lot of people saying hello so um all right someone says hello from brazil hey how's it going um someone uh pranav says how much money can we earn in react native depends on where you get a job from here in the united states a react native developer could most certainly get a job making um over 100 thousand dollars a year it's it's definitely not uncommon for that to happen um different parts of the world are obviously very different um and it you know different companies pay differently but it's it's certainly certainly possible to make to make that much which unless you're in like a very big city that's that's an excellent salary like from where i'm from there's not very many people that that make that much money so um react native can can make you a lot of money i was born in one of the poorest states in the united states which the united states is a pretty wealthy country so i guess it's you know it's not super poor but it's just you know i don't really know that many people that made that much money uh when i was growing up all right awesome i actually got through most of the questions uh so we'll go back and do some more code um the last another question just came in right when i said that and it was a react native versus flutter who wins in your opinion uh i um i really can't comment on that because i haven't actually built anything with flutter so i feel like i'm not in a good place to comment i really like react native it can do a lot of things i've heard good things about flutter but like i said i can't i think you could build awesome things with react native or flutter obviously if i had to choose something to build a project with right now i'd choose react native because that's what i use every day and i i know it um but if i didn't know either one you know i would definitely take a look at flutter and see you know maybe i would maybe i would use it all right so let's go back i'm going to try setting my timer again see if it works this time and uh let's go back in here and i want to submit and see what our styling looks like on the once we're like logged in in the logged in view and also i don't want to forget so i'm going to tell you all right now so you can remind me um the uh um red flash so we we put in a style where like the screen would flash red if your focus got below a certain level that when you first start up the app that red is like the default color so we don't want that to happen so i think i'd like to try to get rid of that as the default color so we'll take a look at our styles and see how we can do that but otherwise let's let's login and let's see let me grab my password cool all right so one thing i'm i'm seeing here is the focus text is quite small and it's very close to this log out button so i think what i'd like to do here is make this text a bit bigger and add a little space here between focus and log out and that's probably about it in terms of styling right so i said we're not it's not going to look very like really pretty uh but i want it to look like it's not broken or anything like that and uh let's see where's our style i keep losing my uh styles object well i guess we don't really we want to put a separate style on our focus text so because i don't want it to be quite as big as the heading so style equals and let's just i'm just going to call it focus focus text probably not the best name especially if we reuse this style if we end up reusing it we'll rename it to something a little bit more generic but for now i think that'll that'll work so let's say focus text and let's make the font size let's give it 18. okay that'll be nice nice and big for readability uh but then also not definitely uh like noticeably smaller than the than the heading and then let's give it uh let's say eight eight pixels on the bottom between the button and the focus text so we're gonna do a margin bottom of eight i keep saying pixels but when i i say pixels out of habit but i really just mean like units right whatever that translates to on a particular device okay all right that's that's better a little bit of separation there we can see what the focus is and um yeah let's see that looks good the only other thing i want to do is uh what do you think about this focus um right now the focus is a number between 0 and 1. do you think it would be easier for the user if they saw that as a percentage so instead of 0.23 if they saw 23 percent do you think that would be easier let me know what you all think uh in the chat uh it wouldn't be too hard to you know make that display as a percentage um and then it might be a little bit more obvious to say like oh i'm 100 focused i'm only 20 focus uh yeah let me know what you think looks like i got one yes for that nice okay um okay we got a couple of yeses cool let's let's do it all right so right now we are showing the focus here is just the raw data of focus um but what we could do is we could say like focus and we could multiply that by 100 and then we can add in a percentage sign and let's see see how that looks cool 23 see not not too hard um i don't know why 23 keeps coming up as the default like i have no idea maybe that's just the baseline that comes through maybe that's the last value that came through before i turned my device off last time i don't know um cool now you notice we still are seeing that flash of red every time we we restart so let's look at our styles and see how we have that set up uh so it looks like we're saying uh the background color we're saying if the focus is less than 0.2 or 20 and we have a user then display red otherwise display white now i don't know if this will work but it's it's possible that if we just switch these around maybe it would read the white first and we should be able to do that if we just say if the focus is greater we'll just flip around these values greater than 0.2 and we don't have a user then let's display white otherwise red i don't know if this is going to solve our problem but if there's some sort of solution that might work and it's very easy to try i'm always up for trying it and no that did not work at all that that is in fact the opposite of what we wanted how did i get the opposite um let's see and uh let's see sorry i gotta somebody's trying to say not nice stuff so um just gonna hide the messages okay all right so that definitely didn't work and uh let's see let's look so you guys somebody else is spamming a lot of messages so um there we go all right that'll clean up the chat a little bit sorry about that okay all right what the heck did i do here well let's go let's just go back because that's not what we wanted there we go there we go all right so that's better hmm oh let me see i'm gonna check the chat as well to see if any of you realize what my mistake was see aj says hey aj how's it going uh aj's one of the um uh cofounders of neurocity and uh who made this uh this device so the uh notion headset um aj says last value is that what i i don't know if he was referring to what i was doing here or commenting on somebody else okay um all right let's let me think for a second on how we could make that work i'd rather try to avoid the flash of red if we could but it's not like uh absolutely have to have let's see so actually if i reverse these colors and we get a flash flash of white maybe it would be oh now i know why i did that right because i said if we don't have a user now i confuse myself all right let's go back to what i did before so i know for sure i want focus if focus is greater than point two i want it to be white for sure there we go focus is greater than point two i want it to be white let's get rid of this for a second right and could we switch it yeah let's which is so folks greater than point you want to do white and then if user red all right this is a slightly more complicated thing but let's see if it works ah we still got the flash let's see if it'll happen if i save again will this happen oops if we save all right actually didn't happen let me actually change something and then we'll see all right we're still getting that flasher red i guess it doesn't matter uh now what this does is i just kind of split it up and added two kind of like two turn areas so um it's saying like if the focus is greater than 0.2 then we just make it white but if it's not then we go to the the right side of our ternary and then we check and see is there a user if there is no user us if there's no user then we do nothing which would make the default color um i guess nothing it would be whatever the default normally is which i'm assuming is just white or would it be red hmm i wonder if we even need to add white like what's our default without it let's um save that all right cool yeah so we don't really even need white so i'm thinking we could we could get rid of the white altogether because we don't need it and instead we could do these ends we'll switch the focus back to if focus is less than two all right we're still getting our um our flash of red that i don't want but we're able to get rid of our our white we don't need it uh two we do have what we could try to do instead is let's try this out well first i'm going to look at the chat and see if anybody has an idea all right it looks like no but uh here's what i'm thinking y'all can let me know what you think about this idea what if we take out all of this logic from here and instead in this use effect which we're already using to turn on and off the vibration we use this to change the color and we can set the color as part of state i don't know i think it's worth a try uh in which case let's go up here if we get any more state we might have to clean this up a little bit but for now i think this will be this would be fine and we can yeah let's clean this up here and let's say um let's say b g color set background color and we're going to go use state and the default background color is going to be white ffff and let's see let's use some typestrip stuff here i think we can say i'm using typescript but as somebody pointed out to me in the comments it's a typescript project but i'm not actually using types so let's see if we can uh use types here so what this is doing let's see if it actually is doing this yep so right now we're basically using typescript to say x can only be white or red we could add more if we wanted but for right now this can only be white or red and it's going to give us some cool autocomplete stuff which let's check it out down here so we can set the background set set bg color and oops now we're going to say we can either do white or red those are options so let's throw in the option of red and then we gotta set it back the other way right so if we're not if we are focused if we regain a certain level of focus let's reset this to white cool now down here we can just set our background color to bg color so if this works let's see if it works first if it does i think i kind of like that better because all the actions that happen when terms of a shift in focus are all located in one place and then we keep logic out of our styles so it looks a little bit cleaner and i totally forgot to look to see if this even changed did anything let's see sweet we got rid of that flash now we just have to see like did it actually work so i'm gonna turn on the headset and i gotta give it a second to turn on and connect right it's starting up it takes just a couple seconds to start up once it starts up i'm going to put it on and um see if we can get that focus down lower actually if it's stuck at 23 we can probably change it let's just let's cheat and just change it right here hey cool so we get red and if this was a mobile device it would be vibrating now let's switch it back and we get white cool so now the color is set all right and then the notion is uh it's starting up so i can see on my other screen i've got a dashboard up it's uh starting the operating system on the uh on the headset so it should be starting pretty soon and there's a lot going on in the chat so uh i'm gonna get back to that in a few minutes here yeah about five minutes i'm gonna get back to the chat all right that's cool um let's clean this up a little bit so if the user sell set user else um let's get rid of this else since we're not doing anything there and see if i think that was the only spot where we had unused code all right cool so we are connected now i'll put this on for a little bit so we can get some real data okay cool so we should be getting real data here uh i've got a an okay signal coming in oh goodness all right i just noticed something i don't know if you caught that on the screen but we we got a ton of decimal places out here so i don't want all those decimal places so let's let's make sure that we don't uh we don't have that and um actually that was kind of weird that that even came on the screen because we do have this two fixed two that's odd so set focus the number we're putting into focus is actually already with with two fixed so yeah we came up again very weird which i kind of don't want to show a bunch of decimal places anyway so let's just go ahead and uh add where are we at this focus um let's go dot two fixed uh you know maybe when we're multiplying it's it's messing it up and let's just see can we do two fig zero is that going to mess it up number not too fake returns a string representing a number interesting let's see if we can oops not on the end put that in the wrong spot there we go two fixed see if that works all right now we may or may not see that that number pop up but i'm thinking that since we're doing this after any calculation takes place then we'll actually get two fixed zero which means we will have no decimal places so that was cool i'm glad i put the headset on to see that that particular bug the auto formatting on that is a little weird but cool all right so am i i only got like another minute before i wanted to stop and go back to the channel what i wanted to do next if i had time was start to get this ready to to go to the app store so what i'm going to do is just kind of go through what we need so let's go to expo and let's see get started preproject documentation that's what i want so i'm using expo to help us build this uh react native app so we they have documentation for so some of the stuff that we haven't done yet is like the splash screen so it's just something that'll show up in the app and so we could add this into our app an app icon so we got to think about what we want to do for the app icon i'm i'm not really any good with any type of like photo or image editing stuff so i'll probably just find something online that like automatically creates all the icon sizes that we need um that'll be uh let's see walk through i know there's there was some documentation that talked about actually releasing stuff to the app store i don't know where it went there we go publish your app this will publish all right so there's a couple options we could do with publish um we could publish through uh through expo or could publish um like on my own server so i haven't decided what i want to do so that would be the first step and then we would actually deploy so i'm gonna skip the apple store for now and we're gonna go to android in the google play store and uh this is the next step of what we need to do so we basically are gonna run an expo command and it's going to bundle everything for us so we just need to make sure that we have our our app.json file sorted out and it has the right info in there and then i already have an account for the google play store so we should submit it like if we get the bundle right then we can submit it and um it says we can do it manually um and then we can actually just upload it straight from the command line which is pretty sweet once we do it manually the first time and i'll try to do as much as possible with this on a live stream i don't know if i'll do it today because i've been streaming already for you know over an hour but the next stream this is what we're going to be working on uh i don't know how long it will take to get approved but you know i'll let everybody know once it gets gets approved but basically that's these are the next steps that we're going to do and um really i think the hardest part at this point is just making sure that our app.json is looking good and figuring out what i want my app icon to be because i really have no idea um but i'll show you right now what our app.json looks like so right now it's just whatever was the default which it takes the name from with the name i put in when i started the project right so um i believe the icon is like the default expo icon in the same way with the splash so we can see like this icon is just the default that comes with the project it's blank same thing with the splash you know rather not have nothing there uh but at least like there's something there right it wouldn't it wouldn't throw an error saying it's nothing there um so yeah that's that's about it not really not much else left to do uh to actually deploy this so now having said that the only people that are really going to be able to use this or you know anybody that has one of these headsets i mean anybody could download it but they're not going to be able to get the brain data right so um it'll be a very very limited audience and after that there's other features i'd like to add to this uh and i'd like to have it a web version and an ios version so those are the next steps for now i'm gonna go back to the chat and answer the rest of the questions and uh let's see i guess so i'm gonna keep keep tracking my focus here while we while i answer questions right let's see let me figure out where i i left off at uh let's see um finding you says can you tell me the prerequisite of this course um i don't really know like what the uh um prerequisites would be like it would definitely help if you know a little bit about um react native uh i guess other than that you know you don't really need to know much uh in terms of like the brain computer interface like it's uh it just it has a javascript api so you don't need to know a lot about the internal workings of what's happening see let's see uh a question that says do you have a cat i do not have a cat no i don't i have i have four children and uh no cat i have the only pets that i have right now are two goldfish they're behind me oh let's see so there's a lot going on in the chat but not a lot of questions so i'm uh trying to find the questions all right so there's some some questions and comments based on the uh that red screen that kept uh coming up when we didn't want it to so thank you for all the the advice on there i mean uh so what's the app's purpose the purpose is to uh let let the user know when their focus is dropped below a certain level it's crazy you can see uh how much like trying to go through the questions and like move back and forth lowers my focus normally if i'm just coding my focus is a lot higher than this like more consistently but but trying to talk and read the chat uh really like i guess like diverts my my attention there's a ton of uh comments about hacking in here uh i don't know how he had on the topic of hacking in here but there's a i just keep scrolling and it's all this talk of hacking i'm trying to sift through all this uh chat to find uh any all questions here's a question are you using csharp i'm not using csharp in this uh and this application no this is all uh javascript well typescript technically and uh so it's typescript which uh actually i just recorded a typescript tutorial video last night i think i'm going to um put it on my youtube channel tomorrow so maybe tomorrow morning at some point tomorrow and uh so if you're interested in learning more about typescript check that out yesterday i released a video about documentation for javascript and it's not that long i think it's like less than less than 15 minutes or 20 minutes or so but if you're interested in that check out my youtube channel the uh the links in the description of this video and the typescript one i think the typestrip one will be pretty helpful i was thinking about rerecording it because i i made it when i was tired and i look really tired and i keep saying uh and um a lot so if i don't rerecord it and i just release it which i might just release it because i don't have a lot of time and i really don't want to spend a ton of time going over the videos because then i have less time for my family and i just overall put out less content but i recommend watching it at double speed because then it's not quite so annoying did i say uh and um i'm gonna try to work on that more maybe i just need to not record videos when i'm really tired because i tend to do it more when i'm tired but that video will come out it be recorded or in its current state it'll come out tomorrow on my youtube channel and i actually think it'll be pretty helpful based on what would have been helpful to me when i started with typescript that i tried to make the video in a way that i would have found helpful so if anybody's interested check it out uh i mean says what's the machine you're using uh i'm i'm using a pc so it's i i don't even know what brand pc it is but it's like windows 10 pc and where did i get it from i don't remember i don't think i got it from amazon i think i got it from like new egg or tiger direct or something like that oh okay i mean clarified i think i mean uh meant to say like what what device is in like this this headset device so this this is the neurocity notion headset and in the description i i spell it out too as well so you can check it out but this is a spring computer it is a brain computer or brain computer interface and inside of it are the same parts you'd find inside your cell phone and it can connect to wifi and it takes all your your data from your brain and then provides a javascript api so that you can link it up to your to your app or your website or whatever whatever you want to link it up to oh i mean also asked how much does it cost i i'm not sure what the cost is right now because i think they're working on another model this is it's kind of like a um like a testing device this is um i i don't know what you want to call it but this is like the first version just for developers to work on and it was a thousand dollars i don't know what the price is currently or what it will be when they start making more of these kevin says configuring a splashing screen in react native is as dangerous as eating the hottest pepper in the world why i hope i can do it sergey says in 2004 i created a calculator in basic i thought i'd become a superstar in the programming world but i only got older and i still make calculators actually in 2004 i made a calculator in c plus and then i didn't code for a long time after that but i did i do remember i don't really remember anything else that i coded in that class but i remember a calculator kevin says is python or java better i don't i don't really know in terms of better it depends on the application it seems like python has way more momentum right now whoa somebody's spamming the channel let's uh should we let me keep saying should we make app using pythons um let me get rid of let me hide these messages yeah please don't spam the channel the question is that was being spammed by at least two people that i see is maybe three people was should we make an app using python and um yeah if you want to that's uh it's it's entirely up to you python's a good language so if if you feel like that would be good then you'll go go ahead with it someone asked if they could be moderator uh i would mute people or spamming i was actually just thinking that it might be good to be to have a moderator it seems like the last few streams we've had more people spamming than than normal so um i'm going to think about it thank you for offering i'm going to see if if the next stream is is this bad with spam again then i think we'll definitely need to uh to have a moderator because it makes it really hard to for everybody and for me to read the chat and there's no need to spam you know i get to the questions eventually all right let's see i can't pronounce this name but it says can you learn a language in two weeks i don't know i mean if you already knew a few programming languages then maybe you could learn enough about another one to code but if you were starting from scratch and you had no idea how to code then i don't i don't know that you could really learn a coding language in two weeks uh amin says why did you start youtube um i i started doing youtube uh because i i wanted to share my work i was working at a university and i wanted to share my work with some of the computer science students there and see if they'd be interested in and helping out with with some of the work and i ended up getting a larger audience outside of the university and started you know catering my streaming towards them and then beau carnes from free code camp saw my live stream and invited me to stream on the free code camp channel and so that's that's why i got started and basically i keep doing it because i just hope that you know my streams would be helpful to someone else and um yeah so i don't i don't get any money from this this is all volunteer even on my own youtube channel i don't monetize you know if i at some point in future like maybe i think about monetizing like if i really wanted to produce a ton of content and do it as kind of like a parttime job i would think about it but for now it's all just volunteer and i just i like sharing information and helping people learn uh inside out says can you measure pre and post stimulant using this app for scientific proof actually that's kind of interesting i've never thought about knowing that before but that would be kind of cool to measure your level of focus at doing a certain task depending on what stimulants you would take like to see maybe if you had a lot of caffeine does that help your focus or does it hurt your focus that would be kind of cool to do um so i i would imagine you know you could probably get some good data on that you'd have to really make sure that you controlled all the other variables like noise and like time of day level of sleep like there'd be a lot of other variables that could kind of mess it up but if you did it consistently then i think it could be um yeah that would be kind of a cool experiment uh i mean as my inspiration my favorite goto resources yeah my inspiration uh for coding is like i just like coding and um i i love uh like when i hear that some a video that i've done has helped somebody like that's that's inspiration right i'm not gonna lie at first my inspiration to get into coding was i had a couple kids and a wife and i needed to pay the bills and this was a way to make money all right i mean i did like to do it but it was definitely like it was how i could get a good job to be able to provide for my family uh but now like in terms of keeping going with the youtube stuff is you know whenever it helps somebody that's that's provides me with more inspiration to actually do uh more content i know there's probably a lot of noise there's my kids playing upstairs so i'm probably i'm gonna try to end the live stream here in a couple minutes so i can go hang out with my kids before it's time time for them to go to bed um and there was i think there's a part two to that question oh your favorite goto resources uh when i was starting out i used free code camp a lot and did a lot of youtube videos and stuff like watched a lot of youtube videos now though i'd say like my favorite resources are just the documentation for what i'm using and stack overflow and mozilla developer network mdn i have a question how many programming language do you know slash understand um i mainly code in javascript and typescript i can understand coding in c sharp and i've i've worked with in the past java csharp python c plus plus i think what else see like i it's been so long since i've used those languages i don't really know if i could jump in and code anything in them right now but i could probably look at uh like a simple application and tell what was going on uh but i i wouldn't i don't know that i would say that like i know them you know but if i had to use them and had a little bit of time to get um kind of like get acquainted with him again i could probably code something i mean says do you already have a job yes i do i have a job i'm a senior software engineer uh at a company called dick sporting goods mh08 says this is only my second live chat with free code camp i learn stuff thank you for doing it oh you're welcome thank you so much for watching uh sergey has to go see you later sergey thanks for watching all right um all right i'm gonna i got through all the questions i think if i miss your question please put it in the uh comments below on this video i'm gonna wrap things up now and go go hang out with the kids for a little bit um if you uh if you liked the video you know please join us again for another live stream i'm gonna try to do this maybe uh saturday maybe i'll try to do another stream and uh check out my youtube channel the links in the description i just put out a new video yesterday and i got another one coming out tomorrow a tutorial on documentation for javascript and another tutorial on typescript and um feel free to follow me on social media links are in the description you can ask me whatever you want and i'll do my best to get back to you i mean coding related stuff is probably the best you could certainly ask me whatever you want but i don't know how helpful i'll be in other areas of life but anyway thanks so much for for all everyone's help all the the nice questions in the chat in the in the live chat i'm getting really excited about this project i can't wait to release it to the app store and that's going to be the goal for this weekend is actually get it submitted to the uh the google play store and uh that'll this will actually be my first app that i'm submitting to the store so that'll be that'll be exciting and i'm excited to actually do it live for everybody to see and uh hopefully then that will help you out if if you want to do your own apps but uh until then uh have a great day uh thank you so much and stay safe
