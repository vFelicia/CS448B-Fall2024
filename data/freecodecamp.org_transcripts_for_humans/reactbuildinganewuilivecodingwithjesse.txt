00:10 - hey everybody's Jessie and I'm gonna
00:14 - switch things up a little bit from what
00:16 - we've been doing the last two episodes
00:19 - all right so I want to work on some UI
00:22 - stuff so specifically when the let me
00:33 - bring it over what I've done so far just
00:36 - to give you just to get you caught up a
00:40 - little bit actually had I didn't have a
00:44 - ton of time to do work today because I
00:48 - had two phone interviews with candidates
00:51 - for a web developer job and actually
00:55 - went well so I'm happy about that
00:56 - but it did leave me with not a lot of
01:01 - time for this so what I've done since
01:07 - the last four since yesterday is I Trent
01:13 - change these into checkboxes and I made
01:16 - it to that they they work if you check
01:19 - them both you can see all both free and
01:22 - paid obviously or if you uncheck them
01:25 - both you can still see free and paid so
01:29 - it's the sorting works I'm sorry the
01:32 - filtering works this kind of works right
01:38 - now this is the materialized drop-down
01:45 - or select input to use this some
01:48 - JavaScript it needs to be initialized
01:50 - and right now I'm having trouble making
01:56 - it initialize after the API call comes
02:01 - back and it should populate this with
02:05 - our categories so basically it's
02:08 - initializing too soon and it's not
02:11 - including what we need so I'm gonna
02:15 - we're probably not gonna work on that
02:16 - today today I'm gonna worry more about
02:18 - this down here
02:22 - going to change these and instead of
02:23 - cards they're gonna be more like full
02:26 - width sections with an image over here
02:30 - and then some text with the option of
02:35 - having even more text you can click and
02:39 - it would expand and show more text there
02:42 - so this is all based on my last meeting
02:45 - with the people that I'm making the site
02:49 - for and that's more of what they want
02:52 - they're not really fans of this this
02:55 - layout so let me check the the live chat
03:00 - before we get started so say I hey
03:05 - everybody I see someone asks when to use
03:14 - react j/s and I'm not sure how to
03:17 - pronounce that name because there's no
03:19 - vowels in it well unless you count the Y
03:21 - at the end so it's certainty I'm not
03:30 - sure what you're asking about when to
03:32 - use react j/s so if you could explain
03:38 - that a little bit more I'd be happy to
03:42 - answer but since there's not a lot going
03:47 - on in the live chat right now yeah yeah
03:51 - the theme just reminded me that Y is
03:53 - indeed about it is I almost almost
03:58 - forgot that for a second but I'm gonna
04:03 - go ahead and just get started so I have
04:08 - on a piece of paper I have a sketch of
04:10 - what I want this to look like so I
04:12 - haven't converted that to anything else
04:14 - but so you won't be able to see what I
04:18 - really wanted to look like until it
04:20 - starts to take shape other than you know
04:23 - my brief description of it so I'm gonna
04:27 - move this over
04:30 - and I think I'm a right now if you want
04:37 - to follow along with the repo we're on
04:43 - the branch
04:45 - that's called resource sorting so I
04:50 - pushed before this started I pushed
04:53 - everything up to github so it should be
04:57 - up to date I think I may do this UI
05:05 - stuff on this branch don't know let me
05:09 - know if there's any objections to that I
05:12 - don't I think it'll work I'd hate to I'd
05:20 - hate to start a new branch for this
05:21 - since I these kind of are gonna go
05:23 - together yeah I'll just do it on this
05:29 - branch
05:36 - okay I did have a question about the
05:38 - animation I had a couple questions about
05:43 - the UI so let me just do that first
05:46 - since this this is all about the UI
05:48 - anyway it makes sense to answer some
05:50 - questions about it right off the bat so
05:55 - the first question from Thomas are you
05:57 - using one component for each card yes so
06:01 - it's this is a component separate react
06:06 - component and they're just populated
06:09 - with data from the WordPress API so this
06:13 - is separate component and at a question
06:18 - about the animation for the checkboxes
06:20 - so this this little animation here oops
06:28 - I guess it doesn't work too well when i
06:32 - zoom in but that animation actually is
06:36 - from the materialized CSS framework and
06:42 - it's it's pure CSS it doesn't take any
06:45 - JavaScript or anything so if you want to
06:48 - use that actually if you want to use
06:50 - this animation without the entire
06:52 - materialized framework if you check out
06:55 - my code pen which I don't even I don't
06:59 - remember what the link is to that I'll
07:01 - have to I don't know maybe I'll have to
07:05 - find it real quick and put it in but
07:06 - basically I made a version of this that
07:08 - works pretty much the same way that
07:10 - doesn't use I don't it's just pure CSS
07:14 - it doesn't use JavaScript you don't have
07:16 - to download the whole framework so if
07:19 - anybody's interested in that I will I'll
07:24 - put that link in the chat in the
07:27 - description let me know otherwise I'm
07:28 - gonna take the time and bother with it
07:34 - okay cool maybe I will find that link
07:38 - hey Bill made it glad you could join us
07:42 - bill
07:45 - okay Thomas maybe the animation for the
07:48 - card reshuffling yes so the the
07:51 - animation is using a JavaScript plug-in
07:56 - called masonry so this all does exist
07:59 - within one component called masonry so
08:02 - within that component I have all these
08:04 - other components for the cards but it's
08:05 - all wrapped in the one masonry component
08:08 - which I get to show you that here make
08:12 - this a little bigger there we go so
08:19 - within so you can see this is the
08:21 - masonry component everything Rhett is
08:24 - wrapped in that and then the cards are
08:27 - just produced within here so we had to
08:35 - do something cool was I think it was
08:41 - Fabien who did this pull request so I
08:43 - actually had someone submit a pull
08:46 - request that that perfected all of this
08:49 - because I could not get it working on a
08:52 - live stream the way I wanted it to
08:55 - so Fabien if you I don't know if he's
09:00 - joined in to the chat or not but he
09:03 - could probably talk even more about how
09:06 - this works well I have a lot of
09:13 - questions right off the bat it was okay
09:17 - so it's Anna's back hey how's it going
09:19 - glad glad you're back asked are you
09:23 - using git flow I'm not familiar with
09:28 - what git flow is so I'm assuming that
09:30 - I'm not using it
09:41 - okay you guys are hearing static let me
09:46 - see I'm gonna move my phone farther away
09:50 - because it could be from my phone I did
09:52 - have a fan on too but that's been off
09:54 - for a couple of minutes so it's probably
09:55 - not that if you're still hearing it
10:07 - Navan says hey i'm starting out a 100
10:10 - days challenge free code camp challenge
10:13 - from the 10th of July 2017 how do I
10:18 - start
10:21 - it's vital I think for the hundred days
10:26 - of code I don't don't correct me if I'm
10:30 - wrong but people just start whenever
10:32 - they want right you can just pick your
10:34 - own personal date and then usually
10:36 - people post that you know they tweet out
10:39 - with the hash tag like hundred days of
10:42 - code so I don't know is there somewhere
10:46 - where there's like a an actual date
10:50 - like an official start date for that I
10:52 - don't know okay so then I explain about
11:02 - git flow which I've actually never heard
11:04 - of so I'm really glad that you are
11:06 - taking the time to explain this to me
11:08 - so it says we get flow you create small
11:10 - branches for every feature and then
11:11 - merge them with develop I asked you
11:14 - because I have to learn it for this new
11:16 - project okay yeah so okay cool I mean I
11:25 - don't I guess I don't actually like
11:27 - consciously use that concept of git flow
11:30 - I do try to do feature branches though
11:33 - but a lot of smaller features I don't
11:37 - bother making a branch on so not I
11:44 - wouldn't say that I'd do that exactly
11:48 - okay so let me get I really love all the
11:52 - action in the live chat and everybody
11:55 - contributing but I don't want to
11:56 - disappoint everyone who who came here
11:59 - for the code and not just to hear me so
12:04 - let me go you know what I am gonna start
12:10 - a new branch for this because
12:14 - I'm gonna like I'm gonna change a lot of
12:17 - stuff in here so this is you this is
12:19 - gonna be major so I'm just gonna make
12:21 - another branch I'll merge them
12:23 - eventually but just in case I mess
12:25 - something up I want to be able to go
12:27 - back to the sorting and filtering stuff
12:29 - that I was working on and have that work
12:32 - and not have to worry about some UI
12:33 - thing delaying that so let me bring over
12:39 - my I have my terminal here I'll blow it
12:43 - up a bit sorry I'm a little distracted I
12:47 - always play music in the background and
12:49 - my headphones and just every song that's
12:53 - come up since I started it I haven't
12:54 - liked so it's really annoying the sorry
13:00 - about that so I just want to check make
13:04 - sure there's nothing on here oh wait
13:06 - there's something on here I'm not sure
13:11 - what I did I really thought that I had
13:13 - everything
13:20 - alright doesn't even show
13:29 - hmm
13:41 - all right so I'm not exactly sure what I
13:44 - did to be able to commit so that stinks
13:49 - when that happens I could do get Fred oh
13:54 - I guess I fixed it great so it must have
13:58 - just been a line or something that I put
14:01 - in that shouldn't have been there so now
14:03 - that I know that I don't have anything
14:04 - left on this branch I'm gonna take this
14:07 - branch exactly where it's at and copy it
14:11 - into a new one so if you're making a new
14:15 - branch you can do and someone was it
14:19 - bill I can't remember I think it might
14:21 - have been bill in a previous show told
14:25 - me that you can just do get check out
14:27 - and then - B and then name your branch
14:32 - and get and you'll automatically go into
14:34 - that branch which is awesome and save
14:37 - some time and prevents you from
14:38 - accidentally making changes on a the
14:41 - wrong branch so let's name this actually
14:46 - no I don't want to know the one that
14:47 - starts with resource so let's go new new
14:54 - resource you I I don't have a problem
14:58 - with long branch names because you end
15:00 - up never having to type them all out
15:02 - anyway you can just you know tab to
15:03 - autocomplete so why not have really long
15:07 - names so here we go so we're on this
15:11 - branch sweet new branches I just I like
15:15 - to go through that sometimes for those
15:17 - of you who are maybe not familiar with
15:18 - git so now that we're here I'm gonna
15:22 - pull this off to the side and now I can
15:25 - proceed to destroy this this component
15:31 - without fear because we can always just
15:33 - switch back to other branch so this is
15:37 - really gonna make me sad to remove this
15:40 - because this is just wonderful
15:42 - Fabian did an amazing job on this pull
15:45 - request and if somebody else did this
15:47 - pull request and I'm giving credit where
15:49 - it to the wrong person I'm really
15:51 - apologize for that
15:53 - but I'm pretty sure with Fabian
15:55 - and so I don't really need to I guess
16:01 - delete this right away because this is
16:04 - just a constant we're not rendering it
16:07 - yet but I need to come down here and at
16:15 - least start something where I want to
16:23 - put this let me uh I'm gonna pull this
16:29 - off to my other screen just quickly so I
16:30 - can see I think I want to try to do the
16:37 - new UI element right I'm gonna show you
16:42 - right here basically above this section
16:45 - so that these are still down there and
16:48 - like we can see the new ones I'd like to
16:50 - see them side-by-side and I still want
16:53 - this code right there for me to refer to
16:55 - easily so I'm not going to delete it yet
16:58 - it's just a matter of finding where that
17:02 - spot is this components way bigger than
17:04 - I would normally like a component to be
17:12 - okay so there's a search there's our
17:14 - tabs okay and here's where yep okay
17:19 - here's what we're inserting that so I
17:24 - can probably put a component in here and
17:29 - we'll just we'll test this out so what I
17:36 - want us to look like probably so I
17:39 - mentioned early I'm using the
17:41 - materialized framework so I'm gonna try
17:43 - to use their classes as much as possible
17:47 - so we don't have to do a lot of custom
17:49 - CSS and we'll see if it works and then
17:52 - if we need to edit it a bit then then
17:55 - we'll do that but it'll be a lot faster
17:56 - if we can use what's already built in to
17:59 - materialize so I'm gonna stick with
18:01 - they're calling classes I can use
18:06 - normally in react you have to use class
18:08 - name
18:08 - instead of class but I'm using a I
18:14 - always forget the name of it but you can
18:17 - check out the package.json file for this
18:19 - project on github and you can see it I'm
18:21 - using an NPM module that allows me to
18:26 - use just the normal HTML syntax I guess
18:30 - for for the HTML attributes so I can
18:34 - just use class so just wanted to say
18:37 - that in case it throws anyone off who's
18:40 - maybe used to react and that's a little
18:43 - weird to you so we're gonna use column
18:52 - s12 okay so since these are gonna be
18:57 - full with columns everything's just as
18:59 - siliceous means on a small screen size
19:01 - it's 12 columns and it's just gonna stay
19:03 - twelve columns on all screen sizes so
19:06 - within that we want to have an image and
19:14 - in text so I think what I want to do
19:22 - I think I'm actually gonna have some
19:25 - nested columns I mean that would be that
19:31 - would be the best here at least for now
19:33 - so I don't think I don't think I need to
19:40 - put this in a row and then more columns
19:42 - I'm just gonna try to put a column right
19:43 - in here I'm not sure what it'll do but
19:46 - it won't take long to test it out
19:48 - oops so let's do column and I want this
19:55 - to be should I make on a small stream I
20:01 - guess it can stack so we will do s 12 on
20:05 - a small screen but then on medium
20:06 - screens we want this to take up probably
20:11 - 25% of the screen
20:15 - we'll try 25% at first maybe I wanted to
20:18 - look slightly bigger than that but this
20:20 - should work for now
20:21 - and then within there we want to have an
20:23 - image and for now I'm just gonna put in
20:33 - just like a stock photo
20:43 - so my other screen I'm just gonna find a
20:45 - stock photo grab the URL and put it in
20:56 - so
21:02 - let's see if this one works
21:11 - and then our our next oops
21:15 - our next column is going to be where all
21:19 - the text is so we'll just put in some
21:20 - stuff here just so that we can get an
21:22 - idea of what it's going to look like
21:31 - just once again on small screens it's
21:33 - gonna be 12 oops cycling skills are not
21:40 - great today alright so we want small
21:43 - screens who want to be full with and
21:45 - then on medium screens we want this to
21:47 - take up the rest so this is gonna be
21:49 - nine columns materialise use just a
21:52 - twelve column system so as long as
21:56 - everything adds up to twelve then then
21:59 - you're good I guess you could go smaller
22:02 - than twelve if you want so you can't go
22:03 - more than twelve so within there let's
22:07 - just throw in just throwing something to
22:10 - see what its gonna look like and then we
22:13 - can adjust it later so I know we're
22:17 - gonna have a title and I don't know that
22:25 - I want H tags for everything else I
22:26 - think I'll just do spans and we'll just
22:29 - give them a class I want this to be
22:31 - author and let's just say it's me since
22:37 - I'm doing this right now and then I
22:43 - think what else what else do we have
22:45 - oh we have a type I'll just put that
22:50 - here for now I haven't decided for sure
22:52 - where we're gonna specify like what type
22:54 - of resource it is then we'll just say
23:01 - it's audio just pretend that I recorded
23:06 - an awesome song and that's the resource
23:10 - should be crazy I can't sing at all and
23:13 - then we'll just have a paragraph and I
23:19 - guess I'll give it a class oops
23:25 - that's not what I wanted we'll give it a
23:28 - class of the description and usually I'd
23:39 - like to give materialised comes with
23:41 - this this class called flow text which
23:43 - makes the the font size change depending
23:46 - on the screen width I normally go with
23:48 - that for text but I'm not for now I just
23:50 - want to see what it looks like without
23:52 - at first and if it's readable so for now
23:57 - I'm just gonna some lorem ipsum just
24:02 - because that'll be the fastest to do
24:06 - okay
24:07 - let's save that see what happens whoa
24:13 - and let me show you what happened this
24:16 - is - so since I'm using masonry on this
24:23 - it's just all these cars just covered up
24:25 - everything that we did so that's no good
24:28 - also my image that was supposed to be
24:31 - Bill Murray just didn't work so two
24:35 - disappointments there wow that's Thanks
24:42 - so here's what I'm gonna do I am gonna
24:45 - have to take these out to make this work
24:48 - so let's remove
25:12 - yeah let's just remove this and that
25:16 - should give us what we need just to be
25:18 - able to see what's going on okay so
25:27 - that's that's roughly really really
25:30 - roughly what I was going for but I
25:34 - definitely want to see what it looks
25:35 - like with an image so oh I see why is
25:40 - not letting me
25:49 - so as it failed to get the resource so
25:59 - this is where I was getting it from me
26:03 - say this was supposed yeah it's supposed
26:05 - to work
26:06 - oh wait maybe I needed the HTTP maybe
26:12 - this just needs updated because it it's
26:14 - without the s all right let's try that
26:16 - so I should just need to add this and
26:20 - hopefully it'll work no still didn't
26:23 - work
26:32 - all right one more time before I put in
26:35 - all right oh well I just have to put in
26:40 - an image that I already have and I know
26:41 - we'll work so let me check my image
26:44 - folder I think all these images in this
26:49 - folder are huge
26:50 - actually let me check the live chat
26:52 - maybe one of you are seeing what's going
26:54 - on here and can help me out also I
26:57 - haven't checked the live chat a couple
26:59 - minutes I don't want to leave you all
27:00 - hanging
27:11 - Oh Naveen asked about with that dot
27:13 - filter and map were so let me okay it
27:20 - looks like Rohan gave a good answer to
27:22 - that so so awesome basically it's just a
27:32 - way to work with arrays so that you can
27:37 - filter out and only get the items that
27:40 - you want from an array map lets you just
27:44 - go through every item in array and do
27:46 - something you know with each item so you
27:51 - would use it maybe like in place of a
27:53 - for loop
28:01 - I see a couple of people's told me to do
28:04 - get DIF to see what changed so I I
28:07 - eventually remembered that
28:21 - okay there's a discussion about code
28:23 - editors which I love it like I wonder I
28:26 - don't know that I've ever done in a live
28:29 - stream without some discussion of code
28:31 - editors in in the stream just always we
28:37 - had somebody so Shaw says hey what's up
28:40 - this is my first time tuning in how are
28:41 - you doing I'm doing pretty good thank
28:46 - you so much for joining in for the for
28:49 - the live chat welcome
28:51 - oh no Torrance says things were not good
29:00 - today was a bad day I'm sorry to hear
29:03 - that
29:03 - hopefully things will get better
29:08 - maybe I hope you have a good experience
29:11 - with it within the live chat maybe
29:13 - that'll be that'll be something me
29:17 - something that's not bad in your day oh
29:24 - I'm bear to asked about image size
29:27 - constraints and that's a good question
29:29 - at one time I did have size constraints
29:32 - but I don't think it would apply I don't
29:38 - think it would apply to where I put this
29:40 - in here I think I had them somewhere up
29:46 - here at least I thought I did
29:55 - now I don't remember where I put the
29:57 - image size constraints but it is right
29:58 - at one time I had the constraints I'm
30:00 - not gonna really need to have
30:01 - constraints like I did before for this
30:03 - layout which is one of the reasons why
30:06 - we decided to go with this layout oh man
30:11 - denna says what about cores so cross
30:15 - what is the cross origin resource what's
30:19 - the S stand for I can't remember
30:22 - cross-origin resource sharing is that
30:25 - what it is anyway that might be it
30:28 - actually since I'm doing this from
30:29 - localhost it might be freaking out and
30:32 - not wanting me to it won't want to give
30:35 - me the the image so all right yeah so I
30:42 - won't work with that I won't mess with
30:43 - the image anymore yeah actually I'm not
30:47 - getting a coarse error in the console
30:49 - I'm just kidding I'm just getting an
30:53 - error I mean usually it says oh wait
30:56 - here we go
30:57 - it was just higher up in the console I
30:59 - was getting multiple errors for it yep
31:01 - you got it you all are right it is a
31:03 - Corsair so let me switch and just get a
31:08 - different image there is a way that you
31:13 - can I forget what the site is there's a
31:16 - way you can get around course errors I
31:18 - used it I was building the weather app
31:23 - from free code camps lessons and I used
31:27 - it to get around the dark sky API course
31:29 - issues but I can't remember what it was
31:31 - so I'm not gonna try to find it now I'm
31:33 - just gonna go to unsplash and I'm gonna
31:38 - grab just an image from there this
31:42 - should give me a random image I'm gonna
31:45 - have the random image one
31:50 - and sometimes I like doing the random
31:54 - image from unsplash shot I T because
31:57 - then you you don't get bored hopefully I
31:59 - don't get a Corsair with this one yes
32:04 - okay no coarser great
32:06 - so I mean probably the ideal image
32:11 - dimensions would not be this but it just
32:14 - gives us an idea of okay we have an
32:16 - image here we'll see how it's gonna work
32:20 - all right so this is the basic layout
32:25 - that I that I want now but now that you
32:28 - all can see what I was saying in my mind
32:31 - what I want is I don't know that I want
32:34 - it to be this tall so maybe a little bit
32:37 - smaller and the images that would then
32:39 - be smaller this description would be
32:43 - hidden by default and you'd be able to
32:47 - click to read the description so maybe
32:50 - it just might say read more you'd be
32:52 - able to click and then it would drop
32:53 - down and you'd be able to see it so they
32:58 - would basically be half this the height
32:59 - of this but then every item would just
33:02 - take up space in this row potentially I
33:06 - don't know if I'm gonna attempt this or
33:08 - not but potentially if a screen was wide
33:09 - enough there would be enough space that
33:11 - we could do two rows side by side but I
33:14 - don't want to mess with that because
33:16 - then I have to worry about the the rows
33:20 - being the same height and I just don't
33:24 - want to deal with that I know that there
33:26 - are ways like using flexbox to make sure
33:29 - they're the same height but at this
33:32 - point I only have until the 20th of this
33:34 - month to get all the features done for
33:38 - this site so you can see I have a Trello
33:40 - board with all the stuff that needs to
33:42 - get done and it's linked in the
33:43 - description and there's still quite a
33:44 - lot so that's gonna fall under probably
33:48 - like hey we'll do it if we have time but
33:50 - it's not 100% necessary so you know for
33:55 - most people something would I don't
33:57 - remember what the average screen size is
33:59 - but this is probably closer to
34:01 - but a lot of people would be seeing the
34:06 - audience for this site is not likely to
34:09 - have really awesome
34:11 - computers with giant screens so I should
34:14 - probably keep that in mind that I think
34:16 - this the screen I'm working on now is a
34:19 - 2k 20
34:22 - I think it's 27-inch screen so
34:25 - definitely not what people would
34:26 - normally have who would be our audience
34:29 - but anyway this is the the basic thing
34:32 - so now we're just gonna fine tune it a
34:33 - bit I want to get the UI completely like
34:37 - ready how we like it before I actually
34:39 - pull in the data and then have a lot of
34:43 - them stacked up so I might just once we
34:46 - get it to a point where it looks pretty
34:47 - nice then I'll I'll just copy like three
34:51 - of them just to see what they look like
34:52 - stacked up and we'll probably do some
34:55 - sort of really thin border between them
34:57 - and if everything is good then we'll
35:01 - plug in the data and and see how it
35:04 - looks
35:05 - my only fear is that it's gonna be a
35:09 - long list there's gonna be a long scroll
35:11 - associated which I mean it's kind of
35:15 - unavoidable you know because this I'm
35:18 - kind of stuck I can't go back to the old
35:21 - layout I'm a little bit stuck and that
35:25 - it needs to be pretty much like this
35:26 - this is what they want but hopefully
35:30 - with all these categories and options
35:32 - and search anything can be narrowed down
35:35 - enough so that there won't be too many
35:39 - items here all right so I'm gonna
35:43 - continue on with this if you have any
35:44 - questions at this point if you're lost
35:46 - or there's something you really didn't
35:48 - understand about what I'm doing let me
35:50 - know right now oh I'm gonna take a drink
35:54 - really quick and then I'm gonna check
35:55 - the live chat before we move on and
35:57 - continue styling this
36:18 - okay so
36:22 - someone did ask about saying use
36:25 - classname so Jonathan said replace class
36:29 - with class name so I explained this a
36:32 - little while ago but maybe Jonathan
36:34 - joined in after that so just really
36:37 - quick
36:37 - you notice I'm using class here and I'm
36:40 - not getting errors it actually works I
36:41 - have a plug-in that lets me use class
36:44 - normally you can't use class with react
36:47 - but it's X it's really useful to be able
36:49 - to use it if you're copy and pasting
36:51 - HTML which in this case I do somewhat
36:56 - frequently from the materialised
36:57 - documentation so it's really helpful to
37:00 - not have to change class the class name
37:04 - so this was from some of the old code
37:06 - before I had that plug-in and I didn't
37:11 - install that plug-in someone else
37:12 - installed it so let me bring up I like
37:19 - to show this from time to time just so I
37:22 - can give everyone credit for their
37:24 - contributions so here's the contributors
37:30 - to the repo so I'm trying to think who I
37:34 - think it was Danny that actually
37:38 - submitted a request a pull request and
37:41 - installed that plug-in so thanks Danny
37:44 - for that so if you want your github
37:50 - profile featured on this show then
37:54 - submit a pull request how's this I don't
37:58 - expect anyone to take time out of their
37:59 - day to contribute to this project but if
38:02 - you would like to and you have the time
38:05 - then uh it's really nice I'll appreciate
38:08 - it and you know as long as it improves
38:11 - the project somewhat then you know I'll
38:14 - pull it in okay so let me let me check
38:21 - the the live chat quickly and then we'll
38:24 - move on
38:33 - ah raj area is says he's watching this
38:38 - in one 144p can't even read the code
38:44 - really sorry that you have to watch it
38:46 - in 144p so i'll if you're still tuned in
38:53 - and haven't just gotten frustrated and
38:54 - left I'll try to be as descriptive as
38:57 - possible and what I'm saying even though
39:00 - you can't see it that well that really
39:03 - stinks I'm sorry about that I don't I
39:07 - mean I don't think I could do anything
39:08 - about that it's it's you know the
39:10 - internet connection at the other end but
39:28 - oh man Turin tour I mentioned earlier
39:33 - that they're having a really bad day and
39:37 - I don't know if they want me to read off
39:39 - what they said so I'm not gonna read off
39:40 - what they said but it just seems like
39:42 - they're having a really really bad day
39:43 - so if you're still here I'm really
39:46 - really sorry I'm available on Twitter if
39:50 - you want to direct message me and if you
39:53 - need to talk about anything I'm here for
39:55 - you
39:56 - so that's things sometimes
40:00 - I myself have battled with clinical
40:05 - depression since I was probably 17 or 18
40:09 - I mean and I'm 31 now so I definitely
40:13 - understand when when you get down
40:15 - so I'm here for anybody that ever needs
40:17 - to talk about that or anything cuz it
40:20 - can be rough I'm not a counselor though
40:25 - so this is not like official medical
40:26 - advice or anything it's just somebody
40:29 - who's been through it so
40:38 - Danis Anton says will you cover setting
40:42 - up a register slash login not on this
40:44 - project I won't need to in this project
40:46 - but possibly on future projects I will
40:49 - need to do that so I can't guarantee I
40:51 - can't give you a time yet because I'm
40:53 - not entirely in control of my schedule
40:54 - it's whatever my bosses want me to work
40:56 - on so but I can definitely foresee in
41:00 - the future me having to do that on some
41:03 - some potential projects that I know are
41:05 - in the works so maybe one day
41:09 - potentially I could maybe just do a
41:11 - video like on my own channel pre record
41:13 - something to go over registration login
41:18 - maybe I'll add that to my list of of
41:22 - topics or potential topics for videos
41:27 - alright so I'm going to I'm just going
41:32 - to get started I know there's some more
41:33 - questions in the live chat I'll get to
41:35 - those later on if you're if you've asked
41:37 - a question and you can stick around till
41:41 - the end I'll answer all the questions if
41:43 - you can't stick around you could always
41:45 - I'll answer it you know you can watch
41:47 - the recording later on or you can
41:49 - message me on Twitter or put it in the
41:51 - comments and then I can get to it later
41:54 - on all right Dana Stanton asked what my
42:00 - channel is the link I have a link in the
42:03 - description for this video I actually
42:04 - can't even remember what the with the
42:07 - address is right now it's probably just
42:09 - my name but oh but it's in the
42:14 - description so okay here's what I'm
42:18 - thinking that we ought to do I kind of
42:21 - think this title is just a little bit
42:23 - too big so maybe I'll drop this down
42:26 - into an h4 it's an h3 right now so we'll
42:29 - drop this down to an h4 these need to be
42:32 - on two different lines and it might be
42:36 - maybe I might want them to be a
42:38 - different color we'll see well mess with
42:41 - maybe making them this red color also I
42:44 - have this kind of goldish color that
42:48 - might work we'll see how sometimes the
42:50 - gold
42:51 - there isn't really that readable so
42:53 - we'll see but it might work I think it'd
42:56 - be nice to have at least one of these be
42:58 - different color and then we'll have to
43:01 - hide this and then put in a little
43:03 - button that will show it and we'll
43:07 - probably want to do some sort of
43:08 - animation so that it looks just a little
43:12 - bit more smooth maybe not even I mean we
43:14 - might just do like a little transition
43:16 - or something
43:17 - nothing fancy I think that's that's
43:23 - probably it also will probably want to
43:25 - do something with a salmon suit right
43:28 - now the the height of this is obviously
43:31 - being set by the image right so if I
43:34 - want this to be shorter what I ideally
43:36 - what I want is the height of this to not
43:38 - be set by the image but instead to be
43:40 - set by the text so we'll have to adjust
43:45 - the styles for this image so that you
43:49 - know it isn't always taking up this full
43:52 - height here and then finally we're gonna
43:55 - have a little border probably web you
44:00 - know like a bottom border alright so
44:03 - that's the that's the plan right now so
44:05 - let's go back to the code so first
44:09 - things first let's drop this down to an
44:12 - h4 also we need to make something in
44:19 - here linked so potentially the title
44:22 - could be a link so I'm gonna just make
44:25 - it a link right now and I just want to
44:33 - see what color it makes this link
44:35 - automatically I think the default right
44:37 - now is blue I don't want the title to be
44:40 - I don't think I want the title be blue
44:42 - we'll see what it looks like but it's
44:44 - really not a part of the color scheme
44:46 - for this so we'll probably end up making
44:48 - it maybe this red color and then yeah I
44:56 - want this to be
45:03 - oops not class style and now if you're
45:08 - not familiar with how to do Styles and
45:10 - react one way to do it is to put it in
45:13 - line as a JavaScript object so in react
45:17 - when you're in this is called JSX
45:20 - this kind of HTML looking stuff in here
45:23 - so if you want to put JavaScript in the
45:25 - middle of it you just put it a little
45:27 - curly bracket and then now anything
45:30 - between these these first curly brackets
45:31 - is JavaScript so now that I've put
45:34 - another set of curly brackets that's
45:35 - just an object and so within that object
45:38 - we can put CSS attributes but we have to
45:47 - camelcase them so for instance if we
45:52 - wanted to put like font weight we'd have
45:56 - to do it like like that instead of the
46:00 - normal hyphenated CSS selector okay so
46:02 - this is just one way to do it there are
46:04 - many different ways to do CSS in react
46:06 - but this is just one so for this one I'm
46:10 - just gonna do color and I need to grab a
46:15 - hex code so I'm just going to pull on my
46:18 - other screen I'm gonna pull up dev tools
46:21 - just so I can grab that same color that
46:24 - is in the footer and that's the hex code
46:29 - we're working with so you want to make
46:31 - sure that you put in in this case I'm
46:34 - using single quotes but you could
46:35 - probably use double quotes and it
46:36 - wouldn't matter
46:38 - you know the actual value of the
46:40 - attribute you want to put inside quotes
46:43 - if you just have just a plain number it
46:47 - will probably work without the quotes
46:48 - but I just put everything in quotes for
46:50 - consistency if you wanted to do
46:52 - something else you just put a comma and
46:54 - then put another attribute and you could
47:01 - just go on just just like you would
47:03 - normally do a JavaScript object so let's
47:05 - what else did we want to do oh we wanted
47:08 - to make these actually mean let me see I
47:12 - if I do oops not distribute
47:19 - display:block I think this will make the
47:23 - other thing pop down on to a separate
47:25 - line so we wanted to do that so we've
47:28 - made that a different color let's just
47:30 - try out that gold color I don't really
47:33 - have much hope that it will work I think
47:36 - it's gonna end up being too hard to read
47:38 - but we'll give it a shot
47:40 - so let me grab the gold color once again
47:49 - on my other screen just from dev tools
47:54 - okay so that's our gold color and then
47:57 - for this
48:07 - let's go display:none for now oops and
48:16 - then finally for the image let's go with
48:26 - I'm not sure what is the one right now
48:39 - I know for sure I want the height to be
48:43 - Auto but I'm not sure that'll fix our
48:46 - problem right now because if the width
48:51 - is said yeah we'll see I'll just leave
49:00 - it for that now I'm I'm doubtful that
49:03 - that'll fix it but yeah and it's true it
49:07 - didn't fix it but let me see what this
49:08 - did let me show you show you what this
49:10 - did okay so as I thought blue is the
49:13 - default color for a link I don't think
49:16 - we're gonna keep blue I mean you you you
49:18 - all can tell me what you think but I
49:20 - just don't think that this color blue
49:22 - really goes with the color scheme as you
49:25 - can see you know we're kind of that like
49:26 - a black black you know this dark red and
49:30 - white and then I really only kind of
49:33 - accent color that we've used as this
49:35 - gold
49:35 - this actually is way more readable than
49:38 - I thought it would be so I think I might
49:42 - keep it I was worried it would be hard
49:44 - to read I'll have to try it out on maybe
49:47 - some screens that aren't as
49:48 - high-resolution just to make sure
49:50 - but for now I'm okay with that I
49:54 - definitely want to change this color and
49:57 - I think make it the red color and I
50:01 - don't know that I like these being two
50:03 - different colors so maybe this will be
50:07 - this will either be red or the the gold
50:12 - and then the other two will be the
50:14 - opposite color the paragraph will end up
50:17 - being just the regular font color which
50:22 - i think is black with an opacity of 87%
50:28 - okay so I'm gonna open up dev tools and
50:31 - I'm gonna inspect this really quick so I
50:33 - can see what's going on with the image
50:36 - and let me bring it over so I hate to do
50:41 - too much on the other screen where you
50:42 - can't see wow that's an issue
50:47 - check check that up
50:52 - that's just going right over so we
50:59 - definitely don't want that I'm not sure
51:01 - maybe this is because we tried to nest
51:03 - columns and maybe that's not the right
51:05 - way to do it so I'm not gonna worry
51:07 - about this right now we'll wait until we
51:10 - do a bit more but we'll have to fix that
51:15 - but I did want to see yeah I kind of
51:18 - like how that stacks it's not not too
51:20 - bad but let me make this a lot bigger
51:26 - for you all here's our image and we can
51:34 - see in dev tools all the properties here
51:38 - what I'm really worried about here is
51:40 - width and height so I'm assuming that
51:43 - the width is set to I don't know what a
51:49 - hundred percent maybe the width not set
51:52 - at all it doesn't look like it's even
51:56 - set so let's just you know let's play
51:59 - around a bit and see what we can do oops
52:06 - I can't
52:15 - okay so if we set it to a hundred it
52:17 - actually looks better here but it's not
52:19 - gonna look better when we make it bigger
52:20 - so it's gonna look worse okay so we
52:23 - don't want it to be a hundred I actually
52:24 - want the images my idea for images is
52:28 - that all the images will be in this
52:30 - upper left-hand corner and then whatever
52:33 - their normal sizes they'll remain that
52:35 - size unless they're bigger than I want
52:38 - in which case though they'll have to be
52:41 - a maximum size so it'd be something like
52:44 - max width would be a hundred percent so
52:53 - I would never want it to be you know
52:56 - bigger but potentially could be smaller
53:02 - so maybe really I could probably set I
53:14 - could set a maximum height because we'll
53:23 - know as long as the titles don't get
53:28 - huge I mean four it would have to be for
53:33 - each break point we would have a
53:34 - different maximum height
53:40 - but I'm gonna think about what I want to
53:43 - do there for now let's sort this out
53:47 - with kind of what I said a few minutes
53:51 - ago and get that looking how we want it
53:53 - to look and we need a border here and
53:56 - then I'd like to duplicate it a few
53:58 - times to see what it looks like stacked
54:01 - and then also we need a button to show
54:05 - that that description all right so we'll
54:08 - work on that now actually let me look
54:14 - let me check back in with the live chat
54:16 - because it's been it's been a few
54:20 - minutes I don't want to miss too much
54:25 - okay yeah danish anton subscribed to my
54:30 - mind chant my personal channel so thank
54:32 - you thank you for that i don't want i
54:34 - haven't been able to put up as many
54:35 - videos that i had planned
54:37 - I'm just been busier than I thought so
54:39 - sorry about that but I hope to put up
54:42 - some some nice you know short tutorial
54:44 - videos on there as soon as I can
54:57 - alex says materializes to puck and
55:00 - bootstrap is biggie so if you're
55:03 - familiar with 90s American rap feuds
55:08 - then you'll know what that refers to but
55:12 - I think everybody knows Tupac and Biggie
55:16 - right if you don't there are just two
55:19 - famous rappers that had feuds which may
55:24 - or may not have been legit I always have
55:27 - my doubts about celebrity feuds I think
55:29 - most of them are orchestrated to
55:32 - increase publicity but I did I never
55:39 - took sides in that phew
55:49 - okay bill says the trick I've heard is
55:52 - if you make everything monochrome with
55:53 - an overlay using maybe Photoshop and
55:56 - can't read something then the design
55:59 - colors might need to be changed cool
56:01 - I've never heard that that's that's a
56:02 - good good trick
56:07 - Rogerio says I know nothing about next
56:09 - Jay asks would you mind tell me in short
56:12 - what it is what it's about and actually
56:16 - it's some people and the live chat gave
56:19 - some good answers to that just my short
56:24 - answer to next jazz is it's a way to
56:27 - very quickly start building with react
56:31 - and have server-side rendering built in
56:34 - routing built in so you don't have to
56:36 - set that up you don't have to worry
56:37 - about setting up web pack comes with hot
56:40 - module reloading so you can very very
56:43 - quickly start using react without having
56:46 - to learn a lot of the other stuff that
56:48 - at least in my experience slowed me down
56:51 - a lot at first so there are plenty of
56:55 - other awesome things about next Jas but
56:57 - for me at least this that's kind of the
56:59 - core of what's what's great about it
57:10 - okay so Alex is the blue is not working
57:13 - I definitely agree
57:22 - Alex asks about how how I got my code
57:26 - editor to show the color of the hex so
57:28 - this is I'm using Adam from github and
57:31 - it's just a plugin I don't remember I'm
57:34 - sorry I don't remember what the plug-in
57:36 - is but it was just a plugin for the code
57:40 - editor to show the the colors
57:52 - as anna says if they had a color scheme
57:55 - to stick with at least you could blame
57:56 - them if it didn't pass an accessibility
57:58 - audit yeah that's true I really have no
58:03 - control over this color scheme at this
58:04 - point so this was the color scheme that
58:07 - I inherited when I took over this the
58:11 - development of the site so a lot of
58:13 - decisions had already been made if
58:15 - you've been watching from like the start
58:17 - of this when I started this site there
58:19 - was already a partially completed site
58:21 - that I was starting from and I had to I
58:24 - didn't have to keep all of it but I did
58:27 - have to keep some of the design elements
58:29 - and the color scheme I definitely had to
58:33 - keep
58:41 - all right so I've got through everything
58:46 - in that in the live chat for the most
58:49 - part so let's get back to this okay
58:56 - l-o-l Brito says Adam the Adam package
59:00 - is called pigments for the hex colors so
59:02 - thank you very much for for putting that
59:05 - in the in the chat so if anybody's
59:07 - interested in getting their getting
59:11 - colors here pigments is the package for
59:14 - Adam I'm sure there are similar packages
59:16 - for other code editors so let's change
59:19 - that that color and let's see I'm just
59:29 - gonna copy this since this is pretty
59:31 - much what we want I don't need this part
59:38 - though just copy that and I'm gonna use
59:48 - this color here I also want to increase
59:53 - the font size of both of these
60:03 - as these start to get bigger in terms of
60:07 - you know adding more CSS in this I like
60:11 - to put them down in here in this style
60:16 - JSX tag so at some point I'll probably
60:19 - do that but for now it's just a lot less
60:21 - scrolling and it's probably easier for
60:23 - you all to see if I put it in here so if
60:26 - it gets really huge and unmanageable I
60:28 - will move it down but for now I think
60:29 - it'll be fine so let's go with font size
60:34 - and I'm not sure what font size we have
60:36 - now but I think I'm gonna I'm gonna see
60:38 - what 18 pixels looks like oops if I can
60:44 - type 18 there we go let's put it here as
60:52 - well might look nicer if these are a
60:55 - little bit different but for now we'll
60:57 - just try it also we need a button right
61:01 - so I'm not sure if I want an actual you
61:07 - know button or just some text for now
61:10 - it'll be easiest to just put some text
61:18 - we'll just say give it a class of read
61:20 - more for now and I'll just say read more
61:29 - and I guess we could do you give it an
61:36 - on-click
61:45 - in
61:55 - I was just thinking for a second if I
61:56 - could fit everything I wanted this to do
61:58 - right into here if I should just make a
62:00 - different function we'll see I don't
62:09 - have to think about it right now
62:12 - for now though I just want to hmm I
62:23 - think how I should how a lot to do this
62:25 - I guess I'll have to say that right now
62:27 - so we're just doing the u.s. stuff right
62:29 - now so I shouldn't I shouldn't be mixing
62:31 - in this this stuff of right now it'll
62:35 - just slow us down
62:37 - let's see we wanted finally we wanted a
62:44 - a border right so what his style and
63:01 - I'm gonna do a border bottom and let's
63:03 - do I want it to be really thin so I
63:06 - think I'm just gonna go two pixels at
63:07 - first see how that looks and we want it
63:10 - to be solid and I think I would like it
63:13 - to be some type of gray maybe I'll just
63:24 - use
63:33 - whenever I need to make an RGB color
63:36 - instead of typing it out myself I just
63:38 - come in here and I think if I made it 54
63:43 - I can change it but basically if I do it
63:50 - like this then I don't have to type it
63:52 - up and I can preview the colors so
63:56 - occasionally it saves me some time so
64:00 - let's put that in there and I'm gonna
64:04 - try 54 let's see how that looks
64:18 - oops well alright so we had the border
64:24 - didn't do anything at all right now I
64:27 - don't need that in there also I need to
64:32 - make this
64:44 - okay there we go
64:46 - while two pixels this way - that's way
64:49 - thicker than I wanted we're gonna have
64:51 - to go down to one pixel actually I don't
64:56 - really mind this right now at least we
64:58 - in the same color I think they may be
65:00 - you should be closer to here so we need
65:02 - to decrease the padding for that title
65:05 - tag and then we need to increase the
65:10 - padding between these two because the
65:12 - serene more should be down here the read
65:14 - more right now it doesn't indicate at
65:17 - all that it's clickable so we need to
65:19 - make that have a better indication of
65:22 - click ability and we'll make this
65:27 - smaller so let's drop this down to one
65:29 - pixel and let's say
65:42 - we did it padding-bottom I think it's
65:45 - patting your nut margin we'll find out
65:47 - in a second here oops padding-bottom and
65:56 - we'll do let's see if eight pixels will
66:02 - be too much okay so that thickness there
66:09 - that I like that that's not too bad I'm
66:15 - not I'm not sure that I like it being
66:17 - all the way across like that I don't
66:19 - know if it needs to be we'll see how it
66:21 - looks though whenever we get more on
66:22 - there maybe it'll look better so that
66:25 - padding didn't do anything so maybe it's
66:27 - a margin thing it is it's a margin oops
66:38 - and I put it I actually put it on the a
66:42 - tag which which wouldn't do anything
66:47 - anyway all right so let's take this
66:55 - take this off and on the actual H tag
67:08 - will do margin-bottom and we'll try
67:11 - eight pixels
67:21 - I'm not sure that did much of anything
67:24 - did it yeah that's so the exact amount
67:37 - all right let's try oh it's not why is
67:43 - it not doing anything
67:57 - that's odd
68:06 - all right we'll drop that down then a
68:10 - half I guess
68:17 - okay all right that brought it up a bit
68:20 - I guess it's okay
68:32 - let's share this font size and then we
68:36 - brought it up to 18 but I think 20 might
68:41 - be even better yeah like 20
68:56 - all right so I must have the worst
68:58 - Spotify playlist ever playing right now
69:01 - on my headphones I normally don't mess
69:04 - with Spotify at all during the streams
69:06 - cuz but I have to change this it's just
69:10 - it's just not it's the new music Friday
69:13 - playlist for this Friday on Spotify and
69:16 - it's just not great today so I'm gonna
69:19 - change that all right let me I'm gonna
69:28 - check the live chat since it's been a
69:31 - while okay not much going on in the live
69:35 - shows I haven't missed that much Oh
69:42 - Alex said that Adam always crashes so I
69:45 - had to switch back to sublime so that's
69:48 - things I've never used sublime I've seen
69:52 - people on YouTube using sublime it it
69:55 - looks like a nice code editor okay
69:59 - Sebastian says color highlighter works
70:02 - for sublime so if you're using sublime
70:03 - and you want the hex colors color
70:05 - highlighter it will work
70:15 - yeah bill Cicero music really throw you
70:18 - off your game for sure I like it just
70:23 - makes it so much harder to focus when
70:26 - the music is annoying to you jack says
70:31 - Jessie sounds like Evan Peters to me now
70:34 - I can't separate the two of them in my
70:35 - head I don't know who Evan Peters is
70:38 - who's Evan Peters does not want to
70:43 - listen to them and see if he sounds like
70:44 - me all right so let's go back and see
70:53 - what else we need thought we need to
70:57 - work on this read more hmm
71:04 - well for sure the read more needs to be
71:07 - a different color I'm running out of
71:11 - colors of highlight colors I guess I'm
71:15 - gonna have to make this one red well we
71:23 - don't really have any other colors that
71:24 - are already being in use unless
71:26 - something to go back to the blue or pull
71:28 - in some entirely different color so
71:31 - we'll make this red we will make it so
71:34 - that your cursor looks like a link
71:36 - cursor so let's do that
71:52 - okay so you want the color to be I
71:57 - couldn't just copy and pasted this whole
71:59 - thing here oh wow and cursor cursor
72:10 - pointer this has been the most CSS heavy
72:12 - stream I've done for a long time so if
72:16 - you were here for a lot of JavaScript
72:18 - sorry but I know a lot of people really
72:21 - wanted more CSS stuff at least a while
72:26 - back there are a lot of people that
72:27 - wanted more CSS that were kind of a
72:31 - little lost with all the react stuff so
72:33 - hopefully some of them are watching and
72:35 - are getting something useful out of this
72:38 - all right so this is more like what we
72:40 - want oh we wanted to add some padding
72:43 - there so let's do this we'll do a margin
72:52 - margin top let's dress 16 pixels and see
72:58 - what that looks like
73:06 - that's weird didn't do anything
73:12 - this didn't look like anything
73:22 - that's weird
73:29 - nice because it's not yeah I didn't set
73:33 - it to display:block that's my fault
73:35 - okay that's better yeah I don't know if
73:41 - it needs to be 16 but for now that'll
73:46 - work
73:56 - okay I wondered I guess it's not it
74:03 - looked like this was indented a bit but
74:04 - I think it's just because it's a t just
74:07 - looked indented which I didn't I don't
74:09 - want it to be indented so I don't know I
74:15 - don't know that I like audio being here
74:26 - maybe I'll have to think maybe there's a
74:29 - better place I think it might look nicer
74:32 - if it was title and then author and then
74:39 - this was somewhere else so I wouldn't I
74:49 - actually wouldn't even be opposed to
74:50 - using icons because our options are
74:56 - either going to be video text or audio
74:57 - you know we could definitely find pretty
75:00 - straightforward icons for each one I
75:06 - don't know if I want to go through
75:08 - finding icons right now it's not I guess
75:13 - it's not that difficult okay all right
75:20 - at this point I think I would like to
75:23 - see what a few of these look like
75:25 - stacked together so let's try that
75:29 - before we get any further
75:43 - oh man okay that looked terrible at
75:48 - first but it's just because the images
75:49 - didn't load
76:05 - that doesn't look too bad was everyone
76:08 - thing actually looking at right now I
76:15 - think the image section could be larger
76:20 - there's a ton of space over here
76:29 - you know we have multiple ones I could
76:31 - just try to you just change one of them
76:36 - and see what it looks like compared to
76:38 - the other ones so we can make this 4 and
76:42 - this 8 and then we'll try a different
76:48 - one so we'll make this 5 and this 7 and
76:54 - then we'll leave the other one as it was
76:56 - just to get an idea ok so let's see
77:06 - we'll have a vote
77:09 - lay out 1 2 or 3 or none of them and do
77:17 - something else now we will these are a
77:20 - little bit short so I guess you know the
77:23 - title is gonna probably gonna take up a
77:25 - decent amount of space so maybe it would
77:30 - look better if if it was actually filled
77:32 - out I'm gonna do that for this one as
77:37 - well so I'll give everyone in the live
77:40 - chat a minute to to add weigh in on this
77:43 - decision if you can if you want to and
77:48 - I'll I'll put in some more data
78:28 - okay
78:37 - it just occurred to me I don't know why
78:39 - I just occurred to me that I ought to
78:41 - actually put like author : and then have
78:44 - something here so that people will know
78:47 - that it's the author
78:57 - actually this doesn't look nearly as bad
79:00 - now that it has a longer and longer
79:03 - title I'm gonna check the live chat see
79:10 - what you all think
79:59 - okay Patrick says we could stagger the
80:01 - images left and right bill likes the
80:05 - stagger idea Sebastian says too much
80:07 - space maybe more spacing between the
80:12 - bottom border and next section Andrew
80:20 - likes number one layout one manish says
80:31 - none of them it's too much space rohan
80:36 - says three looks best but also a
80:39 - vertically center the text blog Phillip
80:42 - says way too much space on all of them
80:44 - Sebastian says Center the image inside
80:47 - of the div if possible Phillip says
80:50 - there's a lot of margin on the right of
80:52 - the image patrick says plus one for
80:55 - author label Genesis I think you need
81:00 - some margin top on the border okay cool
81:08 - all right so if we vertically center the
81:12 - text that'll take care of the margin top
81:16 - thing for the most part unless we have
81:21 - something with insanely long title that
81:23 - rats so let's do that first
81:33 - so let's see if we take
81:54 - let's take this and make it give it a
81:56 - class of feline rapper and then no wait
82:03 - I don't want that to be I want this to
82:08 - have the class of v-line rapper and I
82:13 - probably could do it for all of them so
82:41 - okay and then within this we can make it
82:52 - V line
83:05 - all right let's see if that works
83:07 - so materialized comes with some vertical
83:11 - alignment stuff built in that's really
83:14 - helpful because you don't have to mess
83:15 - with it so here's what it looks like if
83:17 - the text is vertically aligned
83:33 - okay they were saying the image almost
83:36 - sits on the border yeah you're right we
83:38 - need to do something about the image
83:45 - actually let's try this the image
83:49 - there's no reason the image couldn't be
83:50 - vertically aligned as well I'll shut on
83:58 - this one first and then what if we set
84:04 - the height to always be no I don't know
84:09 - if this will work but we'll see let's
84:13 - see
84:14 - I might need I might need to use
84:19 - something more absolutely yeah that's
84:21 - not going to work
84:49 - to see if this would work
84:54 - okay so the vertical alignment would
84:57 - work but yet we still need some sort of
85:04 - padding because potentially if it was
85:08 - this small it would be it would come
85:12 - right up there
85:14 - so actually we could probably just do
85:20 - give this section this whole section a
85:24 - bit of padding yeah let's do that
85:32 - okay so let's just do do these big
85:43 - sections here and we'll give them give
85:47 - them awesome padding
86:01 - oops
86:12 - let's just give them a little padding
86:15 - for now see how that looks
86:26 - I don't know I think it needs more and
86:35 - perhaps a bit more padding which I try
86:41 - to double it
86:52 - okay not quite as bad
86:58 - are we getting it's a little off I think
87:01 - we it's throwing it off the alignment
87:03 - because this title has its own margin at
87:07 - the top yeah so that's throwing
87:10 - everything off I'm gonna take away the
87:12 - top margin from the title so that it's
87:17 - not throwing because right now it very
87:19 - Clea looks like it's down a bit lower
87:22 - than it should be if we were trying to
87:23 - Center it completely because we have
87:25 - this invisible space up here that's
87:27 - adding height to this element so I'm
87:31 - going to take that out and then we
87:33 - should get a truer vertical line so
87:39 - where's that all our H fours
88:00 - okay there we go so that gives us a
88:04 - better vertical line the only one that
88:08 - looks weird
88:10 - this one looks weird because it doesn't
88:13 - have any border yeah every all the other
88:16 - ones look like they have a top and a
88:17 - bottom border but you know it's really
88:19 - just the bottom border for all of them
88:23 - so I don't know maybe it would look
88:26 - better if there was a border on the top
88:28 - just for the first one
88:56 - oops border tough
89:04 - okay I don't know if it makes it look
89:10 - better but at least they get a better
89:11 - idea of what these this padding looks
89:16 - like
89:28 - I'm gonna go back to the live show just
89:30 - to check in with everyone
89:46 - okay Santa asks would you have text in
89:49 - there on the right and I hadn't thought
89:52 - of that but now that I see it and I see
89:54 - all this space that actually would be
89:56 - well actually I will say like none of
90:01 - the titles are gonna be so let me let's
90:03 - get an idea of what the average title is
90:06 - going to be anyway cuz I would I think
90:08 - most of the titles are pretty long so
90:10 - we're not actually gonna have a lot of
90:12 - space here but let's I'm gonna go to the
90:15 - live site okay so yeah all right some of
90:27 - the titles are kind of short some of
90:29 - them are longer you know this one is
90:31 - definitely definitely a bit longer I
90:42 - don't want to click the link okay so
90:48 - anyway so yeah I mean if we were gonna
90:50 - have everything be this short I think it
90:54 - would be good to put text here I just
90:57 - know that so the people are making this
91:00 - a four seem to really like long titles
91:03 - like really long titles so that's been
91:05 - it's been difficult for me to try to fit
91:09 - in all these titles I have a lot of like
91:11 - wrapping of text going on where it
91:13 - shouldn't be so I'm just trying like
91:17 - thinking it is likely that the titles
91:21 - for these things will end up being huge
91:24 - especially once they see how much more
91:26 - space they have here than they did in
91:28 - the the cards and even this author thing
91:34 - is not necessarily even going to be
91:37 - someone's name it could potentially be
91:41 - like multiple names so if this is a
91:44 - video with more than one person or a
91:47 - book with more than one person I mean
91:49 - this could end up being like four names
91:51 - and if you look some of the names are
91:56 - crazy because it's not just a name
91:58 - to name Plus like all the degrees that
92:01 - they've had after that so I'm thinking
92:05 - that this space is more than likely
92:08 - going to be taken up actually once we
92:14 - pull in the real data it'll be way
92:16 - easier to see that so for now I am gonna
92:21 - leave a space here and then when we pull
92:23 - in the data if we find that we're still
92:25 - having a decent amount of space then
92:27 - maybe we could put a small amount of
92:29 - text there but I definitely want four
92:36 - just so that users don't have to scroll
92:38 - too much
92:39 - I would like these to be shorter rather
92:42 - than taller so it's thing obviously once
92:52 - it gets down you know to where these
92:55 - stack that has to change because there's
93:00 - no way they'll be able to stack properly
93:03 - I don't know hmm I'm actually not
93:09 - entirely sure that they should stack
93:11 - when it gets lower I mean there'd be
93:17 - some crazy text wrapping going on but
93:22 - now let's see what this looks like
93:25 - okay that's more reasonable I think if I
93:28 - Center that image that that actually is
93:30 - more reasonable so maybe they ought to
93:31 - stack I think actually like I looked
93:35 - better here on a smaller more narrow
93:38 - screen than on the large one
93:45 - the title I gave this is just nonsense
93:48 - and ridiculous but in that font it just
93:51 - it looks like impressive doesn't it well
93:54 - you could write anything in this font
93:56 - and it would look impressive all right
94:00 - let's see
94:02 - Oh Roland's going to sleep thanks for
94:07 - thanks for watching and thank you thanks
94:09 - for contributing I appreciate it it's a
94:12 - what is it about two o'clock in the
94:14 - morning where you're at so that's
94:17 - awesome for staying up that late just
94:19 - just for this l Bri so says what about
94:25 - two per row yeah we talked about two per
94:29 - row earlier that's still potentially an
94:32 - option I don't want to make a decision
94:36 - on the two per row until I actually get
94:37 - the real data in here and see how much
94:40 - space is being taken up and then oh I
94:42 - think we'll have a much better feel for
94:46 - just how much you know extra space we
94:50 - have because even with this I mean I
94:53 - could move this over more I suppose but
94:57 - it would still you know this is a really
95:00 - wide screen let me move this screen down
95:03 - into what a more normal screen would be
95:08 - so I guess a more normal desktop screen
95:12 - would end up being like this so so
95:14 - looking at it from this perspective this
95:17 - actually looks a lot nicer and more
95:19 - balanced so I haven't checked the
95:23 - analytics for a while but I don't think
95:28 - we get many users that have really wide
95:31 - screens so even as we go out
95:38 - I mean even getting into this with you
95:42 - know that's that's still reasonable
95:43 - we're getting a bit more white space but
95:46 - it would definitely you know it's
95:48 - reasonable and it would be tough to
95:49 - squeeze it in to too
96:01 - but I definitely want to do something
96:03 - about these images
96:20 - because I really have no idea what
96:22 - dimensions the images are going to be in
96:25 - there could be all different ones so I
96:28 - don't want to make assumptions about
96:30 - what the image is going to be like or
96:32 - design based on a certain image
96:34 - dimension because it could totally
96:37 - change so all we all we want to do with
96:40 - images is just set maximum maximum
96:45 - Heights that they could be I guess
96:50 - that's all we're really worried about so
96:55 - that's what I'm gonna do so I'm gonna
96:57 - look check the height of this image and
97:03 - just get let's get a feel for like what
97:06 - what is the biggest image that would
97:07 - make sense here you know how big do we
97:09 - want this like I'm thinkin I I guess I
97:16 - really don't want it to be wider than
97:18 - this or taller than this I mean that
97:23 - that's honestly even a little bit taller
97:25 - than I think I would 1 so what if the
97:28 - max image height would be like maybe 200
97:42 - is this decent for now I think I'm gonna
97:47 - set it at 200 I'm gonna set it at 200
97:55 - and then let's put in the real data and
97:57 - just see what it looks like and then the
98:00 - streams been going on for what at least
98:03 - two hours now so that's it so well let's
98:08 - put in the data see what it looks like
98:10 - and then kind of wrap things up maybe
98:15 - make a bit some more adjustments but I
98:18 - think we got I mean it's definitely way
98:21 - different than it was from the start so
98:24 - and it's a lot closer to what I had
98:28 - sketched on paper so it definitely needs
98:34 - some work
98:35 - I'm not I'm not happy with it as it is
98:37 - now but it definitely gives me a good
98:41 - idea I like to see that I think it might
98:45 - be good to like sleep on it and come
98:47 - back tomorrow and or what's Friday I'll
98:50 - come back on Monday and hopefully my
98:54 - subconscious will have worked on this
98:56 - over the weekend yeah all right so let's
99:01 - go back I do want to put this Mac site
99:04 - in for the images right now and I'm only
99:10 - gonna put this let's see which one did
99:13 - we want to keep
99:21 - actually I think I want to keep the
99:23 - spacing for this one now that I see it
99:25 - with a longer title so this will be the
99:28 - one that we keep so let's put in max
99:36 - height
99:44 - of 200 pixels it's crazy
99:50 - I keep glancing at the analytics for the
99:52 - video and it's crazy like as the video
99:54 - goes on the viewership just drops off I
99:57 - guess it makes sense you know like
99:59 - everybody gets the notification at first
100:01 - and they check it out so I mean that's
100:03 - the big burst but like we've dropped
100:05 - like half of the amount of years we had
100:08 - you know like in the first half an hour
100:10 - I'm not complaining about it I'm just
100:13 - like observing that it's interesting
100:14 - like you know that we get I'm just
100:17 - always interested in certain times
100:19 - during the video it picks up and it
100:20 - drops off and I just I've no idea why
100:23 - you know there are different patterns I
100:28 - guess and in the people viewing alright
100:32 - so we don't need these anymore so I do
100:49 - want so for now I'm gonna leave this
100:58 - like this but obviously I'm gonna make
101:00 - this its own component you know and it's
101:02 - it's going to be a separate file and a
101:03 - separate component but for now just to
101:06 - test this out we'll just leave it all
101:07 - here what I want to do is I want to give
101:14 - this a class so I can put more easily
101:20 - put the padding top I want to move I
101:23 - want to move a bunch of these styles
101:24 - down not right now but let's give it a
101:27 - class of resource resource row I guess
101:37 - they're all rows now so that kind of
101:38 - makes sense the code a resource row and
101:42 - then down here I'm just going to do one
101:46 - thing
101:55 - research will i always forget what these
101:59 - are what is it first I'll just look it
102:06 - up I think there's like a first of type
102:10 - and a first I guess I guess first of
102:22 - type is what I want right this don't use
102:30 - these often enough to to remember them
102:34 - and now we want to give this the border
102:37 - I'm gonna copy this this is what we want
102:42 - you so much gonna copy this part
102:56 - there we go okay let's make sure I
103:00 - didn't pull out anything really
103:03 - important okay cool so we have the
103:08 - border at the top great
103:10 - all right now let's put this so here's
103:15 - what we want we want to drop down into
103:18 - JavaScript now and we want to get this
103:20 - state data and then we want to map that
103:25 - right and we map that we're going to
103:34 - call it will just call this it's been
103:36 - call each one resource right usually I
103:40 - just call it post let's go I'll just
103:42 - call cocos2d consistent with everything
103:44 - else that I have going on so we can use
103:52 - this arrow function and this will just
103:56 - return all of this
104:06 - so now within post we can get obviously
104:10 - this will eventually be an image URL I
104:14 - kind of want to leave this in for now
104:16 - just so we get an idea of what it looks
104:18 - like with images now you know what I'm
104:19 - going to change it because not
104:23 - everything is gonna have an image so I
104:24 - do want to see what they look like
104:25 - without images and if it looks good
104:28 - interspersed with some that do have
104:30 - images so let me get I have the this is
104:35 - what the the data is gonna look like so
104:38 - we'll have where's our image okay so we
104:44 - need to do a CF URL I'm gonna put this
104:47 - on my other screen so I can see it as
104:49 - where as I'm putting it in so for source
104:52 - it's actually gonna be we're gonna have
104:58 - to do some logic in here so it's gonna
105:00 - say post dot a CF has a zone property I
105:15 - think that's what it's called has been
105:17 - property now you know what it is gonna
105:22 - have URL no matter what let me check
105:23 - this up
105:27 - no I don't want I'm sorry I thought it
105:31 - was gonna be a CF URL it's gonna be
105:33 - better featured image so what I want to
105:38 - say is post better featured image and
105:45 - then I want to make sure that it's not
105:48 - equal to null
105:51 - it's not equal to null then I want to
105:56 - put in I want to use the post
106:01 - better featured image otherwise this is
106:10 - gonna look terrible for now and I need
106:11 - to do it what I need to do is is check
106:14 - this all somewhere else and then just
106:17 - put it in for now unless I can just copy
106:23 - it quickly I might still have it up here
106:25 - then you just copy it to the resource
106:28 - card I don't know what's working how was
106:33 - that
106:39 - I guess I was annoying it like that I
106:41 - was thinking that if I just added a
106:43 - blank source that it would give me that
106:48 - weird little box that says there's no
106:49 - image so we'll just leave it like that
106:52 - for now we'll leave it like this for now
106:56 - and what else do we need we need the
107:01 - title so let's with a curly bracket
107:06 - we're gonna go into JavaScript land here
107:09 - and let's get post ACF and actually it's
107:14 - just title post title rendered so we
107:21 - have that and now for the for the author
107:31 - it's just thing about the author not all
107:33 - of them have an author yet so I am gonna
107:36 - have to check first so what we do want
107:43 - it to say is we wanted to say author :
107:48 - and then a space then we want to check
107:52 - and see post ACF has property
108:04 - and if it says author then we're going
108:12 - to use post otherwise we're not going to
108:22 - do anything
108:32 - and for this we're gonna do post whoops
108:38 - gonna go into JavaScript toast dot ACF
108:44 - dots type and then although we're not
108:54 - using this right now may as well put it
108:57 - in I mean it's all it's hidden for now
109:08 - and for this one since it could
109:13 - potentially have HTML in it I want to do
109:20 - dangerously set inner HTML I can use
109:25 - this and be confident with it because
109:26 - the data I'm being it's being pulled in
109:28 - is from WordPress a wordpress
109:30 - installation I have control of it's not
109:32 - a good idea to pull in data this way
109:34 - from sources that you don't have control
109:37 - of because potentially you know harmful
109:41 - stuff could get pulled in so use with
109:44 - caution obviously because it's just
109:47 - dangerously set it but we're gonna live
109:51 - dangerously today and put in put this in
109:56 - and let me think is it trying to
110:01 - remember how this is yeah I think that's
110:06 - what it how you do it
110:16 - oops I just I just noticed the typo
110:19 - sorry title there we go post AC is a VCF
110:25 - yeah description okay and that's what we
110:36 - need for now
110:39 - oops I'm sorry I forgot one very
110:43 - important thing we need the URL and
110:50 - that's gonna be post dot a CF dot URL
110:57 - and then let's go ahead and put in a
111:00 - title tag we'll just do post a CF our
111:09 - post title rendered there we go now I'll
111:17 - save it and let's see what happens
111:25 - getting a long refresh here let me
111:29 - restart my dev server cuz it seems like
111:32 - I messed it up luckily this only takes
111:39 - about three seconds
111:45 - all right so we did have a problem and
111:47 - this was where I went to set dangerously
111:49 - set innerhtml
111:51 - so let's see I know that I've
111:56 - dangerously said it somewhere else so
111:57 - I'm just gonna look at where I did it
111:59 - elsewhere and copy that there we go oh
112:09 - okay
112:10 - I forgot another set of brackets I was
112:18 - kind of thinking I needed another set of
112:20 - Arrakis
112:38 - I think I don't know if you can hear
112:39 - that on here but I just heard thunder
112:41 - outside and I didn't bring my umbrella
112:45 - today so I was gonna bring my umbrella
112:47 - and then one of my daughter's said I
112:49 - want to use the umbrella so I let her
112:52 - have the umbrella so now I'm I'm
112:55 - umbrella this for today
113:06 - okay so I'll shoot I need to dangerously
113:12 - set innerhtml in these titles so that
113:14 - these characters look right but other
113:17 - than that shoot I forgot to since I'm on
113:23 - localhost I can't pull in images from
113:25 - WordPress either so that won't let me so
113:29 - maybe it actually it doesn't look
113:33 - terrible
113:35 - it looks a little weird for the for ones
113:39 - without images here's an idea suit you
113:44 - think what if the image was on this side
113:48 - then the text would be over here so if
113:51 - there wasn't an image which is likely
113:53 - for some of them that they're not going
113:54 - to be an image it wouldn't it wouldn't
113:58 - look offset so like if there was an
114:00 - image here then this one would what do
114:03 - you think what do you think about that
114:04 - I'm gonna check the live chat since I
114:06 - haven't checked in well anyway but I
114:07 - would like to know if we moved it so
114:10 - that images appear too over here with
114:12 - that would that be okay now what I think
114:16 - about it I think it might
114:36 - okay bill says maybe add some styling to
114:40 - an HR tag to have it fade on the left
114:43 - and right side that's a great idea I
114:44 - hadn't I can't believe I didn't even
114:46 - think of an HR tag instead of a border
114:50 - that that's a really good idea thanks
114:52 - for that bill
115:08 - sebastien acts where the text will go
115:11 - when you click read more this will just
115:14 - get bigger and there'll be text here and
115:17 - then there'll be an option to to
115:21 - minimize it again
115:26 - Zanna says give them say like 10 10 vh
115:31 - for the for the image height okay yeah I
115:34 - do I like going with using VH if you're
115:42 - not familiar the VH is its viewport
115:46 - height so if I said 10 viewport height
115:48 - as the image height then it would take
115:51 - up like 10 percent of the current the
115:54 - height of the viewport in the same way
115:59 - with VW you port with and it works the
116:02 - same way
116:08 - Philip s can you render server-side with
116:12 - react if you are you if you're using go
116:14 - I don't know I've never used it with go
116:17 - I they're not not read anything about
116:19 - that so I'm sorry but I can't I can't
116:23 - really give you an accurate answer for
116:25 - that
116:30 - Nathan caught the title spelled wrong
116:33 - before I did so sorry I didn't I didn't
116:35 - look over at the live chat but thanks
116:37 - for pointing that out Athan bill says if
116:42 - there's no author will it say author no
116:45 - actually long as I was typing that out I
116:48 - thought it probably shouldn't say
116:49 - authors should just be nothing I can
116:52 - make it so that author is a required
116:55 - field if I want to but I don't think I
116:57 - really want to because you know maybe
116:59 - they don't I mean I think everything
117:02 - would have to have somebody that made it
117:03 - but just in case I should make it so
117:06 - that nothing would show up instead of
117:11 - author
117:20 - okay Andrew says image on the right
117:23 - would be better okay bill says that he
117:32 - has the an allow control origin star
117:36 - which is like all chrome plug-in to let
117:40 - me get around the localhost course
117:43 - issues but it says we're to word to the
117:46 - wise disable that when done or you will
117:48 - have headaches okay that's actually that
117:51 - might be useful for this project Andrew
117:57 - asks what the client is going to input
117:59 - data with in WordPress so the client
118:03 - will be the content management system
118:06 - for all this is WordPress and then it
118:09 - gets pulled in here okay so I think I'm
118:19 - gonna wrap things up now cuz it's been a
118:21 - pretty long stream we're at two and a
118:23 - half out oh I forgot I started this
118:25 - dream late so we're not into an effort
118:27 - we're actually only about two hours I
118:29 - started a half hour later than normal
118:31 - but it's still a really long stream at
118:33 - two hours so I think I think I'm going
118:38 - to wrap it up here I'm gonna go back
118:41 - through the live chat and make sure I
118:43 - didn't miss anything right now and miss
118:46 - any questions if if you don't want to
118:48 - stick around for the question
118:49 - question-and-answer session that we're
118:51 - about to have then thanks for watching
118:56 - and I'll see you next week thanks thanks
119:00 - for being involved in the live chat
119:04 - otherwise if you're gonna stick around
119:05 - you have any questions put them in the
119:07 - live chat or you can put them in the
119:09 - comments to this video or if you're shy
119:12 - you can direct message me on on Twitter
119:17 - my the link to my Twitter profile is in
119:20 - the description below and I'm definitely
119:24 - gonna take into account all everything
119:26 - that you all said whenever
119:28 - I work on this and decide and then once
119:32 - I get this down then I'll show it to
119:33 - everyone else involved in this project
119:35 - and they'll there may be some some other
119:38 - things because that need to change based
119:41 - on that but a decent work I'm I'm
119:48 - satisfied that you know with with the
119:51 - basics that we got here today this is
119:55 - looking a lot closer to what it will end
119:58 - up being okay so I'm gonna go back
120:12 - through the live chat quickly if and it
120:15 - looks like I've kept up with the live
120:16 - chat pretty well so I don't think
120:20 - there's a lot that I need to catch up on
120:22 - so it won't take me too long so if you
120:26 - have any questions put them up there
120:27 - quickly
121:07 - okay I saw weight really early on like
121:11 - right at the beginning we were talking
121:13 - about the 100 days of code challenge and
121:16 - I had I had said I thought you can just
121:20 - start whenever you want but I wasn't
121:21 - sure and I didn't notice before but
121:23 - Zanna says yeah you can just start
121:25 - coding whenever and just keep it going
121:27 - for a hundred days so thanks for that
121:29 - answer sorry I didn't see it earlier
121:32 - but and I'm not I'm not sure if the
121:35 - person that asked about it is even in
121:38 - here anymore
121:40 - Navin or Naveen I'm not sure how to
121:42 - pronounce your first name so sorry if
121:44 - I'm mispronouncing it but that's who
121:47 - asked the question initially but the
121:49 - hundred days of code is a really cool
121:51 - concept I actually haven't done it yet I
121:54 - should do it because I I i usually code
122:01 - usually I try not to I usually take
122:04 - Sundays off and if I do any code it's
122:07 - like fun stuff like I'm working on a
122:09 - game with my oldest son so I'll code
122:12 - that but other than that I code pretty
122:16 - consistently Monday through Saturday so
122:18 - I should just do it
122:41 - okay still going through nothing new in
122:43 - the live chat so I think I covered most
122:47 - of it okay there was still I think I
122:56 - mentioned before there was some
122:57 - discussion about code editors and I kind
123:00 - of skipped over it at the time but it
123:03 - seems like some people are saying the
123:08 - consensus always seems to be that Adam
123:11 - is slow at least slower than all the
123:14 - other editors that everyone uses so the
123:16 - alternatives that were mentioned were
123:18 - Visual Studio code brackets and sublime
124:03 - okay here's a question so Thomas asked
124:06 - in terms of workflow what would you
124:09 - suggest to beginners in react as on how
124:12 - to start their site creation should
124:16 - think of the different components based
124:18 - on wire framing or use a specific
124:19 - approach yeah I mean I suppose it
124:27 - depends on what would you already are
124:29 - used to in which you like but if you're
124:31 - starting like from a wireframe then yeah
124:34 - you could you could actually just take
124:41 - you know either within whatever program
124:44 - you're using or even if you print it out
124:45 - and are just a sketch you can just draw
124:48 - a boxes around everything and each each
124:51 - thing that you could draw a box around
124:53 - could be its own separate component
124:55 - usually it's a good idea to try to make
124:58 - the components so that they only do one
125:00 - thing so the smaller you can break down
125:04 - components
125:05 - it's normally better so as far as
125:10 - specific approach I I don't know of any
125:16 - approaches maybe there are but I mean I
125:18 - don't know like if there's any official
125:22 - approaches to to starting a project like
125:25 - that
125:42 - okay as Anna said she found a really
125:45 - nice tutorial for react and it was
125:49 - called react Jas tutorial number one -
125:52 - react.js JavaScript introduction and
125:55 - workspace setup on youtube so if you
126:00 - search for that on YouTube I haven't
126:02 - seen it yet so it's not really an
126:04 - official endorsement but XANA seems to
126:08 - be pretty knowledgeable from what from
126:10 - all the contributions to the live chat
126:12 - so it's probably a pretty legit video
126:20 - under the watcher asks are you saving
126:22 - the stream yeah the stream will be
126:24 - available just a few minutes after it
126:26 - ends it's available to watch the
126:29 - recording so if you can't if you didn't
126:32 - catch the entire stream or if you can't
126:34 - stick around for the whole stream or
126:37 - especially there there are people that
126:40 - just this time of day because the time
126:43 - zones it's just it doesn't work for them
126:45 - to watch it or because of even if the
126:48 - time zone thing is not a big deal
126:50 - they're working or something at this
126:52 - time so there's a lot of people that do
126:54 - watch the recording well I appreciate
127:00 - when when you make the effort to be in
127:04 - the live chat if you can so it's really
127:05 - nice to have everybody's contributions
127:13 - Rogerio asks I don't think he's in here
127:17 - anymore but maybe he'll watch the
127:19 - recording are you developing on top of
127:20 - WordPress I think I mentioned this at
127:23 - some point
127:24 - but yeah the content management system
127:26 - is WordPress but what I'm working with
127:30 - right now is is react so it's two
127:34 - separate servers that are actually
127:37 - running these sites and I just use
127:41 - WordPress for the content management and
127:43 - I pull the data with the WordPress API
127:45 - into react so all the display stuff the
127:49 - UI
127:50 - everything that he user sees is is react
128:04 - okay side Siberian well there's more to
128:12 - the name I'm just gonna say Siberian for
128:14 - short says off-topic question bootstrap
128:16 - versus foundation I know I don't really
128:26 - use bootstrap or foundation often
128:28 - actually I just help someone out with
128:31 - one of their projects last night someone
128:34 - had watched the livestream
128:36 - yeah I've chat yesterday and I had
128:38 - mentioned that they could direct message
128:41 - me to help out so they did and gave me a
128:43 - link to the project and it was using
128:44 - foundation and I haven't worked with
128:46 - foundation for a really long time so
128:48 - that was kind of cool and interesting
128:49 - too I just read through the docs a
128:51 - little bit and I think ended up fixing
128:54 - the problem I haven't heard back from
128:57 - them though so hopefully I fix the
129:00 - problem so that's like the most
129:04 - experience I've had with foundation a
129:06 - long time in with bootstrap the last
129:09 - time I used bootstrap was probably when
129:11 - I went through like the very first part
129:13 - of the free code campaign sorry let me
129:20 - take this call really quick it's just
129:22 - gonna be a few seconds hello
129:27 - yes I'm still here are you are you
129:32 - leaving now okay yeah if you could that
129:37 - would be awesome
129:38 - sorry I didn't come over yeah I'll be
129:42 - I'll hope you hear Thanks all right
129:47 - right
129:50 - sorry about that but here's the the time
129:55 - where I give the usual speech here this
129:57 - shows about me doing my normal work
130:00 - every day so interruptions like phone
130:02 - calls happen and that's okay because I
130:04 - want people to see what my life as a
130:07 - front-end developer is so so
130:13 - interruptions are welcome so anyway
130:21 - there's a lot of talk in the live chat
130:23 - about foundation versus bootstrap so I'm
130:29 - gonna skip over since I am not familiar
130:32 - that much with either one of them
130:34 - especially with any like new
130:36 - developments with them I'm not really
130:39 - gonna weigh in
130:43 - Rogerio asks so I need a framework like
130:47 - that to use react with WordPress er is
130:50 - it optional so he's talking about do I
130:52 - need a framework like next j/s which I'm
130:55 - assuming a framework like next yes
130:58 - and no you don't really I've used you
131:10 - could you could use just plain react set
131:13 - up yourself or any type of scaffolding
131:15 - that like create react app or you know
131:18 - anything there's a ton of different
131:19 - scaffolding options for react so no you
131:23 - don't really need to next yes just makes
131:25 - it really easy to pull in data and
131:27 - render it server-side but it's not
131:30 - impossible certainly to do it without
131:33 - next
131:42 - okay so we did have a couple other like
131:46 - CSS frameworks mentioned so I'll just
131:48 - mention them as well XANA mentions
131:51 - skeleton it's a really light framework
131:53 - so I haven't checked out skeleton for a
131:56 - long time but I remember being impressed
131:58 - with how lightweight it was I'm when I
132:02 - made it was probably a few years ago
132:03 - last time I checked it out also I think
132:08 - there's one other one I saw mentioned Oh
132:12 - many dot CSS I have I haven't checked so
132:16 - bill bill says many dot CSS I have no
132:19 - experience with that but I guess it's a
132:22 - really bill so it's really lightweight
132:47 - I just saw that comment that Jack made
132:50 - earlier about me sounding like Evan
132:52 - Peters and I still don't know who Evan
132:53 - Peters is so if anybody knows telling me
132:56 - please
132:58 - I'm not really that worried about it but
133:00 - it would be cool if if I actually do
133:02 - sound like that person it would be fun
133:05 - to to listen and compare
133:25 - I kept looking through again and it
133:27 - looks like I miss actually two people
133:31 - said that they think two per row would
133:33 - make sense for our resources so I am
133:37 - gonna keep that in mind if you missed I
133:39 - explained a little more towards the
133:40 - beginning of the video why I might do
133:43 - two per row but some reasons why I might
133:46 - not and it's gonna end up being one of
133:49 - those things that may happen if I have
133:51 - time but the way things are going I
133:53 - don't think I'm gonna have time to do
133:55 - anything extra to this right now there's
133:57 - just a lot that needs done before I need
134:01 - to be done with this project Oh Samson
134:06 - said I'm late again so I didn't notice
134:09 - that at first I don't think but what's
134:11 - alright Samson better late than never
134:13 - right you can always catch up on the
134:15 - recording and thanks for joining even if
134:19 - you know even if it was late that's fine
134:22 - with me
134:28 - a los Anna says 11 p.m. it's in if you
134:34 - don't mind me asking what country are
134:37 - you in I just like to get a feel for
134:39 - like timezone so it was about 4 o'clock
134:42 - here and about 11 p.m. where you were I
134:49 - said I haven't done this for a long time
134:51 - but earlier on when I first started
134:54 - doing the videos I always had everyone
134:56 - shout out where they were from at the
134:58 - beginning and it was always cool to see
135:01 - where everyone was from around the world
135:02 - so we we definitely have I mean we
135:05 - started out with like a hundred years
135:06 - and now we're down to 34 so won't have
135:10 - quite as many but if you're still
135:11 - listening and able to it would be cool
135:13 - to say where you're from and I could
135:15 - just read out really quickly where
135:17 - everyone's from I'll have to remember to
135:18 - say that at the beginning when we have a
135:21 - lot of viewers for the next one
135:23 - because that was always really fun and
135:27 - sometimes people who are maybe too
135:30 - nervous to ask a question or give a
135:32 - comment about code are cool with
135:36 - shouting out where they live because you
135:39 - know it's a much much less pressure on
135:42 - them so it's kind of cool because you
135:44 - know more people join in the chat right
135:46 - away
136:07 - vipul said hi hey thanks for joining on
136:17 - vipul also says what is react and what
136:21 - is the difference between react and are
136:23 - so reactive javascript framework and i
136:28 - actually L reto there's some good
136:29 - answers in live chat so l BRE so says
136:32 - it's like react versus angular verse
136:34 - with you so like there's a distinction
136:37 - between what react does and what angular
136:39 - does but like for the most part people
136:41 - do compare them so reacts if you know
136:46 - about angular or about view you can
136:49 - pretty much think of react in a similar
136:51 - way I know people say that like angular
136:54 - handles the entire like MVC if you're
136:57 - doing an MVC like style project and
137:00 - angular is just the V in MVC or MV star
137:05 - is what people say sometimes but aside
137:10 - from that usually people do use one or
137:16 - the other
137:17 - angular will react
137:25 - XANA says tried to learn angular in 2016
137:29 - but I didn't have solid no js' knowledge
137:31 - at the time and didn't understand much
137:32 - but now I can say it's something I could
137:35 - grasp quite easily but I'm sure react is
137:37 - better actually
137:38 - that's like the same experience that I
137:40 - had so I think it was I think it was
137:46 - maybe for me like 2015 yeah I mean it
137:51 - was like 20 2015 possibly early 2016
137:55 - when I tried to do something with
137:56 - angular but I had the same problem I
137:58 - just wasn't good enough with JavaScript
138:00 - and I just couldn't get anything to work
138:05 - in angular so but now I'm sure it would
138:11 - be different and I've heard angular has
138:12 - changed quite a lot since when I worked
138:15 - with it it was angular 1 now I think
138:17 - they're up to 4 and I'm not even sure
138:19 - but yeah so I don't know enough about
138:24 - angular now especially the new versions
138:26 - to really say much about it but I've
138:29 - seen a lot of cool things built with it
138:30 - and I know people that have built that
138:33 - that develop an angular and they're
138:35 - really good good developers way better
138:38 - than me
138:46 - now Bree so says I just learned about
138:49 - Beaumont CSS I've never heard of that
138:52 - is it good as anybody used to okay jack
138:57 - says Evan Peters was on American Horror
139:00 - Story and he was Quicksilver in the Fox
139:03 - x-men movie no way maybe the second
139:08 - first-class movie oh cool I really like
139:12 - that character I'm gonna have to listen
139:15 - to him now
139:16 - I mean like whenever you hear your own
139:19 - voice like when you're talking it sounds
139:22 - way different than it really sounds to
139:24 - everyone else so I'll have to listen to
139:26 - a recording of my voice and then listen
139:28 - to that guy too but that's cool I'm
139:31 - definitely fine with sounding like him
139:32 - his character and the movie was probably
139:36 - one of my favorite characters so so I
139:39 - think that as a compliment
139:41 - thanks jack alright so you did some
139:44 - people shouting out where they're from
139:46 - bill saying I'm not gonna shout out
139:50 - everybody's names in case you don't want
139:52 - people to know where you're from I'll
139:53 - just say where it is so we have Michigan
139:56 - Texas Chicago London New York another
140:00 - Chicago Serbia Ontario and Delaware and
140:06 - says Delaware don't ask cool so we have
140:12 - definitely like all over the United
140:14 - States and then some foreign countries
140:18 - as well
140:21 - Ireland - awesome actually uh we have in
140:27 - my department our head videographer
140:32 - director of videography is is from
140:36 - Canada so I can't remember if he was I'm
140:40 - pretty sure he was from around Ontario
140:41 - as well his family actually still lives
140:44 - up there so he's trying to like work and
140:46 - get money to be able to move him down
140:47 - here so but really good guy very
140:52 - talented with the video work he does Oh
140:55 - Romania okay cool
140:59 - I I just love that there are so many
141:02 - people from all over all over the world
141:06 - always my um the people that are like
141:10 - the head of my department are really in
141:13 - pretty much everybody that's higher up
141:17 - here at the University of our work is
141:18 - pretty much really against remote work
141:21 - because they say like all you need to
141:23 - come in so we can collaborate and I
141:25 - always think it's funny and I usually
141:28 - make comments like I pretty much stay in
141:31 - my office and when I need to talk to my
141:33 - co-workers that you slack and and then I
141:38 - come on here with you all and we
141:40 - basically build websites together I mean
141:43 - so much of the decisions that I make are
141:45 - based on your input and then at times
141:47 - you all even write code and submit pull
141:50 - requests so we work on these sites
141:52 - together and I feel like I collaborate
141:54 - with you all even though you're spread
141:55 - throughout the world then I do with I
141:57 - would say 99% of the people that
141:59 - actually work here on campus so so it's
142:03 - always crazy to me the idea that somehow
142:06 - I have to be physically present on
142:08 - campus to be able to collaborate and
142:10 - that's that's just insane in fact I had
142:11 - I had two meetings today I will actually
142:15 - I had three phone meetings today
142:17 - two of them were phone interviews with
142:19 - people and I didn't even go in they had
142:22 - a conference room set up with a
142:23 - speakerphone and I didn't go in there
142:26 - because for me that would have been
142:29 - harder it would been harder for me to
142:31 - hear I would have had to shout for ever
142:33 - someone to hear me on the speakerphone
142:34 - instead I sit at my computer i dial in
142:36 - through I'm a Google Phi customer so I
142:40 - just dial in through Gmail it's the same
142:43 - headphones I have one now I'm using the
142:44 - same mic that I used to livestream I
142:46 - have my my setup here with my computer's
142:48 - so when I'm talking to a candidate I
142:50 - have their websites up and their resume
142:53 - and I can check out everything it's so
142:56 - much easier for me to interact with
142:58 - people from right here in my office and
143:01 - then the third meeting that I had I was
143:03 - actually driving to go get some food
143:05 - really quickly I decided to go get food
143:09 - 25 minutes for
143:10 - I've stream started so I went to the
143:12 - store this I didn't speed but I like
143:15 - went to the store grab something really
143:16 - fast bought it and came back and I made
143:18 - it back with five minutes to spare I was
143:20 - excited about that but I had a phone
143:25 - call meeting on the way there
143:28 - which was fine which I was totally able
143:31 - to contribute to this meeting while I
143:33 - was walking around in a store so it's
143:35 - just I'm a really big advocate of remote
143:38 - work in case you couldn't tell I think
143:40 - there are definite advantages to it
143:42 - there are advantages to being able to
143:44 - meet face-to-face
143:45 - - but anymore when you have video chat
143:50 - and I mean soon virtual reality is going
143:52 - to be like high enough quality that it's
143:56 - gonna really mimic you know being next
143:59 - to a person so at that point the
144:01 - advantages of being face-to-face are
144:03 - gonna keep going down and down and I
144:05 - guess you're just better off meeting
144:08 - online and not sharing germs at that
144:11 - point anyway sorry for the long the long
144:19 - speech occasionally I go into long talks
144:23 - about my opinion but I actually gain
144:25 - viewers during that old thing so maybe
144:27 - it was good so let me I had a couple
144:33 - more questions while I was talking so
144:34 - I'm going to go through that and then if
144:36 - I don't get any other questions that'll
144:38 - be all for today so Sam says for someone
144:44 - who has primitive knowledge in HTML CSS
144:47 - how long does it take an average person
144:49 - to get to the point where you can apply
144:51 - for jobs I would say apply for jobs at
144:59 - any point first of all so that's not
145:01 - exactly an answer to the question but
145:04 - people need like a varying skill levels
145:07 - so like potentially there are a lot of
145:11 - businesses that think they need a
145:14 - developer but in reality they have like
145:16 - a wordpress site that needs just really
145:20 - basic stuff done they need somebody to
145:22 - like upload blog
145:23 - the wordpress and change images and
145:25 - stuff in that case like you can
145:28 - definitely get that job you can get
145:31 - freelance work with just basic knowledge
145:33 - of HTML and CSS that's how I started out
145:35 - was just getting freelance and
145:37 - subcontracting work and then I just I
145:40 - really worked on my CSS and HTML skills
145:43 - and once I got more comfortable with
145:46 - that I I turned to improving my
145:48 - JavaScript and I started trying to only
145:51 - take jobs where I would learn what I
145:53 - wanted to learn if I could sometimes I
145:55 - just take jobs just for money because I
145:56 - had to pay the bills but you know all my
146:00 - side projects and things would be based
146:02 - around what I wanted to learn the more
146:04 - you know the more jobs you'd be
146:06 - qualified for but I would say like at
146:08 - any point if you find a job that you
146:10 - really want to do apply you know you
146:13 - know be honest about what your skills
146:15 - are but you know you never know and so
146:20 - much of this is just learning what you
146:22 - need to learn to get the job done that I
146:25 - would say there's not really like a
146:29 - standard time period of how long it
146:32 - would take it's just entirely dependent
146:34 - on how much time you have like every day
146:36 - to put into it what the resources that
146:40 - you use how quick of a learner you are
146:42 - there's just too many factors to say for
146:45 - sure but my only advice is just don't
146:47 - feel like you're not good enough to
146:49 - apply for things you know if you if you
146:52 - meet even some of the requirements for a
146:54 - job it's worth it to apply unless the
146:57 - application process is just way too
146:59 - difficult then then forget it
147:02 - but if it's an easy process to apply you
147:05 - may as well do it I mean the worst that
147:07 - could happen is they say no and you just
147:09 - move on
147:11 - I once applied for a job where the
147:14 - minimum requirements were a master's
147:16 - degree and they prefer to doctorate and
147:19 - they wanted like seven years experience
147:21 - doing a job that I never did and hold on
147:25 - one second I I gotta get this
147:39 - okay someone was at my door
147:41 - but anyway so I applied for this job and
147:44 - obviously I didn't get it but I did
147:47 - actually get to like sit face to face
147:49 - with a person that was interviewing with
147:51 - the job
147:52 - it wasn't like really an interview but
147:54 - it was just the person actually gave me
147:56 - a bunch of advice on what I would need
147:59 - to do to get myself ready for a for this
148:01 - job in the future if it ever came open
148:03 - again so it was definitely worth the
148:05 - experience was good and you know it
148:10 - ended up being worth it for me you know
148:12 - I was totally not qualified for it but I
148:14 - got some really good advice from you
148:18 - know from the person that was hiring for
148:19 - the job so you never know
148:27 - dana says do you also review websites
148:29 - and give tips on improvement I mean like
148:32 - not officially but I've had a lot of
148:35 - people since I started live-streaming
148:37 - just send me messages on Twitter and
148:39 - with links to their stuff and yeah I've
148:43 - looked looked at it I've given tips
148:46 - sometimes like people get err errors
148:48 - with things and they don't know what's
148:51 - going on and so I'll actually try to
148:53 - help them with that you know it just
148:57 - depends on how busy I am at the time
148:59 - like if I can get to it it may take me a
149:01 - little while to get to it but like last
149:04 - night I was able to figure out something
149:06 - for someone that watches the stream and
149:09 - it didn't it didn't take me very long I
149:11 - was looking at their code on my phone
149:13 - just like right before I went to bed and
149:16 - I kind of figure it out so I just opened
149:19 - my laptop real quick tested it it worked
149:22 - and just sent a message back and so you
149:24 - know occasionally I'll just get a few
149:27 - minutes here and there and I might be
149:28 - able to help you out so yeah so feel
149:31 - free I mean if I ever get to the point
149:33 - where I'm getting like hundreds of
149:34 - people asking then maybe I'll have to
149:36 - stop but right now like I'm not really a
149:40 - big deal right now I only have like 40
149:42 - people viewing the stream at this point
149:44 - - I'm definitely open to you know
149:48 - helping you individually if you want me
149:50 - to Ken's Ken says me to remote is great
149:56 - today in in office two days in offices
150:00 - enough so when we were talking about
150:02 - remote work yeah I agree I I honestly
150:05 - think like from my job in particular I
150:08 - could definitely do most of my job from
150:11 - home and I could probably be more
150:13 - productive from home there'd be less
150:15 - like interruptions I could see like if
150:19 - they really want me to come in for a
150:21 - meeting or something then I would come
150:23 - in for that but otherwise yeah I think
150:28 - working from home is is great and then
150:30 - from the perspective of the company like
150:31 - if an employee works from home they
150:34 - don't really need an office they maybe
150:36 - just need somewhere to hang out at when
150:39 - they have to come in so you save space
150:42 - or not providing an office then you
150:45 - don't have to worry about providing the
150:48 - air conditioning and the electricity for
150:50 - that office right so you know you can
150:53 - end up saving a lot of money you know
150:57 - for the long term by having most of your
150:59 - workers be remote or at least those who
151:01 - could be remotely remote so um
151:06 - definitely it's a good idea Gina asks
151:10 - what are you using for back-end so this
151:14 - the the backend for the site well I
151:17 - guess node it's running on node and then
151:22 - the content management system is
151:24 - WordPress and that's running on that
151:28 - uses PHP and then I mean just to kind of
151:33 - say the entire stack is the site's
151:39 - the WordPress site is PHP and it's
151:42 - running on a with Apache and I believe
151:46 - it's using nginx as a reverse proxy the
151:50 - node installations are
151:53 - I actually have I'm using load balancing
151:57 - between two digitalocean droplets that
151:59 - are both running Express which is with
152:02 - node and they're running react then they
152:08 - are running behind nginx being used as a
152:10 - reverse proxy and then in front of all
152:12 - of that is a digitalocean load balancer
152:15 - so that there's really like never any
152:18 - downtime for the site so that might have
152:23 - been more information than you were
152:24 - looking for but hopefully it answered
152:26 - the the question
152:28 - Umberto's said I'm definitely an
152:31 - advocate of remote work as well I'm the
152:34 - telework coordinator at my workplace but
152:36 - my boss doesn't allow us to telework so
152:38 - frustrating oh wow yeah that's that's
152:42 - Thanks yeah you would think you'd be
152:46 - able to do that from oh well maybe maybe
152:50 - someday and he gets into it Archer
152:57 - Archibald says okay in response to so
153:03 - the question from Sam was about how long
153:06 - does it take an average person to get to
153:07 - the point where you can easily apply for
153:09 - jobs or where you can't apply for jobs
153:11 - and then Archibald says in reply when
153:15 - you can comfortably build something that
153:16 - uses auth user roles databases then I'd
153:19 - say you've got the skills yeah I mean if
153:22 - you get to that point you for sure have
153:24 - the skills I would say you don't even
153:25 - have to get to that point simply because
153:28 - I got a full time job doing web
153:32 - development without even ever doing any
153:37 - of that stuff so it does depend on what
153:39 - you're doing like I mean if you're gonna
153:41 - be a front-end developer you don't even
153:44 - necessarily have to know that much about
153:46 - the other stuff especially if you're
153:49 - gonna get a job at a company where there
153:50 - are other people handling that kind of
153:52 - thing like the databases and things you
153:54 - just have to know how to talk to the
153:56 - databases you know through api's and
153:58 - things but but yeah I mean your goal
154:03 - should be to know how to do that you
154:05 - know off the user role stated
154:07 - if you have all that you'll be people
154:10 - will want you right yeah they'll want
154:11 - you to work for them if you have all
154:13 - those skills bill says even if you get
154:16 - turned down at least you gain some
154:18 - interview experience yeah exactly
154:21 - exactly just the experience of it is
154:24 - it's really important it is it is
154:27 - important having confidence when you
154:30 - interview is a really big deal
154:33 - when I interview somebody and they don't
154:36 - seem really confident it's just like
154:39 - even if I can see their code and see
154:42 - that they can do the job it just really
154:46 - makes me doubtful if they're not
154:49 - confident in their interview and you
154:52 - know there might not be the best judge
154:53 - of things but you know I don't want
154:56 - people to be like overconfident but it's
154:59 - nice you know if you ask someone a
155:01 - question an interview if they can say
155:03 - yeah for sure I can do that or I can
155:05 - learn that you know that's that's
155:09 - important and I think to get to that
155:11 - level of confidence in interviewing it
155:14 - helps that practice
155:22 - Dana says I'm actually looking to hire
155:24 - people skilled in react post post I'm
155:29 - not pissed Postgres QL I never know how
155:34 - to say that but etc where would I go to
155:39 - find qualified independent coders I
155:41 - would like some way to verify their
155:43 - skills before hiring I guess to defend
155:50 - like if you want to employ them directly
155:53 - I'm not exactly sure there there are
155:57 - some places where that will help you
155:59 - find candidates trying to think I just
156:03 - saw a place like that recently where
156:06 - they handle the testing them like doing
156:10 - coding tests but I can't remember what
156:11 - it is I'm sorry if I remember at all
156:13 - I'll try to let you know but I don't
156:20 - remember it but then also like if you
156:22 - wanted to hire developers through like a
156:24 - middleman company their companies like
156:27 - top Tao
156:28 - it's t.o.p tal where you can hire a
156:32 - developer but you know tops how it
156:35 - handles all the contract stuff and
156:37 - payments so it's just I guess it depends
156:41 - on what you would you need
156:52 - okay actually well this is really cool
156:55 - so there are a few people in the live
156:56 - chat that are responding to danishes
156:59 - question about being able to hire people
157:01 - so so that's cool
157:05 - I don't know yeah Danish if you uh if
157:12 - you're on Twitter and you want to tweet
157:17 - you can like mention me and a tweet
157:20 - about wanting to hire people and I'll
157:23 - retweet it for you that might help I
157:26 - mean I have I think I only have like 250
157:30 - followers or so so it's not like I have
157:31 - a lot but if like I could potentially
157:34 - get retweeted some of the people that
157:36 - follow me have a lot of followers so if
157:38 - I get retweeted it could get out to a
157:40 - lot of people so so I guess let let me
157:44 - know you know send me a tweet if you
157:46 - want me to do that it's it's worth a
157:47 - shot
157:53 - ok bill says that he's seen people use
157:58 - hacker rank as an initial interview
158:00 - process actually that's cool I never
158:02 - thought of using hacker rank that's a
158:04 - good idea
158:04 - Oh Sam asks how does WordPress CMS
158:12 - played with nodejs isn't it a different
158:14 - stack all together as in a lamp stack
158:18 - this is the first time I was watching
158:20 - your livestream I am yet to browse their
158:23 - previous upto uploads yeah that's cool
158:25 - lot I mean honestly it would be a really
158:27 - daunting task for someone to get through
158:29 - all the live streams at this point
158:31 - because they end up there's a lot of
158:33 - them and they're really long so yeah I
158:35 - don't I don't mind I did explain a lot
158:37 - of it before but I don't mind at all
158:39 - giving a little explanation basically
158:43 - the WordPress installation runs on a
158:46 - totally different server so it can have
158:49 - its own stack and then node has its own
158:51 - stack and they don't you know mess with
158:54 - each other I have heard of people I've
158:57 - had people message me on Twitter and
158:59 - telling me that they've gotten it to run
159:01 - on one server together so I'm not
159:04 - exactly sure how to do
159:06 - but it's possible
159:09 - I always just run them on different
159:10 - servers and then it ends up I mean
159:14 - obviously it just works and then you
159:15 - just share data from through the
159:17 - WordPress API is just a REST API so you
159:20 - just make normal API calls from node to
159:23 - WordPress no unbuilt bill basically just
159:30 - said the same thing about the API so
159:31 - thanks Bill
159:36 - okay and Berta said dice comm so that's
159:39 - also another place to find coders so
159:45 - awesome so I've gotten to the end of the
159:47 - live chat and well I just looked at the
159:52 - time it's a long chat all right so
159:54 - probably won't be doing too much on this
159:56 - site before the next for the next show
160:00 - so you won't miss too much we'll
160:03 - probably be right back where we started
160:06 - so anyway have a great weekend and thank
160:11 - you so much for watching and I'll be
160:14 - back I'll be back Monday I should
160:18 - probably check my calendar really
160:19 - quickly just to make sure I will be back
160:21 - Monday it's possible that I might have a
160:25 - meeting or something so I have my
160:28 - calendar up here on another screen so
160:30 - just take me a second okay yeah I'll be
160:36 - back Monday it looks like I have a
160:37 - meeting at 3:00 p.m. on Monday so it
160:39 - might be a little bit shorter than
160:41 - normal but I should be back at 2:00 p.m.
160:42 - Eastern Time on Monday so anyway again
160:46 - have a great weekend thank you so much
160:48 - for watching and contributing in the
160:50 - live chat if you're watching this later
160:53 - on and you have questions or anything
160:55 - like don't hesitate ask me on Twitter
160:58 - ask me in the comments I'll try to get
160:59 - back to you as soon as I can
161:01 - and I really appreciate everyone's
161:03 - contributions today you all are really
161:07 - awesome so I'll see you see you next
161:11 - week

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody's Jessie and I'm gonna switch things up a little bit from what we've been doing the last two episodes all right so I want to work on some UI stuff so specifically when the let me bring it over what I've done so far just to give you just to get you caught up a little bit actually had I didn't have a ton of time to do work today because I had two phone interviews with candidates for a web developer job and actually went well so I'm happy about that but it did leave me with not a lot of time for this so what I've done since the last four since yesterday is I Trent change these into checkboxes and I made it to that they they work if you check them both you can see all both free and paid obviously or if you uncheck them both you can still see free and paid so it's the sorting works I'm sorry the filtering works this kind of works right now this is the materialized dropdown or select input to use this some JavaScript it needs to be initialized and right now I'm having trouble making it initialize after the API call comes back and it should populate this with our categories so basically it's initializing too soon and it's not including what we need so I'm gonna we're probably not gonna work on that today today I'm gonna worry more about this down here going to change these and instead of cards they're gonna be more like full width sections with an image over here and then some text with the option of having even more text you can click and it would expand and show more text there so this is all based on my last meeting with the people that I'm making the site for and that's more of what they want they're not really fans of this this layout so let me check the the live chat before we get started so say I hey everybody I see someone asks when to use react j/s and I'm not sure how to pronounce that name because there's no vowels in it well unless you count the Y at the end so it's certainty I'm not sure what you're asking about when to use react j/s so if you could explain that a little bit more I'd be happy to answer but since there's not a lot going on in the live chat right now yeah yeah the theme just reminded me that Y is indeed about it is I almost almost forgot that for a second but I'm gonna go ahead and just get started so I have on a piece of paper I have a sketch of what I want this to look like so I haven't converted that to anything else but so you won't be able to see what I really wanted to look like until it starts to take shape other than you know my brief description of it so I'm gonna move this over and I think I'm a right now if you want to follow along with the repo we're on the branch that's called resource sorting so I pushed before this started I pushed everything up to github so it should be up to date I think I may do this UI stuff on this branch don't know let me know if there's any objections to that I don't I think it'll work I'd hate to I'd hate to start a new branch for this since I these kind of are gonna go together yeah I'll just do it on this branch okay I did have a question about the animation I had a couple questions about the UI so let me just do that first since this this is all about the UI anyway it makes sense to answer some questions about it right off the bat so the first question from Thomas are you using one component for each card yes so it's this is a component separate react component and they're just populated with data from the WordPress API so this is separate component and at a question about the animation for the checkboxes so this this little animation here oops I guess it doesn't work too well when i zoom in but that animation actually is from the materialized CSS framework and it's it's pure CSS it doesn't take any JavaScript or anything so if you want to use that actually if you want to use this animation without the entire materialized framework if you check out my code pen which I don't even I don't remember what the link is to that I'll have to I don't know maybe I'll have to find it real quick and put it in but basically I made a version of this that works pretty much the same way that doesn't use I don't it's just pure CSS it doesn't use JavaScript you don't have to download the whole framework so if anybody's interested in that I will I'll put that link in the chat in the description let me know otherwise I'm gonna take the time and bother with it okay cool maybe I will find that link hey Bill made it glad you could join us bill okay Thomas maybe the animation for the card reshuffling yes so the the animation is using a JavaScript plugin called masonry so this all does exist within one component called masonry so within that component I have all these other components for the cards but it's all wrapped in the one masonry component which I get to show you that here make this a little bigger there we go so within so you can see this is the masonry component everything Rhett is wrapped in that and then the cards are just produced within here so we had to do something cool was I think it was Fabien who did this pull request so I actually had someone submit a pull request that that perfected all of this because I could not get it working on a live stream the way I wanted it to so Fabien if you I don't know if he's joined in to the chat or not but he could probably talk even more about how this works well I have a lot of questions right off the bat it was okay so it's Anna's back hey how's it going glad glad you're back asked are you using git flow I'm not familiar with what git flow is so I'm assuming that I'm not using it okay you guys are hearing static let me see I'm gonna move my phone farther away because it could be from my phone I did have a fan on too but that's been off for a couple of minutes so it's probably not that if you're still hearing it Navan says hey i'm starting out a 100 days challenge free code camp challenge from the 10th of July 2017 how do I start it's vital I think for the hundred days of code I don't don't correct me if I'm wrong but people just start whenever they want right you can just pick your own personal date and then usually people post that you know they tweet out with the hash tag like hundred days of code so I don't know is there somewhere where there's like a an actual date like an official start date for that I don't know okay so then I explain about git flow which I've actually never heard of so I'm really glad that you are taking the time to explain this to me so it says we get flow you create small branches for every feature and then merge them with develop I asked you because I have to learn it for this new project okay yeah so okay cool I mean I don't I guess I don't actually like consciously use that concept of git flow I do try to do feature branches though but a lot of smaller features I don't bother making a branch on so not I wouldn't say that I'd do that exactly okay so let me get I really love all the action in the live chat and everybody contributing but I don't want to disappoint everyone who who came here for the code and not just to hear me so let me go you know what I am gonna start a new branch for this because I'm gonna like I'm gonna change a lot of stuff in here so this is you this is gonna be major so I'm just gonna make another branch I'll merge them eventually but just in case I mess something up I want to be able to go back to the sorting and filtering stuff that I was working on and have that work and not have to worry about some UI thing delaying that so let me bring over my I have my terminal here I'll blow it up a bit sorry I'm a little distracted I always play music in the background and my headphones and just every song that's come up since I started it I haven't liked so it's really annoying the sorry about that so I just want to check make sure there's nothing on here oh wait there's something on here I'm not sure what I did I really thought that I had everything alright doesn't even show hmm all right so I'm not exactly sure what I did to be able to commit so that stinks when that happens I could do get Fred oh I guess I fixed it great so it must have just been a line or something that I put in that shouldn't have been there so now that I know that I don't have anything left on this branch I'm gonna take this branch exactly where it's at and copy it into a new one so if you're making a new branch you can do and someone was it bill I can't remember I think it might have been bill in a previous show told me that you can just do get check out and then B and then name your branch and get and you'll automatically go into that branch which is awesome and save some time and prevents you from accidentally making changes on a the wrong branch so let's name this actually no I don't want to know the one that starts with resource so let's go new new resource you I I don't have a problem with long branch names because you end up never having to type them all out anyway you can just you know tab to autocomplete so why not have really long names so here we go so we're on this branch sweet new branches I just I like to go through that sometimes for those of you who are maybe not familiar with git so now that we're here I'm gonna pull this off to the side and now I can proceed to destroy this this component without fear because we can always just switch back to other branch so this is really gonna make me sad to remove this because this is just wonderful Fabian did an amazing job on this pull request and if somebody else did this pull request and I'm giving credit where it to the wrong person I'm really apologize for that but I'm pretty sure with Fabian and so I don't really need to I guess delete this right away because this is just a constant we're not rendering it yet but I need to come down here and at least start something where I want to put this let me uh I'm gonna pull this off to my other screen just quickly so I can see I think I want to try to do the new UI element right I'm gonna show you right here basically above this section so that these are still down there and like we can see the new ones I'd like to see them sidebyside and I still want this code right there for me to refer to easily so I'm not going to delete it yet it's just a matter of finding where that spot is this components way bigger than I would normally like a component to be okay so there's a search there's our tabs okay and here's where yep okay here's what we're inserting that so I can probably put a component in here and we'll just we'll test this out so what I want us to look like probably so I mentioned early I'm using the materialized framework so I'm gonna try to use their classes as much as possible so we don't have to do a lot of custom CSS and we'll see if it works and then if we need to edit it a bit then then we'll do that but it'll be a lot faster if we can use what's already built in to materialize so I'm gonna stick with they're calling classes I can use normally in react you have to use class name instead of class but I'm using a I always forget the name of it but you can check out the package.json file for this project on github and you can see it I'm using an NPM module that allows me to use just the normal HTML syntax I guess for for the HTML attributes so I can just use class so just wanted to say that in case it throws anyone off who's maybe used to react and that's a little weird to you so we're gonna use column s12 okay so since these are gonna be full with columns everything's just as siliceous means on a small screen size it's 12 columns and it's just gonna stay twelve columns on all screen sizes so within that we want to have an image and in text so I think what I want to do I think I'm actually gonna have some nested columns I mean that would be that would be the best here at least for now so I don't think I don't think I need to put this in a row and then more columns I'm just gonna try to put a column right in here I'm not sure what it'll do but it won't take long to test it out oops so let's do column and I want this to be should I make on a small stream I guess it can stack so we will do s 12 on a small screen but then on medium screens we want this to take up probably 25% of the screen we'll try 25% at first maybe I wanted to look slightly bigger than that but this should work for now and then within there we want to have an image and for now I'm just gonna put in just like a stock photo so my other screen I'm just gonna find a stock photo grab the URL and put it in so let's see if this one works and then our our next oops our next column is going to be where all the text is so we'll just put in some stuff here just so that we can get an idea of what it's going to look like just once again on small screens it's gonna be 12 oops cycling skills are not great today alright so we want small screens who want to be full with and then on medium screens we want this to take up the rest so this is gonna be nine columns materialise use just a twelve column system so as long as everything adds up to twelve then then you're good I guess you could go smaller than twelve if you want so you can't go more than twelve so within there let's just throw in just throwing something to see what its gonna look like and then we can adjust it later so I know we're gonna have a title and I don't know that I want H tags for everything else I think I'll just do spans and we'll just give them a class I want this to be author and let's just say it's me since I'm doing this right now and then I think what else what else do we have oh we have a type I'll just put that here for now I haven't decided for sure where we're gonna specify like what type of resource it is then we'll just say it's audio just pretend that I recorded an awesome song and that's the resource should be crazy I can't sing at all and then we'll just have a paragraph and I guess I'll give it a class oops that's not what I wanted we'll give it a class of the description and usually I'd like to give materialised comes with this this class called flow text which makes the the font size change depending on the screen width I normally go with that for text but I'm not for now I just want to see what it looks like without at first and if it's readable so for now I'm just gonna some lorem ipsum just because that'll be the fastest to do okay let's save that see what happens whoa and let me show you what happened this is so since I'm using masonry on this it's just all these cars just covered up everything that we did so that's no good also my image that was supposed to be Bill Murray just didn't work so two disappointments there wow that's Thanks so here's what I'm gonna do I am gonna have to take these out to make this work so let's remove yeah let's just remove this and that should give us what we need just to be able to see what's going on okay so that's that's roughly really really roughly what I was going for but I definitely want to see what it looks like with an image so oh I see why is not letting me so as it failed to get the resource so this is where I was getting it from me say this was supposed yeah it's supposed to work oh wait maybe I needed the HTTP maybe this just needs updated because it it's without the s all right let's try that so I should just need to add this and hopefully it'll work no still didn't work all right one more time before I put in all right oh well I just have to put in an image that I already have and I know we'll work so let me check my image folder I think all these images in this folder are huge actually let me check the live chat maybe one of you are seeing what's going on here and can help me out also I haven't checked the live chat a couple minutes I don't want to leave you all hanging Oh Naveen asked about with that dot filter and map were so let me okay it looks like Rohan gave a good answer to that so so awesome basically it's just a way to work with arrays so that you can filter out and only get the items that you want from an array map lets you just go through every item in array and do something you know with each item so you would use it maybe like in place of a for loop I see a couple of people's told me to do get DIF to see what changed so I I eventually remembered that okay there's a discussion about code editors which I love it like I wonder I don't know that I've ever done in a live stream without some discussion of code editors in in the stream just always we had somebody so Shaw says hey what's up this is my first time tuning in how are you doing I'm doing pretty good thank you so much for joining in for the for the live chat welcome oh no Torrance says things were not good today was a bad day I'm sorry to hear that hopefully things will get better maybe I hope you have a good experience with it within the live chat maybe that'll be that'll be something me something that's not bad in your day oh I'm bear to asked about image size constraints and that's a good question at one time I did have size constraints but I don't think it would apply I don't think it would apply to where I put this in here I think I had them somewhere up here at least I thought I did now I don't remember where I put the image size constraints but it is right at one time I had the constraints I'm not gonna really need to have constraints like I did before for this layout which is one of the reasons why we decided to go with this layout oh man denna says what about cores so cross what is the cross origin resource what's the S stand for I can't remember crossorigin resource sharing is that what it is anyway that might be it actually since I'm doing this from localhost it might be freaking out and not wanting me to it won't want to give me the the image so all right yeah so I won't work with that I won't mess with the image anymore yeah actually I'm not getting a coarse error in the console I'm just kidding I'm just getting an error I mean usually it says oh wait here we go it was just higher up in the console I was getting multiple errors for it yep you got it you all are right it is a Corsair so let me switch and just get a different image there is a way that you can I forget what the site is there's a way you can get around course errors I used it I was building the weather app from free code camps lessons and I used it to get around the dark sky API course issues but I can't remember what it was so I'm not gonna try to find it now I'm just gonna go to unsplash and I'm gonna grab just an image from there this should give me a random image I'm gonna have the random image one and sometimes I like doing the random image from unsplash shot I T because then you you don't get bored hopefully I don't get a Corsair with this one yes okay no coarser great so I mean probably the ideal image dimensions would not be this but it just gives us an idea of okay we have an image here we'll see how it's gonna work all right so this is the basic layout that I that I want now but now that you all can see what I was saying in my mind what I want is I don't know that I want it to be this tall so maybe a little bit smaller and the images that would then be smaller this description would be hidden by default and you'd be able to click to read the description so maybe it just might say read more you'd be able to click and then it would drop down and you'd be able to see it so they would basically be half this the height of this but then every item would just take up space in this row potentially I don't know if I'm gonna attempt this or not but potentially if a screen was wide enough there would be enough space that we could do two rows side by side but I don't want to mess with that because then I have to worry about the the rows being the same height and I just don't want to deal with that I know that there are ways like using flexbox to make sure they're the same height but at this point I only have until the 20th of this month to get all the features done for this site so you can see I have a Trello board with all the stuff that needs to get done and it's linked in the description and there's still quite a lot so that's gonna fall under probably like hey we'll do it if we have time but it's not 100% necessary so you know for most people something would I don't remember what the average screen size is but this is probably closer to but a lot of people would be seeing the audience for this site is not likely to have really awesome computers with giant screens so I should probably keep that in mind that I think this the screen I'm working on now is a 2k 20 I think it's 27inch screen so definitely not what people would normally have who would be our audience but anyway this is the the basic thing so now we're just gonna fine tune it a bit I want to get the UI completely like ready how we like it before I actually pull in the data and then have a lot of them stacked up so I might just once we get it to a point where it looks pretty nice then I'll I'll just copy like three of them just to see what they look like stacked up and we'll probably do some sort of really thin border between them and if everything is good then we'll plug in the data and and see how it looks my only fear is that it's gonna be a long list there's gonna be a long scroll associated which I mean it's kind of unavoidable you know because this I'm kind of stuck I can't go back to the old layout I'm a little bit stuck and that it needs to be pretty much like this this is what they want but hopefully with all these categories and options and search anything can be narrowed down enough so that there won't be too many items here all right so I'm gonna continue on with this if you have any questions at this point if you're lost or there's something you really didn't understand about what I'm doing let me know right now oh I'm gonna take a drink really quick and then I'm gonna check the live chat before we move on and continue styling this okay so someone did ask about saying use classname so Jonathan said replace class with class name so I explained this a little while ago but maybe Jonathan joined in after that so just really quick you notice I'm using class here and I'm not getting errors it actually works I have a plugin that lets me use class normally you can't use class with react but it's X it's really useful to be able to use it if you're copy and pasting HTML which in this case I do somewhat frequently from the materialised documentation so it's really helpful to not have to change class the class name so this was from some of the old code before I had that plugin and I didn't install that plugin someone else installed it so let me bring up I like to show this from time to time just so I can give everyone credit for their contributions so here's the contributors to the repo so I'm trying to think who I think it was Danny that actually submitted a request a pull request and installed that plugin so thanks Danny for that so if you want your github profile featured on this show then submit a pull request how's this I don't expect anyone to take time out of their day to contribute to this project but if you would like to and you have the time then uh it's really nice I'll appreciate it and you know as long as it improves the project somewhat then you know I'll pull it in okay so let me let me check the the live chat quickly and then we'll move on ah raj area is says he's watching this in one 144p can't even read the code really sorry that you have to watch it in 144p so i'll if you're still tuned in and haven't just gotten frustrated and left I'll try to be as descriptive as possible and what I'm saying even though you can't see it that well that really stinks I'm sorry about that I don't I mean I don't think I could do anything about that it's it's you know the internet connection at the other end but oh man Turin tour I mentioned earlier that they're having a really bad day and I don't know if they want me to read off what they said so I'm not gonna read off what they said but it just seems like they're having a really really bad day so if you're still here I'm really really sorry I'm available on Twitter if you want to direct message me and if you need to talk about anything I'm here for you so that's things sometimes I myself have battled with clinical depression since I was probably 17 or 18 I mean and I'm 31 now so I definitely understand when when you get down so I'm here for anybody that ever needs to talk about that or anything cuz it can be rough I'm not a counselor though so this is not like official medical advice or anything it's just somebody who's been through it so Danis Anton says will you cover setting up a register slash login not on this project I won't need to in this project but possibly on future projects I will need to do that so I can't guarantee I can't give you a time yet because I'm not entirely in control of my schedule it's whatever my bosses want me to work on so but I can definitely foresee in the future me having to do that on some some potential projects that I know are in the works so maybe one day potentially I could maybe just do a video like on my own channel pre record something to go over registration login maybe I'll add that to my list of of topics or potential topics for videos alright so I'm going to I'm just going to get started I know there's some more questions in the live chat I'll get to those later on if you're if you've asked a question and you can stick around till the end I'll answer all the questions if you can't stick around you could always I'll answer it you know you can watch the recording later on or you can message me on Twitter or put it in the comments and then I can get to it later on all right Dana Stanton asked what my channel is the link I have a link in the description for this video I actually can't even remember what the with the address is right now it's probably just my name but oh but it's in the description so okay here's what I'm thinking that we ought to do I kind of think this title is just a little bit too big so maybe I'll drop this down into an h4 it's an h3 right now so we'll drop this down to an h4 these need to be on two different lines and it might be maybe I might want them to be a different color we'll see well mess with maybe making them this red color also I have this kind of goldish color that might work we'll see how sometimes the gold there isn't really that readable so we'll see but it might work I think it'd be nice to have at least one of these be different color and then we'll have to hide this and then put in a little button that will show it and we'll probably want to do some sort of animation so that it looks just a little bit more smooth maybe not even I mean we might just do like a little transition or something nothing fancy I think that's that's probably it also will probably want to do something with a salmon suit right now the the height of this is obviously being set by the image right so if I want this to be shorter what I ideally what I want is the height of this to not be set by the image but instead to be set by the text so we'll have to adjust the styles for this image so that you know it isn't always taking up this full height here and then finally we're gonna have a little border probably web you know like a bottom border alright so that's the that's the plan right now so let's go back to the code so first things first let's drop this down to an h4 also we need to make something in here linked so potentially the title could be a link so I'm gonna just make it a link right now and I just want to see what color it makes this link automatically I think the default right now is blue I don't want the title to be I don't think I want the title be blue we'll see what it looks like but it's really not a part of the color scheme for this so we'll probably end up making it maybe this red color and then yeah I want this to be oops not class style and now if you're not familiar with how to do Styles and react one way to do it is to put it in line as a JavaScript object so in react when you're in this is called JSX this kind of HTML looking stuff in here so if you want to put JavaScript in the middle of it you just put it a little curly bracket and then now anything between these these first curly brackets is JavaScript so now that I've put another set of curly brackets that's just an object and so within that object we can put CSS attributes but we have to camelcase them so for instance if we wanted to put like font weight we'd have to do it like like that instead of the normal hyphenated CSS selector okay so this is just one way to do it there are many different ways to do CSS in react but this is just one so for this one I'm just gonna do color and I need to grab a hex code so I'm just going to pull on my other screen I'm gonna pull up dev tools just so I can grab that same color that is in the footer and that's the hex code we're working with so you want to make sure that you put in in this case I'm using single quotes but you could probably use double quotes and it wouldn't matter you know the actual value of the attribute you want to put inside quotes if you just have just a plain number it will probably work without the quotes but I just put everything in quotes for consistency if you wanted to do something else you just put a comma and then put another attribute and you could just go on just just like you would normally do a JavaScript object so let's what else did we want to do oh we wanted to make these actually mean let me see I if I do oops not distribute displayblock I think this will make the other thing pop down on to a separate line so we wanted to do that so we've made that a different color let's just try out that gold color I don't really have much hope that it will work I think it's gonna end up being too hard to read but we'll give it a shot so let me grab the gold color once again on my other screen just from dev tools okay so that's our gold color and then for this let's go displaynone for now oops and then finally for the image let's go with I'm not sure what is the one right now I know for sure I want the height to be Auto but I'm not sure that'll fix our problem right now because if the width is said yeah we'll see I'll just leave it for that now I'm I'm doubtful that that'll fix it but yeah and it's true it didn't fix it but let me see what this did let me show you show you what this did okay so as I thought blue is the default color for a link I don't think we're gonna keep blue I mean you you you all can tell me what you think but I just don't think that this color blue really goes with the color scheme as you can see you know we're kind of that like a black black you know this dark red and white and then I really only kind of accent color that we've used as this gold this actually is way more readable than I thought it would be so I think I might keep it I was worried it would be hard to read I'll have to try it out on maybe some screens that aren't as highresolution just to make sure but for now I'm okay with that I definitely want to change this color and I think make it the red color and I don't know that I like these being two different colors so maybe this will be this will either be red or the the gold and then the other two will be the opposite color the paragraph will end up being just the regular font color which i think is black with an opacity of 87% okay so I'm gonna open up dev tools and I'm gonna inspect this really quick so I can see what's going on with the image and let me bring it over so I hate to do too much on the other screen where you can't see wow that's an issue check check that up that's just going right over so we definitely don't want that I'm not sure maybe this is because we tried to nest columns and maybe that's not the right way to do it so I'm not gonna worry about this right now we'll wait until we do a bit more but we'll have to fix that but I did want to see yeah I kind of like how that stacks it's not not too bad but let me make this a lot bigger for you all here's our image and we can see in dev tools all the properties here what I'm really worried about here is width and height so I'm assuming that the width is set to I don't know what a hundred percent maybe the width not set at all it doesn't look like it's even set so let's just you know let's play around a bit and see what we can do oops I can't okay so if we set it to a hundred it actually looks better here but it's not gonna look better when we make it bigger so it's gonna look worse okay so we don't want it to be a hundred I actually want the images my idea for images is that all the images will be in this upper lefthand corner and then whatever their normal sizes they'll remain that size unless they're bigger than I want in which case though they'll have to be a maximum size so it'd be something like max width would be a hundred percent so I would never want it to be you know bigger but potentially could be smaller so maybe really I could probably set I could set a maximum height because we'll know as long as the titles don't get huge I mean four it would have to be for each break point we would have a different maximum height but I'm gonna think about what I want to do there for now let's sort this out with kind of what I said a few minutes ago and get that looking how we want it to look and we need a border here and then I'd like to duplicate it a few times to see what it looks like stacked and then also we need a button to show that that description all right so we'll work on that now actually let me look let me check back in with the live chat because it's been it's been a few minutes I don't want to miss too much okay yeah danish anton subscribed to my mind chant my personal channel so thank you thank you for that i don't want i haven't been able to put up as many videos that i had planned I'm just been busier than I thought so sorry about that but I hope to put up some some nice you know short tutorial videos on there as soon as I can alex says materializes to puck and bootstrap is biggie so if you're familiar with 90s American rap feuds then you'll know what that refers to but I think everybody knows Tupac and Biggie right if you don't there are just two famous rappers that had feuds which may or may not have been legit I always have my doubts about celebrity feuds I think most of them are orchestrated to increase publicity but I did I never took sides in that phew okay bill says the trick I've heard is if you make everything monochrome with an overlay using maybe Photoshop and can't read something then the design colors might need to be changed cool I've never heard that that's that's a good good trick Rogerio says I know nothing about next Jay asks would you mind tell me in short what it is what it's about and actually it's some people and the live chat gave some good answers to that just my short answer to next jazz is it's a way to very quickly start building with react and have serverside rendering built in routing built in so you don't have to set that up you don't have to worry about setting up web pack comes with hot module reloading so you can very very quickly start using react without having to learn a lot of the other stuff that at least in my experience slowed me down a lot at first so there are plenty of other awesome things about next Jas but for me at least this that's kind of the core of what's what's great about it okay so Alex is the blue is not working I definitely agree Alex asks about how how I got my code editor to show the color of the hex so this is I'm using Adam from github and it's just a plugin I don't remember I'm sorry I don't remember what the plugin is but it was just a plugin for the code editor to show the the colors as anna says if they had a color scheme to stick with at least you could blame them if it didn't pass an accessibility audit yeah that's true I really have no control over this color scheme at this point so this was the color scheme that I inherited when I took over this the development of the site so a lot of decisions had already been made if you've been watching from like the start of this when I started this site there was already a partially completed site that I was starting from and I had to I didn't have to keep all of it but I did have to keep some of the design elements and the color scheme I definitely had to keep all right so I've got through everything in that in the live chat for the most part so let's get back to this okay lol Brito says Adam the Adam package is called pigments for the hex colors so thank you very much for for putting that in the in the chat so if anybody's interested in getting their getting colors here pigments is the package for Adam I'm sure there are similar packages for other code editors so let's change that that color and let's see I'm just gonna copy this since this is pretty much what we want I don't need this part though just copy that and I'm gonna use this color here I also want to increase the font size of both of these as these start to get bigger in terms of you know adding more CSS in this I like to put them down in here in this style JSX tag so at some point I'll probably do that but for now it's just a lot less scrolling and it's probably easier for you all to see if I put it in here so if it gets really huge and unmanageable I will move it down but for now I think it'll be fine so let's go with font size and I'm not sure what font size we have now but I think I'm gonna I'm gonna see what 18 pixels looks like oops if I can type 18 there we go let's put it here as well might look nicer if these are a little bit different but for now we'll just try it also we need a button right so I'm not sure if I want an actual you know button or just some text for now it'll be easiest to just put some text we'll just say give it a class of read more for now and I'll just say read more and I guess we could do you give it an onclick in I was just thinking for a second if I could fit everything I wanted this to do right into here if I should just make a different function we'll see I don't have to think about it right now for now though I just want to hmm I think how I should how a lot to do this I guess I'll have to say that right now so we're just doing the u.s. stuff right now so I shouldn't I shouldn't be mixing in this this stuff of right now it'll just slow us down let's see we wanted finally we wanted a a border right so what his style and I'm gonna do a border bottom and let's do I want it to be really thin so I think I'm just gonna go two pixels at first see how that looks and we want it to be solid and I think I would like it to be some type of gray maybe I'll just use whenever I need to make an RGB color instead of typing it out myself I just come in here and I think if I made it 54 I can change it but basically if I do it like this then I don't have to type it up and I can preview the colors so occasionally it saves me some time so let's put that in there and I'm gonna try 54 let's see how that looks oops well alright so we had the border didn't do anything at all right now I don't need that in there also I need to make this okay there we go while two pixels this way that's way thicker than I wanted we're gonna have to go down to one pixel actually I don't really mind this right now at least we in the same color I think they may be you should be closer to here so we need to decrease the padding for that title tag and then we need to increase the padding between these two because the serene more should be down here the read more right now it doesn't indicate at all that it's clickable so we need to make that have a better indication of click ability and we'll make this smaller so let's drop this down to one pixel and let's say we did it paddingbottom I think it's patting your nut margin we'll find out in a second here oops paddingbottom and we'll do let's see if eight pixels will be too much okay so that thickness there that I like that that's not too bad I'm not I'm not sure that I like it being all the way across like that I don't know if it needs to be we'll see how it looks though whenever we get more on there maybe it'll look better so that padding didn't do anything so maybe it's a margin thing it is it's a margin oops and I put it I actually put it on the a tag which which wouldn't do anything anyway all right so let's take this take this off and on the actual H tag will do marginbottom and we'll try eight pixels I'm not sure that did much of anything did it yeah that's so the exact amount all right let's try oh it's not why is it not doing anything that's odd all right we'll drop that down then a half I guess okay all right that brought it up a bit I guess it's okay let's share this font size and then we brought it up to 18 but I think 20 might be even better yeah like 20 all right so I must have the worst Spotify playlist ever playing right now on my headphones I normally don't mess with Spotify at all during the streams cuz but I have to change this it's just it's just not it's the new music Friday playlist for this Friday on Spotify and it's just not great today so I'm gonna change that all right let me I'm gonna check the live chat since it's been a while okay not much going on in the live shows I haven't missed that much Oh Alex said that Adam always crashes so I had to switch back to sublime so that's things I've never used sublime I've seen people on YouTube using sublime it it looks like a nice code editor okay Sebastian says color highlighter works for sublime so if you're using sublime and you want the hex colors color highlighter it will work yeah bill Cicero music really throw you off your game for sure I like it just makes it so much harder to focus when the music is annoying to you jack says Jessie sounds like Evan Peters to me now I can't separate the two of them in my head I don't know who Evan Peters is who's Evan Peters does not want to listen to them and see if he sounds like me all right so let's go back and see what else we need thought we need to work on this read more hmm well for sure the read more needs to be a different color I'm running out of colors of highlight colors I guess I'm gonna have to make this one red well we don't really have any other colors that are already being in use unless something to go back to the blue or pull in some entirely different color so we'll make this red we will make it so that your cursor looks like a link cursor so let's do that okay so you want the color to be I couldn't just copy and pasted this whole thing here oh wow and cursor cursor pointer this has been the most CSS heavy stream I've done for a long time so if you were here for a lot of JavaScript sorry but I know a lot of people really wanted more CSS stuff at least a while back there are a lot of people that wanted more CSS that were kind of a little lost with all the react stuff so hopefully some of them are watching and are getting something useful out of this all right so this is more like what we want oh we wanted to add some padding there so let's do this we'll do a margin margin top let's dress 16 pixels and see what that looks like that's weird didn't do anything this didn't look like anything that's weird nice because it's not yeah I didn't set it to displayblock that's my fault okay that's better yeah I don't know if it needs to be 16 but for now that'll work okay I wondered I guess it's not it looked like this was indented a bit but I think it's just because it's a t just looked indented which I didn't I don't want it to be indented so I don't know I don't know that I like audio being here maybe I'll have to think maybe there's a better place I think it might look nicer if it was title and then author and then this was somewhere else so I wouldn't I actually wouldn't even be opposed to using icons because our options are either going to be video text or audio you know we could definitely find pretty straightforward icons for each one I don't know if I want to go through finding icons right now it's not I guess it's not that difficult okay all right at this point I think I would like to see what a few of these look like stacked together so let's try that before we get any further oh man okay that looked terrible at first but it's just because the images didn't load that doesn't look too bad was everyone thing actually looking at right now I think the image section could be larger there's a ton of space over here you know we have multiple ones I could just try to you just change one of them and see what it looks like compared to the other ones so we can make this 4 and this 8 and then we'll try a different one so we'll make this 5 and this 7 and then we'll leave the other one as it was just to get an idea ok so let's see we'll have a vote lay out 1 2 or 3 or none of them and do something else now we will these are a little bit short so I guess you know the title is gonna probably gonna take up a decent amount of space so maybe it would look better if if it was actually filled out I'm gonna do that for this one as well so I'll give everyone in the live chat a minute to to add weigh in on this decision if you can if you want to and I'll I'll put in some more data okay it just occurred to me I don't know why I just occurred to me that I ought to actually put like author and then have something here so that people will know that it's the author actually this doesn't look nearly as bad now that it has a longer and longer title I'm gonna check the live chat see what you all think okay Patrick says we could stagger the images left and right bill likes the stagger idea Sebastian says too much space maybe more spacing between the bottom border and next section Andrew likes number one layout one manish says none of them it's too much space rohan says three looks best but also a vertically center the text blog Phillip says way too much space on all of them Sebastian says Center the image inside of the div if possible Phillip says there's a lot of margin on the right of the image patrick says plus one for author label Genesis I think you need some margin top on the border okay cool all right so if we vertically center the text that'll take care of the margin top thing for the most part unless we have something with insanely long title that rats so let's do that first so let's see if we take let's take this and make it give it a class of feline rapper and then no wait I don't want that to be I want this to have the class of vline rapper and I probably could do it for all of them so okay and then within this we can make it V line all right let's see if that works so materialized comes with some vertical alignment stuff built in that's really helpful because you don't have to mess with it so here's what it looks like if the text is vertically aligned okay they were saying the image almost sits on the border yeah you're right we need to do something about the image actually let's try this the image there's no reason the image couldn't be vertically aligned as well I'll shut on this one first and then what if we set the height to always be no I don't know if this will work but we'll see let's see I might need I might need to use something more absolutely yeah that's not going to work to see if this would work okay so the vertical alignment would work but yet we still need some sort of padding because potentially if it was this small it would be it would come right up there so actually we could probably just do give this section this whole section a bit of padding yeah let's do that okay so let's just do do these big sections here and we'll give them give them awesome padding oops let's just give them a little padding for now see how that looks I don't know I think it needs more and perhaps a bit more padding which I try to double it okay not quite as bad are we getting it's a little off I think we it's throwing it off the alignment because this title has its own margin at the top yeah so that's throwing everything off I'm gonna take away the top margin from the title so that it's not throwing because right now it very Clea looks like it's down a bit lower than it should be if we were trying to Center it completely because we have this invisible space up here that's adding height to this element so I'm going to take that out and then we should get a truer vertical line so where's that all our H fours okay there we go so that gives us a better vertical line the only one that looks weird this one looks weird because it doesn't have any border yeah every all the other ones look like they have a top and a bottom border but you know it's really just the bottom border for all of them so I don't know maybe it would look better if there was a border on the top just for the first one oops border tough okay I don't know if it makes it look better but at least they get a better idea of what these this padding looks like I'm gonna go back to the live show just to check in with everyone okay Santa asks would you have text in there on the right and I hadn't thought of that but now that I see it and I see all this space that actually would be well actually I will say like none of the titles are gonna be so let me let's get an idea of what the average title is going to be anyway cuz I would I think most of the titles are pretty long so we're not actually gonna have a lot of space here but let's I'm gonna go to the live site okay so yeah all right some of the titles are kind of short some of them are longer you know this one is definitely definitely a bit longer I don't want to click the link okay so anyway so yeah I mean if we were gonna have everything be this short I think it would be good to put text here I just know that so the people are making this a four seem to really like long titles like really long titles so that's been it's been difficult for me to try to fit in all these titles I have a lot of like wrapping of text going on where it shouldn't be so I'm just trying like thinking it is likely that the titles for these things will end up being huge especially once they see how much more space they have here than they did in the the cards and even this author thing is not necessarily even going to be someone's name it could potentially be like multiple names so if this is a video with more than one person or a book with more than one person I mean this could end up being like four names and if you look some of the names are crazy because it's not just a name to name Plus like all the degrees that they've had after that so I'm thinking that this space is more than likely going to be taken up actually once we pull in the real data it'll be way easier to see that so for now I am gonna leave a space here and then when we pull in the data if we find that we're still having a decent amount of space then maybe we could put a small amount of text there but I definitely want four just so that users don't have to scroll too much I would like these to be shorter rather than taller so it's thing obviously once it gets down you know to where these stack that has to change because there's no way they'll be able to stack properly I don't know hmm I'm actually not entirely sure that they should stack when it gets lower I mean there'd be some crazy text wrapping going on but now let's see what this looks like okay that's more reasonable I think if I Center that image that that actually is more reasonable so maybe they ought to stack I think actually like I looked better here on a smaller more narrow screen than on the large one the title I gave this is just nonsense and ridiculous but in that font it just it looks like impressive doesn't it well you could write anything in this font and it would look impressive all right let's see Oh Roland's going to sleep thanks for thanks for watching and thank you thanks for contributing I appreciate it it's a what is it about two o'clock in the morning where you're at so that's awesome for staying up that late just just for this l Bri so says what about two per row yeah we talked about two per row earlier that's still potentially an option I don't want to make a decision on the two per row until I actually get the real data in here and see how much space is being taken up and then oh I think we'll have a much better feel for just how much you know extra space we have because even with this I mean I could move this over more I suppose but it would still you know this is a really wide screen let me move this screen down into what a more normal screen would be so I guess a more normal desktop screen would end up being like this so so looking at it from this perspective this actually looks a lot nicer and more balanced so I haven't checked the analytics for a while but I don't think we get many users that have really wide screens so even as we go out I mean even getting into this with you know that's that's still reasonable we're getting a bit more white space but it would definitely you know it's reasonable and it would be tough to squeeze it in to too but I definitely want to do something about these images because I really have no idea what dimensions the images are going to be in there could be all different ones so I don't want to make assumptions about what the image is going to be like or design based on a certain image dimension because it could totally change so all we all we want to do with images is just set maximum maximum Heights that they could be I guess that's all we're really worried about so that's what I'm gonna do so I'm gonna look check the height of this image and just get let's get a feel for like what what is the biggest image that would make sense here you know how big do we want this like I'm thinkin I I guess I really don't want it to be wider than this or taller than this I mean that that's honestly even a little bit taller than I think I would 1 so what if the max image height would be like maybe 200 is this decent for now I think I'm gonna set it at 200 I'm gonna set it at 200 and then let's put in the real data and just see what it looks like and then the streams been going on for what at least two hours now so that's it so well let's put in the data see what it looks like and then kind of wrap things up maybe make a bit some more adjustments but I think we got I mean it's definitely way different than it was from the start so and it's a lot closer to what I had sketched on paper so it definitely needs some work I'm not I'm not happy with it as it is now but it definitely gives me a good idea I like to see that I think it might be good to like sleep on it and come back tomorrow and or what's Friday I'll come back on Monday and hopefully my subconscious will have worked on this over the weekend yeah all right so let's go back I do want to put this Mac site in for the images right now and I'm only gonna put this let's see which one did we want to keep actually I think I want to keep the spacing for this one now that I see it with a longer title so this will be the one that we keep so let's put in max height of 200 pixels it's crazy I keep glancing at the analytics for the video and it's crazy like as the video goes on the viewership just drops off I guess it makes sense you know like everybody gets the notification at first and they check it out so I mean that's the big burst but like we've dropped like half of the amount of years we had you know like in the first half an hour I'm not complaining about it I'm just like observing that it's interesting like you know that we get I'm just always interested in certain times during the video it picks up and it drops off and I just I've no idea why you know there are different patterns I guess and in the people viewing alright so we don't need these anymore so I do want so for now I'm gonna leave this like this but obviously I'm gonna make this its own component you know and it's it's going to be a separate file and a separate component but for now just to test this out we'll just leave it all here what I want to do is I want to give this a class so I can put more easily put the padding top I want to move I want to move a bunch of these styles down not right now but let's give it a class of resource resource row I guess they're all rows now so that kind of makes sense the code a resource row and then down here I'm just going to do one thing research will i always forget what these are what is it first I'll just look it up I think there's like a first of type and a first I guess I guess first of type is what I want right this don't use these often enough to to remember them and now we want to give this the border I'm gonna copy this this is what we want you so much gonna copy this part there we go okay let's make sure I didn't pull out anything really important okay cool so we have the border at the top great all right now let's put this so here's what we want we want to drop down into JavaScript now and we want to get this state data and then we want to map that right and we map that we're going to call it will just call this it's been call each one resource right usually I just call it post let's go I'll just call cocos2d consistent with everything else that I have going on so we can use this arrow function and this will just return all of this so now within post we can get obviously this will eventually be an image URL I kind of want to leave this in for now just so we get an idea of what it looks like with images now you know what I'm going to change it because not everything is gonna have an image so I do want to see what they look like without images and if it looks good interspersed with some that do have images so let me get I have the this is what the the data is gonna look like so we'll have where's our image okay so we need to do a CF URL I'm gonna put this on my other screen so I can see it as where as I'm putting it in so for source it's actually gonna be we're gonna have to do some logic in here so it's gonna say post dot a CF has a zone property I think that's what it's called has been property now you know what it is gonna have URL no matter what let me check this up no I don't want I'm sorry I thought it was gonna be a CF URL it's gonna be better featured image so what I want to say is post better featured image and then I want to make sure that it's not equal to null it's not equal to null then I want to put in I want to use the post better featured image otherwise this is gonna look terrible for now and I need to do it what I need to do is is check this all somewhere else and then just put it in for now unless I can just copy it quickly I might still have it up here then you just copy it to the resource card I don't know what's working how was that I guess I was annoying it like that I was thinking that if I just added a blank source that it would give me that weird little box that says there's no image so we'll just leave it like that for now we'll leave it like this for now and what else do we need we need the title so let's with a curly bracket we're gonna go into JavaScript land here and let's get post ACF and actually it's just title post title rendered so we have that and now for the for the author it's just thing about the author not all of them have an author yet so I am gonna have to check first so what we do want it to say is we wanted to say author and then a space then we want to check and see post ACF has property and if it says author then we're going to use post otherwise we're not going to do anything and for this we're gonna do post whoops gonna go into JavaScript toast dot ACF dots type and then although we're not using this right now may as well put it in I mean it's all it's hidden for now and for this one since it could potentially have HTML in it I want to do dangerously set inner HTML I can use this and be confident with it because the data I'm being it's being pulled in is from WordPress a wordpress installation I have control of it's not a good idea to pull in data this way from sources that you don't have control of because potentially you know harmful stuff could get pulled in so use with caution obviously because it's just dangerously set it but we're gonna live dangerously today and put in put this in and let me think is it trying to remember how this is yeah I think that's what it how you do it oops I just I just noticed the typo sorry title there we go post AC is a VCF yeah description okay and that's what we need for now oops I'm sorry I forgot one very important thing we need the URL and that's gonna be post dot a CF dot URL and then let's go ahead and put in a title tag we'll just do post a CF our post title rendered there we go now I'll save it and let's see what happens getting a long refresh here let me restart my dev server cuz it seems like I messed it up luckily this only takes about three seconds all right so we did have a problem and this was where I went to set dangerously set innerhtml so let's see I know that I've dangerously said it somewhere else so I'm just gonna look at where I did it elsewhere and copy that there we go oh okay I forgot another set of brackets I was kind of thinking I needed another set of Arrakis I think I don't know if you can hear that on here but I just heard thunder outside and I didn't bring my umbrella today so I was gonna bring my umbrella and then one of my daughter's said I want to use the umbrella so I let her have the umbrella so now I'm I'm umbrella this for today okay so I'll shoot I need to dangerously set innerhtml in these titles so that these characters look right but other than that shoot I forgot to since I'm on localhost I can't pull in images from WordPress either so that won't let me so maybe it actually it doesn't look terrible it looks a little weird for the for ones without images here's an idea suit you think what if the image was on this side then the text would be over here so if there wasn't an image which is likely for some of them that they're not going to be an image it wouldn't it wouldn't look offset so like if there was an image here then this one would what do you think what do you think about that I'm gonna check the live chat since I haven't checked in well anyway but I would like to know if we moved it so that images appear too over here with that would that be okay now what I think about it I think it might okay bill says maybe add some styling to an HR tag to have it fade on the left and right side that's a great idea I hadn't I can't believe I didn't even think of an HR tag instead of a border that that's a really good idea thanks for that bill sebastien acts where the text will go when you click read more this will just get bigger and there'll be text here and then there'll be an option to to minimize it again Zanna says give them say like 10 10 vh for the for the image height okay yeah I do I like going with using VH if you're not familiar the VH is its viewport height so if I said 10 viewport height as the image height then it would take up like 10 percent of the current the height of the viewport in the same way with VW you port with and it works the same way Philip s can you render serverside with react if you are you if you're using go I don't know I've never used it with go I they're not not read anything about that so I'm sorry but I can't I can't really give you an accurate answer for that Nathan caught the title spelled wrong before I did so sorry I didn't I didn't look over at the live chat but thanks for pointing that out Athan bill says if there's no author will it say author no actually long as I was typing that out I thought it probably shouldn't say authors should just be nothing I can make it so that author is a required field if I want to but I don't think I really want to because you know maybe they don't I mean I think everything would have to have somebody that made it but just in case I should make it so that nothing would show up instead of author okay Andrew says image on the right would be better okay bill says that he has the an allow control origin star which is like all chrome plugin to let me get around the localhost course issues but it says we're to word to the wise disable that when done or you will have headaches okay that's actually that might be useful for this project Andrew asks what the client is going to input data with in WordPress so the client will be the content management system for all this is WordPress and then it gets pulled in here okay so I think I'm gonna wrap things up now cuz it's been a pretty long stream we're at two and a half out oh I forgot I started this dream late so we're not into an effort we're actually only about two hours I started a half hour later than normal but it's still a really long stream at two hours so I think I think I'm going to wrap it up here I'm gonna go back through the live chat and make sure I didn't miss anything right now and miss any questions if if you don't want to stick around for the question questionandanswer session that we're about to have then thanks for watching and I'll see you next week thanks thanks for being involved in the live chat otherwise if you're gonna stick around you have any questions put them in the live chat or you can put them in the comments to this video or if you're shy you can direct message me on on Twitter my the link to my Twitter profile is in the description below and I'm definitely gonna take into account all everything that you all said whenever I work on this and decide and then once I get this down then I'll show it to everyone else involved in this project and they'll there may be some some other things because that need to change based on that but a decent work I'm I'm satisfied that you know with with the basics that we got here today this is looking a lot closer to what it will end up being okay so I'm gonna go back through the live chat quickly if and it looks like I've kept up with the live chat pretty well so I don't think there's a lot that I need to catch up on so it won't take me too long so if you have any questions put them up there quickly okay I saw weight really early on like right at the beginning we were talking about the 100 days of code challenge and I had I had said I thought you can just start whenever you want but I wasn't sure and I didn't notice before but Zanna says yeah you can just start coding whenever and just keep it going for a hundred days so thanks for that answer sorry I didn't see it earlier but and I'm not I'm not sure if the person that asked about it is even in here anymore Navin or Naveen I'm not sure how to pronounce your first name so sorry if I'm mispronouncing it but that's who asked the question initially but the hundred days of code is a really cool concept I actually haven't done it yet I should do it because I I i usually code usually I try not to I usually take Sundays off and if I do any code it's like fun stuff like I'm working on a game with my oldest son so I'll code that but other than that I code pretty consistently Monday through Saturday so I should just do it okay still going through nothing new in the live chat so I think I covered most of it okay there was still I think I mentioned before there was some discussion about code editors and I kind of skipped over it at the time but it seems like some people are saying the consensus always seems to be that Adam is slow at least slower than all the other editors that everyone uses so the alternatives that were mentioned were Visual Studio code brackets and sublime okay here's a question so Thomas asked in terms of workflow what would you suggest to beginners in react as on how to start their site creation should think of the different components based on wire framing or use a specific approach yeah I mean I suppose it depends on what would you already are used to in which you like but if you're starting like from a wireframe then yeah you could you could actually just take you know either within whatever program you're using or even if you print it out and are just a sketch you can just draw a boxes around everything and each each thing that you could draw a box around could be its own separate component usually it's a good idea to try to make the components so that they only do one thing so the smaller you can break down components it's normally better so as far as specific approach I I don't know of any approaches maybe there are but I mean I don't know like if there's any official approaches to to starting a project like that okay as Anna said she found a really nice tutorial for react and it was called react Jas tutorial number one react.js JavaScript introduction and workspace setup on youtube so if you search for that on YouTube I haven't seen it yet so it's not really an official endorsement but XANA seems to be pretty knowledgeable from what from all the contributions to the live chat so it's probably a pretty legit video under the watcher asks are you saving the stream yeah the stream will be available just a few minutes after it ends it's available to watch the recording so if you can't if you didn't catch the entire stream or if you can't stick around for the whole stream or especially there there are people that just this time of day because the time zones it's just it doesn't work for them to watch it or because of even if the time zone thing is not a big deal they're working or something at this time so there's a lot of people that do watch the recording well I appreciate when when you make the effort to be in the live chat if you can so it's really nice to have everybody's contributions Rogerio asks I don't think he's in here anymore but maybe he'll watch the recording are you developing on top of WordPress I think I mentioned this at some point but yeah the content management system is WordPress but what I'm working with right now is is react so it's two separate servers that are actually running these sites and I just use WordPress for the content management and I pull the data with the WordPress API into react so all the display stuff the UI everything that he user sees is is react okay side Siberian well there's more to the name I'm just gonna say Siberian for short says offtopic question bootstrap versus foundation I know I don't really use bootstrap or foundation often actually I just help someone out with one of their projects last night someone had watched the livestream yeah I've chat yesterday and I had mentioned that they could direct message me to help out so they did and gave me a link to the project and it was using foundation and I haven't worked with foundation for a really long time so that was kind of cool and interesting too I just read through the docs a little bit and I think ended up fixing the problem I haven't heard back from them though so hopefully I fix the problem so that's like the most experience I've had with foundation a long time in with bootstrap the last time I used bootstrap was probably when I went through like the very first part of the free code campaign sorry let me take this call really quick it's just gonna be a few seconds hello yes I'm still here are you are you leaving now okay yeah if you could that would be awesome sorry I didn't come over yeah I'll be I'll hope you hear Thanks all right right sorry about that but here's the the time where I give the usual speech here this shows about me doing my normal work every day so interruptions like phone calls happen and that's okay because I want people to see what my life as a frontend developer is so so interruptions are welcome so anyway there's a lot of talk in the live chat about foundation versus bootstrap so I'm gonna skip over since I am not familiar that much with either one of them especially with any like new developments with them I'm not really gonna weigh in Rogerio asks so I need a framework like that to use react with WordPress er is it optional so he's talking about do I need a framework like next j/s which I'm assuming a framework like next yes and no you don't really I've used you could you could use just plain react set up yourself or any type of scaffolding that like create react app or you know anything there's a ton of different scaffolding options for react so no you don't really need to next yes just makes it really easy to pull in data and render it serverside but it's not impossible certainly to do it without next okay so we did have a couple other like CSS frameworks mentioned so I'll just mention them as well XANA mentions skeleton it's a really light framework so I haven't checked out skeleton for a long time but I remember being impressed with how lightweight it was I'm when I made it was probably a few years ago last time I checked it out also I think there's one other one I saw mentioned Oh many dot CSS I have I haven't checked so bill bill says many dot CSS I have no experience with that but I guess it's a really bill so it's really lightweight I just saw that comment that Jack made earlier about me sounding like Evan Peters and I still don't know who Evan Peters is so if anybody knows telling me please I'm not really that worried about it but it would be cool if if I actually do sound like that person it would be fun to to listen and compare I kept looking through again and it looks like I miss actually two people said that they think two per row would make sense for our resources so I am gonna keep that in mind if you missed I explained a little more towards the beginning of the video why I might do two per row but some reasons why I might not and it's gonna end up being one of those things that may happen if I have time but the way things are going I don't think I'm gonna have time to do anything extra to this right now there's just a lot that needs done before I need to be done with this project Oh Samson said I'm late again so I didn't notice that at first I don't think but what's alright Samson better late than never right you can always catch up on the recording and thanks for joining even if you know even if it was late that's fine with me a los Anna says 11 p.m. it's in if you don't mind me asking what country are you in I just like to get a feel for like timezone so it was about 4 o'clock here and about 11 p.m. where you were I said I haven't done this for a long time but earlier on when I first started doing the videos I always had everyone shout out where they were from at the beginning and it was always cool to see where everyone was from around the world so we we definitely have I mean we started out with like a hundred years and now we're down to 34 so won't have quite as many but if you're still listening and able to it would be cool to say where you're from and I could just read out really quickly where everyone's from I'll have to remember to say that at the beginning when we have a lot of viewers for the next one because that was always really fun and sometimes people who are maybe too nervous to ask a question or give a comment about code are cool with shouting out where they live because you know it's a much much less pressure on them so it's kind of cool because you know more people join in the chat right away vipul said hi hey thanks for joining on vipul also says what is react and what is the difference between react and are so reactive javascript framework and i actually L reto there's some good answers in live chat so l BRE so says it's like react versus angular verse with you so like there's a distinction between what react does and what angular does but like for the most part people do compare them so reacts if you know about angular or about view you can pretty much think of react in a similar way I know people say that like angular handles the entire like MVC if you're doing an MVC like style project and angular is just the V in MVC or MV star is what people say sometimes but aside from that usually people do use one or the other angular will react XANA says tried to learn angular in 2016 but I didn't have solid no js' knowledge at the time and didn't understand much but now I can say it's something I could grasp quite easily but I'm sure react is better actually that's like the same experience that I had so I think it was I think it was maybe for me like 2015 yeah I mean it was like 20 2015 possibly early 2016 when I tried to do something with angular but I had the same problem I just wasn't good enough with JavaScript and I just couldn't get anything to work in angular so but now I'm sure it would be different and I've heard angular has changed quite a lot since when I worked with it it was angular 1 now I think they're up to 4 and I'm not even sure but yeah so I don't know enough about angular now especially the new versions to really say much about it but I've seen a lot of cool things built with it and I know people that have built that that develop an angular and they're really good good developers way better than me now Bree so says I just learned about Beaumont CSS I've never heard of that is it good as anybody used to okay jack says Evan Peters was on American Horror Story and he was Quicksilver in the Fox xmen movie no way maybe the second firstclass movie oh cool I really like that character I'm gonna have to listen to him now I mean like whenever you hear your own voice like when you're talking it sounds way different than it really sounds to everyone else so I'll have to listen to a recording of my voice and then listen to that guy too but that's cool I'm definitely fine with sounding like him his character and the movie was probably one of my favorite characters so so I think that as a compliment thanks jack alright so you did some people shouting out where they're from bill saying I'm not gonna shout out everybody's names in case you don't want people to know where you're from I'll just say where it is so we have Michigan Texas Chicago London New York another Chicago Serbia Ontario and Delaware and says Delaware don't ask cool so we have definitely like all over the United States and then some foreign countries as well Ireland awesome actually uh we have in my department our head videographer director of videography is is from Canada so I can't remember if he was I'm pretty sure he was from around Ontario as well his family actually still lives up there so he's trying to like work and get money to be able to move him down here so but really good guy very talented with the video work he does Oh Romania okay cool I I just love that there are so many people from all over all over the world always my um the people that are like the head of my department are really in pretty much everybody that's higher up here at the University of our work is pretty much really against remote work because they say like all you need to come in so we can collaborate and I always think it's funny and I usually make comments like I pretty much stay in my office and when I need to talk to my coworkers that you slack and and then I come on here with you all and we basically build websites together I mean so much of the decisions that I make are based on your input and then at times you all even write code and submit pull requests so we work on these sites together and I feel like I collaborate with you all even though you're spread throughout the world then I do with I would say 99% of the people that actually work here on campus so so it's always crazy to me the idea that somehow I have to be physically present on campus to be able to collaborate and that's that's just insane in fact I had I had two meetings today I will actually I had three phone meetings today two of them were phone interviews with people and I didn't even go in they had a conference room set up with a speakerphone and I didn't go in there because for me that would have been harder it would been harder for me to hear I would have had to shout for ever someone to hear me on the speakerphone instead I sit at my computer i dial in through I'm a Google Phi customer so I just dial in through Gmail it's the same headphones I have one now I'm using the same mic that I used to livestream I have my my setup here with my computer's so when I'm talking to a candidate I have their websites up and their resume and I can check out everything it's so much easier for me to interact with people from right here in my office and then the third meeting that I had I was actually driving to go get some food really quickly I decided to go get food 25 minutes for I've stream started so I went to the store this I didn't speed but I like went to the store grab something really fast bought it and came back and I made it back with five minutes to spare I was excited about that but I had a phone call meeting on the way there which was fine which I was totally able to contribute to this meeting while I was walking around in a store so it's just I'm a really big advocate of remote work in case you couldn't tell I think there are definite advantages to it there are advantages to being able to meet facetoface but anymore when you have video chat and I mean soon virtual reality is going to be like high enough quality that it's gonna really mimic you know being next to a person so at that point the advantages of being facetoface are gonna keep going down and down and I guess you're just better off meeting online and not sharing germs at that point anyway sorry for the long the long speech occasionally I go into long talks about my opinion but I actually gain viewers during that old thing so maybe it was good so let me I had a couple more questions while I was talking so I'm going to go through that and then if I don't get any other questions that'll be all for today so Sam says for someone who has primitive knowledge in HTML CSS how long does it take an average person to get to the point where you can apply for jobs I would say apply for jobs at any point first of all so that's not exactly an answer to the question but people need like a varying skill levels so like potentially there are a lot of businesses that think they need a developer but in reality they have like a wordpress site that needs just really basic stuff done they need somebody to like upload blog the wordpress and change images and stuff in that case like you can definitely get that job you can get freelance work with just basic knowledge of HTML and CSS that's how I started out was just getting freelance and subcontracting work and then I just I really worked on my CSS and HTML skills and once I got more comfortable with that I I turned to improving my JavaScript and I started trying to only take jobs where I would learn what I wanted to learn if I could sometimes I just take jobs just for money because I had to pay the bills but you know all my side projects and things would be based around what I wanted to learn the more you know the more jobs you'd be qualified for but I would say like at any point if you find a job that you really want to do apply you know you know be honest about what your skills are but you know you never know and so much of this is just learning what you need to learn to get the job done that I would say there's not really like a standard time period of how long it would take it's just entirely dependent on how much time you have like every day to put into it what the resources that you use how quick of a learner you are there's just too many factors to say for sure but my only advice is just don't feel like you're not good enough to apply for things you know if you if you meet even some of the requirements for a job it's worth it to apply unless the application process is just way too difficult then then forget it but if it's an easy process to apply you may as well do it I mean the worst that could happen is they say no and you just move on I once applied for a job where the minimum requirements were a master's degree and they prefer to doctorate and they wanted like seven years experience doing a job that I never did and hold on one second I I gotta get this okay someone was at my door but anyway so I applied for this job and obviously I didn't get it but I did actually get to like sit face to face with a person that was interviewing with the job it wasn't like really an interview but it was just the person actually gave me a bunch of advice on what I would need to do to get myself ready for a for this job in the future if it ever came open again so it was definitely worth the experience was good and you know it ended up being worth it for me you know I was totally not qualified for it but I got some really good advice from you know from the person that was hiring for the job so you never know dana says do you also review websites and give tips on improvement I mean like not officially but I've had a lot of people since I started livestreaming just send me messages on Twitter and with links to their stuff and yeah I've looked looked at it I've given tips sometimes like people get err errors with things and they don't know what's going on and so I'll actually try to help them with that you know it just depends on how busy I am at the time like if I can get to it it may take me a little while to get to it but like last night I was able to figure out something for someone that watches the stream and it didn't it didn't take me very long I was looking at their code on my phone just like right before I went to bed and I kind of figure it out so I just opened my laptop real quick tested it it worked and just sent a message back and so you know occasionally I'll just get a few minutes here and there and I might be able to help you out so yeah so feel free I mean if I ever get to the point where I'm getting like hundreds of people asking then maybe I'll have to stop but right now like I'm not really a big deal right now I only have like 40 people viewing the stream at this point I'm definitely open to you know helping you individually if you want me to Ken's Ken says me to remote is great today in in office two days in offices enough so when we were talking about remote work yeah I agree I I honestly think like from my job in particular I could definitely do most of my job from home and I could probably be more productive from home there'd be less like interruptions I could see like if they really want me to come in for a meeting or something then I would come in for that but otherwise yeah I think working from home is is great and then from the perspective of the company like if an employee works from home they don't really need an office they maybe just need somewhere to hang out at when they have to come in so you save space or not providing an office then you don't have to worry about providing the air conditioning and the electricity for that office right so you know you can end up saving a lot of money you know for the long term by having most of your workers be remote or at least those who could be remotely remote so um definitely it's a good idea Gina asks what are you using for backend so this the the backend for the site well I guess node it's running on node and then the content management system is WordPress and that's running on that uses PHP and then I mean just to kind of say the entire stack is the site's the WordPress site is PHP and it's running on a with Apache and I believe it's using nginx as a reverse proxy the node installations are I actually have I'm using load balancing between two digitalocean droplets that are both running Express which is with node and they're running react then they are running behind nginx being used as a reverse proxy and then in front of all of that is a digitalocean load balancer so that there's really like never any downtime for the site so that might have been more information than you were looking for but hopefully it answered the the question Umberto's said I'm definitely an advocate of remote work as well I'm the telework coordinator at my workplace but my boss doesn't allow us to telework so frustrating oh wow yeah that's that's Thanks yeah you would think you'd be able to do that from oh well maybe maybe someday and he gets into it Archer Archibald says okay in response to so the question from Sam was about how long does it take an average person to get to the point where you can easily apply for jobs or where you can't apply for jobs and then Archibald says in reply when you can comfortably build something that uses auth user roles databases then I'd say you've got the skills yeah I mean if you get to that point you for sure have the skills I would say you don't even have to get to that point simply because I got a full time job doing web development without even ever doing any of that stuff so it does depend on what you're doing like I mean if you're gonna be a frontend developer you don't even necessarily have to know that much about the other stuff especially if you're gonna get a job at a company where there are other people handling that kind of thing like the databases and things you just have to know how to talk to the databases you know through api's and things but but yeah I mean your goal should be to know how to do that you know off the user role stated if you have all that you'll be people will want you right yeah they'll want you to work for them if you have all those skills bill says even if you get turned down at least you gain some interview experience yeah exactly exactly just the experience of it is it's really important it is it is important having confidence when you interview is a really big deal when I interview somebody and they don't seem really confident it's just like even if I can see their code and see that they can do the job it just really makes me doubtful if they're not confident in their interview and you know there might not be the best judge of things but you know I don't want people to be like overconfident but it's nice you know if you ask someone a question an interview if they can say yeah for sure I can do that or I can learn that you know that's that's important and I think to get to that level of confidence in interviewing it helps that practice Dana says I'm actually looking to hire people skilled in react post post I'm not pissed Postgres QL I never know how to say that but etc where would I go to find qualified independent coders I would like some way to verify their skills before hiring I guess to defend like if you want to employ them directly I'm not exactly sure there there are some places where that will help you find candidates trying to think I just saw a place like that recently where they handle the testing them like doing coding tests but I can't remember what it is I'm sorry if I remember at all I'll try to let you know but I don't remember it but then also like if you wanted to hire developers through like a middleman company their companies like top Tao it's t.o.p tal where you can hire a developer but you know tops how it handles all the contract stuff and payments so it's just I guess it depends on what you would you need okay actually well this is really cool so there are a few people in the live chat that are responding to danishes question about being able to hire people so so that's cool I don't know yeah Danish if you uh if you're on Twitter and you want to tweet you can like mention me and a tweet about wanting to hire people and I'll retweet it for you that might help I mean I have I think I only have like 250 followers or so so it's not like I have a lot but if like I could potentially get retweeted some of the people that follow me have a lot of followers so if I get retweeted it could get out to a lot of people so so I guess let let me know you know send me a tweet if you want me to do that it's it's worth a shot ok bill says that he's seen people use hacker rank as an initial interview process actually that's cool I never thought of using hacker rank that's a good idea Oh Sam asks how does WordPress CMS played with nodejs isn't it a different stack all together as in a lamp stack this is the first time I was watching your livestream I am yet to browse their previous upto uploads yeah that's cool lot I mean honestly it would be a really daunting task for someone to get through all the live streams at this point because they end up there's a lot of them and they're really long so yeah I don't I don't mind I did explain a lot of it before but I don't mind at all giving a little explanation basically the WordPress installation runs on a totally different server so it can have its own stack and then node has its own stack and they don't you know mess with each other I have heard of people I've had people message me on Twitter and telling me that they've gotten it to run on one server together so I'm not exactly sure how to do but it's possible I always just run them on different servers and then it ends up I mean obviously it just works and then you just share data from through the WordPress API is just a REST API so you just make normal API calls from node to WordPress no unbuilt bill basically just said the same thing about the API so thanks Bill okay and Berta said dice comm so that's also another place to find coders so awesome so I've gotten to the end of the live chat and well I just looked at the time it's a long chat all right so probably won't be doing too much on this site before the next for the next show so you won't miss too much we'll probably be right back where we started so anyway have a great weekend and thank you so much for watching and I'll be back I'll be back Monday I should probably check my calendar really quickly just to make sure I will be back Monday it's possible that I might have a meeting or something so I have my calendar up here on another screen so just take me a second okay yeah I'll be back Monday it looks like I have a meeting at 300 p.m. on Monday so it might be a little bit shorter than normal but I should be back at 200 p.m. Eastern Time on Monday so anyway again have a great weekend thank you so much for watching and contributing in the live chat if you're watching this later on and you have questions or anything like don't hesitate ask me on Twitter ask me in the comments I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can and I really appreciate everyone's contributions today you all are really awesome so I'll see you see you next week
