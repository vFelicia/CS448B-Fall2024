00:14 - material design style
00:17 - cards
00:20 - so I have the uh documentation uh from
00:24 - Google for material design here and it's
00:26 - open to the cards page so if you don't
00:28 - know about material design and or you
00:30 - haven't read about cards in particular I
00:33 - recommend you know taking a look it's
00:36 - material.io that's the
00:38 - site so I'm not going to go in depth
00:41 - into a lot of things about why why we
00:43 - use cards hey guys some people are
00:46 - saying hi in the in the live stream
00:48 - thanks thanks for watching uh before I
00:52 - start I want to go over a couple of
00:54 - things at the end of the live stream
00:56 - yesterday I had somebody asked about
00:59 - tips like like money giving money uh I
01:02 - think I did ask for tips but I meant
01:05 - advice so I'm not actually asking for
01:08 - money and just advice so I really

01:43 - something since yesterday's live stream
01:46 - so sorry if I mispronounce any of your
01:48 - names but I want to thank Bill Dyer uh
01:51 - programmer from Texas Tech uh Alan Oscar
01:55 - Diaz and Martin mestrovic so
02:00 - uh they they all provided a lot of good
02:02 - help so thank you I appreciate that a
02:06 - lot and um I've I've checked out all the
02:08 - links and everything you guys sent me so
02:11 - uh I may need to learn a little bit more
02:12 - about it before I implement it but
02:14 - they're all really cool stuff and uh I
02:16 - definitely want to learn more about it
02:19 - also between yesterday's video and the
02:21 - day before we've had over 8,000 views so
02:23 - that's awesome it's like it's just crazy
02:27 - to think about that that many people
02:29 - want to watch to this
02:31 - video also I've put some links in the
02:35 - description so if you want the link to
02:37 - the source code that we're working on
02:39 - it's in the description uh it's a GitHub
02:41 - repo feel free to you know clone that
02:45 - repo you could submit a pool request you
02:48 - know whatever you want the link to the
02:52 - GitHub Pages site where you can actually
02:54 - see what I'm working on see the the site
02:57 - is in there and then a bunch of other
02:58 - links link to my YouTube channel and uh
03:01 - to some of the other things that I'm
03:04 - using uh my code editor the framework
03:07 - I'm using
03:13 - so all right somebody asked again for
03:15 - for tips no I don't I don't want any
03:18 - tips right now I really appreciate that
03:21 - but um I think I I said this yesterday
03:23 - at the end of the video so if you missed
03:25 - it um I'm actually doing these live
03:28 - streams from from work so I'm getting
03:30 - paid right now doing work my boss is
03:33 - awesome and recognizes the value in this
03:35 - sort of thing and so uh he's letting me
03:38 - do this so I don't I don't really feel
03:40 - comfortable getting tips while I'm doing
03:43 - this maybe if I start doing more videos
03:46 - and taking some of my time at home then
03:49 - I'll want tips probably my wife will
03:51 - definitely want me to get tips at that
03:52 - point because she'll have to watch the
03:53 - kids while I do these
03:56 - videos I guess I could take Euros
03:58 - somebody asked about
04:00 - I I don't know I guess it convert it uh
04:04 - but right now I'm not I'm not doing tips
04:06 - I want to be your
04:08 - friend you guys are great in the live
04:10 - stream right now uh I'm going to stop
04:13 - watching the live stream for a little
04:15 - bit so I can get started on this uh in
04:18 - terms of apprentice actually I'm working
04:20 - on getting an internship program started
04:22 - uh where I'm at so I'm in the marketing
04:24 - department at Franciscan University uh I
04:27 - do also do work on the side uh um I I
04:31 - kind of have a company Jesse Wile
04:33 - digital marketing that I haven't really
04:35 - been doing any advertising for for a
04:36 - while but I do some work on the side
04:39 - through them so I guess if anybody's
04:41 - really interested in doing some work
04:43 - with me or uh let me know in the
04:47 - comments or you know send me a direct
04:50 - message on Twitter or
04:53 - something okay so like I said we're
04:56 - going to work on material design cards
04:58 - just basic overview and in case you're
05:00 - not familiar with
05:02 - cards um they have a certain uh box
05:06 - Shadow so it looks like they're lifted
05:08 - off the page and they're a container for
05:09 - content and they help to separate one
05:11 - piece of content from another if you've
05:14 - ever used any Google apps on
05:17 - Android then you've seen cards and
05:19 - they're not just from Google Apps a lot
05:21 - of different sites are adopting this um
05:24 - a lot of apps on Android even though
05:25 - it's not made by Google adopt this and
05:27 - then a lot of websites too I use the
05:30 - materialized framework and that it's
05:34 - basically like bootstrap or Foundation
05:36 - except it uses material design
05:39 - principles all right we got greetings
05:41 - from the
05:42 - Philippines hey uh that's awesome you're
05:46 - watching from the Philippines what time
05:48 - is it
05:55 - there me let me show you an example okay
05:59 - so instead of be talking about a card
06:00 - not showing you this is a card this is
06:02 - Google's first example of a card so if
06:05 - you weren't sure what I was talking
06:06 - about maybe you you've seen this right
06:10 - all right so enough about
06:12 - that let me show you what we're going to
06:14 - be working on so this is what I need to
06:16 - turn into a
06:19 - card this is the old site that I'm
06:22 - working off of um that's semifinished
06:25 - and we're turning it into a different
06:28 - site so
06:30 - in the in the context of this work we're
06:32 - going to go over some basics of material
06:35 - design cars so this is an example of a
06:38 - card we already did this is just a full
06:41 - image when you click it it actually
06:43 - allows you to put in some more info so
06:46 - that's a a decent example of a card the
06:49 - first card we're going to do I'm going
06:50 - to try to get through as many types of
06:52 - cards as I can in this um 206 a.m in the
06:57 - Philippines awesome wow thanks for
06:59 - watching uh so
07:01 - late um I'm going to try to get through
07:04 - as many different types of cards as I
07:05 - can just to show you um kind of how I do
07:08 - cards and all my cards are really based
07:11 - off of what the materialized framework
07:13 - provides at first and then I just modify
07:15 - it to meet uh my
07:17 - needs okay so the first thing we're
07:19 - going to do this section here has logos
07:23 - you can see some of them are on a white
07:24 - background some of them are just on this
07:26 - cream colored background they're not
07:27 - really uniform in size so they're kind
07:29 - of mixed up not really a clean look it's
07:31 - not the look we're going for So the plan
07:33 - is take each one of these put them in a
07:37 - square card with a white background so
07:40 - you know some of these already have the
07:42 - white
07:43 - backgrounds so we're just going to make
07:45 - them all have white so that they're
07:47 - uniform and they're going to have the
07:49 - same type of Shadow like these ones have
07:52 - when you hover over them they're going
07:54 - to pop out a little bit that's kind of a
07:56 - visual cue that hey this is clickable
07:58 - also they'll have the little change in
07:59 - the cursor and uh we're just going to
08:02 - put them I don't know maybe four across
08:06 - there might be an odd one out there
08:07 - we'll see uh and they're all going to
08:10 - link to these different
08:13 - websites all right so let's get started
08:15 - and build one of these cards let me move
08:17 - this off the screen make some
08:20 - room uh let's see I'll move this off for
08:24 - now
08:25 - so I'm sure you guys all do this too but
08:29 - I rarely ever write code from scratch
08:31 - anymore right you just always borrow
08:32 - stuff from your old work uh or from from
08:35 - other people's stuff so the first thing
08:37 - I'm going to do is find that section
08:38 - where we had these
08:41 - cards um on the home this is the oh I'm
08:45 - on the wrong page sorry this the index
08:46 - page since yesterday I did do some stuff
08:49 - I guess I should update you so it's not
08:51 - a surprise um I did I made pages for all
08:54 - the different pages in the site they're
08:56 - basically just copies with not a lot of
08:57 - stuff in them uh I removed the Parallax
09:00 - effect from the header I had a meeting
09:02 - today with some of the people that I'm
09:04 - I'm building the site for and uh it went
09:06 - really well I got a lot of good
09:08 - information but one of the things that
09:10 - they uh did not want was The Parallax
09:14 - effect so um basically The Parallax
09:18 - effect made it seem like this was in the
09:20 - background and it was being covered over
09:22 - by the rest of the site so this this is
09:24 - like a religious institution this this
09:27 - monstr is very sacred for uh Catholics
09:30 - so they didn't want that appearance that
09:32 - it was being covered over but we did
09:34 - incorporate Parallax down below so they
09:36 - had
09:37 - this uh this cross uh this it's called a
09:40 - sandano cross or crucifix they had this
09:44 - actually over top of these images but I
09:46 - think it was cluttered so he moved it
09:48 - here I don't remember if I had this
09:50 - finished for yesterday's video I moved
09:52 - it here and had a parallax effect and
09:53 - it's a nice kind of like reveal uh
09:56 - effect so that's that's a lot of what
10:00 - what I did a lot of kind of minor things
10:03 - and time spent in meetings so not not a
10:05 - whole lot of changes
10:08 - so let me uh regards from Everest all
10:12 - right hi from the Caribbean
10:15 - awesome how's the weather in the
10:17 - Caribbean I bet it's it's nice it's
10:19 - really rainy and kind of a little bit
10:21 - cold here maybe 60° and and rain all
10:27 - day by I'm I'm in Ohio
10:31 - so uh I'm I'm I'm actually really close
10:34 - to Pittsburgh Pennsylvania if anybody
10:36 - knows where that that's at um but I'm in
10:39 - a little a little city in the on the
10:42 - Eastern side of
10:44 - Ohio all right let me find
10:48 - this that I was trying to do a couple
10:50 - minutes
10:53 - ago here we go okay so we have these
10:58 - cards I'm just going to copy this
11:00 - because the card we're going to make is
11:01 - going to be similar so let's go ahead
11:04 - and just copy this whole
11:09 - section
11:11 - uh yeah let's copy this whole thing uh I
11:15 - want to see where this actually ends
11:24 - okay copy in the section and now let's
11:26 - go over to the about page so we did have
11:29 - this page was called um our mission
11:32 - we're changing changing it to the about
11:34 - page because it not only has information
11:37 - about the mission but it also has some
11:39 - pictures of the people uh a few three of
11:42 - the people in charge and it has those
11:46 - different uh organizations that are
11:49 - collaborators that I just showed you a
11:50 - minute ago so discuss it at the meeting
11:53 - this morning and we thought well maybe
11:56 - about would be a better term for that
11:58 - since the page does a lot more than just
12:00 - say the mission and we already have the
12:01 - mission statement on the homepage
12:04 - anyway
12:05 - so let's find the about page and let's
12:08 - go I have some sections already here
12:12 - that I just copied over so let's see
12:15 - this is a white background section this
12:17 - will
12:17 - work and we'll just copy in what we had
12:24 - here and let me show you some of the the
12:27 - markup so you can see it
12:29 - some of it might be a little weird
12:31 - because i' I've added things in so let's
12:33 - cut it down here um I what I don't want
12:37 - is this card reveal so let's let's get
12:40 - rid of some stuff first just to simplify
12:43 - things and oops I don't need this class
12:51 - activator or this class if you're
12:54 - interested in any of the stuff that I've
12:55 - done so far uh if you look at the commit
12:58 - history and the repo you'll be able to
13:00 - see everything that gets done between
13:02 - videos so you won't miss anything I try
13:04 - to be as descriptive as I can in my uh
13:07 - commits hey we got somebody from
13:08 - Pittsburgh all right um I I'm actually
13:12 - grew up in Weirton uh I don't know if
13:14 - you know where that is uh the uh the M
13:17 - Herman from Pittsburgh so it's it's
13:20 - actually the city in West Virginia
13:22 - that's really North fit borders
13:23 - Pennsylvania and Ohio so I'm about a
13:28 - half hour drive from Pittsburgh I can
13:31 - actually get to the um the west side of
13:35 - Pittsburgh in about 20 25 minutes so
13:38 - awesome it's so cool have people from so
13:41 - many different places so that's that's
13:44 - awesome to see I actually I know I'm
13:46 - missing a lot of stuff I'm sure in the
13:47 - live chat I do go back afterwards and I
13:49 - read everything in the live chat so I
13:52 - will see what you said I might not see
13:54 - it until later if you really if you have
13:56 - a question though put it in the comments
13:57 - so that I can reply to it later on uh if
14:00 - I don't see it in the live
14:02 - chat okay so basically I just removed
14:04 - that little part that was the um the
14:06 - part that got
14:08 - revealed I'll bring it back in to show
14:11 - you so I had this this reveal I remove
14:14 - that part because we're not going to use
14:16 - it for this next set of
14:22 - cards all right we clean it up a little
14:25 - bit we still want it to be hoverable
14:28 - we're still giving this card the style
14:30 - of cursor pointer normally you know you
14:32 - don't really want to put style tags
14:34 - right in here uh in this case it's just
14:37 - easier to um to show you what to do uh
14:42 - also eventually all this I'm going to
14:44 - convert it to react components and I
14:47 - am not really against putting style tags
14:50 - directly into react
14:53 - components I'll probably do a better way
14:55 - than that though but at first this will
14:57 - make it easier to transition over
15:00 - okay so the only other thing we have
15:02 - going on here is we we have this in a
15:03 - row we have it in columns that's just
15:05 - Mater the column classes uh for
15:08 - materialize all we're really worried
15:09 - about here let me separate it out so we
15:11 - can see I I'll put some spaces in um the
15:15 - actual part that's the card is just this
15:18 - stuff here so we just have two
15:22 - divs and a span in there uh for for a
15:26 - title we're actually going to take this
15:27 - out because we don't even want a title
15:28 - this is just a straight image card uh
15:31 - that we're going to do and uh this is
15:35 - such a basic example it's probably in
15:37 - the materialized documentation as well
15:39 - and you could just copy and paste from
15:40 - there the only other weird thing we have
15:42 - going on is we're using Source set to do
15:44 - some responsive images I went over this
15:47 - in a previous video that I did on my
15:49 - channel so uh if you can check that out
15:51 - I'll go in more depth I think I'm going
15:53 - to do maybe a pre-recorded video on this
15:56 - at some point uh so you don't have to
15:58 - sift through a whole half hour live
16:00 - stream to find when I went over this but
16:03 - basically all we're doing here is just
16:04 - putting in a different image depending
16:06 - on screen width and
16:10 - resolution but in this case let's switch
16:13 - out I did copy over some of those logos
16:15 - so let's check out our image folder and
16:17 - let's take I'm going to take a logo that
16:19 - has a short name all right osv
16:21 - logo so I'm going to switch this out
16:24 - to what was that do osv logo
16:34 - PN and at this point none of these are
16:37 - really optimized they haven't been
16:39 - compressed or anything uh we're just
16:41 - kind of seeing how it how it all goes
16:44 - let me go to that page so we can see
16:48 - that's the about page now I'll bring it
16:50 - over on the other screen so everybody
16:51 - can see
16:53 - it okay somebody's asking about react I
16:55 - know I've been talking about react every
16:57 - video I was just thinking about that
16:59 - earlier we are definitely going to do
17:02 - react but it's probably going to be next
17:03 - week there's a possibility if I can't
17:07 - get if I don't think I can get it ready
17:09 - by launch which needs to be some point
17:11 - next week uh there may be some delay at
17:14 - the printer for some other marketing for
17:16 - this site so we may get an extension on
17:19 - the date when this has to go live but
17:20 - I'm assuming it has to be live by the
17:22 - 13th of this month if I can't get it
17:25 - converted over to react in that amount
17:26 - of time I'm just going to put up like
17:28 - the static site that's why we're doing
17:30 - the static site
17:32 - first if that's the case then it's
17:34 - possible I won't get to react till the
17:36 - week after that but I definitely will
17:38 - I'm looking forward to it as well I I
17:40 - haven't worked with it in a couple weeks
17:42 - and I I really miss it um I don't know
17:45 - if anybody has worked with react but
17:46 - it's it's for me at least it was kind of
17:48 - hard to wrap my mind around at first but
17:50 - then once I really got into it I it it
17:53 - was cool I I liked it it was fun to work
17:55 - with and uh I kind of like don't want to
17:57 - go back to anything else after that but
18:00 - you got to use sometimes it's it's
18:02 - Overkill to use your act sometimes when
18:04 - you don't have
18:05 - to
18:07 - um oh Zimbabwe awesome we got a viewers
18:11 - some from uh Zimbabwe okay so you can
18:14 - see basically what happened this is the
18:16 - card and
18:19 - we we don't have that
18:22 - um that um if
18:25 - you I forgot to put it on this screen
18:27 - sorry guys okay so now you can see what
18:29 - happened we put that logo in there um we
18:32 - uh I'm clicking it right now and that
18:35 - effect's not happening because we took
18:36 - all that out the only thing we want to
18:38 - add though is we want to add a link so
18:43 - let's pop in an a tag and so this is I
18:46 - don't prepare this stuff ahead of time
18:48 - we're just doing it on the go so uh just
18:51 - just so you know uh I'm trying things
18:54 - out sometimes they don't always work so
18:56 - I don't remember exactly how I usually
18:58 - do this with the a tag so let's just
19:02 - put should I put it here or should I
19:05 - make the image I
19:07 - think the best thing is going to be to
19:09 - wrap this image in the a
19:12 - tag yeah I think that's how I usually do
19:16 - it uh for now I don't remember what this
19:20 - address is for this site so I'm just
19:21 - going to put a hash in there as a
19:23 - placeholder uh whenever you're doing a
19:27 - link uh always put the title
19:34 - in because uh for like screen readers
19:38 - for people uh who have you know Vision
19:40 - impairment and things uh you want that
19:42 - title in also if somebody that covers
19:45 - over the link it'll pop up uh so always
19:48 - keep that in mind that people um have
19:51 - different needs uh for when they're
19:53 - viewing a website so uh it just it only
19:56 - takes an extra second but it could
19:58 - really mean a lot to somebody who's
19:59 - trying to view your
20:01 - site also I like to
20:04 - use uh Target blank if somebody's
20:06 - leaving the site I don't always use this
20:09 - sometimes it can be annoying to people
20:11 - uh it just depends on the context but in
20:13 - this case
20:16 - well sorry about that I just scrolled
20:19 - over I hope nobody's motion sick because
20:21 - I'm kind of move the windows around a
20:23 - lot I know I get motion sick really
20:26 - easily so espe especially like all the
20:29 - new virtual reality stuff I just can't I
20:32 - can't handle most of it so I apologize
20:36 - if all my moving around of these windows
20:38 - is making anybody
20:41 - sick okay so I just saved that it auto
20:44 - refreshes I'm using gulp uh to um live
20:47 - reload this okay so we can see as I
20:50 - hover over that it's going to be really
20:52 - tiny on your screen but maybe you can
20:54 - make out down in the bottom left corner
20:58 - it has it's showing me that there's a
21:00 - URL uh when I hover over this so that's
21:04 - a link so this entire card now is a link
21:07 - it has this cool hover effect it also
21:09 - has a did we put a an click
21:14 - effect no we didn't with materialize
21:17 - there's the option to have like some
21:19 - click effects so when you click on
21:20 - something you get like some waves let's
21:22 - see if it's the one it here there we go
21:24 - it was hard it's hard to see there I
21:27 - don't know if you can see it I'm going
21:27 - to do it one more time
21:29 - it has like this wave that's just
21:31 - emanating from the point where you you
21:33 - click so why2 D somebody asked why two
21:38 - divs for this card why not add class
21:40 - card image within the first div okay so
21:45 - part of the reason why I use this
21:46 - structure well really the entire reason
21:48 - why I use this structure is uh since I'm
21:50 - using a framework materialize I'm I use
21:52 - the structure that that they uh that
21:56 - they recommend in their documentation
21:59 - so in their documentation you do have it
22:02 - if I were making this card
22:04 - myself you're right it it would be so
22:07 - much more simple to just do one div
22:12 - there have been there are some occasions
22:13 - when I do have the cards just I make
22:16 - them
22:17 - myself usually when I want to make sure
22:19 - that cards are all exactly the same
22:22 - height um I use it's easier for me to do
22:26 - that if I have just the card be one
22:29 - if so i' I have done that on occasion
22:32 - but in this case this is just the markup
22:36 - that is required for the
22:39 - framework but in general it is I I like
22:42 - to use less markup if possible uh we had
22:45 - somebody says hi from uh Iraq so uh
22:52 - awesome that's just I I can't believe uh
22:55 - you know we're covering like all parts
22:57 - of the world here so
22:59 - that's great also why do You tab over
23:01 - the image ele why not keep the A and
23:03 - image element the same tab level yeah
23:05 - that's a good point the only reason I
23:07 - did it like this is because this image
23:09 - is uh sorry I let me read that question
23:11 - out loud somebody asked why did I I
23:15 - separate this a element and the image
23:17 - element why not just leave it on one
23:18 - line if they were smaller I would
23:21 - definitely leave it on one line but
23:22 - since I have so much here and I already
23:24 - can't even see the end of it uh I just I
23:27 - put them out on different lines so that
23:29 - I can because usually when I'm editing
23:31 - it's it looks more like
23:33 - this uh so I can see the CSS or the
23:36 - JavaScript and the HTML at the same time
23:41 - so if it's going to be really long I'd
23:43 - rather see it but yeah in general you
23:47 - can really you can just put the image
23:48 - tag and and the a tag on the same line
23:51 - uh that comes from style it depends on
23:53 - what you're doing if you work somewhere
23:54 - where there's like a you know a style
23:57 - for coding like that's strictly enforced
23:59 - you got to go with that I don't have
24:01 - that where I'm at at least not yet I'd
24:04 - like to develop it for when we start
24:06 - getting you know some interns or student
24:08 - workers or things but um for now I can
24:12 - kind of do what I want so I I try to be
24:15 - cons as consistent as I can be uh but
24:18 - occasionally I'm not sometimes you're
24:20 - just in a hurry and uh you forget how to
24:22 - do things all right so the only other
24:26 - thing that I'd want to do with this card
24:29 - is I definitely don't want it this big
24:31 - I'd shrink it down I'm going to try to
24:32 - fit maybe four cards on a line but I
24:35 - want to jump over to something a little
24:36 - bit more complex this is a really simple
24:38 - example and uh if you didn't follow it
24:41 - all just check out the uh the the source
24:44 - code on GitHub I'm going to commit all
24:47 - the stuff from from this live stream as
24:51 - quick as I can after this live stream
24:54 - and then also I'll I'll I'll be working
24:56 - on all the things I'm saying that I'm
24:57 - going to do uh today so hopefully it'll
25:00 - be all be done by the end of the day
25:01 - today so we don't have a lot of time
25:03 - left so let's try to get started on this
25:05 - other card as soon as possible I'm going
25:07 - to flip over I use Trello for my kind of
25:10 - personal project management here uh so
25:14 - we wanted to make cards for
25:15 - collaborators that's just what we did oh
25:17 - I almost forgot I need your
25:19 - help uh we need based on feedback from
25:23 - the meeting this morning uh did a little
25:25 - demo we need a different font for the
25:27 - headers so
25:29 - real quick I want to show you this is
25:31 - the font for the headers that I'm using
25:33 - now it's just it's just robotto so we
25:36 - want a different font and I'll show you
25:37 - what the font is used on the other the
25:39 - old site this is the font that's used
25:41 - it's um EB
25:44 - gamon
25:46 - so I
25:48 - have two fonts that I'm thinking about
25:52 - using me switch so this is the E garamon
25:55 - this is what's being used right now
25:58 - and this is a font I found what is it
26:02 - called
26:04 - sinel okay I kind of really like this
26:08 - bottom font the the thin version of it
26:10 - really struck me that I liked it and I
26:12 - thought it might work for this site but
26:15 - I know um I already know this font would
26:17 - work because this font was already
26:18 - chosen by the people who are in charge
26:21 - of uh of this department that I'm doing
26:22 - the site for but um if I can find a font
26:26 - that's even better I can show them and
26:28 - you know maybe they'll they'll prefer
26:30 - that
26:31 - so I mean I already told you my
26:34 - preference let me know because it's not
26:38 - it's not always about what I think looks
26:40 - good uh I love to get second opinion so
26:43 - let me know in the comments if you can
26:45 - which font you prefer the one on the top
26:47 - is EB gamond the one on the bottom is
26:50 - sinzo you can find those both on Google
26:53 - fonts if you want to take a look at them
26:56 - in more depth or if you have another
26:57 - font F that looks similar to these fonts
27:00 - that you think would be even better let
27:02 - me know at this point I can I can hold
27:05 - off a little while longer before
27:07 - changing the font on these headers so
27:09 - I'm I'm open to
27:11 - suggestions okay we got three minutes
27:14 - let's let's get something done in three
27:16 - minutes okay so the next thing that
27:18 - we're going to do is what's cards for
27:22 - resources okay let's switch this
27:25 - over and let me show you the resources
27:28 - page
27:31 - quickly it probably doesn't matter
27:33 - there's really nothing on the resource
27:35 - page right now but I I'll show you
27:36 - anyway this is the resource page on the
27:38 - old site basically there's going to be
27:40 - two categories there's going to be free
27:42 - resources and resources that you have to
27:44 - pay for so the trick is we need to come
27:48 - up with a
27:49 - card that is going to be able to work
27:52 - for any data type so these resources are
27:55 - going to end up being
27:58 - they could be links to uh text
28:03 - articles okay the um the menu links only
28:07 - work on the homepage for right now since
28:09 - this will probably get changed into
28:12 - react I don't really see the point in
28:14 - building everything out on every page
28:16 - the homepage will be the most complete
28:18 - and then you know the the this nav will
28:21 - be its own component that would just get
28:23 - reused everywhere uh if we end up not
28:26 - having time for that then you know we'll
28:29 - just uh hurry up and copy and paste it
28:32 - all
28:33 - over okay I don't know why I just needed
28:35 - to click on that because it still has
28:37 - all this basic stuff that I copied to
28:39 - all the
28:41 - pages but uh okay it looks like some
28:44 - people oh man we we got people for both
28:46 - both fonts so ah this might be tough we
28:50 - might have a tie here and I'm just going
28:52 - to have to decide anyway um if we do
28:54 - have a tie I don't I don't know what
28:56 - I'll do maybe I'll um I'll use both
28:58 - fonts on different pages and then see
29:00 - what uh see what everybody likes that's
29:03 - actually in charge of this department
29:05 - and see what they think uh but basically
29:09 - we need a card that's going to be able
29:10 - to have to display uh video EDS from
29:13 - YouTube text probably a link to a text
29:17 - article uh
29:19 - images if we have a good image to put
29:21 - with it um or audio so it's going to
29:24 - need like a title space for an image
29:26 - space for title
29:28 - probably a button somewhere uh for a
29:32 - link and you can see here's what you
29:35 - don't really put buttons on cards Google
29:37 - puts you know we have these little
29:39 - things so so you don't you don't put
29:41 - like a raise button on a card in
29:43 - material design uh you can potentially
29:46 - put I I've seen it done where you put
29:48 - like a little round uh action button
29:51 - somewhere here on a card but I don't
29:53 - think we'll need that I don't think
29:54 - that'll be necessary so um
29:58 - I'm thinking a card like this would work
30:01 - we could have an optional image that
30:04 - would maybe uh maybe be there maybe not
30:07 - depending on whether one gets
30:10 - uploaded this works it has a title yeah
30:12 - we definitely need a short description
30:14 - so people know what what it is
30:19 - and I wonder if it would be worth it to
30:22 - differentiate between cards somehow so
30:24 - that people know right away whether this
30:26 - is a paid resource or free resource I
30:29 - don't know what the best way would be
30:31 - I'm thinking maybe I I don't want to do
30:33 - a completely different
30:35 - color but maybe some sort of indication
30:39 - somewhere in the card so that they can
30:42 - know at a glance I have to think about
30:43 - that
30:45 - maybe maybe an icon from I guess the the
30:49 - marketer in me is thinking uh don't
30:52 - don't Mark the paid ones instead Mark
30:56 - the free ones as free and then people
30:58 - will think hey this is awesome it's free
31:01 - but if they see the paid thing they'll
31:03 - say oh that stinks I have to pay for it
31:05 - so that's just me thinking it's it's
31:08 - more positive to see a label that says
31:11 - free than a label that says you got to
31:13 - pay for
31:14 - this uh I don't know at least that's
31:16 - what I a small key icon would work okay
31:19 - a small key icon yeah that's that's cool
31:21 - actually that's a good idea I should
31:23 - just look through some
31:24 - icons and see uh if there's an icon that
31:28 - would work yeah that yeah a little icon
31:30 - that would either maybe go at the end of
31:32 - the
31:33 - title um I was actually thinking like
31:35 - you know kind of a little Banner right
31:37 - here but I think the key would be easier
31:39 - to implement and would would look nice
31:42 - great that's a great idea thank you uh
31:44 - Claude B for that
31:47 - idea all right I know I gotta be running
31:49 - yeah I'm already over on time so sorry
31:51 - about that I really wanted to actually
31:52 - start to build this card out but um I
31:55 - got got sidetracked with a pH fonts but
31:58 - I really do want your help with deciding
32:00 - on the fonts uh cuz I could spend
32:02 - forever looking at fonts and I don't
32:04 - have that time right now so thanks for
32:08 - watching uh thank you for everybody
32:10 - being so awesome in the the live uh chat
32:14 - and for interacting with me and giving
32:16 - me great ideas uh also it's really cool
32:18 - you guys uh kind of shouted out where
32:20 - you were from uh I really like that that
32:22 - was fun so I will be back well today's
32:26 - Friday so have a great week
32:28 - um I will live stream again on Monday 2
32:32 - p.m Eastern Time same time
32:36 - and I maybe I'll save I don't have to
32:39 - work on these cards I have a lot of
32:40 - other stuff on the site that I could
32:41 - work on that maybe isn't as exciting so
32:44 - probably on Monday we can work on cards
32:47 - or if I find something else that I think
32:48 - will be um interesting maybe we'll do
32:51 - that uh if you have any topics that you
32:54 - really want me to talk about let me know
32:56 - if it's something that I'm going to
32:57 - going to do for the site I can work it
33:00 - in ending yeah the stream's ending I
33:03 - just streamed for a half an hour I don't
33:05 - I I don't want to put people through a
33:06 - super long video when they go to watch
33:08 - the recording so I just do a half hour
33:11 - uh and also I I work a lot slower when I
33:13 - have to narrate so if I did this all day
33:17 - I'd get way less work done uh that task
33:20 - manager I was using is Trello uh I'll
33:23 - write that down I I'll put a link to it
33:25 - in the
33:26 - description it's a free uh thing and um
33:31 - it just lets me do that actually GitHub
33:33 - added something similar to that so
33:35 - there's a feature on GitHub that does
33:37 - that as well I haven't had time to use
33:39 - it yet I may switch to that some point
33:41 - since I'm already using GitHub but for
33:43 - right now i' I'm I'm used to Trello so
33:47 - um maybe I'll do a video on how I I
33:49 - manage uh my stuff a short video on at
33:52 - some point if you guys if you guys want
33:54 - that let me know uh it's trell useful
33:56 - for solo project
33:58 - um yeah sorry if I don't want this video
34:01 - to go too long but uh you still have
34:03 - questions I'll answer questions for a
34:05 - couple more minutes um let's see is
34:07 - Trello useful for your work solo
34:08 - projects yes Trello is definitely useful
34:10 - for solo projects um I'll just show you
34:13 - quickly let me move this off the
34:16 - screen like I said I'd like to maybe do
34:19 - a a video on this but just really
34:21 - quickly to show you uh let me see if I
34:23 - can make this bigger so you can see see
34:26 - the font okay okay
34:28 - so I um I have it separated into these
34:33 - lists so in Trello everything's in a
34:35 - list and then cards so I have to-do
34:38 - ready for development in progress
34:40 - testing and done every task is broken up
34:44 - into these these lists into these cards
34:46 - and so I can open it up I can put this
34:49 - was the font task so I had the links to
34:51 - those fonts I showed you in here you can
34:54 - attach files and pictures and things if
34:57 - I was working in a
34:58 - team I could assign a task to
35:02 - somebody and they'd be able to see it
35:04 - too and you could you know share share
35:06 - your boards with with your team or
35:07 - whoever you need to you could even share
35:09 - it with your clients uh if you wanted
35:11 - them to see the progress and have them
35:13 - uh you know you could maybe put a
35:15 - screenshot in or something and ask their
35:16 - opinion on some something or have them
35:18 - add things so it's really cool uh like I
35:21 - say even if it's
35:23 - solo uh I I use it pretty much solo all
35:26 - the time in my department we have a
35:28 - different project management system that
35:30 - we use for the whole department it's
35:31 - called Reich uh
35:34 - so I I update tasks in there but no one
35:37 - else in my department really cares or
35:39 - needs to know all the little tasks so
35:41 - for that I use this because it's just so
35:44 - fast I also have these little numbers
35:46 - here uh these are Pomodoro Cycles so um
35:51 - every 25 minutes I take a little break I
35:54 - have a timer for that so I estimate how
35:57 - many 25 minute
35:59 - periods each of these tasks will take so
36:02 - for right now to create the cards for
36:04 - the resources which we were just talking
36:06 - about I estimate that it would take me
36:08 - three 25 minute periods when I'm
36:12 - done I put so let me show you when
36:14 - that's done when I'm done at the end I
36:17 - put how long it actually took so I want
36:20 - to change the the mission page to the
36:23 - about page I estimated it would take an
36:24 - entire 25 minute period which is crazy I
36:27 - I don't know why I said it would take
36:28 - that long it only took me half of that
36:31 - time probably less than half of it so
36:33 - now I can go back and
36:35 - see what I estimated you know for this
36:38 - everything that's done I've estimated
36:40 - 7.5 cycles and it's only taken me six so
36:44 - it gives me a good idea the more I do
36:46 - this the closer I get so um I'm able
36:51 - when somebody comes to me like you know
36:53 - when my boss or the head of my
36:55 - department comes in and says how long is
36:56 - it going to be I can look look at all
36:57 - these to-dos and how much I have left
37:00 - and I say okay I have 397 so I can add
37:03 - this section up and I know about how
37:06 - long it's going to take me before the
37:07 - site is
37:09 - finished and um that's really cool
37:11 - there's some other cool charting stuff
37:13 - you can do with this I don't really use
37:15 - that a lot uh I imagine it would be more
37:17 - helpful maybe if you were on a team uh
37:20 - but this is really helped me to get my
37:22 - estimates you know kind of On Target
37:25 - that was always the hardest thing for me
37:26 - especially when I was like
37:29 - freelancing uh you know when all my my
37:32 - work was freelance work it was really
37:34 - hard for me to try to get a handle on
37:36 - you know how how long is the project
37:38 - going to take uh but this kind of forces
37:40 - me to estimate every little thing and
37:42 - it's so much easier to estimate a small
37:44 - task than to try to estimate a big task
37:46 - so if you break it down estimate each
37:48 - one individually and then add it all up
37:50 - you'll be so much closer to an accurate
37:53 - uh an accurate
37:56 - number calculate buing okay Claud B
37:59 - asked do you use that to calculate your
38:01 - hours or bilding or to get better at
38:02 - estimating yeah okay so pretty much
38:04 - everything um all of the above uh it it
38:08 - does it does work well actually if I'm
38:11 - calculating my hours um this video is
38:14 - going to be a little longer so I I guess
38:17 - that's cool
38:19 - uh let's see do you think it's possible
38:21 - for 15-year-old to make it in web design
38:23 - freelancing oh yeah I think a
38:25 - 15-year-old could definitely get get
38:28 - work um uh a guy that I used to work
38:31 - with a lot and he actually got me I
38:34 - wasn't doing web design for a lot I had
38:35 - got into it a little bit uh when I was
38:37 - in high school and done a little bit of
38:39 - work and uh then I got away from it I
38:42 - was actually teaching high school and
38:44 - then I I quit teaching I did some stuff
38:46 - in the stock market for a little bit and
38:48 - then this guy was in um this guy I went
38:52 - to high school with was doing web design
38:53 - stuff and he needed somebody to work
38:55 - with so he got got me back into it and
38:58 - he was awesome awesome mentor and uh got
39:01 - me introduced to a lot of good clients
39:03 - and a lot of experience but he actually
39:06 - started when he was really young he's a
39:08 - couple years younger than me so he was
39:10 - maybe 15 when he got started and he was
39:13 - doing work for he he has an uncle that
39:16 - has a marketing company and he was doing
39:18 - work for his uncle as a teenager and
39:21 - making making money so definitely just
39:24 - uh try to be as professional as you can
39:26 - be and um you know it's it can't hurt to
39:30 - to ask to propose things you know uh go
39:33 - around you know just you go around a
39:35 - local places uh I I don't recommend
39:37 - going on like kind of the freelancing
39:39 - job boards to be honest with you I
39:41 - haven't had much success with
39:43 - that uh
39:45 - usually you don't really make a lot of
39:47 - money uh people are out bidding a lot so
39:52 - uh I I kind of think it's better to
39:54 - just um
39:57 - go out and try to get contacts like
40:00 - actual personal contacts either through
40:02 - the internet by talking to people on you
40:04 - know social media and forms and things
40:06 - or in in your local
40:08 - community uh that's I've gotten the most
40:11 - clients and the best clients from my
40:13 - connections my personal connections and
40:14 - from referrals from other
40:17 - clients uh I was trying to ask answer
40:19 - somebody else's question oh okay
40:21 - somebody asked me about billing let me
40:24 - show you real quick and this will
40:26 - probably be the last thing I go over uh
40:29 - let me show you how I track my projects
40:31 - so I'm going to bring this
40:33 - over and uh this is going to be small
40:35 - but that's okay because you don't really
40:37 - need to see everything but this this
40:40 - might seem crazy to you but for for the
40:44 - University right now every project that
40:47 - I've been working on has its own tab in
40:49 - this
40:50 - spreadsheet at the bottom here
40:53 - so I put the date the number of hours
40:56 - that I've worked and then a quick
40:58 - summary of what I've done these
41:00 - summaries are basically the same thing I
41:02 - put in my G
41:04 - commits and um I have a total at the
41:07 - bottom now for my job now I don't get
41:09 - paid hourly so this is basically just a
41:13 - way for me to keep track that if I have
41:15 - to go in for a performance review I can
41:18 - say you know this this project brought
41:21 - in you know so much money to the
41:23 - university if you would have had to
41:25 - contract this out to somebody
41:27 - it would have cost you so much money you
41:29 - know if you were CH paying it hourly so
41:32 - that's what this allows me to do it's
41:33 - it's kind of nice to be able to go in
41:35 - and tell my boss like you know hey youve
41:38 - you saved a ton of money by hiring me
41:40 - and having me me do this work uh so
41:44 - that's kind of I was already used to
41:45 - doing this for my clients on the side so
41:47 - I just kept doing it when I started
41:49 - working here about two years ago and uh
41:52 - it still comes in handy for
41:55 - me and uh when I have clients I I
41:58 - actually just use that sorry I flipped
42:00 - over when I have clients next to this
42:03 - number will actually be my how much they
42:06 - they're paying me so if it is an hourly
42:08 - job I'll just multiply this number by
42:10 - what the hourly rate is and right here
42:12 - I'll have the um the amount they owe me
42:15 - usually it's so I have some recurring
42:17 - clients so each of these tabs would then
42:18 - be a month so I would have one spreadsh
42:21 - sheeet per client and then each month
42:23 - they would get build based on the uh the
42:27 - total number here so I hope that's
42:30 - helpful I'm there's probably better ways
42:32 - to do that and I'm sure there are
42:34 - services that can do that but
42:38 - uh we have to be extremely organized
42:41 - yeah
42:43 - uh it is it's good to be organized uh
42:46 - when you do all this stuff I guess you
42:47 - don't have to be it depends on where
42:49 - you're working at but it definitely
42:51 - helps it it for sure helps if you're on
42:53 - your own like it really
42:55 - helps uh if especially if you need to
42:57 - keep track of things for tax purposes uh
43:01 - then the more documentation you have for
43:04 - everything then it's better or if you
43:06 - ever have to if a client doesn't want to
43:08 - pay and starts asking you what did you
43:10 - really do well you have very detailed
43:13 - evidence of everything you've done on
43:14 - that site at that point so I've went
43:17 - over a lot longer than I anticipated and
43:20 - the chat's kind of slowing down so uh
43:23 - I'm going to go but have a great weekend
43:25 - I'll be back on Monday and thanks for
43:33 - watching

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody it's Jesse today we are going to work on material design style cards so I have the uh documentation uh from Google for material design here and it's open to the cards page so if you don't know about material design and or you haven't read about cards in particular I recommend you know taking a look it's material.io that's the site so I'm not going to go in depth into a lot of things about why why we use cards hey guys some people are saying hi in the in the live stream thanks thanks for watching uh before I start I want to go over a couple of things at the end of the live stream yesterday I had somebody asked about tips like like money giving money uh I think I did ask for tips but I meant advice so I'm not actually asking for money and just advice so I really appreciate the uh generosity of people wanting to uh to give tips but for now advice is fine hey I'm doing all right thanks for asking um I also want to thank you guys I had I did get a lot of good advice so I was awesome in particular I want to thank uh four people who either sent me some really good links or even went farther and you taught me how to do something since yesterday's live stream so sorry if I mispronounce any of your names but I want to thank Bill Dyer uh programmer from Texas Tech uh Alan Oscar Diaz and Martin mestrovic so uh they they all provided a lot of good help so thank you I appreciate that a lot and um I've I've checked out all the links and everything you guys sent me so uh I may need to learn a little bit more about it before I implement it but they're all really cool stuff and uh I definitely want to learn more about it also between yesterday's video and the day before we've had over 8,000 views so that's awesome it's like it's just crazy to think about that that many people want to watch to this video also I've put some links in the description so if you want the link to the source code that we're working on it's in the description uh it's a GitHub repo feel free to you know clone that repo you could submit a pool request you know whatever you want the link to the GitHub Pages site where you can actually see what I'm working on see the the site is in there and then a bunch of other links link to my YouTube channel and uh to some of the other things that I'm using uh my code editor the framework I'm using so all right somebody asked again for for tips no I don't I don't want any tips right now I really appreciate that but um I think I I said this yesterday at the end of the video so if you missed it um I'm actually doing these live streams from from work so I'm getting paid right now doing work my boss is awesome and recognizes the value in this sort of thing and so uh he's letting me do this so I don't I don't really feel comfortable getting tips while I'm doing this maybe if I start doing more videos and taking some of my time at home then I'll want tips probably my wife will definitely want me to get tips at that point because she'll have to watch the kids while I do these videos I guess I could take Euros somebody asked about I I don't know I guess it convert it uh but right now I'm not I'm not doing tips I want to be your friend you guys are great in the live stream right now uh I'm going to stop watching the live stream for a little bit so I can get started on this uh in terms of apprentice actually I'm working on getting an internship program started uh where I'm at so I'm in the marketing department at Franciscan University uh I do also do work on the side uh um I I kind of have a company Jesse Wile digital marketing that I haven't really been doing any advertising for for a while but I do some work on the side through them so I guess if anybody's really interested in doing some work with me or uh let me know in the comments or you know send me a direct message on Twitter or something okay so like I said we're going to work on material design cards just basic overview and in case you're not familiar with cards um they have a certain uh box Shadow so it looks like they're lifted off the page and they're a container for content and they help to separate one piece of content from another if you've ever used any Google apps on Android then you've seen cards and they're not just from Google Apps a lot of different sites are adopting this um a lot of apps on Android even though it's not made by Google adopt this and then a lot of websites too I use the materialized framework and that it's basically like bootstrap or Foundation except it uses material design principles all right we got greetings from the Philippines hey uh that's awesome you're watching from the Philippines what time is it there me let me show you an example okay so instead of be talking about a card not showing you this is a card this is Google's first example of a card so if you weren't sure what I was talking about maybe you you've seen this right all right so enough about that let me show you what we're going to be working on so this is what I need to turn into a card this is the old site that I'm working off of um that's semifinished and we're turning it into a different site so in the in the context of this work we're going to go over some basics of material design cars so this is an example of a card we already did this is just a full image when you click it it actually allows you to put in some more info so that's a a decent example of a card the first card we're going to do I'm going to try to get through as many types of cards as I can in this um 206 a.m in the Philippines awesome wow thanks for watching uh so late um I'm going to try to get through as many different types of cards as I can just to show you um kind of how I do cards and all my cards are really based off of what the materialized framework provides at first and then I just modify it to meet uh my needs okay so the first thing we're going to do this section here has logos you can see some of them are on a white background some of them are just on this cream colored background they're not really uniform in size so they're kind of mixed up not really a clean look it's not the look we're going for So the plan is take each one of these put them in a square card with a white background so you know some of these already have the white backgrounds so we're just going to make them all have white so that they're uniform and they're going to have the same type of Shadow like these ones have when you hover over them they're going to pop out a little bit that's kind of a visual cue that hey this is clickable also they'll have the little change in the cursor and uh we're just going to put them I don't know maybe four across there might be an odd one out there we'll see uh and they're all going to link to these different websites all right so let's get started and build one of these cards let me move this off the screen make some room uh let's see I'll move this off for now so I'm sure you guys all do this too but I rarely ever write code from scratch anymore right you just always borrow stuff from your old work uh or from from other people's stuff so the first thing I'm going to do is find that section where we had these cards um on the home this is the oh I'm on the wrong page sorry this the index page since yesterday I did do some stuff I guess I should update you so it's not a surprise um I did I made pages for all the different pages in the site they're basically just copies with not a lot of stuff in them uh I removed the Parallax effect from the header I had a meeting today with some of the people that I'm I'm building the site for and uh it went really well I got a lot of good information but one of the things that they uh did not want was The Parallax effect so um basically The Parallax effect made it seem like this was in the background and it was being covered over by the rest of the site so this this is like a religious institution this this monstr is very sacred for uh Catholics so they didn't want that appearance that it was being covered over but we did incorporate Parallax down below so they had this uh this cross uh this it's called a sandano cross or crucifix they had this actually over top of these images but I think it was cluttered so he moved it here I don't remember if I had this finished for yesterday's video I moved it here and had a parallax effect and it's a nice kind of like reveal uh effect so that's that's a lot of what what I did a lot of kind of minor things and time spent in meetings so not not a whole lot of changes so let me uh regards from Everest all right hi from the Caribbean awesome how's the weather in the Caribbean I bet it's it's nice it's really rainy and kind of a little bit cold here maybe 60° and and rain all day by I'm I'm in Ohio so uh I'm I'm I'm actually really close to Pittsburgh Pennsylvania if anybody knows where that that's at um but I'm in a little a little city in the on the Eastern side of Ohio all right let me find this that I was trying to do a couple minutes ago here we go okay so we have these cards I'm just going to copy this because the card we're going to make is going to be similar so let's go ahead and just copy this whole section uh yeah let's copy this whole thing uh I want to see where this actually ends okay copy in the section and now let's go over to the about page so we did have this page was called um our mission we're changing changing it to the about page because it not only has information about the mission but it also has some pictures of the people uh a few three of the people in charge and it has those different uh organizations that are collaborators that I just showed you a minute ago so discuss it at the meeting this morning and we thought well maybe about would be a better term for that since the page does a lot more than just say the mission and we already have the mission statement on the homepage anyway so let's find the about page and let's go I have some sections already here that I just copied over so let's see this is a white background section this will work and we'll just copy in what we had here and let me show you some of the the markup so you can see it some of it might be a little weird because i' I've added things in so let's cut it down here um I what I don't want is this card reveal so let's let's get rid of some stuff first just to simplify things and oops I don't need this class activator or this class if you're interested in any of the stuff that I've done so far uh if you look at the commit history and the repo you'll be able to see everything that gets done between videos so you won't miss anything I try to be as descriptive as I can in my uh commits hey we got somebody from Pittsburgh all right um I I'm actually grew up in Weirton uh I don't know if you know where that is uh the uh the M Herman from Pittsburgh so it's it's actually the city in West Virginia that's really North fit borders Pennsylvania and Ohio so I'm about a half hour drive from Pittsburgh I can actually get to the um the west side of Pittsburgh in about 20 25 minutes so awesome it's so cool have people from so many different places so that's that's awesome to see I actually I know I'm missing a lot of stuff I'm sure in the live chat I do go back afterwards and I read everything in the live chat so I will see what you said I might not see it until later if you really if you have a question though put it in the comments so that I can reply to it later on uh if I don't see it in the live chat okay so basically I just removed that little part that was the um the part that got revealed I'll bring it back in to show you so I had this this reveal I remove that part because we're not going to use it for this next set of cards all right we clean it up a little bit we still want it to be hoverable we're still giving this card the style of cursor pointer normally you know you don't really want to put style tags right in here uh in this case it's just easier to um to show you what to do uh also eventually all this I'm going to convert it to react components and I am not really against putting style tags directly into react components I'll probably do a better way than that though but at first this will make it easier to transition over okay so the only other thing we have going on here is we we have this in a row we have it in columns that's just Mater the column classes uh for materialize all we're really worried about here let me separate it out so we can see I I'll put some spaces in um the actual part that's the card is just this stuff here so we just have two divs and a span in there uh for for a title we're actually going to take this out because we don't even want a title this is just a straight image card uh that we're going to do and uh this is such a basic example it's probably in the materialized documentation as well and you could just copy and paste from there the only other weird thing we have going on is we're using Source set to do some responsive images I went over this in a previous video that I did on my channel so uh if you can check that out I'll go in more depth I think I'm going to do maybe a prerecorded video on this at some point uh so you don't have to sift through a whole half hour live stream to find when I went over this but basically all we're doing here is just putting in a different image depending on screen width and resolution but in this case let's switch out I did copy over some of those logos so let's check out our image folder and let's take I'm going to take a logo that has a short name all right osv logo so I'm going to switch this out to what was that do osv logo PN and at this point none of these are really optimized they haven't been compressed or anything uh we're just kind of seeing how it how it all goes let me go to that page so we can see that's the about page now I'll bring it over on the other screen so everybody can see it okay somebody's asking about react I know I've been talking about react every video I was just thinking about that earlier we are definitely going to do react but it's probably going to be next week there's a possibility if I can't get if I don't think I can get it ready by launch which needs to be some point next week uh there may be some delay at the printer for some other marketing for this site so we may get an extension on the date when this has to go live but I'm assuming it has to be live by the 13th of this month if I can't get it converted over to react in that amount of time I'm just going to put up like the static site that's why we're doing the static site first if that's the case then it's possible I won't get to react till the week after that but I definitely will I'm looking forward to it as well I I haven't worked with it in a couple weeks and I I really miss it um I don't know if anybody has worked with react but it's it's for me at least it was kind of hard to wrap my mind around at first but then once I really got into it I it it was cool I I liked it it was fun to work with and uh I kind of like don't want to go back to anything else after that but you got to use sometimes it's it's Overkill to use your act sometimes when you don't have to um oh Zimbabwe awesome we got a viewers some from uh Zimbabwe okay so you can see basically what happened this is the card and we we don't have that um that um if you I forgot to put it on this screen sorry guys okay so now you can see what happened we put that logo in there um we uh I'm clicking it right now and that effect's not happening because we took all that out the only thing we want to add though is we want to add a link so let's pop in an a tag and so this is I don't prepare this stuff ahead of time we're just doing it on the go so uh just just so you know uh I'm trying things out sometimes they don't always work so I don't remember exactly how I usually do this with the a tag so let's just put should I put it here or should I make the image I think the best thing is going to be to wrap this image in the a tag yeah I think that's how I usually do it uh for now I don't remember what this address is for this site so I'm just going to put a hash in there as a placeholder uh whenever you're doing a link uh always put the title in because uh for like screen readers for people uh who have you know Vision impairment and things uh you want that title in also if somebody that covers over the link it'll pop up uh so always keep that in mind that people um have different needs uh for when they're viewing a website so uh it just it only takes an extra second but it could really mean a lot to somebody who's trying to view your site also I like to use uh Target blank if somebody's leaving the site I don't always use this sometimes it can be annoying to people uh it just depends on the context but in this case well sorry about that I just scrolled over I hope nobody's motion sick because I'm kind of move the windows around a lot I know I get motion sick really easily so espe especially like all the new virtual reality stuff I just can't I can't handle most of it so I apologize if all my moving around of these windows is making anybody sick okay so I just saved that it auto refreshes I'm using gulp uh to um live reload this okay so we can see as I hover over that it's going to be really tiny on your screen but maybe you can make out down in the bottom left corner it has it's showing me that there's a URL uh when I hover over this so that's a link so this entire card now is a link it has this cool hover effect it also has a did we put a an click effect no we didn't with materialize there's the option to have like some click effects so when you click on something you get like some waves let's see if it's the one it here there we go it was hard it's hard to see there I don't know if you can see it I'm going to do it one more time it has like this wave that's just emanating from the point where you you click so why2 D somebody asked why two divs for this card why not add class card image within the first div okay so part of the reason why I use this structure well really the entire reason why I use this structure is uh since I'm using a framework materialize I'm I use the structure that that they uh that they recommend in their documentation so in their documentation you do have it if I were making this card myself you're right it it would be so much more simple to just do one div there have been there are some occasions when I do have the cards just I make them myself usually when I want to make sure that cards are all exactly the same height um I use it's easier for me to do that if I have just the card be one if so i' I have done that on occasion but in this case this is just the markup that is required for the framework but in general it is I I like to use less markup if possible uh we had somebody says hi from uh Iraq so uh awesome that's just I I can't believe uh you know we're covering like all parts of the world here so that's great also why do You tab over the image ele why not keep the A and image element the same tab level yeah that's a good point the only reason I did it like this is because this image is uh sorry I let me read that question out loud somebody asked why did I I separate this a element and the image element why not just leave it on one line if they were smaller I would definitely leave it on one line but since I have so much here and I already can't even see the end of it uh I just I put them out on different lines so that I can because usually when I'm editing it's it looks more like this uh so I can see the CSS or the JavaScript and the HTML at the same time so if it's going to be really long I'd rather see it but yeah in general you can really you can just put the image tag and and the a tag on the same line uh that comes from style it depends on what you're doing if you work somewhere where there's like a you know a style for coding like that's strictly enforced you got to go with that I don't have that where I'm at at least not yet I'd like to develop it for when we start getting you know some interns or student workers or things but um for now I can kind of do what I want so I I try to be cons as consistent as I can be uh but occasionally I'm not sometimes you're just in a hurry and uh you forget how to do things all right so the only other thing that I'd want to do with this card is I definitely don't want it this big I'd shrink it down I'm going to try to fit maybe four cards on a line but I want to jump over to something a little bit more complex this is a really simple example and uh if you didn't follow it all just check out the uh the the source code on GitHub I'm going to commit all the stuff from from this live stream as quick as I can after this live stream and then also I'll I'll I'll be working on all the things I'm saying that I'm going to do uh today so hopefully it'll be all be done by the end of the day today so we don't have a lot of time left so let's try to get started on this other card as soon as possible I'm going to flip over I use Trello for my kind of personal project management here uh so we wanted to make cards for collaborators that's just what we did oh I almost forgot I need your help uh we need based on feedback from the meeting this morning uh did a little demo we need a different font for the headers so real quick I want to show you this is the font for the headers that I'm using now it's just it's just robotto so we want a different font and I'll show you what the font is used on the other the old site this is the font that's used it's um EB gamon so I have two fonts that I'm thinking about using me switch so this is the E garamon this is what's being used right now and this is a font I found what is it called sinel okay I kind of really like this bottom font the the thin version of it really struck me that I liked it and I thought it might work for this site but I know um I already know this font would work because this font was already chosen by the people who are in charge of uh of this department that I'm doing the site for but um if I can find a font that's even better I can show them and you know maybe they'll they'll prefer that so I mean I already told you my preference let me know because it's not it's not always about what I think looks good uh I love to get second opinion so let me know in the comments if you can which font you prefer the one on the top is EB gamond the one on the bottom is sinzo you can find those both on Google fonts if you want to take a look at them in more depth or if you have another font F that looks similar to these fonts that you think would be even better let me know at this point I can I can hold off a little while longer before changing the font on these headers so I'm I'm open to suggestions okay we got three minutes let's let's get something done in three minutes okay so the next thing that we're going to do is what's cards for resources okay let's switch this over and let me show you the resources page quickly it probably doesn't matter there's really nothing on the resource page right now but I I'll show you anyway this is the resource page on the old site basically there's going to be two categories there's going to be free resources and resources that you have to pay for so the trick is we need to come up with a card that is going to be able to work for any data type so these resources are going to end up being they could be links to uh text articles okay the um the menu links only work on the homepage for right now since this will probably get changed into react I don't really see the point in building everything out on every page the homepage will be the most complete and then you know the the this nav will be its own component that would just get reused everywhere uh if we end up not having time for that then you know we'll just uh hurry up and copy and paste it all over okay I don't know why I just needed to click on that because it still has all this basic stuff that I copied to all the pages but uh okay it looks like some people oh man we we got people for both both fonts so ah this might be tough we might have a tie here and I'm just going to have to decide anyway um if we do have a tie I don't I don't know what I'll do maybe I'll um I'll use both fonts on different pages and then see what uh see what everybody likes that's actually in charge of this department and see what they think uh but basically we need a card that's going to be able to have to display uh video EDS from YouTube text probably a link to a text article uh images if we have a good image to put with it um or audio so it's going to need like a title space for an image space for title probably a button somewhere uh for a link and you can see here's what you don't really put buttons on cards Google puts you know we have these little things so so you don't you don't put like a raise button on a card in material design uh you can potentially put I I've seen it done where you put like a little round uh action button somewhere here on a card but I don't think we'll need that I don't think that'll be necessary so um I'm thinking a card like this would work we could have an optional image that would maybe uh maybe be there maybe not depending on whether one gets uploaded this works it has a title yeah we definitely need a short description so people know what what it is and I wonder if it would be worth it to differentiate between cards somehow so that people know right away whether this is a paid resource or free resource I don't know what the best way would be I'm thinking maybe I I don't want to do a completely different color but maybe some sort of indication somewhere in the card so that they can know at a glance I have to think about that maybe maybe an icon from I guess the the marketer in me is thinking uh don't don't Mark the paid ones instead Mark the free ones as free and then people will think hey this is awesome it's free but if they see the paid thing they'll say oh that stinks I have to pay for it so that's just me thinking it's it's more positive to see a label that says free than a label that says you got to pay for this uh I don't know at least that's what I a small key icon would work okay a small key icon yeah that's that's cool actually that's a good idea I should just look through some icons and see uh if there's an icon that would work yeah that yeah a little icon that would either maybe go at the end of the title um I was actually thinking like you know kind of a little Banner right here but I think the key would be easier to implement and would would look nice great that's a great idea thank you uh Claude B for that idea all right I know I gotta be running yeah I'm already over on time so sorry about that I really wanted to actually start to build this card out but um I got got sidetracked with a pH fonts but I really do want your help with deciding on the fonts uh cuz I could spend forever looking at fonts and I don't have that time right now so thanks for watching uh thank you for everybody being so awesome in the the live uh chat and for interacting with me and giving me great ideas uh also it's really cool you guys uh kind of shouted out where you were from uh I really like that that was fun so I will be back well today's Friday so have a great week um I will live stream again on Monday 2 p.m Eastern Time same time and I maybe I'll save I don't have to work on these cards I have a lot of other stuff on the site that I could work on that maybe isn't as exciting so probably on Monday we can work on cards or if I find something else that I think will be um interesting maybe we'll do that uh if you have any topics that you really want me to talk about let me know if it's something that I'm going to going to do for the site I can work it in ending yeah the stream's ending I just streamed for a half an hour I don't I I don't want to put people through a super long video when they go to watch the recording so I just do a half hour uh and also I I work a lot slower when I have to narrate so if I did this all day I'd get way less work done uh that task manager I was using is Trello uh I'll write that down I I'll put a link to it in the description it's a free uh thing and um it just lets me do that actually GitHub added something similar to that so there's a feature on GitHub that does that as well I haven't had time to use it yet I may switch to that some point since I'm already using GitHub but for right now i' I'm I'm used to Trello so um maybe I'll do a video on how I I manage uh my stuff a short video on at some point if you guys if you guys want that let me know uh it's trell useful for solo project um yeah sorry if I don't want this video to go too long but uh you still have questions I'll answer questions for a couple more minutes um let's see is Trello useful for your work solo projects yes Trello is definitely useful for solo projects um I'll just show you quickly let me move this off the screen like I said I'd like to maybe do a a video on this but just really quickly to show you uh let me see if I can make this bigger so you can see see the font okay okay so I um I have it separated into these lists so in Trello everything's in a list and then cards so I have todo ready for development in progress testing and done every task is broken up into these these lists into these cards and so I can open it up I can put this was the font task so I had the links to those fonts I showed you in here you can attach files and pictures and things if I was working in a team I could assign a task to somebody and they'd be able to see it too and you could you know share share your boards with with your team or whoever you need to you could even share it with your clients uh if you wanted them to see the progress and have them uh you know you could maybe put a screenshot in or something and ask their opinion on some something or have them add things so it's really cool uh like I say even if it's solo uh I I use it pretty much solo all the time in my department we have a different project management system that we use for the whole department it's called Reich uh so I I update tasks in there but no one else in my department really cares or needs to know all the little tasks so for that I use this because it's just so fast I also have these little numbers here uh these are Pomodoro Cycles so um every 25 minutes I take a little break I have a timer for that so I estimate how many 25 minute periods each of these tasks will take so for right now to create the cards for the resources which we were just talking about I estimate that it would take me three 25 minute periods when I'm done I put so let me show you when that's done when I'm done at the end I put how long it actually took so I want to change the the mission page to the about page I estimated it would take an entire 25 minute period which is crazy I I don't know why I said it would take that long it only took me half of that time probably less than half of it so now I can go back and see what I estimated you know for this everything that's done I've estimated 7.5 cycles and it's only taken me six so it gives me a good idea the more I do this the closer I get so um I'm able when somebody comes to me like you know when my boss or the head of my department comes in and says how long is it going to be I can look look at all these todos and how much I have left and I say okay I have 397 so I can add this section up and I know about how long it's going to take me before the site is finished and um that's really cool there's some other cool charting stuff you can do with this I don't really use that a lot uh I imagine it would be more helpful maybe if you were on a team uh but this is really helped me to get my estimates you know kind of On Target that was always the hardest thing for me especially when I was like freelancing uh you know when all my my work was freelance work it was really hard for me to try to get a handle on you know how how long is the project going to take uh but this kind of forces me to estimate every little thing and it's so much easier to estimate a small task than to try to estimate a big task so if you break it down estimate each one individually and then add it all up you'll be so much closer to an accurate uh an accurate number calculate buing okay Claud B asked do you use that to calculate your hours or bilding or to get better at estimating yeah okay so pretty much everything um all of the above uh it it does it does work well actually if I'm calculating my hours um this video is going to be a little longer so I I guess that's cool uh let's see do you think it's possible for 15yearold to make it in web design freelancing oh yeah I think a 15yearold could definitely get get work um uh a guy that I used to work with a lot and he actually got me I wasn't doing web design for a lot I had got into it a little bit uh when I was in high school and done a little bit of work and uh then I got away from it I was actually teaching high school and then I I quit teaching I did some stuff in the stock market for a little bit and then this guy was in um this guy I went to high school with was doing web design stuff and he needed somebody to work with so he got got me back into it and he was awesome awesome mentor and uh got me introduced to a lot of good clients and a lot of experience but he actually started when he was really young he's a couple years younger than me so he was maybe 15 when he got started and he was doing work for he he has an uncle that has a marketing company and he was doing work for his uncle as a teenager and making making money so definitely just uh try to be as professional as you can be and um you know it's it can't hurt to to ask to propose things you know uh go around you know just you go around a local places uh I I don't recommend going on like kind of the freelancing job boards to be honest with you I haven't had much success with that uh usually you don't really make a lot of money uh people are out bidding a lot so uh I I kind of think it's better to just um go out and try to get contacts like actual personal contacts either through the internet by talking to people on you know social media and forms and things or in in your local community uh that's I've gotten the most clients and the best clients from my connections my personal connections and from referrals from other clients uh I was trying to ask answer somebody else's question oh okay somebody asked me about billing let me show you real quick and this will probably be the last thing I go over uh let me show you how I track my projects so I'm going to bring this over and uh this is going to be small but that's okay because you don't really need to see everything but this this might seem crazy to you but for for the University right now every project that I've been working on has its own tab in this spreadsheet at the bottom here so I put the date the number of hours that I've worked and then a quick summary of what I've done these summaries are basically the same thing I put in my G commits and um I have a total at the bottom now for my job now I don't get paid hourly so this is basically just a way for me to keep track that if I have to go in for a performance review I can say you know this this project brought in you know so much money to the university if you would have had to contract this out to somebody it would have cost you so much money you know if you were CH paying it hourly so that's what this allows me to do it's it's kind of nice to be able to go in and tell my boss like you know hey youve you saved a ton of money by hiring me and having me me do this work uh so that's kind of I was already used to doing this for my clients on the side so I just kept doing it when I started working here about two years ago and uh it still comes in handy for me and uh when I have clients I I actually just use that sorry I flipped over when I have clients next to this number will actually be my how much they they're paying me so if it is an hourly job I'll just multiply this number by what the hourly rate is and right here I'll have the um the amount they owe me usually it's so I have some recurring clients so each of these tabs would then be a month so I would have one spreadsh sheeet per client and then each month they would get build based on the uh the total number here so I hope that's helpful I'm there's probably better ways to do that and I'm sure there are services that can do that but uh we have to be extremely organized yeah uh it is it's good to be organized uh when you do all this stuff I guess you don't have to be it depends on where you're working at but it definitely helps it it for sure helps if you're on your own like it really helps uh if especially if you need to keep track of things for tax purposes uh then the more documentation you have for everything then it's better or if you ever have to if a client doesn't want to pay and starts asking you what did you really do well you have very detailed evidence of everything you've done on that site at that point so I've went over a lot longer than I anticipated and the chat's kind of slowing down so uh I'm going to go but have a great weekend I'll be back on Monday and thanks for watching
