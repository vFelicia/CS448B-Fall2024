00:01 - all right for this last video there are
00:03 - three things that i really want to
00:04 - stress the first of which is these tools
00:07 - are so useful and so awesome and when i
00:10 - first learned about them i was really
00:11 - intimidated and didn't see how they
00:12 - could apply to me
00:14 - and that was a mistake i should have
00:15 - just gotten in there and played around
00:17 - more because i think i would be more
00:18 - comfortable now
00:19 - the second thing is in case you haven't
00:21 - heard me say it enough
00:23 - read the documentation
00:25 - it's awesome while you're playing around
00:27 - with it read some documentation try it
00:29 - out see what you can do i've even been
00:31 - in the chat room asking i've been
00:33 - looking for buggy pages so i could debug
00:35 - them and people are really helpful
00:36 - they'll give you a page that they think
00:38 - really could use some help
00:40 - um third of all a lot of these tabs that
00:42 - these videos have gone over
00:44 - do similar things a lot of them have to
00:46 - do with how long executing a certain
00:48 - thing takes
00:50 - and
00:51 - that can be intimidating if you know
00:53 - there's a problem but you're not sure
00:54 - where to start
00:55 - that's okay
00:57 - something that works best for you might
00:58 - not be the same thing that works best
01:00 - for somebody else once you figure it out
01:02 - it will get easier
01:03 - and a little bonus there is this
01:06 - um
01:07 - device mode that i showed you a little
01:08 - bit at the beginning but i want to play
01:10 - around with it now so it's this little
01:12 - it looks like a little phone next to the
01:14 - search button so i this is what it looks
01:15 - like without it this is my regular code
01:17 - my regular code pen i'm going to click
01:19 - this little button and here this is an
01:22 - apple ipad this is what it would look
01:23 - like and it functions too
01:25 - i click the more button
01:27 - and it just does it it even i can change
01:30 - the network so if somebody's on wi-fi in
01:32 - case my page is big enough where that's
01:34 - going to make a difference this is an
01:35 - amy polar quote because she's fantastic
01:38 - um
01:39 - so there's your own devices you can also
01:41 - just make it your own so like well how
01:43 - would it look on something
01:45 - you know this size
01:47 - and you can try it and see how it goes
01:49 - it's an awesome tool
01:51 - i hope you guys enjoyed these videos
01:52 - have fun playing around with the
01:54 - devtools
