00:00 - Yo, what's up? It's yoroomie, and in this video,
00:03 - I'm going to talk to you about how I built a chatbot in hours.
00:06 - This is over the weekend.
00:08 - Launched it and generated thousands of messages via this chatbot.
00:13 - If you're interested in building your own chatbot, this video is for you.
00:16 - Let me talk to you a little bit more about why I built this chatbot.
00:20 - I've been someone that has been reading a lot about chatbots,
00:26 - in literally--even on Chatbots Magazine.
00:28 - I've seen BotList's Seth. He's the founder of BotList. He's incredible.
00:31 - I've seen all of his posts on, you know--I follow him on Facebook and on Twitter and everywhere.
00:37 - And I see all these chatbots that have been launched on product time.
00:40 - It was definitely something that I needed to learn more about,
00:43 - and for me the easiest way to learn something is by immersing myself in that
00:47 - and by building a side project and doing it.
00:51 - And my goal was not only learn about chatbots,
00:53 - but learn about the chatbot ecosystem and the tools that were out there.
00:57 - I found myself looking on an actual--on a browser window.
01:01 - and I was looking at some artwork from an artist that I like--
01:05 - Alec Monopoly.
01:06 - So you might have seen some of his work.
01:08 - It's kind of like the monopoly man graffiti street art.
01:11 - But I'm pretty much obsessed a lot of his work and some other artworks,
01:15 - so I was like, "Why don't I build a chat bot
01:18 - for people to discover artists' artwork and purchase all through messenger?"
01:23 - So I kind of come up with this, like, initial idea,
01:26 - and just out of, like, the fact that I like artwork
01:29 - and that would be a cool way to get involved and combine my interest
01:33 - through this project of a chatbot.
01:35 - First off, it's like, all right, like, let's just start to Google
01:38 - and, you know, and look on Product Hunt
01:40 - and see if there's any kind of art chat bot that's out there.
01:43 - Well, as I just said Art Chatbot, that's exactly how I came upon the name.
01:47 - So I immediately went to GoDaddy, and I typed in www.artchatbot.com
01:53 - and to my surprise, man, it was available.
01:55 - So I click purchase on that. $9.99. I had the domain name.
01:59 - Just like with StudioTime, I used a Squarespace logo generator,
02:04 - which is like a visual kind of logo creation tool,
02:06 - so I didn't have to use Photoshop.
02:09 - I didn't have to use Sketch or any sophisticated design tool.
02:13 - I simply used Squarespace's logo generator to generate the initial logo for Art Chatbot.
02:18 - So I had the name, domain, and logo.
02:22 - Now I needed to figure out: 
how am I actually gonna build this?
02:24 - So I started researching some tools
02:28 - and then also joining some of the chatbot developer groups on Facebook,
02:32 - which I can link down here to some of those
02:35 - which are a huge resource in a lot of, you know, knowledge sharing going on
02:38 - But I found Chatfuel.
02:40 - So Chatfuel is an easy way to create a chatbot,
02:43 - and it's basically a visual, kind of, chatbot creation platform,
02:48 - and I started to just see what the other options were,
02:51 - and I just said okay.
02:52 - I'm just gonna commit to using chatfuel, learn how to use it.
02:55 - So I signed up for chatfuel.
02:56 - Super easy platform to use, by the way.
02:58 - They actually have templates that--that are on there
03:01 - so you can get started using a template  and modify it towards your needs.
03:06 - Now, once I created my account through chatfuel,
03:09 - and the Facebook page for Art Chatbot,
03:12 - which I needed because that's how people were going to send a message to Art Chatbot,
03:18 - I just, kind of, started using one of their placeholder templates,
03:20 - and I just understood from there
03:24 - chatbots are all about conversation design.
03:26 - So just like when you road--when you roadmap an app or even a website--
03:32 - kind of the wire framing process--
03:33 - you can use that simple process to actually create the chatbot using chatfuel.
03:39 - So you can think about things like blocks,
03:42 - and so when someone types an initial message,
03:44 - you know, this block then goes to a next block,
03:48 - and you're gonna have different variable blocks
03:50 - to send them different messages or display other information,
03:54 - and then all of that together composes this kind of conversational design of the chatbot.
04:00 - It's really not that complicated.
04:01 - You know, to be honest, it's probably one of the easiest things I've ever built,
04:05 - and that's Art Chatbot.
04:07 - So within about 30 minutes,
04:09 - I had the initial template in place for Art Chatbot,
04:14 - and I just started testing, real-time, the messaging on this,
04:18 - and just started iterating the conversational design of what Art Chatbot would be
04:23 - and what it actually is now in the stages it is live.
04:26 - And I'll link down here and screenshot, also, the website that I created
04:30 - and you can actually test it out yourself
04:33 - and let me know what you think and give me some feedback on it
04:35 - I'll, you know, obviously want to improve it.
04:37 - But you can kind of get a really good idea of that conversation design of Art Chatbot.
04:42 - So in about 30 minutes to an hour,
04:44 - I had this initial version of the Art Chatbot actually built.
04:49 - What I did from there was
04:51 - I wanted to go ahead and get people to start using this.
04:56 - What I did was I actually open-sourced most of the build.
04:59 - In doing that, I started to tweet about what I was doing.
05:02 - I let people first off know, "Hey, I'm building a side project, Art Chatbot" on Twitter.
05:08 - I started to join and post in a lot of these groups
05:12 - for, you know, chatbot developers and chatbot communities on Facebook.
05:15 - I also shared on my personal Facebook.
05:17 - I also shared on my Instagram, which I'll link down here.
05:20 - It's @yoroomie, and then I also Instagramed stories.
05:24 - And I really showed people what I was doing.
05:27 - As I was doing that, people were becoming aware of this chatbot project that I was building.
05:33 - They were giving me feedback, being involved in the process,
05:37 - and obviously once I had this ready to launch,
05:39 - some people already knew of what I was doing
05:44 - and they were aware of it, and they had, kind of, participated in it in some sense in their mind.
05:48 - So I had some initial first users and an initial traction before I'd even launched.
05:53 - Keep in mind, this is literally within about the first hour to, you know, two hours.
05:58 - As I was going through this process
05:59 - and letting people know what I was doing and sharing more on the project,
06:04 - I also created a Google Doc where I was going to create a public product roadmap
06:09 - so people could contribute their feedback and their potential feature requests to this chatbot
06:16 - all via link and I created a bitly short link to that so I could send that,
06:20 - you know, on all my social and I could track that,
06:23 - but I wanted people to be involved in this project
06:26 - because if they were, then they were going to have some investment in the project
06:30 - and be more willing to probably share it
06:32 - and I could build some initial, kind of, traction and momentum as I launched.
06:35 - So people at this time were aware of what I was doing.
06:40 - They were giving me some feedback. I was, kind of, taking that feedback.
06:42 - I was adding it to the Google Doc.
06:45 - Then at the same time, I was being very open and honest
06:48 - about how many users, you could say, the chatbot had
06:52 - and then the amount of messages that it was sending.
06:54 - So I was sharing the analytics, and that is actually something that is interesting to a lot of people.
07:00 - What I found out is people want to know, you know,
07:03 - not only in the process of how you build these things,
07:05 - but also, like, how do you actually launch these
07:09 - and how effective are the launches?
07:11 - Are people messaging it? If so, what are the actual analytics like?
07:15 - So these--these are things that typically startups don't share as much,
07:19 - so I was being open and honest and open sourcing most of this,
07:22 - which was actually its own, kind of, angle of interest
07:25 - that people started becoming interested in.
07:28 - So at that time, I had initial chatbot built,
07:31 - and I had an initial, kind of, community around this that I had created in the first users.
07:37 - One of the biggest objectives for having a chatbot website
07:41 - is not only to let people know about what the chatbot is and the functionality
07:46 - but simply to get people to message it
07:48 - because once you send a message to a chatbot, that is technically considered a user.
07:53 - And I'll just use air quotes because that's, you know, loosely defined.
07:56 - But that is an opt-in. That's considered a user.
07:59 - And for analytics, that starts the messages that are counted as messages that you send out.
08:04 - I'll link to it down here, and I'll screenshot with you the current website,
08:09 - but it is www.artchatbot.com.
08:13 - But as you can see I just simply have the name, the logo, the tagline.
08:19 - I have a large button that's the call to action,
08:22 - then I have a visual image of the Art Chatbot,
08:25 - and some of the artwork that's displayed,
08:28 - and then also at the very bottom in the footer,
08:30 - I do have a link to that open source Google Doc
08:35 - so people that come to the site can not only see Art Chatbot,
08:40 - not only send it a message,
08:41 - but be aware of,
08:42 - "hey, you can contribute your feedback to Art Chatbot
08:46 - and you can see the analytics real-time, kind of, open source of this project
08:51 - and stay up to date and in the loop with this."
08:53 - I've actually found that there's been thousands of hits to that Google Doc
08:57 - and a lot of people are very interested in how many messages are being sent too
09:02 - and contributing to this.
09:04 - So it's just been a really cool project for me,
09:05 - and not only have I learned a lot about chatbots--
09:08 - you know, built out a network of other chatbot developers,
09:13 - of people that are working on, you know, building chatbot, kind of, tools--
09:16 - the developer ecosystem--
09:18 - but also, too, perfecting my process of not only how do I approach side projects, but how do I build them?
09:23 - How do I market them?
09:26 - How do I share more information about these projects to people?
09:30 - And then also learning, what are people interested in, you know, seeing with these side projects?
09:34 - And really sharing it.
09:36 - So that's one of the biggest things that I like doing
09:38 - is just being open and honest
09:40 - and open sourcing a lot of these side projects and sharing with people.
09:44 - Hopefully you know a little bit more about Art Chatbot,
09:47 - how I'm approaching chatbots,
09:49 - and how I got started building this,
09:51 - how effective it's been.
09:53 - I'll link down below to all the tools and resources that I used to build this chatbot.
09:58 - And hit subscribe,
09:59 - so that way I can keep making these videos.
10:02 - And comment below to let me know any questions that you have
10:05 - on chatbots or anything relevant to this
10:08 - and also what you want me to make my next video on.
10:11 - See you.

Yo, what's up? It's yoroomie, and in this video, I'm going to talk to you about how I built a chatbot in hours. This is over the weekend.
