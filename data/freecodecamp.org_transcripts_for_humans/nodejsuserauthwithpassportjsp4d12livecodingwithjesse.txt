00:08 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:11 - with Jesse
00:12 - I'm so sorry about starting this late I
00:16 - can see you've all been busy in the live
00:20 - chat so hopefully there was some good
00:23 - conversation going on I have not had a
00:27 - chance to read any of this so I'm
00:33 - scrolling through it now all right so I
00:40 - was as supposed to have a very brief
00:44 - conversation and it turned into a almost
00:47 - two-hour meeting so that's why I started
00:50 - late I thought I would have plenty of
00:52 - time to get started or to get ready for
00:56 - the stream and stream but it didn't
00:57 - happen like that so I guess as a as
01:07 - asking how the meetings were actually
01:09 - the meetings they there are basically
01:16 - about all the projects that we're going
01:17 - to be doing for the next year I
01:19 - shouldn't say all of them I'm sure some
01:21 - other things will come up but I have a
01:24 - much better idea about what I'll be
01:27 - working on and how that that main
01:32 - website so mentioned a few days ago the
01:34 - main University website franciscan CD
01:37 - you will be completely redoing that
01:40 - front end and back end I have a much
01:45 - better a clearer picture of what's
01:48 - wanted for that and what's what the
01:51 - design is going to be like so I'll be
01:56 - sharing that with you in future streams
01:59 - but I know I have we sketched out some
02:04 - things on a whiteboard and I took a
02:05 - picture of it so I wouldn't forget so
02:07 - I'll be will be working on it but it was
02:13 - a long
02:13 - but it did we sorted quite a few things
02:17 - out one thing that we are going to be
02:19 - working on within the next two weeks or
02:22 - so and we'll see maybe I'll do it on a
02:24 - stream maybe I won't it depends on if
02:26 - you are interested we're going to try to
02:28 - take so the main website right now has
02:31 - an event system that's really hard to to
02:36 - work with in terms of adding the content
02:38 - for the events so we're going to take I
02:43 - may as well give you something to look
02:45 - at what we're talking about this to you
02:50 - all right so what we're gonna do not in
02:54 - this stream but in the next week or so
02:57 - we're gonna redo the events so that
03:00 - we'll use some third-party systems so
03:03 - here's here's right now how the events
03:05 - show up and there are other places
03:09 - throughout the website that these events
03:10 - show up for now I think we'll just worry
03:15 - about this spot but we're going to
03:17 - remove all of this and replace it and
03:21 - instead we're going to pool events from
03:24 - some other systems so it may be a Google
03:26 - Calendar it might be Eventbrite it may
03:29 - be a custom post type from WordPress
03:32 - installation however so someone else in
03:37 - my department is in charge of entering
03:39 - in the data for these events whatever
03:42 - they decide is going to be the best
03:43 - system for them that's going to you save
03:47 - them as much time as possible
03:49 - we're going to work with that system so
03:51 - I don't know what it'll be right up you
03:53 - know right away but it's going to be
03:54 - something that definitely it has to have
03:56 - an API so we're going to replace all of
04:01 - this with whatever that system is that's
04:05 - going to hopefully free up some time for
04:07 - this other person and they're gonna
04:09 - learn react they're actually going to do
04:12 - a clone of our project one the the cata
04:14 - catechol Institute website they're going
04:16 - to do a clone of that and they're going
04:18 - to use that for another University
04:21 - website and in the process hopefully
04:23 - they're going to learn react so if
04:24 - somebody else in
04:25 - department that can can do react sites
04:28 - so that's right so my job in the next
04:32 - week or two is to free up their time by
04:34 - making this event system a lot easier to
04:37 - work with
04:37 - so that's coming if you're interested in
04:41 - that then let me know I'll try to stream
04:46 - when we do that so let me know we'll see
04:51 - I'm still undecided as to whether it's
04:54 - it'll be worth it to stream okay so
04:58 - today I don't know what did I say we're
05:02 - gonna do today
05:03 - Passport yeah passport j/s okay I'm just
05:17 - briefly checking the live chat see if
05:21 - there's anything I should address right
05:23 - away before we get started okay I'll
05:31 - probably be probably missing a lot of
05:33 - things since I'm skimming through so
05:34 - quickly but it looks okay it doesn't
05:39 - look like there's is anything here okay
05:44 - so here's what I'm going to do I'm gonna
05:46 - start my 25-minute Pomodoro timer if
05:48 - you've asked the question I will get to
05:51 - it after we do our first coding session
05:53 - of 25 minutes so I'll take a five-minute
05:54 - break and then I'll start going through
05:56 - questions no matter what at the end of
05:59 - the stream I'll go through all the
06:00 - questions so please don't feel like
06:02 - you're being ignored if I haven't
06:04 - answered your question yet I'm just
06:06 - gonna break it up a little bit and get
06:08 - to the questions a little bit later so
06:10 - hang in there and I will try to answer
06:12 - your question at first here's what I
06:17 - think we're going to do
06:19 - Harshit has added a pull request that
06:23 - did a lot of work to the server so
06:26 - before we try to implement anything with
06:29 - passport j/s on the server we're better
06:31 - off merging that in I think that'll be
06:33 - much easier to handle to do it that way
06:36 - instead of trying to handle
06:38 - all the merge conflicts that will happen
06:39 - so I've already pulled down I'm gonna
06:43 - double-check and make sure that
06:44 - nothing's been added to his pull request
06:47 - but otherwise earlier I've already
06:49 - pulled it down as a separate branch so
06:51 - it shouldn't be that hard to just merge
06:53 - it in right from the command line so on
06:57 - my other screen I have this pull request
06:59 - open I'm just verifying that the last
07:03 - commit let's see the last commit was
07:13 - okay so there has not it looks like
07:16 - there has not been another commit since
07:18 - the last time I pulled everything down
07:20 - so that's great okay so let me bring
07:27 - this over then see all can see it so I
07:38 - was about to do it anyway okay so
07:46 - briefly give this a look and
07:57 - let's see so you can see we have some
08:00 - extra things here we're doing you know
08:02 - webbing emailed ojs file that's handling
08:05 - sending the emails from our form also
08:09 - attachments the app touch as file in the
08:12 - end the server has a lot of extra stuff
08:15 - in there too using a motor to handle
08:18 - form data we have fetch working in here
08:23 - so we have some stuff set up I can't
08:27 - remember how much of this was from a
08:29 - previous pull request and how much was
08:30 - this this last one so maybe going over
08:33 - some stuff that we've already seen but I
08:37 - had a little bit of trouble getting
08:38 - things to work I don't think it had
08:40 - anything to do with with any of the code
08:43 - I think it had something to do with me
08:44 - setting up an account to handle the mail
08:48 - so I'm gonna go ahead and pull this in
08:50 - but if if you happen to clone this
08:54 - repository and it doesn't work for you
08:57 - when you try to submit the form I'm
08:59 - aware that something's wrong with the
09:01 - way I'm doing it so as soon as I figure
09:05 - that out then I'll let you know
09:07 - I wasn't harsh it had given me some
09:09 - suggestions for how to troubleshoot that
09:11 - but I've been in meetings for three
09:15 - hours straight so I have not been able
09:17 - to even attempt to to troubleshoot so
09:21 - tell you I had an issue but I just
09:24 - really didn't have time to try to fix it
09:25 - so I'm not that worried about it let's
09:30 - see all right let's merge this in so
09:34 - just I'm just going to double check and
09:37 - make sure I don't have anything in
09:38 - master that should have been merged okay
09:42 - great we're up to date I'm gonna go back
09:48 - to the master branch and I'm gonna run a
09:49 - git merge and I'm gonna merge in this
09:56 - branch which contains all the work that
09:58 - Harsha did and merge it into master
10:01 - there we go I'm just I think I already
10:05 - brought everything in in terms of the
10:07 - packages but I'm gonna run your own
10:09 - again just to be sure yep
10:10 - we're good so make sure that you do that
10:13 - if you bring in this this latest code
10:15 - locally to your machine be sure to run
10:19 - an NPM install or yarn because there's
10:22 - quite a few packages that that have been
10:25 - added okay great so now that we have
10:28 - that in there we can get to work on
10:31 - actually let me push that up there we go
10:39 - just want to make sure make sure that I
10:41 - push that so in case you all want to get
10:44 - the latest the latest code pulled down
10:48 - on your machines you have it now and see
11:17 - let me bring over let's see I'm John I
11:27 - have a lot of stuff open a lot of
11:29 - windows on my other screen so I'm just a
11:31 - little little clutter and I didn't have
11:33 - a chance to unclutter things before the
11:35 - stream okay here it is alright so let me
11:39 - bring this over this is the github repo
11:43 - for passport j/s which is what we're
11:45 - going to be using so you can check that
11:48 - out if you like um actually I'll paste
11:51 - in the live chat the link and that way
11:58 - you can you can go right there if you
12:00 - want to look at it and also here's the
12:07 - link to the main site and to the docs so
12:13 - we'll be going off looking at these docs
12:16 - I know this is really small I'll zoom in
12:19 - a bit but this is the passport Jay s dot
12:24 - work site so here's what we need to do
12:28 - though the way at least from what I've
12:31 - read so far the way passport UAS works
12:34 - is that there are a lot of these extra
12:37 - modules that you can use depending on
12:40 - what kind of authentication you want so
12:44 - we need to we need to come to a decision
12:48 - about what do we want what we want to do
12:50 - with authentication and I'm not I have
12:57 - an idea what I want to do but I'm not a
12:59 - hundred percent sure so I'm gonna run
13:00 - some things by you all and and see what
13:04 - what you think and if anyone has any
13:08 - input so currently
13:18 - let's see currently we at the university
13:24 - use for all the accounts I believe it's
13:29 - it's Active Directory and right now the
13:35 - single sign-on system that all the other
13:37 - university stuff is tied into but not
13:40 - the bulletin that we're working on I
13:42 - think is using I'm gonna say sam'l it's
13:47 - saml I'm not really sure how people say
13:50 - that normally I've only ever read it but
13:54 - I don't currently have all the
13:56 - information I need to implement that
13:58 - system I think the best case scenario
14:02 - would be to get on that same system and
14:05 - then all user accounts will be handled
14:08 - by the IT department which which would
14:13 - be really nice so it would all be one
14:15 - system and I I think that would be
14:18 - what's best for the users and then that
14:20 - would be what's best for me as well and
14:24 - not having to continually perform you
14:28 - know maintenance tasks to make sure
14:30 - everybody can log in and handle support
14:33 - calls about login issues which is fine
14:37 - but that's not really what my position
14:38 - is supposed to do I'd much rather spend
14:41 - time building new things so I'm not sure
14:47 - how on board IT is with sharing the
14:53 - information I need to bring that into
14:55 - the system
14:58 - I'll need to do some more work in terms
15:00 - of talking to people before I can get to
15:04 - that point so I'm wondering if I should
15:09 - just go ahead and implement all the code
15:10 - and assume that I'm going to get the
15:12 - information that I need it sometime in
15:17 - the next few days I mean meaning like
15:19 - next week or should we try to use some
15:22 - other type of basic system assuming that
15:26 - maybe we
15:27 - be able to tie in the university system
15:29 - and so we'll have to do something else
15:30 - on our own I'm not sure so basically the
15:36 - choices as I see it is start building it
15:41 - out to use sam'l hoping that we get the
15:45 - other information we need from the IT
15:47 - department to finish that at some point
15:49 - next week or do we just pick a different
15:52 - system for users to be able to log in
15:56 - and implement that and then if we
16:00 - eventually get information for an IT we
16:02 - can switch over to something else but
16:04 - for now we we could do something
16:10 - different so if anybody has any opinions
16:12 - on that let me know I'm gonna give it
16:15 - maybe like 30 seconds a minute just to
16:17 - get some feedback otherwise I'm just
16:21 - gonna have to flip a coin or something
16:23 - I'm have to figure it out I guess if you
16:26 - need some more info on what I need to do
16:28 - is basically what I need is only people
16:34 - who work for the university should be
16:36 - able to login I don't have access to a
16:40 - list of all the people that work for the
16:41 - University the best I have is that
16:45 - somebody who has a university email and
16:48 - if I could verify that they actually
16:50 - have access to that email by sending an
16:56 - email link that's the only way that I
16:59 - can do this at this point so whatever I
17:02 - do I need it so that the bulletin is
17:07 - only accessible by people with a
17:10 - Franciscan ddu email address so
17:16 - something like a password this login
17:19 - with an email link is what we're using
17:21 - right now through a different system I
17:24 - want to switch
17:25 - I haven't the system I'm using currently
17:28 - hasn't been a hundred percent reliable
17:31 - so I don't want to do it the exact same
17:32 - way but if we could figure out some way
17:35 - to you an email link password this login
17:37 - that'll work for now and then I guess
17:40 - we get hope that we we can tie it in in
17:43 - a better way later on let's see all
17:53 - right I'm gonna check out the live chat
17:55 - now and see what you all you all think
17:58 - okay okay so we do have password let's
18:03 - log in some of your saying we should do
18:06 - password this at least Sebastian says if
18:10 - it were me I wouldn't even try to do any
18:12 - type of login until you are sure of what
18:14 - you need and what you can use yeah I
18:19 - mean that's not really a bad idea I just
18:21 - I feel like we're getting to the point
18:22 - where I need to start doing something
18:24 - with this because in terms of the
18:27 - project itself we have all the main
18:29 - pieces there we just have a couple more
18:31 - UI things to work out but I think we're
18:34 - getting close to this being you know
18:38 - usable I mean it's certainly you it's
18:42 - currently is usable it's not perfect but
18:46 - it fulfills all the requirements that we
18:48 - need right now at this point and the
18:50 - last requirement left is to make sure
18:52 - that its users have to be authenticated
18:55 - to access this this site so that's why I
19:00 - just want to kind of move on with it one
19:02 - way or another
19:08 - okay
19:14 - okay was umberto says that's how I
19:16 - implemented our HR web portal in
19:19 - register screen active directory pool
19:22 - email address there were no user entry
19:25 - allowed interesting
19:27 - okay cool harsh it actually has a link
19:30 - to a passport password list great you
19:34 - know what I thought there was a password
19:35 - list module I was looking for it
19:37 - yesterday but I couldn't find it in
19:40 - their list of modules on their on their
19:42 - website there's like 300 models on their
19:45 - website though and I was just scanning
19:47 - through so I I probably just missed it
19:50 - let's see
20:03 - but I was pretty sure that I had seen
20:05 - the password list login system used with
20:12 - passport before in a tutorial that I saw
20:15 - probably months ago let's see okay so I
20:20 - see this NPM passport password list do
20:23 - they have a github usually there's a
20:26 - link to the github right there but I
20:28 - don't see it
20:45 - here we go
21:00 - all right so I found it great so found
21:05 - the github repo for this let me pull
21:06 - this over let's check this out and see
21:12 - see if this will work actually I see a
21:16 - lot activity in the live chat too so
21:18 - let's see
21:29 - okay
21:35 - let's see
21:48 - all right let me see I'm Bertos
21:50 - explaining how he set this up so let me
21:53 - go through some of this stuff as well
21:56 - they're just there's just been a lot in
21:57 - the last chat with in the last 30
21:59 - seconds or so
22:02 - okay so embarrassin saying send a
22:05 - verification email and then add user to
22:07 - identity server or the identity store
22:11 - then the next time they access the
22:13 - system if they are registered it uses a
22:16 - D violin doz login to authenticate and
22:18 - authorize cool I mean that's that's what
22:28 - I really want to do I just don't have I
22:34 - don't really have information or access
22:37 - to what we're currently doing with with
22:39 - a D with Active Directory
22:54 - okay so it looks like Harshit saying
22:57 - there are two different ones here so
22:59 - there's a just password list and then
23:02 - there's a password password this he's
23:04 - recommending to use the one that's just
23:06 - password lists okay as we could check
23:12 - that one out as well hmm
23:47 - hmm
23:49 - okay so I'm looking at this password
23:52 - this as well okay interesting
24:06 - here's now here's another thing to keep
24:09 - in mind I don't know the answer this I'm
24:13 - just I'm asking so right now we're
24:19 - comparing these two different modules
24:20 - one is works with Passport
24:25 - the other one it looks like just works
24:29 - on its own it's it's not tied in with
24:32 - Passport what I hope will happen is at
24:37 - some point we'll switch away from this
24:38 - and will actually be tied in more
24:42 - closely with the single sign-on system
24:44 - that the university is using if that's
24:48 - the case would it be better now even
24:52 - let's let's assume for a second that
24:54 - this password list is better than
24:57 - passport password this even if that is
25:01 - the case would it be better to just
25:04 - implement this passport password list
25:06 - knowing that we're going to switch to
25:07 - some other passport solution maybe
25:11 - password passport sam'l or something
25:13 - like that I don't know I'm wondering
25:20 - what what opinion you all have on that
25:36 - hmm
25:52 - I actually already have an email Jas
25:54 - account set up so it wouldn't be that
25:56 - hard to put that in
26:17 - hmm
26:24 - okay let's check this one out briefly
26:27 - and let's see
26:44 - okay so it looks like a few you're
26:49 - saying in the live chat here that if I
26:51 - do plan on switching to use sam'l with
26:55 - Passport
26:56 - then maybe I should set it up just to
26:58 - use Passport right now okay that's kind
27:05 - of what I was thinking I wanted I just
27:08 - looked through the passport password
27:11 - lists I just want to take a brief glance
27:13 - at this password list repository just to
27:22 - see if anything stands out that could be
27:24 - a deal-breaker okay
28:40 - hmm
29:08 - okay
29:10 - interesting I I didn't really see
29:14 - anything in either one that makes me
29:17 - really want to choose one or the other I
29:24 - mean I just looking at the documentation
29:27 - this one seems a bit more simple it
29:32 - could be that just it doesn't explain as
29:35 - much in the documentation though - so
29:40 - all right let's see all right okay harsh
29:53 - it says we should check out password
29:55 - list dotnet
30:21 - hmm
30:53 - okay just to keep in mind as well I'm
30:58 - gonna throw this up here this is what I
31:00 - was thinking of using passport saml so
31:04 - if anybody's interested in checking that
31:10 - out I'm hoping at some point that we
31:13 - implement this or something like it so I
31:19 - came through the link in as well into
31:22 - the live chat
31:27 - Harshit says you can also send SMS with
31:30 - it it the SMS thing is cool but I can't
31:33 - I can't use the SMS right now because
31:37 - the it has to be the email so I wouldn't
31:40 - I wouldn't be able to use it because the
31:43 - email is the only way I can really make
31:47 - sure that it's somebody that works at
31:49 - the University because they have an
31:51 - active University email account
32:03 - okay let me take a break now and answer
32:05 - some questions we didn't didn't actually
32:08 - get any code worked out but as soon as
32:12 - we as soon as I make a decision we will
32:15 - get some code let's see
32:28 - okay
32:34 - all right Blake Blake says could you
32:37 - link their email to their phone number
32:41 - actually that's interesting that might
32:44 - be possible hmm I'll consider that let's
32:52 - see all right I'm gonna scroll up and
32:58 - try to go through and answer some
33:00 - questions it looks like yeah I don't I
33:08 - don't have everything that was in the
33:09 - live chat so it cut off so if you ask
33:12 - something closer to the very beginning
33:16 - of when the stream was supposed to start
33:18 - I can't see it anymore so I'm sorry
33:21 - about that but if there was if you ask
33:23 - the question early on you may want to
33:25 - put it in there again because I I can't
33:28 - see it
34:27 - haha okay Savior at some point says his
34:32 - face in the thumbnail looks like mine
34:34 - when I'm coding so yeah I have a
34:35 - confused thumbnail for the video I
34:41 - thought it just it looked funny I
34:43 - thought I'd put it in here
35:03 - all right and I said I like your stream
35:07 - Thanks
35:08 - it's good to see you in the light yet I
35:10 - haven't seen in the chat for a few days
35:12 - so welcome back
35:16 - okay Harsha says I found a site named
35:19 - vulture the ultr
35:21 - it's it's like digital ocean about
35:24 - offers double resources for the same
35:26 - amount of money oh that's cool I have to
35:30 - check that out thank you all right Kat
35:37 - des how long since you've learned coding
35:42 - I've been I guess seriously doing
35:45 - JavaScript for about three years now
35:47 - in terms of just building websites it's
35:50 - been about five years I first learned
35:53 - about building websites and when I was
35:56 - in high school so somewhere around the
35:58 - year 2003 I think and then I did some
36:04 - stuff in college just like some C++ just
36:10 - really basic like I built a calculator
36:12 - in C++ so nothing nothing too crazy and
36:17 - then I didn't really work that much with
36:19 - coding you know until till about five
36:25 - years ago so if you want to know more I
36:29 - have a video on my channel it's linked
36:31 - in the description to this video and I
36:34 - think the video is called my was a how I
36:39 - became a front-end developer so you can
36:42 - check that out if you want a little bit
36:43 - more in-depth explanation
36:52 - Albert asks what application I'm doing
36:55 - basically we're doing a react app and
36:58 - it's a it's it's a university bulletin
37:02 - so it's gonna have a login system and
37:04 - then once you log in you'll be able to
37:06 - see a lot of different announcements
37:10 - download attachments submit your own
37:14 - announcements link what else yeah that's
37:18 - pretty much it that's that's what it's
37:19 - going to do cat DZ's three-hour meeting
37:29 - sounds too long yeah well it was
37:32 - actually two different meetings so the
37:34 - first meeting was about an hour long and
37:35 - then the second meeting which I thought
37:37 - was only going to be a few minutes ended
37:39 - up being almost two hours so yeah then
37:43 - he'll be being long long time okay
38:00 - and I'm the worst part of the whole
38:02 - thing about all the meetings I'm super
38:04 - hungry I thought I'd have time to eat
38:06 - before I stream but I didn't so what my
38:10 - stomach is killing me all right let's
38:15 - see I'm gonna go back and do some more
38:17 - coding let's um all right here's what
38:20 - I'm gonna do and I'll give you my reason
38:24 - as well I really like password this it
38:28 - looks good but I'm not gonna use it for
38:30 - this stream because I put in my tweet
38:33 - about the stream and in the title for
38:35 - this dream that I would be using
38:37 - Passport so since I can't decide between
38:40 - the two of them I'm just gonna use that
38:42 - as my deciding factor I mean there's
38:45 - also the benefit that I'm probably going
38:48 - to switch up and implement some of the
38:50 - other passport solutions as well so I
38:52 - think that does give me a little bit
38:54 - more freedom that I could potentially
38:56 - implement multiple solutions from
38:58 - passport if I wanted to at some point so
39:02 - that's what I'm gonna go with that I
39:04 - appreciate all the suggestions from
39:06 - everyone and I I may use them like you
39:10 - know I might end up using password lists
39:12 - in a future project or who knows maybe
39:14 - this project if this doesn't work out
39:17 - but at this point I need to make a
39:19 - decision so we can get something done
39:22 - all right so let's go ahead and
39:39 - let's see what we need to do so I assume
39:48 - we're going to have to use ha ha to load
39:51 - up passport first and it looks like
40:00 - we're using Redis
40:10 - okay I want to check this out and see if
40:12 - they're bringing in
40:25 - all right that's interesting
40:47 - okay I may have just changed my mind yes
40:53 - sorry sorry for being so indecisive but
40:56 - now that I took a closer look at this
41:04 - I'm not so sure that this will be the
41:07 - easier way of the two because it seems
41:11 - like and correct me if I'm wrong I've
41:14 - never worked with with Redis but it does
41:18 - not look like it's built into this
41:23 - package or the passport package which
41:28 - means I'll have to install that
41:30 - separately and figure out how to use it
41:34 - I'm not really I'm not really looking
41:39 - forward to trying to do that on the
41:42 - stream in the next 20 minutes where did
41:46 - I put this
41:56 - now
42:01 - let's see
42:17 - yeah okay maybe we will go with the
42:20 - other module I was just checking the
42:21 - live chat as well it looks like you are
42:23 - noticing some some additional things
42:52 - okay all right let's go with this one
43:02 - it it includes some setup for things
43:07 - that this one does not I would say this
43:11 - assumes some knowledge of other things
43:13 - that I don't have and this one is more
43:15 - explicit about talking through the steps
43:18 - so I think we have a better shot of
43:20 - getting this one up and running faster
43:24 - than the other one so apologies for the
43:27 - misleading title I can always go back
43:29 - and change that and I think I probably
43:31 - will after this stream but I think we're
43:35 - gonna end up going with this pasture
43:37 - list so let's bring the terminal up
43:40 - because we need to install some modules
43:44 - okay
43:56 - okay let's see let's go with yarn add
44:04 - password this and we need also need to
44:09 - add password Liz store and
44:21 - this example saying email to use email
44:26 - je s but I thought somewhere else that
44:29 - said that you could use SendGrid
44:34 - yeah I think on their their main hum
44:37 - they just said that you could do you
44:39 - send grade with it
44:51 - hmm
45:12 - I have accounts for both let's just do
45:16 - let's do email js4 now because that'll
45:20 - probably be it'll go along better with
45:24 - the diffusion my princess it'll go along
45:33 - better with their instructions right now
45:35 - on the repo and I don't think we've set
45:37 - up email j/s before on the stream so if
45:40 - we went with sangria it would just be a
45:42 - repeat of what we had done for the last
45:44 - project so we'll go with email j/s just
45:46 - to switch it up a bit okay
45:58 - and we're gonna need to all right we'll
46:08 - let that do its thing
46:09 - and then now in our if we should do this
46:16 - in our app Jess or if we should use
46:19 - another file I'm not sure
46:46 - yeah let's see how we have this maybe we
46:49 - could and this uh
47:22 - okay sorry for all the silence I'm
47:26 - reading through the documentation and
47:41 - and the documentation is very thorough
47:45 - but to get this set up right now I think
47:52 - would be better to take a look at their
47:55 - fully functional example and copy that
48:01 - just to get things going a little bit
48:03 - more quickly so let's work this in here
48:09 - we need to all right let me see what we
48:16 - have alright we have body parts or
48:17 - Express obviously
48:31 - I won't really need some more stuff that
48:33 - we it's not mentioned that's interesting
49:06 - all right so basically the example that
49:10 - they've given the example project has a
49:12 - lot more going on than what they show in
49:16 - the in the documentation so I was hoping
49:21 - the example would would let us get
49:23 - started quickly but now I'm not so sure
49:44 - alright well let's just get started and
49:46 - get as much done as we can I always
49:47 - intended this to be more than one part I
49:50 - figured it would be a two or three part
49:53 - with with multiple streams so let's do
49:57 - that so let's just require these things
49:59 - that that we need so let's bring in
50:05 - these let me change this to Const okay
50:13 - so we brought in we've already let's see
50:16 - yeah we did successfully pull in
50:19 - password this password this store
50:21 - an email je s and now we're gonna bring
50:32 - in let's bring this and
50:42 - change this to cost so if you want to
50:45 - follow along with where I'm at I'm on
50:51 - that password list github repository I'm
50:59 - gonna put the link there in the live
51:00 - chat and I want to step 3 well I just
51:04 - finished step 3 well I'm just going to
51:07 - get all the code in for now we'll fill
51:08 - in our details later on I got a I'll
51:12 - bring up on my other screen my email j/s
51:15 - account and get the info that I need so
51:21 - now we're on step 4
51:50 - oops wrong screen okay here we go so I'm
51:58 - gonna make a mess of this app dot J's
52:00 - file right now we can always refactor
52:03 - this and separate it out later on but
52:09 - just to move a little bit faster for the
52:12 - stream I'm not gonna worry about that
52:14 - for right now
52:24 - so basically we've for this step we are
52:31 - initializing password lists with this
52:35 - store all right and now we're gonna set
52:45 - up our token delivery
52:52 - so all these semicolons are killing me
52:59 - all right
53:04 - so assuming that we're gonna go with
53:06 - email J s this is how it's recommended
53:09 - to set this up which at least for now to
53:16 - test it out we are going to use email J
53:18 - us I might switch it up to send grid at
53:21 - some point and then now we're on step
53:26 - six we're gonna set up the middleware
53:40 - okay I'm going through this pretty
53:42 - quickly but if you want to learn more
53:45 - about what's going on you can read all
53:47 - the details that are there for each of
53:51 - these steps
54:15 - let's make sure we've setup
55:06 - all right we need to I was just
55:10 - double-checking to see if we've said
55:12 - we've done this next step at some point
55:14 - I'm one that steps seven
55:35 - okay
55:39 - let's see oh yeah hard should sing
55:41 - always use node mailer I I'm using email
55:45 - je s in this case because it's that's
55:48 - what they're using for these docs so -
55:50 - let me get it set up more quickly we can
55:53 - always switch up to node mailer you know
55:57 - after we get this going
56:11 - okay
56:26 - okay so we don't have this one right now
56:46 - all right so place it we're on step 7
56:49 - for the routers so let's just copy this
56:54 - in so at this point I'm copy and pasting
57:00 - a lot from the from the documentation
57:04 - once we get it all in there we can give
57:06 - it a you know give it a test then we can
57:08 - go in there and change things if we need
57:10 - to yeah
57:30 - all right and it says in the
57:32 - documentation that we want to make sure
57:34 - using bawdy parser which we are I
57:36 - believe we already have great we already
57:38 - have that fixed list of users okay we're
57:44 - skipping over that second part of step
57:47 - seven because we don't in fact have a
57:50 - fixed list of users so skip that over
57:54 - okay now it has some code for a login
57:57 - page I'm obviously not going to use that
58:00 - for our login page because we're using
58:03 - react so I'm not just going to copy in
58:05 - that that HTML but we can do this in
58:09 - react quickly let me check my time and
58:11 - see what's down there not that much time
58:14 - okay so we just need to make a very
58:17 - basic basic form and let's see
58:32 - so let's make that basic form we just
58:34 - need to send it to the sent oaken path
58:39 - and it looks like it just needs one
58:43 - field I think we just need to just need
58:46 - to send one one field which will be user
58:49 - which in this case we're going to use
58:55 - email
59:18 - okay Harshit saying there's something up
59:20 - with the code so it's not gonna work
59:22 - okay he said I Jesse I don't think I
59:28 - think you don't so much backend stuff
59:31 - yeah yeah that's true I'm a front-end
59:34 - developer that does back in when I have
59:37 - to we don't have a back-end developer
59:41 - here in in my department so I do what I
59:46 - can
59:50 - let's see so I'm trying to see where
60:02 - okay so let's a dragon owner says but
60:05 - you already have a transport that you
60:07 - require on top
60:15 - okay let me check that out so
60:45 - okay yeah I'm not sure where we're
60:48 - trying to figure out where the issue is
60:52 - but I'm not sure
61:00 - okay cat D says if you're using
61:02 - WordPress isn't there an auth module
61:04 - that you can use yes so that basically
61:12 - there's going to be at least in my mind
61:14 - there's gonna have to be two two parts
61:21 - so since the wordpress is is like a
61:25 - separate kind of issue like the first
61:28 - thing is we want to have users
61:31 - authenticated to be able to even access
61:33 - anything within the react portion of it
61:36 - and then our server is going to make
61:40 - calls to the WordPress installation at
61:44 - that point there needs to be something
61:46 - basically something that make sure that
61:49 - the WordPress data can only be accessed
61:53 - by someone who's authorized so
61:58 - essentially we don't need every user to
62:01 - be able to directly access WordPress we
62:05 - need but we do need every user to be
62:07 - able to authenticate to access that
62:09 - react part of it so maybe there's a
62:14 - better way to set it up but I I don't
62:17 - know that it would simplify things to
62:20 - have the authentication kind of pass all
62:22 - the way through to WordPress but that is
62:25 - gonna have to be a part of it at some
62:27 - point but as far as I think not
62:30 - necessarily for the user yeah okay so
62:35 - harsh it has it so I should saying you
62:36 - you're required to authenticate
62:38 - WordPress on the server only yeah so
62:40 - basically the server on the react side
62:43 - of things has to be able to make
62:46 - requests to WordPress but not
62:48 - necessarily the user right from the
62:50 - client side
62:56 - alright let's see I mean
63:02 - [Music]
63:07 - alright work says saying you mean it
63:10 - won't work because of the res render he
63:14 - can switch it to res send for testing no
63:17 - an email JS file okay alright that's why
63:24 - I'm not seeing it so it looks like car
63:25 - should saying that the problem was in
63:30 - the email Jas file okay yeah I'm not
63:47 - okay cool oh it looks like harsh it's
63:49 - making a PR right now so depending on
63:51 - how long that takes we may be able to
63:53 - just pull some stuff in so yeah
63:55 - definitely you all can see how much like
63:58 - difficulty I'm having because well
64:01 - number one I'm not a back-end guy number
64:02 - two this is really all harsh it's work I
64:05 - haven't done anything with the server
64:08 - dot or the app dot J's file for the
64:10 - server so I'm not I'm not familiar with
64:15 - how it's set up I certainly reviewed
64:16 - everything before I pulled it in but I
64:21 - mean you know how it is if you write it
64:24 - yourself you're way more familiar with
64:27 - it then if you're trying to add to
64:28 - someone else's code which is the
64:30 - position I'm in right now so thank you
64:32 - for all the help
64:33 - Harshit and everybody else that's that's
64:36 - adding in a little okay eric says would
64:40 - love to see a flow chart for your
64:42 - authentication on this project that's a
64:44 - great idea I should try to come up with
64:46 - something for that because I have a
64:48 - visual in my head of of the flow but it
64:52 - might be a lot better if I could try to
64:54 - put that in some sort of like visual
64:59 - format for you all okay cool john b
65:08 - spotted a typo let's um let me wait i'm
65:12 - not going to change it right now i'm
65:13 - gonna wait and see what's up with with
65:15 - harsh its next pool request and then
65:19 - i'll change it
65:23 - ours was also asking did the male male
65:27 - trap work i know i didn't have a chance
65:30 - to to get it working before i so i just
65:34 - had to come straight for the meetings
65:35 - and started the stream so i didn't get a
65:38 - chance to even test it out aside from
65:40 - like the very first test i did that did
65:42 - not work
65:48 - see I can give it a shot I currently
65:54 - have have the info let me make sure that
66:00 - I have a
66:20 - there we go I'm gonna I don't want to
66:22 - show everybody my my dot m-files so I'm
66:27 - moving it to my other screen and I'm
66:29 - gonna open it up there just to make sure
66:31 - that I have okay I do have the right
66:34 - stuff in there actually I did I changed
66:45 - my password and username so let me
66:48 - update that
67:01 - okay say that whoops let's make sure
67:25 - I lost my whoa
67:33 - oh I know why cuz I just messed it up
67:36 - with all this obviously I just added a
67:40 - bunch of stuff alright so I'm gonna
67:42 - remove the stuff that I just did because
67:45 - we have a pull request that is on its
67:48 - way I need to get this working at least
67:57 - see and I'm not that worried about
68:01 - getting rid of this because
68:02 - realistically I just copy and paste and
68:04 - some stuff I didn't even make any
68:05 - modifications so it'll take about three
68:09 - minutes to get all that stuff back in
68:11 - there again if I need to let's see that
68:20 - was everything right yeah
68:26 - let's just give it a little restart here
68:29 - see if that fixes things yep
68:35 - there we go
68:39 - I'm gonna try to submit an announcements
68:43 - whoa
68:50 - that's it no that's probably not gonna
68:56 - work because if it was going to work it
68:58 - would have worked already
69:25 - okay my timer did go up so let me do
69:28 - another five minutes on my news okay let
69:32 - me do another five minutes and let me go
69:37 - back up to where I left off three or
69:38 - four
69:58 - okay our arvind says is the initial
70:01 - setup done yeah the the setup for this
70:05 - project it's done if if you go back and
70:08 - watch some of the previous streams
70:10 - you'll be able to check out the initial
70:12 - setup so this is project force if you go
70:15 - back to project for day one then that'll
70:19 - be you know obviously the starting point
70:22 - Sebastian says don't you need a database
70:24 - to store data with Passport
70:28 - yes I would assume
70:30 - I think that's or that we were bringing
70:35 - in that store
71:25 - okay cool Gideon's watching so glad you
71:33 - could join us
71:34 - gideon says so late once hin don't worry
71:38 - about it I was late to my own stream
72:06 - zavier says just use the honor system
72:08 - for us yeah
72:11 - why don't I just make one password and
72:14 - then I'll just email that pass for it to
72:16 - everybody at the University and then
72:19 - it'll be easy right it will just it
72:23 - would just be really basic we'll just
72:26 - have like user name user 1 and password
72:33 - 1 2 3 4 right obvious that change it
72:37 - because I just told you that password so
72:39 - that could work I actually believe it or
72:45 - not I've seen systems like that where we
72:47 - have something that's password protected
72:49 - but literally the the password is shared
72:52 - with everyone that works at the
72:53 - University
73:15 - okay so a few you're talking about using
73:19 - JWT JSON web tokens so rang Shu says
73:24 - JSON web tokens could work with just
73:27 - email just validate the email for a
73:29 - valid one as they says is there a reason
73:32 - you don't want to use JSON web tokens
73:35 - since the university has an email
73:36 - address send the link to the email and
73:39 - that should do the job I guess so
73:49 - let me think don't you think
74:02 - okay so let me sink through and you all
74:06 - know I'm no expert on JSON web tokens
74:08 - and how to set that up so you all if
74:10 - you've used them help me out here
74:12 - so the flow for the user then would be
74:17 - they go to the site for the first time
74:20 - they put in their email address we send
74:22 - them an email then they would click the
74:28 - link in that email then that would take
74:31 - them that that would basically have the
74:33 - token that would validate them at that
74:37 - point we would then have to store we
74:46 - would have to store that data for that
74:47 - user and then if I want to keep them
74:51 - login we'd have to store in local
74:54 - storage or as a cookie or whatever some
74:58 - data for that user in their own browser
74:59 - and then when they try to come back we
75:03 - check for that is that correct is that
75:05 - how the flow should work and if so would
75:15 - it be easier to just implement something
75:17 - very simple like that on our own or
75:19 - should we use one of these other
75:21 - solutions arvind says i think you should
75:29 - consider using the mapping of the email
75:31 - with phone number if it ever be
75:33 - necessary to send SMS considering this
75:41 - we can proceed with password list i
75:43 - guess can we start now please yeah yeah
75:47 - with the SMS maybe we can have the
75:50 - option for users to link it to their
75:54 - phone number and then then I guess later
75:58 - on if they need to log back in they
76:00 - could choose to get a text instead of an
76:02 - email that it might actually be
76:13 - yeah that might actually be a nicer
76:17 - option for people who are trying to use
76:19 - their cell phone
77:18 - okay
77:26 - okay so it looks like in regard to the
77:39 - JSON web tokens that may end up being
77:42 - the simplest way to do it but we'll see
77:45 - because harsh it's working on this pool
77:48 - request so maybe I should see about that
77:51 - first
78:01 - okay let's see um so I guess I don't
78:10 - know that I want to I don't want to put
78:12 - pressure on Harsha to try to push
78:14 - something out this quickly so I don't
78:17 - know if we should wait for that probably
78:20 - not
78:41 - all right so you let me let me just go
78:44 - ahead three I know the timer went up but
78:45 - let me just finish up with all the
78:47 - questions in the live chat here and then
78:51 - we'll see if I finish up the questions
78:52 - and we have something from a pull
78:55 - request maybe we'll check it out
78:56 - otherwise maybe we'll just have to
78:58 - postpone and work on this so yeah so
79:03 - sorry I didn't really get that much
79:04 - accomplished but we did sift through a
79:07 - lot of options and got a lot of
79:09 - different ideas on what would be the
79:10 - best way to do this so it's it's not it
79:13 - was productive in that sense I did think
79:20 - I'd have more time beforehand to get
79:22 - some things ready so it just didn't
79:25 - happen
79:37 - oops
80:02 - oh cool Blake says hey Jesse has
80:06 - submitted a pull request on the free
80:08 - code camp guides can you check it out to
80:10 - see if it reads whoa and it's helpful
80:12 - link okay cool off to check that out
80:15 - not right now but maybe after the stream
80:18 - I could check it out I just saw this
80:30 - some hard
80:31 - he says the the passport module so the
80:34 - passport password list repo says it
80:39 - looks kind of it looks hacky he's they
80:41 - are using password lists internally
80:50 - that's crazy
81:17 - arvin says i think we have only harsh
81:21 -  in the house who knows password
81:23 - this better than any we should listen to
81:25 - him he may got yeah yeah it does seem
81:27 - like harsh it has some experience with
81:30 - using password list
81:40 - okay cool dragon hunter unfortunately I
81:45 - didn't catch all this earlier when I was
81:47 - when I was actually doing some coding
81:49 - the dragon owner said we already said
81:52 - you already have note mailers set up you
81:54 - can use that transport yeah that makes a
81:57 - lot of sense we were already using it
82:00 - for the other emails so in our email Jas
82:05 - we're already bringing in node mailer so
82:11 - could've used that like I said my
82:14 - intention was to set everything up
82:17 - exactly like it was in the documentation
82:19 - for password list thinking that that
82:22 - would allow us to at least have
82:24 - something to test out as quickly as
82:27 - possible
82:29 - yeah buh buh Jen says boy that is a mess
82:36 - of code James says high school in 2003
82:47 - I'm about to show my age high school for
82:49 - me was 94 computers we're not even a
82:52 - consideration when I was going to school
83:06 - and Brett says I'm Way older than James
83:09 - it's always interesting I wonder what
83:11 - age range we have in here I know we've
83:13 - had I'm pretty sure we've had people who
83:16 - are like less than 10 years old I can't
83:20 - remember the exact age but we had some
83:21 - people that are really young and I think
83:23 - we've had people in their 60s on the
83:26 - stream I think it's cool that we have
83:28 - such a big age range and a range of
83:32 - people from different locations around
83:35 - the world that's that's awesome that we
83:37 - all kind of work together you know on
83:41 - these projects
84:10 - Kaddi says TGIF thank goodness it's
84:14 - Friday yeah
84:42 - okay dragon hunter says why not an
84:45 - authentication micro service which will
84:47 - route East request a separate one
85:00 - I don't I don't know enough about it to
85:02 - know whether or not which one would be
85:05 - better which one wouldn't be better ok
85:15 - Umberto says when using Microsoft sequel
85:18 - we make a service account for the server
85:22 - machine to the database ok cool that's
85:25 - that's kind of what I was thinking we'd
85:26 - end up doing with the the WordPress is
85:29 - that we would have a user account on
85:35 - WordPress that would just basically just
85:38 - be for our server to connect to
85:42 - WordPress so I'm glad to hear that
85:45 - that's that's how it's done
85:47 - in other places as well because I mean
85:49 - it seemed like it would work to me but I
85:50 - wasn't sure that that would be you know
85:52 - the proper way to do it
86:05 - Ellen Umberto says and the application
86:07 - controls what date of the login an
86:09 - authenticated user sees yeah definitely
86:11 - that's that's how I was thinking that
86:12 - that it would work so so I'm not crazy
86:16 - that's the legit way Haven
86:45 - okay I'm getting towards the bottom of
86:47 - the live chat it's gonna check see if
86:49 - there's any more questions
87:25 - okay we got so Arvin says okay I might
87:28 - be a noob but don't worry about being a
87:31 - noob I knew that many things as well but
87:37 - says it might be a new but I just want
87:40 - to know how to make multiple single page
87:42 - applications and a website what I
87:44 - basically mean is I should be able to do
87:46 - single page application stuff in
87:48 - multiple pages in the website what I'm
87:53 - basically confused about is how do you
87:54 - segregate multiple modules and
87:57 - associated controllers and factories
88:04 - okay
88:17 - well I mean so you want to have a
88:21 - website to where different routes in the
88:24 - site
88:25 - so I guess different sub directories
88:28 - would be their own single page
88:29 - applications that's what that's what I'm
88:32 - getting from this if that's not what
88:34 - you're saying then please let me know
88:46 - I mean I guess as long as you have
88:48 - something that's sitting in front of
88:50 - your multiple single page applications
88:54 - that's routing it to the different ones
88:57 - I mean you could you could separate them
89:02 - out like that so I'm not I guess it's
89:04 - hard to it's hard for me to say without
89:06 - kind of seeing more like what do you
89:08 - what you're trying to do but whatever a
89:11 - routing system that you have just have
89:15 - the the various routes go to different
89:21 - different applications some thinking
89:25 - like usually
89:35 - I mean potentially depending on what you
89:39 - are using you could have so you can have
89:44 - it set up so that all right so usually
89:48 - how we set up our projects when we're
89:51 - using react and note is we have nginx as
89:54 - a reverse proxy potentially we could at
89:56 - that level of the of nginx route traffic
90:01 - to different node installations
90:04 - different react apps based on the URL so
90:09 - I mean you could do something like that
90:11 - or at the level of node and Express you
90:16 - could route things to different places
90:18 - you know at that point I'm just not
90:21 - exactly sure you know which you what
90:24 - you're kind of looking for in terms of
90:27 - how it's going to function I don't know
90:29 - maybe I'm misunderstanding things if
90:31 - anyone else has some some more
90:36 - information and I'll check down here it
90:38 - looks like alright it looks like you got
90:41 - some more info here
90:46 - okay so Arvind is saying I'm basically
90:50 - using angular 1 running it and it uses
90:55 - the controller and factory concept to
90:57 - send receive data into my view let's say
91:00 - I have five pages in my web app and all
91:02 - our single page applications meaning
91:05 - every page has say for routing so
91:08 - collectively there are 20 routes as a
91:10 - whole how do people manage to separate
91:13 - modules for each page oh okay I I have
91:18 - very very little experience with angular
91:20 - so I don't know that I'm the best person
91:22 - to to handle that question if we have
91:26 - any angular people let's see okay so
91:33 - dragon hunter seems to have some answers
91:35 - here so saying if it's the same app that
91:39 - routing is handled by the client app if
91:41 - it's for multiple apps you can use Doku
91:45 - which I've never used that
91:50 - and since in each app could be in a
91:52 - sub-domain
91:52 - yeah definitely let's see okay
92:06 - okay cool so thanks dragon owner for for
92:09 - those answers yeah I'm definitely not
92:12 - I'm not very knowledgeable about angular
92:14 - stuff so I'll definitely admit when I
92:19 - don't have enough in all this to answer
92:21 - question properly
92:42 - okay we have some some ages here so
92:45 - seventeen twenty four thirty five thirty
92:49 - twenty six twenty I'm 31 I actually be
92:54 - 32 next week what's today I'll be 32
92:58 - that on the 29th of October so soon
93:14 - okay harsh it says the PR is almost done
93:26 - uh-huh Paco says you know the last
93:29 - commit from angular was in 1886 they are
93:33 - still debugging the code at Google I
93:39 - don't want to get into any JavaScript
93:42 - framework Wars here John B says I
93:47 - believe you mean 1861 Paco that's when
93:50 - the great angular Civil War started when
93:53 - angular 2 changed the routing macho
94:05 - this is in react sitting looking at at
94:08 - angular analyst version with a big smile
94:15 - eric says angularjs plus one still
94:18 - learning more about react but it looks
94:20 - really great MD says hi hey how's it
94:30 - going thanks for joining us
94:32 - oh cool Blake said I'll be 15 in a month
94:37 - awesome actually Blake you might be the
94:39 - youngest one in the stream so cool
94:43 - awesome
94:59 - okay let me I think
95:11 - rat the bottom
95:22 - all right I'm at the bottom of the live
95:23 - chat I've gotten through everything so I
95:27 - know our shits pretty close to finishing
95:29 - up this pull request but I'm not sure
95:32 - not streaming away around for it maybe
95:36 - if I had eaten something today I might
95:38 - wait around for it but huh I'm really
95:41 - hungry so I'm right in the stream let's
95:46 - see let's say there's still some
95:47 - conversation going on here in the live
95:49 - stream but no no questions so yeah so I
95:54 - think there's definitely going to be a
95:55 - part two to the authentication and maybe
96:00 - down the road even a part three if we
96:02 - end up switching to something else so
96:07 - alright so my my energy level is is low
96:15 - so I probably wouldn't be very
96:17 - productive if I even try to do anything
96:19 - at this point so dragon owners to start
96:30 - a little Express project let's try
96:31 - password list I can't I don't have I'm I
96:36 - don't have the energy right now so yeah
96:41 - alright so it's Friday right so I'll be
96:44 - back Monday have a great day yeah so
96:50 - sorry didn't didn't really accomplish
96:53 - anything but we'll give it another go on
96:57 - Monday probably harsh it'll have some
96:59 - code for us to review and you know if
97:04 - anyone else has any ideas for you know
97:07 - what to do for authentication you know
97:08 - I'm still open to that as well it's very
97:12 - much still you know up for for
97:15 - discussion so I'll be back next week
97:19 - have a great weekend everybody and
97:22 - thanks for watching

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse I'm so sorry about starting this late I can see you've all been busy in the live chat so hopefully there was some good conversation going on I have not had a chance to read any of this so I'm scrolling through it now all right so I was as supposed to have a very brief conversation and it turned into a almost twohour meeting so that's why I started late I thought I would have plenty of time to get started or to get ready for the stream and stream but it didn't happen like that so I guess as a as asking how the meetings were actually the meetings they there are basically about all the projects that we're going to be doing for the next year I shouldn't say all of them I'm sure some other things will come up but I have a much better idea about what I'll be working on and how that that main website so mentioned a few days ago the main University website franciscan CD you will be completely redoing that front end and back end I have a much better a clearer picture of what's wanted for that and what's what the design is going to be like so I'll be sharing that with you in future streams but I know I have we sketched out some things on a whiteboard and I took a picture of it so I wouldn't forget so I'll be will be working on it but it was a long but it did we sorted quite a few things out one thing that we are going to be working on within the next two weeks or so and we'll see maybe I'll do it on a stream maybe I won't it depends on if you are interested we're going to try to take so the main website right now has an event system that's really hard to to work with in terms of adding the content for the events so we're going to take I may as well give you something to look at what we're talking about this to you all right so what we're gonna do not in this stream but in the next week or so we're gonna redo the events so that we'll use some thirdparty systems so here's here's right now how the events show up and there are other places throughout the website that these events show up for now I think we'll just worry about this spot but we're going to remove all of this and replace it and instead we're going to pool events from some other systems so it may be a Google Calendar it might be Eventbrite it may be a custom post type from WordPress installation however so someone else in my department is in charge of entering in the data for these events whatever they decide is going to be the best system for them that's going to you save them as much time as possible we're going to work with that system so I don't know what it'll be right up you know right away but it's going to be something that definitely it has to have an API so we're going to replace all of this with whatever that system is that's going to hopefully free up some time for this other person and they're gonna learn react they're actually going to do a clone of our project one the the cata catechol Institute website they're going to do a clone of that and they're going to use that for another University website and in the process hopefully they're going to learn react so if somebody else in department that can can do react sites so that's right so my job in the next week or two is to free up their time by making this event system a lot easier to work with so that's coming if you're interested in that then let me know I'll try to stream when we do that so let me know we'll see I'm still undecided as to whether it's it'll be worth it to stream okay so today I don't know what did I say we're gonna do today Passport yeah passport j/s okay I'm just briefly checking the live chat see if there's anything I should address right away before we get started okay I'll probably be probably missing a lot of things since I'm skimming through so quickly but it looks okay it doesn't look like there's is anything here okay so here's what I'm going to do I'm gonna start my 25minute Pomodoro timer if you've asked the question I will get to it after we do our first coding session of 25 minutes so I'll take a fiveminute break and then I'll start going through questions no matter what at the end of the stream I'll go through all the questions so please don't feel like you're being ignored if I haven't answered your question yet I'm just gonna break it up a little bit and get to the questions a little bit later so hang in there and I will try to answer your question at first here's what I think we're going to do Harshit has added a pull request that did a lot of work to the server so before we try to implement anything with passport j/s on the server we're better off merging that in I think that'll be much easier to handle to do it that way instead of trying to handle all the merge conflicts that will happen so I've already pulled down I'm gonna doublecheck and make sure that nothing's been added to his pull request but otherwise earlier I've already pulled it down as a separate branch so it shouldn't be that hard to just merge it in right from the command line so on my other screen I have this pull request open I'm just verifying that the last commit let's see the last commit was okay so there has not it looks like there has not been another commit since the last time I pulled everything down so that's great okay so let me bring this over then see all can see it so I was about to do it anyway okay so briefly give this a look and let's see so you can see we have some extra things here we're doing you know webbing emailed ojs file that's handling sending the emails from our form also attachments the app touch as file in the end the server has a lot of extra stuff in there too using a motor to handle form data we have fetch working in here so we have some stuff set up I can't remember how much of this was from a previous pull request and how much was this this last one so maybe going over some stuff that we've already seen but I had a little bit of trouble getting things to work I don't think it had anything to do with with any of the code I think it had something to do with me setting up an account to handle the mail so I'm gonna go ahead and pull this in but if if you happen to clone this repository and it doesn't work for you when you try to submit the form I'm aware that something's wrong with the way I'm doing it so as soon as I figure that out then I'll let you know I wasn't harsh it had given me some suggestions for how to troubleshoot that but I've been in meetings for three hours straight so I have not been able to even attempt to to troubleshoot so tell you I had an issue but I just really didn't have time to try to fix it so I'm not that worried about it let's see all right let's merge this in so just I'm just going to double check and make sure I don't have anything in master that should have been merged okay great we're up to date I'm gonna go back to the master branch and I'm gonna run a git merge and I'm gonna merge in this branch which contains all the work that Harsha did and merge it into master there we go I'm just I think I already brought everything in in terms of the packages but I'm gonna run your own again just to be sure yep we're good so make sure that you do that if you bring in this this latest code locally to your machine be sure to run an NPM install or yarn because there's quite a few packages that that have been added okay great so now that we have that in there we can get to work on actually let me push that up there we go just want to make sure make sure that I push that so in case you all want to get the latest the latest code pulled down on your machines you have it now and see let me bring over let's see I'm John I have a lot of stuff open a lot of windows on my other screen so I'm just a little little clutter and I didn't have a chance to unclutter things before the stream okay here it is alright so let me bring this over this is the github repo for passport j/s which is what we're going to be using so you can check that out if you like um actually I'll paste in the live chat the link and that way you can you can go right there if you want to look at it and also here's the link to the main site and to the docs so we'll be going off looking at these docs I know this is really small I'll zoom in a bit but this is the passport Jay s dot work site so here's what we need to do though the way at least from what I've read so far the way passport UAS works is that there are a lot of these extra modules that you can use depending on what kind of authentication you want so we need to we need to come to a decision about what do we want what we want to do with authentication and I'm not I have an idea what I want to do but I'm not a hundred percent sure so I'm gonna run some things by you all and and see what what you think and if anyone has any input so currently let's see currently we at the university use for all the accounts I believe it's it's Active Directory and right now the single signon system that all the other university stuff is tied into but not the bulletin that we're working on I think is using I'm gonna say sam'l it's saml I'm not really sure how people say that normally I've only ever read it but I don't currently have all the information I need to implement that system I think the best case scenario would be to get on that same system and then all user accounts will be handled by the IT department which which would be really nice so it would all be one system and I I think that would be what's best for the users and then that would be what's best for me as well and not having to continually perform you know maintenance tasks to make sure everybody can log in and handle support calls about login issues which is fine but that's not really what my position is supposed to do I'd much rather spend time building new things so I'm not sure how on board IT is with sharing the information I need to bring that into the system I'll need to do some more work in terms of talking to people before I can get to that point so I'm wondering if I should just go ahead and implement all the code and assume that I'm going to get the information that I need it sometime in the next few days I mean meaning like next week or should we try to use some other type of basic system assuming that maybe we be able to tie in the university system and so we'll have to do something else on our own I'm not sure so basically the choices as I see it is start building it out to use sam'l hoping that we get the other information we need from the IT department to finish that at some point next week or do we just pick a different system for users to be able to log in and implement that and then if we eventually get information for an IT we can switch over to something else but for now we we could do something different so if anybody has any opinions on that let me know I'm gonna give it maybe like 30 seconds a minute just to get some feedback otherwise I'm just gonna have to flip a coin or something I'm have to figure it out I guess if you need some more info on what I need to do is basically what I need is only people who work for the university should be able to login I don't have access to a list of all the people that work for the University the best I have is that somebody who has a university email and if I could verify that they actually have access to that email by sending an email link that's the only way that I can do this at this point so whatever I do I need it so that the bulletin is only accessible by people with a Franciscan ddu email address so something like a password this login with an email link is what we're using right now through a different system I want to switch I haven't the system I'm using currently hasn't been a hundred percent reliable so I don't want to do it the exact same way but if we could figure out some way to you an email link password this login that'll work for now and then I guess we get hope that we we can tie it in in a better way later on let's see all right I'm gonna check out the live chat now and see what you all you all think okay okay so we do have password let's log in some of your saying we should do password this at least Sebastian says if it were me I wouldn't even try to do any type of login until you are sure of what you need and what you can use yeah I mean that's not really a bad idea I just I feel like we're getting to the point where I need to start doing something with this because in terms of the project itself we have all the main pieces there we just have a couple more UI things to work out but I think we're getting close to this being you know usable I mean it's certainly you it's currently is usable it's not perfect but it fulfills all the requirements that we need right now at this point and the last requirement left is to make sure that its users have to be authenticated to access this this site so that's why I just want to kind of move on with it one way or another okay okay was umberto says that's how I implemented our HR web portal in register screen active directory pool email address there were no user entry allowed interesting okay cool harsh it actually has a link to a passport password list great you know what I thought there was a password list module I was looking for it yesterday but I couldn't find it in their list of modules on their on their website there's like 300 models on their website though and I was just scanning through so I I probably just missed it let's see but I was pretty sure that I had seen the password list login system used with passport before in a tutorial that I saw probably months ago let's see okay so I see this NPM passport password list do they have a github usually there's a link to the github right there but I don't see it here we go all right so I found it great so found the github repo for this let me pull this over let's check this out and see see if this will work actually I see a lot activity in the live chat too so let's see okay let's see all right let me see I'm Bertos explaining how he set this up so let me go through some of this stuff as well they're just there's just been a lot in the last chat with in the last 30 seconds or so okay so embarrassin saying send a verification email and then add user to identity server or the identity store then the next time they access the system if they are registered it uses a D violin doz login to authenticate and authorize cool I mean that's that's what I really want to do I just don't have I don't really have information or access to what we're currently doing with with a D with Active Directory okay so it looks like Harshit saying there are two different ones here so there's a just password list and then there's a password password this he's recommending to use the one that's just password lists okay as we could check that one out as well hmm hmm okay so I'm looking at this password this as well okay interesting here's now here's another thing to keep in mind I don't know the answer this I'm just I'm asking so right now we're comparing these two different modules one is works with Passport the other one it looks like just works on its own it's it's not tied in with Passport what I hope will happen is at some point we'll switch away from this and will actually be tied in more closely with the single signon system that the university is using if that's the case would it be better now even let's let's assume for a second that this password list is better than passport password this even if that is the case would it be better to just implement this passport password list knowing that we're going to switch to some other passport solution maybe password passport sam'l or something like that I don't know I'm wondering what what opinion you all have on that hmm I actually already have an email Jas account set up so it wouldn't be that hard to put that in hmm okay let's check this one out briefly and let's see okay so it looks like a few you're saying in the live chat here that if I do plan on switching to use sam'l with Passport then maybe I should set it up just to use Passport right now okay that's kind of what I was thinking I wanted I just looked through the passport password lists I just want to take a brief glance at this password list repository just to see if anything stands out that could be a dealbreaker okay hmm okay interesting I I didn't really see anything in either one that makes me really want to choose one or the other I mean I just looking at the documentation this one seems a bit more simple it could be that just it doesn't explain as much in the documentation though so all right let's see all right okay harsh it says we should check out password list dotnet hmm okay just to keep in mind as well I'm gonna throw this up here this is what I was thinking of using passport saml so if anybody's interested in checking that out I'm hoping at some point that we implement this or something like it so I came through the link in as well into the live chat Harshit says you can also send SMS with it it the SMS thing is cool but I can't I can't use the SMS right now because the it has to be the email so I wouldn't I wouldn't be able to use it because the email is the only way I can really make sure that it's somebody that works at the University because they have an active University email account okay let me take a break now and answer some questions we didn't didn't actually get any code worked out but as soon as we as soon as I make a decision we will get some code let's see okay all right Blake Blake says could you link their email to their phone number actually that's interesting that might be possible hmm I'll consider that let's see all right I'm gonna scroll up and try to go through and answer some questions it looks like yeah I don't I don't have everything that was in the live chat so it cut off so if you ask something closer to the very beginning of when the stream was supposed to start I can't see it anymore so I'm sorry about that but if there was if you ask the question early on you may want to put it in there again because I I can't see it haha okay Savior at some point says his face in the thumbnail looks like mine when I'm coding so yeah I have a confused thumbnail for the video I thought it just it looked funny I thought I'd put it in here all right and I said I like your stream Thanks it's good to see you in the light yet I haven't seen in the chat for a few days so welcome back okay Harsha says I found a site named vulture the ultr it's it's like digital ocean about offers double resources for the same amount of money oh that's cool I have to check that out thank you all right Kat des how long since you've learned coding I've been I guess seriously doing JavaScript for about three years now in terms of just building websites it's been about five years I first learned about building websites and when I was in high school so somewhere around the year 2003 I think and then I did some stuff in college just like some C++ just really basic like I built a calculator in C++ so nothing nothing too crazy and then I didn't really work that much with coding you know until till about five years ago so if you want to know more I have a video on my channel it's linked in the description to this video and I think the video is called my was a how I became a frontend developer so you can check that out if you want a little bit more indepth explanation Albert asks what application I'm doing basically we're doing a react app and it's a it's it's a university bulletin so it's gonna have a login system and then once you log in you'll be able to see a lot of different announcements download attachments submit your own announcements link what else yeah that's pretty much it that's that's what it's going to do cat DZ's threehour meeting sounds too long yeah well it was actually two different meetings so the first meeting was about an hour long and then the second meeting which I thought was only going to be a few minutes ended up being almost two hours so yeah then he'll be being long long time okay and I'm the worst part of the whole thing about all the meetings I'm super hungry I thought I'd have time to eat before I stream but I didn't so what my stomach is killing me all right let's see I'm gonna go back and do some more coding let's um all right here's what I'm gonna do and I'll give you my reason as well I really like password this it looks good but I'm not gonna use it for this stream because I put in my tweet about the stream and in the title for this dream that I would be using Passport so since I can't decide between the two of them I'm just gonna use that as my deciding factor I mean there's also the benefit that I'm probably going to switch up and implement some of the other passport solutions as well so I think that does give me a little bit more freedom that I could potentially implement multiple solutions from passport if I wanted to at some point so that's what I'm gonna go with that I appreciate all the suggestions from everyone and I I may use them like you know I might end up using password lists in a future project or who knows maybe this project if this doesn't work out but at this point I need to make a decision so we can get something done all right so let's go ahead and let's see what we need to do so I assume we're going to have to use ha ha to load up passport first and it looks like we're using Redis okay I want to check this out and see if they're bringing in all right that's interesting okay I may have just changed my mind yes sorry sorry for being so indecisive but now that I took a closer look at this I'm not so sure that this will be the easier way of the two because it seems like and correct me if I'm wrong I've never worked with with Redis but it does not look like it's built into this package or the passport package which means I'll have to install that separately and figure out how to use it I'm not really I'm not really looking forward to trying to do that on the stream in the next 20 minutes where did I put this now let's see yeah okay maybe we will go with the other module I was just checking the live chat as well it looks like you are noticing some some additional things okay all right let's go with this one it it includes some setup for things that this one does not I would say this assumes some knowledge of other things that I don't have and this one is more explicit about talking through the steps so I think we have a better shot of getting this one up and running faster than the other one so apologies for the misleading title I can always go back and change that and I think I probably will after this stream but I think we're gonna end up going with this pasture list so let's bring the terminal up because we need to install some modules okay okay let's see let's go with yarn add password this and we need also need to add password Liz store and this example saying email to use email je s but I thought somewhere else that said that you could use SendGrid yeah I think on their their main hum they just said that you could do you send grade with it hmm I have accounts for both let's just do let's do email js4 now because that'll probably be it'll go along better with the diffusion my princess it'll go along better with their instructions right now on the repo and I don't think we've set up email j/s before on the stream so if we went with sangria it would just be a repeat of what we had done for the last project so we'll go with email j/s just to switch it up a bit okay and we're gonna need to all right we'll let that do its thing and then now in our if we should do this in our app Jess or if we should use another file I'm not sure yeah let's see how we have this maybe we could and this uh okay sorry for all the silence I'm reading through the documentation and and the documentation is very thorough but to get this set up right now I think would be better to take a look at their fully functional example and copy that just to get things going a little bit more quickly so let's work this in here we need to all right let me see what we have alright we have body parts or Express obviously I won't really need some more stuff that we it's not mentioned that's interesting all right so basically the example that they've given the example project has a lot more going on than what they show in the in the documentation so I was hoping the example would would let us get started quickly but now I'm not so sure alright well let's just get started and get as much done as we can I always intended this to be more than one part I figured it would be a two or three part with with multiple streams so let's do that so let's just require these things that that we need so let's bring in these let me change this to Const okay so we brought in we've already let's see yeah we did successfully pull in password this password this store an email je s and now we're gonna bring in let's bring this and change this to cost so if you want to follow along with where I'm at I'm on that password list github repository I'm gonna put the link there in the live chat and I want to step 3 well I just finished step 3 well I'm just going to get all the code in for now we'll fill in our details later on I got a I'll bring up on my other screen my email j/s account and get the info that I need so now we're on step 4 oops wrong screen okay here we go so I'm gonna make a mess of this app dot J's file right now we can always refactor this and separate it out later on but just to move a little bit faster for the stream I'm not gonna worry about that for right now so basically we've for this step we are initializing password lists with this store all right and now we're gonna set up our token delivery so all these semicolons are killing me all right so assuming that we're gonna go with email J s this is how it's recommended to set this up which at least for now to test it out we are going to use email J us I might switch it up to send grid at some point and then now we're on step six we're gonna set up the middleware okay I'm going through this pretty quickly but if you want to learn more about what's going on you can read all the details that are there for each of these steps let's make sure we've setup all right we need to I was just doublechecking to see if we've said we've done this next step at some point I'm one that steps seven okay let's see oh yeah hard should sing always use node mailer I I'm using email je s in this case because it's that's what they're using for these docs so let me get it set up more quickly we can always switch up to node mailer you know after we get this going okay okay so we don't have this one right now all right so place it we're on step 7 for the routers so let's just copy this in so at this point I'm copy and pasting a lot from the from the documentation once we get it all in there we can give it a you know give it a test then we can go in there and change things if we need to yeah all right and it says in the documentation that we want to make sure using bawdy parser which we are I believe we already have great we already have that fixed list of users okay we're skipping over that second part of step seven because we don't in fact have a fixed list of users so skip that over okay now it has some code for a login page I'm obviously not going to use that for our login page because we're using react so I'm not just going to copy in that that HTML but we can do this in react quickly let me check my time and see what's down there not that much time okay so we just need to make a very basic basic form and let's see so let's make that basic form we just need to send it to the sent oaken path and it looks like it just needs one field I think we just need to just need to send one one field which will be user which in this case we're going to use email okay Harshit saying there's something up with the code so it's not gonna work okay he said I Jesse I don't think I think you don't so much backend stuff yeah yeah that's true I'm a frontend developer that does back in when I have to we don't have a backend developer here in in my department so I do what I can let's see so I'm trying to see where okay so let's a dragon owner says but you already have a transport that you require on top okay let me check that out so okay yeah I'm not sure where we're trying to figure out where the issue is but I'm not sure okay cat D says if you're using WordPress isn't there an auth module that you can use yes so that basically there's going to be at least in my mind there's gonna have to be two two parts so since the wordpress is is like a separate kind of issue like the first thing is we want to have users authenticated to be able to even access anything within the react portion of it and then our server is going to make calls to the WordPress installation at that point there needs to be something basically something that make sure that the WordPress data can only be accessed by someone who's authorized so essentially we don't need every user to be able to directly access WordPress we need but we do need every user to be able to authenticate to access that react part of it so maybe there's a better way to set it up but I I don't know that it would simplify things to have the authentication kind of pass all the way through to WordPress but that is gonna have to be a part of it at some point but as far as I think not necessarily for the user yeah okay so harsh it has it so I should saying you you're required to authenticate WordPress on the server only yeah so basically the server on the react side of things has to be able to make requests to WordPress but not necessarily the user right from the client side alright let's see I mean alright work says saying you mean it won't work because of the res render he can switch it to res send for testing no an email JS file okay alright that's why I'm not seeing it so it looks like car should saying that the problem was in the email Jas file okay yeah I'm not okay cool oh it looks like harsh it's making a PR right now so depending on how long that takes we may be able to just pull some stuff in so yeah definitely you all can see how much like difficulty I'm having because well number one I'm not a backend guy number two this is really all harsh it's work I haven't done anything with the server dot or the app dot J's file for the server so I'm not I'm not familiar with how it's set up I certainly reviewed everything before I pulled it in but I mean you know how it is if you write it yourself you're way more familiar with it then if you're trying to add to someone else's code which is the position I'm in right now so thank you for all the help Harshit and everybody else that's that's adding in a little okay eric says would love to see a flow chart for your authentication on this project that's a great idea I should try to come up with something for that because I have a visual in my head of of the flow but it might be a lot better if I could try to put that in some sort of like visual format for you all okay cool john b spotted a typo let's um let me wait i'm not going to change it right now i'm gonna wait and see what's up with with harsh its next pool request and then i'll change it ours was also asking did the male male trap work i know i didn't have a chance to to get it working before i so i just had to come straight for the meetings and started the stream so i didn't get a chance to even test it out aside from like the very first test i did that did not work see I can give it a shot I currently have have the info let me make sure that I have a there we go I'm gonna I don't want to show everybody my my dot mfiles so I'm moving it to my other screen and I'm gonna open it up there just to make sure that I have okay I do have the right stuff in there actually I did I changed my password and username so let me update that okay say that whoops let's make sure I lost my whoa oh I know why cuz I just messed it up with all this obviously I just added a bunch of stuff alright so I'm gonna remove the stuff that I just did because we have a pull request that is on its way I need to get this working at least see and I'm not that worried about getting rid of this because realistically I just copy and paste and some stuff I didn't even make any modifications so it'll take about three minutes to get all that stuff back in there again if I need to let's see that was everything right yeah let's just give it a little restart here see if that fixes things yep there we go I'm gonna try to submit an announcements whoa that's it no that's probably not gonna work because if it was going to work it would have worked already okay my timer did go up so let me do another five minutes on my news okay let me do another five minutes and let me go back up to where I left off three or four okay our arvind says is the initial setup done yeah the the setup for this project it's done if if you go back and watch some of the previous streams you'll be able to check out the initial setup so this is project force if you go back to project for day one then that'll be you know obviously the starting point Sebastian says don't you need a database to store data with Passport yes I would assume I think that's or that we were bringing in that store okay cool Gideon's watching so glad you could join us gideon says so late once hin don't worry about it I was late to my own stream zavier says just use the honor system for us yeah why don't I just make one password and then I'll just email that pass for it to everybody at the University and then it'll be easy right it will just it would just be really basic we'll just have like user name user 1 and password 1 2 3 4 right obvious that change it because I just told you that password so that could work I actually believe it or not I've seen systems like that where we have something that's password protected but literally the the password is shared with everyone that works at the University okay so a few you're talking about using JWT JSON web tokens so rang Shu says JSON web tokens could work with just email just validate the email for a valid one as they says is there a reason you don't want to use JSON web tokens since the university has an email address send the link to the email and that should do the job I guess so let me think don't you think okay so let me sink through and you all know I'm no expert on JSON web tokens and how to set that up so you all if you've used them help me out here so the flow for the user then would be they go to the site for the first time they put in their email address we send them an email then they would click the link in that email then that would take them that that would basically have the token that would validate them at that point we would then have to store we would have to store that data for that user and then if I want to keep them login we'd have to store in local storage or as a cookie or whatever some data for that user in their own browser and then when they try to come back we check for that is that correct is that how the flow should work and if so would it be easier to just implement something very simple like that on our own or should we use one of these other solutions arvind says i think you should consider using the mapping of the email with phone number if it ever be necessary to send SMS considering this we can proceed with password list i guess can we start now please yeah yeah with the SMS maybe we can have the option for users to link it to their phone number and then then I guess later on if they need to log back in they could choose to get a text instead of an email that it might actually be yeah that might actually be a nicer option for people who are trying to use their cell phone okay okay so it looks like in regard to the JSON web tokens that may end up being the simplest way to do it but we'll see because harsh it's working on this pool request so maybe I should see about that first okay let's see um so I guess I don't know that I want to I don't want to put pressure on Harsha to try to push something out this quickly so I don't know if we should wait for that probably not all right so you let me let me just go ahead three I know the timer went up but let me just finish up with all the questions in the live chat here and then we'll see if I finish up the questions and we have something from a pull request maybe we'll check it out otherwise maybe we'll just have to postpone and work on this so yeah so sorry I didn't really get that much accomplished but we did sift through a lot of options and got a lot of different ideas on what would be the best way to do this so it's it's not it was productive in that sense I did think I'd have more time beforehand to get some things ready so it just didn't happen oops oh cool Blake says hey Jesse has submitted a pull request on the free code camp guides can you check it out to see if it reads whoa and it's helpful link okay cool off to check that out not right now but maybe after the stream I could check it out I just saw this some hard he says the the passport module so the passport password list repo says it looks kind of it looks hacky he's they are using password lists internally that's crazy arvin says i think we have only harsh in the house who knows password this better than any we should listen to him he may got yeah yeah it does seem like harsh it has some experience with using password list okay cool dragon hunter unfortunately I didn't catch all this earlier when I was when I was actually doing some coding the dragon owner said we already said you already have note mailers set up you can use that transport yeah that makes a lot of sense we were already using it for the other emails so in our email Jas we're already bringing in node mailer so could've used that like I said my intention was to set everything up exactly like it was in the documentation for password list thinking that that would allow us to at least have something to test out as quickly as possible yeah buh buh Jen says boy that is a mess of code James says high school in 2003 I'm about to show my age high school for me was 94 computers we're not even a consideration when I was going to school and Brett says I'm Way older than James it's always interesting I wonder what age range we have in here I know we've had I'm pretty sure we've had people who are like less than 10 years old I can't remember the exact age but we had some people that are really young and I think we've had people in their 60s on the stream I think it's cool that we have such a big age range and a range of people from different locations around the world that's that's awesome that we all kind of work together you know on these projects Kaddi says TGIF thank goodness it's Friday yeah okay dragon hunter says why not an authentication micro service which will route East request a separate one I don't I don't know enough about it to know whether or not which one would be better which one wouldn't be better ok Umberto says when using Microsoft sequel we make a service account for the server machine to the database ok cool that's that's kind of what I was thinking we'd end up doing with the the WordPress is that we would have a user account on WordPress that would just basically just be for our server to connect to WordPress so I'm glad to hear that that's that's how it's done in other places as well because I mean it seemed like it would work to me but I wasn't sure that that would be you know the proper way to do it Ellen Umberto says and the application controls what date of the login an authenticated user sees yeah definitely that's that's how I was thinking that that it would work so so I'm not crazy that's the legit way Haven okay I'm getting towards the bottom of the live chat it's gonna check see if there's any more questions okay we got so Arvin says okay I might be a noob but don't worry about being a noob I knew that many things as well but says it might be a new but I just want to know how to make multiple single page applications and a website what I basically mean is I should be able to do single page application stuff in multiple pages in the website what I'm basically confused about is how do you segregate multiple modules and associated controllers and factories okay well I mean so you want to have a website to where different routes in the site so I guess different sub directories would be their own single page applications that's what that's what I'm getting from this if that's not what you're saying then please let me know I mean I guess as long as you have something that's sitting in front of your multiple single page applications that's routing it to the different ones I mean you could you could separate them out like that so I'm not I guess it's hard to it's hard for me to say without kind of seeing more like what do you what you're trying to do but whatever a routing system that you have just have the the various routes go to different different applications some thinking like usually I mean potentially depending on what you are using you could have so you can have it set up so that all right so usually how we set up our projects when we're using react and note is we have nginx as a reverse proxy potentially we could at that level of the of nginx route traffic to different node installations different react apps based on the URL so I mean you could do something like that or at the level of node and Express you could route things to different places you know at that point I'm just not exactly sure you know which you what you're kind of looking for in terms of how it's going to function I don't know maybe I'm misunderstanding things if anyone else has some some more information and I'll check down here it looks like alright it looks like you got some more info here okay so Arvind is saying I'm basically using angular 1 running it and it uses the controller and factory concept to send receive data into my view let's say I have five pages in my web app and all our single page applications meaning every page has say for routing so collectively there are 20 routes as a whole how do people manage to separate modules for each page oh okay I I have very very little experience with angular so I don't know that I'm the best person to to handle that question if we have any angular people let's see okay so dragon hunter seems to have some answers here so saying if it's the same app that routing is handled by the client app if it's for multiple apps you can use Doku which I've never used that and since in each app could be in a subdomain yeah definitely let's see okay okay cool so thanks dragon owner for for those answers yeah I'm definitely not I'm not very knowledgeable about angular stuff so I'll definitely admit when I don't have enough in all this to answer question properly okay we have some some ages here so seventeen twenty four thirty five thirty twenty six twenty I'm 31 I actually be 32 next week what's today I'll be 32 that on the 29th of October so soon okay harsh it says the PR is almost done uhhuh Paco says you know the last commit from angular was in 1886 they are still debugging the code at Google I don't want to get into any JavaScript framework Wars here John B says I believe you mean 1861 Paco that's when the great angular Civil War started when angular 2 changed the routing macho this is in react sitting looking at at angular analyst version with a big smile eric says angularjs plus one still learning more about react but it looks really great MD says hi hey how's it going thanks for joining us oh cool Blake said I'll be 15 in a month awesome actually Blake you might be the youngest one in the stream so cool awesome okay let me I think rat the bottom all right I'm at the bottom of the live chat I've gotten through everything so I know our shits pretty close to finishing up this pull request but I'm not sure not streaming away around for it maybe if I had eaten something today I might wait around for it but huh I'm really hungry so I'm right in the stream let's see let's say there's still some conversation going on here in the live stream but no no questions so yeah so I think there's definitely going to be a part two to the authentication and maybe down the road even a part three if we end up switching to something else so alright so my my energy level is is low so I probably wouldn't be very productive if I even try to do anything at this point so dragon owners to start a little Express project let's try password list I can't I don't have I'm I don't have the energy right now so yeah alright so it's Friday right so I'll be back Monday have a great day yeah so sorry didn't didn't really accomplish anything but we'll give it another go on Monday probably harsh it'll have some code for us to review and you know if anyone else has any ideas for you know what to do for authentication you know I'm still open to that as well it's very much still you know up for for discussion so I'll be back next week have a great weekend everybody and thanks for watching
