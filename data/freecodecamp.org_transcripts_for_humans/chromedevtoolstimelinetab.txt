00:00 - all right in this video we are going to
00:02 - be talking about the timeline tab of
00:05 - chrome developer tools when there are
00:07 - performance issues in your web page this
00:09 - is a great place to start because it
00:11 - records everything and you can look in
00:12 - detail from a whole bunch of different
00:14 - ways so we're going to do i'm just going
00:15 - to hit this record button
00:17 - i'm going to refresh the page
00:21 - it is capturing stacks profiles of the
00:23 - javascript memory and paint which is
00:25 - like css
00:27 - so once i do that i'm going to press the
00:30 - stop button
00:33 - okay it downloaded all this information
00:35 - and download it retrieved all this
00:37 - information
00:38 - it says the largest part was scripting
00:41 - of all the aggregated time
00:43 - what's really cool about this is how
00:44 - many ways it'll organize the information
00:47 - it just took it's just in a split second
00:49 - got all this data and it's going to
00:50 - organize it for you the best way that
00:52 - makes sense to you which i think is
00:53 - awesome
00:54 - so in this view you can zoom in on
00:56 - specific things it tells you exactly
00:58 - what scripting in this summary if we go
01:00 - down here this main thread
01:03 - and all these details again it's color
01:05 - coded each one of these green line the
01:07 - blue line the red line has to do with
01:08 - when the document object model is loaded
01:11 - let's go ahead and switch views to this
01:12 - way so here
01:15 - this is so awesome i'm geeking out right
01:17 - now so i'm still so excited about it if
01:19 - i click this first bar which is the
01:20 - biggest one as somebody who's not i'm
01:22 - not an expert in google development
01:23 - tools i'm still learning and i encourage
01:26 - all of you to do the same and just get
01:28 - in there play around click on things see
01:30 - what they mean if you have a question
01:32 - ask it's the best way to learn
01:35 - so this main thread went all the way
01:36 - throughout but here
01:38 - if we click on this
01:41 - save timeline data load timeline data
01:43 - it's going to bring it up in this lower
01:45 - bar here as well
01:46 - so i'm going to make this bigger i won't
01:48 - be able to see much of the main page
01:49 - anymore back to the timeline i click
01:51 - this and it brings up all this
01:53 - information
01:54 - about this one thing it says the type
01:57 - which is evaluate script the total time
01:59 - the self time the link to the script
02:01 - it'll take me exactly i'm going to click
02:03 - this where in the document this is this
02:06 - exact piece of code
02:08 - so if your page has a performance issues
02:10 - maybe his memory is not quite working
02:12 - the way you'd expect it to the whole
02:14 - thing's taking a long time this is a
02:16 - great place to look
02:18 - just to see exactly where the problem is
02:21 - what part of it's taking so long
02:23 - and it
02:25 - you can view that information and use it
02:26 - so efficiently to fix the problem
02:28 - quickly and get your page running
02:29 - smoothly
02:31 - what i want you to take away from this
02:33 - is not everything you're not going to be
02:34 - able to get it all at once get in there
02:36 - and play around with it and see which
02:38 - way works best for you when you're
02:40 - looking at all that information that it
02:41 - has to offer and remember when you're
02:43 - editing a page and editing the
02:44 - information for a page it's not going to
02:47 - save so if you fix a problem in the
02:48 - browser make sure you keep track of what
02:51 - you're doing so you can fix it in your
02:52 - original documents as well
