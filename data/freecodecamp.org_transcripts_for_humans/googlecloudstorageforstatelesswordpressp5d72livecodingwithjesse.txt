00:06 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:08 - with jesse i'm jesse and today
00:12 - we're going to set up
00:13 - google cloud storage and we're going to
00:16 - get that connected so that it works with
00:18 - wordpress
00:21 - last week we
00:24 - we got set up so that wordpress would
00:26 - work
00:28 - with uh google cloud sql
00:31 - uh so we did that just on a test account
00:35 - and what i
00:36 - what i did uh earlier today was i set up
00:40 - an official account uh for
00:43 - my employer
00:44 - and
00:46 - i created a cloud sql
00:49 - database uh
00:50 - you know under that account and today
00:52 - we're going to set up the storage bucket
00:54 - under that account as well
00:57 - so everything that we had done that's
00:59 - that's all all gone but
01:02 - we worked out a lot of stuff with that
01:05 - i did eventually get that working
01:07 - with
01:08 - uh
01:10 - i think where we left off on thursday
01:12 - we had almost everything working
01:15 - uh so i ended up getting it working the
01:17 - last little bit that didn't work was
01:19 - just the
01:21 - uh the ability for the wordpress
01:24 - installation running on now to connect
01:27 - uh to that
01:29 - my sql database
01:32 - so with now the ip addresses vary so
01:35 - much that
01:36 - you you can't just set an ip and have it
01:39 - access that
01:40 - so
01:41 - i had to end up just allowing any ip
01:44 - just to test it and make sure that it
01:46 - worked and when i did that it did work
01:49 - so what we'll do
01:52 - maybe not in today's stream depending on
01:54 - how much time it is but uh at some point
01:58 - we will set it up so that we can allow
02:01 - different
02:02 - lots of different ip addresses but then
02:04 - also uh we'll have ssl
02:06 - um
02:08 - setup as well so that really like we
02:11 - only allow connections that have the
02:12 - proper keys
02:14 - so it'll still be secure but it will
02:16 - also allow us to use
02:18 - now
02:19 - so that's the plan but today we're going
02:22 - to work on storage we're going to take a
02:23 - break from the sequel stuff
02:26 - um
02:28 - so let me get my headphones on
02:31 - so i forgot to get this set up
02:36 - i don't know if you've ever tried to
02:38 - stream or anything or do videos but
02:40 - there's just a really big difference
02:42 - when you have headphones on and music
02:44 - playing and
02:45 - as opposed to like when you don't
02:47 - i feel way more comfortable talking
02:50 - whenever i have the headphones on and
02:52 - the music playing
02:54 - so
02:56 - i'll get that going i do want to mention
02:58 - to you all well first of all i i want to
03:01 - see
03:02 - i want to say hello because a lot of you
03:04 - are saying hello
03:05 - um
03:07 - so yeah i am home today so christian
03:09 - yeah i'll be home today i'm going to be
03:11 - in the office tomorrow and the next day
03:14 - um so
03:16 - i have meetings and things going on
03:18 - hopefully i'll have enough time to
03:20 - stream though
03:23 - and
03:30 - all right cool got my spotify going
03:43 - oh so one more thing i'd like to
03:45 - announce i'm not gonna make a big deal
03:47 - about this all the time but i'm just
03:49 - gonna announce it maybe the first couple
03:51 - of streams just that everybody knows i
03:53 - started a patreon
03:56 - uh for those of you who don't know what
03:57 - that is it's it's kind of like
03:58 - crowdfunding for people who create
04:00 - content uh so it's like a monthly
04:04 - payment thing a monthly really like a
04:06 - donation so
04:08 - if anybody's interested uh check out
04:12 - my twitter and i i have a pin to tweet
04:16 - that has a link to that i'm not going to
04:18 - put a link to my patreon on these free
04:19 - code camp videos
04:21 - i'll put them on the videos on my own
04:23 - channel
04:24 - uh but basically what i'd like to be
04:26 - able to do is do more things like this
04:28 - so in addition to my live streams maybe
04:31 - do some streams of side projects
04:33 - uh do some tutorial videos
04:37 - and
04:38 - you know maybe even other things
04:41 - so maybe like
04:43 - if
04:44 - more like one-on-one mentoring and and
04:46 - things like that
04:47 - uh so
04:50 - if
04:52 - also like equipment right so the stream
04:55 - when i stream for my house it's not
04:56 - nearly as good a quality as i do for my
04:58 - office it'd be nice to be able to get
05:00 - some better equipment
05:01 - um you know things like that so
05:04 - if you're interested and you have a
05:06 - little bit to spare you know think about
05:08 - you know maybe supporting me through the
05:10 - patreon
05:11 - um but you know what i do now in terms
05:14 - of these live streams is totally free
05:16 - it's always going to be free i'm not
05:18 - trying to charge people especially for
05:19 - those of you who don't have you know a
05:21 - lot of money i know how it is starting
05:23 - out and just learning
05:25 - and not really having that much money so
05:27 - i want to be able to keep doing that
05:30 - and maybe even spend more time doing
05:32 - that
05:34 - so
05:35 - anyway so it's it's there i'm not gonna
05:38 - make a big deal about it uh but if if
05:41 - you can
05:42 - donate um please do and uh even if you
05:46 - can't if you
05:48 - like retweet or just spread the link
05:50 - around whenever you can you know that
05:52 - would be
05:53 - that would be awesome as well
05:56 - uh so that that's it for now i don't
05:58 - want to bug you all with the the patreon
06:01 - stuff so
06:03 - let's get started
06:08 - and
06:14 - i was just just checking real quick to
06:16 - see the uh
06:18 - the chat if there's anything i need to
06:19 - address first
06:39 - okay
06:46 - oh frankie asks about my twitter and my
06:48 - other channel
06:50 - uh i think my a link to my twitter and
06:52 - my other channel is in the description
06:54 - to this video
06:56 - so
06:58 - check that out and also like my
07:00 - i'm i'm most active on youtube twitter
07:03 - and
07:04 - instagram but i'm on like pretty much
07:06 - all the social channels so you can find
07:08 - me wherever you
07:10 - prefer to be
07:11 - and i keep my my dms open and stuff so
07:14 - don't don't worry about you know
07:16 - messaging me and that's totally fine i
07:18 - can't always get back to you immediately
07:20 - but i i try to answer
07:23 - you know all my messages
07:25 - and if you've messaged me and i've never
07:26 - messaged you back just remind me and
07:28 - message me again because it's not on
07:31 - purpose i just i probably just forgot
07:36 - aaron says let's get down to biz
07:41 - all right let me get on this other
07:43 - screen
07:45 - what we need to
07:50 - see
07:54 - i had this there it is i knew i had it
07:56 - up there okay
07:59 - so this is where we're gonna start i'm
08:01 - gonna make it a bit bigger
08:06 - all right so you see i was just working
08:07 - on the uh my sequel stuff so we're gonna
08:10 - switch over to the google cloud stuff
08:14 - and
08:15 - i'm starting my pomodoro timer on my
08:17 - other screen here
08:27 - okay
08:29 - so
08:31 - what i here's what i've done so far
08:34 - all i've done really is just created
08:36 - this
08:37 - uh fus main site
08:39 - project
08:41 - so when you go into
08:44 - my account
08:45 - is franciscan dot university
08:48 - but then within that you can have
08:50 - different projects
08:51 - so everything we do for this main
08:54 - website for this project five
08:56 - is going to be
09:00 - the fus main site
09:03 - uh project okay that'll i mean that
09:06 - helps to keep everything um
09:09 - all together
09:10 - so we're gonna make sure we're in that
09:12 - for everything
09:14 - i have happened it's happened before
09:15 - where i've accidentally been in the
09:16 - wrong project not for franciscan stuff
09:19 - but for
09:20 - like side project stuff and didn't
09:22 - realize it until i'd already set things
09:24 - up so just be careful of that if you are
09:26 - working on on things like this
09:31 - all right so let's navigate to
09:33 - [Music]
09:34 - the storage
09:43 - the storage tab
09:44 - and let's go ahead and take the quick
09:47 - start so it's not really that difficult
09:49 - but it's it's
09:50 - it'll probably be worth it to go step by
09:52 - step so
09:54 - my face is covering this quick start up
09:57 - so i'm going to move myself over to here
09:59 - for now
10:00 - because we won't be on this side of the
10:02 - screen
10:03 - quite as much
10:05 - and i'm gonna make this a bit bigger for
10:07 - you all
10:08 - if i make it too big i
10:10 - the the ui gets a little weird so
10:14 - hopefully that's that's big enough
10:18 - and
10:23 - so this is i it's gonna be pretty simple
10:25 - we're just gonna create the bucket
10:27 - basically
10:29 - um
10:30 - and then set it up for for wordpress
10:34 - all right so we're in the right project
10:36 - let's click continue these quick starts
10:38 - are really handy
10:40 - um
10:41 - for for google cloud platform so if
10:43 - you've never used it you want to get
10:45 - started
10:47 - then
10:49 - you know don't don't be too intimidated
10:54 - all right so let's click create bucket
11:01 - and we're going to call this
11:05 - uh fuswp storage
11:10 - and
11:11 - now we need to decide you know some of
11:13 - our our options here
11:16 - so let's go to this compare storage
11:19 - classes so that we can see
11:21 - you know what what are the options here
11:26 - so looks like they all have
11:30 - 99
11:33 - 99
11:34 - or more availability
11:40 - these three are all the same in terms of
11:42 - redundancy but the multi-regional
11:47 - uh definitely
11:49 - is better
11:50 - uh for that
11:57 - hmm
12:00 - all right so i think we're we're either
12:02 - going to have to go with regional or
12:03 - multi-regional for this
12:07 - i mean i would say the the bulk of our
12:11 - our visits do come from within a region
12:13 - but we we also get visits
12:19 - all over the world as well
12:22 - let's see
12:28 - all right the costs are are
12:30 - pretty similar there
12:35 - hmm
12:39 - uh let's calculate i'd like to see what
12:41 - monthly costs are
12:58 - all right
13:02 - i don't know what class a and class b
13:04 - operations are creating buckets
13:05 - uploading objects deleting permissions
13:07 - okay
13:11 - all right that makes sense
13:25 - all right let's see
13:39 - oh harsh it says visits that doesn't
13:41 - matter for this well i'm
13:44 - in terms of um
13:48 - the data being access
13:50 - when a user does come to the site
13:53 - the
13:55 - let's say an image
13:57 - will be served directly from this
14:01 - so
14:02 - in terms of how many
14:06 - um
14:07 - how many times like this date is being
14:09 - accessed
14:11 - uh
14:14 - it's
14:14 - i think it is relevant right or from
14:17 - where it's being accessed it is relevant
14:22 - all right let's try
14:26 - i guess
14:32 - estimated cost 6.50 actually that's
14:35 - really cheap
14:37 - let me just uh jack these up a little
14:39 - bit just to get an estimated
14:43 - cost
14:44 - it's still only
14:47 - all right let's see like if we have
14:50 - i don't know a terabyte
14:53 - it's still only 28 all right we're we're
14:55 - fine
14:57 - we're definitely fine
14:59 - i wonder why you know what i suppose
15:01 - regional depends on the region for the
15:03 - cost huh
15:04 - 92 31.
15:07 - yeah there's
15:09 - the difference between mulchy
15:10 - multi-regional and regional is so small
15:12 - in cost
15:14 - i'm definitely going to go with the
15:16 - multi-regional
15:18 - especially thinking ahead for the future
15:21 - uh the university really wants to be
15:23 - able to serve more people in a broader
15:25 - geographic area so i think this would be
15:30 - a better way to go
15:32 - all right cool let's select
15:34 - multi-regional
15:39 - and
15:40 - i'm going to check out the advanced
15:41 - settings don't really think
15:44 - i want to change them though it is
15:46 - encrypted automatically
15:51 - yeah i'm not
15:55 - yeah i'm gonna let google handle that
15:56 - encryption
15:58 - because that's not really my specialty
16:00 - so i think if i mess with it i'd be more
16:02 - likely to
16:03 - mess it up than make it better
16:19 - okay
16:28 - all right cool so that's it like
16:29 - literally we've set up the storage
16:31 - bucket right we could upload files right
16:33 - now
16:34 - uh i'm not gonna do that so what what
16:37 - i'll do is when i'm in the office
16:38 - tomorrow
16:39 - uh i will
16:41 - move over
16:42 - all of
16:44 - the images and pdfs and whatever other
16:47 - uh
16:48 - files are
16:51 - being used for the main site right now
16:53 - as it is the old one
16:54 - i'm gonna move all those over to here
16:56 - and keep the file structure the same
17:00 - um
17:01 - i don't know if you'll remember but the
17:03 - way we're doing it right now is uh
17:05 - because of what most of those assets use
17:09 - relative urls
17:11 - we were able to bring over the markup as
17:14 - is
17:15 - and then we just made uh just a little
17:18 - function
17:19 - uh with i that i believe is irregular
17:22 - uses uh regular expressions
17:24 - in react and it just prepends
17:28 - the correct uh url onto that path
17:32 - so right now it's prepending
17:34 - franciscan.edu
17:36 - because it works for now but once we
17:38 - switch over where the domain name is
17:40 - pointed to it's not going to work
17:42 - anymore so what we're going to end up
17:44 - doing is prepending whatever url
17:47 - uh we have to get access to this stuff
17:59 - okay
18:08 - let's continue
18:11 - see what else yep that's it
18:13 - literally
18:14 - very simple
18:21 - let's close all right i'm very satisfied
18:24 - that was really easy so let's close this
18:26 - tutorial all right so we have a bucket
18:30 - now the next step
18:32 - which i assume will be slightly more
18:34 - difficult is setting this up to work
18:37 - with wordpress
18:39 - so if you've never done anything with
18:41 - wordpress before don't worry
18:44 - i'm gonna go through it
18:46 - so right now
18:47 - [Music]
18:49 - this is still the version that's hosted
18:51 - on digitalocean i didn't quite get far
18:54 - enough this morning i was hoping to have
18:56 - it all moved over to now uh
19:00 - before i started the stream but i i ran
19:02 - out of time
19:03 - uh but it's okay because
19:07 - whatever we do on this when we do
19:09 - migrate to now we're going to migrate
19:10 - everything over as is so it's
19:14 - we're not going to have to duplicate
19:15 - work
19:18 - so i need to go down well first of all
19:20 - let me make this bigger
19:22 - so if you've never seen it before this
19:24 - is the wordpress admin panel let me move
19:26 - my face back over
19:30 - here
19:33 - so this is the wordpress admin panel
19:36 - and
19:37 - there are
19:38 - there's more than one way to
19:41 - uh upload a plug-in
19:42 - to wordpress but we're going to use the
19:44 - the admin panel way
19:49 - so let's add a new plugin
19:55 - and we're going to search
20:00 - for this wp stateless plugin
20:03 - so there's a there's actually a plug-in
20:07 - that
20:08 - does exactly what we want to do
20:12 - already for wordpress so this is going
20:15 - to be super useful
20:17 - and save us a lot of time
20:20 - so
20:23 - really it's it's pretty simple
20:25 - right we can
20:27 - we have different modes we're going to
20:29 - end up going with the stateless mode but
20:30 - you can use this just to have google
20:33 - storage be a backup
20:35 - for your wordpress stuff
20:38 - we can use it
20:40 - as a cdn
20:43 - so it copies media files and then serves
20:45 - them from there
20:47 - or stateless where it actually stores
20:50 - and serves the media file so it's it's
20:51 - basically like a combination of these
20:53 - two
20:55 - so we have no local local meaning
20:58 - like on the same server as wordpress
21:00 - there's no local storage that's what we
21:02 - want
21:03 - because if we're going to serve this
21:04 - with now basically as
21:07 - as if it were like a static site
21:12 - that's what we need we need to take out
21:13 - the database which we're doing and we
21:16 - need to take out
21:18 - the file storage which this will will do
21:22 - so let's install this
21:30 - and activate
21:35 - wonderful and it has a setup assistant
21:38 - so that's great
21:39 - so let's check this out
21:43 - google login
21:59 - all right which one
22:02 - this one
22:11 - hasn't been verified by google yet only
22:13 - proceed yes uh
22:21 - now like normally that warning would
22:23 - mean something but i've already
22:24 - researched this app beforehand for the
22:26 - last few weeks so
22:28 - uh so that's why i clicked go ahead so
22:31 - quickly if you do see a warning like
22:33 - that with something you're not familiar
22:34 - with don't just click
22:39 - okay
22:45 - so essentially we need to give that
22:46 - plug-in permission to access
22:49 - our google storage obviously right if it
22:52 - needs to be able to upload things to
22:54 - there
22:57 - then it we need to give it access
23:01 - all right so
23:03 - default the google cloud projects
23:07 - is
23:12 - fus main site
23:14 - the cloud bucket
23:16 - is
23:20 - fuswp storage
23:26 - great and
23:30 - cool so you see it's already grabbed a
23:32 - lot of the stuff for us which is awesome
23:35 - right when i double clicked i got a drop
23:36 - down and i could see the projects we set
23:38 - up so obviously
23:40 - it is connected
23:45 - um
23:46 - so when you
23:47 - work with wordpress you can make a post
23:50 - like a blog post and you have the option
23:52 - to upload a file or an image right there
23:55 - in the
23:57 - you know in browser editor
23:59 - so normally that upload will just go
24:02 - into a file
24:04 - uh on your wordpress server but what's
24:07 - gonna happen now that we've installed
24:09 - this plugin is when we upload something
24:11 - it's gonna go to our google cloud
24:14 - storage
24:15 - all right so let's do it let's try to
24:17 - upload something
24:21 - all right we're going to select the file
24:24 - actually let me
24:25 - i have my file thing open i'll just drop
24:27 - some stuff in there
24:30 - um i will drop
24:35 - this beautiful image that
24:40 - i took of myself earlier
24:48 - there we go
24:52 - all right so that's uploaded let's
24:53 - verify
24:54 - and go to the media library
24:57 - see that we can actually still see this
24:59 - from wordpress
25:02 - oh yeah look at that handsome guy i'm
25:04 - just joking
25:07 - all right but there's our image
25:09 - we can check it out and see like hey
25:11 - it's it's here
25:12 - all the regular info awesome
25:16 - um
25:17 - oh there's a setting
25:19 - i actually want to see these settings
25:22 - stateless
25:26 - your file url replacement enable
25:29 - yes
25:31 - and
25:32 - there we go bucket folder
25:38 - yeah i do i want it to be wp
25:41 - wp folder
25:49 - all right so you also have part of this
25:51 - private key
25:53 - i'm cool with that though because
25:56 - there's no way you're going to guess the
25:57 - rest of the private key
26:01 - what is the different wordpress enable
26:04 - yep
26:10 - yep so there's this is where uh the urls
26:13 - will actually point
26:23 - uh if we want to we could change the
26:25 - domain i may end up doing that at some
26:27 - point but not today then it'd be cleaner
26:29 - like it could be like
26:31 - i don't know like
26:32 - franciscan dot
26:34 - uh it could be like cdn.franciscan.edu
26:38 - right that that might be something that
26:40 - we'd want to do
26:43 - into year and month based folders yeah
26:45 - so that year in month based folder
26:47 - that's the default wordpress behavior i
26:49 - would like to keep that it's um it's
26:52 - somewhat useful and since that's typical
26:54 - wordpress i i want to keep it like that
26:57 - all right let's save those changes
27:05 - great and
27:07 - check these out
27:21 - that ability
27:28 - yep this what i want to do uh this is
27:31 - one of the reasons why i really wanted
27:32 - this plugin so
27:34 - when you upload a file to wordpress it
27:36 - automatically makes multiple image sizes
27:40 - uh which
27:42 - is very useful
27:44 - uh so what we're gonna do eventually
27:48 - is
27:50 - we will
27:54 - within our react components
27:57 - we'll set it up so that if we're
27:58 - bringing in an image we'll use source
28:00 - set
28:01 - and
28:02 - we'll select different sizes of that
28:04 - image and depending on the screen width
28:07 - we'll serve the image that is most
28:09 - appropriately sized so we will save the
28:13 - user a lot of data like that will get
28:16 - faster load times
28:18 - normally that's a pain if you have to
28:20 - make the image sizes yourself
28:22 - but if wordpress is going to do it for
28:24 - us then we can trust that
28:26 - assuming that an appropriately sized
28:29 - image was uploaded at first
28:31 - we'll have all these different sizes to
28:33 - choose from
28:35 - uh so
28:36 - definitely going to enable that so
28:38 - obviously that first one that we just
28:40 - uploaded it probably won't happen for
28:42 - that
28:44 - uh it shows compatibility with image
28:46 - dropping
28:47 - say this i'm going to enable that
28:50 - force download method
28:54 - that's for several css files
28:59 - yeah i don't think we're gonna have to
29:00 - deal with css
29:03 - so save that
29:07 - all right cool
29:11 - all right now let's check our bucket
29:14 - let's see if we got anything in our
29:15 - bucket yet
29:19 - oh i could refresh right from there
29:22 - wasn't looking
29:25 - we should have something in our bucket
29:30 - although it's possible i needed to do
29:31 - the settings first oh here we go we have
29:34 - a folder now
29:35 - let's click it
29:39 - the folder was 2018
29:41 - and now we have a folder for the fifth
29:43 - month in 2018
29:47 - and
29:48 - whoa check that out
29:51 - so here we have look at this this is our
29:53 - original image
29:55 - we have an image now that is 768 pixels
30:00 - by 10.98 we have one that's 716 by 1024
30:05 - we have one that's 210 by 300
30:09 - 1533 by 1200
30:11 - we have 150 by 150 and 100 by 100
30:15 - so all those image sizes have now been
30:18 - created
30:20 - and you can see like
30:22 - this is the original 354 kilobytes
30:25 - well let's say i don't need that one
30:27 - that big let's say i'm on a phone and
30:29 - i'm fine with one that's 210 by 300. now
30:32 - i'm down to 11.
30:35 - that's a huge huge difference
30:38 - right so that's that's the benefit that
30:40 - we get from allowing all these different
30:42 - sizes
30:43 - you know to come in see and they all
30:45 - have their own public links
30:48 - so let's just check this out
30:50 - see we can see that image right i can
30:52 - copy and paste this into the chat and
30:54 - you all should be able to see that image
30:57 - so this
30:59 - link can now be used
31:01 - to serve images directly on our websites
31:12 - i don't know that's pretty cool to me
31:14 - uh
31:15 - i don't know how cool it is if you've
31:16 - never worked with wordpress before
31:18 - um
31:20 - but
31:22 - i i think it's cool enough that even if
31:23 - you've never worked with wordpress as
31:25 - long as you've done something with
31:26 - websites before
31:28 - you should probably be able to
31:29 - appreciate the awesomeness of that
31:32 - all right now i think my timer's about
31:34 - to be up yeah i got about a minute and a
31:36 - half now so i'm not gonna work on
31:39 - the next thing
31:40 - just yet i'm gonna go to the live chat
31:42 - and start answering questions
31:47 - and
31:50 - let me scroll all the way up to the top
31:52 - so you can
31:54 - uh so don't miss any of your questions
32:06 - i should have said so that solution
32:08 - worked that day
32:09 - yeah so i earlier in the stream i talked
32:11 - about how i got the uh sql database that
32:14 - we made last thursday to work with
32:16 - wordpress uh horoshit had the wonderful
32:19 - idea of why don't you just allow all ip
32:21 - addresses and i thought yeah that's a
32:24 - great idea who cares it's a test
32:26 - database anyway like let's just do it
32:30 - uh and that worked so
32:33 - that was all i needed basically i for
32:35 - that test one i just needed to
32:37 - see that it worked
32:40 - and once i saw that it worked i shut
32:42 - down the database and that was that was
32:45 - all i needed
32:51 - uh
32:53 - daniel asks can you use google cloud to
32:55 - host your wordpress uh actually i think
32:58 - you can i think you can do everything
33:00 - right from google we're not gonna do
33:02 - the actual wordpress installation
33:06 - uh oh is that my
33:08 - sorry
33:10 - sorry if that beep was super loud for
33:12 - you
33:13 - that was my timer
33:15 - so let's do the short break now
33:18 - uh for
33:21 - the live chat
33:27 - uh yeah so anyway the answer the
33:28 - question is yes i believe you can host
33:32 - uh wordpress with google cloud
33:36 - i'm not sure exactly how you can figure
33:38 - that but i think it's possible
33:46 - gustavo says got my first invite for a
33:48 - skype interview really excited wow
33:50 - congratulations uh i'm really excited
33:53 - for you as well please let us know how
33:55 - it goes
34:06 - oh
34:08 - frankie uh i just saw your comment about
34:10 - you saw it in the show notes don't worry
34:13 - about it it's so easy to miss that stuff
34:15 - i have so many links in the notes anyway
34:18 - like
34:18 - it's
34:20 - totally understandable don't worry about
34:22 - it
34:28 - okay uh her
34:31 - uh harshit's making a ui library
34:34 - in connection with our javascript.af
34:38 - project
34:39 - so let me throw that up on the screen
34:42 - really quickly
34:46 - i'm gonna have to check
34:52 - i don't remember the link off hand har
34:53 -  so i'm gonna go into twitter and
34:55 - grab the link that you um
34:59 - that you gave me
35:03 - uh in a dm
35:06 - okay so while this is loading so slowly
35:10 - i'll read some more questions
35:17 - aaron says pomodoro for the win yeah for
35:19 - sure love pomodoro
35:22 - i need to make a video just about how i
35:24 - use pomodoro
35:25 - because it's just been so helpful
35:33 - uh christian asks why did you choose
35:35 - google cloud platform over the other
35:37 - ones out there oh good question
35:39 - uh good question let me explain my my
35:42 - reasoning uh so
35:49 - last week there were some different
35:50 - options that we're going over so here's
35:52 - why i end up choosing google cloud
35:56 - um i never heard back about whether or
36:00 - not we could get a discount from
36:02 - microsoft for azure
36:04 - um
36:06 - but
36:08 - it seemed like the cheapest between
36:11 - azure aws and google cloud which were
36:13 - the top three that i was considering
36:17 - it seemed like
36:19 - google cloud was going to be the least
36:21 - expensive
36:23 - so given that
36:25 - and also that i already had gone through
36:26 - workshops
36:28 - that was using google cloud stuff and
36:31 - i have uh francisco
36:34 - that works at google cloud i'm able to
36:36 - you know send her a dm and ask questions
36:40 - uh
36:41 - that that was just huge for me that the
36:44 - familiarity that i already have
36:46 - uh you like we already had
36:48 - you know a google account
36:51 - set up for
36:52 - uh for where i work
36:56 - and
36:58 - you know being able to just
37:00 - have that
37:01 - that connection to somebody that
37:02 - actually works there
37:04 - that seemed to me like it kind of just
37:06 - put me a little bit over the top and and
37:08 - choosing that
37:10 - the cool thing about this though
37:12 - is that potentially and with very little
37:14 - work we could switch over to a different
37:16 - platform
37:17 - all we'd have to do is copy over the
37:18 - database
37:20 - and then within wordpress we just change
37:22 - the wp config file
37:24 - to point to that different database
37:26 - uh and of course we'd have to find a
37:28 - plugin that could connect us
37:31 - to that database or modify the current
37:33 - plugin
37:36 - but really it's but
37:37 - because of the way we built this
37:39 - this whole project uh it's purposely
37:42 - very flexible
37:44 - uh and
37:45 - you know each piece could potentially be
37:47 - replaced without that much work
37:50 - so if we end up getting a good deal for
37:52 - microsoft or you know somebody totally
37:55 - new comes in and we like them better
37:58 - then we're we're good
38:02 - uh this is the ui project that harshit
38:05 - is working on so
38:07 - uh basically this is the the ui that
38:10 - we're using for
38:11 - javascript.af
38:13 - and so he's taking it and
38:16 - you know building out a component
38:18 - library from that and what will happen
38:20 - is i don't think it's set up right now
38:22 - but you should be able to click on one
38:24 - of these
38:25 - and then get
38:26 - all the markup that you need to use it
38:30 - you know down here so the actual code
38:31 - will be there and these will be react
38:33 - components
38:35 - so
38:37 - uh just you know basic right now just
38:40 - starting out i i think this is pretty
38:42 - amazing
38:45 - uh you know really simple interface to
38:47 - be able to go through and
38:49 - see the component so
38:52 - check it out i'll paste the link in the
38:54 - chat if any of you want to go to it and
38:58 - uh play with it a little bit
39:01 - you know but definitely let heart should
39:02 - know
39:03 - what you think
39:05 - uh he's been
39:06 - a harshest is
39:08 - harsher worked so hard on on all
39:11 - just so much stuff side projects and on
39:13 - the projects we work on on the stream
39:14 - like i don't
39:16 - i don't know how he does it all
39:18 - but uh
39:20 - yeah but please let him know what you
39:21 - think
39:24 - i think my timer went off yet the timer
39:26 - went off
39:27 - uh let me
39:30 - you know what let me go through the
39:31 - questions
39:32 - the rest of the questions here and then
39:35 - we'll see what time it is and we'll
39:36 - decide whether or not we want to
39:39 - move on now and do some stuff with the
39:41 - sql database or
39:43 - because technically we've accomplished
39:45 - what we want to accomplish
39:47 - it just didn't take that long everything
39:49 - worked out
39:50 - um
39:51 - so
39:52 - let me know what you all think now in
39:54 - the chat
39:56 - if you'd like to keep this short and
39:58 - sweet to the point
39:59 - and then
40:01 - move on tomorrow with another stream or
40:04 - if you'd like to go on a bit longer and
40:06 - maybe branch out do some stuff with sql
40:09 - um
40:12 - either way works for me
40:13 - probably the deciding factor for me is
40:15 - going to be how hungry i am once i
40:16 - finish answering these questions
40:22 - i should ask if there's a three dollar
40:24 - uh option on patreon uh i will join if
40:27 - it is
40:28 - um
40:30 - yeah so there is on my patreon i have
40:32 - different tiers
40:34 - uh of rewards
40:36 - i i really am totally new to patreon so
40:38 - if you have ideas for rewards please let
40:40 - me know there's a poll up right now on
40:42 - my patreon page of like
40:45 - potential awards so
40:47 - vote for that or if you have a different
40:49 - idea just let me know i'm open to
40:51 - anything i just wanted to have a few
40:53 - options there just
40:54 - so that you can see you know what's
40:56 - possible
40:58 - but the the lowest tier is three dollars
41:01 - uh but you can
41:03 - like if you wanted to just donate a
41:05 - dollar
41:09 - sorry you could do that too
41:13 - you know i don't think you're limited to
41:15 - just the the levels of funding that i've
41:18 - set there
41:33 - julio says the sla is very low
41:37 - i don't know what sla stands for could
41:40 - you let me know julio
41:41 - and i'm not i don't remember what i was
41:43 - doing
41:44 - when you said that and what that was
41:45 - related to maybe i was
41:52 - maybe that one out was when i was
41:54 - picking options for the uh
41:57 - for the storage bucket
42:25 - hey bobby says this is awesome
42:28 - thanks bobby
42:35 - ezekiel says hi hey ezekiel how's it
42:37 - going
42:40 - matt duchess says check out jesse's
42:41 - patreon
42:43 - and uh mad duchess thank you for being a
42:46 - patron i really appreciate that
42:57 - javier says is google storage the same
42:59 - as aws
43:01 - um
43:02 - okay so
43:04 - google cloud platform is the same as aws
43:07 - they're comparable
43:09 - uh so google storage
43:12 - would be comparable i think to s3 in aws
43:18 - so they're they're google storage is
43:20 - just a piece of google cloud platform so
43:24 - but yeah basically just with that
43:27 - little distinction i would say yeah they
43:29 - pretty much offer a lot of the same
43:31 - services
43:41 - eric is asking for thoughts on slash
43:44 - experience with magento 2.
43:47 - i have no experience with magento
43:50 - uh so i am
43:52 - sorry about that and i don't i don't
43:54 - know enough about it to even give
43:57 - uh any
43:59 - anything i mean it's a um
44:03 - uh
44:05 - that's what i'm looking for in an
44:06 - e-commerce platform right
44:09 - see i'm not even sure what it is i
44:11 - believe it's an e-commerce platform but
44:13 - that that's where my knowledge stops so
44:15 - i don't want to try to pretend and
44:17 - like i know what i'm talking about there
44:19 - if anybody else has any uh thoughts or
44:21 - experience with magento too please let
44:23 - eric know
44:33 - matt dutchess says i was first to donate
44:35 - because you rock jesse yeah for sure i
44:37 - was super excited when i saw that
44:40 - uh that was awesome so uh thank you i
44:43 - was um
44:46 - yesterday i wasn't at my computer for
44:48 - most of the day

46:23 - there we go actually how about this one
46:25 - of my reward tiers on patreon will be
46:27 - you get access to all those
46:30 - uh blackmail worthy stills from the live
46:33 - streams
46:42 - uh cj says i'm new to free code camp and
46:44 - i just created my profile today all
46:46 - right
46:47 - uh congratulations on that and welcome
46:50 - to free code camp
46:52 - so there's so much
46:54 - there's so much to free code camp so
46:57 - definitely the core of free code camp is
46:59 - you know freecodecam.org and those
47:01 - lessons that's where it all started
47:04 - um
47:05 - those are super helpful
47:07 - uh to go through those but then there's
47:09 - so much supplementary material with the
47:12 - medium publication
47:14 - and the youtube videos and
47:17 - what else we have that like wikipedia
47:19 - type
47:20 - thing i can't remember what we call it
47:22 - uh it just has a wealth of information
47:26 - on a ton of different uh coding and tech
47:29 - related topics
47:31 - uh there's a forum
47:33 - i'm sure i'm probably missing something
47:34 - else that we do there's a newsletter
47:37 - uh but there's just so much so you know
47:39 - please take
47:40 - take advantage of all these free
47:42 - resources and uh it's it's definitely
47:45 - helped me to become a better uh better
47:47 - coder

48:41 - i actually got some some sun
48:44 - you know i
48:46 - as a programmer i rarely get out right
48:48 - that's the stereotype but i was actually
48:51 - out in the sunlight yesterday i mean i
48:53 - got more sun yesterday than i had in
48:55 - like the last two weeks combined
48:59 - um
49:00 - all right cool so i've gotten to the
49:01 - bottom of the chat
49:04 - so
49:07 - let's see what time it is
49:11 - i don't know i'm kind of thinking
49:15 - maybe maybe i'll just
49:18 - we'll finish up here
49:19 - keep this stream on topic for once
49:22 - um
49:24 - and then
49:27 - yeah we'll see maybe i'll maybe we'll
49:30 - work on getting everything combined
49:32 - together like basically
49:34 - production ready
49:36 - uh tomorrow
49:39 - and i'm not sure i said before the
49:41 - launch date is june 4th uh but
49:46 - potentially it might get pushed back
49:49 - i don't really want it to get pushed
49:50 - back but it may be reasonable i had
49:52 - expected to have a little bit more help
49:54 - uh in terms of like data migration and
49:57 - cleaning up data
49:58 - then i did
50:00 - uh so
50:02 - my original estimates were based on that
50:04 - that help which i didn't have
50:07 - so we'll see we'll see how it goes i
50:09 - suppose it is better to launch it and
50:11 - have everything work than to try to rush
50:13 - it
50:14 - so i'm still going to try to do as much
50:16 - as i can before the fourth but we may
50:17 - not launch then either way i still would
50:20 - like to have all the the setup
50:22 - of the database and everything
50:24 - you know squared away
50:28 - all right cool oh harsh it's just back
50:30 - from dinner eating ice cream uh ice
50:32 - cream i've been on a diet for the last
50:34 - like month so
50:37 - ice cream sounds so good right now
50:41 - um
50:42 - all right
50:43 - thank you all so much for watching
50:46 - i really appreciate it i'm actually
50:49 - i'm really happy that everything went
50:51 - perfectly
50:53 - that rarely happens
50:54 - um
50:57 - i'm i'm really gonna try to be back
50:59 - tomorrow for a stream i do have some
51:01 - meetings tomorrow
51:03 - um
51:04 - i can't even remember what time they are
51:06 - i gotta check my calendar so
51:08 - i'll do my best to let everyone know
51:10 - early on in twitter and uh on instagram
51:13 - what time i'm gonna stream hopefully i
51:16 - can get it scheduled early so you all
51:17 - can get the notifications on youtube
51:20 - um
51:22 - yeah so until then
51:24 - uh
51:26 - have a great day and thanks again for
51:27 - watching

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to set up google cloud storage and we're going to get that connected so that it works with wordpress last week we we got set up so that wordpress would work with uh google cloud sql uh so we did that just on a test account and what i what i did uh earlier today was i set up an official account uh for my employer and i created a cloud sql database uh you know under that account and today we're going to set up the storage bucket under that account as well so everything that we had done that's that's all all gone but we worked out a lot of stuff with that i did eventually get that working with uh i think where we left off on thursday we had almost everything working uh so i ended up getting it working the last little bit that didn't work was just the uh the ability for the wordpress installation running on now to connect uh to that my sql database so with now the ip addresses vary so much that you you can't just set an ip and have it access that so i had to end up just allowing any ip just to test it and make sure that it worked and when i did that it did work so what we'll do maybe not in today's stream depending on how much time it is but uh at some point we will set it up so that we can allow different lots of different ip addresses but then also uh we'll have ssl um setup as well so that really like we only allow connections that have the proper keys so it'll still be secure but it will also allow us to use now so that's the plan but today we're going to work on storage we're going to take a break from the sequel stuff um so let me get my headphones on so i forgot to get this set up i don't know if you've ever tried to stream or anything or do videos but there's just a really big difference when you have headphones on and music playing and as opposed to like when you don't i feel way more comfortable talking whenever i have the headphones on and the music playing so i'll get that going i do want to mention to you all well first of all i i want to see i want to say hello because a lot of you are saying hello um so yeah i am home today so christian yeah i'll be home today i'm going to be in the office tomorrow and the next day um so i have meetings and things going on hopefully i'll have enough time to stream though and all right cool got my spotify going oh so one more thing i'd like to announce i'm not gonna make a big deal about this all the time but i'm just gonna announce it maybe the first couple of streams just that everybody knows i started a patreon uh for those of you who don't know what that is it's it's kind of like crowdfunding for people who create content uh so it's like a monthly payment thing a monthly really like a donation so if anybody's interested uh check out my twitter and i i have a pin to tweet that has a link to that i'm not going to put a link to my patreon on these free code camp videos i'll put them on the videos on my own channel uh but basically what i'd like to be able to do is do more things like this so in addition to my live streams maybe do some streams of side projects uh do some tutorial videos and you know maybe even other things so maybe like if more like oneonone mentoring and and things like that uh so if also like equipment right so the stream when i stream for my house it's not nearly as good a quality as i do for my office it'd be nice to be able to get some better equipment um you know things like that so if you're interested and you have a little bit to spare you know think about you know maybe supporting me through the patreon um but you know what i do now in terms of these live streams is totally free it's always going to be free i'm not trying to charge people especially for those of you who don't have you know a lot of money i know how it is starting out and just learning and not really having that much money so i want to be able to keep doing that and maybe even spend more time doing that so anyway so it's it's there i'm not gonna make a big deal about it uh but if if you can donate um please do and uh even if you can't if you like retweet or just spread the link around whenever you can you know that would be that would be awesome as well uh so that that's it for now i don't want to bug you all with the the patreon stuff so let's get started and i was just just checking real quick to see the uh the chat if there's anything i need to address first okay oh frankie asks about my twitter and my other channel uh i think my a link to my twitter and my other channel is in the description to this video so check that out and also like my i'm i'm most active on youtube twitter and instagram but i'm on like pretty much all the social channels so you can find me wherever you prefer to be and i keep my my dms open and stuff so don't don't worry about you know messaging me and that's totally fine i can't always get back to you immediately but i i try to answer you know all my messages and if you've messaged me and i've never messaged you back just remind me and message me again because it's not on purpose i just i probably just forgot aaron says let's get down to biz all right let me get on this other screen what we need to see i had this there it is i knew i had it up there okay so this is where we're gonna start i'm gonna make it a bit bigger all right so you see i was just working on the uh my sequel stuff so we're gonna switch over to the google cloud stuff and i'm starting my pomodoro timer on my other screen here okay so what i here's what i've done so far all i've done really is just created this uh fus main site project so when you go into my account is franciscan dot university but then within that you can have different projects so everything we do for this main website for this project five is going to be the fus main site uh project okay that'll i mean that helps to keep everything um all together so we're gonna make sure we're in that for everything i have happened it's happened before where i've accidentally been in the wrong project not for franciscan stuff but for like side project stuff and didn't realize it until i'd already set things up so just be careful of that if you are working on on things like this all right so let's navigate to the storage the storage tab and let's go ahead and take the quick start so it's not really that difficult but it's it's it'll probably be worth it to go step by step so my face is covering this quick start up so i'm going to move myself over to here for now because we won't be on this side of the screen quite as much and i'm gonna make this a bit bigger for you all if i make it too big i the the ui gets a little weird so hopefully that's that's big enough and so this is i it's gonna be pretty simple we're just gonna create the bucket basically um and then set it up for for wordpress all right so we're in the right project let's click continue these quick starts are really handy um for for google cloud platform so if you've never used it you want to get started then you know don't don't be too intimidated all right so let's click create bucket and we're going to call this uh fuswp storage and now we need to decide you know some of our our options here so let's go to this compare storage classes so that we can see you know what what are the options here so looks like they all have 99 99 or more availability these three are all the same in terms of redundancy but the multiregional uh definitely is better uh for that hmm all right so i think we're we're either going to have to go with regional or multiregional for this i mean i would say the the bulk of our our visits do come from within a region but we we also get visits all over the world as well let's see all right the costs are are pretty similar there hmm uh let's calculate i'd like to see what monthly costs are all right i don't know what class a and class b operations are creating buckets uploading objects deleting permissions okay all right that makes sense all right let's see oh harsh it says visits that doesn't matter for this well i'm in terms of um the data being access when a user does come to the site the let's say an image will be served directly from this so in terms of how many um how many times like this date is being accessed uh it's i think it is relevant right or from where it's being accessed it is relevant all right let's try i guess estimated cost 6.50 actually that's really cheap let me just uh jack these up a little bit just to get an estimated cost it's still only all right let's see like if we have i don't know a terabyte it's still only 28 all right we're we're fine we're definitely fine i wonder why you know what i suppose regional depends on the region for the cost huh 92 31. yeah there's the difference between mulchy multiregional and regional is so small in cost i'm definitely going to go with the multiregional especially thinking ahead for the future uh the university really wants to be able to serve more people in a broader geographic area so i think this would be a better way to go all right cool let's select multiregional and i'm going to check out the advanced settings don't really think i want to change them though it is encrypted automatically yeah i'm not yeah i'm gonna let google handle that encryption because that's not really my specialty so i think if i mess with it i'd be more likely to mess it up than make it better okay all right cool so that's it like literally we've set up the storage bucket right we could upload files right now uh i'm not gonna do that so what what i'll do is when i'm in the office tomorrow uh i will move over all of the images and pdfs and whatever other uh files are being used for the main site right now as it is the old one i'm gonna move all those over to here and keep the file structure the same um i don't know if you'll remember but the way we're doing it right now is uh because of what most of those assets use relative urls we were able to bring over the markup as is and then we just made uh just a little function uh with i that i believe is irregular uses uh regular expressions in react and it just prepends the correct uh url onto that path so right now it's prepending franciscan.edu because it works for now but once we switch over where the domain name is pointed to it's not going to work anymore so what we're going to end up doing is prepending whatever url uh we have to get access to this stuff okay let's continue see what else yep that's it literally very simple let's close all right i'm very satisfied that was really easy so let's close this tutorial all right so we have a bucket now the next step which i assume will be slightly more difficult is setting this up to work with wordpress so if you've never done anything with wordpress before don't worry i'm gonna go through it so right now this is still the version that's hosted on digitalocean i didn't quite get far enough this morning i was hoping to have it all moved over to now uh before i started the stream but i i ran out of time uh but it's okay because whatever we do on this when we do migrate to now we're going to migrate everything over as is so it's we're not going to have to duplicate work so i need to go down well first of all let me make this bigger so if you've never seen it before this is the wordpress admin panel let me move my face back over here so this is the wordpress admin panel and there are there's more than one way to uh upload a plugin to wordpress but we're going to use the the admin panel way so let's add a new plugin and we're going to search for this wp stateless plugin so there's a there's actually a plugin that does exactly what we want to do already for wordpress so this is going to be super useful and save us a lot of time so really it's it's pretty simple right we can we have different modes we're going to end up going with the stateless mode but you can use this just to have google storage be a backup for your wordpress stuff we can use it as a cdn so it copies media files and then serves them from there or stateless where it actually stores and serves the media file so it's it's basically like a combination of these two so we have no local local meaning like on the same server as wordpress there's no local storage that's what we want because if we're going to serve this with now basically as as if it were like a static site that's what we need we need to take out the database which we're doing and we need to take out the file storage which this will will do so let's install this and activate wonderful and it has a setup assistant so that's great so let's check this out google login all right which one this one hasn't been verified by google yet only proceed yes uh now like normally that warning would mean something but i've already researched this app beforehand for the last few weeks so uh so that's why i clicked go ahead so quickly if you do see a warning like that with something you're not familiar with don't just click okay so essentially we need to give that plugin permission to access our google storage obviously right if it needs to be able to upload things to there then it we need to give it access all right so default the google cloud projects is fus main site the cloud bucket is fuswp storage great and cool so you see it's already grabbed a lot of the stuff for us which is awesome right when i double clicked i got a drop down and i could see the projects we set up so obviously it is connected um so when you work with wordpress you can make a post like a blog post and you have the option to upload a file or an image right there in the you know in browser editor so normally that upload will just go into a file uh on your wordpress server but what's gonna happen now that we've installed this plugin is when we upload something it's gonna go to our google cloud storage all right so let's do it let's try to upload something all right we're going to select the file actually let me i have my file thing open i'll just drop some stuff in there um i will drop this beautiful image that i took of myself earlier there we go all right so that's uploaded let's verify and go to the media library see that we can actually still see this from wordpress oh yeah look at that handsome guy i'm just joking all right but there's our image we can check it out and see like hey it's it's here all the regular info awesome um oh there's a setting i actually want to see these settings stateless your file url replacement enable yes and there we go bucket folder yeah i do i want it to be wp wp folder all right so you also have part of this private key i'm cool with that though because there's no way you're going to guess the rest of the private key what is the different wordpress enable yep yep so there's this is where uh the urls will actually point uh if we want to we could change the domain i may end up doing that at some point but not today then it'd be cleaner like it could be like i don't know like franciscan dot uh it could be like cdn.franciscan.edu right that that might be something that we'd want to do into year and month based folders yeah so that year in month based folder that's the default wordpress behavior i would like to keep that it's um it's somewhat useful and since that's typical wordpress i i want to keep it like that all right let's save those changes great and check these out that ability yep this what i want to do uh this is one of the reasons why i really wanted this plugin so when you upload a file to wordpress it automatically makes multiple image sizes uh which is very useful uh so what we're gonna do eventually is we will within our react components we'll set it up so that if we're bringing in an image we'll use source set and we'll select different sizes of that image and depending on the screen width we'll serve the image that is most appropriately sized so we will save the user a lot of data like that will get faster load times normally that's a pain if you have to make the image sizes yourself but if wordpress is going to do it for us then we can trust that assuming that an appropriately sized image was uploaded at first we'll have all these different sizes to choose from uh so definitely going to enable that so obviously that first one that we just uploaded it probably won't happen for that uh it shows compatibility with image dropping say this i'm going to enable that force download method that's for several css files yeah i don't think we're gonna have to deal with css so save that all right cool all right now let's check our bucket let's see if we got anything in our bucket yet oh i could refresh right from there wasn't looking we should have something in our bucket although it's possible i needed to do the settings first oh here we go we have a folder now let's click it the folder was 2018 and now we have a folder for the fifth month in 2018 and whoa check that out so here we have look at this this is our original image we have an image now that is 768 pixels by 10.98 we have one that's 716 by 1024 we have one that's 210 by 300 1533 by 1200 we have 150 by 150 and 100 by 100 so all those image sizes have now been created and you can see like this is the original 354 kilobytes well let's say i don't need that one that big let's say i'm on a phone and i'm fine with one that's 210 by 300. now i'm down to 11. that's a huge huge difference right so that's that's the benefit that we get from allowing all these different sizes you know to come in see and they all have their own public links so let's just check this out see we can see that image right i can copy and paste this into the chat and you all should be able to see that image so this link can now be used to serve images directly on our websites i don't know that's pretty cool to me uh i don't know how cool it is if you've never worked with wordpress before um but i i think it's cool enough that even if you've never worked with wordpress as long as you've done something with websites before you should probably be able to appreciate the awesomeness of that all right now i think my timer's about to be up yeah i got about a minute and a half now so i'm not gonna work on the next thing just yet i'm gonna go to the live chat and start answering questions and let me scroll all the way up to the top so you can uh so don't miss any of your questions i should have said so that solution worked that day yeah so i earlier in the stream i talked about how i got the uh sql database that we made last thursday to work with wordpress uh horoshit had the wonderful idea of why don't you just allow all ip addresses and i thought yeah that's a great idea who cares it's a test database anyway like let's just do it uh and that worked so that was all i needed basically i for that test one i just needed to see that it worked and once i saw that it worked i shut down the database and that was that was all i needed uh daniel asks can you use google cloud to host your wordpress uh actually i think you can i think you can do everything right from google we're not gonna do the actual wordpress installation uh oh is that my sorry sorry if that beep was super loud for you that was my timer so let's do the short break now uh for the live chat uh yeah so anyway the answer the question is yes i believe you can host uh wordpress with google cloud i'm not sure exactly how you can figure that but i think it's possible gustavo says got my first invite for a skype interview really excited wow congratulations uh i'm really excited for you as well please let us know how it goes oh frankie uh i just saw your comment about you saw it in the show notes don't worry about it it's so easy to miss that stuff i have so many links in the notes anyway like it's totally understandable don't worry about it okay uh her uh harshit's making a ui library in connection with our javascript.af project so let me throw that up on the screen really quickly i'm gonna have to check i don't remember the link off hand har so i'm gonna go into twitter and grab the link that you um that you gave me uh in a dm okay so while this is loading so slowly i'll read some more questions aaron says pomodoro for the win yeah for sure love pomodoro i need to make a video just about how i use pomodoro because it's just been so helpful uh christian asks why did you choose google cloud platform over the other ones out there oh good question uh good question let me explain my my reasoning uh so last week there were some different options that we're going over so here's why i end up choosing google cloud um i never heard back about whether or not we could get a discount from microsoft for azure um but it seemed like the cheapest between azure aws and google cloud which were the top three that i was considering it seemed like google cloud was going to be the least expensive so given that and also that i already had gone through workshops that was using google cloud stuff and i have uh francisco that works at google cloud i'm able to you know send her a dm and ask questions uh that that was just huge for me that the familiarity that i already have uh you like we already had you know a google account set up for uh for where i work and you know being able to just have that that connection to somebody that actually works there that seemed to me like it kind of just put me a little bit over the top and and choosing that the cool thing about this though is that potentially and with very little work we could switch over to a different platform all we'd have to do is copy over the database and then within wordpress we just change the wp config file to point to that different database uh and of course we'd have to find a plugin that could connect us to that database or modify the current plugin but really it's but because of the way we built this this whole project uh it's purposely very flexible uh and you know each piece could potentially be replaced without that much work so if we end up getting a good deal for microsoft or you know somebody totally new comes in and we like them better then we're we're good uh this is the ui project that harshit is working on so uh basically this is the the ui that we're using for javascript.af and so he's taking it and you know building out a component library from that and what will happen is i don't think it's set up right now but you should be able to click on one of these and then get all the markup that you need to use it you know down here so the actual code will be there and these will be react components so uh just you know basic right now just starting out i i think this is pretty amazing uh you know really simple interface to be able to go through and see the component so check it out i'll paste the link in the chat if any of you want to go to it and uh play with it a little bit you know but definitely let heart should know what you think uh he's been a harshest is harsher worked so hard on on all just so much stuff side projects and on the projects we work on on the stream like i don't i don't know how he does it all but uh yeah but please let him know what you think i think my timer went off yet the timer went off uh let me you know what let me go through the questions the rest of the questions here and then we'll see what time it is and we'll decide whether or not we want to move on now and do some stuff with the sql database or because technically we've accomplished what we want to accomplish it just didn't take that long everything worked out um so let me know what you all think now in the chat if you'd like to keep this short and sweet to the point and then move on tomorrow with another stream or if you'd like to go on a bit longer and maybe branch out do some stuff with sql um either way works for me probably the deciding factor for me is going to be how hungry i am once i finish answering these questions i should ask if there's a three dollar uh option on patreon uh i will join if it is um yeah so there is on my patreon i have different tiers uh of rewards i i really am totally new to patreon so if you have ideas for rewards please let me know there's a poll up right now on my patreon page of like potential awards so vote for that or if you have a different idea just let me know i'm open to anything i just wanted to have a few options there just so that you can see you know what's possible but the the lowest tier is three dollars uh but you can like if you wanted to just donate a dollar sorry you could do that too you know i don't think you're limited to just the the levels of funding that i've set there julio says the sla is very low i don't know what sla stands for could you let me know julio and i'm not i don't remember what i was doing when you said that and what that was related to maybe i was maybe that one out was when i was picking options for the uh for the storage bucket hey bobby says this is awesome thanks bobby ezekiel says hi hey ezekiel how's it going matt duchess says check out jesse's patreon and uh mad duchess thank you for being a patron i really appreciate that javier says is google storage the same as aws um okay so google cloud platform is the same as aws they're comparable uh so google storage would be comparable i think to s3 in aws so they're they're google storage is just a piece of google cloud platform so but yeah basically just with that little distinction i would say yeah they pretty much offer a lot of the same services eric is asking for thoughts on slash experience with magento 2. i have no experience with magento uh so i am sorry about that and i don't i don't know enough about it to even give uh any anything i mean it's a um uh that's what i'm looking for in an ecommerce platform right see i'm not even sure what it is i believe it's an ecommerce platform but that that's where my knowledge stops so i don't want to try to pretend and like i know what i'm talking about there if anybody else has any uh thoughts or experience with magento too please let eric know matt dutchess says i was first to donate because you rock jesse yeah for sure i was super excited when i saw that uh that was awesome so uh thank you i was um yesterday i wasn't at my computer for most of the day because it was memorial day here in the united states it's a national holiday so a lot of people don't have to work that day and so usually we have like picnics so my family i on my mom's side i have a really big family and they all live kind of in the same area so we had a you know outdoor picnic and it was a lot of fun but like i was getting notifications on my phone and trying to answer as best i could um and it was really sunny out so i'm trying to like shade my eyes so i can see my screen and but i saw that and i was just super excited uh so anyway thanks again matt duchess oh so that reminds me if any of you use a different name on youtube and you have a preference let me know whether you want me to call you by your real name or your youtube name i'm fine either way but i just want you to be comfortable with what i with what i say so if you have a preference let me know michael creole says one good thing about my stuttering connection is that i get blackmail blackmail worthy stills of jesse when the buffering occurs yeah um i i it might be fun to see some of those i'm a little bit scared to see someone but that might be funny there we go actually how about this one of my reward tiers on patreon will be you get access to all those uh blackmail worthy stills from the live streams uh cj says i'm new to free code camp and i just created my profile today all right uh congratulations on that and welcome to free code camp so there's so much there's so much to free code camp so definitely the core of free code camp is you know freecodecam.org and those lessons that's where it all started um those are super helpful uh to go through those but then there's so much supplementary material with the medium publication and the youtube videos and what else we have that like wikipedia type thing i can't remember what we call it uh it just has a wealth of information on a ton of different uh coding and tech related topics uh there's a forum i'm sure i'm probably missing something else that we do there's a newsletter uh but there's just so much so you know please take take advantage of all these free resources and uh it's it's definitely helped me to become a better uh better coder javier says lucky you get a sunny day we have a rainy day here uh at nc at nc is that north carolina or somewhere else okay it is north carolina all right cool yeah i thought it was gonna rain it it looked like it was gonna rain for a little bit and then it it cleared up and it was fine it was a really nice day it was warm kids were swimming uh so yeah it ended up being really nice i actually got some some sun you know i as a programmer i rarely get out right that's the stereotype but i was actually out in the sunlight yesterday i mean i got more sun yesterday than i had in like the last two weeks combined um all right cool so i've gotten to the bottom of the chat so let's see what time it is i don't know i'm kind of thinking maybe maybe i'll just we'll finish up here keep this stream on topic for once um and then yeah we'll see maybe i'll maybe we'll work on getting everything combined together like basically production ready uh tomorrow and i'm not sure i said before the launch date is june 4th uh but potentially it might get pushed back i don't really want it to get pushed back but it may be reasonable i had expected to have a little bit more help uh in terms of like data migration and cleaning up data then i did uh so my original estimates were based on that that help which i didn't have so we'll see we'll see how it goes i suppose it is better to launch it and have everything work than to try to rush it so i'm still going to try to do as much as i can before the fourth but we may not launch then either way i still would like to have all the the setup of the database and everything you know squared away all right cool oh harsh it's just back from dinner eating ice cream uh ice cream i've been on a diet for the last like month so ice cream sounds so good right now um all right thank you all so much for watching i really appreciate it i'm actually i'm really happy that everything went perfectly that rarely happens um i'm i'm really gonna try to be back tomorrow for a stream i do have some meetings tomorrow um i can't even remember what time they are i gotta check my calendar so i'll do my best to let everyone know early on in twitter and uh on instagram what time i'm gonna stream hopefully i can get it scheduled early so you all can get the notifications on youtube um yeah so until then uh have a great day and thanks again for watching
