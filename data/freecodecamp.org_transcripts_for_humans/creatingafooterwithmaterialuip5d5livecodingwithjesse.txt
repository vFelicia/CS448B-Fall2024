00:08 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:10 - with jesse
00:13 - um
00:14 - today
00:15 - we make a footer so
00:18 - we've completed
00:20 - well pretty much completed the header
00:23 - or the app bar
00:25 - the the drawer
00:28 - which is our side nav
00:31 - now we're going to move on to the footer
00:33 - i like to start with those things
00:34 - because they're going to be pretty much
00:36 - consistent across the entire site
00:39 - so i like to go with those first that
00:41 - gives us more time to look at it
00:43 - you know kind of
00:45 - perfect it you know it'll be tested more
00:48 - just by us looking at it
00:50 - you know constantly and
00:53 - as we're building out the rest of the
00:54 - site
00:56 - so
00:57 - the footer is probably the least
00:59 - important of those
01:01 - three components
01:04 - a lot of people won't even see the
01:05 - footer
01:06 - but it's still nice to have uh it's a
01:09 - place where you can put a lot of the
01:10 - links that you know especially with
01:13 - higher education there's a lot of
01:15 - regulations and things so
01:17 - uh you know we'll put
01:19 - privacy policy and different things like
01:22 - that you know down there at the bottom
01:23 - you gotta have them there but you don't
01:25 - really want to waste
01:26 - you know prying
01:28 - real estate at the top on things like
01:30 - that
01:31 - so basically we're going to make a
01:32 - footer that matches the colors of the
01:35 - university
01:37 - and has space
01:39 - you know for all those links at the
01:40 - bottom
01:41 - maybe um like an address it's nice to
01:44 - have an address there i think it's
01:45 - pretty common that people look
01:47 - um
01:48 - you know at the footer for contact
01:51 - information
01:53 - so that's the plan today
01:55 - i do have a sore throat so i've been
01:58 - taking zinc lozenges and um like cough
02:02 - drops and things
02:04 - so hopefully i have a cop dropping cough
02:06 - drop in right now so if i sound weird
02:08 - sorry it's the cough drop but
02:11 - i want to be able to get through the
02:12 - stream
02:14 - uh
02:15 - without my throat just
02:17 - getting crazy and me losing my voice
02:21 - the weird side effect is though my taste
02:23 - buds like totally don't work
02:26 - um
02:27 - i just tried to drink something and
02:31 - it it didn't taste at all like it
02:33 - normally tastes so
02:35 - anyway
02:37 - um
02:40 - miroslav says drink more tea actually i
02:42 - did have a cup of tea
02:44 - before the stream as well
02:46 - but the tea bag was really
02:48 - old i just found it laying in the bottom
02:51 - of one of my uh one of my drawers here
02:54 - and i thought why not i'll try it and so
02:57 - the tea was really really weak but
03:00 - anyway
03:02 - all right enough about
03:05 - my uh health problems and beverages
03:10 - let's get started um what did i do since
03:13 - the last time oh harshit
03:15 - harshit added end-to-end testing so we
03:17 - have some new testing so if you um
03:20 - have this repo running locally
03:23 - you'll see some new options for testing
03:27 - and
03:29 - i'm getting a weird okay let me show
03:32 - this now let me change my view here
03:35 - and show you this this error that i've
03:37 - been getting
03:42 - and see what you all think about it
03:45 - so
03:48 - check this out
03:51 - i keep getting this error now it's
03:53 - pretty uh self-explanatory it actually
03:56 - says
03:57 - check out this github repo to add this
04:00 - so i haven't added it yet i did check
04:02 - out the repo it seems pretty simple
04:06 - um
04:08 - so right now it's not it's not breaking
04:10 - anything it just brings up you know a
04:12 - million warnings like
04:16 - oh there's a lot of warnings here
04:18 - uh so you probably need to fix that
04:22 - i'll try it
04:24 - you know doing what it says in this repo
04:26 - first and then see how it goes
04:30 - uh i also think that i fixed the problem
04:32 - we were having where the um the styles
04:35 - just went all crazy and our fonts were
04:37 - um
04:39 - were just really huge
04:42 - so i went in and just
04:44 - there's an example in material ui's
04:48 - beta github repo
04:50 - for using material ui beta with
04:53 - next
04:55 - so i went through the um
04:57 - the appropriate files in that repository
05:00 - and then compared them to our files and
05:02 - i went through line by line our files
05:05 - are were almost identical
05:08 - they were really just
05:11 - two lines
05:12 - that were different so i changed those
05:15 - two lines
05:16 - to make them the same you could check it
05:18 - out it's it's my the last commit that i
05:20 - made i changed some some lines in there
05:23 - so
05:25 - since i've done that
05:26 - the problem has not happened again
05:30 - but i certainly haven't tested it
05:32 - thoroughly so we'll see
05:35 - if i don't see the problem
05:37 - you know at all for the rest of the day
05:40 - i'll be pretty confident that the
05:42 - problem has been fixed but it did seem
05:44 - like there were other people that were
05:45 - having that same problem or similar
05:47 - problems
05:49 - so
05:50 - i guess it's somewhat common
05:53 - all right oops i wanted to show you
05:55 - here's the footer that we have now
05:58 - this will give you a preview of kind of
06:00 - what it's going to look like
06:01 - so
06:02 - we're going to go with this green color
06:05 - i don't usually like having giant blocks
06:07 - of the green color but i think it's it's
06:09 - okay with the footer
06:11 - uh somewhat appropriate
06:14 - we'll have that gold border so it'll
06:16 - kind of match you know what we have
06:18 - going on here
06:21 - you know at the top here
06:23 - uh we'll have the same thing also i
06:25 - changed the background image
06:27 - so we've had the same background image
06:29 - for for a long time uh not just for this
06:32 - project but um
06:34 - i think did we use it for home test we
06:37 - did actually it's not showing up so at
06:38 - one point we were using it for that too
06:41 - so anyway i found this cute little pug
06:43 - dog
06:45 - and
06:47 - i might have to change it because it's
06:48 - just so cute i just want to look at it
06:50 - all the time i don't even want to code
06:51 - anymore
06:52 - um
06:53 - but anyway i thought that would be fun
06:55 - to look at
06:57 - my um
07:00 - my wife's parents have a little dog that
07:04 - looks pretty much just like this except
07:06 - their dog is way fatter than this dog
07:09 - um
07:11 - but uh it reminds me of that dog
07:15 - all right so here's what we're gonna do
07:16 - we'll have our regular green color here
07:19 - and then a slightly darker shade of that
07:21 - color down here for kind of like the
07:24 - the sub footer i don't know what you'd
07:26 - really call it
07:27 - um
07:29 - we're gonna have our our copyright stuff
07:32 - and then all these links
07:35 - for all the kind of legal stuff that we
07:37 - need
07:38 - and uh i think i'll just i'll keep this
07:40 - set up for now
07:44 - and uh if we want to change it later we
07:45 - can
07:47 - uh but it would be good if somebody
07:49 - happens to get to the bottom of the page
07:50 - then you know why not give them an apply
07:52 - button and donate button again
07:55 - since uh that's what we
07:58 - that's what we expect to be the main
08:00 - actions that someone would take and the
08:02 - main things that we
08:04 - want them to do when they get to this
08:05 - site primarily apply but then also
08:08 - potentially donate
08:10 - depending on whether they're a
08:11 - prospective student or not
08:14 - all right so that's the plan
08:16 - uh this was done
08:20 - i believe we we use material ui for this
08:23 - so we can't just grab all the code we
08:26 - can grab some of it
08:29 - um
08:31 - yeah some of it like
08:32 - basically the content i guess
08:37 - i'm pretty sure material ui does not
08:39 - have any
08:40 - type of pre-made footer at least they
08:43 - didn't the last time i checked which
08:45 - wasn't that long ago
08:46 - so
08:48 - these are the components we have so far
08:51 - probably what we need to do what we
08:53 - ought to do is maybe just use their um
08:58 - their grid system
09:01 - to build this out
09:03 - so that's my plan
09:05 - if anybody
09:06 - you know has has used material ui and
09:09 - and
09:10 - has done something like this and knows
09:11 - of a better way to do this maybe more
09:13 - simple let me know otherwise
09:16 - uh let's start out by checking out the
09:18 - grid
09:20 - let's see layouts let's check out this
09:23 - grid
09:27 - so we're going to be using a grid
09:28 - component
09:30 - and
09:32 - this is
09:40 - there we go so we'll have these um
09:52 - let's see
09:55 - we can
09:57 - auto layout we can exactly shift
10:00 - available space
10:03 - okay uh so i guess we'll go with this um
10:10 - full width
10:12 - that seems like that'll fit our use case
10:16 - um
10:21 - yeah let's just copy
10:24 - two classes we have going on here
10:26 - yeah we're we're good
10:28 - um
10:34 - let's grab this grid
10:38 - we'll just grab the whole thing
10:41 - and then
10:43 - we'll get rid of what we don't need
10:53 - okay
10:56 - um let's go over oops almost forgot to
10:59 - set the timer
11:01 - uh so
11:02 - we're going to do
11:03 - we're going to break up the stream into
11:05 - 25 minute periods and that'll be broken
11:08 - up by five minute periods in between
11:13 - so
11:14 - 25 minutes of code five minutes of
11:16 - question and answer we'll try to get two
11:18 - sessions in today and then i'll do
11:20 - question and answer after that
11:24 - uh also i see there's a lot of activity
11:26 - in the live chat so um
11:30 - i'll come back to that if you've asked a
11:32 - question already
11:33 - after this 25 minute session i'm gonna
11:36 - come back and go through everything
11:38 - that's already been in the live chat
11:42 - um
11:43 - i see in general a lot of you are just
11:45 - saying hi
11:46 - uh and uh
11:49 - hey everybody
11:54 - actually someone arivan says say hello
11:57 - to us from brazil so i will do that hey
11:59 - um hey everybody in brazil
12:02 - uh everything thanks for watching
12:07 - okay
12:09 - let's copy that and we'll go over to
12:14 - we definitely want to make this its own
12:15 - component
12:18 - so
12:18 - let's go here in components and
12:21 - make a new file
12:25 - we'll call this footer.js
12:31 - for now i'm going to put everything in
12:33 - this footer component but it's possible
12:35 - that we may want to
12:37 - refactor a bit and extract out
12:40 - you know some of what's going to be in
12:42 - the footer component in it
12:45 - that we'll do in this stream extract
12:46 - some of that out
12:48 - and make it into its own components
12:50 - we'll see how large it gets
12:53 - usually i don't like to have really
12:55 - large components uh if if it's avoidable
12:58 - and usually is avoidable
13:01 - all right so let's um
13:08 - actually let's just grab
13:13 - something here
13:16 - this is really big let me grab
13:19 - the drawer is that smaller
13:21 - yeah this looks smaller
13:22 - let's grab this drawer first
13:30 - yeah let's grab the drawer
13:33 - and
13:34 - let's paste that
13:37 - and then
13:39 - that'll save us some time
13:43 - now
13:46 - let's get rid of all this stuff
13:51 - and paste that in
13:54 - and
13:59 - actually we might be able to just keep
14:01 - grid here so let's let's take out drawer
14:04 - as well
14:05 - let's see what it'll look like with just
14:07 - grid
14:09 - let's get rid of some of this stuff
14:11 - and get rid of this
14:16 - footer
14:17 - and let's change this to footer
14:23 - i don't think we need state
14:27 - but we will need
14:32 - we're going to put one function in here
14:35 - and i'm not going to do it yet we'll
14:36 - save it for a little while later
14:40 - um toggle we don't need toggle drawer we
14:43 - don't need to open
14:48 - and
14:50 - let's see
14:51 - this is full nested function we don't
14:52 - need any of these
14:56 - let's grab
15:01 - let's see what we need really search
15:02 - icon button
15:04 - divider
15:07 - we get rid of all of these
15:10 - and this
15:13 - and that
15:19 - and we're not actually using the prop
15:21 - types right now
15:24 - i don't think we'll have any props to be
15:26 - honest with you
15:28 - um
15:30 - well i guess
15:32 - we'll still have the classes
15:34 - did we even have that in the prop types
15:35 - before
15:38 - no we didn't okay so we don't need those
15:40 - either
15:42 - great
15:43 - so now this is looking
15:44 - a lot smaller which is nice
15:51 - and
15:52 - let's see what kind of grid we need so
15:54 - we'll need
15:57 - let's do it like this
16:02 - so definitely we want
16:04 - small
16:09 - let's change this to
16:12 - i'm assuming this is a 12 column system
16:14 - i guess i'll find out in a minute
16:16 - um
16:17 - so if it's a 12 column system i want to
16:19 - change this to be four columns each
16:25 - on a small screen
16:28 - i just want to get some on here so we
16:29 - can see most likely going to be
16:31 - adjusting this at some point and then i
16:33 - would like this to be 12 all the time
16:37 - and that's going to be our bottom
16:39 - our bottom bar there
16:41 - and then we don't need any of these
16:47 - so
16:49 - all right one two three four yep that's
16:51 - what i want
16:53 - glasses paper oh let's get the styles in
16:55 - there
17:06 - you know what i didn't add that root
17:10 - i don't want to add that
17:20 - let's add this uh
17:22 - root um
17:24 - like we have in the example
17:28 - it says
17:31 - class name classes
17:40 - yeah let's add that in
17:44 - may we may not need it but
17:47 - the closer we get to the example the
17:49 - less likely we are to have any problems
17:53 - okay
17:54 - so not bad let's see okay so we do have
17:57 - some text in here
18:00 - i'll leave that in there for now just so
18:02 - we can see it
18:04 - and
18:12 - that looks alright
18:14 - so i'm going to save that and then let's
18:16 - go to our layout component
18:20 - and let's put in
18:23 - below
18:24 - below this part
18:26 - we're going to put in our
18:28 - footer
18:32 - and then we need to import our footer as
18:34 - well
18:36 - so i'm just going to copy what we have
18:38 - here for drawer
18:39 - and then i
18:40 - can
18:42 - put in footer
18:45 - i'm going to save that
18:46 - let's see if we've done anything
18:50 - ah we didn't import grid
18:53 - i'll see when i read the live chat if
18:55 - anybody caught that
19:00 - i thought i had everything okay
19:03 - so let's see
19:07 - let's grab something here
19:12 - make it easier
19:15 - divider and we'll change this to grid
19:21 - and while we're at it let's double check
19:23 - to make sure you don't have anything
19:24 - else in your paper okay so we'll
19:26 - probably need to import paper
19:39 - all right so grid and paper
19:42 - and i think that'll do it
19:48 - yay okay
19:50 - awesome so we have down here at the
19:51 - bottom
19:52 - full width
19:54 - we have our
19:56 - three
19:58 - uh across here like we wanted and then
20:00 - one
20:01 - below obviously this isn't you know this
20:04 - is not how we want it styled but it's
20:06 - just
20:07 - um
20:09 - just the first step in here so
20:12 - at this point
20:14 - we want to do for sure a few things
20:17 - that container that we put in if you
20:18 - remember that that that div that we
20:20 - wrapped everything in i'm kind of glad i
20:23 - did that now because
20:25 - it'll be good to have a wrapper
20:26 - component so that
20:28 - what we'll do is that wrapper component
20:31 - will put our background color of green
20:34 - that hash that's um 21412a
20:37 - um the hex color
20:40 - we'll put that as the background color
20:42 - on that
20:43 - and then
20:45 - we'll put our border on that as well of
20:48 - course we'll take out all these paper
20:49 - styles we'll remove the paper component
20:51 - completely we don't need that
20:54 - and then at the bottom here we'll make
20:56 - sure that there's nothing here no
20:58 - padding margin anything like that so
21:00 - this is flat on the bottom but on this
21:03 - we'll put a background
21:07 - that's just going to be black
21:11 - but it's going to be transparent
21:14 - so it'll show the green behind it but
21:16 - it'll darken it slightly
21:20 - so i think that'll work so
21:22 - for now
21:23 - i'm not going to worry about content
21:24 - let's worry about getting the colors and
21:26 - the positioning down then we can worry
21:29 - about throwing in some of that content
21:33 - all right we got 15 minutes to do this i
21:35 - think we're definitely gonna at least
21:36 - get that part done and then the second
21:37 - pomodoro session uh will probably be
21:40 - where we throw in some links
21:42 - and uh and some of that content
21:46 - okay
21:47 - so we're gonna get rid of paper we don't
21:49 - need that
21:51 - and
21:52 - we also don't need these styles for
21:54 - paper
21:56 - but our roots now we're gonna put a
21:59 - background
22:02 - color
22:04 - of and let me grab
22:08 - let's grab this color
22:10 - here there we go
22:14 - okay so we have our um
22:17 - the color that i'd like to use is
22:19 - already in
22:20 - our theme
22:22 - our material ui custom theme so we're
22:25 - going to use that when we do it like
22:26 - that it allows us then to go back in
22:28 - later on and we can change our primary
22:30 - color and not have to go and change it
22:32 - in every component
22:34 - works basically just like sas variables
22:36 - do
22:39 - i mean not like the inner functioning of
22:41 - it
22:43 - but in terms of being able to change it
22:44 - in one place and have it change
22:46 - everywhere uh it's similar to how the
22:49 - sas variables are
22:50 - okay so we got the background color
22:53 - there we go
22:54 - and we're going to give it a border
23:06 - top
23:07 - and it's gonna be
23:15 - you know what i don't think i can do it
23:16 - like this
23:22 - let me try it like this but i'm almost
23:23 - positive i've tried to do it before and
23:25 - it didn't work so let's try uh border
23:27 - top
23:28 - solid
23:30 - three pixels and then where's our gold
23:33 - color
23:35 - i thought i had it over here
23:38 - and our style guide
23:44 - i have the style guide open somewhere
23:45 - but i don't know where it is so i'm just
23:46 - gonna
23:47 - open it up again
23:50 - i guess i already had that
23:55 - already using it in the at bar component
23:57 - so i could have just grabbed it from
23:58 - there
24:06 - let's see
24:12 - and we need to remove all of these paper
24:16 - uh elements here
24:21 - read this
24:25 - and this as well
24:32 - okay
24:37 - and let's see how that works for now
24:41 - let's go with um
24:43 - let's add one more style and we're going
24:45 - to say this let's call this sub footer
24:53 - and that's going to be that bottom
24:54 - footer
24:57 - and let's put background
25:00 - background color here
25:02 - and
25:03 - let's go with r
25:05 - g b a
25:07 - and we want
25:10 - 2 5 5 2 5 5 2 5 5.
25:15 - um and then let's go with a point
25:19 - zero point
25:22 - one
25:23 - let's see how dark that gets us here
25:27 - okay
25:29 - and let's add that to this bottom one
25:31 - here
25:34 - and so we'll go
25:39 - class
25:40 - name classes
25:43 - sub footer
25:45 - okay
25:47 - save that
25:49 - oh
25:50 - not bad check it out
25:52 - okay so it looks like we have
25:58 - not not perfect here but
26:02 - oh
26:04 - all right so we do have some weird stuff
26:06 - going on
26:08 - we have a little bit of a problem i
26:10 - guess with um
26:12 - being able to scroll over a bit
26:14 - so
26:16 - we'll sort that out at a different time
26:18 - i don't want to get
26:19 - distracted by that right now
26:24 - it looks like that that's affecting
26:25 - everything
26:27 - um
26:28 - yeah but not bad so we have a border so
26:31 - evidently this did work
26:33 - um i don't know what i did last time
26:35 - maybe i'm remembering wrong but looks
26:38 - like that worked awesome
26:39 - uh let's see so put her back
26:46 - interesting
26:48 - all right well let's just put in
26:51 - some
26:53 - some content uh just to get an idea of
26:56 - how it looks so for now i think i'm just
26:58 - gonna put in
27:00 - i'm just gonna put in some divs
27:04 - actually not even that let's just put in
27:05 - some p tags with some lorem ipsum in it
27:11 - don't i have low room
27:19 - i used to have lower mipsum that just
27:21 - popped up
27:24 - guess not
27:26 - all right let's grab some
27:29 - laura mipsum text
27:53 - and
27:54 - i'm going to use
27:56 - bacon ipsum
28:06 - and let's see what that gives us
28:25 - let's see what we have going on here
28:34 - so
28:36 - we have
28:46 - oh goodness
28:48 - i put the uh the wrong um hex
28:52 - wrong colors here
28:53 - uh
28:55 - i'm afraid to check the live chat and
28:57 - see who called me out on that
28:59 - [Music]
29:05 - let's try it like this
29:11 - there we go
29:12 - so i
29:14 - instead of doing black
29:16 - with
29:17 - a transparent black i did a transparent
29:20 - white
29:21 - so anyway
29:23 - i usually never do that by hand
29:26 - i always
29:27 - copy it from somewhere or
29:31 - use the color picker and dev tools
29:37 - okay
29:38 - cool not bad that's that's pretty much
29:40 - exactly what we want
29:44 - i could probably stand to go with a
29:45 - little bit darker color here
29:48 - let's increase this and do a 1.5 or 0.15
29:52 - see how that looks
29:57 - i like that i like that much better
30:00 - okay
30:02 - and
30:04 - that border looks very thin
30:10 - i'm thinking it's not going to work so
30:12 - it works up here i don't want a huge
30:14 - thick border up here and it works it's
30:17 - it's subtle
30:19 - but that's what i want down here
30:23 - we'll leave it like that for now
30:26 - see what i think about it but
30:29 - it may have to make that maybe just one
30:31 - pixel thicker
30:34 - all right let's check my time here wow
30:36 - six minutes okay
30:42 - all right well let's put in some um
30:45 - some text
30:48 - and so we could use the material ui
30:52 - typography component so i guess let's
30:55 - let's check it out
31:01 - it's not here
31:08 - am i missing this
31:15 - style there we go typography
31:35 - all right let's check it out
31:52 - okay so let's try to use typography and
31:55 - maybe give it a um
31:58 - what's the default the defaults body one
32:00 - so we'll just leave it
32:01 - uh blank so we get a default on there
32:04 - and
32:08 - for color
32:15 - actually i don't even know what our
32:16 - secondary set at
32:18 - default we're going to want this to be
32:20 - white
32:29 - okay
32:32 - so for now let's just go in and use
32:36 - typography instead of these p tags
32:45 - oops
32:47 - it's not i wanted to do it
32:49 - like this
32:51 - there we go
32:59 - typography and then we need to bring in
33:01 - typography up here
33:13 - all right let's see if it works
33:16 - did i miss something
33:23 - i didn't really see much of a change
33:33 - let's see what we have
33:40 - let's see what
33:41 - we can do here classes usually stylify
33:45 - the components
33:47 - well let's add a color here
33:56 - footer text and let's go color
34:01 - and let's give it
34:04 - oops
34:08 - okay
34:09 - give it that color we're gonna go font
34:12 - size
34:14 - 16 pixels
34:21 - uh and so then on these typography
34:25 - no
34:26 - just on the first ones
34:29 - we're going to get
34:30 - class
34:32 - name
34:36 - classes
34:39 - let me call this footer
34:45 - footer text
34:48 - all right
34:51 - see what happens
34:54 - oh footer text oops
34:57 - i'm always forgetting the commas here
35:08 - okay awesome so
35:11 - we've got the white text
35:14 - let's check yep we got our font size we
35:17 - wanted uh 16.
35:19 - i may want to make that bigger for the
35:21 - top section
35:23 - leave it smaller down here
35:29 - i think i do i don't know about you but
35:30 - that just looks really small
35:33 - let's bump that up then
35:35 - to 18 and see what it looks like
35:41 - yeah that's that's better
35:44 - [Music]
35:47 - change the line height as well
35:59 - okay
36:04 - all right cool
36:06 - um
36:08 - we definitely need some
36:10 - some padding right
36:13 - need some padding on the sides
36:17 - top and bottom
36:24 - so let's do that for here we can put
36:29 - let's just put some general
36:37 - so we need padding and uh we need our
36:40 - top padding to be
36:42 - let's try eight first we might have to
36:44 - go with 16. so we're gonna go eight
36:48 - and
36:49 - on the sides we are gonna go 16
36:53 - and 16 and we're going to go 16 on the
36:56 - sides especially because we have that
36:58 - scroll bar to deal with
37:02 - and then we'll do 16 on both sides be
37:04 - just to be consistent and then the
37:06 - bottom i want it to be zero for right
37:08 - now because remember we have that
37:10 - section with that different cut
37:11 - background
37:12 - color so
37:14 - we don't want to
37:17 - add padding there because that's going
37:19 - to push that section up and there'll be
37:21 - a small stripe of our original base
37:24 - color so we don't want that so we're
37:26 - going to put the padding directly on
37:28 - that sub footer
37:32 - so padding
37:34 - bottom and
37:37 - that's where we'll have
37:41 - uh
37:42 - eight yeah let's give it eight pixels on
37:44 - the bottom
37:47 - and
37:48 - we want um to push it up
37:52 - push the content up above it right so we
37:54 - have the the
37:56 - padding covered everywhere else except
37:58 - for there
38:00 - so let's do a margin
38:04 - top
38:06 - and
38:08 - first we'll try out
38:09 - 8 pixels and we'll go from there
38:12 - right we want to do a margin and not
38:15 - padding because we did padding top that
38:17 - would make the entire section color
38:20 - included get bigger we don't want that
38:23 - so
38:24 - that's why we went with margin
38:27 - let's save that and see what
38:30 - happens huh
38:33 - okay so we we got a little bit of
38:38 - let's inspect this we got a little bit
38:40 - of what we wanted but not
38:42 - not everything we wanted
38:46 - so we have our padding here
38:49 - so check out that padding
38:53 - whoa
38:55 - and then our margin
39:02 - okay 12.
39:11 - looks like we already had some padding
39:12 - going on there by default
39:15 - so maybe we won't need to do that
39:20 - but i do like the uh the margin
39:24 - all right so let's stop right there
39:26 - because my timer is up i'm going to take
39:28 - a short break now go over some questions
39:30 - in the live chat and then we'll come
39:32 - back and we'll mess around a little bit
39:33 - more with our margin and padding
39:37 - so scroll all the way up
39:40 - and
39:45 - i'll try to get through as much as i can
39:46 - there's quite a bit here in the live
39:48 - chat so we'll see how it goes
39:56 - uh
39:56 - jimmy says hi i'm new hey how's it going
39:59 - uh welcome to the uh welcome to the the
40:03 - live stream
40:04 - and uh feel free to ask any questions uh
40:06 - or put comments in the chat i'd love to
40:09 - hear your opinion on things
40:20 - okay jimmy had asked does does this dude
40:23 - reply so
40:24 - not sure if you're still here jimmy
40:26 - sorry i didn't see that but uh i did
40:28 - explain it earlier hopefully you stuck
40:30 - around and got the explanation that
40:33 - i will i do reply to things in the live
40:35 - chat but during the
40:37 - the breaks that i take to go to the live
40:38 - chat i did try before to
40:41 - you know try to monitor the live chat
40:44 - while i'm coding and uh it ended up
40:48 - not being so good
40:50 - it took forever to code anything
40:53 - and um yeah so i can't can't do that
41:02 - thank you uh for everyone who's giving
41:05 - me suggestions on what to take uh for my
41:07 - sore throat uh
41:10 - i i really appreciate that
41:15 - uh erivon asks what operating system do
41:18 - you guys use to code
41:20 - i'm on mac os right now
41:23 - i almost exclusively use mac to code
41:27 - my servers are usually ubuntu
41:30 - linux
41:31 - and i do have pcs at home but i don't
41:35 - code on them often i
41:37 - i just use them for gaming
41:45 - okay horseshit asked about the end and
41:47 - testing if it works on my machine yes it
41:50 - did work
41:51 - um so
41:52 - yeah it worked it worked perfectly
41:55 - well with the exception of those errors
41:57 - that were on there but that's not due to
41:59 - the testing those errors showed up
42:00 - before i merged your pull request so
42:03 - uh but the the end end testing itself uh
42:06 - worked perfectly so thank you for that
42:08 - hardship
42:12 - rook said that picture is the best the
42:14 - dog yeah that's such a cute dog i want
42:17 - to like get rid of this text now so i
42:18 - could see this dog better
42:28 - oh cool so a heart should ask if we
42:30 - could if i could demo the end end
42:33 - testing yeah so let's do that so
42:35 - i'm going to go yarn
42:36 - test
42:38 - and uh if you have the most the
42:40 - up-to-date version of this on your local
42:43 - machine when you
42:45 - uh when you pull
42:47 - the latest make sure you run yarn to
42:49 - install all the new npm packages
42:52 - but then after you've done that you can
42:54 - type yarn test
42:56 - and we'll see
42:59 - our tests running so those tests passed
43:03 - those were unit tests
43:05 - now this is our end-to-end test so you
43:07 - see it actually did the testing in the
43:09 - browser
43:11 - which is awesome and we can see it even
43:14 - gives us uh
43:16 - timing in milliseconds
43:18 - so
43:19 - really cool
43:22 - if anybody's interested in testing or
43:24 - learning more about it or if you know
43:26 - about it and would like to get some more
43:27 - practice
43:28 - you know feel free to add to the test
43:31 - that we already have on there and then
43:33 - as we add new components if you'd like
43:35 - to write tests for them you know that
43:37 - would be
43:38 - very helpful um
43:41 - i'm still pretty new with testing so
43:42 - i'll do my best to uh
43:44 - keep up to date when we add new
43:46 - components but
43:49 - to to be honest if i'm really like if i
43:52 - have a lot to do the testing is gonna
43:54 - get put off
43:56 - uh that's just i am working on a few
43:58 - other projects right now so
44:01 - i may not be able to put in the time
44:03 - that i i ought to on that
44:13 - uh jesse says uh jesse mcintyre says
44:16 - that pick is awesome philip says i hope
44:19 - the pick is production ready
44:23 - jesse says it's way too distracting
44:31 - yeah as soon as i saw that picture i
44:33 - knew like i have to have this on here
44:38 - okay uh so didn't get through everything
44:40 - in the chat right now but i will after
44:43 - this next pomodoro session
44:51 - so
44:52 - i took a note of where i'm at in the
44:54 - live chat i'll go right back to where i
44:56 - left off uh after the next session
45:01 - and
45:02 - let's see
45:10 - okay
45:11 - all right so
45:12 - we put in some padding and things but it
45:15 - didn't exactly work like i expected it
45:17 - to so
45:20 - let's check out what's going on
45:22 - is it this
45:23 - i might have to pull this over a bit
45:26 - um
45:28 - okay
45:30 - so our footer
45:47 - is supposed to have
45:52 - all right i need to do something else
45:54 - with this
45:56 - let's do it like this
45:58 - um
45:58 - let's take this and dock it to the
46:01 - bottom
46:02 - and
46:03 - let's make this full screen
46:07 - all right
46:08 - so when i do it like this unfortunately
46:10 - i won't be able to make this very much
46:11 - bigger we'd never be able to see
46:12 - anything
46:15 - and also i realize that this section is
46:17 - now covered up
46:19 - but i will do my best to
46:22 - talk about what's going on
46:25 - all right so what we have here that i'm
46:28 - i'm wondering about is we should have
46:31 - padding top
46:33 - left
46:35 - oh goodness it was my mistake i messed
46:37 - it up uh i'm sure you all noticed this
46:40 - already we're mad here
46:46 - all right let's um
46:48 - arrange this a bit better
46:50 - there we go
46:51 - okay so
46:53 - unfortunately i don't know what happened
46:55 - to my brain for a second but this is not
46:58 - how you do positioning
47:01 - so
47:03 - the correct order is
47:04 - top
47:07 - right
47:08 - bottom
47:09 - left
47:12 - why why i didn't remember that at the
47:14 - moment i have no idea but that was our
47:16 - problem so you can see now
47:19 - we have
47:21 - uh our eight or was it eight or sixteen
47:24 - yes sixteen pixels
47:27 - of padding on both sides here
47:30 - and
47:32 - eight at the top
47:34 - at the bottom
47:36 - our container has nothing in terms of
47:38 - padding oh goodness
47:41 - i didn't even think about this but we
47:42 - can't do that right because then we're
47:44 - going to have these little spots here
47:47 - let's fix that
47:50 - so
47:51 - here's what we need to do
47:54 - we have these these grid items here
47:57 - we'll need to put
47:59 - our padding
48:00 - directly into these
48:04 - we can keep top the top padding here
48:08 - so let's do
48:10 - padding top
48:11 - and how did that look
48:14 - okay i think we can go 16 for the
48:16 - padding top so let's do that
48:20 - and then we're going to make
48:27 - let's see footer text
48:31 - let's just go footer
48:34 - footer sections
48:37 - and let's say padding
48:40 - for footer sections and we'll give
48:46 - a we're going to give them padding of
48:53 - zero
48:54 - for the top and bottom and then for left
48:57 - and right let's give them 16.
49:01 - we'll see how this looks
49:03 - it may be too much
49:05 - between sections but uh it's worth a
49:08 - shot
49:10 - so let's put in here
49:13 - in these grids
49:16 - so just those first three
49:19 - class name
49:21 - we're going to say
49:23 - classes
49:25 - dot footer
49:28 - sections
49:31 - great
49:33 - all right now let's see what it looks
49:35 - like
49:36 - and
49:38 - i forgot my comma again
49:43 - goodness
49:46 - i need to get like a little jar on my
49:48 - desk and uh
49:50 - i'll like every time i forget a comma
49:52 - i'll have to put a coin in the jar and
49:54 - then it can go to like some charity or
49:56 - something but then i'll learn my lesson
50:01 - to quit forgetting
50:08 - that didn't work like i wanted it to
50:10 - but i'll learn my lesson to quit for
50:12 - getting the
50:14 - commas in javascript arrays
50:18 - all right let's see
50:20 - here's a grid item
50:24 - oops you know what our padding is being
50:26 - overridden
50:40 - that's fine let's go with a margin
50:43 - instead
50:48 - i don't think we have a margin on any of
50:50 - these yet no no margin but margins will
50:52 - work in this case so
50:54 - yeah let's not try to fight what's
50:55 - already there we'll just switch it up to
50:57 - a margin
51:04 - no
51:07 - all right
51:08 - let's try this let's try to use what's
51:11 - already built in here
51:15 - oh man
51:29 - so
51:41 - okay
51:42 - how about we'll do this
51:45 - let's see if this works
51:49 - instead of putting it on these grid
51:51 - components
51:54 - whoops didn't grab it all
52:00 - instead of the grid components we're
52:02 - going to put these
52:05 - on typography
52:08 - how do we do this
52:10 - can i just do a comma
52:14 - oh goodness no i
52:16 - can't see if i can do a comma
52:20 - classes.
52:24 - footer sections
52:25 - i think i can do that
52:32 - no i can't
52:53 - uh let's oops
53:01 - let's see if that works
53:04 - yeah there we go i need
53:07 - i need to make it an array
53:10 - and then it will work
53:18 - okay
53:19 - all right awesome so we finally got what
53:22 - we wanted that took way longer than
53:24 - expected
53:25 - uh but it's not overall not bad i think
53:28 - we're making pretty quick progress
53:31 - uh
53:33 - and did i find it yes okay i found the
53:36 - issue
53:37 - uh can you all see that here's what's
53:39 - causing
53:40 - our
53:42 - i literally have my face like a few
53:44 - inches away from the screen right now
53:46 - so uh i don't know if you could all see
53:48 - that
53:49 - yeah it's right uh uh right here
53:52 - in the corner the bottom
53:54 - uh right hand corner
53:57 - our
53:59 - our shadow
54:01 - right
54:02 - is not a shadow but you know our
54:04 - i guess our overlay
54:07 - is extending out you know past this
54:10 - so
54:14 - that's where our issue is where we're
54:16 - getting this little section on the sides
54:18 - we definitely don't want that
54:22 - so why is this extending out
54:27 - when
54:28 - oh goodness our grid our grids extending
54:31 - out as well
54:35 - so all of our great items are extending
54:37 - out
54:39 - we don't want that
54:59 - hmm
55:13 - so
55:27 - hmm
55:34 - okay so it's has to do with what's going
55:37 - on here
55:44 - all right
55:45 - let's re uh reload that just to get rid
55:48 - of what i did
56:24 - oh let's
56:26 - continue spacing
56:28 - all right let's check out our grid
56:33 - stuff
56:39 - what's the spacing
57:07 - hmm
57:34 - okay this is our problem here so
57:37 - this is exactly what's happening let me
57:40 - zoom in on that a bit
57:42 - uh so
57:44 - you probably couldn't see this
57:46 - in dev tools because the the
57:48 - it was too small and i think it was
57:50 - covered up by the um
57:52 - by the video
57:54 - feed of my face
57:56 - but there's a negative margin
57:59 - and that's how they're getting this to
58:01 - work so it's the the official width of
58:04 - this grid is
58:06 - 100 of the screen plus 24 pixels and
58:09 - then there's a negative margin all
58:11 - around of negative 12 pixels
58:14 - um
58:16 - so let's see not using the spacing
58:19 - feature and implementing it in user
58:22 - space
58:23 - adding a padding on the parent with at
58:26 - least the spacing
58:34 - value adding overflow x hidden on the
58:38 - parent
58:40 - actually
58:41 - if this works this will be the easiest
58:43 - way let's try it
58:46 - we can try it oops right here in dev
58:48 - tools
58:51 - so the parent
58:53 - would be this so
58:55 - let's go with
58:59 - overflow x
59:02 - hidden
59:06 - all right cool that solves the problem
59:09 - um
59:10 - awesome so we're going to add this here
59:13 - so our root component is our parent and
59:15 - we're going to say
59:18 - we're gonna remember a comma this time
59:22 - overflow x
59:25 - hidden
59:27 - save that
59:28 - and
59:29 - all right
59:31 - so now we don't have our horizontal
59:33 - scroll
59:35 - wonderful
59:38 - we still have what do we have going on
59:40 - here
59:44 - what happened to our
59:49 - our top
59:54 - hmm
59:59 - goodness
60:56 - yeah i want to do this too
60:57 - all right so i'm going to take off the
61:00 - spacing
61:01 - or i think the example said set it to
61:04 - zero i'm going to take that off as well
61:06 - because that's seems like it's
61:07 - complicating
61:10 - a lot of what's going on here
61:19 - so let's check
61:20 - okay good so our padding is now
61:24 - working properly
61:30 - great
61:32 - okay
61:35 - okay
61:36 - great
61:43 - okay
61:44 - that seems to work so um
61:47 - so what we ended up doing then
61:50 - is uh
61:52 - there's this
61:53 - built-in spacing
61:55 - uh property that you can use with the
61:57 - grid container uh component
62:01 - and
62:03 - it was
62:05 - it was kind of messing up what we were
62:07 - trying to do
62:08 - you know manually with our styles here
62:11 - so i just got rid of that
62:14 - i know it's easier for me just to work
62:16 - with the css or the css and js directly
62:21 - uh then to try to figure out
62:23 - you know what i'm what i'm doing here
62:25 - because i know exactly what i want
62:27 - with this
62:29 - footer component
62:31 - so i think it's just going to be a lot
62:32 - faster to do it like this
62:36 - all right let me check my time seven
62:37 - minutes all right
62:43 - okay so let's get some stuff here in
62:45 - this sub footer
62:47 - and
62:51 - yeah that'll be all we
62:54 - will do
62:57 - let's find our example
63:00 - okay yes we just have the copyright
63:03 - and these links
63:15 - let me grab this
63:19 - and for this
63:21 - i want to put a
63:24 - span
63:30 - and within that
63:32 - this is going to be
63:43 - this dot
63:48 - get here
63:50 - and up here
63:53 - we're gonna have
63:55 - get here
63:59 - and
64:01 - this will be
64:08 - what is it
64:10 - i always have to lift this up
64:12 - uh
64:16 - i wonder if we're doing that here
64:18 - already i think we are
64:35 - okay so we just need to get
64:38 - let's say this
64:42 - const
64:44 - uh
64:45 - date
64:48 - today equals new
64:51 - date
64:53 - and then
64:55 - we'll say
65:03 - return
65:04 - i'm going to return
65:08 - date
65:10 - today
65:18 - dot
65:19 - get full year
65:26 - all right
65:33 - all right let's see if that works
65:39 - what do we get yep no it didn't work
66:12 - all right let's see what comes up here
66:23 - so this afternoon components
66:36 - all right what did i do
67:17 - you're still getting it
67:24 - class name looks like
67:35 - and two errors let's see just 44.
67:40 - let's check the first one
67:47 - saying i'm giving it an invalid
67:50 - prop
67:54 - but it's working
68:16 - all right so it's just a prop type thing
68:25 - now this one
68:29 - i'm pretty sure we've done this before
68:31 - in react
68:32 - yeah we have
68:34 - right
68:41 - maybe we haven't
68:45 - uh
68:52 - is this not working
69:18 - hmm
69:22 - okay
69:27 - let me just skip that right now
69:29 - for some reason i'm just not seeing what
69:31 - the problem is i'm sure it's just
69:33 - something silly that i'm forgetting to
69:34 - do or doing wrong
69:36 - um
69:43 - let's
69:46 - we need a little bit of padding here
69:56 - a little bit more than we currently have
69:59 - let's see
70:02 - adding bottom
70:05 - margins up
70:07 - actually yeah we don't have any padding
70:08 - right now so
70:10 - let's add some
70:14 - adding top and let's go with eight
70:17 - pixels on the top
70:20 - good so we have eight on the top eight
70:22 - on the bottom
70:24 - it's pretty slim
70:27 - might have to increase the padding a bit
70:29 - but i i kind of like to have it a little
70:32 - bit more slim i think it looks nicer
70:35 - okay not bad so let's add that padding
70:37 - on the top
70:39 - and that'll be the last thing that we do
70:41 - for uh for this stream in terms of
70:43 - coding
70:48 - let's see you know what we need some
70:50 - padding on the sides as well
70:52 - so
70:53 - let's go ahead and just change
70:56 - our sub footer instead of doing a
70:58 - padding bottom we're just going to do
70:59 - padding
71:00 - and we'll go with that
71:02 - top of 8 pixels
71:06 - and then left and right of 16
71:09 - and bottom of zero since we already have
71:12 - padding on the entire thing
71:15 - wait did we
71:16 - no we didn't
71:18 - are we getting that padding on the
71:20 - bottom
71:32 - oh i had it
71:33 - separately
71:37 - how did i have that stuff for this
71:48 - somehow i had padding bottom on there
71:52 - i'm not sure how
71:53 - okay um
71:55 - let's add eight pixels then and then 16
72:00 - pixels
72:03 - sorry everybody i'm starting a little
72:05 - bit of a headache so i'm just kind of i
72:08 - don't know if i'm making a lot of sense
72:09 - at this point but
72:10 - in general we're getting done what we
72:12 - want to get done okay that looks good we
72:14 - have our
72:16 - the right amount of padding
72:20 - okay
72:21 - all right not bad so
72:23 - uh you know we have
72:26 - you know let's just compare a bit
72:28 - let me get rid of this
72:30 - and uh we'll compare so we have them
72:32 - side by side here
72:34 - uh this is what we are going for
72:37 - and so that looks
72:40 - okay now forget content-wise because i'm
72:42 - not worried about content right now
72:45 - but just in terms of design
72:49 - we basically matched it right we've gone
72:52 - with a little bit thinner subfooter
72:54 - um
72:56 - a little bit thinner of our
72:59 - our top border
73:02 - but
73:04 - we have recreated that design now and
73:07 - this was done with materialized
73:10 - um framework and now we've recreated
73:12 - that with material ui
73:16 - so
73:17 - not bad
73:19 - not bad for uh for two pomodoro sessions
73:23 - and uh especially on a live stream
73:25 - everything takes longer on the live
73:26 - stream
73:28 - okay
73:30 - so
73:32 - let me commit this
73:36 - so you all can see all the code
73:39 - and you know what i'm i'm so sorry i
73:40 - didn't start the ngrok server i
73:42 - completely forgot to start it um
73:46 - my apologies for that
73:49 - like i said i'm just
73:50 - i hope i don't get really sick
73:54 - if i'm gonna get sick i hope i get sick
73:56 - right now and get it over with because
73:57 - we have thanksgiving coming up here in
73:59 - the united states and then uh right
74:01 - after that i have the uh
74:03 - um to talk at the november conference
74:07 - so i wanted one or the other i either
74:09 - need to not get sick or just get sick
74:11 - right now and get it over with
74:13 - um
74:14 - all right anyway let's do a git status
74:16 - and see what's changed
74:19 - layout footer
74:20 - yeah that looks about right
74:23 - git commits
74:25 - and i'm gonna use the am flag to just
74:27 - combine it all into one step
74:30 - git commit am and we'll say add footer
74:35 - components
74:37 - let's run all our tests
74:43 - so now on commit we have what we had
74:46 - before whoa
74:50 - all right okay those are just our normal
74:51 - errors for a second i
74:54 - i got nervous for a second okay so in
74:57 - addition to all the stuff we had before
74:59 - which was our
75:00 - uh unit tests
75:02 - and our auto formatting
75:04 - uh with with linting
75:07 - now we have our end to end tests that
75:08 - run so for now there's not that much
75:11 - going on and i have a pretty fast
75:13 - computer so it all happens quickly
75:17 - hopefully it stays somewhat quick
75:18 - although if we end up getting a really
75:20 - large application at some point on a
75:24 - slower computer
75:25 - that may take longer so
75:28 - but at this point it's entirely
75:30 - manageable
75:31 - and now i'm going to push this up to
75:33 - github
75:39 - awesome so now all the code is available
75:41 - to you at the github repo the links in
75:43 - the description
75:44 - at this point i'm going to try to go
75:47 - through all the questions and comments
75:49 - in the live chat i'll respond to uh to
75:51 - all the questions
75:52 - as best i can
75:54 - uh if
75:56 - for those of you maybe can't stick
75:57 - around for the q a session thank you so
75:59 - much for watching i really appreciate it
76:03 - and i will
76:05 - most likely be back tomorrow around the
76:07 - same time assuming my
76:10 - my sore throat doesn't
76:12 - get any worse
76:15 - all right so i left off here
76:20 - let's see
76:23 - i left off in in a discussion between a
76:25 - few of the uh live chat participants so
76:28 - i'm going to skip through that
76:32 - okay rook said that keyboard shortcut he
76:35 - used
76:36 - uh is super useful so the one where i
76:38 - selected
76:40 - um the text so let's go down here
76:44 - so i would highlight something and then
76:47 - hit command d or control d if you're on
76:51 - windows
76:52 - and it highlights everything
76:56 - that's the same
76:57 - right so it's kind of like doing a find
77:00 - except uh it's a lot faster and it
77:03 - immediately highlights that and then
77:05 - it's i think it's called multiple
77:07 - cursors and then you can see i can go in
77:09 - and tab over or type things right
77:13 - and i can type in three places at once
77:17 - not it's very useful it's not as
77:18 - powerful as doing a you know find and
77:21 - replace
77:22 - but if you only have a few things that
77:24 - you need to change it's faster than
77:27 - doing a find and replace
77:29 - so normally if i have
77:31 - well like less than 10 things that i
77:33 - need to change
77:34 - i do
77:37 - the control d or command d
77:40 - the multiple cursors
77:41 - otherwise
77:43 - i go with the control fine
77:46 - but super useful i remember
77:50 - first time i found out about that it was
77:52 - like blew my mind it's like wow this is
77:54 - the coolest thing
77:55 - i think i found out about it on
77:58 - will stern's
78:00 - youtube channel
78:01 - um
78:02 - it's uh learn code academy
78:05 - and um
78:06 - that was it was just
78:08 - it looked really cool when i saw it for
78:10 - the first time
78:20 - all right
78:27 - and yeah she says hello hey yeshu how's
78:30 - it going
78:43 - and
78:45 - all right n is here she says hey hey
78:47 - anna how's it going thanks for watching
78:49 - also says your project looks cool
78:52 - awesome i'm glad you like it
78:55 - let me know uh if there's any
78:58 - anything i could change with that
79:01 - to make it look nicer
79:12 - okay tim asks uh jesse what's cms so
79:15 - what content management system is the
79:17 - old site using
79:18 - is the database behind it public
79:20 - wondering if it can be just migrated to
79:23 - something else and wrapped into a docker
79:26 - container
79:28 - that's a good thought as far as i know
79:29 - the database is not public i need to
79:32 - double check that on friday
79:36 - i think is it friday no no i think it's
79:38 - next week i think next tuesday i'll have
79:41 - a meeting with some of the people from
79:44 - the it department and i'm going to ask
79:47 - them more about the database
79:49 - at that meeting
79:51 - the content management system is called
79:53 - ektron
79:54 - so e-k-t-r-o-n
79:58 - so
80:00 - i haven't come across many people who
80:02 - have ever heard of it let alone worked
80:04 - with it i try not to work with it as
80:06 - much as possible
80:08 - uh it's it's not very user friendly at
80:11 - least the way it's set up for us who
80:13 - knows maybe there's
80:15 - maybe it can be better than it is but
80:19 - in its current state right now it's
80:22 - it's frustrating for the people that
80:24 - have to manage the content
80:37 - uh yes she says hey jesse why don't you
80:39 - install this package it's a teletype
80:42 - it's an atom package
80:45 - using this people can collaborate with
80:47 - each other actually that looks really
80:49 - cool
80:50 - i might have to try that out
80:52 - i'm not gonna install it right now on
80:54 - the stream but um
80:57 - that sounds like it would be really cool
80:59 - to use especially on like some side
81:01 - projects i could see that being really
81:03 - fun or a good teaching tool that would
81:06 - definitely be a good teaching tool i
81:07 - think
81:08 - my wife's learning how to code
81:10 - when she finally gets to the point where
81:12 - she sets up her own code editor i think
81:14 - that would be really fun
81:16 - um the problem would be getting both of
81:18 - us able to code at the same time uh i
81:22 - don't know what i'd do with the kids
81:23 - but uh i that that could be really fun
81:32 - uh california boy asks how long have you
81:34 - been coding
81:35 - um i've been doing front end stuff for
81:37 - about five years now the first year of
81:40 - that was not really like coding it was
81:42 - just like basic
81:45 - basic css changes to wordpress sites and
81:48 - then gradually i got more into things
81:50 - and so about three years ago i started
81:53 - like very deliberately learning more
81:55 - about javascript and getting more into
81:57 - javascript and at the same time getting
81:59 - more in-depth into css as well
82:03 - and then for sure for the last two years
82:06 - uh maybe a little bit longer than two
82:07 - years
82:08 - i've been doing
82:11 - uh
82:12 - you know more with javascript
82:13 - development
82:14 - and um
82:17 - not reacted first i did a lot of single
82:20 - page apps with um with jo with jquery
82:24 - and then i've moved into react you know
82:27 - over the last year or so
82:32 - if you'd like to know more about my
82:33 - journey to becoming a um
82:36 - uh front end developer i go into more
82:39 - depth about like what i learned and when
82:41 - i learned it uh there's a video on my
82:45 - youtube channel which i think is linked
82:47 - in the description um i think it's
82:49 - called like how i became a front-end
82:51 - developer or something like that but you
82:53 - can check that out and um i think it's
82:55 - only about 10 minutes or so but i i
82:57 - talked more about
82:59 - um when i
83:01 - learned a code and how long it took
83:05 - michael says
83:06 - i keep asking my son why he watches game
83:08 - walkthroughs on youtube and now i
83:10 - figured it out
83:13 - well that that's cool
83:14 - um
83:16 - i never thought of this uh
83:18 - as comparable to a game walkthrough but
83:20 - i guess it's um
83:22 - i guess it is
83:24 - you know now that you say that
83:25 - that's kind of cool
83:29 - uh blake says hey guys what games do you
83:31 - play
83:32 - it's a cool question i don't think we've
83:33 - gotten this one before
83:35 - um
83:37 - right now
83:38 - i'm pretty much limited to mobile games
83:40 - because i just don't have the time with
83:43 - uh with four kids all eight years old
83:45 - and under
83:46 - uh to really like sit down
83:49 - at a you know computer or console to
83:51 - play things
83:53 - uh so mostly some some games on mobile
83:56 - um
83:58 - i like to play games from supercell
84:01 - um
84:03 - trying to think what i
84:05 - i have minecraft on on my phone i play
84:07 - that the kids like to

84:11 - uh my son's been getting into minecraft
84:13 - on the pc
84:15 - uh but i can't i can't help him with it
84:17 - i get motion sick when he plays it
84:19 - and uh lately
84:21 - i've been playing super smash brothers
84:23 - with my son just a bit
84:25 - um
84:27 - and i have an old super nintendo that
84:30 - still works and i've been playing super
84:32 - mario rpg with my son as well
84:35 - i did get the the newest version of
84:38 - starcraft so they they remastered so
84:40 - it's like starcraft remastered i got
84:43 - that and i never played it
84:45 - um i just was so busy with my react nano
84:48 - degree course that i never played it i
84:50 - actually connected with one of my old
84:51 - friends from high school and um
84:54 - we were trying to get together to play
84:56 - online but
84:58 - it's never worked out
85:00 - maybe i have to make a better effort
85:02 - maybe over christmas break or something
85:06 - anyway i'm i'm kind of interested at
85:08 - what games you all play if anybody into
85:11 - into video games and
85:14 - if so would you like to play
85:26 - okay uh yes you asked what testing uh
85:30 - you did so the yarn test yeah so it's
85:32 - set up um let's go to the package json
85:34 - for a second
85:36 - so car should set it up that test runs
85:39 - our unit tests and our unit test is jest
85:44 - we're using jest for that and then we
85:46 - have a test.js file that you know
85:48 - configures all that and then also we're
85:50 - running the e2e so the e2e testing is uh
85:53 - we're using mocha
85:55 - and then if you want to so like all
85:57 - these are available in the github repo
86:00 - so you can check out runner.js and um
86:03 - spec js
86:05 - anything that's dot spec.js so
86:09 - if you want to look you know more into
86:10 - exactly what's going on check those
86:12 - files out
86:23 - let's see
86:34 - michael says i want a two shot of you
86:37 - and harshet
86:47 - all right i don't do i don't understand
86:49 - what you want let me know explain
86:51 - explain that please uh michael
86:55 - uh yes you asked um are are we using
86:58 - webpack what yeah so behind the scenes
87:00 - webpack is going here but since we use
87:02 - next to scaffold things we didn't
87:04 - configure webpack ourselves so there's a
87:07 - webpack config going on here
87:09 - that's just the default from next
87:13 - i believe you can do some custom
87:16 - configuration uh next now has a
87:19 - next.config file i don't think we're
87:22 - yeah we're not using it but if we wanted
87:24 - to do some more custom stuff uh then
87:26 - with our webpack build then we could do
87:28 - that but right now the default is
87:30 - working for us
87:38 - all right i see michael um notice the
87:40 - comma thing so thank you for noticing
87:42 - that sorry i didn't look over at the
87:44 - live chat and see michael also said i
87:46 - thought margins and paddings were
87:48 - completely different they are different
87:50 - let me take a second just to run through
87:52 - some margin and padding stuff
87:55 - um
87:57 - where are we at
87:59 - let's let's check this out well let's do
88:01 - this since we're just working on that so
88:02 - i'm gonna inspect this
88:04 - and
88:05 - yeah let's make sure that we're not
88:09 - let's see if i can increase
88:13 - whoa too big
88:17 - all right so let's try this
88:19 - so
88:20 - this i think is a really great
88:22 - demonstration right here in devtools of
88:24 - how margins and paddings work
88:26 - so
88:27 - we can look you know we'll take a look
88:29 - here
88:31 - actually would be better if we had
88:32 - something
88:33 - let's let's go up a bit
88:35 - so when you have something with a border
88:37 - it's it's better okay so right now
88:40 - this is our container div for our footer
88:42 - and you can see here's our border is
88:44 - this thin
88:46 - gold line
88:48 - so our margin of 30 pixels you see is is
88:51 - that orange area it's outside of the
88:55 - border
88:56 - right
88:58 - and then here's our border three pixels
89:00 - and then inside of the border is our
89:02 - padding right so
89:05 - padding
89:06 - is inside the container
89:09 - right so it's inside the container
89:11 - inside the border and it's between the
89:13 - content
89:15 - and the border
89:16 - margin
89:17 - is outside of the border so it's outside
89:20 - of the width of the
89:22 - container and it's between one container
89:25 - let's say another so
89:27 - your padding actually
89:31 - will
89:32 - increase the container so you see like
89:34 - the background color
89:36 - extends to the padding
89:39 - but margin is outside of that so your
89:41 - background color doesn't affect that
89:44 - okay so that's how
89:46 - margins and padding work so that's why
89:48 - sometimes we go with a margin
89:50 - sometimes we go with padding
89:53 - so
89:54 - it just kind of depends if if you're
89:56 - using a div that doesn't really have a
89:58 - background color
90:00 - you can kind of use margin and padding
90:02 - interchangeably
90:03 - the user won't even know
90:05 - because of you know if you have no
90:07 - background color you know in all your
90:09 - divs that you're trying to space out if
90:13 - you do have a color though then it
90:15 - becomes a lot more important as to
90:17 - whether you use padding or margins if
90:20 - you just use padding it's going to look
90:22 - like there's no space between anything
90:25 - because that background color is going
90:26 - to extend
90:29 - but if you just use margin
90:33 - then you may not get like
90:35 - you know like we have here where we have
90:37 - some space between the content and the
90:39 - background color
90:40 - right so
90:42 - it depends on what you're going for but
90:44 - they are definitely different
90:53 - uh blake said that teletype package
90:55 - could be a reason for switching over to
90:56 - adam for me actually uh i saw on twitter
90:59 - this morning
91:01 - that
91:02 - visual studio code has come out with
91:04 - something similar where you can i didn't
91:06 - check it out for sure i just know what i
91:08 - from what i read on twitter
91:10 - uh that you can
91:12 - collaboratively code on the same
91:16 - uh the same document the same um
91:19 - you know file
91:21 - that's what it seemed like like i said i
91:23 - didn't check it out yet
91:24 - i didn't try to use it yet but so
91:27 - potentially visual studio code can do
91:29 - the same thing now
91:35 - michael also asked what's the purpose of
91:37 - setting a margin
91:38 - um i kind of explained that but it
91:41 - basically like in this case we have a
91:43 - margin because
91:45 - i want there to be space between the
91:46 - footer and the content that's up here
91:49 - but i i don't want
91:52 - the color of the footer to be extended
91:54 - here so i want this this white space
91:56 - between
91:59 - so that's where you would set a margin
92:02 - at least in this case that's why we set
92:04 - the margin we could have different
92:05 - reasons for wanting to do a margin as
92:07 - opposed to padding
92:09 - blake asks if anybody has built a pc i
92:12 - built a pc
92:14 - um it's been a long time it's probably
92:16 - been over 10 years since i built a pc
92:20 - i think it's kind of fun but if you mess
92:22 - up
92:23 - like if there's sparks or something you
92:25 - could really mess up all your stuff so
92:28 - that part is not fun i've done that
92:30 - before and ruined things
92:32 - but if it all goes well then it is kind
92:34 - of it's really fun
92:36 - you know to build everything yourself
92:40 - definitely not as easy as just buying it
92:42 - or have a custom having one made but if
92:45 - you if you like that kind of thing then
92:47 - it it was fun
92:55 - uh john
92:57 - asks is box sizing border box on these
92:59 - elements actually i didn't check that's
93:01 - that's kind of important though i should
93:02 - have checked
93:04 - exciting
93:08 - do we not have box sizing on here
93:18 - it's not making a difference
93:24 - let's look at one of these
93:27 - interior ones yeah it is border box on
93:29 - these grid components
93:32 - box sizing border box yeah so the
93:33 - interior grid components are a border
93:36 - box uh you can see i wonder if i can
93:40 - see if we can get it to change
93:44 - yeah okay so
93:45 - look at this huge difference we have
93:47 - depending on on what we do with our um
93:52 - with our box sizing so
93:55 - in terms of our footer it's actually not
93:57 - causing that much of a difference right
93:59 - now but the rest of the elements on the
94:00 - page are like
94:02 - huge different
94:16 - okay blake sorry your uh your comment
94:18 - about uh with the link to the computer
94:22 - um parts
94:23 - it was hidden
94:25 - so i just unhid it so
94:28 - if anybody wants to check it out
94:30 - um at some point towards the bottom of
94:33 - the live chat uh blake pasted a link
94:36 - asking about
94:38 - what what you all think uh about
94:41 - the parts
94:42 - um that he's thinking of using uh to
94:44 - build a pc
94:49 - uh so nope says
94:52 - tested out firefox quantum and it's
94:54 - three times faster than google chrome
94:58 - that's really cool
95:01 - uh and actually has test results in a
95:04 - video uh on
95:06 - on their youtube channel so let's check
95:08 - that out uh if you're interested and
95:10 - thanks for the info
95:16 - oh no
95:17 - shoot
95:18 - i'm sorry so rook just
95:21 - reminded me
95:23 - that when you do get with the flag am it
95:26 - doesn't add a new file so
95:30 - my footer component did not get added
95:33 - i i do this frequently i should remember
95:38 - so let's do a git add
95:40 - now it's there
95:43 - so now i'm gonna do uh git commit m and
95:46 - let's say

96:08 - day
96:34 - all right now let's do
96:38 - okay push to github all right so now the
96:41 - footer component will be there really
96:43 - sorry if anybody tried to check out that
96:44 - code and even more sorry if you tried to
96:47 - uh do a get pool and get everything
96:49 - running

97:00 - cool stuff i'm gonna have to check that
97:02 - out then
97:07 - uh
97:07 - let's see have you ever used bulma css
97:11 - uh if yes what do you think about it
97:13 - i have not used bulma so i i don't
97:16 - really have any opinion about bulma uh
97:18 - because i haven't done anything with it
97:20 - firsthand i i remember checking it out
97:23 - at one point but it's been so long ago i
97:24 - don't i don't really remember what i
97:26 - thought about it
97:32 - uh rick says do you have tests for
97:34 - javascript uh java on public
97:37 - uni github
97:39 - um
97:41 - i think all our tests should be on
97:45 - um on github let's see we have um
97:48 - yeah we should have all our testing
97:49 - stuff
97:51 - on github
98:00 - uh peter says hi jesse do you have any
98:03 - an opinion on linux and the fail of the
98:06 - city
98:07 - uh munich and germany with it regards
98:12 - no i i
98:13 - i actually did not hear anything about
98:15 - that so i'm
98:17 - i'm out
98:19 - i'm at a loss because i didn't hear
98:21 - anything about it so
98:22 - i guess i don't have an opinion
98:24 - in general my opinion on linux is i i
98:27 - really like it
98:28 - for running my servers on it seems to be
98:30 - easy to work with
98:33 - but since i don't really have any
98:35 - information about the particular
98:37 - incident you're talking about i'm sorry
98:39 - but i really can't give you
98:41 - a good answer
98:45 - new york says um i play racing games uh
98:48 - project cars and others with steering
98:50 - wheel and a bucket seat it's really
98:52 - enjoyable that sounds really fun
98:54 - actually that's that's cool
99:02 - let's see dave's talk about super mario
99:05 - bros
99:06 - yeah
99:08 - um
99:11 - let's see yeah actually so
99:14 - i'm gonna share
99:16 - a secret with you all
99:18 - and you cannot tell my eight-year-old or
99:20 - any of my kids not that any of you talk
99:22 - to them
99:23 - but i think
99:24 - i may get my kids
99:26 - the new nintendo the nintendo switch for
99:28 - christmas
99:29 - so
99:31 - i wasn't going to because it's expensive
99:35 - and i don't really have the money to
99:36 - spare right now
99:39 - but my son
99:41 - my oldest raphael who's eight he really
99:43 - wants it and he's been so good lately
99:46 - helping out with the baby and with his
99:48 - younger brother and he's been cleaning
99:50 - he wakes up in the morning before school
99:52 - now
99:53 - every day he's been doing this he wakes
99:55 - up he cleans the bathroom
99:58 - and then
99:59 - reads a book for 20 minutes takes care
100:01 - of his baby sister
100:03 - and his little brother
100:05 - reads his brother a book just been super
100:09 - super helpful so
100:11 - he's acting like that and now i i'm like
100:13 - man i gotta get him something nice so
100:15 - anyway
100:18 - i just wanted to share that with you all
100:19 - because i'm kind of excited about it and
100:21 - i i can't
100:23 - tell my kids be obviously it'd ruin the
100:25 - surprise
100:26 - but if anybody has a switch let me know
100:29 - what you think about it i'm going to end
100:31 - the stream in a minute or so so i may
100:33 - not catch it unless you put in a live
100:34 - chat really quickly
100:37 - but let me know what you think about it
100:38 - is it worth it is it fun
100:40 - what games do you like that you think
100:42 - would be appropriate for little kids
100:47 - are there any games that i should
100:48 - definitely stay away from because
100:49 - they're either not appropriate or
100:50 - they're just terrible games
100:52 - uh anyway let me know because i haven't
100:54 - even used it yet so
100:58 - i'm i i don't really know what's good
100:59 - and what's not good
101:04 - all right
101:06 - um
101:08 - alexandria says hello
101:10 - uh hey how's it going thanks for
101:12 - watching
101:15 - uh eric says inline styles and react yay
101:18 - or nay i don't have a problem with
101:20 - inline styles and react i use them
101:22 - occasionally
101:24 - the only thing is if you need just one
101:27 - element
101:28 - to have a certain style and you don't
101:30 - plan on reusing it anywhere then i don't
101:32 - really see the problem with inline
101:34 - styles at all
101:35 - if you find yourself using inline styles
101:38 - frequently then you probably would be
101:40 - better off using something else could be
101:42 - css and js it could be
101:45 - just a plain style sheet
101:47 - or any of the the many different ways to
101:49 - do css in react
102:00 - uh john says your son sounds like a
102:02 - great person
102:04 - yeah i don't know what happened uh just
102:06 - recently within the past couple weeks he
102:08 - started being super helpful i mean he's
102:10 - always been a pretty good boy but
102:12 - man he just like
102:14 - he just matured all of a sudden um
102:17 - it's kind of bittersweet though like
102:19 - he's not he's not like a little kid
102:21 - anymore he's
102:23 - you know now he's he's way more mature
102:25 - and being helpful so
102:26 - you know it's part of me misses him
102:29 - being little but now i'm just so proud
102:31 - of him now
102:33 - you know for being so helpful
102:35 - uh so anyway
102:37 - yeah so i want him to i want him to like
102:40 - show him how proud i am i can say it to
102:43 - him but
102:44 - i think he'll appreciate it much more if
102:46 - i get him something nice i remember how
102:48 - excited i was when i was about his age
102:50 - and my parents bought me a super
102:52 - nintendo
102:54 - i was just so excited
102:56 - so i think it'd be cool
102:58 - you know to see how excited he gets and
103:00 - his his little brother's uh his little
103:03 - brother and sisters will probably be
103:05 - super excited as well not the baby i
103:07 - mean
103:08 - she'll just chew on the controllers but
103:11 - the other ones will be excited
103:18 - let's see
103:19 - um david says that typography tag sounds
103:22 - like something really interesting
103:24 - yeah i haven't used it that much but it
103:26 - seems like it could be really versatile
103:28 - i'd like to learn more about it so
103:31 - as i use it i'm sure i'll pick up you
103:33 - know more of what it can do and get
103:35 - better with it
103:38 - rook says that's very nice of him those
103:39 - things don't just happen so you and your
103:41 - wife must be good at parenting
103:43 - i don't know about that i tried my best
103:47 - the way i figure you can't really know
103:48 - whether you've done a good job at
103:49 - parenting till till they grow up and you
103:52 - see what they came out as right you know
103:54 - at this point like they're still they're
103:56 - still baking right you don't know
103:58 - whether you've done a good job until
104:00 - until the cookies are done baking and
104:01 - you actually get to taste them right
104:03 - you know so
104:05 - if my kids grow up
104:07 - and
104:08 - have families and they end up being good
104:10 - parents then i'll know that
104:13 - i've been a good parent you know
104:15 - if they grow up and they they're good
104:17 - people then i'll know i've i've done a
104:19 - good job so
104:20 - until then i just
104:22 - trying to do my best
104:26 - david says no problemo we keep the
104:28 - secret thank you i appreciate that
104:31 - uh smilers ask how old are you i am 32

105:40 - rick asks besides free code cam what
105:42 - sources you all use to increase the
105:44 - needed skill sets who has referrals
105:47 - um
105:49 - youtube videos
105:51 - i like youtube videos and just reading
105:53 - articles tutorials documentation
105:57 - um

106:07 - months but i'm going to do a video at
106:08 - some point where i list kind of all my
106:10 - top sources
106:11 - for learning how to code but
106:14 - um
106:16 - oh cool blake says you get five stickers
106:18 - for uh hacktober
106:21 - um
106:22 - or for for the hacktoberfest uh

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse um today we make a footer so we've completed well pretty much completed the header or the app bar the the drawer which is our side nav now we're going to move on to the footer i like to start with those things because they're going to be pretty much consistent across the entire site so i like to go with those first that gives us more time to look at it you know kind of perfect it you know it'll be tested more just by us looking at it you know constantly and as we're building out the rest of the site so the footer is probably the least important of those three components a lot of people won't even see the footer but it's still nice to have uh it's a place where you can put a lot of the links that you know especially with higher education there's a lot of regulations and things so uh you know we'll put privacy policy and different things like that you know down there at the bottom you gotta have them there but you don't really want to waste you know prying real estate at the top on things like that so basically we're going to make a footer that matches the colors of the university and has space you know for all those links at the bottom maybe um like an address it's nice to have an address there i think it's pretty common that people look um you know at the footer for contact information so that's the plan today i do have a sore throat so i've been taking zinc lozenges and um like cough drops and things so hopefully i have a cop dropping cough drop in right now so if i sound weird sorry it's the cough drop but i want to be able to get through the stream uh without my throat just getting crazy and me losing my voice the weird side effect is though my taste buds like totally don't work um i just tried to drink something and it it didn't taste at all like it normally tastes so anyway um miroslav says drink more tea actually i did have a cup of tea before the stream as well but the tea bag was really old i just found it laying in the bottom of one of my uh one of my drawers here and i thought why not i'll try it and so the tea was really really weak but anyway all right enough about my uh health problems and beverages let's get started um what did i do since the last time oh harshit harshit added endtoend testing so we have some new testing so if you um have this repo running locally you'll see some new options for testing and i'm getting a weird okay let me show this now let me change my view here and show you this this error that i've been getting and see what you all think about it so check this out i keep getting this error now it's pretty uh selfexplanatory it actually says check out this github repo to add this so i haven't added it yet i did check out the repo it seems pretty simple um so right now it's not it's not breaking anything it just brings up you know a million warnings like oh there's a lot of warnings here uh so you probably need to fix that i'll try it you know doing what it says in this repo first and then see how it goes uh i also think that i fixed the problem we were having where the um the styles just went all crazy and our fonts were um were just really huge so i went in and just there's an example in material ui's beta github repo for using material ui beta with next so i went through the um the appropriate files in that repository and then compared them to our files and i went through line by line our files are were almost identical they were really just two lines that were different so i changed those two lines to make them the same you could check it out it's it's my the last commit that i made i changed some some lines in there so since i've done that the problem has not happened again but i certainly haven't tested it thoroughly so we'll see if i don't see the problem you know at all for the rest of the day i'll be pretty confident that the problem has been fixed but it did seem like there were other people that were having that same problem or similar problems so i guess it's somewhat common all right oops i wanted to show you here's the footer that we have now this will give you a preview of kind of what it's going to look like so we're going to go with this green color i don't usually like having giant blocks of the green color but i think it's it's okay with the footer uh somewhat appropriate we'll have that gold border so it'll kind of match you know what we have going on here you know at the top here uh we'll have the same thing also i changed the background image so we've had the same background image for for a long time uh not just for this project but um i think did we use it for home test we did actually it's not showing up so at one point we were using it for that too so anyway i found this cute little pug dog and i might have to change it because it's just so cute i just want to look at it all the time i don't even want to code anymore um but anyway i thought that would be fun to look at my um my wife's parents have a little dog that looks pretty much just like this except their dog is way fatter than this dog um but uh it reminds me of that dog all right so here's what we're gonna do we'll have our regular green color here and then a slightly darker shade of that color down here for kind of like the the sub footer i don't know what you'd really call it um we're gonna have our our copyright stuff and then all these links for all the kind of legal stuff that we need and uh i think i'll just i'll keep this set up for now and uh if we want to change it later we can uh but it would be good if somebody happens to get to the bottom of the page then you know why not give them an apply button and donate button again since uh that's what we that's what we expect to be the main actions that someone would take and the main things that we want them to do when they get to this site primarily apply but then also potentially donate depending on whether they're a prospective student or not all right so that's the plan uh this was done i believe we we use material ui for this so we can't just grab all the code we can grab some of it um yeah some of it like basically the content i guess i'm pretty sure material ui does not have any type of premade footer at least they didn't the last time i checked which wasn't that long ago so these are the components we have so far probably what we need to do what we ought to do is maybe just use their um their grid system to build this out so that's my plan if anybody you know has has used material ui and and has done something like this and knows of a better way to do this maybe more simple let me know otherwise uh let's start out by checking out the grid let's see layouts let's check out this grid so we're going to be using a grid component and this is there we go so we'll have these um let's see we can auto layout we can exactly shift available space okay uh so i guess we'll go with this um full width that seems like that'll fit our use case um yeah let's just copy two classes we have going on here yeah we're we're good um let's grab this grid we'll just grab the whole thing and then we'll get rid of what we don't need okay um let's go over oops almost forgot to set the timer uh so we're going to do we're going to break up the stream into 25 minute periods and that'll be broken up by five minute periods in between so 25 minutes of code five minutes of question and answer we'll try to get two sessions in today and then i'll do question and answer after that uh also i see there's a lot of activity in the live chat so um i'll come back to that if you've asked a question already after this 25 minute session i'm gonna come back and go through everything that's already been in the live chat um i see in general a lot of you are just saying hi uh and uh hey everybody actually someone arivan says say hello to us from brazil so i will do that hey um hey everybody in brazil uh everything thanks for watching okay let's copy that and we'll go over to we definitely want to make this its own component so let's go here in components and make a new file we'll call this footer.js for now i'm going to put everything in this footer component but it's possible that we may want to refactor a bit and extract out you know some of what's going to be in the footer component in it that we'll do in this stream extract some of that out and make it into its own components we'll see how large it gets usually i don't like to have really large components uh if if it's avoidable and usually is avoidable all right so let's um actually let's just grab something here this is really big let me grab the drawer is that smaller yeah this looks smaller let's grab this drawer first yeah let's grab the drawer and let's paste that and then that'll save us some time now let's get rid of all this stuff and paste that in and actually we might be able to just keep grid here so let's let's take out drawer as well let's see what it'll look like with just grid let's get rid of some of this stuff and get rid of this footer and let's change this to footer i don't think we need state but we will need we're going to put one function in here and i'm not going to do it yet we'll save it for a little while later um toggle we don't need toggle drawer we don't need to open and let's see this is full nested function we don't need any of these let's grab let's see what we need really search icon button divider we get rid of all of these and this and that and we're not actually using the prop types right now i don't think we'll have any props to be honest with you um well i guess we'll still have the classes did we even have that in the prop types before no we didn't okay so we don't need those either great so now this is looking a lot smaller which is nice and let's see what kind of grid we need so we'll need let's do it like this so definitely we want small let's change this to i'm assuming this is a 12 column system i guess i'll find out in a minute um so if it's a 12 column system i want to change this to be four columns each on a small screen i just want to get some on here so we can see most likely going to be adjusting this at some point and then i would like this to be 12 all the time and that's going to be our bottom our bottom bar there and then we don't need any of these so all right one two three four yep that's what i want glasses paper oh let's get the styles in there you know what i didn't add that root i don't want to add that let's add this uh root um like we have in the example it says class name classes yeah let's add that in may we may not need it but the closer we get to the example the less likely we are to have any problems okay so not bad let's see okay so we do have some text in here i'll leave that in there for now just so we can see it and that looks alright so i'm going to save that and then let's go to our layout component and let's put in below below this part we're going to put in our footer and then we need to import our footer as well so i'm just going to copy what we have here for drawer and then i can put in footer i'm going to save that let's see if we've done anything ah we didn't import grid i'll see when i read the live chat if anybody caught that i thought i had everything okay so let's see let's grab something here make it easier divider and we'll change this to grid and while we're at it let's double check to make sure you don't have anything else in your paper okay so we'll probably need to import paper all right so grid and paper and i think that'll do it yay okay awesome so we have down here at the bottom full width we have our three uh across here like we wanted and then one below obviously this isn't you know this is not how we want it styled but it's just um just the first step in here so at this point we want to do for sure a few things that container that we put in if you remember that that that div that we wrapped everything in i'm kind of glad i did that now because it'll be good to have a wrapper component so that what we'll do is that wrapper component will put our background color of green that hash that's um 21412a um the hex color we'll put that as the background color on that and then we'll put our border on that as well of course we'll take out all these paper styles we'll remove the paper component completely we don't need that and then at the bottom here we'll make sure that there's nothing here no padding margin anything like that so this is flat on the bottom but on this we'll put a background that's just going to be black but it's going to be transparent so it'll show the green behind it but it'll darken it slightly so i think that'll work so for now i'm not going to worry about content let's worry about getting the colors and the positioning down then we can worry about throwing in some of that content all right we got 15 minutes to do this i think we're definitely gonna at least get that part done and then the second pomodoro session uh will probably be where we throw in some links and uh and some of that content okay so we're gonna get rid of paper we don't need that and we also don't need these styles for paper but our roots now we're gonna put a background color of and let me grab let's grab this color here there we go okay so we have our um the color that i'd like to use is already in our theme our material ui custom theme so we're going to use that when we do it like that it allows us then to go back in later on and we can change our primary color and not have to go and change it in every component works basically just like sas variables do i mean not like the inner functioning of it but in terms of being able to change it in one place and have it change everywhere uh it's similar to how the sas variables are okay so we got the background color there we go and we're going to give it a border top and it's gonna be you know what i don't think i can do it like this let me try it like this but i'm almost positive i've tried to do it before and it didn't work so let's try uh border top solid three pixels and then where's our gold color i thought i had it over here and our style guide i have the style guide open somewhere but i don't know where it is so i'm just gonna open it up again i guess i already had that already using it in the at bar component so i could have just grabbed it from there let's see and we need to remove all of these paper uh elements here read this and this as well okay and let's see how that works for now let's go with um let's add one more style and we're going to say this let's call this sub footer and that's going to be that bottom footer and let's put background background color here and let's go with r g b a and we want 2 5 5 2 5 5 2 5 5. um and then let's go with a point zero point one let's see how dark that gets us here okay and let's add that to this bottom one here and so we'll go class name classes sub footer okay save that oh not bad check it out okay so it looks like we have not not perfect here but oh all right so we do have some weird stuff going on we have a little bit of a problem i guess with um being able to scroll over a bit so we'll sort that out at a different time i don't want to get distracted by that right now it looks like that that's affecting everything um yeah but not bad so we have a border so evidently this did work um i don't know what i did last time maybe i'm remembering wrong but looks like that worked awesome uh let's see so put her back interesting all right well let's just put in some some content uh just to get an idea of how it looks so for now i think i'm just gonna put in i'm just gonna put in some divs actually not even that let's just put in some p tags with some lorem ipsum in it don't i have low room i used to have lower mipsum that just popped up guess not all right let's grab some laura mipsum text and i'm going to use bacon ipsum and let's see what that gives us let's see what we have going on here so we have oh goodness i put the uh the wrong um hex wrong colors here uh i'm afraid to check the live chat and see who called me out on that let's try it like this there we go so i instead of doing black with a transparent black i did a transparent white so anyway i usually never do that by hand i always copy it from somewhere or use the color picker and dev tools okay cool not bad that's that's pretty much exactly what we want i could probably stand to go with a little bit darker color here let's increase this and do a 1.5 or 0.15 see how that looks i like that i like that much better okay and that border looks very thin i'm thinking it's not going to work so it works up here i don't want a huge thick border up here and it works it's it's subtle but that's what i want down here we'll leave it like that for now see what i think about it but it may have to make that maybe just one pixel thicker all right let's check my time here wow six minutes okay all right well let's put in some um some text and so we could use the material ui typography component so i guess let's let's check it out it's not here am i missing this style there we go typography all right let's check it out okay so let's try to use typography and maybe give it a um what's the default the defaults body one so we'll just leave it uh blank so we get a default on there and for color actually i don't even know what our secondary set at default we're going to want this to be white okay so for now let's just go in and use typography instead of these p tags oops it's not i wanted to do it like this there we go typography and then we need to bring in typography up here all right let's see if it works did i miss something i didn't really see much of a change let's see what we have let's see what we can do here classes usually stylify the components well let's add a color here footer text and let's go color and let's give it oops okay give it that color we're gonna go font size 16 pixels uh and so then on these typography no just on the first ones we're going to get class name classes let me call this footer footer text all right see what happens oh footer text oops i'm always forgetting the commas here okay awesome so we've got the white text let's check yep we got our font size we wanted uh 16. i may want to make that bigger for the top section leave it smaller down here i think i do i don't know about you but that just looks really small let's bump that up then to 18 and see what it looks like yeah that's that's better change the line height as well okay all right cool um we definitely need some some padding right need some padding on the sides top and bottom so let's do that for here we can put let's just put some general so we need padding and uh we need our top padding to be let's try eight first we might have to go with 16. so we're gonna go eight and on the sides we are gonna go 16 and 16 and we're going to go 16 on the sides especially because we have that scroll bar to deal with and then we'll do 16 on both sides be just to be consistent and then the bottom i want it to be zero for right now because remember we have that section with that different cut background color so we don't want to add padding there because that's going to push that section up and there'll be a small stripe of our original base color so we don't want that so we're going to put the padding directly on that sub footer so padding bottom and that's where we'll have uh eight yeah let's give it eight pixels on the bottom and we want um to push it up push the content up above it right so we have the the padding covered everywhere else except for there so let's do a margin top and first we'll try out 8 pixels and we'll go from there right we want to do a margin and not padding because we did padding top that would make the entire section color included get bigger we don't want that so that's why we went with margin let's save that and see what happens huh okay so we we got a little bit of let's inspect this we got a little bit of what we wanted but not not everything we wanted so we have our padding here so check out that padding whoa and then our margin okay 12. looks like we already had some padding going on there by default so maybe we won't need to do that but i do like the uh the margin all right so let's stop right there because my timer is up i'm going to take a short break now go over some questions in the live chat and then we'll come back and we'll mess around a little bit more with our margin and padding so scroll all the way up and i'll try to get through as much as i can there's quite a bit here in the live chat so we'll see how it goes uh jimmy says hi i'm new hey how's it going uh welcome to the uh welcome to the the live stream and uh feel free to ask any questions uh or put comments in the chat i'd love to hear your opinion on things okay jimmy had asked does does this dude reply so not sure if you're still here jimmy sorry i didn't see that but uh i did explain it earlier hopefully you stuck around and got the explanation that i will i do reply to things in the live chat but during the the breaks that i take to go to the live chat i did try before to you know try to monitor the live chat while i'm coding and uh it ended up not being so good it took forever to code anything and um yeah so i can't can't do that thank you uh for everyone who's giving me suggestions on what to take uh for my sore throat uh i i really appreciate that uh erivon asks what operating system do you guys use to code i'm on mac os right now i almost exclusively use mac to code my servers are usually ubuntu linux and i do have pcs at home but i don't code on them often i i just use them for gaming okay horseshit asked about the end and testing if it works on my machine yes it did work um so yeah it worked it worked perfectly well with the exception of those errors that were on there but that's not due to the testing those errors showed up before i merged your pull request so uh but the the end end testing itself uh worked perfectly so thank you for that hardship rook said that picture is the best the dog yeah that's such a cute dog i want to like get rid of this text now so i could see this dog better oh cool so a heart should ask if we could if i could demo the end end testing yeah so let's do that so i'm going to go yarn test and uh if you have the most the uptodate version of this on your local machine when you uh when you pull the latest make sure you run yarn to install all the new npm packages but then after you've done that you can type yarn test and we'll see our tests running so those tests passed those were unit tests now this is our endtoend test so you see it actually did the testing in the browser which is awesome and we can see it even gives us uh timing in milliseconds so really cool if anybody's interested in testing or learning more about it or if you know about it and would like to get some more practice you know feel free to add to the test that we already have on there and then as we add new components if you'd like to write tests for them you know that would be very helpful um i'm still pretty new with testing so i'll do my best to uh keep up to date when we add new components but to to be honest if i'm really like if i have a lot to do the testing is gonna get put off uh that's just i am working on a few other projects right now so i may not be able to put in the time that i i ought to on that uh jesse says uh jesse mcintyre says that pick is awesome philip says i hope the pick is production ready jesse says it's way too distracting yeah as soon as i saw that picture i knew like i have to have this on here okay uh so didn't get through everything in the chat right now but i will after this next pomodoro session so i took a note of where i'm at in the live chat i'll go right back to where i left off uh after the next session and let's see okay all right so we put in some padding and things but it didn't exactly work like i expected it to so let's check out what's going on is it this i might have to pull this over a bit um okay so our footer is supposed to have all right i need to do something else with this let's do it like this um let's take this and dock it to the bottom and let's make this full screen all right so when i do it like this unfortunately i won't be able to make this very much bigger we'd never be able to see anything and also i realize that this section is now covered up but i will do my best to talk about what's going on all right so what we have here that i'm i'm wondering about is we should have padding top left oh goodness it was my mistake i messed it up uh i'm sure you all noticed this already we're mad here all right let's um arrange this a bit better there we go okay so unfortunately i don't know what happened to my brain for a second but this is not how you do positioning so the correct order is top right bottom left why why i didn't remember that at the moment i have no idea but that was our problem so you can see now we have uh our eight or was it eight or sixteen yes sixteen pixels of padding on both sides here and eight at the top at the bottom our container has nothing in terms of padding oh goodness i didn't even think about this but we can't do that right because then we're going to have these little spots here let's fix that so here's what we need to do we have these these grid items here we'll need to put our padding directly into these we can keep top the top padding here so let's do padding top and how did that look okay i think we can go 16 for the padding top so let's do that and then we're going to make let's see footer text let's just go footer footer sections and let's say padding for footer sections and we'll give a we're going to give them padding of zero for the top and bottom and then for left and right let's give them 16. we'll see how this looks it may be too much between sections but uh it's worth a shot so let's put in here in these grids so just those first three class name we're going to say classes dot footer sections great all right now let's see what it looks like and i forgot my comma again goodness i need to get like a little jar on my desk and uh i'll like every time i forget a comma i'll have to put a coin in the jar and then it can go to like some charity or something but then i'll learn my lesson to quit forgetting that didn't work like i wanted it to but i'll learn my lesson to quit for getting the commas in javascript arrays all right let's see here's a grid item oops you know what our padding is being overridden that's fine let's go with a margin instead i don't think we have a margin on any of these yet no no margin but margins will work in this case so yeah let's not try to fight what's already there we'll just switch it up to a margin no all right let's try this let's try to use what's already built in here oh man so okay how about we'll do this let's see if this works instead of putting it on these grid components whoops didn't grab it all instead of the grid components we're going to put these on typography how do we do this can i just do a comma oh goodness no i can't see if i can do a comma classes. footer sections i think i can do that no i can't uh let's oops let's see if that works yeah there we go i need i need to make it an array and then it will work okay all right awesome so we finally got what we wanted that took way longer than expected uh but it's not overall not bad i think we're making pretty quick progress uh and did i find it yes okay i found the issue uh can you all see that here's what's causing our i literally have my face like a few inches away from the screen right now so uh i don't know if you could all see that yeah it's right uh uh right here in the corner the bottom uh right hand corner our our shadow right is not a shadow but you know our i guess our overlay is extending out you know past this so that's where our issue is where we're getting this little section on the sides we definitely don't want that so why is this extending out when oh goodness our grid our grids extending out as well so all of our great items are extending out we don't want that hmm so hmm okay so it's has to do with what's going on here all right let's re uh reload that just to get rid of what i did oh let's continue spacing all right let's check out our grid stuff what's the spacing hmm okay this is our problem here so this is exactly what's happening let me zoom in on that a bit uh so you probably couldn't see this in dev tools because the the it was too small and i think it was covered up by the um by the video feed of my face but there's a negative margin and that's how they're getting this to work so it's the the official width of this grid is 100 of the screen plus 24 pixels and then there's a negative margin all around of negative 12 pixels um so let's see not using the spacing feature and implementing it in user space adding a padding on the parent with at least the spacing value adding overflow x hidden on the parent actually if this works this will be the easiest way let's try it we can try it oops right here in dev tools so the parent would be this so let's go with overflow x hidden all right cool that solves the problem um awesome so we're going to add this here so our root component is our parent and we're going to say we're gonna remember a comma this time overflow x hidden save that and all right so now we don't have our horizontal scroll wonderful we still have what do we have going on here what happened to our our top hmm goodness yeah i want to do this too all right so i'm going to take off the spacing or i think the example said set it to zero i'm going to take that off as well because that's seems like it's complicating a lot of what's going on here so let's check okay good so our padding is now working properly great okay okay great okay that seems to work so um so what we ended up doing then is uh there's this builtin spacing uh property that you can use with the grid container uh component and it was it was kind of messing up what we were trying to do you know manually with our styles here so i just got rid of that i know it's easier for me just to work with the css or the css and js directly uh then to try to figure out you know what i'm what i'm doing here because i know exactly what i want with this footer component so i think it's just going to be a lot faster to do it like this all right let me check my time seven minutes all right okay so let's get some stuff here in this sub footer and yeah that'll be all we will do let's find our example okay yes we just have the copyright and these links let me grab this and for this i want to put a span and within that this is going to be this dot get here and up here we're gonna have get here and this will be what is it i always have to lift this up uh i wonder if we're doing that here already i think we are okay so we just need to get let's say this const uh date today equals new date and then we'll say return i'm going to return date today dot get full year all right all right let's see if that works what do we get yep no it didn't work all right let's see what comes up here so this afternoon components all right what did i do you're still getting it class name looks like and two errors let's see just 44. let's check the first one saying i'm giving it an invalid prop but it's working all right so it's just a prop type thing now this one i'm pretty sure we've done this before in react yeah we have right maybe we haven't uh is this not working hmm okay let me just skip that right now for some reason i'm just not seeing what the problem is i'm sure it's just something silly that i'm forgetting to do or doing wrong um let's we need a little bit of padding here a little bit more than we currently have let's see adding bottom margins up actually yeah we don't have any padding right now so let's add some adding top and let's go with eight pixels on the top good so we have eight on the top eight on the bottom it's pretty slim might have to increase the padding a bit but i i kind of like to have it a little bit more slim i think it looks nicer okay not bad so let's add that padding on the top and that'll be the last thing that we do for uh for this stream in terms of coding let's see you know what we need some padding on the sides as well so let's go ahead and just change our sub footer instead of doing a padding bottom we're just going to do padding and we'll go with that top of 8 pixels and then left and right of 16 and bottom of zero since we already have padding on the entire thing wait did we no we didn't are we getting that padding on the bottom oh i had it separately how did i have that stuff for this somehow i had padding bottom on there i'm not sure how okay um let's add eight pixels then and then 16 pixels sorry everybody i'm starting a little bit of a headache so i'm just kind of i don't know if i'm making a lot of sense at this point but in general we're getting done what we want to get done okay that looks good we have our the right amount of padding okay all right not bad so uh you know we have you know let's just compare a bit let me get rid of this and uh we'll compare so we have them side by side here uh this is what we are going for and so that looks okay now forget contentwise because i'm not worried about content right now but just in terms of design we basically matched it right we've gone with a little bit thinner subfooter um a little bit thinner of our our top border but we have recreated that design now and this was done with materialized um framework and now we've recreated that with material ui so not bad not bad for uh for two pomodoro sessions and uh especially on a live stream everything takes longer on the live stream okay so let me commit this so you all can see all the code and you know what i'm i'm so sorry i didn't start the ngrok server i completely forgot to start it um my apologies for that like i said i'm just i hope i don't get really sick if i'm gonna get sick i hope i get sick right now and get it over with because we have thanksgiving coming up here in the united states and then uh right after that i have the uh um to talk at the november conference so i wanted one or the other i either need to not get sick or just get sick right now and get it over with um all right anyway let's do a git status and see what's changed layout footer yeah that looks about right git commits and i'm gonna use the am flag to just combine it all into one step git commit am and we'll say add footer components let's run all our tests so now on commit we have what we had before whoa all right okay those are just our normal errors for a second i i got nervous for a second okay so in addition to all the stuff we had before which was our uh unit tests and our auto formatting uh with with linting now we have our end to end tests that run so for now there's not that much going on and i have a pretty fast computer so it all happens quickly hopefully it stays somewhat quick although if we end up getting a really large application at some point on a slower computer that may take longer so but at this point it's entirely manageable and now i'm going to push this up to github awesome so now all the code is available to you at the github repo the links in the description at this point i'm going to try to go through all the questions and comments in the live chat i'll respond to uh to all the questions as best i can uh if for those of you maybe can't stick around for the q a session thank you so much for watching i really appreciate it and i will most likely be back tomorrow around the same time assuming my my sore throat doesn't get any worse all right so i left off here let's see i left off in in a discussion between a few of the uh live chat participants so i'm going to skip through that okay rook said that keyboard shortcut he used uh is super useful so the one where i selected um the text so let's go down here so i would highlight something and then hit command d or control d if you're on windows and it highlights everything that's the same right so it's kind of like doing a find except uh it's a lot faster and it immediately highlights that and then it's i think it's called multiple cursors and then you can see i can go in and tab over or type things right and i can type in three places at once not it's very useful it's not as powerful as doing a you know find and replace but if you only have a few things that you need to change it's faster than doing a find and replace so normally if i have well like less than 10 things that i need to change i do the control d or command d the multiple cursors otherwise i go with the control fine but super useful i remember first time i found out about that it was like blew my mind it's like wow this is the coolest thing i think i found out about it on will stern's youtube channel um it's uh learn code academy and um that was it was just it looked really cool when i saw it for the first time all right and yeah she says hello hey yeshu how's it going and all right n is here she says hey hey anna how's it going thanks for watching also says your project looks cool awesome i'm glad you like it let me know uh if there's any anything i could change with that to make it look nicer okay tim asks uh jesse what's cms so what content management system is the old site using is the database behind it public wondering if it can be just migrated to something else and wrapped into a docker container that's a good thought as far as i know the database is not public i need to double check that on friday i think is it friday no no i think it's next week i think next tuesday i'll have a meeting with some of the people from the it department and i'm going to ask them more about the database at that meeting the content management system is called ektron so ektron so i haven't come across many people who have ever heard of it let alone worked with it i try not to work with it as much as possible uh it's it's not very user friendly at least the way it's set up for us who knows maybe there's maybe it can be better than it is but in its current state right now it's it's frustrating for the people that have to manage the content uh yes she says hey jesse why don't you install this package it's a teletype it's an atom package using this people can collaborate with each other actually that looks really cool i might have to try that out i'm not gonna install it right now on the stream but um that sounds like it would be really cool to use especially on like some side projects i could see that being really fun or a good teaching tool that would definitely be a good teaching tool i think my wife's learning how to code when she finally gets to the point where she sets up her own code editor i think that would be really fun um the problem would be getting both of us able to code at the same time uh i don't know what i'd do with the kids but uh i that that could be really fun uh california boy asks how long have you been coding um i've been doing front end stuff for about five years now the first year of that was not really like coding it was just like basic basic css changes to wordpress sites and then gradually i got more into things and so about three years ago i started like very deliberately learning more about javascript and getting more into javascript and at the same time getting more indepth into css as well and then for sure for the last two years uh maybe a little bit longer than two years i've been doing uh you know more with javascript development and um not reacted first i did a lot of single page apps with um with jo with jquery and then i've moved into react you know over the last year or so if you'd like to know more about my journey to becoming a um uh front end developer i go into more depth about like what i learned and when i learned it uh there's a video on my youtube channel which i think is linked in the description um i think it's called like how i became a frontend developer or something like that but you can check that out and um i think it's only about 10 minutes or so but i i talked more about um when i learned a code and how long it took michael says i keep asking my son why he watches game walkthroughs on youtube and now i figured it out well that that's cool um i never thought of this uh as comparable to a game walkthrough but i guess it's um i guess it is you know now that you say that that's kind of cool uh blake says hey guys what games do you play it's a cool question i don't think we've gotten this one before um right now i'm pretty much limited to mobile games because i just don't have the time with uh with four kids all eight years old and under uh to really like sit down at a you know computer or console to play things uh so mostly some some games on mobile um i like to play games from supercell um trying to think what i i have minecraft on on my phone i play that the kids like to you know to watch when i play that uh my son's been getting into minecraft on the pc uh but i can't i can't help him with it i get motion sick when he plays it and uh lately i've been playing super smash brothers with my son just a bit um and i have an old super nintendo that still works and i've been playing super mario rpg with my son as well i did get the the newest version of starcraft so they they remastered so it's like starcraft remastered i got that and i never played it um i just was so busy with my react nano degree course that i never played it i actually connected with one of my old friends from high school and um we were trying to get together to play online but it's never worked out maybe i have to make a better effort maybe over christmas break or something anyway i'm i'm kind of interested at what games you all play if anybody into into video games and if so would you like to play okay uh yes you asked what testing uh you did so the yarn test yeah so it's set up um let's go to the package json for a second so car should set it up that test runs our unit tests and our unit test is jest we're using jest for that and then we have a test.js file that you know configures all that and then also we're running the e2e so the e2e testing is uh we're using mocha and then if you want to so like all these are available in the github repo so you can check out runner.js and um spec js anything that's dot spec.js so if you want to look you know more into exactly what's going on check those files out let's see michael says i want a two shot of you and harshet all right i don't do i don't understand what you want let me know explain explain that please uh michael uh yes you asked um are are we using webpack what yeah so behind the scenes webpack is going here but since we use next to scaffold things we didn't configure webpack ourselves so there's a webpack config going on here that's just the default from next i believe you can do some custom configuration uh next now has a next.config file i don't think we're yeah we're not using it but if we wanted to do some more custom stuff uh then with our webpack build then we could do that but right now the default is working for us all right i see michael um notice the comma thing so thank you for noticing that sorry i didn't look over at the live chat and see michael also said i thought margins and paddings were completely different they are different let me take a second just to run through some margin and padding stuff um where are we at let's let's check this out well let's do this since we're just working on that so i'm gonna inspect this and yeah let's make sure that we're not let's see if i can increase whoa too big all right so let's try this so this i think is a really great demonstration right here in devtools of how margins and paddings work so we can look you know we'll take a look here actually would be better if we had something let's let's go up a bit so when you have something with a border it's it's better okay so right now this is our container div for our footer and you can see here's our border is this thin gold line so our margin of 30 pixels you see is is that orange area it's outside of the border right and then here's our border three pixels and then inside of the border is our padding right so padding is inside the container right so it's inside the container inside the border and it's between the content and the border margin is outside of the border so it's outside of the width of the container and it's between one container let's say another so your padding actually will increase the container so you see like the background color extends to the padding but margin is outside of that so your background color doesn't affect that okay so that's how margins and padding work so that's why sometimes we go with a margin sometimes we go with padding so it just kind of depends if if you're using a div that doesn't really have a background color you can kind of use margin and padding interchangeably the user won't even know because of you know if you have no background color you know in all your divs that you're trying to space out if you do have a color though then it becomes a lot more important as to whether you use padding or margins if you just use padding it's going to look like there's no space between anything because that background color is going to extend but if you just use margin then you may not get like you know like we have here where we have some space between the content and the background color right so it depends on what you're going for but they are definitely different uh blake said that teletype package could be a reason for switching over to adam for me actually uh i saw on twitter this morning that visual studio code has come out with something similar where you can i didn't check it out for sure i just know what i from what i read on twitter uh that you can collaboratively code on the same uh the same document the same um you know file that's what it seemed like like i said i didn't check it out yet i didn't try to use it yet but so potentially visual studio code can do the same thing now michael also asked what's the purpose of setting a margin um i kind of explained that but it basically like in this case we have a margin because i want there to be space between the footer and the content that's up here but i i don't want the color of the footer to be extended here so i want this this white space between so that's where you would set a margin at least in this case that's why we set the margin we could have different reasons for wanting to do a margin as opposed to padding blake asks if anybody has built a pc i built a pc um it's been a long time it's probably been over 10 years since i built a pc i think it's kind of fun but if you mess up like if there's sparks or something you could really mess up all your stuff so that part is not fun i've done that before and ruined things but if it all goes well then it is kind of it's really fun you know to build everything yourself definitely not as easy as just buying it or have a custom having one made but if you if you like that kind of thing then it it was fun uh john asks is box sizing border box on these elements actually i didn't check that's that's kind of important though i should have checked exciting do we not have box sizing on here it's not making a difference let's look at one of these interior ones yeah it is border box on these grid components box sizing border box yeah so the interior grid components are a border box uh you can see i wonder if i can see if we can get it to change yeah okay so look at this huge difference we have depending on on what we do with our um with our box sizing so in terms of our footer it's actually not causing that much of a difference right now but the rest of the elements on the page are like huge different okay blake sorry your uh your comment about uh with the link to the computer um parts it was hidden so i just unhid it so if anybody wants to check it out um at some point towards the bottom of the live chat uh blake pasted a link asking about what what you all think uh about the parts um that he's thinking of using uh to build a pc uh so nope says tested out firefox quantum and it's three times faster than google chrome that's really cool uh and actually has test results in a video uh on on their youtube channel so let's check that out uh if you're interested and thanks for the info oh no shoot i'm sorry so rook just reminded me that when you do get with the flag am it doesn't add a new file so my footer component did not get added i i do this frequently i should remember so let's do a git add now it's there so now i'm gonna do uh git commit m and let's say get footer add footer component for real this time all right sorry about that everyone i actually think i did that last week too and i didn't realize it until the next day all right now let's do okay push to github all right so now the footer component will be there really sorry if anybody tried to check out that code and even more sorry if you tried to uh do a get pool and get everything running and uh thanks for letting me know about that rook smiler says firefox quantum is really cool stuff i'm gonna have to check that out then uh let's see have you ever used bulma css uh if yes what do you think about it i have not used bulma so i i don't really have any opinion about bulma uh because i haven't done anything with it firsthand i i remember checking it out at one point but it's been so long ago i don't i don't really remember what i thought about it uh rick says do you have tests for javascript uh java on public uni github um i think all our tests should be on um on github let's see we have um yeah we should have all our testing stuff on github uh peter says hi jesse do you have any an opinion on linux and the fail of the city uh munich and germany with it regards no i i i actually did not hear anything about that so i'm i'm out i'm at a loss because i didn't hear anything about it so i guess i don't have an opinion in general my opinion on linux is i i really like it for running my servers on it seems to be easy to work with but since i don't really have any information about the particular incident you're talking about i'm sorry but i really can't give you a good answer new york says um i play racing games uh project cars and others with steering wheel and a bucket seat it's really enjoyable that sounds really fun actually that's that's cool let's see dave's talk about super mario bros yeah um let's see yeah actually so i'm gonna share a secret with you all and you cannot tell my eightyearold or any of my kids not that any of you talk to them but i think i may get my kids the new nintendo the nintendo switch for christmas so i wasn't going to because it's expensive and i don't really have the money to spare right now but my son my oldest raphael who's eight he really wants it and he's been so good lately helping out with the baby and with his younger brother and he's been cleaning he wakes up in the morning before school now every day he's been doing this he wakes up he cleans the bathroom and then reads a book for 20 minutes takes care of his baby sister and his little brother reads his brother a book just been super super helpful so he's acting like that and now i i'm like man i gotta get him something nice so anyway i just wanted to share that with you all because i'm kind of excited about it and i i can't tell my kids be obviously it'd ruin the surprise but if anybody has a switch let me know what you think about it i'm going to end the stream in a minute or so so i may not catch it unless you put in a live chat really quickly but let me know what you think about it is it worth it is it fun what games do you like that you think would be appropriate for little kids are there any games that i should definitely stay away from because they're either not appropriate or they're just terrible games uh anyway let me know because i haven't even used it yet so i'm i i don't really know what's good and what's not good all right um alexandria says hello uh hey how's it going thanks for watching uh eric says inline styles and react yay or nay i don't have a problem with inline styles and react i use them occasionally the only thing is if you need just one element to have a certain style and you don't plan on reusing it anywhere then i don't really see the problem with inline styles at all if you find yourself using inline styles frequently then you probably would be better off using something else could be css and js it could be just a plain style sheet or any of the the many different ways to do css in react uh john says your son sounds like a great person yeah i don't know what happened uh just recently within the past couple weeks he started being super helpful i mean he's always been a pretty good boy but man he just like he just matured all of a sudden um it's kind of bittersweet though like he's not he's not like a little kid anymore he's you know now he's he's way more mature and being helpful so you know it's part of me misses him being little but now i'm just so proud of him now you know for being so helpful uh so anyway yeah so i want him to i want him to like show him how proud i am i can say it to him but i think he'll appreciate it much more if i get him something nice i remember how excited i was when i was about his age and my parents bought me a super nintendo i was just so excited so i think it'd be cool you know to see how excited he gets and his his little brother's uh his little brother and sisters will probably be super excited as well not the baby i mean she'll just chew on the controllers but the other ones will be excited let's see um david says that typography tag sounds like something really interesting yeah i haven't used it that much but it seems like it could be really versatile i'd like to learn more about it so as i use it i'm sure i'll pick up you know more of what it can do and get better with it rook says that's very nice of him those things don't just happen so you and your wife must be good at parenting i don't know about that i tried my best the way i figure you can't really know whether you've done a good job at parenting till till they grow up and you see what they came out as right you know at this point like they're still they're still baking right you don't know whether you've done a good job until until the cookies are done baking and you actually get to taste them right you know so if my kids grow up and have families and they end up being good parents then i'll know that i've been a good parent you know if they grow up and they they're good people then i'll know i've i've done a good job so until then i just trying to do my best david says no problemo we keep the secret thank you i appreciate that uh smilers ask how old are you i am 32 so i just turned 32 at the end of october so just a few weeks ago and uh yes i'm 32 and i have four kids i've been married for 10 years like 10 and a half years okay oh blake got his uh hacktober shirt awesome awesome that's that's really cool i'm still waiting on mine uh when i get it i'll let you all know um i'll probably take a picture of it and i think you get a sticker too i'll probably take a picture of him put on instagram um so i'll be super excited about that as well but um anyway i am at the bottom of the live chat now i'm all through everything and i'm feeling really tired right now my throat's starting to hurt again so now's a great time to wrap things up um all right i got one more question let's rick asks besides free code cam what sources you all use to increase the needed skill sets who has referrals um youtube videos i like youtube videos and just reading articles tutorials documentation um yeah so i guess i could give you more specific things i'm going to do a video at some point i know i've been saying this for months but i'm going to do a video at some point where i list kind of all my top sources for learning how to code but um oh cool blake says you get five stickers for uh hacktober um or for for the hacktoberfest uh awesome looking forward to that okay so i'm gonna end the stream for real this time uh thank you so much for watching and uh for all you're contributing in the in the live chat all your comments and questions and uh like i said i'll probably be back tomorrow probably around the same time 2 p.m eastern time uh if i'm feeling all right um if i feel any worse tomorrow i may end up just staying at home so i'll let you all know on on twitter if i'm not going to stream and i'll put something in the slack channel and the getter channel too otherwise i will be back tomorrow and until then i hope you all have a wonderful day
