00:03 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:05 - with jesse i'm jesse and today we're
00:09 - going to do some styling and some ui
00:11 - changes to make this
00:13 - app look a little nicer
00:16 - as you can see there's no video right
00:18 - now
00:19 - so
00:21 - i don't know why uh
00:24 - i i moved so i moved into my new house i
00:28 - unplugged everything moved all my
00:29 - computers over plugged it back in and my
00:36 - webcam now does not work
00:40 - so i'm installing
00:42 - some stuff from the manufacturer that
00:45 - hopefully will help it says it's going
00:46 - to finish in about a minute so
00:48 - the video may turn on it may not but
00:52 - you all don't watch this for my face
00:55 - anyway um
00:57 - so
00:59 - let's get started uh as long as you can
01:02 - see the screen and hear me i think
01:03 - that's uh
01:04 - that's good enough
01:06 - um i'm gonna check real quick and see
01:09 - what everyone's saying in the chat
01:13 - um
01:17 - hey everybody see a lot of people just
01:19 - saying hi
01:20 - how's it going
01:22 - okay
01:27 - let's
01:29 - bring up the app first
01:32 - so that everybody who hasn't seen it yet
01:33 - can at least see it
01:35 - um
01:36 - also
01:40 - sorry the
01:41 - the installation just
01:43 - finished so
01:44 - let's see oh okay
01:46 - no i don't want to sign up for this
01:50 - okay
01:54 - wow
01:56 - all right so i don't think that did
01:57 - anything because
02:00 - nothing happened
02:13 - hey
02:14 - we've got something
02:17 - that's weird
02:37 - huh
02:44 - there we go
02:46 - it works
02:49 - all right
02:50 - let's move it over so it's
02:52 - all right spot
02:53 - there we go okay
02:56 - so i i guess it was just a driver or
02:58 - something
02:59 - um you can see my background has changed
03:02 - so this is my new place
03:04 - um
03:05 - i'm thinking about getting a fish tank
03:07 - back there so i have a fish tank with
03:09 - some goldfish i haven't moved it yet
03:13 - so i don't know let me know what you
03:15 - think if you want to see my goldfish
03:17 - behind me
03:19 - anyway
03:21 - all right let's get started so
03:24 - i do want to give a shout out to chris
03:27 - who did a
03:31 - awesome pull request
03:37 - so let's do uh get pool
03:41 - this is going to pull down all those
03:42 - changes from the port so you can see
03:44 - like the
03:45 - the code changed immediately there
03:48 - um
03:49 - so this is decently significant pull
03:51 - requests especially considering the
03:52 - project's still small this is uh quite a
03:55 - few changes so thank you chris uh we're
03:57 - also gonna do yarn this is a good
04:00 - practice anytime you start a project
04:03 - or i'm sorry anytime you're working on a
04:04 - project first thing you
04:07 - should do
04:08 - um is
04:10 - do a get pull as soon as you you start
04:12 - working on it in the morning you know do
04:14 - get pool
04:15 - do um
04:17 - and then run yarn or npm install that
04:20 - way you know you have the latest
04:22 - you know changes
04:24 - and
04:27 - and the packages right like i've
04:29 - forgotten this before
04:30 - um
04:32 - and
04:34 - i start working realize i don't have the
04:36 - latest changes and then there's like
04:38 - merge conflicts and stuff or i do
04:41 - remember to pull but i don't remember to
04:43 - to run yarn and install the packages and
04:45 - then i get all these errors
04:47 - uh and for a second i'm freaking out
04:49 - before i realized that oh i i just
04:52 - didn't install the new packages so
04:57 - let's start
04:58 - so let's start this up that way we could
05:00 - see the app
05:01 - uh so we'll be able to see it and also
05:04 - let's go
05:08 - to the pull requests so the issues now
05:12 - there's only two issues left i'm sure
05:14 - we'll we'll be able to add some more but
05:16 - we're going to close pull requests and
05:18 - check out
05:21 - this one right so i'm not gonna go
05:23 - through all of this just so that we have
05:25 - time for coding but
05:27 - check this out the link to the uh the
05:29 - repo is in the description
05:31 - so you can check out but basically this
05:33 - fixes two problems one we had said that
05:38 - we don't want
05:39 - the user to get the same question
05:42 - in a row like the exact same question
05:45 - twice in a row
05:47 - also we don't want when you're doing
05:49 - subtraction we don't want subtraction to
05:51 - result in a negative number at least not
05:53 - in in the first the first level
05:57 - uh also it found some bugs that i didn't
05:59 - realize were happening and fix those as
06:01 - well so
06:03 - that's awesome you can check that out
06:05 - there you can check out all the files
06:06 - that it have changed um add a little bit
06:10 - to the the prettier config
06:12 - which is nice
06:14 - i'll probably set up
06:17 - some like automatic linting so that
06:20 - anytime anyone tries to commit code
06:23 - it'll
06:24 - auto lint it
06:27 - and let me know if you want to see how
06:28 - to do that i can do it on a stream
06:30 - otherwise maybe i just try to do it
06:32 - you know on my own and just have it set
06:35 - up but it is kind of a cool setup i
06:36 - usually do it for all my projects
06:39 - and it it avoids having uh like weird
06:43 - commits where you have uh
06:47 - it looks like you have a lot of changes
06:49 - but they're not really changes it's just
06:51 - like formatting things like a semicolon
06:53 - or not using a semicolon or
06:56 - weird spaces so
06:58 - anyway
07:00 - um oh i have some questions about that
07:03 - uh auto link so when i say like auto
07:06 - linting and auto formatting i just mean
07:08 - like as soon as you would do like a git
07:10 - commit
07:12 - there'd be a pre-commit hook that would
07:14 - run
07:14 - and it would go through all your code it
07:17 - would check it to make sure the syntax
07:19 - is correct according to rules that we
07:21 - set up
07:23 - and then
07:25 - if it's possible for it to just
07:27 - automatically change your code to use
07:29 - the rules we set up it will do that
07:32 - so it's it's pretty cool it keeps a nice
07:34 - standard and it makes it so that if you
07:37 - want to contribute to this project
07:40 - you don't have to learn all the rules
07:43 - you just code how you like to code
07:46 - and then whenever you go to commit it'll
07:48 - change it all
07:49 - and it looks like there is some interest
07:50 - so yeah i'll definitely show you how to
07:52 - do that
07:53 - um
07:54 - maybe on the next stream that's what
07:56 - that's what i'll do so yeah it's a cool
07:58 - little setup
08:00 - and
08:02 - uh
08:03 - let's see
08:06 - i lost my train of thought what were you
08:08 - doing oh i wanted to show everybody the
08:10 - app
08:11 - okay just so you know
08:13 - um the way this is going to go we're
08:14 - going to do a little bit of coding and
08:16 - then i'm going to take a break and we're
08:17 - going to answer some questions
08:19 - and then at the end i'll try to answer
08:21 - all the remaining questions so if you
08:22 - have questions and they're in the chat
08:24 - and i haven't got to them
08:25 - i will get to them uh
08:27 - in in a bit probably in about i don't
08:30 - know 20 minutes or so maybe less i'll go
08:32 - back to the chat
08:33 - all right but this is the game right so
08:37 - if i'm sorry if there's a lot of
08:38 - background noise my kids are all getting
08:40 - ready for school they're about to leave
08:41 - so
08:42 - um
08:43 - i don't know how much of that that mike
08:45 - is picking up
08:47 - hey buddy
08:49 - uh
08:51 - you want to say hi
08:52 - hi
08:53 - i don't know if they can see you there
08:55 - say hi hi
08:58 - all right have a good day at school but
09:02 - um
09:05 - yeah so i'm just in my basement right
09:06 - now eventually i'm going to build like a
09:08 - legit office and hopefully sound proof
09:10 - it but
09:11 - just moved in
09:12 - last week
09:15 - so anyway uh these are the styles we do
09:18 - have
09:19 - different colors for each mode right but
09:23 - we just threw these in here
09:25 - um
09:27 - this is definitely not how i want it to
09:29 - look
09:30 - uh i still
09:32 - am not exactly sure how i want it to
09:34 - look but i think there's some
09:35 - improvements that could be made
09:40 - so let's
09:42 - first thing i want to do is
09:45 - open up dev tools
09:48 - right so
09:49 - if you're not familiar with devtools uh
09:52 - the this is your best friend as a web
09:54 - developer uh devtools will allow you to
09:58 - inspect things on the page see the code
10:00 - make changes
10:03 - basically they're like previews of
10:05 - changes that only you can
10:07 - you can see hey raphael
10:10 - i'm i'm live streaming but
10:14 - my son one of my sons was back there
10:17 - just like moving all these boxes
10:19 - um
10:22 - so what i want to do is see how this
10:24 - will look on a device because
10:27 - eventually we want to make this run on a
10:29 - mobile device as well as on
10:32 - a desktop so we haven't actually checked
10:34 - to see how this would look on a device
10:37 - so let's just
10:40 - uh i don't know which one i'll pick
10:42 - let's pick a small one just to uh to get
10:44 - an idea so this actually isn't terrible
10:47 - i kind of thought it would be worse
10:48 - since we hadn't had this in mind at all
10:53 - but
10:56 - it fits wow that's
10:58 - that's cool
10:59 - it actually fits
11:02 - um
11:04 - okay
11:08 - so just looking at this right now
11:11 - uh i think for sure
11:14 - uh the numbers need to be bigger and the
11:17 - buttons need to be bigger i think the uh
11:21 - the hero character that's here and the
11:23 - enemy characters that here that are here
11:26 - can definitely be smaller
11:29 - so
11:30 - the the perspective uh
11:33 - this is a children's game
11:35 - right uh so their attention is going to
11:37 - be drawn to this when in reality like
11:39 - this there's no interactions they can
11:41 - take here
11:42 - right so we're drawing the user to
11:45 - an area that they can't actually do
11:47 - anything with
11:48 - uh so i think we can we can shrink this
11:51 - uh so
11:53 - this is this stream is going to be a
11:55 - little bit of design and dev together
11:57 - right so i'm i'm
11:59 - a software engineer i've done design
12:01 - before a bit but i'm not primarily a
12:03 - designer so usually i just jump in and
12:05 - start coding and then figure out the
12:06 - design as i go along so
12:10 - if this were a real project on a real
12:12 - team we'd probably have a design a
12:14 - designer already do the design right so
12:21 - let's
12:22 - for now let's see what this looks like
12:24 - when we shrink these up and make this
12:26 - bigger all right and i want to make sure
12:28 - anything that
12:30 - a user would click is really big right
12:33 - because it's going to be a kids game
12:35 - their their dexterity is not going to be
12:39 - as good maybe as the average user
12:42 - potentially so we want to make sure they
12:44 - don't accidentally click in the wrong
12:46 - spot so right here i can see like the
12:48 - submit button needs to be bigger and
12:50 - there needs to be more space
12:52 - right
12:53 - uh so let's let's do that now like so
12:56 - since we're in devtools we can try some
12:58 - things out here without actually even
13:00 - touching our real code
13:03 - so let's click
13:04 - on some of these
13:10 - actually
13:12 - it might be easier in this case
13:16 - so like in the case of uh
13:18 - the numbers
13:22 - we can definitely make them bigger
13:27 - let's see
13:28 - so
13:29 - we can see all the
13:32 - properties that are currently on
13:34 - like the css properties that are
13:36 - currently on this we have the font size
13:37 - of 28 pixels
13:39 - so that actually is uh
13:43 - seems pretty big but as we can see like
13:45 - it doesn't actually look that big on
13:46 - that phone um
13:49 - so if we click that it'll show us where
13:51 - in the code we have the 28 pixels now
13:53 - unfortunately since we're doing this
13:55 - with
13:56 - react native web and it's coming through
13:57 - it won't allow us to edit
14:00 - directly in line if this was just a
14:01 - normal web app
14:03 - we could um
14:05 - so we're gonna have to override it and
14:07 - let's go with
14:09 - let's go with 40 pixels it's going to
14:11 - seem pretty crazy to do 40 pixels but i
14:13 - think it'll be good
14:17 - actually
14:19 - because of the way the styles get split
14:21 - up i can't target a style so let's just
14:23 - go back to our code really quick
14:26 - in this case i think it might be easier
14:27 - to just
14:29 - mess with our code directly
14:31 - normally it is not
14:33 - so we do have all the styles down here
14:36 - and uh i forgot we were using comic sans
14:40 - we'll pro
14:41 - we may change that
14:44 - it's i think since it's a kids game it
14:46 - might work
14:48 - okay so our character
14:51 - has a width of 80 and 80. let's let's
14:54 - cut that down right let's let's give
14:56 - that
14:57 - 40
14:59 - and
15:02 - now our
15:04 - math container
15:06 - our math row so our math row has a
15:08 - padding on the bottom of eight let's
15:11 - bump that up to 16
15:14 - okay and then our text size 28 will bump
15:17 - that up to 40.
15:20 - and we do have our inputs
15:23 - of
15:24 - sporticles i believe this is our
15:28 - input for
15:35 - let's give it a 60. let's make it just a
15:37 - square we'll give it a height and width
15:39 - of 60.
15:40 - i'm i didn't finish my thoughts sorry
15:42 - that's our input
15:44 - to put the answer to the the question so
15:46 - let's save all that and then see what it
15:48 - looks like now
15:51 - okay
15:52 - so
15:53 - definitely different
15:56 - we now have
15:58 - bigger
15:59 - text here we have more space i forgot to
16:01 - make the submit button bigger
16:05 - and is this okay so we we didn't
16:08 - actually make the text bigger in here so
16:10 - what we need to do that
16:13 - and let me check my time to make sure i
16:15 - i forgot to start my timer so
16:18 - so what i started at 7 30 so we've been
16:21 - about 20 minutes now
16:24 - all right let me just get just a few
16:26 - more minutes and then i'm gonna go to
16:28 - the live chat and read through the chat
16:30 - okay
16:32 - all right so for now let's
16:35 - uh
16:37 - let's make the button
16:39 - a bit bigger
16:44 - and we'll make the text inside the input
16:46 - match with this text
16:49 - oh don't let me forget i need to check
16:52 - out cypress
16:53 - so uh our testing suite has now changed
16:56 - from using puppeteer to using cypress
16:59 - so i want to
17:01 - give you a preview of that and i forgot
17:03 - to last time
17:04 - and
17:05 - i want to try to do it for sure this
17:07 - time so
17:08 - uh that was an addition from from
17:10 - harshit who i haven't seen in the chat
17:12 - today so i don't think he's here but
17:15 - he's been a big contributor to
17:17 - um
17:18 - to my streams
17:20 - for a long time for like
17:22 - over a year
17:24 - uh
17:25 - let's see
17:29 - where's our button
17:31 - i don't think we have any styles for a
17:33 - button
17:37 - so we're gonna have to go up here and
17:38 - see
17:41 - what we can do here oh okay so we
17:44 - actually have the the default styles for
17:47 - a button so let's look up
17:49 - in the doc
17:51 - the react native documentation what the
17:53 - styles are for button
17:59 - so if you're doing a react native
18:00 - project i definitely recommend just just
18:03 - leave the react native docs open on your
18:05 - tab
18:06 - uh on on one of your tabs because
18:09 - uh
18:10 - i i reference it so much there's just no
18:12 - point in me even closing it
18:14 - so here's the button
18:16 - you'd see i'm pretty sure we just copied
18:18 - this exactly
18:20 - but what i want to see is uh all the the
18:24 - props
18:25 - uh on press how to assist with color
18:27 - disable test id prefer focus okay so
18:31 - here's our props but what i want to see
18:33 - is what kind of styles we could actually
18:34 - give this
18:36 - um
18:38 - which i don't know let's see let's just
18:40 - add some styles and see if we can give
18:42 - it one
18:43 - we may have to switch it up so
18:46 - you can use touchable opacity
18:49 - or touchable native feedback
18:51 - to give your button some custom styles
18:55 - so we may have to switch up to that
18:57 - that's what i normally end up using
18:58 - anyway
19:01 - but
19:02 - for now let's
19:03 - just see if we can do this so
19:06 - i'm just going to do an inline style
19:08 - just as a test
19:10 - so we're going to add style so in uh
19:12 - react native if you want to do an inline
19:14 - style you can
19:16 - you want to uh use an object right so
19:20 - we're doing style we're putting our
19:21 - curly brackets which means
19:23 - hey we're about to do some javascript
19:25 - and then inside of there we have another
19:26 - set of curly brackets which is just
19:28 - normal javascript right it just says
19:30 - like this is an object
19:32 - and then now we're going to do css
19:35 - as if we were writing so like
19:37 - we're converting our normal css into
19:40 - javascript's object syntax right so
19:42 - we're going to camel case everything
19:44 - uh it's key value pairs right so in this
19:47 - case
19:48 - let's just say height
19:51 - hd if i can spell it
19:53 - ht
19:55 - and
19:56 - we're going to give it
19:57 - something crazy so we just know
20:00 - uh
20:01 - we know that it works right so type 200
20:03 - so this would be obvious if it works
20:08 - and it didn't
20:09 - right so it looks like we're going to
20:11 - have to change that
20:13 - and we can't actually add a height to a
20:15 - button
20:16 - if there is some way to add height to a
20:18 - button let me know in the chat
20:20 - you know but according to the
20:22 - documentation it didn't look like we
20:24 - could i was hoping there would be like
20:27 - some props
20:29 - but it seems like the only thing you can
20:31 - really change style is this the color
20:37 - okay so i'm just going to click on
20:39 - touchable opacity so it's there
20:41 - and we can we can check that out and if
20:44 - anybody wants to read ahead i'm going to
20:45 - put this in the chat the link to
20:47 - touchable opacity if you've never used
20:49 - it before you can check out the docs
20:52 - basically you're just making something
20:54 - clickable and react native and you can
20:56 - give it whatever styles you want
21:00 - all right and
21:03 - i'm gonna take a five-minute break here
21:05 - so i'm gonna set my

21:32 - i appreciate that
21:34 - uh akeem says is this a react thing yes
21:37 - yes it's react native web so it's all
21:40 - react native syntax but we're actually
21:41 - running it as a web app
21:43 - if you want to know why we're doing like
21:45 - that watch like the first two streams
21:46 - and i i explain more of the benefits of
21:49 - doing that
21:51 - um eric says how can i find your
21:53 - javascript beginner tutorials
21:55 - so i haven't done
21:57 - a lot of tutorials myself it's mostly
21:59 - live streams and it's
22:02 - some streams are more beginner friendly
22:03 - and some streams aren't just depends on
22:05 - what we're working on that day but um
22:07 - there are some awesome beginner
22:09 - javascript tutorials on this channel
22:12 - on the free codecamp channel if you do
22:14 - want to see my tutorials check out my
22:16 - channel the links in the description
22:18 - i don't do as much with my personal
22:20 - youtube channel i'd love to do more
22:22 - just

22:42 - the dawn says bro i love this channel oh
22:44 - thanks thanks yeah the free code game
22:47 - channel is awesome like not i'm not just
22:49 - talking about my stream like
22:51 - um
22:52 - there are so many really really good
22:54 - contributors uh and just the variety and

23:08 - lot of people to get their skills up and
23:10 - get jobs like including me
23:12 - uh charming says pulling in pulling and
23:15 - installing yarn before anything in the
23:18 - morning is good advice been a victim of
23:20 - such trust me you don't want to go
23:22 - through the work before you pull yeah
23:23 - for sure
23:37 - um bell
23:40 - bellis
23:42 - sorry angelo i'm sorry i i probably
23:45 - missed your name up uh let me know how
23:46 - i'm supposed to pronounce it this is uh
23:48 - i can anime that
23:50 - uh i'm not sure where you're
23:52 - what you're for are you offering to
23:54 - animate something and so let me know
23:56 - what you mean because i'm not exactly
23:57 - sure what what you're saying
24:00 - uh
24:01 - yes you asked if i have any plans to
24:03 - work on vue.js projects not right now
24:06 - uh i've
24:08 - i'm like curious about vue but i don't
24:10 - have any immediate plans to work on them
24:13 - maybe maybe i'll do it at some point
24:16 - creative girl says hi which one do i
24:19 - have to learn flexbox css grid or maybe
24:21 - bootstrap i have no idea when you use
24:23 - them
24:24 - okay that's a good question uh there are
24:26 - some answers there uh coding technique
24:28 - says i think flexbox is easier
24:30 - um
24:33 - uh is ishmael says i will go with
24:36 - bootstrap but just know a little flexbox
24:38 - okay so they're not exactly comparable
24:40 - right so bootstrap is
24:42 - an entire
24:44 - css library
24:46 - that's
24:47 - you bring in it's css and javascript
24:50 - and there's a lot of like built-in
24:53 - classes
24:54 - that you can use to style
24:58 - an entire app
25:00 - or a website
25:02 - flexbox is a part of css
25:05 - and so is grid
25:08 - so it's a part of just normal css you
25:10 - don't have to import anything uh extra
25:13 - and it's used for positioning
25:15 - right so
25:17 - back in the day
25:18 - people use tables for positioning or we
25:21 - used floats for positioning
25:24 - but
25:25 - flex or flex box gives you a nicer way
25:29 - to position uh
25:31 - like for instance you can vertically
25:33 - center things on a page
25:35 - very easily with flexbox right that was
25:38 - always
25:39 - really hard to do before
25:42 - and not that it was impossible but it
25:44 - was just more difficult
25:47 - grid is another way
25:49 - to align things on a page so it's not
25:53 - exactly comparable
25:55 - so like if you learned all of bootstrap
25:58 - you could style an entire site if you
26:00 - learned flexbox
26:02 - you could just position things which you
26:03 - couldn't really style things so
26:07 - i say definitely
26:08 - if if you want to do react native then
26:10 - you need to know flexbox
26:13 - uh because flexbox is the default
26:16 - positioning system for react native
26:19 - so i definitely recommend using flexbox
26:21 - that's what we use
26:25 - and like bootstrap's not always going to
26:27 - be available to you
26:29 - so
26:30 - you know try to learn the the regular
26:32 - css
26:34 - it'll be easier to work on a variety of
26:36 - sites if you know css
26:39 - bootstraps should be easy to pick up
26:42 - because it's just
26:44 - basically giving you chunks of you know
26:46 - pre-written css
26:49 - attached to classes that you can add to
26:51 - your site
26:53 - so if you know really no css you'd be
26:55 - able to understand all of bootstrap
26:58 - just by looking at the css files
27:01 - and kind of know what's what's happening
27:02 - and be able to change it up and
27:06 - like customize it to what you need okay
27:09 - does that make sense let me know if it
27:10 - doesn't
27:12 - all right didn't get through everything
27:14 - but
27:15 - let me go back to
27:17 - all right here's what i'm gonna do i'm
27:18 - gonna say i'm gonna mark down here where
27:21 - i left off
27:32 - 746. i need to like adjust the
27:36 - tilt of my screen or something
27:40 - it's really hard to see
27:42 - i need new screens period i just i'm
27:45 - using some old screens that i've just
27:48 - gotten from people like when they're
27:50 - getting rid of their screens
27:54 - okay so
27:55 - let's
27:56 - how much time do we have
27:58 - okay
27:59 - so we have about a half hour left
28:02 - so here's what i'd like to accomplish in
28:04 - that half an hour
28:07 - i want to get the styling
28:14 - so i want to get this button a little
28:16 - bit bigger
28:17 - uh commit these new styles i'm not like
28:21 - obviously we're not finished with the
28:22 - styling but this is just
28:25 - a little bit of some updates
28:28 - um
28:30 - i want to demo cypress for testing
28:33 - and then i want to finish the rest of
28:34 - the questions okay so that's the that's
28:36 - the plan
28:38 - so let's switch this up to use touchable
28:41 - opacity first
28:42 - so we can see in with touchable opacity
28:46 - obviously instead of using body button
28:48 - we're replacing it with this but then
28:50 - also we can put things inside of it
28:52 - and in fact we we need to put things
28:54 - inside of it
28:56 - so let me show you what i mean
29:00 - so right now our button we can say like
29:03 - the title is submit and look there's
29:04 - there's nothing there's no children to
29:06 - this button
29:07 - when we switch it to touchable opacity
29:09 - if we did this
29:11 - nothing would appear on the page right
29:13 - so
29:14 - we need to give it children
29:16 - for instance to to say like hey here's
29:18 - what you should display inside of this
29:21 - button
29:22 - all right so let's switch that up now
29:24 - and go to the top of the file and where
29:26 - we have button
29:30 - let's change it to
29:37 - touchable opacity
29:39 - should have changed up here too yep
29:41 - okay we're going to change it to
29:42 - touchable opacity now i know i'm going
29:44 - to need something in here and i will
29:46 - need text
29:48 - and let's say
29:52 - oh wait is this our oh this was our
29:54 - restart button oh
29:57 - i changed the wrong thing
29:58 - i forgot we had i i totally forgot we
30:01 - had a restart button all right
30:03 - let's do that again
30:05 - let's keep button in there because i
30:06 - don't want to mess with the restart
30:08 - button right now just
30:10 - because i want to finish on time right
30:12 - uh so let's
30:17 - touchable opacity
30:19 - now let's find the right button this
30:21 - time
30:23 - where are we at
30:24 - okay
30:26 - whoa actually did we
30:29 - yeah yeah this is what we did for a
30:30 - second i was like have we been working
30:32 - on the wrong button the whole time
30:34 - but i don't think so
30:37 - all right so touchable opacity
30:40 - and now we're going to say
30:44 - text
30:46 - submit
30:48 - and then we're going to close out
30:50 - touchable opacity
30:52 - okay now
30:55 - let me just say so we'll just see what
30:57 - shows up on the page now before we do
30:59 - anything else
31:02 - so you can see it's it's just the button
31:04 - right so it should still work so like
31:08 - right there's no
31:10 - um
31:12 - and you know what i just thought of we
31:13 - should uh not allow a submit
31:16 - if there's nothing in here
31:18 - i can see that being really frustrating
31:20 - for a child if they accidentally hit
31:22 - submit and haven't even put anything in
31:24 - there
31:26 - and then another enemy comes like that
31:28 - especially if a child is really
31:30 - struggling with their math and it would
31:32 - like almost be
31:34 - beat it and they know what the answer is
31:35 - and they just accidentally hit submit
31:37 - like that could be devastating for a
31:39 - little kid right like so let's make that
31:42 - happen so that we check to make sure
31:44 - that basically if there is nothing in
31:47 - this box we don't allow submit all right
31:49 - we're not going to do that right now but
31:51 - um
31:52 - let's just keep that in mind and add
31:54 - that in at some point
31:56 - if somebody wants to make an issue for
31:57 - that feel free to make an issue i'll try
31:59 - to remember and make an issue for it
32:01 - later
32:03 - uh okay so we need to style this this
32:05 - submit button right
32:08 - so you can see like our color
32:11 - you know that's not
32:13 - that's not going to work right
32:16 - we do someone to keep this test id i
32:18 - believe the title
32:21 - is not going to matter here
32:23 - we can double check
32:24 - that there is no title attribute
32:28 - let's see if it shows us
32:30 - yeah so our props here style active
32:32 - opacity
32:34 - yeah okay
32:35 - hmm
32:42 - actually this is kind of weird why do we
32:44 - have
32:52 - it's weird that they don't list on press
32:57 - under this
32:58 - i guess maybe they're just like assuming
33:02 - that you would have that but anyway
33:06 - we can remove
33:12 - where are we at oops here's our code
33:17 - you can definitely remove the color uh
33:19 - let's give this a style though
33:23 - style equals
33:25 - and let's say styles dot
33:30 - we'll just call this button for now
33:32 - i know we're gonna have we have more
33:34 - than one button but we'll just say
33:36 - styles.button
33:37 - and
33:39 - i'm going to group this
33:41 - i'm going to put this under input since
33:43 - it appears under the input
33:47 - all right so we need to give this
33:50 - like a height a width a background color
33:53 - right so
33:56 - let's say our height is going to be
33:59 - 40 pixels so we always want to at least
34:01 - go 40 for touches you know let's go
34:04 - um
34:06 - let's at least bump it up to 50 right i
34:08 - want to make this bigger than you would
34:10 - normally make it for an adult
34:12 - uh
34:13 - like i said i know kids fingers are
34:15 - smaller but
34:16 - they may be a bit more clumsy
34:21 - okay button
34:24 - height uh
34:25 - with let's just go with with
34:28 - like 100 for now
34:33 - let's see how it looks and then
34:35 - background color
34:36 - we can give it that same color that we
34:38 - had
34:40 - i'm not like a huge fan of that color
34:41 - but
34:43 - i don't
34:46 - really have any other color in mind so
34:48 - we might as well just use it
34:55 - okay
34:57 - let's see what that gives us now
35:03 - hey look we've got
35:04 - got a button
35:06 - okay you could see like look it's still
35:09 - just totally bare bones the the submit
35:11 - is
35:12 - not even centered so let's work on this
35:15 - submit as well
35:20 - yeah
35:21 - okay
35:22 - uh so
35:26 - we can actually set this to
35:31 - display
35:32 - i don't know if i should i don't think i
35:34 - need to put display flex on here but
35:36 - let's see so let's say justify content
35:40 - center and align
35:43 - items
35:45 - oops
35:48 - center so this is flexbox so this is
35:51 - what i'm talking about when i say
35:52 - flexbox makes
35:55 - vertically aligning things easy so this
35:57 - is going to vertically and horizontally
36:00 - center
36:02 - submit hopefully let's see
36:04 - yep here we go so now it was up here now
36:08 - it is both vertically and horizontally
36:10 - centered so easy
36:14 - especially if you remember
36:16 - everything that you had to go through to
36:18 - make this happen before flexbox
36:21 - so much easier
36:23 - all right now we want to make
36:28 - our
36:32 - our text
36:35 - a little bit more readable so we're
36:37 - definitely going to give it a color of
36:39 - let's just say white for now
36:44 - all right so fff is going to give us
36:46 - white
36:47 - uh that's the the hex code
36:49 - and
36:51 - let's make the font size
36:56 - so the button itself is what's
36:59 - 50 so let's make our font size
37:02 - 40.
37:04 - i definitely don't want it to be bigger
37:06 - and let's see what it looks like
37:09 - oops we didn't apply it to the text so
37:12 - on the text here let's say
37:16 - style equals styles
37:21 - dot
37:23 - button
37:24 - text
37:30 - whoa
37:31 - okay
37:32 - we need to make that wider
37:34 - and okay
37:38 - yeah definitely need to make it wider
37:42 - and probably taller
37:53 - all right so the button now is 100 uh
37:56 - let's double it to 200
37:59 - and
38:01 - let's make its height 60.
38:10 - okay that's more reasonable
38:12 - it's still not like a spectacular
38:14 - looking button
38:16 - but
38:17 - it does have a little effect right it
38:20 - has this little kind of flash thing
38:22 - right
38:23 - um
38:24 - and it still works
38:28 - all right i tell you truth like i i'm
38:31 - not thrilled with the way this button
38:32 - turned out but
38:35 - but it allows us to customize it so
38:38 - we can further customize this as we we
38:41 - need to right
38:51 - uh let's see
38:56 - yeah that
38:58 - i'm kind of thinking that the submit
39:00 - button is like dominating the page now
39:02 - i mean i do want to keep track of my
39:04 - time okay but
39:06 - uh
39:09 - i think i'm at a point now where
39:13 - i want to commit this
39:15 - uh and
39:16 - and then check out the testing suite so
39:18 - that i have enough time to get to the
39:21 - um
39:22 - like the the messages uh the chat
39:25 - messages
39:26 - okay so
39:32 - so if if you're totally a beginner and
39:35 - you're not really familiar with version
39:36 - control uh we're using get
39:40 - okay so we have a
39:43 - git status
39:46 - and that tells us what's changed right
39:47 - we've only really worked on one file
39:49 - right so
39:50 - that's to be expected and now we're
39:52 - gonna do a git commit
39:56 - i'm going to give it an am flag
39:59 - okay
40:00 - and then i'm going to put the commit
40:02 - message so
40:04 - i'm going to say feature um
40:11 - this is like a terrible message uh but
40:14 - we we just adjusted styles right so
40:18 - let's commit that and now we can do a
40:20 - get push
40:23 - right and
40:24 - that's gonna push that up to github
40:26 - right
40:27 - okay
40:29 - so that's like very very basic of using
40:32 - get you commit and then you push
40:35 - um
40:37 - now we basically have a save point
40:40 - for our code that we could always go
40:42 - back to that point
40:43 - later on so if we totally mess things up
40:46 - in the next stream it's okay because we
40:48 - could always go back to this point
40:51 - all right now let's check out our
40:53 - package json for a second
40:56 - and see
40:57 - that we have
40:58 - this e2e script
41:01 - all right and that's going to open up
41:02 - cyprus and run some tests
41:05 - okay so let's let's check this out
41:08 - so we're going to run yarn e to e
41:13 - and like i haven't really used cyprus
41:15 - yet so harshit set this up
41:18 - um
41:21 - i think it's really cool i did run it
41:23 - once just to see what it did
41:27 - uh but it's definitely something that i
41:29 - want to learn more about uh because it's
41:31 - pretty cool so while this is doing its
41:33 - thing which
41:35 - why is this taking there we go
41:40 - so you see this is definitely different
41:41 - than what we had in the test before
41:42 - before our tests would just run and you
41:45 - know display some things here in the
41:47 - console but this is
41:51 - bringing up this whole ui right so it
41:54 - says here's our test
41:56 - here's our file right oops
41:59 - this is the following place
42:03 - cool
42:04 - all right so i click that and now it's
42:06 - running i didn't mean to actually run
42:07 - them but so i clicked on that file and
42:10 - you can see it's run all the tests in
42:11 - that file so we only have one file with
42:13 - the test i'm assuming if we had more it
42:15 - would show all the tests and we could
42:17 - run them all at once if we wanted
42:19 - okay but if you saw some flashes up on
42:22 - the screen
42:23 - of
42:24 - basically it it was running this
42:27 - and and going through the motions of
42:29 - clicking everything
42:31 - and it says we can see a title we can
42:33 - see hero and we can we get the
42:37 - if we do a correct addition answer it
42:40 - reduces the enemies by one right so we
42:42 - don't have a lot of tests in there
42:44 - but it's kind of cool to have a ui as
42:47 - well
42:48 - i know some of the people i work with
42:51 - on my team are way more familiar with ui
42:54 - stuff as opposed to like doing things
42:56 - through the command line uh so it
42:58 - definitely could be helpful
43:00 - um to be able to have that that visual
43:03 - uh of this
43:04 - so
43:06 - i can see you've no recorded run
43:08 - yeah so there's a lot of stuff in here
43:11 - that i haven't even messed with
43:14 - wow okay so there's all your settings in
43:16 - here so i mean this is really cool so
43:18 - definitely check this out if you need to
43:20 - do react testing
43:24 - wow really cool all right uh
43:28 - so i'm not gonna go more into that yet
43:29 - because i myself don't know that much
43:31 - about it so i'd rather not mislead you
43:33 - but i promised harshit that i would demo
43:36 - it so definitely uh you know check that
43:38 - out it looks cool it does give us some
43:40 - output in the command line as well
43:43 - um
43:45 - all right
43:47 - let's
43:50 - let's go back to the chat so i've left
43:52 - about 15 minutes
43:54 - before i have to end the show for chat
43:57 - so i hope i can get through everything
44:00 - uh before i have to end it
44:03 - and
44:05 - where'd i do that okay so i ended about
44:08 - there in the chat about 6 46 my time
44:13 - there we go
44:16 - okay
44:18 - and i'm gonna i didn't really display
44:20 - what's changed in our package json so
44:21 - i'm just going to put that up here
44:24 - uh really the dev dispen dependencies
44:26 - change we have cypress
44:28 - and our eslint plug-in for cypress
44:31 - and all the stuff with like mocha and
44:35 - chai and puppeteer are gone
44:41 - all right so let's get to these
44:42 - questions
44:46 - uh
44:47 - ab
44:48 - abdullahi says i am fresh to programming
44:51 - and i don't know where to start uh check
44:53 - out freecodecam.org and just start out
44:56 - with with some of the lessons there it's
44:57 - totally free
44:59 - uh just create a free account
45:02 - and like free code camp's never going to
45:04 - try to sell you anything we're not going
45:06 - to spam you with ads nothing like that
45:08 - so just check it out start doing some of
45:10 - the the
45:11 - um
45:12 - the lessons there and see how you like
45:14 - it
45:15 - um
45:18 - web noob says in response to creative
45:20 - girl's question about flexbox and
45:22 - bootstrap and grid says everything is
45:24 - important to learn it yeah i mean
45:27 - ultimately yeah it's great to know
45:29 - everything but i would say like don't
45:30 - don't get overwhelmed thinking that you
45:32 - have to learn everything you definitely
45:33 - don't you know if you just pick
45:35 - something and learn it
45:37 - you're fine right so um
45:41 - i would just try not to be anxious about
45:44 - what to learn what to learn first and in
45:47 - what order
45:48 - uh
45:49 - you know just just learning something
45:51 - and being able to work with it is great
45:52 - like a ton of websites use bootstrap if
45:54 - you just know bootstrap there's a ton of
45:57 - work out there um the same way like if
46:00 - you just know flexbox you don't know
46:01 - bootstrap or grid you can still do a lot
46:03 - of awesome things like so
46:05 - basically my point is like as long as
46:08 - you're learning something
46:10 - that's you're good you know you're
46:12 - already going in the right direction you
46:13 - know and you'll learn more eventually
46:15 - just you know it takes time
46:23 - jimmy says guys please can you help me
46:25 - out how can i animate a button on long
46:27 - press um
46:30 - i'm not exactly sure that would be
46:32 - something i'd have to look up myself so
46:33 - i can't give you an answer right now
46:36 - but maybe somebody else in the in the
46:38 - chat can
46:42 - web noob says uh hey jesse are you
46:45 - teaching your kids and programming can't
46:46 - wait to try with my son
46:48 - yeah so actually i i do
46:51 - so we have like some little kid
46:53 - programming books
46:54 - uh that we we read to the kids sometimes
46:59 - and um
47:01 - we have trying to make what it's called
47:03 - uh tinker so we have a tinker
47:06 - subscription
47:07 - uh so i think it's like tinker.com or
47:09 - something and they have coding exercises
47:11 - for kids
47:12 - and so
47:14 - our my kids do that
47:16 - so we've tried out some other ones too
47:18 - um but
47:20 - my son especially my oldest my
47:22 - nine-year-old seems to really like the
47:24 - tinker stuff and he works on it all the
47:25 - time
47:27 - so yeah so we're we're trying to teach
47:28 - him and not like pushing them into that
47:31 - into it but you know just kind of
47:34 - providing them with books and
47:37 - uh you know like lessons and stuff so
47:39 - it's there if they want to want it you
47:41 - know and they're just excited about
47:43 - using a computer
47:45 - so
47:46 - if i tell them like well the only way
47:48 - you can use computers if you're doing
47:49 - the coding stuff then usually that's
47:52 - enough and and they do it
47:57 - uh let's say
47:59 - uh
48:01 - bob
48:02 - i'm i'm really sorry i'm not pronouncing
48:04 - your name right uh but
48:06 - says are you using the windows subsystem
48:08 - for linux
48:09 - uh
48:11 - no so i am using bash on windows but i'm
48:14 - not i haven't done anything with the
48:17 - the subsystem yet
48:20 - it's uh gaming says hello everyone hey
48:22 - how's it going
48:28 - let's see
48:31 - oh cool so
48:33 - michael creel uh answered my question
48:35 - about the button and unfortunately i
48:37 - didn't look over to see that but thanks
48:38 - michael it basically says from stack
48:40 - overflow this component has limited
48:42 - options so you can't resize it to a
48:43 - fixed height
48:45 - all right
48:46 - so uh
48:48 - so that is true so basically we we did
48:50 - have to switch the button over to a
48:53 - touchable opacity in order to
48:56 - basically change anything except the
48:58 - color and text
49:02 - um
49:04 - for
49:04 - fargentius says
49:06 - uh are you doing the mobile or web
49:10 - yeah so right now we're doing
49:12 - web
49:13 - but
49:14 - we're gonna switch it over to mobile so
49:17 - let me give you an update on that
49:18 - actually so i'd like to use expo
49:21 - to help us uh
49:23 - test and build the mobile versions but
49:26 - unfortunately
49:27 - so
49:29 - all right let me give some background to
49:30 - explain this so like
49:32 - expo just takes has its own fork of
49:35 - react native right uh and
49:38 - it allows you to create react native
49:39 - apps more easily it comes with a lot of
49:41 - built-in things to to like developer
49:45 - tools
49:47 - and like different components that work
49:50 - with
49:52 - like hardware on a phone
49:53 - on a device
49:56 - so i'd love to use expo because it comes
49:57 - with all that but
49:59 - since expo has its own fork of react
50:01 - native it's behind a little bit so it's
50:03 - not the latest version so the latest
50:05 - version of react native allows you to
50:07 - use react hooks which we are using
50:10 - right but the expo version of react
50:14 - native doesn't yet
50:16 - support hooks
50:18 - so if we try to use expo right now
50:22 - we would have to switch to not use hooks
50:24 - and that would be a lot of refactoring
50:26 - and i don't want to refactor it back to
50:28 - that i'd rather use hooks so the plan is
50:31 - this
50:32 - i'm going to keep developing
50:34 - the
50:36 - web version
50:38 - i'm going to keep the mobile styles in
50:39 - mind like by using dev tools and
50:41 - mimicking the
50:43 - phone right
50:45 - but we're not actually going to test it
50:47 - on a device we're going to wait for the
50:49 - next update to expo which should allow
50:52 - us to use hooks then we'll pull in expo
50:55 - into our project
50:57 - and
50:58 - we'll be able to run
50:59 - the web version the mobile version the
51:02 - mobile in a simulator
51:04 - side by side so that we make a change we
51:07 - can immediately see how it impacts both
51:09 - the web and mobile versions
51:13 - so hopefully that makes sense
51:16 - we could just use straight up react
51:18 - native and run it like that but like i i
51:22 - really do like everything the additional
51:24 - stuff that expo uses so i'd rather just
51:27 - wait on that
51:28 - if it seems like it's gonna take a
51:30 - really long time then maybe we'll
51:32 - rethink that strategy but that's where
51:34 - i'm at right now so the mobile's coming
51:38 - we're just kind of waiting on the next
51:39 - expo update
51:41 - if anybody had knows like if you've been
51:43 - keeping track of the updates to expo and
51:45 - you have some insight into when that's
51:47 - gonna happen let me know
51:50 - last week or something i did read up on
51:52 - it
51:53 - and at least at that point i don't think
51:55 - there was an exact time for the next
51:57 - release
52:04 - saeed says love you bro
52:06 - oh thanks i love you too
52:09 - um
52:10 - let's see
52:16 - vedant says this channel is great
52:19 - um
52:21 - manu says well thanks thanks i
52:23 - appreciate that man who says please
52:25 - suggest um
52:28 - all right let me hold on let me read
52:29 - this question
52:32 - says i'm i'm intermediate in javascript
52:35 - but i can't build up logics what should
52:37 - i do
52:38 - um
52:41 - i check out some of the more advanced
52:44 - javascript uh problems in
52:47 - free code camp
52:49 - so freecodecam.org i check those out i
52:51 - know i keep recommending free code camp
52:53 - but
52:54 - it's just quality stuff and it's totally
52:56 - free right if you feel like you need
52:58 - more then maybe you know go look at some
53:00 - of the paid things out there
53:03 - but
53:03 - free code camp's always a great place to
53:05 - start there's always links to additional
53:07 - resources on the free code camp lessons
53:09 - so you can go and read more if if you
53:12 - want to but i would say yeah check those
53:15 - out it's gonna you know give you some
53:17 - algorithm problems
53:19 - uh and practice is really
53:22 - i mean that's how you build up your
53:23 - skills
53:26 - so just keep at it um it'll it'll be
53:29 - tough it's it's tough for me
53:31 - um
53:33 - to do the algorithm stuff and kind of
53:35 - the more advanced um like logic based
53:37 - stuff right because as a
53:39 - primarily like web mobile developer you
53:43 - know you're not doing a lot of algorithm
53:44 - based stuff so you don't normally get
53:46 - practice you kind of have to go out of
53:48 - your way to keep up and practice that
53:50 - stuff
53:55 - um jm says have you ever told your
53:57 - youtube audience about how you got into
53:59 - coding your challenges obstacles how you
54:00 - got your first job etc um it would be of
54:03 - interest to us newbies so i have a
54:05 - little so check out my youtube channel
54:07 - the link in this is in the description i
54:09 - have done some videos on like my
54:12 - background and how i got into that so go
54:14 - ahead and check that out
54:15 - um
54:17 - if you
54:18 - check that out and like there's
54:19 - something more specific you want me to
54:20 - talk about let me know and maybe i can
54:22 - make a video about that as well but yeah
54:25 - that's a good question and so i do have
54:27 - kind of a basic overview of
54:30 - how i got into coding
54:32 - um so that should
54:35 - kind of highlight a lot of that
54:47 - oh goodness um
54:50 - somebody said in response to the
54:51 - question about building up skills and
54:53 - logic and stuff uh
54:56 - somebody gave the response of just give
54:58 - up if you can't build logic then coding
54:59 - is not really your thing
55:01 - um so number one i would say please
55:03 - don't do comments like that you know
55:05 - we're trying to help each other out
55:07 - uh so
55:10 - i i don't really want comments like that
55:11 - let's keep it positive
55:13 - secondly
55:14 - like i'm gonna say it again like
55:15 - practice is the difference between
55:17 - people that can do things and people
55:19 - they can't right there's not like
55:22 - you know
55:23 - some people do have more natural ability
55:25 - one way or another or maybe their
55:27 - background gives them more ability but
55:30 - it's still if you practice you can get
55:32 - there so
55:34 - uh
55:36 - if something is really hard that doesn't
55:37 - mean you should give up it doesn't mean
55:39 - you can't do it right it just means you
55:42 - need more practice right that's
55:44 - that's it so yeah don't don't give up
55:47 - uh if this is what you want to do
55:49 - then keep at it right
55:52 - um
55:54 - and
55:55 - uh
55:58 - just don't get discouraged i you know
56:00 - it's easy to say don't get discouraged
56:01 - but just
56:02 - realize that like
56:04 - everyone goes through
56:06 - times where they feel like they just
56:08 - can't figure things out like i was
56:10 - working on a bug
56:11 - on my work project and trying to get
56:13 - something to work for
56:15 - like over a week just trying and trying
56:18 - and everything i tried just didn't work
56:20 - and i just felt like
56:22 - i was never going to figure this out
56:25 - and then
56:26 - then i did
56:27 - and it works it was and it was awesome
56:29 - and my team was excited and my boss took
56:32 - me to his boss and said here demo this
56:35 - thing right it was awesome
56:37 - all right and and but i really thought
56:40 - you know just just like two days before
56:44 - i was like in despair of ever finding a
56:47 - solution right so it's just like you
56:50 - know keep going
56:51 - and
56:55 - you find a solution right i think people
56:57 - that have been doing this for a long
56:58 - time realize that
57:01 - you will always find a solution
57:02 - eventually
57:04 - so you know don't give up
57:06 - so
57:08 - um but just in general everybody try to
57:11 - keep things positive here you know
57:12 - there's enough depressing stuff out
57:14 - there in the world i don't want this
57:16 - stream to add to that
57:24 - okay
57:32 - um icram says anyone know any materials
57:34 - about music recommendation systems which
57:36 - could be helpful to my college project
57:39 - uh i'm really sorry um
57:43 - i don't know anything about that so i
57:46 - won't be able to help you hopefully
57:47 - somebody in the chat can
57:50 - um
57:58 - okay
58:18 - all right so
58:20 - jay says i'm confused between android
58:22 - and react what can i start for job
58:24 - purpose
58:26 - um
58:28 - okay so
58:29 - react
58:30 - is used normally for web apps right
58:33 - react native can be used for android
58:35 - apps
58:37 - so
58:38 - you could start out by just learning
58:40 - react and then transition into react
58:43 - native to build things for android as
58:45 - well so it kind of depends on what you
58:46 - want to do
58:47 - if you know you just want to be an
58:49 - android developer then maybe you you
58:51 - just learn android development and just
58:53 - don't worry about react at all
58:56 - but react is going to allow you to
58:58 - develop things for more devices
59:02 - more
59:02 - platforms so that may be a better path
59:06 - for a job but like it just kind of
59:08 - depends really on what you want to do
59:11 - aman asks can you use react navigation
59:13 - with react native web
59:17 - um
59:18 - so yeah so the navigation is a little
59:20 - bit tricky uh
59:22 - so
59:23 - you can use any navigation that will
59:26 - work on the web with react native web
59:29 - but
59:30 - when you want to also do it on mobile
59:33 - you'd have to have an alternate
59:35 - navigation system that would work with
59:37 - mobile
59:38 - so um
59:39 - i'm actually i'm working with navigation
59:41 - systems on
59:44 - another project right now that's react
59:46 - native web and
59:48 - so right now
59:50 - for the web navigation we're using
59:54 - uh react router
59:58 - but for mobile
60:01 - it's
60:02 - really like we have no mobile navigation
60:05 - system set up we're just kind of using
60:07 - state to navigate so like it's if that
60:10 - is a little bit tricky um
60:12 - i don't know of a
60:15 - navigation system that would work for
60:17 - both
60:18 - as of right now
60:20 - i'm hopeful there is one because i'd
60:21 - like to use it uh but to be honest i
60:24 - need to do more research on it as well
60:34 - all right i mean listen i do want to say
60:36 - like so i can see the the conversation
60:38 - from earlier that kind of got
60:40 - took a wrong turn there is going on so
60:43 - everybody just kind of like chill so
60:45 - um
60:47 - they don't like
60:49 - uh you like you're cool just like kind
60:52 - of like please don't tell people to give
60:54 - up
60:55 - um and then everybody else that's
60:57 - getting on vadon like
60:59 - let's just
61:00 - be cool about it too right like
61:03 - um
61:06 - and let's kind of just let it go for now
61:09 - all right
61:15 - okay
61:17 - michael creel says uh regarding coding
61:20 - with your kids have you tried scratch
61:22 - yes we have done some stuff with scratch
61:24 - that's really cool
61:25 - uh so if you haven't done anything with
61:27 - scratch even if you're an adult coder
61:29 - like check it out it's actually pretty
61:30 - fun
61:31 - um it's kind of like a drag and drop
61:33 - coding interface it's it's cool
61:40 - michael says if you have an android
61:42 - device you can plug it put it in a debug
61:44 - mode connect it to your computer and
61:45 - then dev tools can let you interact live
61:47 - with your phone
61:48 - um yeah that's yeah we have done that
61:50 - i've done that before um
61:54 - so yeah we may end up doing that but i
61:55 - do i want to do something in a way that
61:58 - uh everybody can see it on the stream so
62:00 - i don't want to run stuff on my device
62:06 - let's see
62:17 - oh cool so oman is researching
62:19 - navigation system that works on both
62:21 - okay cool i'll uh
62:23 - if you find anything let me know i i
62:25 - definitely want to want to know more
62:26 - about that
62:28 - um
62:31 - oh okay michael cruz is saying that it
62:33 - shows up live in devtools so maybe that
62:35 - might be something we could do where i
62:36 - could test it on my android uh it would
62:39 - show up live in devtools so you all
62:41 - could see it as well
62:42 - okay so maybe we'll have to to do that
62:45 - um
62:46 - robert boy uh best language to learn for
62:48 - beginners
62:49 - um
62:52 - it depends on what you want really um
62:54 - which you really want to learn but
62:56 - assuming you have no preference for what
62:58 - you want to try to do
62:59 - i'm going to say javascript because you
63:02 - can run javascript in a browser
63:04 - um
63:06 - and
63:07 - you don't need anything special on your
63:10 - uh on your computer right
63:13 - so uh
63:16 - try that out like
63:19 - if you if you know you want to do
63:21 - something different like if you're not
63:23 - interested in web development at all
63:25 - then like don't mess around with
63:26 - javascript right
63:28 - um but
63:30 - if you
63:31 - think you might
63:33 - want to do something that has to do with
63:34 - web development then go with javascript
63:37 - because you're going to have to learn it
63:38 - at some point anyway if you want to do
63:40 - web dev
63:42 - all right uh
63:45 - okay so i went over a little bit uh but
63:47 - i did get all the questions in so anyway
63:50 - uh i guess we'll be
63:52 - we'll wrap things up now
63:55 - i feel like i'm forgetting something
63:58 - but i think we did everything all right
64:00 - so
64:01 - thank you all so much for watching
64:03 - i'm not gonna be able to stream on
64:05 - friday because i'm gonna be at a
64:07 - conference so i'll be at the star trek
64:08 - conference in columbus ohio here in the
64:11 - in the u.s
64:13 - so
64:14 - i believe my talk from that conference
64:16 - is going to be online so whenever it
64:18 - gets posted online i'll i'll mention it
64:20 - in the chat and i'll probably post it on
64:21 - my social media and stuff so if you
64:24 - liked what you saw here

65:02 - then have a great week and uh thanks
65:04 - again for watching

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to do some styling and some ui changes to make this app look a little nicer as you can see there's no video right now so i don't know why uh i i moved so i moved into my new house i unplugged everything moved all my computers over plugged it back in and my webcam now does not work so i'm installing some stuff from the manufacturer that hopefully will help it says it's going to finish in about a minute so the video may turn on it may not but you all don't watch this for my face anyway um so let's get started uh as long as you can see the screen and hear me i think that's uh that's good enough um i'm gonna check real quick and see what everyone's saying in the chat um hey everybody see a lot of people just saying hi how's it going okay let's bring up the app first so that everybody who hasn't seen it yet can at least see it um also sorry the the installation just finished so let's see oh okay no i don't want to sign up for this okay wow all right so i don't think that did anything because nothing happened hey we've got something that's weird huh there we go it works all right let's move it over so it's all right spot there we go okay so i i guess it was just a driver or something um you can see my background has changed so this is my new place um i'm thinking about getting a fish tank back there so i have a fish tank with some goldfish i haven't moved it yet so i don't know let me know what you think if you want to see my goldfish behind me anyway all right let's get started so i do want to give a shout out to chris who did a awesome pull request so let's do uh get pool this is going to pull down all those changes from the port so you can see like the the code changed immediately there um so this is decently significant pull requests especially considering the project's still small this is uh quite a few changes so thank you chris uh we're also gonna do yarn this is a good practice anytime you start a project or i'm sorry anytime you're working on a project first thing you should do um is do a get pull as soon as you you start working on it in the morning you know do get pool do um and then run yarn or npm install that way you know you have the latest you know changes and and the packages right like i've forgotten this before um and i start working realize i don't have the latest changes and then there's like merge conflicts and stuff or i do remember to pull but i don't remember to to run yarn and install the packages and then i get all these errors uh and for a second i'm freaking out before i realized that oh i i just didn't install the new packages so let's start so let's start this up that way we could see the app uh so we'll be able to see it and also let's go to the pull requests so the issues now there's only two issues left i'm sure we'll we'll be able to add some more but we're going to close pull requests and check out this one right so i'm not gonna go through all of this just so that we have time for coding but check this out the link to the uh the repo is in the description so you can check out but basically this fixes two problems one we had said that we don't want the user to get the same question in a row like the exact same question twice in a row also we don't want when you're doing subtraction we don't want subtraction to result in a negative number at least not in in the first the first level uh also it found some bugs that i didn't realize were happening and fix those as well so that's awesome you can check that out there you can check out all the files that it have changed um add a little bit to the the prettier config which is nice i'll probably set up some like automatic linting so that anytime anyone tries to commit code it'll auto lint it and let me know if you want to see how to do that i can do it on a stream otherwise maybe i just try to do it you know on my own and just have it set up but it is kind of a cool setup i usually do it for all my projects and it it avoids having uh like weird commits where you have uh it looks like you have a lot of changes but they're not really changes it's just like formatting things like a semicolon or not using a semicolon or weird spaces so anyway um oh i have some questions about that uh auto link so when i say like auto linting and auto formatting i just mean like as soon as you would do like a git commit there'd be a precommit hook that would run and it would go through all your code it would check it to make sure the syntax is correct according to rules that we set up and then if it's possible for it to just automatically change your code to use the rules we set up it will do that so it's it's pretty cool it keeps a nice standard and it makes it so that if you want to contribute to this project you don't have to learn all the rules you just code how you like to code and then whenever you go to commit it'll change it all and it looks like there is some interest so yeah i'll definitely show you how to do that um maybe on the next stream that's what that's what i'll do so yeah it's a cool little setup and uh let's see i lost my train of thought what were you doing oh i wanted to show everybody the app okay just so you know um the way this is going to go we're going to do a little bit of coding and then i'm going to take a break and we're going to answer some questions and then at the end i'll try to answer all the remaining questions so if you have questions and they're in the chat and i haven't got to them i will get to them uh in in a bit probably in about i don't know 20 minutes or so maybe less i'll go back to the chat all right but this is the game right so if i'm sorry if there's a lot of background noise my kids are all getting ready for school they're about to leave so um i don't know how much of that that mike is picking up hey buddy uh you want to say hi hi i don't know if they can see you there say hi hi all right have a good day at school but um yeah so i'm just in my basement right now eventually i'm going to build like a legit office and hopefully sound proof it but just moved in last week so anyway uh these are the styles we do have different colors for each mode right but we just threw these in here um this is definitely not how i want it to look uh i still am not exactly sure how i want it to look but i think there's some improvements that could be made so let's first thing i want to do is open up dev tools right so if you're not familiar with devtools uh the this is your best friend as a web developer uh devtools will allow you to inspect things on the page see the code make changes basically they're like previews of changes that only you can you can see hey raphael i'm i'm live streaming but my son one of my sons was back there just like moving all these boxes um so what i want to do is see how this will look on a device because eventually we want to make this run on a mobile device as well as on a desktop so we haven't actually checked to see how this would look on a device so let's just uh i don't know which one i'll pick let's pick a small one just to uh to get an idea so this actually isn't terrible i kind of thought it would be worse since we hadn't had this in mind at all but it fits wow that's that's cool it actually fits um okay so just looking at this right now uh i think for sure uh the numbers need to be bigger and the buttons need to be bigger i think the uh the hero character that's here and the enemy characters that here that are here can definitely be smaller so the the perspective uh this is a children's game right uh so their attention is going to be drawn to this when in reality like this there's no interactions they can take here right so we're drawing the user to an area that they can't actually do anything with uh so i think we can we can shrink this uh so this is this stream is going to be a little bit of design and dev together right so i'm i'm a software engineer i've done design before a bit but i'm not primarily a designer so usually i just jump in and start coding and then figure out the design as i go along so if this were a real project on a real team we'd probably have a design a designer already do the design right so let's for now let's see what this looks like when we shrink these up and make this bigger all right and i want to make sure anything that a user would click is really big right because it's going to be a kids game their their dexterity is not going to be as good maybe as the average user potentially so we want to make sure they don't accidentally click in the wrong spot so right here i can see like the submit button needs to be bigger and there needs to be more space right uh so let's let's do that now like so since we're in devtools we can try some things out here without actually even touching our real code so let's click on some of these actually it might be easier in this case so like in the case of uh the numbers we can definitely make them bigger let's see so we can see all the properties that are currently on like the css properties that are currently on this we have the font size of 28 pixels so that actually is uh seems pretty big but as we can see like it doesn't actually look that big on that phone um so if we click that it'll show us where in the code we have the 28 pixels now unfortunately since we're doing this with react native web and it's coming through it won't allow us to edit directly in line if this was just a normal web app we could um so we're gonna have to override it and let's go with let's go with 40 pixels it's going to seem pretty crazy to do 40 pixels but i think it'll be good actually because of the way the styles get split up i can't target a style so let's just go back to our code really quick in this case i think it might be easier to just mess with our code directly normally it is not so we do have all the styles down here and uh i forgot we were using comic sans we'll pro we may change that it's i think since it's a kids game it might work okay so our character has a width of 80 and 80. let's let's cut that down right let's let's give that 40 and now our math container our math row so our math row has a padding on the bottom of eight let's bump that up to 16 okay and then our text size 28 will bump that up to 40. and we do have our inputs of sporticles i believe this is our input for let's give it a 60. let's make it just a square we'll give it a height and width of 60. i'm i didn't finish my thoughts sorry that's our input to put the answer to the the question so let's save all that and then see what it looks like now okay so definitely different we now have bigger text here we have more space i forgot to make the submit button bigger and is this okay so we we didn't actually make the text bigger in here so what we need to do that and let me check my time to make sure i i forgot to start my timer so so what i started at 7 30 so we've been about 20 minutes now all right let me just get just a few more minutes and then i'm gonna go to the live chat and read through the chat okay all right so for now let's uh let's make the button a bit bigger and we'll make the text inside the input match with this text oh don't let me forget i need to check out cypress so uh our testing suite has now changed from using puppeteer to using cypress so i want to give you a preview of that and i forgot to last time and i want to try to do it for sure this time so uh that was an addition from from harshit who i haven't seen in the chat today so i don't think he's here but he's been a big contributor to um to my streams for a long time for like over a year uh let's see where's our button i don't think we have any styles for a button so we're gonna have to go up here and see what we can do here oh okay so we actually have the the default styles for a button so let's look up in the doc the react native documentation what the styles are for button so if you're doing a react native project i definitely recommend just just leave the react native docs open on your tab uh on on one of your tabs because uh i i reference it so much there's just no point in me even closing it so here's the button you'd see i'm pretty sure we just copied this exactly but what i want to see is uh all the the props uh on press how to assist with color disable test id prefer focus okay so here's our props but what i want to see is what kind of styles we could actually give this um which i don't know let's see let's just add some styles and see if we can give it one we may have to switch it up so you can use touchable opacity or touchable native feedback to give your button some custom styles so we may have to switch up to that that's what i normally end up using anyway but for now let's just see if we can do this so i'm just going to do an inline style just as a test so we're going to add style so in uh react native if you want to do an inline style you can you want to uh use an object right so we're doing style we're putting our curly brackets which means hey we're about to do some javascript and then inside of there we have another set of curly brackets which is just normal javascript right it just says like this is an object and then now we're going to do css as if we were writing so like we're converting our normal css into javascript's object syntax right so we're going to camel case everything uh it's key value pairs right so in this case let's just say height hd if i can spell it ht and we're going to give it something crazy so we just know uh we know that it works right so type 200 so this would be obvious if it works and it didn't right so it looks like we're going to have to change that and we can't actually add a height to a button if there is some way to add height to a button let me know in the chat you know but according to the documentation it didn't look like we could i was hoping there would be like some props but it seems like the only thing you can really change style is this the color okay so i'm just going to click on touchable opacity so it's there and we can we can check that out and if anybody wants to read ahead i'm going to put this in the chat the link to touchable opacity if you've never used it before you can check out the docs basically you're just making something clickable and react native and you can give it whatever styles you want all right and i'm gonna take a fiveminute break here so i'm gonna set my my pomodoro timer to five minutes i'm gonna go to the chat and i'm gonna answer some questions okay so i'm scrolling just seeing a lot of people saying hi at first uh charming muhammad says this is a very good thing thank you oh you're welcome i appreciate that uh akeem says is this a react thing yes yes it's react native web so it's all react native syntax but we're actually running it as a web app if you want to know why we're doing like that watch like the first two streams and i i explain more of the benefits of doing that um eric says how can i find your javascript beginner tutorials so i haven't done a lot of tutorials myself it's mostly live streams and it's some streams are more beginner friendly and some streams aren't just depends on what we're working on that day but um there are some awesome beginner javascript tutorials on this channel on the free codecamp channel if you do want to see my tutorials check out my channel the links in the description i don't do as much with my personal youtube channel i'd love to do more just hard to find the time but i do have some tutorials on there for beginners let's see jalal says smile more bro you look better right all right i'll try to smile more uh the dawn says bro i love this channel oh thanks thanks yeah the free code game channel is awesome like not i'm not just talking about my stream like um there are so many really really good contributors uh and just the variety and quality of content on this channel is i mean it's really amazing and it's impressive like no one's getting paid to do this it's all volunteer uh so it's it's really cool and it's helped a lot of people to get their skills up and get jobs like including me uh charming says pulling in pulling and installing yarn before anything in the morning is good advice been a victim of such trust me you don't want to go through the work before you pull yeah for sure um bell bellis sorry angelo i'm sorry i i probably missed your name up uh let me know how i'm supposed to pronounce it this is uh i can anime that uh i'm not sure where you're what you're for are you offering to animate something and so let me know what you mean because i'm not exactly sure what what you're saying uh yes you asked if i have any plans to work on vue.js projects not right now uh i've i'm like curious about vue but i don't have any immediate plans to work on them maybe maybe i'll do it at some point creative girl says hi which one do i have to learn flexbox css grid or maybe bootstrap i have no idea when you use them okay that's a good question uh there are some answers there uh coding technique says i think flexbox is easier um uh is ishmael says i will go with bootstrap but just know a little flexbox okay so they're not exactly comparable right so bootstrap is an entire css library that's you bring in it's css and javascript and there's a lot of like builtin classes that you can use to style an entire app or a website flexbox is a part of css and so is grid so it's a part of just normal css you don't have to import anything uh extra and it's used for positioning right so back in the day people use tables for positioning or we used floats for positioning but flex or flex box gives you a nicer way to position uh like for instance you can vertically center things on a page very easily with flexbox right that was always really hard to do before and not that it was impossible but it was just more difficult grid is another way to align things on a page so it's not exactly comparable so like if you learned all of bootstrap you could style an entire site if you learned flexbox you could just position things which you couldn't really style things so i say definitely if if you want to do react native then you need to know flexbox uh because flexbox is the default positioning system for react native so i definitely recommend using flexbox that's what we use and like bootstrap's not always going to be available to you so you know try to learn the the regular css it'll be easier to work on a variety of sites if you know css bootstraps should be easy to pick up because it's just basically giving you chunks of you know prewritten css attached to classes that you can add to your site so if you know really no css you'd be able to understand all of bootstrap just by looking at the css files and kind of know what's what's happening and be able to change it up and like customize it to what you need okay does that make sense let me know if it doesn't all right didn't get through everything but let me go back to all right here's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna say i'm gonna mark down here where i left off 746. i need to like adjust the tilt of my screen or something it's really hard to see i need new screens period i just i'm using some old screens that i've just gotten from people like when they're getting rid of their screens okay so let's how much time do we have okay so we have about a half hour left so here's what i'd like to accomplish in that half an hour i want to get the styling so i want to get this button a little bit bigger uh commit these new styles i'm not like obviously we're not finished with the styling but this is just a little bit of some updates um i want to demo cypress for testing and then i want to finish the rest of the questions okay so that's the that's the plan so let's switch this up to use touchable opacity first so we can see in with touchable opacity obviously instead of using body button we're replacing it with this but then also we can put things inside of it and in fact we we need to put things inside of it so let me show you what i mean so right now our button we can say like the title is submit and look there's there's nothing there's no children to this button when we switch it to touchable opacity if we did this nothing would appear on the page right so we need to give it children for instance to to say like hey here's what you should display inside of this button all right so let's switch that up now and go to the top of the file and where we have button let's change it to touchable opacity should have changed up here too yep okay we're going to change it to touchable opacity now i know i'm going to need something in here and i will need text and let's say oh wait is this our oh this was our restart button oh i changed the wrong thing i forgot we had i i totally forgot we had a restart button all right let's do that again let's keep button in there because i don't want to mess with the restart button right now just because i want to finish on time right uh so let's touchable opacity now let's find the right button this time where are we at okay whoa actually did we yeah yeah this is what we did for a second i was like have we been working on the wrong button the whole time but i don't think so all right so touchable opacity and now we're going to say text submit and then we're going to close out touchable opacity okay now let me just say so we'll just see what shows up on the page now before we do anything else so you can see it's it's just the button right so it should still work so like right there's no um and you know what i just thought of we should uh not allow a submit if there's nothing in here i can see that being really frustrating for a child if they accidentally hit submit and haven't even put anything in there and then another enemy comes like that especially if a child is really struggling with their math and it would like almost be beat it and they know what the answer is and they just accidentally hit submit like that could be devastating for a little kid right like so let's make that happen so that we check to make sure that basically if there is nothing in this box we don't allow submit all right we're not going to do that right now but um let's just keep that in mind and add that in at some point if somebody wants to make an issue for that feel free to make an issue i'll try to remember and make an issue for it later uh okay so we need to style this this submit button right so you can see like our color you know that's not that's not going to work right we do someone to keep this test id i believe the title is not going to matter here we can double check that there is no title attribute let's see if it shows us yeah so our props here style active opacity yeah okay hmm actually this is kind of weird why do we have it's weird that they don't list on press under this i guess maybe they're just like assuming that you would have that but anyway we can remove where are we at oops here's our code you can definitely remove the color uh let's give this a style though style equals and let's say styles dot we'll just call this button for now i know we're gonna have we have more than one button but we'll just say styles.button and i'm going to group this i'm going to put this under input since it appears under the input all right so we need to give this like a height a width a background color right so let's say our height is going to be 40 pixels so we always want to at least go 40 for touches you know let's go um let's at least bump it up to 50 right i want to make this bigger than you would normally make it for an adult uh like i said i know kids fingers are smaller but they may be a bit more clumsy okay button height uh with let's just go with with like 100 for now let's see how it looks and then background color we can give it that same color that we had i'm not like a huge fan of that color but i don't really have any other color in mind so we might as well just use it okay let's see what that gives us now hey look we've got got a button okay you could see like look it's still just totally bare bones the the submit is not even centered so let's work on this submit as well yeah okay uh so we can actually set this to display i don't know if i should i don't think i need to put display flex on here but let's see so let's say justify content center and align items oops center so this is flexbox so this is what i'm talking about when i say flexbox makes vertically aligning things easy so this is going to vertically and horizontally center submit hopefully let's see yep here we go so now it was up here now it is both vertically and horizontally centered so easy especially if you remember everything that you had to go through to make this happen before flexbox so much easier all right now we want to make our our text a little bit more readable so we're definitely going to give it a color of let's just say white for now all right so fff is going to give us white uh that's the the hex code and let's make the font size so the button itself is what's 50 so let's make our font size 40. i definitely don't want it to be bigger and let's see what it looks like oops we didn't apply it to the text so on the text here let's say style equals styles dot button text whoa okay we need to make that wider and okay yeah definitely need to make it wider and probably taller all right so the button now is 100 uh let's double it to 200 and let's make its height 60. okay that's more reasonable it's still not like a spectacular looking button but it does have a little effect right it has this little kind of flash thing right um and it still works all right i tell you truth like i i'm not thrilled with the way this button turned out but but it allows us to customize it so we can further customize this as we we need to right uh let's see yeah that i'm kind of thinking that the submit button is like dominating the page now i mean i do want to keep track of my time okay but uh i think i'm at a point now where i want to commit this uh and and then check out the testing suite so that i have enough time to get to the um like the the messages uh the chat messages okay so so if if you're totally a beginner and you're not really familiar with version control uh we're using get okay so we have a git status and that tells us what's changed right we've only really worked on one file right so that's to be expected and now we're gonna do a git commit i'm going to give it an am flag okay and then i'm going to put the commit message so i'm going to say feature um this is like a terrible message uh but we we just adjusted styles right so let's commit that and now we can do a get push right and that's gonna push that up to github right okay so that's like very very basic of using get you commit and then you push um now we basically have a save point for our code that we could always go back to that point later on so if we totally mess things up in the next stream it's okay because we could always go back to this point all right now let's check out our package json for a second and see that we have this e2e script all right and that's going to open up cyprus and run some tests okay so let's let's check this out so we're going to run yarn e to e and like i haven't really used cyprus yet so harshit set this up um i think it's really cool i did run it once just to see what it did uh but it's definitely something that i want to learn more about uh because it's pretty cool so while this is doing its thing which why is this taking there we go so you see this is definitely different than what we had in the test before before our tests would just run and you know display some things here in the console but this is bringing up this whole ui right so it says here's our test here's our file right oops this is the following place cool all right so i click that and now it's running i didn't mean to actually run them but so i clicked on that file and you can see it's run all the tests in that file so we only have one file with the test i'm assuming if we had more it would show all the tests and we could run them all at once if we wanted okay but if you saw some flashes up on the screen of basically it it was running this and and going through the motions of clicking everything and it says we can see a title we can see hero and we can we get the if we do a correct addition answer it reduces the enemies by one right so we don't have a lot of tests in there but it's kind of cool to have a ui as well i know some of the people i work with on my team are way more familiar with ui stuff as opposed to like doing things through the command line uh so it definitely could be helpful um to be able to have that that visual uh of this so i can see you've no recorded run yeah so there's a lot of stuff in here that i haven't even messed with wow okay so there's all your settings in here so i mean this is really cool so definitely check this out if you need to do react testing wow really cool all right uh so i'm not gonna go more into that yet because i myself don't know that much about it so i'd rather not mislead you but i promised harshit that i would demo it so definitely uh you know check that out it looks cool it does give us some output in the command line as well um all right let's let's go back to the chat so i've left about 15 minutes before i have to end the show for chat so i hope i can get through everything uh before i have to end it and where'd i do that okay so i ended about there in the chat about 6 46 my time there we go okay and i'm gonna i didn't really display what's changed in our package json so i'm just going to put that up here uh really the dev dispen dependencies change we have cypress and our eslint plugin for cypress and all the stuff with like mocha and chai and puppeteer are gone all right so let's get to these questions uh ab abdullahi says i am fresh to programming and i don't know where to start uh check out freecodecam.org and just start out with with some of the lessons there it's totally free uh just create a free account and like free code camp's never going to try to sell you anything we're not going to spam you with ads nothing like that so just check it out start doing some of the the um the lessons there and see how you like it um web noob says in response to creative girl's question about flexbox and bootstrap and grid says everything is important to learn it yeah i mean ultimately yeah it's great to know everything but i would say like don't don't get overwhelmed thinking that you have to learn everything you definitely don't you know if you just pick something and learn it you're fine right so um i would just try not to be anxious about what to learn what to learn first and in what order uh you know just just learning something and being able to work with it is great like a ton of websites use bootstrap if you just know bootstrap there's a ton of work out there um the same way like if you just know flexbox you don't know bootstrap or grid you can still do a lot of awesome things like so basically my point is like as long as you're learning something that's you're good you know you're already going in the right direction you know and you'll learn more eventually just you know it takes time jimmy says guys please can you help me out how can i animate a button on long press um i'm not exactly sure that would be something i'd have to look up myself so i can't give you an answer right now but maybe somebody else in the in the chat can web noob says uh hey jesse are you teaching your kids and programming can't wait to try with my son yeah so actually i i do so we have like some little kid programming books uh that we we read to the kids sometimes and um we have trying to make what it's called uh tinker so we have a tinker subscription uh so i think it's like tinker.com or something and they have coding exercises for kids and so our my kids do that so we've tried out some other ones too um but my son especially my oldest my nineyearold seems to really like the tinker stuff and he works on it all the time so yeah so we're we're trying to teach him and not like pushing them into that into it but you know just kind of providing them with books and uh you know like lessons and stuff so it's there if they want to want it you know and they're just excited about using a computer so if i tell them like well the only way you can use computers if you're doing the coding stuff then usually that's enough and and they do it uh let's say uh bob i'm i'm really sorry i'm not pronouncing your name right uh but says are you using the windows subsystem for linux uh no so i am using bash on windows but i'm not i haven't done anything with the the subsystem yet it's uh gaming says hello everyone hey how's it going let's see oh cool so michael creel uh answered my question about the button and unfortunately i didn't look over to see that but thanks michael it basically says from stack overflow this component has limited options so you can't resize it to a fixed height all right so uh so that is true so basically we we did have to switch the button over to a touchable opacity in order to basically change anything except the color and text um for fargentius says uh are you doing the mobile or web yeah so right now we're doing web but we're gonna switch it over to mobile so let me give you an update on that actually so i'd like to use expo to help us uh test and build the mobile versions but unfortunately so all right let me give some background to explain this so like expo just takes has its own fork of react native right uh and it allows you to create react native apps more easily it comes with a lot of builtin things to to like developer tools and like different components that work with like hardware on a phone on a device so i'd love to use expo because it comes with all that but since expo has its own fork of react native it's behind a little bit so it's not the latest version so the latest version of react native allows you to use react hooks which we are using right but the expo version of react native doesn't yet support hooks so if we try to use expo right now we would have to switch to not use hooks and that would be a lot of refactoring and i don't want to refactor it back to that i'd rather use hooks so the plan is this i'm going to keep developing the web version i'm going to keep the mobile styles in mind like by using dev tools and mimicking the phone right but we're not actually going to test it on a device we're going to wait for the next update to expo which should allow us to use hooks then we'll pull in expo into our project and we'll be able to run the web version the mobile version the mobile in a simulator side by side so that we make a change we can immediately see how it impacts both the web and mobile versions so hopefully that makes sense we could just use straight up react native and run it like that but like i i really do like everything the additional stuff that expo uses so i'd rather just wait on that if it seems like it's gonna take a really long time then maybe we'll rethink that strategy but that's where i'm at right now so the mobile's coming we're just kind of waiting on the next expo update if anybody had knows like if you've been keeping track of the updates to expo and you have some insight into when that's gonna happen let me know last week or something i did read up on it and at least at that point i don't think there was an exact time for the next release saeed says love you bro oh thanks i love you too um let's see vedant says this channel is great um manu says well thanks thanks i appreciate that man who says please suggest um all right let me hold on let me read this question says i'm i'm intermediate in javascript but i can't build up logics what should i do um i check out some of the more advanced javascript uh problems in free code camp so freecodecam.org i check those out i know i keep recommending free code camp but it's just quality stuff and it's totally free right if you feel like you need more then maybe you know go look at some of the paid things out there but free code camp's always a great place to start there's always links to additional resources on the free code camp lessons so you can go and read more if if you want to but i would say yeah check those out it's gonna you know give you some algorithm problems uh and practice is really i mean that's how you build up your skills so just keep at it um it'll it'll be tough it's it's tough for me um to do the algorithm stuff and kind of the more advanced um like logic based stuff right because as a primarily like web mobile developer you know you're not doing a lot of algorithm based stuff so you don't normally get practice you kind of have to go out of your way to keep up and practice that stuff um jm says have you ever told your youtube audience about how you got into coding your challenges obstacles how you got your first job etc um it would be of interest to us newbies so i have a little so check out my youtube channel the link in this is in the description i have done some videos on like my background and how i got into that so go ahead and check that out um if you check that out and like there's something more specific you want me to talk about let me know and maybe i can make a video about that as well but yeah that's a good question and so i do have kind of a basic overview of how i got into coding um so that should kind of highlight a lot of that oh goodness um somebody said in response to the question about building up skills and logic and stuff uh somebody gave the response of just give up if you can't build logic then coding is not really your thing um so number one i would say please don't do comments like that you know we're trying to help each other out uh so i i don't really want comments like that let's keep it positive secondly like i'm gonna say it again like practice is the difference between people that can do things and people they can't right there's not like you know some people do have more natural ability one way or another or maybe their background gives them more ability but it's still if you practice you can get there so uh if something is really hard that doesn't mean you should give up it doesn't mean you can't do it right it just means you need more practice right that's that's it so yeah don't don't give up uh if this is what you want to do then keep at it right um and uh just don't get discouraged i you know it's easy to say don't get discouraged but just realize that like everyone goes through times where they feel like they just can't figure things out like i was working on a bug on my work project and trying to get something to work for like over a week just trying and trying and everything i tried just didn't work and i just felt like i was never going to figure this out and then then i did and it works it was and it was awesome and my team was excited and my boss took me to his boss and said here demo this thing right it was awesome all right and and but i really thought you know just just like two days before i was like in despair of ever finding a solution right so it's just like you know keep going and you find a solution right i think people that have been doing this for a long time realize that you will always find a solution eventually so you know don't give up so um but just in general everybody try to keep things positive here you know there's enough depressing stuff out there in the world i don't want this stream to add to that okay um icram says anyone know any materials about music recommendation systems which could be helpful to my college project uh i'm really sorry um i don't know anything about that so i won't be able to help you hopefully somebody in the chat can um okay all right so jay says i'm confused between android and react what can i start for job purpose um okay so react is used normally for web apps right react native can be used for android apps so you could start out by just learning react and then transition into react native to build things for android as well so it kind of depends on what you want to do if you know you just want to be an android developer then maybe you you just learn android development and just don't worry about react at all but react is going to allow you to develop things for more devices more platforms so that may be a better path for a job but like it just kind of depends really on what you want to do aman asks can you use react navigation with react native web um so yeah so the navigation is a little bit tricky uh so you can use any navigation that will work on the web with react native web but when you want to also do it on mobile you'd have to have an alternate navigation system that would work with mobile so um i'm actually i'm working with navigation systems on another project right now that's react native web and so right now for the web navigation we're using uh react router but for mobile it's really like we have no mobile navigation system set up we're just kind of using state to navigate so like it's if that is a little bit tricky um i don't know of a navigation system that would work for both as of right now i'm hopeful there is one because i'd like to use it uh but to be honest i need to do more research on it as well all right i mean listen i do want to say like so i can see the the conversation from earlier that kind of got took a wrong turn there is going on so everybody just kind of like chill so um they don't like uh you like you're cool just like kind of like please don't tell people to give up um and then everybody else that's getting on vadon like let's just be cool about it too right like um and let's kind of just let it go for now all right okay michael creel says uh regarding coding with your kids have you tried scratch yes we have done some stuff with scratch that's really cool uh so if you haven't done anything with scratch even if you're an adult coder like check it out it's actually pretty fun um it's kind of like a drag and drop coding interface it's it's cool michael says if you have an android device you can plug it put it in a debug mode connect it to your computer and then dev tools can let you interact live with your phone um yeah that's yeah we have done that i've done that before um so yeah we may end up doing that but i do i want to do something in a way that uh everybody can see it on the stream so i don't want to run stuff on my device let's see oh cool so oman is researching navigation system that works on both okay cool i'll uh if you find anything let me know i i definitely want to want to know more about that um oh okay michael cruz is saying that it shows up live in devtools so maybe that might be something we could do where i could test it on my android uh it would show up live in devtools so you all could see it as well okay so maybe we'll have to to do that um robert boy uh best language to learn for beginners um it depends on what you want really um which you really want to learn but assuming you have no preference for what you want to try to do i'm going to say javascript because you can run javascript in a browser um and you don't need anything special on your uh on your computer right so uh try that out like if you if you know you want to do something different like if you're not interested in web development at all then like don't mess around with javascript right um but if you think you might want to do something that has to do with web development then go with javascript because you're going to have to learn it at some point anyway if you want to do web dev all right uh okay so i went over a little bit uh but i did get all the questions in so anyway uh i guess we'll be we'll wrap things up now i feel like i'm forgetting something but i think we did everything all right so thank you all so much for watching i'm not gonna be able to stream on friday because i'm gonna be at a conference so i'll be at the star trek conference in columbus ohio here in the in the u.s so i believe my talk from that conference is going to be online so whenever it gets posted online i'll i'll mention it in the chat and i'll probably post it on my social media and stuff so if you liked what you saw here subscribe and check out my channel and my social media and stuff links are in the description if you have suggestions for what i could do in the future you know let me know if you want to contribute to this project feel free you can add issues you can submit pull requests like the project's totally open source if you have any other questions that i didn't get to today you didn't get a chance to ask you know put it in the comments um send it to me on social media you know i'm happy to happy to help so uh i guess i'll see you all next week until then have a great week and uh thanks again for watching
