00:02 - [Music]
00:04 - what's going on guys my name is jay
00:06 - and in this video i'm going to show you
00:08 - how i use gulp
00:10 - almost every day if you don't know what
00:13 - gulp is i want to show you very quickly
00:15 - um what one of the things that you can
00:18 - do with it so right now i have here a
00:20 - very basic website you can see that i'm
00:22 - requesting a
00:24 - style.css file
00:26 - now i don't have this file yet because
00:29 - i'm using sas as you can see here
00:32 - so this is all some sas code so
00:35 - i need to compile this code to or see so
00:38 - a css file only one css file
00:42 - but then after that i want to minify
00:46 - that css file and then
00:48 - use the css file it sounds very
00:51 - complicated but
00:53 - that's when gulps come and help us so
00:55 - gulp can actually every time i edit
00:59 - something here and i save the file
01:02 - gulp can do all that for me
01:05 - automatically you can pause the file it
01:07 - save the file in a folder you get the
01:09 - file from that folder and save it or
01:11 - another folder
01:12 - and and convert the file whatever you
01:15 - want
01:15 - gulp can do it let's go and install gulp
01:19 - and for that you're going to need node
01:22 - js every link that i'm going to show
01:24 - here every website that i'm going to
01:25 - show you i'm going to paste it on the
01:26 - description of this video go there
01:28 - download it install it in your computer
01:30 - it's just like a normal app so install
01:32 - it there and then after it's installed
01:35 - then we go here to gulpjs.com
01:39 - and we can install gulp we're gonna use
01:42 - our command command line
01:44 - interface which a ton of people is
01:46 - scared of this interface right now to
01:49 - install gulp we just need to follow
01:51 - these simple instructions here we can
01:54 - just copy and paste it all right
01:56 - remember you need to install node.js
01:58 - before if not if this is not going to
02:00 - work
02:01 - all right so
02:02 - let's open the command line for now you
02:05 - can be on any folder
02:07 - but then we need to go to our project
02:10 - folder okay so first you need to install
02:12 - the gulp cli because we're going to use
02:14 - some
02:15 - specific commands for gulp so you just
02:18 - need to copy this
02:21 - and paste it here
02:24 - and hit enter and it will install
02:27 - everything you need to use the gulp
02:30 - command line and everything
02:32 - if you're using mac and you get like
02:34 - permission errors all you need to do is
02:37 - like use um sudo
02:39 - sudo and then paste that and hit enter
02:43 - okay
02:44 - i'm not gonna do it because i already
02:45 - did it and i'm just gonna load and
02:47 - i already have all everything i need all
02:50 - right so next thing i'm gonna do um now
02:53 - i'm gonna go to the folder so let's look
02:55 - at my project folder is this one right
02:58 - here
02:59 - so i'm just gonna i'm just gonna write
03:01 - cd
03:02 - space and i'm just gonna drag and drop
03:04 - the folder i'm gonna hit enter
03:08 - and right now i'm inside my project
03:11 - folder
03:12 - right you can double check by writing ls
03:15 - hit enter it will show you the files
03:18 - inside that folder and that's correct
03:21 - um you can just you can use pwd and it
03:24 - will show you
03:25 - the path to that folder and this is
03:27 - correct so we're good to go i'm gonna
03:30 - put clear
03:31 - so we can clear that out
03:33 - we are in our folder good
03:37 - and now we can just
03:39 - run this command call npm
03:43 - init
03:44 - and this will create like a file
03:47 - um with
03:49 - a bunch of things that is gonna describe
03:51 - our project so for example our package
03:54 - name you can put whatever you want i'm
03:56 - just gonna hit enter
03:58 - the version i'm just going to hit enter
03:59 - again description whatever you want i
04:02 - don't want to put anything for now
04:04 - um entry point so i'm just hitting enter
04:07 - enter enter
04:09 - until the end it will show you like a
04:11 - preview
04:12 - um so right now everything is empty here
04:15 - it doesn't matter for now it's gonna
04:16 - work
04:17 - but i think you wanna add a little bit
04:19 - of description and your name and all
04:21 - that stuff so i'm gonna
04:24 - yes
04:25 - all right so
04:27 - if we go inside our folder now we have
04:29 - this new of file
04:32 - so i'm going to open my editor
04:36 - you will see it here and that's what we
04:38 - did right now that's um you know like
04:39 - the name the version description
04:42 - all right next we're gonna copy this
04:46 - this is what is going to install gulp in
04:48 - our project so let's go there
04:52 - let's clear this out
04:55 - let's paste it
04:57 - let's hit enter
04:59 - this is going to take a minute or two
05:00 - depending on your computer
05:02 - all right and that's done
05:04 - um it's going to give you some warnings
05:06 - because of is going they're going to
05:08 - tell you to update this package or
05:10 - whatever don't worry that's not gonna be
05:13 - uh an issue
05:15 - so you will see that we have gulp and
05:17 - they're gonna let you know the version
05:21 - um all the packages they added and all
05:22 - that stuff so right now we have gulp
05:26 - inside our
05:28 - folder here
05:30 - and now you will notice something
05:32 - different in your
05:34 - file your package.json file that you
05:37 - created earlier and you'll see depth
05:39 - dependencies
05:40 - gulp and the version so for now we're
05:43 - just going to close that so don't worry
05:44 - about that file
05:46 - let's go back to the gold website and
05:48 - now we're going to do this one this is
05:51 - copy
05:53 - let's go back there
05:55 - let's clear this out
05:57 - and now we're going to paste that
05:59 - so touch is just a command that will
06:02 - create a file so it's going to create a
06:05 - gulp file.js and it's going to be empty
06:07 - it's just creating that file we're going
06:09 - to hit enter
06:11 - and that's it let's see
06:14 - and now we have this
06:16 - gobfile.js file and it's totally empty
06:20 - okay
06:22 - let's go back and this gulp help you
06:24 - don't have to it's just this is just
06:26 - more for um
06:28 - instruction and then explaining you
06:29 - different commands that you can use to
06:31 - help
06:32 - um if you're confused or whatever
06:34 - but that's it
06:36 - so we are ready to start
06:40 - our project
06:42 - so we are here um open your gulp file um
06:46 - dot js this is a very important file
06:48 - this is the file that we're gonna use
06:50 - and
06:51 - add some code here okay
06:53 - the first one we're gonna create a
06:55 - variable of gold
06:57 - equals require
07:03 - and
07:04 - gold
07:07 - whoops
07:08 - that's the first one and you need it
07:11 - it's very important
07:12 - um you needed to run gulp of course um
07:15 - we're getting gulp and now we're gonna
07:17 - do is
07:19 - adding different packages so the first
07:21 - one i need is
07:23 - the sas one
07:25 - which is going to get all my sass files
07:28 - and put it on a different folder
07:31 - compile everything and put a css file on
07:34 - it
07:35 - all right
07:36 - so i have here
07:38 - the packet somewhere here i think this
07:41 - one
07:42 - here you go
07:44 - so in here you can search for a ton of
07:46 - packages.coms that you can install using
07:49 - npm
07:51 - ton of packages thousands of packages
07:53 - that you different you can use you can
07:55 - get very very creative so this is the
07:57 - one that actually
07:58 - get my sass file and compile to css
08:01 - so here is very simple they give you
08:03 - this so you can install so let's just
08:05 - copy
08:07 - let's go there
08:09 - let's paste it
08:11 - let's hit enter
08:14 - alright so now we have the gulp assass
08:19 - already installed so we can use it
08:21 - so let's go back there
08:24 - to our um editor
08:27 - all right so now we need to add here
08:31 - so you can see
08:32 - they give you like an example of how you
08:34 - can add
08:35 - your um
08:37 - how you can use that package so let's
08:39 - just copy and paste it
08:41 - first we need to um
08:43 - add the package and require the package
08:45 - so let's just copy this
08:48 - and this
08:51 - let's go back there
08:56 - all right cool
08:58 - now this
09:00 - this is a task this is what's gonna run
09:03 - like a function that is gonna run
09:05 - let's just see what's going on here it's
09:06 - gonna take the sass which is this so
09:09 - this one here
09:11 - we need to change it because we have
09:14 - our sas in this sas folder so let's go
09:16 - here
09:19 - sas
09:21 - and then inside this sas folder we're
09:24 - going to have a bunch of sas files so
09:26 - we're going to do
09:28 - this
09:30 - dot set so
09:32 - this is like a wild card it's going to
09:34 - take every single file that we have with
09:37 - this
09:38 - format
09:41 - so it's gonna take every single one or
09:43 - you can you can be very specific you can
09:45 - be like style.sas it's gonna take that
09:47 - but for now i'm just gonna i want every
09:50 - single file so you do that and that's
09:52 - done
09:53 - so it's gonna happen here this is just
09:55 - if there's an error they're gonna tell
09:57 - you they're gonna tell you there's an
09:58 - error
09:59 - if not
10:00 - it's gonna pipe and then it's gonna
10:03 - run whatever you want and save
10:05 - your css file here
10:08 - so all this
10:10 - i don't want to confuse you all this is
10:12 - just getting the file your sas file
10:14 - compiling the file and saving the css
10:16 - file in this folder
10:19 - so right now it's saving the file on a
10:20 - css folder which we don't have it
10:22 - doesn't exist but gulp is going to
10:24 - create the folder for us so you don't
10:26 - have to okay
10:29 - so let's save that
10:31 - and let's test it so
10:33 - our task name is sas
10:37 - so let's go
10:38 - and say gulp
10:41 - says
10:43 - hit enter
10:49 - all right
10:51 - you can see here no errors no nothing
10:53 - it's just saying lo you know started the
10:54 - sas task it's finished after this time
10:57 - we're good to go
10:59 - if you go back now to your editor you
11:01 - will see a new css folder
11:04 - let's open that folder there is a
11:06 - style.css which is the same name as this
11:08 - one
11:10 - and look at this
11:12 - normal css very cool huh
11:15 - gulp is helping us to do that for us now
11:19 - i need to create another task
11:22 - for the css because i want to then get
11:25 - all the css and minify
11:28 - the css so let's go back there
11:34 - we need
11:35 - the uglified css package
11:38 - so same thing
11:40 - they have here the install
11:43 - command line so let's copy
11:46 - let's clear all this
11:49 - all right so let's paste it
11:51 - and hit enter
11:53 - alright cool
11:54 - same thing now we have the uglify css
11:58 - installed and ready to use so let's go
12:00 - here and now we can actually use it
12:04 - just copy
12:11 - let's
12:13 - paste it here
12:16 - all right so as you can see it's kind of
12:18 - doing the same thing all over again when
12:20 - you have a new package
12:22 - i'm just gonna
12:24 - put this one
12:26 - down here
12:28 - just because i want it you don't have to
12:30 - do it like that but
12:32 - all right so right now
12:33 - is um the task is called css
12:37 - and it's gonna take the file from this
12:39 - so let's change it
12:40 - it's gonna be inside our css folder and
12:44 - i'm gonna do the same thing
12:46 - every file with a css format
12:49 - is gonna um is gonna take it and
12:53 - uglify it which is
12:55 - another word for minified
12:59 - and we have some options here that i'm
13:01 - gonna explain to you what they do so for
13:04 - example max line length is like
13:07 - every um 80 characters i want a new line
13:11 - which i don't want to but i'm going to
13:13 - leave it like that so we can see how it
13:15 - looks
13:16 - and it's going to save it on a folder
13:18 - named dist
13:20 - i'm going to leave it like that this can
13:21 - be whatever you want really
13:24 - i'm going to leave it like that i'm
13:25 - going to save this
13:29 - and let's
13:30 - run this task let's do it
13:33 - let's do gulp
13:35 - css
13:36 - hit enter
13:39 - all right cool
13:40 - everything seems to work
13:43 - and now you'll notice that we have a new
13:45 - dist folder let's open that we have a
13:48 - style.css here
13:51 - and there you can now you now we can see
13:53 - that is and minified
13:55 - css file this is a good file that we can
13:58 - use on our production like
14:00 - this is what you're gonna you're gonna
14:02 - upload to your server
14:04 - it's gonna be very fast
14:06 - but this is what i don't like about the
14:08 - max
14:09 - length
14:10 - option thing
14:12 - is creating new lines
14:14 - for us
14:16 - so i'm just gonna remove that
14:20 - save it again
14:23 - i'm gonna run gulp
14:27 - css let's see if it change
14:30 - this is what i'm looking for so now we
14:32 - have only one line of code with all the
14:35 - css
14:36 - in that line of code and this is perfect
14:38 - this is what i like and now this is what
14:40 - i'm using on my website as you can see
14:44 - is getting from the dist folder
14:47 - style css
14:48 - and that's what i'm using
14:50 - [Music]
14:52 - so let's see if this is working right
14:53 - now
14:55 - all right
14:57 - so it's reading the css just fine
14:59 - everything looks
15:00 - looks great
15:02 - so
15:04 - let's close this
15:06 - and this we don't need it now
15:12 - all right but the thing is that now
15:14 - you need to go there and kind of use
15:17 - gold sass or gold css every time you
15:21 - want to do it and that's not
15:24 - what i want right you want everything to
15:26 - be automatically
15:28 - my goal is
15:29 - every time i change something
15:31 - in my sas file
15:34 - and hit save
15:36 - everything will change automatically i
15:38 - don't have to go here and type
15:41 - the task
15:44 - so let's go to
15:45 - gulpfile.js
15:47 - and let's add some stuff so
15:51 - i'm going to get a new task gulp dot
15:55 - task
15:59 - and this is gonna be called whatever i
16:02 - want but i'm gonna call it run
16:05 - and it's gonna run my sas task
16:09 - and my
16:11 - css task
16:14 - right
16:15 - that's cool
16:16 - but now
16:18 - i wanna go
16:19 - a little bit further
16:21 - so i'm gonna write another task
16:28 - and this one is gonna be called
16:30 - watch
16:34 - and we're going to run a function for
16:36 - this one
16:42 - all right and this is the one that i
16:44 - like this is the one that is going to do
16:46 - everything for you automatically without
16:49 - touching the command line okay
16:52 - so we're going to do gulp
16:54 - watch
16:58 - and the files that we want to watch
17:00 - every time every every time i change my
17:02 - sas file so let's go and
17:06 - sass
17:09 - if i change any file
17:12 - with the sas
17:16 - is gonna run my sass
17:21 - sorry
17:22 - like this
17:22 - [Music]
17:24 - okay
17:25 - same thing with css so
17:28 - if my css changes i want to go
17:33 - so let's go to the folder
17:38 - oops
17:39 - css
17:42 - same thing every single css that i have
17:44 - there
17:47 - [Music]
17:48 - is gonna run my css task
17:55 - all right so that's watch now i'm gonna
17:57 - create a task
18:02 - and it's going to be the default task so
18:05 - let's go there
18:09 - default
18:14 - now i'm gonna do i'm gonna run my run
18:18 - task
18:21 - and
18:23 - my
18:24 - watch
18:24 - task
18:30 - so when i say um default is
18:33 - gulp
18:35 - so if i
18:37 - if i write gulp
18:40 - is gonna give you an error right now
18:42 - because we don't have it yet
18:46 - but
18:47 - we created so let's save this file
18:52 - and now let's see if it works so let's
18:54 - go gulp
18:57 - oops sorry sorry sorry sorry we need a
19:00 - coma
19:00 - after the task name coma
19:04 - save it again
19:06 - let's clear this
19:10 - gulp
19:12 - and there you go so everything runs
19:15 - and now
19:16 - it's kind of a
19:18 - washing or file so gulp is kind of
19:21 - um
19:23 - watching you and if you make a change
19:26 - it will go again and run everything
19:27 - again
19:29 - all right if you want to get out of here
19:31 - of this watching state you just need to
19:34 - um
19:35 - hit ctrl c and you will see that we go
19:39 - like back to normal
19:41 - all right but that's not what what i
19:42 - want so gold
19:45 - alright cool
19:47 - so let's go to the sas
19:51 - all right make sure you're watching this
19:53 - because i want to know if it changed so
19:55 - make sure you're watching this
19:57 - let's go to the sas file let's change
20:00 - i don't know the font size for example
20:02 - let's save it
20:04 - all right let's reload the page
20:08 - and it's changing
20:10 - so
20:12 - every time i save my sash file
20:15 - is compiling my file is doing all this
20:19 - compiling my file to css is getting my
20:22 - css and minifying my css
20:26 - and then it's washing our files every
20:28 - time
20:29 - we do this so it's kind of
20:33 - an automated
20:34 - workflow
20:36 - and this is only the basics okay this is
20:38 - very simple right now this can be very
20:40 - very complicated
20:42 - you can save your file it can do a ton
20:45 - of things you can do everything with
20:47 - javascript for example this is only css
20:50 - we can
20:51 - um we can run prefixes we can do
20:53 - javascript minify too we can do babel
20:57 - so you can um you can do a ton of things
21:00 - with gulp this is only
21:03 - the basics with with a sass file compile
21:06 - and stuff like that
21:08 - so i hope you like this that's it

Cleaned transcript:

what's going on guys my name is jay and in this video i'm going to show you how i use gulp almost every day if you don't know what gulp is i want to show you very quickly um what one of the things that you can do with it so right now i have here a very basic website you can see that i'm requesting a style.css file now i don't have this file yet because i'm using sas as you can see here so this is all some sas code so i need to compile this code to or see so a css file only one css file but then after that i want to minify that css file and then use the css file it sounds very complicated but that's when gulps come and help us so gulp can actually every time i edit something here and i save the file gulp can do all that for me automatically you can pause the file it save the file in a folder you get the file from that folder and save it or another folder and and convert the file whatever you want gulp can do it let's go and install gulp and for that you're going to need node js every link that i'm going to show here every website that i'm going to show you i'm going to paste it on the description of this video go there download it install it in your computer it's just like a normal app so install it there and then after it's installed then we go here to gulpjs.com and we can install gulp we're gonna use our command command line interface which a ton of people is scared of this interface right now to install gulp we just need to follow these simple instructions here we can just copy and paste it all right remember you need to install node.js before if not if this is not going to work all right so let's open the command line for now you can be on any folder but then we need to go to our project folder okay so first you need to install the gulp cli because we're going to use some specific commands for gulp so you just need to copy this and paste it here and hit enter and it will install everything you need to use the gulp command line and everything if you're using mac and you get like permission errors all you need to do is like use um sudo sudo and then paste that and hit enter okay i'm not gonna do it because i already did it and i'm just gonna load and i already have all everything i need all right so next thing i'm gonna do um now i'm gonna go to the folder so let's look at my project folder is this one right here so i'm just gonna i'm just gonna write cd space and i'm just gonna drag and drop the folder i'm gonna hit enter and right now i'm inside my project folder right you can double check by writing ls hit enter it will show you the files inside that folder and that's correct um you can just you can use pwd and it will show you the path to that folder and this is correct so we're good to go i'm gonna put clear so we can clear that out we are in our folder good and now we can just run this command call npm init and this will create like a file um with a bunch of things that is gonna describe our project so for example our package name you can put whatever you want i'm just gonna hit enter the version i'm just going to hit enter again description whatever you want i don't want to put anything for now um entry point so i'm just hitting enter enter enter until the end it will show you like a preview um so right now everything is empty here it doesn't matter for now it's gonna work but i think you wanna add a little bit of description and your name and all that stuff so i'm gonna yes all right so if we go inside our folder now we have this new of file so i'm going to open my editor you will see it here and that's what we did right now that's um you know like the name the version description all right next we're gonna copy this this is what is going to install gulp in our project so let's go there let's clear this out let's paste it let's hit enter this is going to take a minute or two depending on your computer all right and that's done um it's going to give you some warnings because of is going they're going to tell you to update this package or whatever don't worry that's not gonna be uh an issue so you will see that we have gulp and they're gonna let you know the version um all the packages they added and all that stuff so right now we have gulp inside our folder here and now you will notice something different in your file your package.json file that you created earlier and you'll see depth dependencies gulp and the version so for now we're just going to close that so don't worry about that file let's go back to the gold website and now we're going to do this one this is copy let's go back there let's clear this out and now we're going to paste that so touch is just a command that will create a file so it's going to create a gulp file.js and it's going to be empty it's just creating that file we're going to hit enter and that's it let's see and now we have this gobfile.js file and it's totally empty okay let's go back and this gulp help you don't have to it's just this is just more for um instruction and then explaining you different commands that you can use to help um if you're confused or whatever but that's it so we are ready to start our project so we are here um open your gulp file um dot js this is a very important file this is the file that we're gonna use and add some code here okay the first one we're gonna create a variable of gold equals require and gold whoops that's the first one and you need it it's very important um you needed to run gulp of course um we're getting gulp and now we're gonna do is adding different packages so the first one i need is the sas one which is going to get all my sass files and put it on a different folder compile everything and put a css file on it all right so i have here the packet somewhere here i think this one here you go so in here you can search for a ton of packages.coms that you can install using npm ton of packages thousands of packages that you different you can use you can get very very creative so this is the one that actually get my sass file and compile to css so here is very simple they give you this so you can install so let's just copy let's go there let's paste it let's hit enter alright so now we have the gulp assass already installed so we can use it so let's go back there to our um editor all right so now we need to add here so you can see they give you like an example of how you can add your um how you can use that package so let's just copy and paste it first we need to um add the package and require the package so let's just copy this and this let's go back there all right cool now this this is a task this is what's gonna run like a function that is gonna run let's just see what's going on here it's gonna take the sass which is this so this one here we need to change it because we have our sas in this sas folder so let's go here sas and then inside this sas folder we're going to have a bunch of sas files so we're going to do this dot set so this is like a wild card it's going to take every single file that we have with this format so it's gonna take every single one or you can you can be very specific you can be like style.sas it's gonna take that but for now i'm just gonna i want every single file so you do that and that's done so it's gonna happen here this is just if there's an error they're gonna tell you they're gonna tell you there's an error if not it's gonna pipe and then it's gonna run whatever you want and save your css file here so all this i don't want to confuse you all this is just getting the file your sas file compiling the file and saving the css file in this folder so right now it's saving the file on a css folder which we don't have it doesn't exist but gulp is going to create the folder for us so you don't have to okay so let's save that and let's test it so our task name is sas so let's go and say gulp says hit enter all right you can see here no errors no nothing it's just saying lo you know started the sas task it's finished after this time we're good to go if you go back now to your editor you will see a new css folder let's open that folder there is a style.css which is the same name as this one and look at this normal css very cool huh gulp is helping us to do that for us now i need to create another task for the css because i want to then get all the css and minify the css so let's go back there we need the uglified css package so same thing they have here the install command line so let's copy let's clear all this all right so let's paste it and hit enter alright cool same thing now we have the uglify css installed and ready to use so let's go here and now we can actually use it just copy let's paste it here all right so as you can see it's kind of doing the same thing all over again when you have a new package i'm just gonna put this one down here just because i want it you don't have to do it like that but all right so right now is um the task is called css and it's gonna take the file from this so let's change it it's gonna be inside our css folder and i'm gonna do the same thing every file with a css format is gonna um is gonna take it and uglify it which is another word for minified and we have some options here that i'm gonna explain to you what they do so for example max line length is like every um 80 characters i want a new line which i don't want to but i'm going to leave it like that so we can see how it looks and it's going to save it on a folder named dist i'm going to leave it like that this can be whatever you want really i'm going to leave it like that i'm going to save this and let's run this task let's do it let's do gulp css hit enter all right cool everything seems to work and now you'll notice that we have a new dist folder let's open that we have a style.css here and there you can now you now we can see that is and minified css file this is a good file that we can use on our production like this is what you're gonna you're gonna upload to your server it's gonna be very fast but this is what i don't like about the max length option thing is creating new lines for us so i'm just gonna remove that save it again i'm gonna run gulp css let's see if it change this is what i'm looking for so now we have only one line of code with all the css in that line of code and this is perfect this is what i like and now this is what i'm using on my website as you can see is getting from the dist folder style css and that's what i'm using so let's see if this is working right now all right so it's reading the css just fine everything looks looks great so let's close this and this we don't need it now all right but the thing is that now you need to go there and kind of use gold sass or gold css every time you want to do it and that's not what i want right you want everything to be automatically my goal is every time i change something in my sas file and hit save everything will change automatically i don't have to go here and type the task so let's go to gulpfile.js and let's add some stuff so i'm going to get a new task gulp dot task and this is gonna be called whatever i want but i'm gonna call it run and it's gonna run my sas task and my css task right that's cool but now i wanna go a little bit further so i'm gonna write another task and this one is gonna be called watch and we're going to run a function for this one all right and this is the one that i like this is the one that is going to do everything for you automatically without touching the command line okay so we're going to do gulp watch and the files that we want to watch every time every every time i change my sas file so let's go and sass if i change any file with the sas is gonna run my sass sorry like this okay same thing with css so if my css changes i want to go so let's go to the folder oops css same thing every single css that i have there is gonna run my css task all right so that's watch now i'm gonna create a task and it's going to be the default task so let's go there default now i'm gonna do i'm gonna run my run task and my watch task so when i say um default is gulp so if i if i write gulp is gonna give you an error right now because we don't have it yet but we created so let's save this file and now let's see if it works so let's go gulp oops sorry sorry sorry sorry we need a coma after the task name coma save it again let's clear this gulp and there you go so everything runs and now it's kind of a washing or file so gulp is kind of um watching you and if you make a change it will go again and run everything again all right if you want to get out of here of this watching state you just need to um hit ctrl c and you will see that we go like back to normal all right but that's not what what i want so gold alright cool so let's go to the sas all right make sure you're watching this because i want to know if it changed so make sure you're watching this let's go to the sas file let's change i don't know the font size for example let's save it all right let's reload the page and it's changing so every time i save my sash file is compiling my file is doing all this compiling my file to css is getting my css and minifying my css and then it's washing our files every time we do this so it's kind of an automated workflow and this is only the basics okay this is very simple right now this can be very very complicated you can save your file it can do a ton of things you can do everything with javascript for example this is only css we can um we can run prefixes we can do javascript minify too we can do babel so you can um you can do a ton of things with gulp this is only the basics with with a sass file compile and stuff like that so i hope you like this that's it
