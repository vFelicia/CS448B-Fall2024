00:00 - hey everybody welcome back to code 30
00:02 - things in 30 days with css3
00:04 - today is day number nine and we are
00:07 - going to be building some modern
00:08 - layouts using css we're going to
00:12 - be using some media queries and we're
00:14 - going to play around to create some
00:15 - modern layouts so i'm going to show you
00:16 - here in my browser
00:18 - the final result i'm going to scroll
00:20 - down here
00:21 - we have modern layout number one just
00:24 - this is basically just a structure so
00:25 - we're not creating like a web page or
00:27 - anything per se we're actually just
00:29 - almost wireframing in the browser so you
00:31 - can see here we have the header this
00:34 - blue background is what um
00:37 - delineates the header
00:39 - down here we have an article with body
00:41 - text and over here we have an aside so
00:43 - we're using html5 for this and then at
00:45 - the bottom we have a footer and so we're
00:47 - going to style that to create that
00:49 - layout and then obviously you can use
00:50 - that layout to create modern uh basic
00:53 - modern blog layout modern layout number
00:55 - two
00:56 - we have a header up here again with a
00:58 - logo on the left side and a simple
01:00 - navigation on the right side we have a
01:03 - left hand
01:04 - sidebar using an aside html5 tag an
01:08 - article in the center and then a right
01:09 - hand
01:10 - content sidebar and then the footer and
01:13 - modern layout number three uh we have
01:15 - basically a little bit of a flipping on
01:18 - the
01:19 - header here so we have the navigation on
01:20 - the left the logo on the right then
01:22 - three articles in a three column grid
01:24 - and then the footer and so
01:27 - up here we're going to be working with
01:29 - that in our sandbox we have the i have
01:31 - the html already written for you all you
01:34 - have to do is use the css to
01:37 - create those layouts and so we're going
01:39 - to do that today in this lesson day
01:42 - number nine let's jump into our code
01:44 - editor so
01:45 - download modern layouts in this lesson
01:48 - go ahead and do that get yourself
01:49 - started pause the video do what you need
01:50 - to do and then open up the sandbox.css
01:55 - feel free to familiarize yourself with
01:57 - the codes the html and the final css so
02:00 - this is the html you can see here
02:03 - that in the sandbox we're using
02:06 - uh
02:07 - html5 tags so sections headers articles
02:10 - asides and footers and we're just
02:14 - identifying each section with a class so
02:17 - that we know which
02:20 - section we are styling in our css
02:22 - and there's a little bit more involved
02:24 - in each example in each layout example
02:27 - and then in the final css you can see
02:29 - all of the final css so if you need to
02:32 - go ahead and refer to that for
02:35 - a reference or anything like that you
02:37 - can certainly do that jump in your
02:38 - sandbox with css and let's get started
02:42 - with
02:43 - the very first layout modern layout
02:46 - number one
02:48 - all right let's start with uh the class
02:50 - of layout one
02:53 - article so i'm selecting the class of
02:55 - layout one in our in our index here you
02:58 - can see each of the sections are
03:00 - uh titled with a class layout one two
03:02 - and three respectively we're gonna start
03:04 - with layout one article we're gonna give
03:06 - it a width of 58 percent
03:09 - and then we're going to float that left
03:11 - let's move down and style the layout one
03:14 - aside we're going to simply give that a
03:17 - width of 40 percent
03:19 - and float that right
03:23 - and then we're going to go ahead and say
03:25 - layout 1 and then footer
03:28 - we're going to clear both because we
03:29 - want we need a clear fix for that that's
03:31 - going to create an issue it's going to
03:32 - collapse the two floats are going to
03:34 - collapse that uh on each other so the
03:37 - footer is going to create an issue but i
03:38 - want to actually just hide that for now
03:40 - and let's see what we have in our
03:41 - browser let's head over to our sandbox
03:44 - and you can see here the header is fine
03:46 - we haven't done anything with the header
03:47 - we have the article which is the
03:50 - uh well the article tag and it's floated
03:52 - at 58
03:54 - and then we have the aside at 40 so
03:57 - those fit nicely but of course uh the
03:59 - footer here is collapsed up into those
04:02 - elements and that's because it needs to
04:03 - be cleared it's a very common um
04:06 - web design issue when you're coding with
04:08 - floats
04:10 - so all we have to do here in our browser
04:12 - sorry in our code editor is clear both
04:15 - you can do clear left or clear right but
04:17 - we're going to clear both so that we can
04:18 - just
04:19 - get it over with so now back in our
04:21 - browser you can see that that modern
04:22 - layout number one is complete and it
04:25 - looks
04:26 - fantastic that literally took seconds
04:28 - now let's move down to modern layout
04:29 - number two this one is where we're going
04:31 - to have the logo be on the left side the
04:33 - navigation on the right we're going to
04:35 - play with the aside the article and the
04:36 - side so we have two sidebars and content
04:38 - in the center so jump back into your
04:40 - code editor give yourself some space
04:43 - and we're going to
04:47 - add modern layout number two
04:51 - using our
04:52 - styling conventions we're going to
04:55 - select layout 2 the class and then we're
04:58 - going to select the header within that
04:59 - and then logo so pretty specific
05:01 - selector
05:03 - and we're going to say width for the
05:05 - logo is 20
05:07 - we're going to float that left and then
05:10 - we're going to give it a margin of zero
05:14 - now if we go below that we're going to
05:16 - do another thing here and we're going to
05:18 - say layout to
05:19 - header and nav
05:22 - all html5 tags here
05:24 - trying to be as semantic as possible
05:27 - with
05:28 - 78
05:30 - and we're gonna say float right
05:33 - margin zero let's save that and see what
05:36 - happened in our browser so we have the
05:40 - layout looking nice
05:42 - for the logo and the navigation we're
05:44 - using the 20 and 78
05:47 - and the problem here is
05:50 - uh the parent container the header has
05:54 - collapsed on itself because now it has
05:56 - nothing to hold it open and that's where
05:58 - we're going to use a clear fix so let's
06:00 - jump back into our code editor and we're
06:02 - going to do a little bit more um solid
06:04 - of a clear fix here it's a little bit
06:06 - different because this is the parent
06:07 - container that's collapsing rather than
06:09 - a sibling element that uh kind of
06:13 - collapses
06:14 - within uh you know up into those the
06:16 - layout that we created in our modern
06:18 - layout number one the parent
06:21 - uh container here is collapsing on
06:22 - itself so we're going to do a little bit
06:24 - different of a clear fix so i'm going to
06:25 - say
06:27 - and it's uh it's very simple and very
06:29 - nice so we're going to say
06:31 - layout
06:32 - 2. header
06:36 - this is going to be a virtual last child
06:40 - a little pseudo element there
06:43 - and then we're going to say display is
06:45 - table
06:46 - content will be just an empty string and
06:50 - then we're going to clear both
06:51 - that's going to create an element a
06:53 - pseudo element using the header after so
06:56 - at the end of the header there's like
06:58 - kind of a ghost element that you can
06:59 - create using this pseudo element here
07:02 - and we're going to make a display table
07:04 - that can't collapse the content has to
07:06 - be
07:07 - an empty string for the pseudo-elements
07:09 - because if there is no content it won't
07:11 - appear but if you have content and we're
07:13 - just going to have an empty string you
07:14 - could put text in here and that will
07:16 - show up but we don't want that and clear
07:18 - both just to cover our bases let's head
07:20 - over and see what happened in our
07:22 - browser okay over here we're going to go
07:24 - down to modern layout 2 and that solved
07:26 - the problem
07:28 - right here so the logo the navigation
07:30 - and the header all look good because of
07:31 - our simple
07:33 - clear fix to prevent collapse let's move
07:35 - on back in our code editor
07:37 - we're going to jump down and we're going
07:39 - to style our article
07:42 - so we're going to say layout layout2
07:44 - article
07:45 - we're going to give that a width of 50
07:47 - of the entire container parent container
07:50 - margin left we're going to say 2 percent
07:54 - and we're going to float that left
07:58 - and let's
07:59 - select again here the layout to
08:02 - a side and a class of side nav so that
08:05 - is the aside html5 tag with the class of
08:08 - sidenav
08:09 - so that is going to be a navigation on
08:11 - the probably the left-hand side here
08:13 - let's say width is 23 percent
08:17 - and we're going to float that left
08:19 - and then let's move down one more
08:21 - layout two
08:24 - and we're going to say a side
08:26 - and a sidebar which will be on the
08:28 - right-hand side
08:29 - and we're going to say width
08:31 - 23
08:33 - and
08:34 - we're going to float that right
08:38 - we're going to save that check it out in
08:40 - our browser modern layout number two
08:43 - so we have excuse me our left navigation
08:46 - bar here our article and our sidebar
08:50 - great the problem is our footer is
08:51 - collapsing up into those elements
08:55 - you guessed it we need to clear fix but
08:57 - we're just gonna we're just gonna
08:58 - actually just do a simple clear rather
09:00 - than the the clear fix we used for the
09:02 - header so let's
09:04 - select the layout two
09:06 - and then we're gonna select footer and
09:08 - simply say clear
09:10 - both
09:12 - that will solve the problem over here in
09:14 - our browser
09:15 - that looks good modern layout number two
09:18 - beautiful now let's jump into modern
09:20 - layout number three
09:22 - that one is going to be where the logo
09:23 - is on the right the navigation's on the
09:25 - left three column grid for the articles
09:27 - and then the footer at the bottom
09:29 - so let's jump back into our code editor
09:32 - and we're going to give a little comment
09:34 - here and say modern
09:37 - layout number three
09:41 - and let's select layout
09:43 - three
09:45 - header and then logo
09:48 - width is twenty 20
09:50 - float right and margin zero
09:55 - layout three
09:58 - header
10:00 - nav
10:01 - and we're going to say
10:03 - width 78
10:06 - float left and then margin zero
10:11 - and now that is going to create a
10:12 - problem with the header being collapsed
10:14 - like we did before so we can type that
10:16 - out again layout number three
10:19 - header pseudo element after we're gonna
10:22 - display table
10:24 - we're gonna
10:25 - add the content as an empty string and
10:27 - clear both i will solve the problem for
10:30 - that so let's go back and check out
10:32 - modern layout number three our header
10:34 - looks
10:35 - perfect with our navigation and our logo
10:37 - now let's make those that three column
10:39 - grid with the articles
10:41 - we're gonna say
10:42 - layout three
10:45 - three
10:47 - article we're gonna select all of them
10:49 - we're gonna say width
10:50 - 32
10:52 - float left
10:54 - and margin zero two percent zero zero
10:58 - now if i save that and we view that in
11:00 - our browser
11:01 - let's see what we have
11:03 - we
11:04 - it looks like we have an issue so we
11:06 - have two articles here
11:08 - the other article is falling down here
11:10 - and it's falling behind the final result
11:13 - element so there's one two and three so
11:15 - there's a problem there let's jump back
11:17 - over the reason what the re what that
11:19 - problem is in fact just to tell you is
11:21 - there's a two percent margin on the
11:23 - right of each of these articles so
11:25 - that means there's no space for it to
11:27 - fit on this right side so if we remove
11:30 - that two percent margin on that last
11:32 - element it will fit perfectly fine so
11:33 - let's go ahead and do that
11:36 - so i'm just going to have a comment so
11:38 - we know what's going on
11:40 - clear the margin the last article to
11:42 - allow it to fit within the layout simple
11:44 - layout three
11:46 - article
11:48 - last child
11:50 - we're selecting the last child cool css3
11:53 - trick there margin zero so instead of
11:55 - giving it an id or a class and then
11:57 - styling that class it's just messy not
11:59 - very semantic we're just using css to
12:01 - style that we're not messing with the
12:03 - presentation or the html we're just
12:05 - specifically using css three to fix that
12:07 - problem
12:08 - awesome now this is going to create
12:10 - collapse which we've seen so we're going
12:12 - to do the simple clear fix again we're
12:15 - going to go layout 3
12:18 - we're going to select
12:20 - the articles
12:22 - element
12:23 - that is the parent element of the three
12:25 - html5 articles and the after
12:29 - uh pseudo element
12:32 - uh at the end of the articles div
12:35 - we're gonna say
12:38 - display
12:39 - table
12:40 - content empty string
12:42 - clear both that will solve that problem
12:45 - let's view that in our browser all right
12:48 - and here we are modern layout number
12:50 - three that layout looks awesome we have
12:52 - everything lined up the footer is being
12:54 - cleared so we don't have any more
12:55 - problems there that looks good
12:58 - and now
13:00 - we could leave it as is but it wouldn't
13:02 - be a modern layout if it wasn't
13:04 - responsive so we're just going to do a
13:06 - really
13:07 - simple responsive fix here so if i were
13:10 - to actually adjust this
13:13 - you can see
13:14 - that
13:15 - the percentage maintains the layout but
13:18 - the
13:18 - text it doesn't really look very good so
13:21 - it's not actually that nice the layouts
13:23 - will maintain regardless of the size of
13:25 - the window but we don't actually want
13:27 - that because you have two to three words
13:29 - per line and that's incredibly
13:31 - unreadable and we don't want that so
13:33 - basically all i want to do is remove all
13:36 - the
13:37 - floats and the widths
13:39 - and just reset that so everything stacks
13:42 - when you get to
13:44 - 768 pixels which is like a
13:47 - like a brand new iphone in
13:49 - [Music]
13:52 - horizontal or landscape
13:54 - viewport mode so let's go over to our
13:57 - sandbox.css
13:59 - and we're going to
14:00 - leave a comment and i'm just going to
14:02 - say simple media queries
14:05 - for
14:06 - responsive
14:08 - layouts
14:09 - and then we're going to select the media
14:12 - at media screen
14:14 - and
14:16 - there's many ways to write media queries
14:18 - this way is just a nice simple way
14:21 - of selecting a specific one
14:23 - so this is
14:24 - media screen and max width in
14:26 - parentheses
14:28 - the value is 768 pixels that means
14:31 - screens not print or like a
14:34 - like a like a reading device like a
14:36 - kindle or something like that
14:38 - screens such as your computer or
14:41 - mobile devices
14:43 - and max width this is the most important
14:45 - part of the media query the max width
14:48 - of the viewport being 768 pixels and you
14:51 - can find that information online really
14:52 - easily the viewports the common
14:55 - viewports
14:56 - for excuse me media queries
14:59 - so i'm gonna select
15:00 - layout one i'm gonna do this uh
15:03 - basically
15:05 - i can combine a whole bunch of selectors
15:06 - here so
15:07 - article
15:08 - comma
15:10 - i'm gonna go layout one aside
15:13 - layout
15:14 - two header logo
15:17 - layout two
15:18 - header nav
15:20 - layout two
15:22 - article
15:24 - layout two
15:26 - aside
15:29 - and the class of
15:33 - side nav
15:36 - and also
15:39 - class of sidebar
15:41 - and then we're gonna go layout three
15:44 - article
15:46 - layout three
15:48 - aside
15:50 - layout three
15:53 - header
15:54 - class of uh
15:56 - something with the header with the class
15:57 - of logo i'm selecting logo within header
16:00 - whoops
16:01 - comma just one more here
16:03 - layout three
16:05 - header nav
16:07 - now it's possible
16:08 - i could have what i could have done here
16:10 - instead of written everything out is
16:12 - just selected all articles all asides
16:14 - all headers but then i'd also have to
16:15 - select all logos side nav sidebars that
16:17 - would be fine too would be probably
16:19 - in fact it would be a much cleaner
16:21 - selector but i just wanted to be
16:23 - specific in this case
16:25 - float
16:27 - none
16:29 - width 100 percent and the margin gonna
16:31 - reset everything to zero two percent z
16:33 - uh sorry zero zero two percent
16:37 - like that save it and then check it out
16:39 - in your browser let's see how these all
16:41 - stack when i make this viewport smaller
16:45 - so 768 should pop up here soon
16:48 - there we go that was 768 around there
16:51 - see that switch
16:54 - so now all the layouts just stack and
16:56 - they have two percent margin on the
16:57 - bottom of each element so it's just a
17:00 - nice simple
17:02 - responsive
17:04 - layout
17:05 - so those are some basic
17:06 - modern layouts using css3 and media
17:09 - queries that's it for today's lesson day
17:12 - nine modern layouts hope uh this shed
17:16 - some valuable insight onto on how to use
17:18 - css3 to create some pretty
17:19 - straightforward layouts a lot of these
17:21 - layouts are what you see in uh common
17:23 - and popular web pages nowadays and these
17:26 - uh these layouts kind of concepts you
17:28 - can modify them and change all the sizes
17:30 - and the widths and and organize things
17:32 - in whatever way you want and that's the
17:34 - beauty of css3 you're you have the
17:36 - flexibility to do literally whatever you
17:38 - want in terms of creating layouts so
17:41 - hopefully those examples were nice and
17:43 - simple and kind of gave you some ideas
17:45 - thanks for hanging out with me today
17:47 - with day number nine and i'll see you
17:49 - tomorrow for day 10.

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome back to code 30 things in 30 days with css3 today is day number nine and we are going to be building some modern layouts using css we're going to be using some media queries and we're going to play around to create some modern layouts so i'm going to show you here in my browser the final result i'm going to scroll down here we have modern layout number one just this is basically just a structure so we're not creating like a web page or anything per se we're actually just almost wireframing in the browser so you can see here we have the header this blue background is what um delineates the header down here we have an article with body text and over here we have an aside so we're using html5 for this and then at the bottom we have a footer and so we're going to style that to create that layout and then obviously you can use that layout to create modern uh basic modern blog layout modern layout number two we have a header up here again with a logo on the left side and a simple navigation on the right side we have a left hand sidebar using an aside html5 tag an article in the center and then a right hand content sidebar and then the footer and modern layout number three uh we have basically a little bit of a flipping on the header here so we have the navigation on the left the logo on the right then three articles in a three column grid and then the footer and so up here we're going to be working with that in our sandbox we have the i have the html already written for you all you have to do is use the css to create those layouts and so we're going to do that today in this lesson day number nine let's jump into our code editor so download modern layouts in this lesson go ahead and do that get yourself started pause the video do what you need to do and then open up the sandbox.css feel free to familiarize yourself with the codes the html and the final css so this is the html you can see here that in the sandbox we're using uh html5 tags so sections headers articles asides and footers and we're just identifying each section with a class so that we know which section we are styling in our css and there's a little bit more involved in each example in each layout example and then in the final css you can see all of the final css so if you need to go ahead and refer to that for a reference or anything like that you can certainly do that jump in your sandbox with css and let's get started with the very first layout modern layout number one all right let's start with uh the class of layout one article so i'm selecting the class of layout one in our in our index here you can see each of the sections are uh titled with a class layout one two and three respectively we're gonna start with layout one article we're gonna give it a width of 58 percent and then we're going to float that left let's move down and style the layout one aside we're going to simply give that a width of 40 percent and float that right and then we're going to go ahead and say layout 1 and then footer we're going to clear both because we want we need a clear fix for that that's going to create an issue it's going to collapse the two floats are going to collapse that uh on each other so the footer is going to create an issue but i want to actually just hide that for now and let's see what we have in our browser let's head over to our sandbox and you can see here the header is fine we haven't done anything with the header we have the article which is the uh well the article tag and it's floated at 58 and then we have the aside at 40 so those fit nicely but of course uh the footer here is collapsed up into those elements and that's because it needs to be cleared it's a very common um web design issue when you're coding with floats so all we have to do here in our browser sorry in our code editor is clear both you can do clear left or clear right but we're going to clear both so that we can just get it over with so now back in our browser you can see that that modern layout number one is complete and it looks fantastic that literally took seconds now let's move down to modern layout number two this one is where we're going to have the logo be on the left side the navigation on the right we're going to play with the aside the article and the side so we have two sidebars and content in the center so jump back into your code editor give yourself some space and we're going to add modern layout number two using our styling conventions we're going to select layout 2 the class and then we're going to select the header within that and then logo so pretty specific selector and we're going to say width for the logo is 20 we're going to float that left and then we're going to give it a margin of zero now if we go below that we're going to do another thing here and we're going to say layout to header and nav all html5 tags here trying to be as semantic as possible with 78 and we're gonna say float right margin zero let's save that and see what happened in our browser so we have the layout looking nice for the logo and the navigation we're using the 20 and 78 and the problem here is uh the parent container the header has collapsed on itself because now it has nothing to hold it open and that's where we're going to use a clear fix so let's jump back into our code editor and we're going to do a little bit more um solid of a clear fix here it's a little bit different because this is the parent container that's collapsing rather than a sibling element that uh kind of collapses within uh you know up into those the layout that we created in our modern layout number one the parent uh container here is collapsing on itself so we're going to do a little bit different of a clear fix so i'm going to say and it's uh it's very simple and very nice so we're going to say layout 2. header this is going to be a virtual last child a little pseudo element there and then we're going to say display is table content will be just an empty string and then we're going to clear both that's going to create an element a pseudo element using the header after so at the end of the header there's like kind of a ghost element that you can create using this pseudo element here and we're going to make a display table that can't collapse the content has to be an empty string for the pseudoelements because if there is no content it won't appear but if you have content and we're just going to have an empty string you could put text in here and that will show up but we don't want that and clear both just to cover our bases let's head over and see what happened in our browser okay over here we're going to go down to modern layout 2 and that solved the problem right here so the logo the navigation and the header all look good because of our simple clear fix to prevent collapse let's move on back in our code editor we're going to jump down and we're going to style our article so we're going to say layout layout2 article we're going to give that a width of 50 of the entire container parent container margin left we're going to say 2 percent and we're going to float that left and let's select again here the layout to a side and a class of side nav so that is the aside html5 tag with the class of sidenav so that is going to be a navigation on the probably the lefthand side here let's say width is 23 percent and we're going to float that left and then let's move down one more layout two and we're going to say a side and a sidebar which will be on the righthand side and we're going to say width 23 and we're going to float that right we're going to save that check it out in our browser modern layout number two so we have excuse me our left navigation bar here our article and our sidebar great the problem is our footer is collapsing up into those elements you guessed it we need to clear fix but we're just gonna we're just gonna actually just do a simple clear rather than the the clear fix we used for the header so let's select the layout two and then we're gonna select footer and simply say clear both that will solve the problem over here in our browser that looks good modern layout number two beautiful now let's jump into modern layout number three that one is going to be where the logo is on the right the navigation's on the left three column grid for the articles and then the footer at the bottom so let's jump back into our code editor and we're going to give a little comment here and say modern layout number three and let's select layout three header and then logo width is twenty 20 float right and margin zero layout three header nav and we're going to say width 78 float left and then margin zero and now that is going to create a problem with the header being collapsed like we did before so we can type that out again layout number three header pseudo element after we're gonna display table we're gonna add the content as an empty string and clear both i will solve the problem for that so let's go back and check out modern layout number three our header looks perfect with our navigation and our logo now let's make those that three column grid with the articles we're gonna say layout three three article we're gonna select all of them we're gonna say width 32 float left and margin zero two percent zero zero now if i save that and we view that in our browser let's see what we have we it looks like we have an issue so we have two articles here the other article is falling down here and it's falling behind the final result element so there's one two and three so there's a problem there let's jump back over the reason what the re what that problem is in fact just to tell you is there's a two percent margin on the right of each of these articles so that means there's no space for it to fit on this right side so if we remove that two percent margin on that last element it will fit perfectly fine so let's go ahead and do that so i'm just going to have a comment so we know what's going on clear the margin the last article to allow it to fit within the layout simple layout three article last child we're selecting the last child cool css3 trick there margin zero so instead of giving it an id or a class and then styling that class it's just messy not very semantic we're just using css to style that we're not messing with the presentation or the html we're just specifically using css three to fix that problem awesome now this is going to create collapse which we've seen so we're going to do the simple clear fix again we're going to go layout 3 we're going to select the articles element that is the parent element of the three html5 articles and the after uh pseudo element uh at the end of the articles div we're gonna say display table content empty string clear both that will solve that problem let's view that in our browser all right and here we are modern layout number three that layout looks awesome we have everything lined up the footer is being cleared so we don't have any more problems there that looks good and now we could leave it as is but it wouldn't be a modern layout if it wasn't responsive so we're just going to do a really simple responsive fix here so if i were to actually adjust this you can see that the percentage maintains the layout but the text it doesn't really look very good so it's not actually that nice the layouts will maintain regardless of the size of the window but we don't actually want that because you have two to three words per line and that's incredibly unreadable and we don't want that so basically all i want to do is remove all the floats and the widths and just reset that so everything stacks when you get to 768 pixels which is like a like a brand new iphone in horizontal or landscape viewport mode so let's go over to our sandbox.css and we're going to leave a comment and i'm just going to say simple media queries for responsive layouts and then we're going to select the media at media screen and there's many ways to write media queries this way is just a nice simple way of selecting a specific one so this is media screen and max width in parentheses the value is 768 pixels that means screens not print or like a like a like a reading device like a kindle or something like that screens such as your computer or mobile devices and max width this is the most important part of the media query the max width of the viewport being 768 pixels and you can find that information online really easily the viewports the common viewports for excuse me media queries so i'm gonna select layout one i'm gonna do this uh basically i can combine a whole bunch of selectors here so article comma i'm gonna go layout one aside layout two header logo layout two header nav layout two article layout two aside and the class of side nav and also class of sidebar and then we're gonna go layout three article layout three aside layout three header class of uh something with the header with the class of logo i'm selecting logo within header whoops comma just one more here layout three header nav now it's possible i could have what i could have done here instead of written everything out is just selected all articles all asides all headers but then i'd also have to select all logos side nav sidebars that would be fine too would be probably in fact it would be a much cleaner selector but i just wanted to be specific in this case float none width 100 percent and the margin gonna reset everything to zero two percent z uh sorry zero zero two percent like that save it and then check it out in your browser let's see how these all stack when i make this viewport smaller so 768 should pop up here soon there we go that was 768 around there see that switch so now all the layouts just stack and they have two percent margin on the bottom of each element so it's just a nice simple responsive layout so those are some basic modern layouts using css3 and media queries that's it for today's lesson day nine modern layouts hope uh this shed some valuable insight onto on how to use css3 to create some pretty straightforward layouts a lot of these layouts are what you see in uh common and popular web pages nowadays and these uh these layouts kind of concepts you can modify them and change all the sizes and the widths and and organize things in whatever way you want and that's the beauty of css3 you're you have the flexibility to do literally whatever you want in terms of creating layouts so hopefully those examples were nice and simple and kind of gave you some ideas thanks for hanging out with me today with day number nine and i'll see you tomorrow for day 10.
