00:00 - hi i'm beau carnes with free code camp
00:02 - in this course i'm going to show you how
00:04 - to get your own website onto the
00:06 - internet
00:07 - i'll show you how to create a website
00:09 - get a custom domain name which is the
00:12 - url people type in to get to your
00:13 - website
00:15 - host your website
00:16 - which is where the files for your
00:18 - website are stored
00:19 - configure dns settings and set up a
00:22 - custom email address
00:24 - if you are just interested in one of
00:26 - these topics check the description of
00:28 - this video for links to the individual
00:30 - sections
00:31 - let's get started
00:37 - you may already have files for your
00:39 - website that you want to put onto the
00:41 - internet in that case skip to this time
00:43 - shown on the screen right now or just go
00:46 - to the next section in the progress bar
00:48 - of this video
00:49 - in this section i'm going to go over how
00:51 - to create a website
00:53 - i assume you already know what your
00:55 - website is going to be about
00:57 - two common ways to create a website are
00:59 - to create it using html css and
01:02 - javascript or you can use a content
01:04 - management system like wordpress
01:06 - wordpress allows you to create a website
01:08 - without knowing how to code
01:10 - the simplest way to create a wordpress
01:12 - website is to get your hosting first
01:14 - so in the section of this video about
01:16 - hosting i'll show you how to install
01:18 - wordpress right now though i'll show you
01:20 - how to create a site using html css and
01:22 - javascript
01:24 - for this example i'm going to create a
01:26 - landing page for different programming
01:28 - courses i've developed
01:30 - this will be a simple site based on a
01:32 - template just to get you started if you
01:35 - want to learn how to make more complex
01:36 - sites check out the playlist linked to
01:38 - in the description html css and
01:41 - javascript are all just text stored in
01:43 - text files
01:44 - html describes the structure of your
01:46 - website and css describes the style and
01:49 - how it looks
01:51 - javascript adds additional interactivity
01:53 - and functionality
01:54 - while you can create these files in any
01:56 - text editor it's common to use a source
01:59 - code editor such as visual studio code
02:02 - this makes it easier to write html and
02:04 - css and even javascript or other
02:06 - programming languages so first let's
02:08 - download visual studio code
02:12 - so if we just go to the main website and
02:14 - download from mac or whatever operating
02:17 - system you have i won't show the whole
02:18 - installation process because well i
02:21 - already have installed
02:22 - and it's different for each operating
02:24 - system so let's go right over to visual
02:26 - studio code
02:28 - okay we have visual studio code and now
02:30 - we can create the website so this is
02:32 - what it looks like when you first start
02:33 - up visual studio code we could just
02:36 - click new file and create the new html
02:38 - file in the new css file
02:41 - but we're going to do something a little
02:42 - different
02:43 - if you're just starting out it can
02:45 - sometimes be helpful to start with a
02:47 - website template
02:49 - this just means starter code for your
02:51 - website that you can customize for your
02:52 - needs
02:54 - this can be an excellent way to learn
02:56 - you can see html and css that someone
02:58 - else has created and then you can start
03:00 - to understand how it works together
03:02 - there are a bunch of sites offering
03:04 - templates one of them is templated.co
03:07 - there are a bunch of templates to choose
03:09 - from i'm going to choose this one called
03:11 - full motion because it includes a
03:13 - responsive video gallery and my page is
03:15 - supposed to help people watch video
03:17 - courses i've created
03:19 - so i'll just click download here
03:22 - but you can download the other ones if
03:24 - one of the other ones meets your needs a
03:26 - little better
03:27 - so after it's downloaded and unzipped i
03:29 - can just go to visual studio code click
03:32 - open folder and then i'll navigate to
03:34 - the folder and click open
03:38 - and now
03:39 - we can see everything on the side here
03:42 - this is the file browser
03:44 - i can just close this welcome screen
03:46 - i don't need that anymore
03:48 - i'm going to open up the index.html
03:52 - now when you're creating a website the
03:53 - main file is almost always called
03:55 - index.html so that's the thing that
03:57 - you're going to want to edit
03:59 - we're going to be modifying the html
04:01 - file in css file you don't need to know
04:03 - everything to modify a template but you
04:05 - should know the basics of how html and
04:07 - css are structured i'm just going to
04:10 - give you a very brief overview if you
04:12 - want to learn more about html and css
04:14 - check the links in the description
04:17 - so you can see this is an example of a
04:19 - paragraph tag that's what the p stands
04:22 - for paragraph
04:23 - and every html tag is going to have an
04:26 - opening tag which is this section right
04:28 - here and a closing tag which is this
04:32 - final section right here
04:34 - and in between the tags in between the
04:36 - the opening paragraph tag and the
04:39 - closing paragraph tag is where text
04:42 - would normally be the text in here would
04:44 - be the paragraph and this opening tag
04:48 - and then closing tag designates the
04:50 - beginning of the paragraph and the
04:52 - ending of the paragraph and you can see
04:55 - in the opening tag there's an id
04:58 - this id is an attribute and the
05:00 - attribute of id is set to
05:03 - my id
05:04 - now the id is often used to identify a
05:08 - certain tag or a certain section of your
05:10 - website
05:12 - for use in the css and the javascript
05:16 - so inside an opening tag there can be
05:18 - all sorts of different attributes and
05:20 - you'll see some other examples when i go
05:22 - to the other code so let's look at this
05:25 - diagram this shows how an html page is
05:29 - structured you can see there's branching
05:32 - sections almost like a tree it's a tree
05:34 - structure so we have our overall
05:36 - document and then we have our root
05:38 - element which is the html element so
05:41 - you'll have an htm an opening html tag
05:43 - and a closing html tag
05:46 - and then everything will be inside that
05:48 - tag so you'll have a head section a
05:50 - opening head tag and a closing head tag
05:53 - and inside the head section there'll be
05:55 - a title with some text and then there'll
05:58 - be a body section with a opening body
06:01 - tag and a closing body tag and then
06:03 - within the body there's going to be the
06:05 - different components that are going to
06:07 - make up the body of the website
06:09 - everything nests inside other elements
06:13 - you'll see more of what i mean once we
06:14 - get to the code also you're going to
06:16 - need to know about css so css is used to
06:20 - style the html so in this case we have
06:24 - the body selector
06:25 - so this first board is the selector and
06:28 - this is going to style everything within
06:31 - the body html tag
06:33 - and in this case it's going to set the
06:35 - color to this hex value
06:38 - so css
06:39 - is always going to have a selector the
06:41 - most common things to select are tags
06:44 - like a body tag or an id
06:46 - or a class you can add a specific class
06:49 - any html tag and then you can style in
06:51 - the html section that has that class
06:54 - i'll show you some examples when we get
06:55 - to the actual code so let's go to the
06:57 - code so every html file is going to
07:00 - start with this
07:01 - this is just saying that this is an html
07:03 - file
07:04 - so here you can see the html tag
07:07 - and at the very end we have the closing
07:09 - html tag
07:12 - and you can see there's a line here that
07:14 - connects in
07:15 - everything is indented so within this
07:17 - html tag there is a head section
07:20 - you can see the opening head tag and the
07:22 - closing head tag and within the head
07:24 - section we have a title section
07:26 - and we have these metas
07:28 - and then we have a link here
07:31 - so you can see that within the heading
07:33 - of the page the main thing we have is
07:35 - the title
07:36 - right now it's called full motion
07:38 - so let's change that i'm going to change
07:41 - that to
07:42 - courses
07:45 - from beau carnes
07:48 - so this title will show up at the very
07:50 - top of the browser window often in the
07:53 - tabs
07:54 - if you have it open up to a specific tab
07:56 - that's where this title will show up
07:59 - so we have these meta tags which i'm
08:01 - just going to skip over for now because
08:03 - they're not super important to what i'm
08:05 - talking about now
08:06 - but this next line is important
08:08 - this is how the html file is linked to
08:11 - the css file so you can see that
08:14 - this is href the reference of the css
08:17 - file is this is this thing here assets
08:21 - css slash main.css
08:23 - so let's go over to this in the file
08:25 - browser under assets css and then
08:28 - main.css
08:30 - that's this file right here
08:32 - so this line is connecting our html file
08:35 - to the css file
08:37 - now let's look at this next section this
08:39 - body section oh yeah you can see some of
08:41 - this is grayed out that's because this
08:44 - is a comment
08:45 - so comments can be used to put something
08:47 - in your html file that's not going to
08:49 - appear on your final page
08:51 - or it's not going to be read by the
08:52 - browser so this section this whole next
08:55 - section you can see the body tag starts
08:57 - here and goes all the way down to here
08:59 - the rest of the page is basically the
09:01 - body
09:02 - or what's going to be shown in the
09:03 - browser when someone goes to your
09:04 - website
09:06 - it starts with this top section and this
09:08 - top section has an id of banner and this
09:11 - it says
09:12 - data dash video equals images banner
09:15 - these things can be both referenced from
09:18 - the css
09:19 - and from the javascript
09:21 - and it's going to use javascript to play
09:23 - a video in the top banner actually let's
09:26 - look at that right now let's go over to
09:27 - the website
09:29 - this is what the website looks like you
09:31 - can see it has the title the page here
09:33 - this is not the same title that we just
09:35 - changed the name of we're going to
09:36 - change that in a second you can see this
09:38 - video plays in the background and if you
09:40 - scroll down well you don't even need to
09:41 - scroll down if you click this button it
09:43 - scrolls down automatically and you can
09:46 - see these different boxes here and if we
09:48 - click watch it will open up and it will
09:50 - have a youtube video
09:52 - so we're going to update this so it goes
09:54 - to my youtube videos
09:57 - if we just scroll down we can see the
09:58 - rest of what the page started out as
10:03 - if you look at this text it's not
10:04 - english this is latin it's common to use
10:07 - latin text or lorem ipsum text as
10:10 - placeholder text
10:13 - on templates and any websites where you
10:15 - don't know what the text is going to be
10:17 - yet but we'll be updating that as we
10:19 - update the template so let's go back
10:21 - over here
10:23 - one very common tag in html is a div tag
10:26 - and that just means a divider or some
10:28 - special section that you're going to
10:30 - style in a specific way with the css you
10:33 - can see this has a class of inner and
10:36 - the css is going to be used to style
10:38 - anything that has a class of inner in a
10:40 - special way so let's go into this header
10:42 - section right here i'm going to change
10:44 - this to courses
10:48 - from beau carnes
10:50 - and this time if i save this
10:53 - and i go back to the page i'm going to
10:55 - refresh and i'll go to the top and you
10:57 - can see courses from beau carnes
11:00 - so this is what i'm talking about you
11:02 - can change a template and it's a lot
11:04 - easier than just writing everything from
11:06 - scratch
11:07 - let's go back to our code
11:09 - you can see this is an h1 tag that means
11:12 - heading one or the top heading
11:14 - there's also h2 h3 as4 there's just
11:17 - different levels of heading and here's a
11:19 - paragraph tag
11:21 - i'll close this so we can see more of it
11:23 - here
11:24 - and so this is the opening paragraph tag
11:26 - if we go over we can see the closing
11:30 - paragraph tag
11:33 - and i'm going to update this whole
11:34 - paragraph between the opening tag and
11:36 - the ending tag with an all new paragraph
11:39 - i'm just going to paste it in
11:42 - and so now it refers to what this new
11:45 - page is going to be about
11:47 - so i'll just save that and go back to
11:49 - the page
11:50 - and refresh and you can see it now has
11:52 - the new paragraph here
11:55 - okay let's go back to the code
11:57 - we can change this learn more or we can
11:59 - change it to something else now you can
12:01 - see this is an a tag or an anchor tag
12:04 - that's a link now you can use it to link
12:07 - to another page or you can link to
12:10 - another part of the same page so here
12:13 - you could add a link to another page
12:16 - like i could put free codecamp.org here
12:18 - and then when you clicked on it it would
12:20 - open up freecodcamp.org
12:22 - but since it says this half shine or
12:25 - pound sign main
12:26 - it's going to make it so it goes
12:28 - directly to the main section here which
12:31 - is right here it's going to a
12:33 - dividing section or a div that has an id
12:37 - of main
12:38 - so that's another
12:39 - way the ids are used so you can actually
12:42 - go to specific sections on your page so
12:45 - when you click learn more it's going to
12:47 - scroll down to this section here you can
12:50 - see that we have this div which divides
12:53 - this section of the page that's the main
12:55 - section that we scroll to
12:58 - and then we have another class called
13:00 - enter so this is probably something
13:02 - that's going to be used in the css file
13:05 - to style a specific section of the page
13:08 - and then we have another section called
13:10 - thumbnails
13:12 - so one thing that's kind of nice with
13:13 - visual studio code and with any code
13:15 - editor is these lines that come under a
13:19 - tag this will show where the ending tag
13:21 - is so this is the beginning tag if you
13:23 - click on it you can see this line is a
13:25 - little lighter so if we go all the way
13:27 - down
13:28 - it goes to here so here's the end of the
13:30 - tag here
13:34 - and so that's going to show this whole
13:36 - section this whole um this whole
13:39 - thumbnail section so the thumbnail
13:41 - section starts here and it goes to here
13:43 - where the closing div tag is so in this
13:46 - thumbnail section you can see there's a
13:48 - bunch of box sections so this is one
13:51 - whole box section right here but there's
13:54 - another box section here and then
13:56 - there's another box section here so
13:59 - there's a box for each thumbnail that's
14:01 - right in the page here so here this is
14:04 - what we're going to change one thing you
14:06 - can see here is that it's getting it's
14:08 - linking to a youtube
14:11 - video right here so the a href this is
14:14 - the anchor tag or what you're linking to
14:16 - and the link
14:18 - is
14:19 - surrounding an image
14:22 - so when it says img that's an image src
14:25 - is source and the source is this section
14:28 - right here the images slash pic01.jpg
14:31 - so if we actually go over to here in the
14:33 - file browser we should be able to find
14:36 - that oh here it is
14:38 - the pic001 so you can see that that's
14:41 - the same thing that you see right here
14:43 - so that's what we're going to have to
14:45 - recreate
14:46 - with my own videos
14:49 - you can also change the title so we see
14:52 - the h3 now h1 is a main heading h3 is
14:57 - like a level three heading so you can
14:58 - level one heading level two heading
15:00 - level three heading and we have a
15:02 - paragraph here so let's update this with
15:05 - one of my videos so i'm just gonna go
15:09 - and grab it from youtube here so just go
15:11 - to youtube.com
15:14 - and i'll actually go right to
15:15 - youtube.com
15:17 - freecodecamp
15:19 - i'm just going to get this javascript
15:21 - one this is the my most popular video
15:23 - that i've created so i'll do copy link
15:25 - address
15:26 - and i can go back over here
15:28 - and we'll paste this in here
15:31 - so now
15:32 - oh i just have to delete the time at the
15:35 - end
15:36 - and now we are going to
15:38 - get the image here now i could find the
15:42 - image and then put it right into this
15:43 - directory here and then then link to
15:46 - that image but i'm going to try a
15:48 - different method there's actually a url
15:51 - a direct url to each youtube thumbnail
15:55 - so i can put a actual file name here or
15:59 - i can put a url so i'm going to put a ur
16:01 - url here now it says there's actually
16:05 - a section to update with the video id so
16:07 - i just have to get the video id from
16:09 - right here
16:10 - i'm going to copy it and then i'm going
16:12 - to go over here
16:14 - and i will paste it
16:16 - now if i save this and then i go back to
16:19 - my website
16:20 - now i'm gonna refresh it
16:22 - okay so now we have the
16:25 - javascript in three hours here and if i
16:28 - click here
16:30 - hmm
16:30 - i was expecting the video to pop up
16:33 - so let's go back and troubleshoot
16:36 - because that's just a little
16:37 - black square
16:42 - okay i noticed that
16:44 - these ones have the short url and then i
16:47 - use the long url here so i'm just going
16:49 - to copy this little section and then put
16:52 - into here so we're using the short
16:54 - youtube url instead the long url so let
16:57 - me save that
16:58 - and i'm going to refresh
17:02 - okay and now the youtube video pops up
17:04 - and if i play
17:06 - yep it works
17:08 - so
17:09 - now i'm going to go back here and i have
17:12 - to update the rest of the stuff so this
17:14 - url i'm going to update for the button
17:16 - so this first link is just the image and
17:20 - now there's the button here so we need
17:22 - the link for the button
17:25 - and
17:27 - i can update the title
17:29 - javascript
17:33 - full
17:35 - javascript
17:37 - course
17:39 - and then here
17:41 - we can update this text
17:52 - learn how to program in javascript
18:02 - okay if i save that go back over
18:08 - looks good
18:10 - okay now i'm going to do the same thing
18:12 - for some of these other ones
18:15 - okay i just finished updating all these
18:19 - other
18:19 - boxes with other videos i've created
18:23 - here's the mernstep course
18:25 - i've got data structures and algorithms
18:27 - in javascript css full course
18:30 - basically i just went through and
18:32 - updated the url here and then copied and
18:35 - used the same url here
18:37 - and then over here i just uploaded
18:39 - updated the image link
18:41 - and then i just added
18:43 - this heading and the paragraph here
18:46 - so that's one great thing about using a
18:49 - template
18:50 - is that it just makes things go a lot
18:52 - quicker instead of writing everything
18:54 - from scratch you can just update things
18:56 - to meet your needs so if we just go over
18:59 - to
19:00 - the
19:01 - page
19:03 - you can see now it says courses from
19:06 - beau carnes always create many popular
19:08 - programming courses now you can access
19:09 - this top courses all in one place click
19:11 - this goes down
19:13 - and then if you click on any of these
19:15 - courses let's say the mern stack one
19:17 - click watch you can watch it right in
19:19 - the browser right here
19:21 - or you can just click this picture here
19:24 - to open the same thing
19:26 - so that's pretty cool let's see if
19:28 - there's anything else you want to change
19:30 - so your stuff down here
19:31 - and i'll go back over to the
19:34 - code so we have
19:36 - the
19:37 - footer here
19:40 - so that's what you see right here this
19:42 - whole section is the footer section
19:46 - so not only is there a tag called footer
19:48 - and then we have the closing tag down
19:50 - here we also have the id of footer
19:53 - so a lot of things in html just dividing
19:55 - up things into sections so we have the
19:57 - footer section and then a div can
19:59 - basically be any section so what we're
20:01 - dividing up into this intersection which
20:05 - we can style with the css
20:08 - so when you have a template you can
20:09 - either update the text to be what you
20:11 - want or if you don't want that section
20:13 - you just can delete it
20:15 - i'm just going to delete these two
20:17 - sections so if i go over here and
20:20 - refresh now it's just going to have the
20:22 - social media links at the end
20:24 - again i don't want all of the social
20:26 - media links
20:27 - you can see
20:28 - the social media links are in a
20:31 - list so ul means unordered list
20:35 - and it has the class of icons
20:38 - and so we have four list elements li the
20:42 - list elements in the list you can see
20:43 - there's the opening tag and then at the
20:45 - end there's going to be the closing tag
20:47 - here and same with the ul and the
20:49 - closing ul list and you see these are
20:52 - just a link that you click on and you
20:54 - can see the class of the
20:57 - fa twitter f8s facebook fa
21:00 - instagram this class
21:02 - here is how the is where the image is
21:05 - coming from this is something fa stands
21:07 - for font awesome and it's something that
21:10 - you can
21:11 - put into your website so you can use
21:13 - different classes to make a specific
21:16 - image pop up there and i'll show you
21:18 - when i go to talk about the css file how
21:21 - this is how this works how we get
21:23 - awesome into our website so it works
21:26 - so i'm going i only want to have the
21:29 - twitter and the email so i'm going to
21:30 - delete these two lines the facebook and
21:34 - the instagram one
21:36 - and then i have to make these links work
21:38 - right now
21:39 - see the href this is where the url that
21:42 - we're linking to and if it's just this
21:45 - pound sign here that means it's just a
21:47 - it links to itself so when you click the
21:49 - link it does nothing but i want it to do
21:51 - something so i'm just going to put hd
21:53 - best colon slash twitter.com
21:59 - and then i'll go into this one and do
22:03 - a mailto
22:05 - bow
22:06 - at free code camp.org
22:09 - so you can either put a full url to go
22:12 - to or if you put the
22:14 - word mail to colon and you put an email
22:16 - address it will open up if you click
22:18 - that link it will open up sending an
22:20 - email to that person so let's save it
22:22 - and go back over to the page
22:24 - and refresh
22:26 - so if i click the twitter icon
22:29 - yup it opens up my twitter
22:31 - and then if i click the
22:33 - mail icon it will open up sending a new
22:35 - email to me okay let's make some more
22:38 - changes by updating the css file but
22:41 - first i'll talk about these scripts
22:43 - so most of these are common javascript
22:45 - libraries which is just javascript code
22:47 - that someone else wrote that you can use
22:50 - on your page to add extra functionality
22:53 - so that we have jquery
22:55 - jquery.scrollingjquery.poptrox
22:58 - and that's going to add different
22:59 - functionality on the page
23:01 - and then
23:02 - the main the code the custom code is
23:05 - toward the end we have the util.js and
23:08 - the main.js
23:10 - and we can look at that right in the
23:12 - page here
23:15 - so here's our
23:16 - utility one and here's our main one
23:20 - and we're not going to talk a lot about
23:23 - the javascript in this video but
23:25 - basically the javascript helps make it
23:28 - work where when you click this it
23:30 - scrolls down like that that's javascript
23:32 - when you click this it pops up it fades
23:35 - in the background and pops up that
23:36 - window that's javascript doing that so
23:39 - javascript can just add some extra
23:42 - functionality to your page and that's
23:43 - what's happening here
23:46 - okay let's go to the css file the
23:50 - main.css file
23:52 - so you can import
23:54 - just like how in your html file you can
23:57 - import
23:58 - cs the css you're going to use in your
24:00 - html you can import other css to use in
24:05 - your css file so we can see import
24:09 - font
24:09 - awesome.min.css
24:11 - now it's getting that right from you can
24:13 - see right here in our assets
24:16 - awesome.min.css so that's what this is
24:18 - and it's importing that css so we can
24:21 - use that also and then it's also going
24:24 - to import and then it's this url so here
24:26 - it's importing a file but here it's
24:28 - actually just importing a url
24:30 - so this url that's being imported you
24:34 - can see it says fonts it says google
24:36 - this is google fonts google has made
24:39 - available a bunch of different fonts
24:42 - that people can easily use on their
24:44 - websites by
24:46 - importing the font through google fonts
24:48 - and you can see it's
24:50 - the font source stands pro at the weight
24:53 - 300 400 and then we have this passion
24:57 - one font at the weight 400. now i want
25:01 - to show you something here where it says
25:04 - awesome.min.css if you looked when it
25:06 - opened the awesome file this css file
25:09 - looks very different than the other
25:11 - main.css file we were looking at because
25:14 - this has been minimized basically it
25:17 - goes through a automated process when
25:20 - you minimize a file goes through an
25:21 - automated process to make it as small as
25:24 - possible and so it takes up less space
25:27 - when someone's trying to download that
25:29 - file it's not as easy to read but it's
25:32 - easier for users to download that file
25:35 - and it still works just like any other
25:36 - css file
25:38 - so if we go if we look at this basic css
25:42 - we're just going to like briefly cover
25:44 - this
25:44 - but it starts with a reset
25:47 - so this is something that people often
25:49 - will include in their css to make sure
25:52 - all different browsers look kind of
25:54 - similar so you know there's a lot of
25:56 - different browsers that people can be
25:57 - using to access your website there's
26:00 - certain uh
26:02 - css properties and code you can put in
26:05 - that's going to make all browsers
26:08 - look very similar and it's also going to
26:11 - just make things look a little nicer
26:14 - than the default css so that's what we
26:16 - have in this reset
26:18 - so it's just going to always apply this
26:20 - reset
26:21 - and then
26:23 - we're going to the basic this is the
26:25 - stuff that's being added specifically
26:28 - for this website so now we're to the
26:30 - other sections and these other sections
26:32 - are stuff that's specifically for this
26:35 - website to to make it look special to
26:38 - make it look how we want to look so you
26:40 - can see the basic um
26:43 - way that css works is that well let's
26:46 - look at let's look at this as an example
26:48 - so this is the selector this is the
26:50 - property in this the value so we're
26:53 - selecting the body tag we're changing
26:55 - the color to this white color so you can
26:59 - see rgba that's just one way to specify
27:02 - a white that's 0.75 opacity and the font
27:06 - family is going to be source sans pro
27:09 - which remember was imported from google
27:11 - fonts and if that's not available it
27:13 - will just use a sans serif font the font
27:16 - size is going to be 14 points font
27:18 - weighs to be 300 points and the line
27:20 - height is 1.65
27:23 - now with css how it works is
27:26 - whatever is the most specific is what
27:30 - style applies to the element so for
27:32 - instance we see the body here if we go
27:35 - over to the html we can see the body is
27:39 - here so almost everything is inside this
27:42 - body but if we styled say
27:46 - the inner class and we had styles that
27:49 - specifically reference this inner class
27:52 - that's going to override anything that
27:54 - applies to the body
27:56 - so
27:58 - a lot of these styles here are never
28:01 - going to be used if there's something
28:03 - more specific so let's scroll down to
28:05 - some of the other things that are being
28:07 - styled
28:10 - okay let's look at this we have h1
28:15 - 8 h2h3h4h5h6 these are the headings so
28:18 - the color this is another white color
28:20 - there's a lot of ways to specify the
28:22 - color and this is one of them font
28:24 - weight line height and the margin so if
28:28 - we change this color to something
28:30 - different we'll probably be able to see
28:32 - it right on our page so instead of
28:35 - putting a hex value or something i'm
28:37 - just going to type in the word green
28:39 - that's another way you can specify
28:41 - colors in css now go right over here if
28:44 - i refresh we should see something turn
28:47 - to green
28:48 - and you can see these words have not now
28:51 - all turned to green
28:53 - so
28:54 - let's go back and make this white again
28:58 - so another thing i want to show you is
29:00 - this whole section right here where it
29:03 - says media and screen max width 1680
29:07 - pixels median screen max with 1280
29:10 - pixels and then you see 980 pixels 736
29:14 - pixels 480 pixels
29:16 - this is how to make
29:19 - your web page responsive
29:21 - so
29:22 - the it's
29:24 - so this css is going to specify
29:26 - a different style depending on how wide
29:31 - the screen is
29:33 - okay to see how these media queries work
29:35 - let's look at this other code this is
29:38 - for
29:39 - the thumbnails and the box
29:41 - so in the css we're selecting the
29:44 - thumbnails class and then we're
29:46 - selecting the box class that's inside
29:49 - the thumbnails class so if we go back
29:52 - over here
29:53 - we have
29:54 - the thumbnails class classical
29:56 - thumbnails and then we have the box
29:59 - class that's inside the thumbnails class
30:02 - so this is going to impact everything
30:06 - that's inside the box class which is
30:10 - this code right here
30:12 - so this code is going to change and you
30:15 - can see it's going to change depending
30:17 - on the width of the screen
30:19 - it's going to either be
30:20 - the width of 30 percent 45 percent or
30:24 - 100 percent
30:25 - so if we go back over to our page
30:28 - and then if i change
30:30 - the size you can see
30:33 - these boxes that show the thumbnails
30:35 - they're changing depending on how wide
30:38 - my
30:39 - browser is so if it's really narrow it
30:41 - just shows one the column then it goes
30:43 - up to two then it goes up to three and
30:46 - that's all from these media queries
30:49 - they're changing them this is changing
30:51 - the width depending on the size of the
30:54 - screen
30:56 - okay well let's
30:58 - make this bigger again and let's look at
30:59 - the things we want to change so when
31:02 - you're changing something based on a
31:04 - template
31:05 - you want to just try to find something
31:07 - you want to change and then try to
31:08 - figure out how to change it so i want to
31:10 - change this
31:11 - dark color around here i want this to be
31:14 - a different color so i have to figure
31:17 - out which css is is selecting this dark
31:20 - element around here
31:21 - so one way you can do it is just through
31:23 - trial and error trying to figure out
31:25 - what you need to change to change this
31:27 - background color so if i go back to my
31:30 - code i'm going to just search i do
31:32 - command f or control f and i'm going to
31:35 - search for background
31:38 - and i can see that this looks very
31:41 - similar to that color so i'm going to
31:42 - try changing this to another one so with
31:45 - this i can type in the name of a color
31:46 - or a hex code or i can just use this
31:49 - color pick here here that's in visual
31:51 - studio code so i want to make more of a
31:53 - greener color
31:55 - and now i'm going to save this i'll go
31:58 - back to my page i'll refresh
32:01 - and now
32:02 - it worked
32:03 - so i chose the right thing
32:06 - you know i think i want that maybe to be
32:08 - a little more of a dark green well
32:10 - that's easy i can go back over here
32:13 - and then i can
32:14 - make this a little darker
32:17 - and save it and then i refresh
32:22 - okay oh that looks nice now since this
32:25 - is green i kind of want this text or
32:28 - maybe some green to appear right up here
32:30 - somewhere or how about this maybe this
32:32 - circle let's see if i can get this
32:34 - circle to be green so one way to try to
32:37 - figure out what you need to change is to
32:39 - right click on something and then go to
32:41 - inspect element
32:43 - so this is bringing up the element in
32:45 - the html just in the inspector on the
32:48 - browser
32:49 - and so it looks like this could be the
32:51 - the right one and i can actually test it
32:53 - by changing the css right in here so i'm
32:58 - actually going to try changing this
33:00 - right here to instead of
33:02 - white let's see if i change the screen
33:04 - if that will
33:06 - change anything
33:07 - and did so you can see right on the page
33:09 - as i change it in the inspector it
33:12 - changes it
33:13 - on here so i so now i know that i'm
33:17 - looking for something that's styling
33:20 - this banner more see how it says banner
33:23 - more this is the selector that i'm
33:25 - looking for in my css
33:27 - so if i go back over to here and i just
33:30 - had just copied it over in my browser
33:33 - i'm going to find and then paste banner
33:35 - more so now i can change this border if
33:38 - i want to change that circle well how
33:40 - about this i'm going to make this bigger
33:42 - and i'm going to
33:45 - change this to a green color so we'll
33:48 - kind of match the other green that i
33:50 - have going
33:52 - now since this is just an example
33:55 - i'm not going to be like super exact but
33:57 - i could try to make it the exact same
33:59 - green or i could look at a color wheel
34:01 - to try to figure out what's the
34:03 - complementary color to the the different
34:05 - colors but for now i'll just choose that
34:07 - green and i'll go back over if i refresh
34:11 - now
34:13 - circle well you know maybe i will try to
34:15 - get the exact green because i wonder if
34:18 - it would match how that would look so
34:20 - let me go back over here i'm going to go
34:22 - back up to my body
34:24 - where i did my initial green
34:28 - here we go
34:30 - and now i will do my search again to
34:32 - come back down to here
34:34 - and i'm going to just
34:36 - add this new color
34:39 - and then go back over if i refresh
34:46 - okay nice
34:49 - one thing is see when you hover over it
34:51 - it gets white i want it to be a maybe a
34:54 - lighter green so let me go back over
34:56 - here
34:57 - and let me try to find the hover section
34:59 - so here you can see um well let me so
35:02 - where it says banner more and we change
35:05 - it to the border to be green well here's
35:08 - banner more hover
35:10 - that's what the style is going to be
35:13 - when someone's hovering their mouse over
35:15 - it now like nor we'll just keep all the
35:18 - same style as the original one but it
35:21 - will add these changes
35:23 - so i'm gonna change this border well i
35:26 - want i still want to be a two pixel when
35:28 - you're hovering over
35:29 - and now i want to change the color i'm
35:32 - going to change this to a lighter green
35:35 - and maybe add some more blue into it
35:38 - and let's see what that looks like i'll
35:39 - save that go back over
35:44 - and that didn't seem to
35:46 - well i guess it did change it oh yeah
35:50 - now it gets lighter green that's kind of
35:51 - nice
35:56 - yeah i like that
35:59 - so now when i click this it goes down
36:05 - so we can do the same thing by changing
36:08 - different fonts different colors
36:11 - just trying to figure out which css
36:13 - needs to change to change something
36:17 - okay the final thing i want to do is
36:18 - change the text color here
36:22 - so i'm going to go to inspect element
36:25 - and
36:26 - we can see oh it's
36:28 - color white banner h1 now let's just
36:32 - check make sure this is the right one so
36:33 - if i change this if i just type in blue
36:36 - yeah it changes to blue
36:39 - so
36:40 - let's change this to a green color i'm
36:42 - going to just copy this here
36:45 - the the css selector and then i'll just
36:48 - search for the css selector here
36:51 - and here it is so now instead of being
36:54 - white
36:59 - i'm going to change this to a green
37:01 - color again but this is going to be a
37:04 - lighter green than before so let's see
37:06 - what that looks like
37:13 - okay you know what i want to be the
37:15 - exact color that this circle
37:18 - becomes when you hover over it to get
37:20 - that color i can either go back into the
37:22 - css file or i can just
37:24 - inspect this element again
37:26 - and
37:28 - let's see i can turn on the hover state
37:32 - by
37:33 - clicking the hover here now i can get
37:35 - the color from right here
37:38 - and it's just going to copy this color
37:40 - here
37:43 - and i'll go back over here
37:49 - okay so now i'm just going to paste in
37:52 - the color here
37:56 - and i'll save that i'll go back over
37:58 - i'll
37:59 - and i'll refresh
38:04 - okay that's going to be it for now i
38:06 - know this design could be a little
38:07 - better but i'm going to count this good
38:09 - for now because i want to get on to the
38:11 - next part of this course which is
38:12 - purchasing a domain name
38:15 - so let me make sure everything's saved
38:17 - yep all my files are saved because i'm
38:20 - going to copy these files over
38:23 - actually let me quickly delete these
38:24 - because i'm not going to need any of
38:26 - these pictures
38:27 - because i'm not using those same
38:28 - pictures
38:29 - but we'll i'll just keep everything else
38:32 - here and we're going to be copying these
38:34 - files over to our hosting provider once
38:36 - we get that but right now we're going to
38:38 - get a domain name
38:45 - so now you have the files for your
38:46 - website or you're going to install
38:48 - wordpress
38:50 - now i'll show you how to get a custom
38:51 - domain
38:53 - this is what people type into the
38:54 - address bar on their web browser to
38:56 - access your website
38:58 - some examples are youtube.com
39:01 - freecodcamp.org or ces.tech
39:04 - these are all custom domains the end of
39:07 - the website name such as dot com dot org
39:10 - or dot net is called the top level
39:12 - domain or sometimes people just call it
39:14 - the domain ending
39:16 - while dot com is by far the most popular
39:19 - domain ending
39:20 - there are actually hundreds of other
39:22 - endings
39:23 - take a look at all of these on the
39:25 - screen right now
39:27 - one ending that is increasingly popular
39:29 - for people in the tech industry is dot
39:32 - tech and this video was made possible
39:34 - through a grant by the company who runs
39:36 - the dot tech domain when you are
39:38 - deciding what you want your domain to be
39:40 - you also have to decide what domain
39:42 - ending you want
39:44 - here are a few reasons you may want to
39:46 - consider less common domain ending
39:48 - more availability the less common
39:51 - endings have not been around as long so
39:53 - there are way more of them still
39:55 - available
39:56 - it's very hard to find a dot-com name
39:58 - that has not already been taken
40:00 - unique
40:01 - these newer domain endings may help you
40:04 - stand out as being unique which can also
40:07 - help create more of a lasting impression
40:10 - seo using a new domain ending won't hurt
40:13 - your search presence or seo it's worth
40:16 - noting that in the eyes of google and
40:17 - other search engines all tlds or these
40:21 - domain endings are equal so if you get a
40:24 - highly searched for name in your url it
40:27 - can be helpful for seo
40:29 - there are a bunch of places where you
40:31 - can buy domain name and they all work
40:33 - almost exactly the same here are some
40:35 - options
40:36 - godaddy.com
40:38 - domains.google
40:40 - namecheap.com
40:42 - get.tech
40:43 - i'm going to demonstrate how to purchase
40:45 - a domain name on git dot tech since
40:48 - we're getting a dot tech domain
40:50 - but just know the process is similar no
40:52 - matter where you buy your domain name
40:54 - here it makes it really easy you just
40:56 - type in the domain you want so i'm going
40:59 - to try bow.tech
41:05 - okay bodetech is unavailable
41:07 - now most likely the first domain you try
41:09 - is going to be unavailable so it gives
41:11 - some other examples
41:13 - but the other examples are almost never
41:14 - what you're looking for so it's good to
41:16 - have the other options in mind
41:19 - since this website is all about teaching
41:21 - tech i'm going to try both teachers.tech
41:25 - okay it's available
41:27 - and i can buy for one year so i'll
41:29 - choose that
41:31 - i'm not going to show you the whole
41:32 - purchase process but i do want to point
41:34 - out that this privacy protection
41:37 - it says recommended and i would also
41:39 - recommend this
41:41 - if you don't have privacy protection on
41:42 - your domain name then the records of
41:44 - your name and address will be out there
41:46 - for anybody to see your name your
41:48 - address your email address so if you
41:50 - don't get privacy protection you're
41:52 - going to start getting spam because
41:54 - there's companies out there that are
41:55 - constantly checking for all new domains
41:58 - registered to see if there's any real
42:00 - addresses or email addresses
42:02 - and then they're gonna start sending you
42:04 - stuff to advertise because they think
42:06 - you'll be interested in buying things
42:08 - for your new domain so definitely get
42:10 - privacy protection
42:13 - okay i'm just gonna place this order
42:16 - now we're finished buying the domain
42:19 - and to edit the domain we'll just go
42:20 - into manage orders and then find the
42:23 - order that i did for bo teaches.tech
42:30 - and this is our control panel
42:33 - i'll get that a little bigger
42:34 - and then we can update things in this
42:36 - control panel to make our website work
42:39 - but before we can update anything in
42:40 - this control panel we have to get
42:42 - hosting
42:49 - so now that you have your domain name
42:51 - you have to store your file somewhere
42:53 - when you go to any website on the
42:55 - internet your browser has to download
42:57 - the files for that website from a
42:59 - physical location somewhere else in the
43:01 - world
43:02 - a company that stores website files so
43:04 - that they are always available when
43:06 - someone goes to the url is called a
43:08 - hosting provider
43:10 - there are many hosting providers out
43:11 - there that will host files for your
43:13 - website
43:14 - some places will even host your website
43:16 - for free
43:17 - in this section i'll mainly be talking
43:19 - about hosting a static website or a
43:21 - wordpress site
43:23 - if you have a dynamic web application
43:25 - that has to run server-side code before
43:27 - sending web pages to the client then the
43:29 - setup will be a little more complicated
43:31 - than what i described here
43:34 - first i'll talk about how to get things
43:36 - set up on most paid hosting providers
43:39 - and then i'll show you how you can host
43:40 - your website for free on github pages
43:44 - here are some of the common hosting
43:46 - providers for web pages
43:48 - bluehost hostgator hostinger
43:51 - godaddy dreamhost
43:53 - almost all hosting providers have
43:55 - something in common which is this
43:57 - users manage the hosting service through
43:59 - a web application called cpanel or
44:02 - something very similar to cpanel
44:05 - so if you learn the basics of cpanel
44:07 - then it will be simple to use any
44:08 - hosting provider
44:11 - so all the hosting providers are very
44:13 - similar so matter which one you sign up
44:15 - for the steps should be basically the
44:17 - same
44:18 - first of all i would recommend just
44:20 - picking the cheapest possible hosting
44:23 - plan
44:24 - whatever hosting provider you use just
44:26 - pick the cheapest plan you can always
44:28 - upgrade later if you need to
44:31 - often the cheapest plan will work and
44:33 - you can always upgrade later if you
44:35 - somehow need more space or need more
44:37 - bandwidth
44:38 - make sure you choose that you already
44:39 - own this domain because you we've
44:41 - already purchased the domain
44:44 - and the rest of this is pretty
44:46 - straightforward
44:48 - okay i got my hosting and now i'm just
44:51 - going to launch the cpanel
44:53 - the exact way to get into cpanel could
44:55 - be different depending on your hosting
44:58 - provider but it should all be pretty
45:00 - similar and again your hosting provider
45:02 - may not have cpanel but it will
45:04 - definitely have something similar
45:07 - there's no single look for the cpanel
45:09 - dashboard because there are many themes
45:11 - and styles that host can use but the
45:14 - functionality is similar
45:16 - so one of the things you're most likely
45:18 - going to be using is the file manager
45:22 - the two main ways of getting files into
45:24 - your hosting provider is the file
45:26 - manager
45:27 - or through an ftp account
45:31 - so let's look at the file manager
45:34 - so the files we see here are the files
45:36 - that the hosting provider just puts
45:38 - there by default
45:40 - we're going to go to the public html
45:43 - section
45:44 - and this is where we're going to add the
45:47 - files
45:48 - so that's one thing you're going to have
45:49 - to look into when you are trying to
45:53 - upload your files to your hosting
45:54 - provider you're going to have to make
45:56 - sure you upload them to the right
45:57 - directory
45:59 - it may not be the root directory it's
46:01 - probably going to be something like this
46:03 - the public html directory
46:05 - and so those are the files that will
46:07 - appear when people go to your website
46:10 - i'm going to delete everything in here
46:12 - because i don't actually need anything
46:14 - in this directory
46:17 - now i'll go to upload
46:19 - and i cannot upload directories but
46:22 - there is a trick to be able to upload
46:24 - everything at once which is to create a
46:27 - zip file
46:28 - so let me select all my files
46:31 - and then i'll just go to compress
46:34 - and it could be different on windows but
46:36 - it's gonna be pretty similar how you're
46:38 - gonna be able to find something to make
46:39 - them into a zip file so i'm just going
46:41 - to upload the zip file
46:43 - so this includes all the assets and all
46:45 - the images and even the background video
46:48 - so it could take a little bit to upload
46:50 - okay i'm going to go back here
46:52 - and i'm going to extract
47:01 - and this is just an extra directory that
47:03 - i can delete
47:06 - okay i have my website uploaded to the
47:08 - hosting provider we still have to
47:10 - connect the hosting provider to the
47:12 - domain name
47:14 - and we'll do that in a little bit
47:16 - for now i'm just going to close this
47:18 - and let's look at some of the other
47:20 - things you can do
47:21 - with cpanel
47:24 - so we could have uploaded the files
47:26 - through
47:26 - ftp
47:28 - here we can create an ftp account
47:31 - if you have an ftp client like filezilla
47:34 - you can ftp into this and you can easily
47:36 - upload files
47:38 - another thing we can do is create a
47:40 - subdomain let's say we create one called
47:42 - blog
47:43 - so now it's going to be
47:44 - blog.teachers.tech
47:49 - the way i get files into that subdomain
47:53 - is
47:55 - it should show up right in my file
47:57 - manager so if i go back into the file
48:00 - manager now you can see there's a new
48:02 - folder it's called blog.bowteaches.tech
48:06 - anything i put into this folder will now
48:09 - appear at the subdomain once i connect
48:12 - my hosting to the domain name
48:15 - so the two other things i want to show
48:16 - you are the email accounts and the
48:18 - wordpress installer
48:21 - there are a bunch of other things on
48:22 - here that you can mess around and
48:23 - continue learning but i'm just going to
48:25 - cover these other two for now
48:28 - so right here you can create an email
48:30 - account we can also create an email
48:32 - account on the dot tech admin page which
48:35 - i'll show you that in a second again
48:37 - later let's say we want bo at
48:39 - bowteaches.tech
48:42 - and we create a password
48:44 - and then create account
48:49 - okay i can set up the mail client
48:52 - now this is just going to give you
48:54 - different ways to set up the client
48:56 - depending on which method you want to
48:58 - use
48:59 - i'm not going to go through every one
49:01 - but depending on what you want to do you
49:02 - just set it up differently
49:05 - okay the final thing is the wordpress
49:06 - installer so i was saying it's very
49:09 - simple to install wordpress once you
49:11 - have your hosting just click on
49:13 - wordpress installer and then click on
49:15 - install now
49:17 - and then that's pretty much it once you
49:20 - install wordpress you can now use
49:23 - wordpress right on your site
49:25 - and you can watch any wordpress tutorial
49:28 - to learn how to use wordpress i'm not
49:30 - going to install wordpress right now
49:32 - because i'm going to use the other files
49:34 - that i already uploaded onto there so
49:37 - what i'm going to do now is just go back
49:38 - to the dashboard
49:43 - and now i'm going to connect the hosting
49:44 - provider to the domain name
49:47 - and to do that we're going to scroll
49:50 - down until you see the name servers
49:54 - now no matter what company you use to
49:56 - create your domain name
49:58 - and no matter what hosting provider you
50:00 - use
50:01 - you're almost always going to connect
50:03 - these two together with these name
50:05 - servers
50:06 - so i'm going to copy this name server
50:08 - and then go back over to the control
50:11 - panel for the dot tech domain
50:14 - and then you can see there's a name
50:17 - servers
50:18 - manage name servers that use this domain
50:20 - name so i'll click that
50:23 - and then i'm just going to paste in the
50:25 - first name server and then i'll get the
50:27 - second name server
50:30 - and then i'll paste in the second name
50:33 - server
50:35 - we'll put it here
50:37 - and you don't really need to have every
50:38 - name server filled in so i'm just going
50:40 - to go through and delete these other two
50:43 - and then update name servers
50:48 - now
50:49 - everything really should be set up for
50:51 - my website to work
50:53 - sometimes it can take up to 24 hours for
50:56 - everything to update
50:58 - so you may have to wait up to 24 hours
51:01 - before you can actually see your website
51:03 - live
51:05 - okay i waited some time and
51:08 - the name servers have been able to
51:10 - propagate throughout the internet and
51:12 - now the website works
51:14 - so i go to bowteachers.tech
51:16 - and it loads
51:19 - so you can see this if i click here it
51:21 - should open up
51:23 - yep it opens up a video to watch here
51:27 - okay everything's working i can now
51:30 - access my website at a custom domain
51:38 - once you know how it's actually pretty
51:40 - simple to set up a website to host for
51:42 - free at github pages
51:45 - the first step is to create a github
51:47 - account and log into your account
51:51 - and then you just need to create a new
51:53 - repository
51:55 - the name of the repository is very
51:58 - important
52:00 - so for the name of the repository you
52:02 - have to type in your username your
52:04 - github account name
52:06 - and then you just type in
52:08 - github.io
52:10 - bo
52:12 - fcc.github.io
52:13 - this is going to create a repository
52:16 - that will be a special type of
52:18 - repository that will be able to host our
52:20 - website on github pages
52:23 - okay now i'm just going to create a
52:25 - repository
52:28 - okay now that we create the repository
52:31 - we can you can either
52:32 - upload your files using the command line
52:36 - or you can do it right through the web
52:38 - interface so i'll just click upload an
52:40 - existing file
52:44 - and i'm just going to drag and drop the
52:45 - files
52:46 - so let me grab these files here
52:49 - and just bring it over here
52:52 - now it's just going to upload all the
52:53 - files for our website
53:00 - okay all the files are
53:03 - uploaded and i'll just do commit changes
53:06 - after the files are done processing
53:09 - i can go to this url just copy it right
53:11 - here
53:13 - and i'll open up a new tab i'll paste in
53:15 - the url
53:16 - and
53:18 - that did not work
53:22 - okay it takes a few minutes for the
53:24 - updates to show up so if we just wait a
53:26 - little bit and then try refreshing it
53:28 - should work
53:30 - it can take up to 20 minutes for the
53:32 - changes you create on github to show up
53:35 - on the github pages but it's now loading
53:38 - you can see in the address bar
53:40 - bofcc.github
53:42 - and we can see our page
53:45 - now we just need to make this show up at
53:48 - bowteachers.tech
53:50 - before i make this show up at our custom
53:53 - url let me show you how easy it is to
53:55 - make changes to the page
53:58 - on github
53:59 - so you can always change it on your
54:02 - local computer and then upload it again
54:04 - or use the github interface or you can
54:07 - change it right on
54:09 - this github interface you can change the
54:11 - html right on here
54:12 - so in order to edit this i'm going to
54:14 - click the pencil icon for edit this file
54:19 - and then i'm just going to update the
54:22 - title here instead of courses from beau
54:24 - carnes
54:25 - i'm going to call this
54:28 - programming
54:29 - courses from beau carnes
54:32 - and then i can just scroll down to the
54:34 - bottom
54:35 - and you can put a commit message you can
54:38 - put a commit message but i'll just leave
54:39 - this as the default for now
54:42 - and just click commit changes
54:45 - now again it's going to take
54:46 - possibly up to 15 minutes to show up on
54:48 - here
54:49 - but while we're waiting i will show you
54:52 - how to make this
54:54 - work with your custom url
54:56 - and then if we do this right we'll be
54:58 - able to know that we're not getting it
54:59 - from our hosting provider because this
55:01 - will change so here's bo teaches.tech
55:04 - currently
55:05 - and you can see it says courses from
55:07 - beau carnes and this is coming right
55:09 - from our hosting provider that we set up
55:12 - before
55:12 - but now we're switching it to use github
55:15 - pages for the hosting provider so after
55:18 - we update this this will say programming
55:20 - courses from beau carnes to reflect the
55:23 - change that was just made on github so
55:25 - the first step is to go back into github
55:29 - and i'm going to click on settings
55:33 - if i scroll all the way toward the
55:35 - bottom of the settings
55:37 - i can put in a custom domain custom
55:39 - domains allow you to serve your site
55:41 - from a domain other than both
55:43 - fcc.github.io so i'll put
55:46 - bo teaches dot tech
55:50 - and then i'll save it
55:52 - so now that we updated the github
55:54 - settings i'm gonna have to go back to
55:56 - our domain dashboard
55:58 - so this is at the tech control panel or
56:01 - dashboard
56:02 - and to make this work with github pages
56:05 - i'm going to have to go to dns
56:06 - management no matter what company you
56:09 - purchase your domain from there's going
56:11 - to be some way to update the dns
56:13 - settings of your domain so i'm going to
56:15 - manage dns here
56:20 - and i'm going to update some things the
56:21 - first thing i'm going to update is the
56:23 - cname record so the cname is like an
56:27 - alias or it's a way to forward to a
56:30 - different domain
56:31 - so i'm going to
56:34 - add a cname record and for the host name
56:36 - i'll put www so when you go to
56:38 - www.bowties.tech
56:41 - we're going to forward to
56:44 - bofcc.github.io
56:50 - and then i'll just add this record so so
56:52 - now
56:54 - www.bow.teaches.tech will go there i
56:56 - also want to set it up so just bo
56:58 - teaches.tech without the www will also
57:02 - go to the github pages page so to make
57:04 - that work i'm going to add an a record
57:08 - so i will put nothing here
57:10 - and then for this destination address
57:13 - i'm going to put an ip address that
57:14 - comes right from github so it's going to
57:16 - be 185.199.108.15
57:26 - three
57:27 - and then i can click add record
57:33 - okay
57:34 - that should be all set so i'm gonna
57:36 - close this for now
57:38 - so before i updated the name servers to
57:41 - work with the hosting provider
57:44 - but now that i'm using github pages and
57:47 - i updated the dns settings i don't need
57:50 - the name servers i used previously
57:53 - so to make these new dns settings work
57:56 - i'm going to have to
57:58 - default the name servers back to what
58:00 - they were it says right here required to
58:02 - use our dns management service with your
58:05 - domain name so it says we need i need to
58:07 - go back to the default name servers
58:10 - so i'm going to copy this
58:13 - i'll go up
58:14 - to the top here
58:18 - and then i'm going to change this to
58:19 - venus because that was the second one
58:22 - and as long as you have two that should
58:24 - work so i'm going to update the name
58:25 - servers
58:28 - and now anytime you update the name
58:29 - servers you could have to wait up to 24
58:32 - hours so i'm going to have to wait and
58:34 - then i'll i will check the website to
58:36 - see if it updates to use the page github
58:40 - pages instead of the hosting provider we
58:42 - had before
58:44 - so it's been over 24 hours and and check
58:46 - this out i'm at bo teaches.tech and it
58:49 - says programming courses from beau
58:51 - carnes
58:52 - so i'm now loading the page right from
58:55 - github pages
58:57 - and now whenever i want to update the
58:58 - page i just update the files on the
59:01 - github repo and then within 15 minutes
59:04 - or so the changes will reflect right on
59:07 - the actual domain right on the page both
59:10 - teachers.tech
59:11 - so now you know how to set up a website
59:13 - with github pages
59:15 - so now you've learned how to create a
59:16 - simple website get a custom domain
59:19 - and host the website through various
59:22 - methods
59:23 - thanks for watching

url people type in to get to your website host your website which is where the files for your website are stored configure dns settings and set up a custom email address if you are just interested in one of these topics check the description of this video for links to the individual sections let's get started you may already have files for your website that you want to put onto the internet in that case skip to this time shown on the screen right now or just go to the next section in the progress bar of this video in this section i'm going to go over how to create a website i assume you already know what your website is going to be about two common ways to create a website are to create it using html css and javascript or you can use a content management system like wordpress wordpress allows you to create a website without knowing how to code the simplest way to create a wordpress website is to get your hosting first so in the section of this video about hosting i'll show you how to install wordpress right now though i'll show you how to create a site using html css and javascript for this example i'm going to create a landing page for different programming courses i've developed this will be a simple site based on a template just to get you started if you want to learn how to make more complex sites check out the playlist linked to in the description html css and javascript are all just text stored in text files html describes the structure of your website and css describes the style and how it looks javascript adds additional interactivity and functionality while you can create these files in any text editor it's common to use a source code editor such as visual studio code this makes it easier to write html and css and even javascript or other programming languages so first let's download visual studio code so if we just go to the main website and download from mac or whatever operating system you have i won't show the whole installation process because well i already have installed and it's different for each operating system so let's go right over to visual studio code okay we have visual studio code and now we can create the website so this is what it looks like when you first start up visual studio code we could just click new file and create the new html file in the new css file but we're going to do something a little different if you're just starting out it can sometimes be helpful to start with a website template this just means starter code for your website that you can customize for your needs this can be an excellent way to learn you can see html and css that someone else has created and then you can start to understand how it works together there are a bunch of sites offering templates one of them is templated.co there are a bunch of templates to choose from i'm going to choose this one called full motion because it includes a responsive video gallery and my page is supposed to help people watch video courses i've created so i'll just click download here but you can download the other ones if one of the other ones meets your needs a little better so after it's downloaded and unzipped i can just go to visual studio code click open folder and then i'll navigate to the folder and click open and now we can see everything on the side here this is the file browser i can just close this welcome screen i don't need that anymore i'm going to open up the index.html now when you're creating a website the main file is almost always called index.html so that's the thing that you're going to want to edit we're going to be modifying the html file in css file you don't need to know everything to modify a template but you should know the basics of how html and css are structured i'm just going to give you a very brief overview if you want to learn more about html and css check the links in the description so you can see this is an example of a paragraph tag that's what the p stands for paragraph and every html tag is going to have an opening tag which is this section right here and a closing tag which is this final section right here and in between the tags in between the the opening paragraph tag and the closing paragraph tag is where text would normally be the text in here would be the paragraph and this opening tag and then closing tag designates the beginning of the paragraph and the ending of the paragraph and you can see in the opening tag there's an id this id is an attribute and the attribute of id is set to my id now the id is often used to identify a certain tag or a certain section of your website for use in the css and the javascript so inside an opening tag there can be all sorts of different attributes and you'll see some other examples when i go to the other code so let's look at this diagram this shows how an html page is structured you can see there's branching sections almost like a tree it's a tree structure so we have our overall document and then we have our root element which is the html element so you'll have an htm an opening html tag and a closing html tag and then everything will be inside that tag so you'll have a head section a opening head tag and a closing head tag and inside the head section there'll be a title with some text and then there'll be a body section with a opening body tag and a closing body tag and then within the body there's going to be the different components that are going to make up the body of the website everything nests inside other elements you'll see more of what i mean once we get to the code also you're going to need to know about css so css is used to style the html so in this case we have the body selector so this first board is the selector and this is going to style everything within the body html tag and in this case it's going to set the color to this hex value so css is always going to have a selector the most common things to select are tags like a body tag or an id or a class you can add a specific class any html tag and then you can style in the html section that has that class i'll show you some examples when we get to the actual code so let's go to the code so every html file is going to start with this this is just saying that this is an html file so here you can see the html tag and at the very end we have the closing html tag and you can see there's a line here that connects in everything is indented so within this html tag there is a head section you can see the opening head tag and the closing head tag and within the head section we have a title section and we have these metas and then we have a link here so you can see that within the heading of the page the main thing we have is the title right now it's called full motion so let's change that i'm going to change that to courses from beau carnes so this title will show up at the very top of the browser window often in the tabs if you have it open up to a specific tab that's where this title will show up so we have these meta tags which i'm just going to skip over for now because they're not super important to what i'm talking about now but this next line is important this is how the html file is linked to the css file so you can see that this is href the reference of the css file is this is this thing here assets css slash main.css so let's go over to this in the file browser under assets css and then main.css that's this file right here so this line is connecting our html file to the css file now let's look at this next section this body section oh yeah you can see some of this is grayed out that's because this is a comment so comments can be used to put something in your html file that's not going to appear on your final page or it's not going to be read by the browser so this section this whole next section you can see the body tag starts here and goes all the way down to here the rest of the page is basically the body or what's going to be shown in the browser when someone goes to your website it starts with this top section and this top section has an id of banner and this it says data dash video equals images banner these things can be both referenced from the css and from the javascript and it's going to use javascript to play a video in the top banner actually let's look at that right now let's go over to the website this is what the website looks like you can see it has the title the page here this is not the same title that we just changed the name of we're going to change that in a second you can see this video plays in the background and if you scroll down well you don't even need to scroll down if you click this button it scrolls down automatically and you can see these different boxes here and if we click watch it will open up and it will have a youtube video so we're going to update this so it goes to my youtube videos if we just scroll down we can see the rest of what the page started out as if you look at this text it's not english this is latin it's common to use latin text or lorem ipsum text as placeholder text on templates and any websites where you don't know what the text is going to be yet but we'll be updating that as we update the template so let's go back over here one very common tag in html is a div tag and that just means a divider or some special section that you're going to style in a specific way with the css you can see this has a class of inner and the css is going to be used to style anything that has a class of inner in a special way so let's go into this header section right here i'm going to change this to courses from beau carnes and this time if i save this and i go back to the page i'm going to refresh and i'll go to the top and you can see courses from beau carnes so this is what i'm talking about you can change a template and it's a lot easier than just writing everything from scratch let's go back to our code you can see this is an h1 tag that means heading one or the top heading there's also h2 h3 as4 there's just different levels of heading and here's a paragraph tag i'll close this so we can see more of it here and so this is the opening paragraph tag if we go over we can see the closing paragraph tag and i'm going to update this whole paragraph between the opening tag and the ending tag with an all new paragraph i'm just going to paste it in and so now it refers to what this new page is going to be about so i'll just save that and go back to the page and refresh and you can see it now has the new paragraph here okay let's go back to the code we can change this learn more or we can change it to something else now you can see this is an a tag or an anchor tag that's a link now you can use it to link to another page or you can link to another part of the same page so here you could add a link to another page like i could put free codecamp.org here and then when you clicked on it it would open up freecodcamp.org but since it says this half shine or pound sign main it's going to make it so it goes directly to the main section here which is right here it's going to a dividing section or a div that has an id of main so that's another way the ids are used so you can actually go to specific sections on your page so when you click learn more it's going to scroll down to this section here you can see that we have this div which divides this section of the page that's the main section that we scroll to and then we have another class called enter so this is probably something that's going to be used in the css file to style a specific section of the page and then we have another section called thumbnails so one thing that's kind of nice with visual studio code and with any code editor is these lines that come under a tag this will show where the ending tag is so this is the beginning tag if you click on it you can see this line is a little lighter so if we go all the way down it goes to here so here's the end of the tag here and so that's going to show this whole section this whole um this whole thumbnail section so the thumbnail section starts here and it goes to here where the closing div tag is so in this thumbnail section you can see there's a bunch of box sections so this is one whole box section right here but there's another box section here and then there's another box section here so there's a box for each thumbnail that's right in the page here so here this is what we're going to change one thing you can see here is that it's getting it's linking to a youtube video right here so the a href this is the anchor tag or what you're linking to and the link is surrounding an image so when it says img that's an image src is source and the source is this section right here the images slash pic01.jpg so if we actually go over to here in the file browser we should be able to find that oh here it is the pic001 so you can see that that's the same thing that you see right here so that's what we're going to have to recreate with my own videos you can also change the title so we see the h3 now h1 is a main heading h3 is like a level three heading so you can level one heading level two heading level three heading and we have a paragraph here so let's update this with one of my videos so i'm just gonna go and grab it from youtube here so just go to youtube.com and i'll actually go right to youtube.com freecodecamp i'm just going to get this javascript one this is the my most popular video that i've created so i'll do copy link address and i can go back over here and we'll paste this in here so now oh i just have to delete the time at the end and now we are going to get the image here now i could find the image and then put it right into this directory here and then then link to that image but i'm going to try a different method there's actually a url a direct url to each youtube thumbnail so i can put a actual file name here or i can put a url so i'm going to put a ur url here now it says there's actually a section to update with the video id so i just have to get the video id from right here i'm going to copy it and then i'm going to go over here and i will paste it now if i save this and then i go back to my website now i'm gonna refresh it okay so now we have the javascript in three hours here and if i click here hmm i was expecting the video to pop up so let's go back and troubleshoot because that's just a little black square okay i noticed that these ones have the short url and then i use the long url here so i'm just going to copy this little section and then put into here so we're using the short youtube url instead the long url so let me save that and i'm going to refresh okay and now the youtube video pops up and if i play yep it works so now i'm going to go back here and i have to update the rest of the stuff so this url i'm going to update for the button so this first link is just the image and now there's the button here so we need the link for the button and i can update the title javascript full javascript course and then here we can update this text learn how to program in javascript okay if i save that go back over looks good okay now i'm going to do the same thing for some of these other ones okay i just finished updating all these other boxes with other videos i've created here's the mernstep course i've got data structures and algorithms in javascript css full course basically i just went through and updated the url here and then copied and used the same url here and then over here i just uploaded updated the image link and then i just added this heading and the paragraph here so that's one great thing about using a template is that it just makes things go a lot quicker instead of writing everything from scratch you can just update things to meet your needs so if we just go over to the page you can see now it says courses from beau carnes always create many popular programming courses now you can access this top courses all in one place click this goes down and then if you click on any of these courses let's say the mern stack one click watch you can watch it right in the browser right here or you can just click this picture here to open the same thing so that's pretty cool let's see if there's anything else you want to change so your stuff down here and i'll go back over to the code so we have the footer here so that's what you see right here this whole section is the footer section so not only is there a tag called footer and then we have the closing tag down here we also have the id of footer so a lot of things in html just dividing up things into sections so we have the footer section and then a div can basically be any section so what we're dividing up into this intersection which we can style with the css so when you have a template you can either update the text to be what you want or if you don't want that section you just can delete it i'm just going to delete these two sections so if i go over here and refresh now it's just going to have the social media links at the end again i don't want all of the social media links you can see the social media links are in a list so ul means unordered list and it has the class of icons and so we have four list elements li the list elements in the list you can see there's the opening tag and then at the end there's going to be the closing tag here and same with the ul and the closing ul list and you see these are just a link that you click on and you can see the class of the fa twitter f8s facebook fa instagram this class here is how the is where the image is coming from this is something fa stands for font awesome and it's something that you can put into your website so you can use different classes to make a specific image pop up there and i'll show you when i go to talk about the css file how this is how this works how we get awesome into our website so it works so i'm going i only want to have the twitter and the email so i'm going to delete these two lines the facebook and the instagram one and then i have to make these links work right now see the href this is where the url that we're linking to and if it's just this pound sign here that means it's just a it links to itself so when you click the link it does nothing but i want it to do something so i'm just going to put hd best colon slash twitter.com and then i'll go into this one and do a mailto bow at free code camp.org so you can either put a full url to go to or if you put the word mail to colon and you put an email address it will open up if you click that link it will open up sending an email to that person so let's save it and go back over to the page and refresh so if i click the twitter icon yup it opens up my twitter and then if i click the mail icon it will open up sending a new email to me okay let's make some more changes by updating the css file but first i'll talk about these scripts so most of these are common javascript libraries which is just javascript code that someone else wrote that you can use on your page to add extra functionality so that we have jquery jquery.scrollingjquery.poptrox and that's going to add different functionality on the page and then the main the code the custom code is toward the end we have the util.js and the main.js and we can look at that right in the page here so here's our utility one and here's our main one and we're not going to talk a lot about the javascript in this video but basically the javascript helps make it work where when you click this it scrolls down like that that's javascript when you click this it pops up it fades in the background and pops up that window that's javascript doing that so javascript can just add some extra functionality to your page and that's what's happening here okay let's go to the css file the main.css file so you can import just like how in your html file you can import cs the css you're going to use in your html you can import other css to use in your css file so we can see import font awesome.min.css now it's getting that right from you can see right here in our assets awesome.min.css so that's what this is and it's importing that css so we can use that also and then it's also going to import and then it's this url so here it's importing a file but here it's actually just importing a url so this url that's being imported you can see it says fonts it says google this is google fonts google has made available a bunch of different fonts that people can easily use on their websites by importing the font through google fonts and you can see it's the font source stands pro at the weight 300 400 and then we have this passion one font at the weight 400. now i want to show you something here where it says awesome.min.css if you looked when it opened the awesome file this css file looks very different than the other main.css file we were looking at because this has been minimized basically it goes through a automated process when you minimize a file goes through an automated process to make it as small as possible and so it takes up less space when someone's trying to download that file it's not as easy to read but it's easier for users to download that file and it still works just like any other css file so if we go if we look at this basic css we're just going to like briefly cover this but it starts with a reset so this is something that people often will include in their css to make sure all different browsers look kind of similar so you know there's a lot of different browsers that people can be using to access your website there's certain uh css properties and code you can put in that's going to make all browsers look very similar and it's also going to just make things look a little nicer than the default css so that's what we have in this reset so it's just going to always apply this reset and then we're going to the basic this is the stuff that's being added specifically for this website so now we're to the other sections and these other sections are stuff that's specifically for this website to to make it look special to make it look how we want to look so you can see the basic um way that css works is that well let's look at let's look at this as an example so this is the selector this is the property in this the value so we're selecting the body tag we're changing the color to this white color so you can see rgba that's just one way to specify a white that's 0.75 opacity and the font family is going to be source sans pro which remember was imported from google fonts and if that's not available it will just use a sans serif font the font size is going to be 14 points font weighs to be 300 points and the line height is 1.65 now with css how it works is whatever is the most specific is what style applies to the element so for instance we see the body here if we go over to the html we can see the body is here so almost everything is inside this body but if we styled say the inner class and we had styles that specifically reference this inner class that's going to override anything that applies to the body so a lot of these styles here are never going to be used if there's something more specific so let's scroll down to some of the other things that are being styled okay let's look at this we have h1 8 h2h3h4h5h6 these are the headings so the color this is another white color there's a lot of ways to specify the color and this is one of them font weight line height and the margin so if we change this color to something different we'll probably be able to see it right on our page so instead of putting a hex value or something i'm just going to type in the word green that's another way you can specify colors in css now go right over here if i refresh we should see something turn to green and you can see these words have not now all turned to green so let's go back and make this white again so another thing i want to show you is this whole section right here where it says media and screen max width 1680 pixels median screen max with 1280 pixels and then you see 980 pixels 736 pixels 480 pixels this is how to make your web page responsive so the it's so this css is going to specify a different style depending on how wide the screen is okay to see how these media queries work let's look at this other code this is for the thumbnails and the box so in the css we're selecting the thumbnails class and then we're selecting the box class that's inside the thumbnails class so if we go back over here we have the thumbnails class classical thumbnails and then we have the box class that's inside the thumbnails class so this is going to impact everything that's inside the box class which is this code right here so this code is going to change and you can see it's going to change depending on the width of the screen it's going to either be the width of 30 percent 45 percent or 100 percent so if we go back over to our page and then if i change the size you can see these boxes that show the thumbnails they're changing depending on how wide my browser is so if it's really narrow it just shows one the column then it goes up to two then it goes up to three and that's all from these media queries they're changing them this is changing the width depending on the size of the screen okay well let's make this bigger again and let's look at the things we want to change so when you're changing something based on a template you want to just try to find something you want to change and then try to figure out how to change it so i want to change this dark color around here i want this to be a different color so i have to figure out which css is is selecting this dark element around here so one way you can do it is just through trial and error trying to figure out what you need to change to change this background color so if i go back to my code i'm going to just search i do command f or control f and i'm going to search for background and i can see that this looks very similar to that color so i'm going to try changing this to another one so with this i can type in the name of a color or a hex code or i can just use this color pick here here that's in visual studio code so i want to make more of a greener color and now i'm going to save this i'll go back to my page i'll refresh and now it worked so i chose the right thing you know i think i want that maybe to be a little more of a dark green well that's easy i can go back over here and then i can make this a little darker and save it and then i refresh okay oh that looks nice now since this is green i kind of want this text or maybe some green to appear right up here somewhere or how about this maybe this circle let's see if i can get this circle to be green so one way to try to figure out what you need to change is to right click on something and then go to inspect element so this is bringing up the element in the html just in the inspector on the browser and so it looks like this could be the the right one and i can actually test it by changing the css right in here so i'm actually going to try changing this right here to instead of white let's see if i change the screen if that will change anything and did so you can see right on the page as i change it in the inspector it changes it on here so i so now i know that i'm looking for something that's styling this banner more see how it says banner more this is the selector that i'm looking for in my css so if i go back over to here and i just had just copied it over in my browser i'm going to find and then paste banner more so now i can change this border if i want to change that circle well how about this i'm going to make this bigger and i'm going to change this to a green color so we'll kind of match the other green that i have going now since this is just an example i'm not going to be like super exact but i could try to make it the exact same green or i could look at a color wheel to try to figure out what's the complementary color to the the different colors but for now i'll just choose that green and i'll go back over if i refresh now circle well you know maybe i will try to get the exact green because i wonder if it would match how that would look so let me go back over here i'm going to go back up to my body where i did my initial green here we go and now i will do my search again to come back down to here and i'm going to just add this new color and then go back over if i refresh okay nice one thing is see when you hover over it it gets white i want it to be a maybe a lighter green so let me go back over here and let me try to find the hover section so here you can see um well let me so where it says banner more and we change it to the border to be green well here's banner more hover that's what the style is going to be when someone's hovering their mouse over it now like nor we'll just keep all the same style as the original one but it will add these changes so i'm gonna change this border well i want i still want to be a two pixel when you're hovering over and now i want to change the color i'm going to change this to a lighter green and maybe add some more blue into it and let's see what that looks like i'll save that go back over and that didn't seem to well i guess it did change it oh yeah now it gets lighter green that's kind of nice yeah i like that so now when i click this it goes down so we can do the same thing by changing different fonts different colors just trying to figure out which css needs to change to change something okay the final thing i want to do is change the text color here so i'm going to go to inspect element and we can see oh it's color white banner h1 now let's just check make sure this is the right one so if i change this if i just type in blue yeah it changes to blue so let's change this to a green color i'm going to just copy this here the the css selector and then i'll just search for the css selector here and here it is so now instead of being white i'm going to change this to a green color again but this is going to be a lighter green than before so let's see what that looks like okay you know what i want to be the exact color that this circle becomes when you hover over it to get that color i can either go back into the css file or i can just inspect this element again and let's see i can turn on the hover state by clicking the hover here now i can get the color from right here and it's just going to copy this color here and i'll go back over here okay so now i'm just going to paste in the color here and i'll save that i'll go back over i'll and i'll refresh okay that's going to be it for now i know this design could be a little better but i'm going to count this good for now because i want to get on to the next part of this course which is purchasing a domain name so let me make sure everything's saved yep all my files are saved because i'm going to copy these files over actually let me quickly delete these because i'm not going to need any of these pictures because i'm not using those same pictures but we'll i'll just keep everything else here and we're going to be copying these files over to our hosting provider once we get that but right now we're going to get a domain name so now you have the files for your website or you're going to install wordpress now i'll show you how to get a custom domain this is what people type into the address bar on their web browser to access your website some examples are youtube.com freecodcamp.org or ces.tech these are all custom domains the end of the website name such as dot com dot org or dot net is called the top level domain or sometimes people just call it the domain ending while dot com is by far the most popular domain ending there are actually hundreds of other endings take a look at all of these on the screen right now one ending that is increasingly popular for people in the tech industry is dot tech and this video was made possible through a grant by the company who runs the dot tech domain when you are deciding what you want your domain to be you also have to decide what domain ending you want here are a few reasons you may want to consider less common domain ending more availability the less common endings have not been around as long so there are way more of them still available it's very hard to find a dotcom name that has not already been taken unique these newer domain endings may help you stand out as being unique which can also help create more of a lasting impression seo using a new domain ending won't hurt your search presence or seo it's worth noting that in the eyes of google and other search engines all tlds or these domain endings are equal so if you get a highly searched for name in your url it can be helpful for seo there are a bunch of places where you can buy domain name and they all work almost exactly the same here are some options godaddy.com domains.google namecheap.com get.tech i'm going to demonstrate how to purchase a domain name on git dot tech since we're getting a dot tech domain but just know the process is similar no matter where you buy your domain name here it makes it really easy you just type in the domain you want so i'm going to try bow.tech okay bodetech is unavailable now most likely the first domain you try is going to be unavailable so it gives some other examples but the other examples are almost never what you're looking for so it's good to have the other options in mind since this website is all about teaching tech i'm going to try both teachers.tech okay it's available and i can buy for one year so i'll choose that i'm not going to show you the whole purchase process but i do want to point out that this privacy protection it says recommended and i would also recommend this if you don't have privacy protection on your domain name then the records of your name and address will be out there for anybody to see your name your address your email address so if you don't get privacy protection you're going to start getting spam because there's companies out there that are constantly checking for all new domains registered to see if there's any real addresses or email addresses and then they're gonna start sending you stuff to advertise because they think you'll be interested in buying things for your new domain so definitely get privacy protection okay i'm just gonna place this order now we're finished buying the domain and to edit the domain we'll just go into manage orders and then find the order that i did for bo teaches.tech and this is our control panel i'll get that a little bigger and then we can update things in this control panel to make our website work but before we can update anything in this control panel we have to get hosting so now that you have your domain name you have to store your file somewhere when you go to any website on the internet your browser has to download the files for that website from a physical location somewhere else in the world a company that stores website files so that they are always available when someone goes to the url is called a hosting provider there are many hosting providers out there that will host files for your website some places will even host your website for free in this section i'll mainly be talking about hosting a static website or a wordpress site if you have a dynamic web application that has to run serverside code before sending web pages to the client then the setup will be a little more complicated than what i described here first i'll talk about how to get things set up on most paid hosting providers and then i'll show you how you can host your website for free on github pages here are some of the common hosting providers for web pages bluehost hostgator hostinger godaddy dreamhost almost all hosting providers have something in common which is this users manage the hosting service through a web application called cpanel or something very similar to cpanel so if you learn the basics of cpanel then it will be simple to use any hosting provider so all the hosting providers are very similar so matter which one you sign up for the steps should be basically the same first of all i would recommend just picking the cheapest possible hosting plan whatever hosting provider you use just pick the cheapest plan you can always upgrade later if you need to often the cheapest plan will work and you can always upgrade later if you somehow need more space or need more bandwidth make sure you choose that you already own this domain because you we've already purchased the domain and the rest of this is pretty straightforward okay i got my hosting and now i'm just going to launch the cpanel the exact way to get into cpanel could be different depending on your hosting provider but it should all be pretty similar and again your hosting provider may not have cpanel but it will definitely have something similar there's no single look for the cpanel dashboard because there are many themes and styles that host can use but the functionality is similar so one of the things you're most likely going to be using is the file manager the two main ways of getting files into your hosting provider is the file manager or through an ftp account so let's look at the file manager so the files we see here are the files that the hosting provider just puts there by default we're going to go to the public html section and this is where we're going to add the files so that's one thing you're going to have to look into when you are trying to upload your files to your hosting provider you're going to have to make sure you upload them to the right directory it may not be the root directory it's probably going to be something like this the public html directory and so those are the files that will appear when people go to your website i'm going to delete everything in here because i don't actually need anything in this directory now i'll go to upload and i cannot upload directories but there is a trick to be able to upload everything at once which is to create a zip file so let me select all my files and then i'll just go to compress and it could be different on windows but it's gonna be pretty similar how you're gonna be able to find something to make them into a zip file so i'm just going to upload the zip file so this includes all the assets and all the images and even the background video so it could take a little bit to upload okay i'm going to go back here and i'm going to extract and this is just an extra directory that i can delete okay i have my website uploaded to the hosting provider we still have to connect the hosting provider to the domain name and we'll do that in a little bit for now i'm just going to close this and let's look at some of the other things you can do with cpanel so we could have uploaded the files through ftp here we can create an ftp account if you have an ftp client like filezilla you can ftp into this and you can easily upload files another thing we can do is create a subdomain let's say we create one called blog so now it's going to be blog.teachers.tech the way i get files into that subdomain is it should show up right in my file manager so if i go back into the file manager now you can see there's a new folder it's called blog.bowteaches.tech anything i put into this folder will now appear at the subdomain once i connect my hosting to the domain name so the two other things i want to show you are the email accounts and the wordpress installer there are a bunch of other things on here that you can mess around and continue learning but i'm just going to cover these other two for now so right here you can create an email account we can also create an email account on the dot tech admin page which i'll show you that in a second again later let's say we want bo at bowteaches.tech and we create a password and then create account okay i can set up the mail client now this is just going to give you different ways to set up the client depending on which method you want to use i'm not going to go through every one but depending on what you want to do you just set it up differently okay the final thing is the wordpress installer so i was saying it's very simple to install wordpress once you have your hosting just click on wordpress installer and then click on install now and then that's pretty much it once you install wordpress you can now use wordpress right on your site and you can watch any wordpress tutorial to learn how to use wordpress i'm not going to install wordpress right now because i'm going to use the other files that i already uploaded onto there so what i'm going to do now is just go back to the dashboard and now i'm going to connect the hosting provider to the domain name and to do that we're going to scroll down until you see the name servers now no matter what company you use to create your domain name and no matter what hosting provider you use you're almost always going to connect these two together with these name servers so i'm going to copy this name server and then go back over to the control panel for the dot tech domain and then you can see there's a name servers manage name servers that use this domain name so i'll click that and then i'm just going to paste in the first name server and then i'll get the second name server and then i'll paste in the second name server we'll put it here and you don't really need to have every name server filled in so i'm just going to go through and delete these other two and then update name servers now everything really should be set up for my website to work sometimes it can take up to 24 hours for everything to update so you may have to wait up to 24 hours before you can actually see your website live okay i waited some time and the name servers have been able to propagate throughout the internet and now the website works so i go to bowteachers.tech and it loads so you can see this if i click here it should open up yep it opens up a video to watch here okay everything's working i can now access my website at a custom domain once you know how it's actually pretty simple to set up a website to host for free at github pages the first step is to create a github account and log into your account and then you just need to create a new repository the name of the repository is very important so for the name of the repository you have to type in your username your github account name and then you just type in github.io bo fcc.github.io this is going to create a repository that will be a special type of repository that will be able to host our website on github pages okay now i'm just going to create a repository okay now that we create the repository we can you can either upload your files using the command line or you can do it right through the web interface so i'll just click upload an existing file and i'm just going to drag and drop the files so let me grab these files here and just bring it over here now it's just going to upload all the files for our website okay all the files are uploaded and i'll just do commit changes after the files are done processing i can go to this url just copy it right here and i'll open up a new tab i'll paste in the url and that did not work okay it takes a few minutes for the updates to show up so if we just wait a little bit and then try refreshing it should work it can take up to 20 minutes for the changes you create on github to show up on the github pages but it's now loading you can see in the address bar bofcc.github and we can see our page now we just need to make this show up at bowteachers.tech before i make this show up at our custom url let me show you how easy it is to make changes to the page on github so you can always change it on your local computer and then upload it again or use the github interface or you can change it right on this github interface you can change the html right on here so in order to edit this i'm going to click the pencil icon for edit this file and then i'm just going to update the title here instead of courses from beau carnes i'm going to call this programming courses from beau carnes and then i can just scroll down to the bottom and you can put a commit message you can put a commit message but i'll just leave this as the default for now and just click commit changes now again it's going to take possibly up to 15 minutes to show up on here but while we're waiting i will show you how to make this work with your custom url and then if we do this right we'll be able to know that we're not getting it from our hosting provider because this will change so here's bo teaches.tech currently and you can see it says courses from beau carnes and this is coming right from our hosting provider that we set up before but now we're switching it to use github pages for the hosting provider so after we update this this will say programming courses from beau carnes to reflect the change that was just made on github so the first step is to go back into github and i'm going to click on settings if i scroll all the way toward the bottom of the settings i can put in a custom domain custom domains allow you to serve your site from a domain other than both fcc.github.io so i'll put bo teaches dot tech and then i'll save it so now that we updated the github settings i'm gonna have to go back to our domain dashboard so this is at the tech control panel or dashboard and to make this work with github pages i'm going to have to go to dns management no matter what company you purchase your domain from there's going to be some way to update the dns settings of your domain so i'm going to manage dns here and i'm going to update some things the first thing i'm going to update is the cname record so the cname is like an alias or it's a way to forward to a different domain so i'm going to add a cname record and for the host name i'll put www so when you go to www.bowties.tech we're going to forward to bofcc.github.io and then i'll just add this record so so now www.bow.teaches.tech will go there i also want to set it up so just bo teaches.tech without the www will also go to the github pages page so to make that work i'm going to add an a record so i will put nothing here and then for this destination address i'm going to put an ip address that comes right from github so it's going to be 185.199.108.15 three and then i can click add record okay that should be all set so i'm gonna close this for now so before i updated the name servers to work with the hosting provider but now that i'm using github pages and i updated the dns settings i don't need the name servers i used previously so to make these new dns settings work i'm going to have to default the name servers back to what they were it says right here required to use our dns management service with your domain name so it says we need i need to go back to the default name servers so i'm going to copy this i'll go up to the top here and then i'm going to change this to venus because that was the second one and as long as you have two that should work so i'm going to update the name servers and now anytime you update the name servers you could have to wait up to 24 hours so i'm going to have to wait and then i'll i will check the website to see if it updates to use the page github pages instead of the hosting provider we had before so it's been over 24 hours and and check this out i'm at bo teaches.tech and it says programming courses from beau carnes so i'm now loading the page right from github pages and now whenever i want to update the page i just update the files on the github repo and then within 15 minutes or so the changes will reflect right on the actual domain right on the page both teachers.tech so now you know how to set up a website with github pages so now you've learned how to create a simple website get a custom domain and host the website through various methods thanks for watching
