00:01 - hi everybody my name is kayla banks i'm
00:04 - 15 years old and this is my crazy dad
00:09 - hi i'm phillip banks and i'm her dad
00:12 - that's not the crazy part
00:13 - [Laughter]
00:14 - so we're here to talk about kind of what
00:17 - jim hit on is how to raise a family in
00:19 - tech but it's so much more than that
00:21 - it's about getting young people into the
00:24 - community and kind of what we're doing
00:26 - and kind of best practices and things i
00:28 - want you to get about what you can do to
00:30 - bring more young people in the family i
00:33 - mean in the community
00:36 - because how diverse are you if you're
00:38 - not considering youth
00:41 - it's we have so many women's
00:43 - and ethnic
00:45 - diversity efforts but not enough youth
00:48 - and to add on to that how diverse really
00:50 - is your community if you don't bring in
00:52 - youth we like to think our communities
00:54 - are diverse because we include women and
00:56 - different people of color and even at
00:58 - the women's open source lunch we were
01:00 - talking about how
01:02 - you know who decides what's diverse
01:04 - and the most overlooked group is youth
01:08 - we're literally hacking into unix linux
01:11 - kernels hacking into minecraft making
01:13 - games we're the most overlooked
01:16 - group
01:17 - and
01:18 - in like a whole bunch of programs like
01:21 - for one example
01:23 - i use a a popular program i'm pretty
01:26 - sure most of you guys have heard of it
01:27 - it's called slack
01:29 - and
01:30 - i use this to collaborate among teens
01:32 - around the world and we were approaching
01:34 - slack about what we're doing we found
01:36 - out that we legally aren't even able to
01:39 - use slack because we're underage
01:42 - and there's a lot of platforms like this
01:44 - that put age restrictions and we
01:46 - literally are stopping
01:48 - in the tech community from progressing
01:50 - because these age restrictions
01:52 - so our talk has changed like 10 times
01:54 - listen to a lot of the good talks at
01:56 - this conference and uh and we were we
01:58 - thought of that one because uh guy
02:00 - martin did a talk yesterday about slack
02:02 - and community and we had a story about
02:04 - slack and just
02:06 - in for slack's purposes we we could also
02:09 - say we talked to them and they're trying
02:11 - to lower the age limits so that younger
02:14 - people can use it
02:16 - so
02:17 - we want to start out talking a little
02:19 - bit about who we are and why we're here
02:21 - but jim hit on most of this stuff but
02:23 - i'll introduce our tech family over to
02:25 - the right is my my son phillip he's the
02:28 - oldest he's 28 and he's a sis ad man and
02:32 - an i.t guy at school then we got hunter
02:35 - right next to him he's a video a game
02:38 - developer and if you google open source
02:41 - gaming
02:42 - you'll see a lot of hunters post
02:45 - uh over to the left we have my son david
02:48 - he's wants to be a surgeon but
02:50 - somehow we're gonna tech that up i don't
02:52 - know we're building cyborgs or something
02:54 - we i tell this boy we're gonna we're
02:56 - gonna work with brainson's connections
02:59 - and then we got at the bottom my
03:01 - daughter kayla
03:03 - and i think you've met her but tell us a
03:05 - little bit more about you kayla
03:07 - well like jim was saying i've been
03:09 - speaking at conferences since i was 11
03:11 - years old and this was my biggest one at
03:14 - o'reilly's oscon which i did the keynote
03:16 - and that one was a group of about five
03:20 - four thousand people in the room but
03:22 - really it reached a bigger audience
03:23 - because that talk kind of went viral
03:26 - and i also had the pleasure of visiting
03:29 - the white house under president obama
03:32 - and
03:32 - [Laughter]
03:33 - notice that
03:36 - it's a lot different there now
03:40 - i was also featured at the melissa
03:42 - harris perry show and
03:45 - we also got to go to the mayor of los
03:47 - angeles and that's also the
03:51 - cto yeah chief technology technology
03:54 - officer of l.a school
03:57 - there's another picture a chief for
03:59 - diversity the chief chief technology
04:01 - officer for the united states of america
04:04 - is a woman for women who want to know
04:06 - that so
04:07 - it was a great role model for my
04:09 - daughter just meeting her and talking
04:11 - about
04:12 - being in her position
04:16 - so the first thing we want to talk about
04:18 - is how we do things
04:20 - how
04:21 - what's what's our method so kayla how do
04:23 - we engage
04:25 - how do we use engagement well as i
04:27 - mentioned earlier i'm 15 so i still go
04:29 - to school and every ride to school we
04:32 - usually have a discussion whether it's a
04:33 - debate
04:34 - or just a regular conversation about a
04:38 - whole different bunch of different
04:39 - topics and usually we try to relate it
04:41 - around tech
04:43 - and
04:44 - i feel that like having these talks on
04:46 - the way to school on the way home it
04:47 - makes us engaged like the reason why
04:50 - kids
04:51 - like the stuff is because it pertains to
04:53 - us we're not just going to you know
04:55 - write a whole bunch of code just for the
04:57 - purpose of it it has to relate to us and
04:59 - i think engagement is a crucial part in
05:02 - involving youth in the tech community
05:05 - so we we believe in
05:07 - a lot of reverse engineering and i think
05:10 - that gets a lot of youth involved in
05:12 - something and it's whatever thing that
05:15 - they like to do
05:18 - so at southern california linux expo
05:20 - where i'm one of the chairs there and my
05:22 - kids have been involved since the
05:24 - beginning what 16 years ago
05:26 - um
05:27 - we get
05:28 - we started to implement more youth
05:31 - programs and we're starting to get more
05:32 - high schools to come and and you'll find
05:36 - that you ask them to reverse engineer
05:38 - stuff
05:39 - and just think how does that work how do
05:41 - we get that there how do we get that and
05:43 - then it gets them started on a path
05:45 - that
05:46 - will get them to
05:47 - [Music]
05:48 - every community like we have even some
05:51 - kids that are current of colonel
05:52 - developers and i mean one who just like
05:55 - idolizes line historicals and so he was
05:57 - like you gotta talk to him when you get
05:59 - there so
06:00 - we
06:00 - you get that engagement and then you get
06:02 - them started and then sky's the limit
06:07 - next is goals
06:09 - what do we do with goals
06:11 - well goals are a huge part of our year
06:14 - and when i say goals i'm not just
06:15 - talking about new year's resolutions
06:17 - that everyone sets and forgets about
06:18 - during the year the goals that we set we
06:21 - try to tend to set ten goals eight goals
06:23 - that we make for ourselves and two goals
06:26 - that our dad sets and most of the time
06:28 - their tech goals each year i try to
06:29 - learn a new language
06:31 - and but although they're not always tech
06:34 - they're always they're also like
06:35 - personal and physical and emotional
06:37 - goals and these goals make me strive to
06:40 - be a better person
06:41 - like last year my goal was to learn
06:44 - javascript more and teach more kids and
06:48 - i was able to do that
06:50 - yeah a lot of times we'll feel like man
06:52 - we're slacking but
06:54 - when you start looking at those goals
06:56 - and we do like every three or four
06:58 - months we do review of your pace on your
07:00 - goals and i tell the kids you know me
07:03 - and my wife set two of their goals they
07:05 - can set eight goals for the year but
07:08 - we'll set two because you know you kind
07:09 - of want to guide their course so if
07:11 - you're mentoring or you're working with
07:13 - youth or niece nephews
07:15 - then
07:17 - having them have some investment in
07:18 - their own goals
07:20 - is the key thing because you know then
07:22 - they think
07:23 - stop bossing me around i'm
07:26 - kind of doing this myself
07:31 - so
07:32 - we
07:33 - the thing with getting youth into our
07:36 - communities
07:37 - is
07:38 - the barriers
07:40 - you feel
07:42 - fear in doing something with adults and
07:44 - you know and a lot of people i always
07:46 - ask kayla like you're not terrified
07:48 - being in front of a lot of people that
07:50 - are adults you know the kid are the kids
07:53 - audiences you know easy and she's always
07:55 - done adult
07:56 - audiences tell us about embracing the
07:59 - fear kb
08:00 - well one particular story is when i was
08:03 - 12 years old my first big audience was
08:06 - at pycon in montreal
08:08 - and it was a lightning talk and what my
08:10 - dad told me was you can get up on the
08:13 - stage you can completely fall just trip
08:16 - over this whole stage
08:18 - and
08:18 - one thing to remember to do is just
08:20 - laugh at yourself and i guess that
08:22 - advice worked out because i'm here
08:24 - speaking in front of all of you guys
08:25 - today
08:26 - [Laughter]
08:28 - so if we trip or anything on the stage
08:30 - we are going to laugh at ourselves if we
08:32 - fluff any lines believe it's going to
08:34 - happen
08:35 - uh
08:36 - yeah so that one we pretty much said
08:39 - like the fear of of doing stuff a lot of
08:42 - the young developers they are afraid of
08:45 - even submitting code or
08:48 - entering in a lot of these things
08:49 - because like one of the kids that was a
08:51 - kernel developer he he said you know his
08:54 - code getting rejected was like the
08:57 - biggest thing to him and yet i was like
08:59 - go back go go there again keep doing
09:02 - that and
09:04 - once they get over that
09:05 - then they can do everything
09:08 - and so that's why i tell them every
09:11 - project isn't your first one you're your
09:13 - best one you know it's some things go
09:16 - wrong and interviewing a lot of
09:18 - programmers before they you know spoke
09:21 - at our conferences the conferences we've
09:23 - been at uh one of the main things i
09:25 - asked them you know is like how did you
09:27 - get started and a lot of them said i
09:29 - wanted to make a video game
09:31 - somewhere where along the line that
09:32 - didn't work and i remember that was my
09:34 - first thing when i was 10 i wanted to be
09:37 - like a video game so i learned
09:39 - that didn't work but it led me into so
09:41 - many other way places
09:44 - comparing yourself to no one kayla tell
09:46 - me about that
09:48 - and another thing that ties into this is
09:50 - imposter syndrome i'm a victim of
09:52 - imposter syndrome and i know a lot of
09:53 - people in the tech community are victims
09:56 - of it too
09:57 - on the way here it was an 11 hour flight
10:00 - and i'm sitting here thinking in my mind
10:01 - like why am i being able to fly all the
10:04 - way to prague like i'm not as smart as
10:06 - most of the people in this room
10:08 - and
10:09 - literally when i was sitting in don
10:11 - foster's talk yesterday
10:13 - like five people raised their hand and
10:15 - said that they contributed to the linux
10:17 - kernel like we're literally contributing
10:20 - to the linux kernel and i'm pretty sure
10:22 - a lot of people are capable or have
10:25 - already done stuff like this so i have
10:27 - to constantly remind myself to compare
10:29 - myself to no one and instead motivate
10:32 - myself are inspired by other people like
10:35 - reuben for example who had a great talk
10:38 - on monday yeah that was a great talk if
10:40 - you missed reuben's talk you know seeing
10:42 - a young kid 11 years old if i'm correct
10:45 - still the 11 right yeah
10:47 - and him getting up on stage and saying
10:49 - all the stuff that he's doing
10:51 - if he's not in your community if you're
10:52 - not you're looking at him like ah that
10:54 - was nothing then
10:56 - you know your community is is not as
10:59 - diverse as you need it to be
11:01 - um
11:03 - uh
11:04 - the biggest thing about the this one for
11:06 - me and i don't know if you have some
11:08 - more on this one too kayla
11:10 - is that adults
11:12 - the one thing we
11:14 - we work with a lot of students now we've
11:16 - started programs around la
11:19 - and hopefully around the world so where
11:22 - we're dealing with a lot of young people
11:24 - that are versed to tech
11:27 - from the start
11:28 - and
11:29 - to get them from ground zero to where
11:32 - you you know where they want to be
11:34 - is a hard thing because i know with my
11:36 - own kids
11:37 - i had to
11:38 - you know stop
11:40 - monitoring them and
11:42 - micromanaging them and thinking
11:44 - they have to take the same path as me
11:47 - they take everybody takes a whole
11:49 - different path to where they want to be
11:52 - so if you do it your way they're
11:54 - different than you and so we're that's
11:56 - our big thing with schools do we learn
11:58 - anything like that with uh some of the
12:00 - students at uh some of the schools so
12:02 - far did you get
12:04 - yes and like my dad mentioned we've been
12:06 - working with schools and most of the
12:08 - time we realize that a lot of these kids
12:11 - tend to just need a bit of motivation
12:13 - and from on there you have your own
12:16 - self-motivation and i think that's
12:18 - crucial and even going to conferences
12:20 - like this i tend to get triggered and
12:22 - have a whole bunch of self-motivation
12:24 - even go into some of the booths like red
12:26 - hat and all the other ones i go home and
12:29 - with all these papers and i'm like what
12:30 - am i going to learn next like what am i
12:32 - going to program
12:34 - yeah so
12:36 - and a lot of the
12:37 - people at the booth the clouds and boots
12:39 - on our new thing is kubernetes so we're
12:41 - just like what is that and so we
12:43 - probably stopped by a ton of your boots
12:44 - and then grabbed you you're a gang of
12:46 - times about that because i want high
12:48 - school kids to start learning that kind
12:50 - of thing
12:51 - so
12:52 - from there
12:54 - we start taking it to the next level so
12:56 - where do we want to go from there kayla
12:58 - they're probably asking themselves okay
13:00 - you told us a lot about what you're
13:02 - doing a lot of things that you know we
13:04 - could do
13:05 - what's next what's our
13:08 - what are we doing
13:09 - well we're not mostly focusing ourselves
13:12 - now now we're starting to focus on other
13:14 - kids getting other kids involved and so
13:17 - as you can see right now we're teaching
13:19 - at schools and we're starting our own
13:21 - company called banks family tech which
13:22 - is going to be on facebook soon
13:25 - and during the summer of la we
13:28 - taught at
13:29 - parent middle school and
13:32 - tom bradley middle school and as you can
13:34 - see these are some of our kids
13:36 - and
13:37 - teaching basically is the next
13:38 - generation like we said youth they're
13:41 - the overlooked group
13:43 - and so directly reaching out to this
13:45 - group and teaching them you know you got
13:47 - to be the part of
13:48 - you've got to be the new generation of
13:50 - the tech community and this is part of
13:53 - our teaching at schools yeah you notice
13:55 - uh some of these are even young this is
13:58 - a class of fifth graders
14:00 - and
14:01 - i i don't like to put down any languages
14:04 - in particular because everything serves
14:05 - purpose but
14:07 - we do programs where they're actually
14:08 - learning real code because that is a lot
14:12 - of stem programs science technology
14:15 - engineering and math
14:16 - programs
14:17 - uh in the united states are focused on
14:21 - just saying we're teaching some coding
14:23 - and we're not big fans of that you know
14:26 - like one of the things i really loved
14:28 - about ruben's talk is he was he was
14:29 - doing some python writing isn't and
14:32 - young kids can learn this now a lot of
14:34 - times we use things like scratch is a
14:37 - language that it it's like scratching a
14:39 - chalkboard for me to hear because
14:41 - they're not really learning life
14:43 - applicable
14:45 - languages
14:47 - so uh
14:49 - so we're teaching in schools
14:51 - and
14:52 - what do we want to do from there we uh
14:55 - we want you to
14:56 - our next thing was like how do you get
14:58 - involved
14:59 - we want
15:00 - there's so many tech minds in this room
15:03 - that can that can give back to the
15:05 - communities there's if everyone in here
15:09 - multiplied that knowledge at one school
15:12 - just going to one group of kids and
15:14 - getting one kid
15:16 - involved
15:18 - imagine how many kids around this world
15:21 - will be because
15:22 - i only i tell them this is just a tool
15:26 - you can do whatever you want in life
15:27 - there's some people that were graphic
15:29 - design
15:30 - and that's what my son hunter it's my
15:32 - son hunter teaching us uh these two
15:34 - schools that's my son david down there
15:36 - helping with this
15:38 - hunter was more graphic design
15:40 - applied to video game design
15:43 - so
15:44 - how are we gonna um that's how
15:46 - you can get involved and
15:49 - help us
15:50 - so now kayla made this i said tell tell
15:52 - us about this one kayla so this light is
15:55 - they can dedicated to our community as
15:57 - we mentioned earlier we live in los
15:59 - angeles but even all the way on the
16:01 - other side of the world we literally
16:03 - have so many familiar faces like
16:06 - mythia
16:09 - um that's our friend guy and adrian and
16:12 - all these people and so being in tech
16:14 - really enables a community and that's
16:17 - what we're trying to portray and yeah
16:19 - these are all of our friends there shout
16:21 - out to nipia a lot of the people we've
16:23 - seen here today so like i'm saying we've
16:26 - changed the side so many times seeing so
16:28 - many new faces you know nithya talks and
16:31 - kayla and the women's in tech talk came
16:34 - out with a couple new friends and
16:36 - and then i was like different people we
16:38 - didn't even know we're here you know
16:40 - jono you see we see him in every city or
16:43 - i don't know where that guy ever stops
16:46 - at the house
16:48 - and uh of course our new friend angela
16:50 - is here uh running this conference and
16:54 - and
16:55 - so community so
16:57 - having my kids in this community all
17:00 - this time there's so many people we can
17:02 - we
17:03 - i mean even when we went to the white
17:04 - house we
17:05 - there was people across the room like
17:07 - hey there's so and so and they're in the
17:08 - tech community and then they offer their
17:11 - advice or anything if they know them
17:13 - but imagine if more kids are involved
17:15 - and
17:16 - get these contacts and everything like
17:19 - like some of our young programmers like
17:20 - reuben get these contacts and then they
17:23 - help them and they help develop them
17:26 - as programmers and as developers as
17:28 - designers and engineers
17:32 - so
17:33 - now with all that
17:35 - what are they going to do are they going
17:36 - to reach out to us
17:37 - yeah you guys going to reach out to us
17:39 - are you guys going to
17:41 - you guys going to contact us on facebook
17:44 - and so there's our facebook that's my
17:46 - primary source of contact and you can
17:49 - also since we have to leave right after
17:50 - i have to get back to school you guys
17:52 - can shoot us the email and lastly you
17:55 - guys can for sure tweet us because our
17:57 - twitter game is about to be a1
18:00 - yeah we're not
18:02 - as big on our twitter
18:04 - but we're going to be all over social
18:06 - media and this is the thing we wanted to
18:08 - get everybody else involved and just

Cleaned transcript:

hi everybody my name is kayla banks i'm 15 years old and this is my crazy dad hi i'm phillip banks and i'm her dad that's not the crazy part [Laughter] so we're here to talk about kind of what jim hit on is how to raise a family in tech but it's so much more than that it's about getting young people into the community and kind of what we're doing and kind of best practices and things i want you to get about what you can do to bring more young people in the family i mean in the community because how diverse are you if you're not considering youth it's we have so many women's and ethnic diversity efforts but not enough youth and to add on to that how diverse really is your community if you don't bring in youth we like to think our communities are diverse because we include women and different people of color and even at the women's open source lunch we were talking about how you know who decides what's diverse and the most overlooked group is youth we're literally hacking into unix linux kernels hacking into minecraft making games we're the most overlooked group and in like a whole bunch of programs like for one example i use a a popular program i'm pretty sure most of you guys have heard of it it's called slack and i use this to collaborate among teens around the world and we were approaching slack about what we're doing we found out that we legally aren't even able to use slack because we're underage and there's a lot of platforms like this that put age restrictions and we literally are stopping in the tech community from progressing because these age restrictions so our talk has changed like 10 times listen to a lot of the good talks at this conference and uh and we were we thought of that one because uh guy martin did a talk yesterday about slack and community and we had a story about slack and just in for slack's purposes we we could also say we talked to them and they're trying to lower the age limits so that younger people can use it so we want to start out talking a little bit about who we are and why we're here but jim hit on most of this stuff but i'll introduce our tech family over to the right is my my son phillip he's the oldest he's 28 and he's a sis ad man and an i.t guy at school then we got hunter right next to him he's a video a game developer and if you google open source gaming you'll see a lot of hunters post uh over to the left we have my son david he's wants to be a surgeon but somehow we're gonna tech that up i don't know we're building cyborgs or something we i tell this boy we're gonna we're gonna work with brainson's connections and then we got at the bottom my daughter kayla and i think you've met her but tell us a little bit more about you kayla well like jim was saying i've been speaking at conferences since i was 11 years old and this was my biggest one at o'reilly's oscon which i did the keynote and that one was a group of about five four thousand people in the room but really it reached a bigger audience because that talk kind of went viral and i also had the pleasure of visiting the white house under president obama and [Laughter] notice that it's a lot different there now i was also featured at the melissa harris perry show and we also got to go to the mayor of los angeles and that's also the cto yeah chief technology technology officer of l.a school there's another picture a chief for diversity the chief chief technology officer for the united states of america is a woman for women who want to know that so it was a great role model for my daughter just meeting her and talking about being in her position so the first thing we want to talk about is how we do things how what's what's our method so kayla how do we engage how do we use engagement well as i mentioned earlier i'm 15 so i still go to school and every ride to school we usually have a discussion whether it's a debate or just a regular conversation about a whole different bunch of different topics and usually we try to relate it around tech and i feel that like having these talks on the way to school on the way home it makes us engaged like the reason why kids like the stuff is because it pertains to us we're not just going to you know write a whole bunch of code just for the purpose of it it has to relate to us and i think engagement is a crucial part in involving youth in the tech community so we we believe in a lot of reverse engineering and i think that gets a lot of youth involved in something and it's whatever thing that they like to do so at southern california linux expo where i'm one of the chairs there and my kids have been involved since the beginning what 16 years ago um we get we started to implement more youth programs and we're starting to get more high schools to come and and you'll find that you ask them to reverse engineer stuff and just think how does that work how do we get that there how do we get that and then it gets them started on a path that will get them to every community like we have even some kids that are current of colonel developers and i mean one who just like idolizes line historicals and so he was like you gotta talk to him when you get there so we you get that engagement and then you get them started and then sky's the limit next is goals what do we do with goals well goals are a huge part of our year and when i say goals i'm not just talking about new year's resolutions that everyone sets and forgets about during the year the goals that we set we try to tend to set ten goals eight goals that we make for ourselves and two goals that our dad sets and most of the time their tech goals each year i try to learn a new language and but although they're not always tech they're always they're also like personal and physical and emotional goals and these goals make me strive to be a better person like last year my goal was to learn javascript more and teach more kids and i was able to do that yeah a lot of times we'll feel like man we're slacking but when you start looking at those goals and we do like every three or four months we do review of your pace on your goals and i tell the kids you know me and my wife set two of their goals they can set eight goals for the year but we'll set two because you know you kind of want to guide their course so if you're mentoring or you're working with youth or niece nephews then having them have some investment in their own goals is the key thing because you know then they think stop bossing me around i'm kind of doing this myself so we the thing with getting youth into our communities is the barriers you feel fear in doing something with adults and you know and a lot of people i always ask kayla like you're not terrified being in front of a lot of people that are adults you know the kid are the kids audiences you know easy and she's always done adult audiences tell us about embracing the fear kb well one particular story is when i was 12 years old my first big audience was at pycon in montreal and it was a lightning talk and what my dad told me was you can get up on the stage you can completely fall just trip over this whole stage and one thing to remember to do is just laugh at yourself and i guess that advice worked out because i'm here speaking in front of all of you guys today [Laughter] so if we trip or anything on the stage we are going to laugh at ourselves if we fluff any lines believe it's going to happen uh yeah so that one we pretty much said like the fear of of doing stuff a lot of the young developers they are afraid of even submitting code or entering in a lot of these things because like one of the kids that was a kernel developer he he said you know his code getting rejected was like the biggest thing to him and yet i was like go back go go there again keep doing that and once they get over that then they can do everything and so that's why i tell them every project isn't your first one you're your best one you know it's some things go wrong and interviewing a lot of programmers before they you know spoke at our conferences the conferences we've been at uh one of the main things i asked them you know is like how did you get started and a lot of them said i wanted to make a video game somewhere where along the line that didn't work and i remember that was my first thing when i was 10 i wanted to be like a video game so i learned that didn't work but it led me into so many other way places comparing yourself to no one kayla tell me about that and another thing that ties into this is imposter syndrome i'm a victim of imposter syndrome and i know a lot of people in the tech community are victims of it too on the way here it was an 11 hour flight and i'm sitting here thinking in my mind like why am i being able to fly all the way to prague like i'm not as smart as most of the people in this room and literally when i was sitting in don foster's talk yesterday like five people raised their hand and said that they contributed to the linux kernel like we're literally contributing to the linux kernel and i'm pretty sure a lot of people are capable or have already done stuff like this so i have to constantly remind myself to compare myself to no one and instead motivate myself are inspired by other people like reuben for example who had a great talk on monday yeah that was a great talk if you missed reuben's talk you know seeing a young kid 11 years old if i'm correct still the 11 right yeah and him getting up on stage and saying all the stuff that he's doing if he's not in your community if you're not you're looking at him like ah that was nothing then you know your community is is not as diverse as you need it to be um uh the biggest thing about the this one for me and i don't know if you have some more on this one too kayla is that adults the one thing we we work with a lot of students now we've started programs around la and hopefully around the world so where we're dealing with a lot of young people that are versed to tech from the start and to get them from ground zero to where you you know where they want to be is a hard thing because i know with my own kids i had to you know stop monitoring them and micromanaging them and thinking they have to take the same path as me they take everybody takes a whole different path to where they want to be so if you do it your way they're different than you and so we're that's our big thing with schools do we learn anything like that with uh some of the students at uh some of the schools so far did you get yes and like my dad mentioned we've been working with schools and most of the time we realize that a lot of these kids tend to just need a bit of motivation and from on there you have your own selfmotivation and i think that's crucial and even going to conferences like this i tend to get triggered and have a whole bunch of selfmotivation even go into some of the booths like red hat and all the other ones i go home and with all these papers and i'm like what am i going to learn next like what am i going to program yeah so and a lot of the people at the booth the clouds and boots on our new thing is kubernetes so we're just like what is that and so we probably stopped by a ton of your boots and then grabbed you you're a gang of times about that because i want high school kids to start learning that kind of thing so from there we start taking it to the next level so where do we want to go from there kayla they're probably asking themselves okay you told us a lot about what you're doing a lot of things that you know we could do what's next what's our what are we doing well we're not mostly focusing ourselves now now we're starting to focus on other kids getting other kids involved and so as you can see right now we're teaching at schools and we're starting our own company called banks family tech which is going to be on facebook soon and during the summer of la we taught at parent middle school and tom bradley middle school and as you can see these are some of our kids and teaching basically is the next generation like we said youth they're the overlooked group and so directly reaching out to this group and teaching them you know you got to be the part of you've got to be the new generation of the tech community and this is part of our teaching at schools yeah you notice uh some of these are even young this is a class of fifth graders and i i don't like to put down any languages in particular because everything serves purpose but we do programs where they're actually learning real code because that is a lot of stem programs science technology engineering and math programs uh in the united states are focused on just saying we're teaching some coding and we're not big fans of that you know like one of the things i really loved about ruben's talk is he was he was doing some python writing isn't and young kids can learn this now a lot of times we use things like scratch is a language that it it's like scratching a chalkboard for me to hear because they're not really learning life applicable languages so uh so we're teaching in schools and what do we want to do from there we uh we want you to our next thing was like how do you get involved we want there's so many tech minds in this room that can that can give back to the communities there's if everyone in here multiplied that knowledge at one school just going to one group of kids and getting one kid involved imagine how many kids around this world will be because i only i tell them this is just a tool you can do whatever you want in life there's some people that were graphic design and that's what my son hunter it's my son hunter teaching us uh these two schools that's my son david down there helping with this hunter was more graphic design applied to video game design so how are we gonna um that's how you can get involved and help us so now kayla made this i said tell tell us about this one kayla so this light is they can dedicated to our community as we mentioned earlier we live in los angeles but even all the way on the other side of the world we literally have so many familiar faces like mythia um that's our friend guy and adrian and all these people and so being in tech really enables a community and that's what we're trying to portray and yeah these are all of our friends there shout out to nipia a lot of the people we've seen here today so like i'm saying we've changed the side so many times seeing so many new faces you know nithya talks and kayla and the women's in tech talk came out with a couple new friends and and then i was like different people we didn't even know we're here you know jono you see we see him in every city or i don't know where that guy ever stops at the house and uh of course our new friend angela is here uh running this conference and and so community so having my kids in this community all this time there's so many people we can we i mean even when we went to the white house we there was people across the room like hey there's so and so and they're in the tech community and then they offer their advice or anything if they know them but imagine if more kids are involved and get these contacts and everything like like some of our young programmers like reuben get these contacts and then they help them and they help develop them as programmers and as developers as designers and engineers so now with all that what are they going to do are they going to reach out to us yeah you guys going to reach out to us are you guys going to you guys going to contact us on facebook and so there's our facebook that's my primary source of contact and you can also since we have to leave right after i have to get back to school you guys can shoot us the email and lastly you guys can for sure tweet us because our twitter game is about to be a1 yeah we're not as big on our twitter but we're going to be all over social media and this is the thing we wanted to get everybody else involved and just like you know we want you to reach out to your communities reach back out to us if you if you want to start an effort or anything and wherever in the world this world's a small place as we've shown it's a small place and you know we're here and there we talk to people all over the world all the time and get some of your input some of the things that work for you and if you need our help the same thing so on behalf of myself and the banks representing the rest of the banks family from all over los angeles california we like to say thanks thanks for coming out nice hold on one second so i want to make hold on one sec so this and this is unscripted so but i want to make a deal with you so uh many of you know i know is clyde super saiyan in the audience somewhere around here have you met clyde yet from our organization so clyde runs all of our training and development uh at the linux foundation and we have uh certification tests for linux sys admins for kubernetes for a whole bunch of different technology we have selfpaced training online training we would love to offer for your classes in los angeles access to that you know free testing recertification so uh as you're building out that program hopefully oh you can take us up with adrian was on one of our slides he's uh so he yeah he said you guys would love to help so awesome we love it let's do it we love it thank you
