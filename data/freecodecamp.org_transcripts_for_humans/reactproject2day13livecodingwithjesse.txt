With timestamps:

00:06 - hey everybody it's
00:08 - Jesse and um I hope you all had a good
00:11 - uh good
00:13 - weekend today we're going to keep
00:16 - working on our server uh. JS
00:20 - file so last week we with at least at
00:25 - the end of last week uh we got our file
00:27 - uploads working and we also got the
00:30 - emails working uh with sand
00:33 - grid so the next step is to send data to
00:38 - our project management system which is
00:40 - Reich uh through their
00:43 - API so um they have if you want to check
00:47 - out you know what I'm going to be
00:49 - looking at on my other screen Reich has
00:52 - uh documentation so it's uh
00:55 - developers. re.com
00:57 - uh so I'm going to paste that in the
01:01 - live
01:03 - chat just in case anybody's interested
01:06 - in checking it
01:12 - out hey Sebastian's back in the live
01:15 - chat good to have you back how you
01:28 - been
01:32 - all right and just to show if you see
01:35 - something like this this is the
01:36 - documentation that I'm that I'm going
01:38 - from so Reich has a
01:42 - um a rest API I've already set
01:47 - up all this stuff so we have the API key
01:51 - uh in the M file so you all of course
01:55 - won't have the API key uh but so this
02:01 - obviously is not going to work for you
02:02 - uh if you try to run
02:06 - this uh but that's what I'll be working
02:09 - with I'm not sure if there's a free plan
02:12 - on Reich or not um yeah I really don't
02:16 - know so I'm not sure if he'd be able to
02:18 - sign up for a free account to test it
02:28 - out all right cool
02:31 - last week Sebastian was working a
02:34 - concert and said 12 hours a day standing
02:38 - in the Sun
02:40 - so yeah cool now you can uh hang out
02:44 - inside and watch computer screen back to
02:46 - normal
02:48 - huh hey how's it going
02:54 - everybody oh cool Ocean's back too
02:58 - awesome
03:02 - all right so this is going to be a short
03:04 - stream today because I have a meeting at
03:06 - 300 PM eastern time uh so that is in
03:09 - less than an
03:11 - hour uh so I was kind of hoping that I
03:14 - wouldn't have the meeting uh I have kind
03:16 - of a standing meeting every Monday at 3
03:18 - p.m. but it often gets cancelled or
03:20 - postponed and things so I was hoping
03:22 - that would happen today but it
03:25 - didn't so probably we're going to do
03:28 - maybe like one commodo cycle of coding
03:31 - and then some questions uh question
03:34 - answer stuff and then I'll be done so uh
03:38 - this would be way shorter than normal
03:39 - but with more within the range that I
03:42 - always kind of shoot for Which is less
03:44 - than an hour uh I never seem to
03:46 - accomplish that so I'm not going to go
03:49 - over uh any of the code that's that's
03:52 - changed to the pool requests um
03:57 - so I think we had four pool requests
03:59 - over the weekend all from Kevin so thank
04:03 - you so much Kevin you can check out if
04:05 - you go to the repo and you go under pool
04:08 - request look at the close request and
04:10 - the last four so it'll be I think the
04:13 - last one was number
04:15 - 30 uh so just look at the last four and
04:19 - uh you can check it out so you'll see
04:21 - the only thing that I'm going to point
04:23 - out because it it may be helpful is we
04:25 - have an example file now for a EnV so
04:28 - obviously uh the normal. N file is not
04:31 - going to be saved because that's where
04:33 - all the API keys are so we don't want to
04:36 - share those uh so this is here just to
04:39 - let you know what should be in that file
04:42 - just give you some
04:44 - examples and I'll have to add to this
04:46 - because I've I've added a few things in
04:48 - which obviously Kevin couldn't see
04:51 - because it was in my uh n file so that
04:54 - might be useful just so you kind of see
04:56 - how it how it should be set
04:58 - up this is actually much more orderly
05:01 - than
05:04 - mine okay and uh I have my I actually
05:08 - have my n file open on my other screen
05:10 - to make sure that I don't
05:13 - accidentally look at it uh and then have
05:16 - to go change all my
05:18 - keys uh but we'll be working today
05:21 - mainly just in server
05:23 - JS uh yeah I don't think we have to do
05:26 - anything in the service request Js while
05:29 - so I'm going to move this over a bit
05:32 - make this bigger uh I'm even going to
05:35 - hide that since we won't need it so let
05:38 - me show you what I've been working
05:40 - on uh really not haven't done much this
05:44 - morning um I caught up on checking out
05:47 - the pool requests merging them
05:50 - emails uh it's kind of a sluggish
05:53 - morning I still feel a bit sluggish I'm
05:55 - not sure I hope I'm not getting sick or
05:57 - anything I just have haven't made been
05:59 - able to shake off just sleepiness from
06:02 - this
06:03 - morning uh but so here's what I've
06:07 - done uh I've made well in mym file I've
06:12 - I've
06:12 - put I think all the things that I'll
06:15 - need to get the Reich API working so the
06:18 - URL that I need to hit the um the API
06:22 - key and then some IDs for uh for people
06:26 - that we have in the system so I I want
06:30 - the way the Reich API works
06:34 - is anything that ha anything that I do
06:37 - through the API is registered to my
06:40 - account so it will show up like I'll be
06:43 - the owner of any projects that get
06:45 - created or tasks but I want our project
06:49 - manager to actually have access to that
06:51 - and be able to have do whatever uh she
06:54 - wants with it so I need her
06:57 - ID and I need to put put that in so
07:00 - you'll see when I when I go to send this
07:02 - this first request to test it out uh you
07:04 - won't be able to see her ID but cuz it's
07:06 - in the as an environment variable but
07:09 - you'll see where I need to have uh that
07:11 - ID in there so for the first step we're
07:14 - just going to try to send something I'm
07:17 - not even going to try to pull in the
07:19 - real data I'm just going to send
07:21 - something uh just to make sure that it's
07:25 - working uh and then after that we can
07:27 - try to send real data from the form and
07:31 - we can also
07:33 - send the files so that'll be tricky I'm
07:36 - not sure if we'll have enough time to
07:37 - get to that because we have to wait for
07:39 - a
07:40 - return from the
07:42 - API uh and that'll give us the ID of the
07:45 - project and then we'll use that to
07:46 - attach the files to
07:58 - it
08:01 - okay wow Sebastian
08:04 - says was trying to sync uh his fork with
08:08 - the repo but when I commit it keeps
08:10 - failing test manage to bypass the test
08:13 - and push but
08:14 - still okay is anybody else having issues
08:17 - like
08:20 - that if you are let me know oh
08:26 - um yeah I don't know I mean maybe send
08:28 - me
08:29 - send me a screenshot of if there's if
08:33 - there's any messages when you fail the
08:35 - tests or anything and uh maybe I'll have
08:37 - to talk to um maybe I have to talk to
08:40 - Kevin about it as well because he's been
08:42 - setting up the test and I've been trying
08:43 - to learn as much as I can from what he's
08:46 - doing uh but he'd probably know better
08:51 - than I would uh since he he set the test
08:58 - up
08:59 - okay Patrick says it's the
09:03 - timeouts
09:05 - okay okay good to know uh well maybe
09:11 - then okay maybe uh I'll have to check
09:14 - those out then okay
09:20 - cool all
09:23 - right okay let me get some code let me
09:26 - do at least one Pomodoro cycle and then
09:28 - I'll go back to the chat and
09:32 - um and then uh I'll answer all the
09:35 - questions and everything okay so let me
09:40 - reset all right so all I'm doing now is
09:45 - uh I'm going to send a post request uh
09:47 - to the API so I just need to put in
09:50 - everything necessary for
09:52 - that request uh to go through so let me
09:57 - see I have okay so on my other screen I
10:01 - have the current request that I'm
10:03 - sending from the live version of this uh
10:06 - with
10:07 - Ajax and I'm not going to put it on my
10:11 - screen because it has the the keys and
10:13 - everything in it you know just in plain
10:16 - text so I'm just going to actually going
10:19 - to have to type it
10:21 - up uh because I don't um I don't want to
10:25 - copy over the
10:27 - keys so
10:30 - let's see for the
10:35 - body I don't I guess I don't really need
10:38 - to
10:41 - put put anything right
10:46 - now uh actually maybe I maybe I
10:52 - will I might have to do this in a
10:55 - particular in a particular way okay so
10:59 - let's
11:13 - try so a lot of this stuff if you're
11:16 - watching and and you're kind of not
11:17 - familiar with doing things like this a
11:20 - lot of this is not going to be necessary
11:21 - every time you make an API call
11:24 - somewhere uh it's just this particular
11:26 - API requires things to be uh in this
11:30 - format so just don't want to don't want
11:32 - to mislead anybody to think you have to
11:34 - have all of this uh to do a a
11:55 - post okay so this where this description
11:58 - is this this is where our form data is
12:00 - going to actually
12:05 - go which for now we're just going to
12:07 - test it with just a
12:12 - string
12:19 - oops okay now this is where we're going
12:22 - to need to put the ID and it needs to be
12:26 - it's a weird format so
12:29 - so it needs to be an
12:32 - array actually let's see how we're going
12:34 - to do this I think I'm going to use a
12:37 - um a template
12:45 - literal yeah this I had trouble with
12:48 - this when I first when I was trying to
12:50 - get this to work before so this is going
12:51 - to look really weird uh but this is what
12:54 - ended up working for me so hopefully we
12:57 - can maybe clean it up AIT bit but for
12:59 - now just uh I I realize that this is
13:02 - going to be
13:27 - weird
13:35 - actually maybe I can get I think I might
13:38 - be able to get rid of those first
13:41 - ones
13:50 - okay okay when I type process.env that's
13:54 - going to let me access whatever
13:56 - variables I have saved in that EnV file
14:00 - uh so always you know it has to be
14:02 - process M and then after that it's
14:03 - whatever name I wanted to give it
14:05 - so I don't remember what name I gave
14:08 - this so I need to check what was
14:11 - it right share
14:17 - ID okay so this is going to
14:22 - be uh the
14:27 - ID the user user ID of the person that I
14:31 - want to share this project
14:36 - with and
14:38 - then we're also
14:40 - have
14:46 - project
14:47 - and we're going to create the project
14:54 - with let's
14:57 - see
15:26 - all right so almost done with this this
15:27 - is probably going to be be like the most
15:29 - tedious boring part of this I'm almost
15:38 - done okay I think I'm done I think
15:41 - that's all I need for
15:44 - now uh at least in this part okay
15:46 - everything else is going to make a
15:48 - little bit more sense but this was like
15:50 - I said very unique to uh the Reich
15:54 - API uh so anyway one of these things in
15:58 - a very specific way so this is what
16:02 - ended up working so hopefully I copy
16:05 - that over correctly uh I need to add
16:11 - headers so let's see we have the URL
16:16 - method body yeah I need headers and then
16:19 - our API key is going to go into
16:23 - uh the
16:25 - headers
16:27 - so
16:32 - Let's see we just we need a
16:46 - bearer
16:57 - authorization
17:04 - okay and uh if you're not sure what's
17:05 - going on with these dollar signs uh I'm
17:08 - not using jQuery this is template
17:10 - literal syntax uh so when I use these
17:13 - little back ticks uh it's a string just
17:17 - like if I was using you know quotation
17:20 - marks but then within the string I can
17:22 - do dollar sign curly uh bracket and then
17:25 - I can put Javascript within there okay
17:28 - so instead of adding a lot of plus signs
17:30 - and concatenating everything we can do
17:33 - it like
17:35 - that and for this one I'm going to need
17:39 - my last whoops forgot
17:44 - this I'm sure you all saw that I'm not
17:46 - even going to look at the live chat
17:48 - right now
17:50 - because I'm sure it's full of
17:53 - people saying that I forgot
17:57 - it
18:00 - okay and here's where our API key
18:05 - goes okay let me do one last check make
18:10 - sure I got
18:14 - everything I think that's it I think
18:16 - that's all that I
18:18 - um this is all I was
18:21 - sending uh in the other version of this
18:25 - uh so and it's working there
18:30 - all right so let's save that and for now
18:35 - it it has everything I don't really have
18:37 - to pass anything in
18:39 - here
18:41 - um so let's just have it
18:44 - [Music]
18:50 - run uh when we submit something
18:56 - so let's see
19:00 - so we'll do it down here below where
19:01 - we're doing
19:12 - emails uh so let's
19:17 - do I don't remember what I named
19:21 - this send
19:27 - re
19:33 - and I guess I'm not going to pass
19:37 - any yeah I don't really need any data in
19:40 - there right now let's see so let's see
19:42 - what
19:44 - happens and I think I have everything on
19:47 - my other screen right now let me find
19:57 - it
20:03 - I'm not sure where there it
20:04 - is have a lot of stuff
20:08 - okay uh let me just refresh to clear
20:11 - some of this I don't really need
20:12 - anything in here so let's submit and I'm
20:17 - going to
20:21 - check I have my the project
20:27 - management uh system
20:30 - open on my other screen and I'm not
20:34 - going to be able to show it because I'm
20:36 - pretty sure that um my bosses would not
20:40 - want me showing all of our projects and
20:42 - the comments on all of our projects on
20:43 - the screen so I'm just going to verify
20:46 - on the other screen that this
20:51 - sent and let's
20:55 - see what would now I gota see what would
20:59 - I name this it would have came out
21:06 - as okay
21:21 - test so could
21:27 - probably
21:40 - all right so I'm not I don't think it
21:42 - worked occasionally it does take a
21:45 - minute for this to show up so I'll check
21:47 - one more
21:53 - time okay yeah so I don't think it
21:57 - worked
21:59 - um yeah Patrick I know I'm I'm hitting
22:02 - uh 9,000 and the problem was just uh if
22:06 - you remember I have that Coors eror on
22:08 - 3000 and I never I never fixed that I
22:11 - actually I checked into the uh
22:13 - plugin uh that someone I can't remember
22:16 - who it was but someone had recommended a
22:18 - plugin uh for Chrome to get rid of the
22:20 - cores error stuff uh I checked it out
22:23 - and um it looked like for some people it
22:25 - worked great and for other people it it
22:28 - messed things up like YouTube wouldn't
22:30 - work for them or just all kind of
22:32 - different Services wouldn't work for
22:33 - them and since I'm running YouTube to do
22:36 - the stream while I'm doing this I didn't
22:39 - want to add the plugin so what I think
22:41 - I'm going to do maybe is
22:43 - um
22:45 - uh if I need to test it I'll just test
22:47 - it on 9,000 or I guess I could do 3,000
22:51 - on Firefox since it works
22:54 - there um but I shouldn't need I mean as
22:57 - soon as as we have this working I
23:00 - shouldn't really need to test it out
23:01 - anymore so it really won't be a big deal
23:03 - I can just run everything off of 3,000
23:05 - but for now it just seemed like uh just
23:09 - easier just to do it you know for the
23:11 - few times that we'll need to test it I
23:13 - mean probably only be working with this
23:14 - another day or two uh and then we'll
23:17 - just move on to styling everything uh
23:21 - and adding in the the proper
23:25 - content Okay so let
23:29 - me actually let me see if I have
23:31 - anything in the
23:35 - console I want to try to do
23:50 - this no
23:56 - not
24:01 - okay let me
24:23 - see all right let's see what response
24:25 - we're
24:26 - getting
24:44 - okay I forgot to uh mention I do have
24:49 - the Instagram stream going as well and
24:50 - if you are watching right now on
24:52 - Instagram and you want to see the code
24:53 - check out the free code Camp YouTube
24:55 - channel and then you can see what's
24:57 - going on on my screen
25:04 - screen all right I'm just copying over
25:07 - uh some of what's in the
25:10 - um the documentation for node
25:26 - fetch
25:38 - okay let's give it a
25:45 - shot okay so oh I didn't let me bring
25:50 - this over so yall can see what I'm
25:52 - seeing here so I didn't sorry I didn't
25:55 - realize it I kept looking over to check
25:58 - the uh the console to see what was
26:00 - happening uh
26:03 - so our parameter title is required and
26:06 - it's an invalided invalid parameter so
26:09 - let's check it out so we have
26:11 - title
26:14 - and it's telling me test is
26:26 - invalid
26:28 - all right let's see what I'm currently
26:33 - sending currently I'm just sending a
26:35 - string that's an email address uh as the
26:49 - title
26:56 - okay
27:01 - actually let me check did I bring over
27:03 - the
27:05 - [Music]
27:06 - documentation I think I pulled it back
27:08 - to the other screen
27:10 - uh let's
27:14 - see okay on the in the documentation it
27:17 - does say that it needs a title but the
27:23 - title
27:25 - uh can be a string
27:28 - and that's that's what we're sending
27:30 - right
27:43 - now that's the response we're
27:50 - getting create folder that's what I
27:53 - want okay it's still still a
27:56 - string
28:02 - so this
28:03 - is an example formatted poorly of what I
28:07 - what I actually need to
28:11 - send
28:20 - okay
28:26 - title yeah they're even using test is
28:29 - the title so what am I doing
28:39 - wrong I'm doing something
28:56 - wrong
29:15 - oh cool Patrick says Reich is free for
29:17 - up to five users so if anyone uh really
29:20 - wanted to try out Reich and get get an
29:23 - API key uh I guess you could
29:28 - I'm not sure if the API is available for
29:30 - the free version or not hopefully it
29:33 - is all right so
29:36 - I'm I'm really not sure what the problem
29:42 - is let me
29:45 - bring all right I'm going to show you
29:47 - all what the settings are uh that I'm
29:53 - currently uh
29:56 - sending
30:10 - h on all right yeah let me I'm going to
30:13 - need to clean it up a
30:15 - bit meaning take out all the stuff
30:20 - that the API keys and then I'll I'll
30:23 - show you
30:26 - all
30:41 - okay okay let me show
30:51 - you all right so here's using Ajax these
30:55 - are my settings uh that are working
30:58 - anywhere that it's you see that it's
30:59 - blank that's where um was something
31:02 - that's now an environment variable so
31:06 - just assume that I did have the right
31:07 - thing in
31:08 - there uh so this is the area right right
31:12 - here where we're having trouble and you
31:14 - know this variable for email was just a
31:16 - string with someone's email address in
31:19 - it so you can see I've attempted to
31:22 - replicate
31:26 - everything
31:29 - well pretty much everything I left out a
31:31 - few
31:32 - things I just wanted to see if it worked
31:34 - without it
31:38 - um yeah but see basically what I'm
31:42 - wondering
31:46 - about is if I'm
31:48 - simply missing something between the
31:52 - difference between using Ajax to send
31:54 - this and using fetch to send this
31:58 - if I'm missing something or formatting
32:00 - it
32:03 - wrong although based on the error it
32:06 - does seem
32:07 - like I mean let's show this error again
32:10 - as
32:11 - well I mean it seems like it's hitting
32:14 - the
32:15 - API in because we're getting this
32:18 - description back of title is
32:21 - required uh and it's
32:25 - invalid uh so
32:29 - so
32:30 - anyway I'm basically just not really
32:32 - sure what to do from here so I'm going
32:35 - to give you all just a minute to check
32:37 - that
32:40 - out and see if you have any
32:44 - ideas now now that this is happening I
32:47 - remember it's all coming back to me now
32:49 - I remember working with this API before
32:53 - and having a lot of trial and error uh
32:56 - of trying to get this to
33:12 - work I mean the the biggest difference
33:15 - that I see and I'm not really sure why
33:17 - it would make a difference maybe it
33:19 - wouldn't at all is uh I'm using double
33:23 - quotes everywhere over here and single
33:25 - quotes here and the only reason I even
33:27 - thought of that is I know at least in
33:29 - Json you have to use double quotes um is
33:34 - it possible that that's my
33:40 - issue okay so uh wolf says maybe you
33:43 - need uh to escape the quotes on
33:55 - title yeah let me
34:03 - see I'm
34:16 - not or send something is
34:24 - like uh yeah so the fet are making this
34:28 - easy to read objects in Jon
34:42 - string okay so Patrick says try making
34:45 - those easy to read objects and then Json
34:47 - stringify
34:49 - them I got three they're all in here
34:52 - thank you all right
34:55 - so Bas so Patrick you're saying this
34:59 - part should then be an
35:02 - object that's stringified and then I
35:04 - just pass it
35:09 - in obviously in the same
35:19 - spot or just this part
35:21 - then yeah I think it's you're talking
35:23 - about just this
35:25 - part okay
35:28 - all right cool thank
35:42 - you all right so let's
35:55 - make
36:19 - okay so
36:23 - temporarily we're going to do this
36:32 - I'll all right have a good
36:55 - one
37:11 - okay okay Gavin says that um it's
37:15 - recommended to stringify the body so
37:18 - okay so let's try
37:21 - that I'm sure youall let me know if I
37:23 - did this wrong but we'll give it a try
37:25 - and actually this will probably be or
37:26 - last try whether or not it works uh
37:28 - because my timer is definitely gone up a
37:31 - few minutes ago uh and I want to make
37:33 - sure that I get to your questions uh at
37:36 - least as many as I can before my
37:40 - meeting
37:50 - uh same
37:55 - thing
37:57 - all right let's
38:25 - see
38:35 - all right now I said that was going to
38:36 - be it I'm not going to try anything
38:39 - else
38:41 - um okay Patrick says now get rid of the
38:44 - template
38:49 - literals may need to remove the
38:55 - quotes
39:04 - okay uh let me see what time is it yeah
39:08 - let me answer some questions and uh I'll
39:10 - work on this more later on uh
39:16 - so actually so um Gavin asked is the API
39:20 - expecting the title to be an email no I
39:22 - I don't think so I think it could be
39:24 - well based on the documentation
39:28 - so we had it up on the screen what' I do
39:30 - with it so based on the
39:33 - documentation uh it it's just a string
39:39 - so the only it just can't be empty uh
39:42 - but we just need a
39:44 - string so I mean according to that I
39:47 - mean that's that would
39:53 - work so I mean the these are the
39:55 - parameters that we
40:03 - need and we have so basically this is we
40:07 - just need Title really all this other
40:09 - stuff we don't even need yet uh just to
40:12 - test
40:20 - it
40:24 - folder yeah
40:34 - all right we'll have to
40:36 - try either later on today or uh tomorrow
40:41 - morning I'll try out just all kind of
40:44 - different stuff and see what works uh
40:46 - that's what I had to do the last
40:51 - time don't have quotes on the
40:55 - PRS
41:01 - okay let
41:02 - me uh
41:04 - MFC I'm going to copy your uh the link
41:07 - that you posted in there and I'm going
41:09 - to check that out uh after my meeting
41:12 - probably not after I'll probably have to
41:13 - leave right after my meeting so I'll
41:15 - have to work on this tomorrow
41:20 - morning oh okay remove the quotes from
41:23 - let me try this one
41:25 - thing
41:33 - then actually
41:36 - this this might be the
41:39 - problem and this might this will fix the
41:42 - problem
41:44 - maybe it makes sense I probably don't
41:47 - have to refresh this but I'm just
41:50 - like why not I was doing it before to
41:53 - clear out the fields but now I'm not
41:54 - even using them
42:05 - really want to make sure that this is
42:07 - actually
42:09 - running okay it is yeah and we're still
42:13 - not
42:22 - shoot
42:23 - [Music]
42:25 - yeah all right one
42:28 - more we'll try double
42:33 - quotes let's just see it's possible it's
42:36 - possible they're looking for double
42:42 - quotes yeah parameter title was required
42:47 - parameter yeah
42:48 - maybe maybe I I kind of think now that
42:52 - it's something like maybe I'm
42:55 - not
43:00 - yeah I'll check it
43:02 - out and uh the problem at least I've
43:05 - seen with the Reich API the only thing I
43:06 - don't like about it is it doesn't seem
43:08 - that there's that many people using it
43:10 - because I can't find a lot at least when
43:12 - I worked with it before I couldn't find
43:14 - a lot like on stack Overflow about it so
43:17 - I'll try to look it up tomorrow morning
43:19 - and see if somebody's had similar issues
43:22 - but I'm not really hopeful that I'll
43:24 - find something uh so I don't know what
43:26 - it is if it's just a not not a popular
43:29 - system or people just don't use the API
43:32 - I'm not sure uh but I'm going to check
43:35 - out uh the the links and I'm going
43:40 - to try out the I know there are other uh
43:43 - suggestions and things uh in the live
43:45 - chat so I'm going to check all that out
43:48 - and let me go through now and just see
43:52 - what questions if you have any questions
43:53 - for me uh put them in the um live chat
43:56 - now probably can only take about 10
43:58 - minutes of questions
44:05 - today yeah okay I just saw wolf that's
44:08 - exactly what I was thinking uh wolf says
44:11 - it sounds like it's not receiving the
44:12 - data section at all that yeah that was
44:15 - my last thought uh after we after we
44:20 - tried to double quote so I I thought
44:23 - maybe it's just not getting this uh
44:26 - because it yeah so it's possible that's
44:32 - I don't know that's what I'm going to
44:33 - check into is is it getting this at all
44:35 - and if not why
44:42 - not okay so I'm going to scroll back up
44:45 - see if I missed any
44:46 - questions and this feels so Rush since
44:50 - I've been doing like 2hour long uh shows
44:53 - lately but this is actually longer than
44:55 - I I originally was doing half hour
44:58 - streams now thinking about it I'm like
45:01 - how did I get anything done in a half an
45:03 - hour but when I started sometimes there
45:06 - was maybe like nobody watching or just
45:08 - one person so the the question answer
45:10 - sessions were a lot
45:23 - shorter uh Hamed says demo deployment on
45:26 - Heroku might help a newcomer like me uh
45:30 - yeah actually can I deploy
45:33 - this yeah maybe I could try to deploy
45:37 - this I think you can deploy create react
45:40 - app stuff on GitHub
45:43 - pages that would probably be the
45:47 - easiest yeah I'll have to think about
45:52 - that oh also I didn't fire up the uh the
45:55 - enro server today and that was actually
45:57 - on
45:58 - purpose um so I was thinking and correct
46:02 - me if I'm
46:03 - wrong if I ran this on enro
46:08 - and someone tried to use the file
46:11 - uploader they could potentially upload
46:13 - files to my local machine
46:16 - correct so if that's
46:19 - correct uh and especially since we don't
46:22 - have any type of security set up to like
46:24 - check the file type or
46:26 - anything uh then I'm probably not going
46:29 - to run enro while we're working on this
46:32 - and then once we get it working I'll
46:34 - just disable it and then run enrock and
46:37 - work on the rest of the
46:53 - site uh Sean says keep the videos please
46:56 - I'm catching up awesome uh yeah I'll
47:00 - definitely definitely keep doing the
47:02 - videos uh and they'll they'll be
47:04 - available on free code Camp's
47:13 - Channel okay Sebastian I saw that you
47:16 - just now that you shared uh a link to
47:18 - the photo I'm guessing of the error
47:21 - errors that you're
47:22 - getting
47:24 - um
47:27 - so I'll check that out and try to get it
47:29 - all
47:32 - um I'll try to get that working uh with
47:36 - the
47:38 - test this is too bad I think um it
47:41 - doesn't seem like Kevin is watching
47:44 - today uh so I was hoping to be able to
47:46 - ask him about
47:50 - it uh Peter says thank you so much for
47:53 - what you're doing you're welcome thanks
47:55 - for watching
48:24 - in
48:50 - okay going through almost to the bottom
48:51 - there's actually not very many
48:54 - questions
49:14 - okay I see Gavin I see your comment now
49:16 - about using curl just to check to see
49:18 - that the API works so the API is working
49:21 - so I have it I have it running basically
49:25 - this
49:26 - this but in the form of I'm using Ajax
49:29 - instead of fetch so I have that running
49:32 - uh on the live version of this site and
49:35 - it
49:36 - works uh so I know the API Works uh I
49:42 - get we get submissions on it every
49:45 - day uh so
49:48 - that's uh that's definitely
49:54 - working
50:18 - uh Matthew asked what is he doing
50:21 - exactly uh Patrick uh had a good answer
50:24 - basically I'm trying to integrate with
50:25 - the project management API yeah that's
50:28 - that is what I'm trying to
50:33 - do the uh the project management system
50:35 - is called
50:49 - Reich Okay evan says you could try
50:51 - double quotes on the Pam names maybe uh
50:54 - because I had that in the settings on
50:56 - the right yeah actually that I did have
50:58 - that in the settings so
51:02 - um yeah I'll have to try that
51:16 - next oh okay so wolf says what if it has
51:20 - to be something like this and let me
51:21 - show you I'm going to copy and paste
51:23 - this over so wol saying what about
51:26 - something like that so body and then
51:29 - data Json stringify test
51:33 - body
51:35 - um yeah
51:38 - maybe I want to see
51:43 - how if this was in a
51:49 - field
51:54 - actually
51:56 - maybe that'll
52:07 - work yeah I'll have to try
52:24 - that
52:29 - uh erery 33 says love the stream and all
52:32 - that FCC free code Camp does are we able
52:35 - to create our own streams uh SLV videos
52:38 - about free code Camp as well uh you can
52:41 - certainly do it um on your own channel
52:44 - uh if you wanted to be able to stream on
52:46 - free code camps Channel or do videos
52:48 - then uh I would get in touch with
52:52 - Quincy um so Quincy is uh at freecode
52:56 - camp on Twitter uh he runs that Twitter
52:59 - um or I'm sure you can get uh on the
53:02 - freec Cod Camp website there's a page
53:04 - where you can get contact info for all
53:06 - the different people that are in charge
53:08 - of various things I'm in charge of
53:10 - nothing except my own stream so uh I
53:13 - can't uh give any permission uh to
53:15 - anyone uh to do videos but you can
53:18 - certainly ask about it and see um if if
53:22 - that's a
53:24 - possibility
53:34 - okay Gavin says I think I'll try to
53:36 - follow along with you using my company's
53:38 - project management jira I have to start
53:40 - from day one though yeah um that's cool
53:44 - I'd love to hear how that goes so keep
53:46 - keep me up to date on how everything's
53:47 - going for you Gavin
53:50 - um yeah there's a lot to catch up on
53:53 - once we get into a project I always know
53:55 - noticed that uh the view count so day
53:58 - one of a project always has like by far
54:00 - the most views and like every day after
54:03 - that it seems like it drops a little bit
54:06 - occasionally depending on what I'm
54:07 - working on I guess it it will fluctuate
54:11 - but the the farther I get in like less
54:15 - and less people make it that far to
54:17 - catch up with everything
54:20 - so um like I think day one for this
54:22 - project has like over 12,000 views now
54:25 - and then the last one we did on Friday
54:28 - has maybe like 1,200 views so it's
54:34 - uh I guess try to get through I know who
54:37 - is it I don't know if Bill's still in
54:38 - here but Bill's will watch sometimes on
54:41 - like four times speed you're able to
54:42 - watch it
54:43 - on which is crazy I wonder how I sound
54:46 - on four times
54:54 - speed
54:59 - oh okay Patrick says Json stringify is
55:01 - handling making uh valid Json with
55:03 - double quotes so it shouldn't matter
55:05 - what I'm doing with the quotes because
55:06 - it should be formatted
55:15 - correctly oh okay cool good idea Gavin
55:19 - let me just write this in here now so I
55:21 - don't
55:23 - forget uh
55:26 - actually I'm just I won't have time I
55:27 - got to go to my meeting in like two
55:29 - minutes so um I'm going to paste that
55:32 - right here so that I don't
55:34 - forget and I'll leave this up on my
55:36 - screen when I leave today so when I log
55:39 - in when I come to work tomorrow I turn
55:41 - uh I never really turned off my computer
55:43 - but when
55:45 - I uh when I log in and this shows up uh
55:48 - then I will remember and I will try it
55:54 - out
56:04 - all right let's see okay wolf says uh
56:07 - the 2hour length on the video is
56:08 - somewhat intimidating this is the first
56:10 - one I'm watching oh welcome uh thanks
56:13 - for watching um yeah I know the length
56:16 - is is intimidating um I
56:20 - had I don't know at various times I try
56:23 - to get it short to be shorter but seems
56:26 - like we'll be working on something and I
56:29 - just want to get it done so we'll keep
56:30 - going or even if I get something the
56:34 - coding portion done you know relatively
56:37 - you know kind of on time then I'll have
56:39 - a lot of questions so if I really wanted
56:43 - I'm not really that worried about it if
56:44 - I wanted to be more disciplined I guess
56:46 - I would just cut it off at a certain
56:47 - time and even if I didn't get to all the
56:49 - questions and I may have to do that you
56:52 - know if there's enough people watching
56:53 - and asking questions at some point I'll
56:55 - just have to cut it off CU I you know I
56:57 - wouldn't be able to answer it to be
56:59 - hours and hours so uh we'll see I do I
57:02 - think I definitely want to start getting
57:04 - it back down towards the 1 hour and not
57:06 - go over two hours
57:09 - anymore
57:10 - so um anyway but I I'll take that in
57:13 - consideration because I've gotten
57:15 - similar uh comments about the length is
57:18 - just it's just really
57:23 - long
57:35 - okay let's
57:38 - see hey Kevin's here how's it
57:48 - going uh okay wolf wolf says I think
57:51 - it's excellent that they are that long
57:52 - just think it has something to do with
57:54 - your view counts yeah yeah you're
58:00 - right all right so I yeah I have two
58:03 - minutes until my meeting starts so I
58:05 - definitely have to go uh if you do have
58:07 - any questions just send them to me on
58:08 - Twitter put them in the comments of the
58:09 - video I'll try to get to him as soon as
58:11 - I can thank you so much uh for watching
58:13 - today and for helping me out sorry we
58:15 - couldn't actually get anything
58:17 - accomplished uh but hopefully I can get
58:19 - it all sorted out tomorrow morning and
58:21 - then show you uh how I got it to work
58:25 - for tomorrow's video I think 2:00
58:27 - tomorrow will work uh so I will see you
58:30 - then have a great
58:34 - day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody it's Jesse and um I hope you all had a good uh good weekend today we're going to keep working on our server uh. JS file so last week we with at least at the end of last week uh we got our file uploads working and we also got the emails working uh with sand grid so the next step is to send data to our project management system which is Reich uh through their API so um they have if you want to check out you know what I'm going to be looking at on my other screen Reich has uh documentation so it's uh developers. re.com uh so I'm going to paste that in the live chat just in case anybody's interested in checking it out hey Sebastian's back in the live chat good to have you back how you been all right and just to show if you see something like this this is the documentation that I'm that I'm going from so Reich has a um a rest API I've already set up all this stuff so we have the API key uh in the M file so you all of course won't have the API key uh but so this obviously is not going to work for you uh if you try to run this uh but that's what I'll be working with I'm not sure if there's a free plan on Reich or not um yeah I really don't know so I'm not sure if he'd be able to sign up for a free account to test it out all right cool last week Sebastian was working a concert and said 12 hours a day standing in the Sun so yeah cool now you can uh hang out inside and watch computer screen back to normal huh hey how's it going everybody oh cool Ocean's back too awesome all right so this is going to be a short stream today because I have a meeting at 300 PM eastern time uh so that is in less than an hour uh so I was kind of hoping that I wouldn't have the meeting uh I have kind of a standing meeting every Monday at 3 p.m. but it often gets cancelled or postponed and things so I was hoping that would happen today but it didn't so probably we're going to do maybe like one commodo cycle of coding and then some questions uh question answer stuff and then I'll be done so uh this would be way shorter than normal but with more within the range that I always kind of shoot for Which is less than an hour uh I never seem to accomplish that so I'm not going to go over uh any of the code that's that's changed to the pool requests um so I think we had four pool requests over the weekend all from Kevin so thank you so much Kevin you can check out if you go to the repo and you go under pool request look at the close request and the last four so it'll be I think the last one was number 30 uh so just look at the last four and uh you can check it out so you'll see the only thing that I'm going to point out because it it may be helpful is we have an example file now for a EnV so obviously uh the normal. N file is not going to be saved because that's where all the API keys are so we don't want to share those uh so this is here just to let you know what should be in that file just give you some examples and I'll have to add to this because I've I've added a few things in which obviously Kevin couldn't see because it was in my uh n file so that might be useful just so you kind of see how it how it should be set up this is actually much more orderly than mine okay and uh I have my I actually have my n file open on my other screen to make sure that I don't accidentally look at it uh and then have to go change all my keys uh but we'll be working today mainly just in server JS uh yeah I don't think we have to do anything in the service request Js while so I'm going to move this over a bit make this bigger uh I'm even going to hide that since we won't need it so let me show you what I've been working on uh really not haven't done much this morning um I caught up on checking out the pool requests merging them emails uh it's kind of a sluggish morning I still feel a bit sluggish I'm not sure I hope I'm not getting sick or anything I just have haven't made been able to shake off just sleepiness from this morning uh but so here's what I've done uh I've made well in mym file I've I've put I think all the things that I'll need to get the Reich API working so the URL that I need to hit the um the API key and then some IDs for uh for people that we have in the system so I I want the way the Reich API works is anything that ha anything that I do through the API is registered to my account so it will show up like I'll be the owner of any projects that get created or tasks but I want our project manager to actually have access to that and be able to have do whatever uh she wants with it so I need her ID and I need to put put that in so you'll see when I when I go to send this this first request to test it out uh you won't be able to see her ID but cuz it's in the as an environment variable but you'll see where I need to have uh that ID in there so for the first step we're just going to try to send something I'm not even going to try to pull in the real data I'm just going to send something uh just to make sure that it's working uh and then after that we can try to send real data from the form and we can also send the files so that'll be tricky I'm not sure if we'll have enough time to get to that because we have to wait for a return from the API uh and that'll give us the ID of the project and then we'll use that to attach the files to it okay wow Sebastian says was trying to sync uh his fork with the repo but when I commit it keeps failing test manage to bypass the test and push but still okay is anybody else having issues like that if you are let me know oh um yeah I don't know I mean maybe send me send me a screenshot of if there's if there's any messages when you fail the tests or anything and uh maybe I'll have to talk to um maybe I have to talk to Kevin about it as well because he's been setting up the test and I've been trying to learn as much as I can from what he's doing uh but he'd probably know better than I would uh since he he set the test up okay Patrick says it's the timeouts okay okay good to know uh well maybe then okay maybe uh I'll have to check those out then okay cool all right okay let me get some code let me do at least one Pomodoro cycle and then I'll go back to the chat and um and then uh I'll answer all the questions and everything okay so let me reset all right so all I'm doing now is uh I'm going to send a post request uh to the API so I just need to put in everything necessary for that request uh to go through so let me see I have okay so on my other screen I have the current request that I'm sending from the live version of this uh with Ajax and I'm not going to put it on my screen because it has the the keys and everything in it you know just in plain text so I'm just going to actually going to have to type it up uh because I don't um I don't want to copy over the keys so let's see for the body I don't I guess I don't really need to put put anything right now uh actually maybe I maybe I will I might have to do this in a particular in a particular way okay so let's try so a lot of this stuff if you're watching and and you're kind of not familiar with doing things like this a lot of this is not going to be necessary every time you make an API call somewhere uh it's just this particular API requires things to be uh in this format so just don't want to don't want to mislead anybody to think you have to have all of this uh to do a a post okay so this where this description is this this is where our form data is going to actually go which for now we're just going to test it with just a string oops okay now this is where we're going to need to put the ID and it needs to be it's a weird format so so it needs to be an array actually let's see how we're going to do this I think I'm going to use a um a template literal yeah this I had trouble with this when I first when I was trying to get this to work before so this is going to look really weird uh but this is what ended up working for me so hopefully we can maybe clean it up AIT bit but for now just uh I I realize that this is going to be weird actually maybe I can get I think I might be able to get rid of those first ones okay okay when I type process.env that's going to let me access whatever variables I have saved in that EnV file uh so always you know it has to be process M and then after that it's whatever name I wanted to give it so I don't remember what name I gave this so I need to check what was it right share ID okay so this is going to be uh the ID the user user ID of the person that I want to share this project with and then we're also have project and we're going to create the project with let's see all right so almost done with this this is probably going to be be like the most tedious boring part of this I'm almost done okay I think I'm done I think that's all I need for now uh at least in this part okay everything else is going to make a little bit more sense but this was like I said very unique to uh the Reich API uh so anyway one of these things in a very specific way so this is what ended up working so hopefully I copy that over correctly uh I need to add headers so let's see we have the URL method body yeah I need headers and then our API key is going to go into uh the headers so Let's see we just we need a bearer authorization okay and uh if you're not sure what's going on with these dollar signs uh I'm not using jQuery this is template literal syntax uh so when I use these little back ticks uh it's a string just like if I was using you know quotation marks but then within the string I can do dollar sign curly uh bracket and then I can put Javascript within there okay so instead of adding a lot of plus signs and concatenating everything we can do it like that and for this one I'm going to need my last whoops forgot this I'm sure you all saw that I'm not even going to look at the live chat right now because I'm sure it's full of people saying that I forgot it okay and here's where our API key goes okay let me do one last check make sure I got everything I think that's it I think that's all that I um this is all I was sending uh in the other version of this uh so and it's working there all right so let's save that and for now it it has everything I don't really have to pass anything in here um so let's just have it run uh when we submit something so let's see so we'll do it down here below where we're doing emails uh so let's do I don't remember what I named this send re and I guess I'm not going to pass any yeah I don't really need any data in there right now let's see so let's see what happens and I think I have everything on my other screen right now let me find it I'm not sure where there it is have a lot of stuff okay uh let me just refresh to clear some of this I don't really need anything in here so let's submit and I'm going to check I have my the project management uh system open on my other screen and I'm not going to be able to show it because I'm pretty sure that um my bosses would not want me showing all of our projects and the comments on all of our projects on the screen so I'm just going to verify on the other screen that this sent and let's see what would now I gota see what would I name this it would have came out as okay test so could probably all right so I'm not I don't think it worked occasionally it does take a minute for this to show up so I'll check one more time okay yeah so I don't think it worked um yeah Patrick I know I'm I'm hitting uh 9,000 and the problem was just uh if you remember I have that Coors eror on 3000 and I never I never fixed that I actually I checked into the uh plugin uh that someone I can't remember who it was but someone had recommended a plugin uh for Chrome to get rid of the cores error stuff uh I checked it out and um it looked like for some people it worked great and for other people it it messed things up like YouTube wouldn't work for them or just all kind of different Services wouldn't work for them and since I'm running YouTube to do the stream while I'm doing this I didn't want to add the plugin so what I think I'm going to do maybe is um uh if I need to test it I'll just test it on 9,000 or I guess I could do 3,000 on Firefox since it works there um but I shouldn't need I mean as soon as as we have this working I shouldn't really need to test it out anymore so it really won't be a big deal I can just run everything off of 3,000 but for now it just seemed like uh just easier just to do it you know for the few times that we'll need to test it I mean probably only be working with this another day or two uh and then we'll just move on to styling everything uh and adding in the the proper content Okay so let me actually let me see if I have anything in the console I want to try to do this no not okay let me see all right let's see what response we're getting okay I forgot to uh mention I do have the Instagram stream going as well and if you are watching right now on Instagram and you want to see the code check out the free code Camp YouTube channel and then you can see what's going on on my screen screen all right I'm just copying over uh some of what's in the um the documentation for node fetch okay let's give it a shot okay so oh I didn't let me bring this over so yall can see what I'm seeing here so I didn't sorry I didn't realize it I kept looking over to check the uh the console to see what was happening uh so our parameter title is required and it's an invalided invalid parameter so let's check it out so we have title and it's telling me test is invalid all right let's see what I'm currently sending currently I'm just sending a string that's an email address uh as the title okay actually let me check did I bring over the documentation I think I pulled it back to the other screen uh let's see okay on the in the documentation it does say that it needs a title but the title uh can be a string and that's that's what we're sending right now that's the response we're getting create folder that's what I want okay it's still still a string so this is an example formatted poorly of what I what I actually need to send okay title yeah they're even using test is the title so what am I doing wrong I'm doing something wrong oh cool Patrick says Reich is free for up to five users so if anyone uh really wanted to try out Reich and get get an API key uh I guess you could I'm not sure if the API is available for the free version or not hopefully it is all right so I'm I'm really not sure what the problem is let me bring all right I'm going to show you all what the settings are uh that I'm currently uh sending h on all right yeah let me I'm going to need to clean it up a bit meaning take out all the stuff that the API keys and then I'll I'll show you all okay okay let me show you all right so here's using Ajax these are my settings uh that are working anywhere that it's you see that it's blank that's where um was something that's now an environment variable so just assume that I did have the right thing in there uh so this is the area right right here where we're having trouble and you know this variable for email was just a string with someone's email address in it so you can see I've attempted to replicate everything well pretty much everything I left out a few things I just wanted to see if it worked without it um yeah but see basically what I'm wondering about is if I'm simply missing something between the difference between using Ajax to send this and using fetch to send this if I'm missing something or formatting it wrong although based on the error it does seem like I mean let's show this error again as well I mean it seems like it's hitting the API in because we're getting this description back of title is required uh and it's invalid uh so so anyway I'm basically just not really sure what to do from here so I'm going to give you all just a minute to check that out and see if you have any ideas now now that this is happening I remember it's all coming back to me now I remember working with this API before and having a lot of trial and error uh of trying to get this to work I mean the the biggest difference that I see and I'm not really sure why it would make a difference maybe it wouldn't at all is uh I'm using double quotes everywhere over here and single quotes here and the only reason I even thought of that is I know at least in Json you have to use double quotes um is it possible that that's my issue okay so uh wolf says maybe you need uh to escape the quotes on title yeah let me see I'm not or send something is like uh yeah so the fet are making this easy to read objects in Jon string okay so Patrick says try making those easy to read objects and then Json stringify them I got three they're all in here thank you all right so Bas so Patrick you're saying this part should then be an object that's stringified and then I just pass it in obviously in the same spot or just this part then yeah I think it's you're talking about just this part okay all right cool thank you all right so let's make okay so temporarily we're going to do this I'll all right have a good one okay okay Gavin says that um it's recommended to stringify the body so okay so let's try that I'm sure youall let me know if I did this wrong but we'll give it a try and actually this will probably be or last try whether or not it works uh because my timer is definitely gone up a few minutes ago uh and I want to make sure that I get to your questions uh at least as many as I can before my meeting uh same thing all right let's see all right now I said that was going to be it I'm not going to try anything else um okay Patrick says now get rid of the template literals may need to remove the quotes okay uh let me see what time is it yeah let me answer some questions and uh I'll work on this more later on uh so actually so um Gavin asked is the API expecting the title to be an email no I I don't think so I think it could be well based on the documentation so we had it up on the screen what' I do with it so based on the documentation uh it it's just a string so the only it just can't be empty uh but we just need a string so I mean according to that I mean that's that would work so I mean the these are the parameters that we need and we have so basically this is we just need Title really all this other stuff we don't even need yet uh just to test it folder yeah all right we'll have to try either later on today or uh tomorrow morning I'll try out just all kind of different stuff and see what works uh that's what I had to do the last time don't have quotes on the PRS okay let me uh MFC I'm going to copy your uh the link that you posted in there and I'm going to check that out uh after my meeting probably not after I'll probably have to leave right after my meeting so I'll have to work on this tomorrow morning oh okay remove the quotes from let me try this one thing then actually this this might be the problem and this might this will fix the problem maybe it makes sense I probably don't have to refresh this but I'm just like why not I was doing it before to clear out the fields but now I'm not even using them really want to make sure that this is actually running okay it is yeah and we're still not shoot yeah all right one more we'll try double quotes let's just see it's possible it's possible they're looking for double quotes yeah parameter title was required parameter yeah maybe maybe I I kind of think now that it's something like maybe I'm not yeah I'll check it out and uh the problem at least I've seen with the Reich API the only thing I don't like about it is it doesn't seem that there's that many people using it because I can't find a lot at least when I worked with it before I couldn't find a lot like on stack Overflow about it so I'll try to look it up tomorrow morning and see if somebody's had similar issues but I'm not really hopeful that I'll find something uh so I don't know what it is if it's just a not not a popular system or people just don't use the API I'm not sure uh but I'm going to check out uh the the links and I'm going to try out the I know there are other uh suggestions and things uh in the live chat so I'm going to check all that out and let me go through now and just see what questions if you have any questions for me uh put them in the um live chat now probably can only take about 10 minutes of questions today yeah okay I just saw wolf that's exactly what I was thinking uh wolf says it sounds like it's not receiving the data section at all that yeah that was my last thought uh after we after we tried to double quote so I I thought maybe it's just not getting this uh because it yeah so it's possible that's I don't know that's what I'm going to check into is is it getting this at all and if not why not okay so I'm going to scroll back up see if I missed any questions and this feels so Rush since I've been doing like 2hour long uh shows lately but this is actually longer than I I originally was doing half hour streams now thinking about it I'm like how did I get anything done in a half an hour but when I started sometimes there was maybe like nobody watching or just one person so the the question answer sessions were a lot shorter uh Hamed says demo deployment on Heroku might help a newcomer like me uh yeah actually can I deploy this yeah maybe I could try to deploy this I think you can deploy create react app stuff on GitHub pages that would probably be the easiest yeah I'll have to think about that oh also I didn't fire up the uh the enro server today and that was actually on purpose um so I was thinking and correct me if I'm wrong if I ran this on enro and someone tried to use the file uploader they could potentially upload files to my local machine correct so if that's correct uh and especially since we don't have any type of security set up to like check the file type or anything uh then I'm probably not going to run enro while we're working on this and then once we get it working I'll just disable it and then run enrock and work on the rest of the site uh Sean says keep the videos please I'm catching up awesome uh yeah I'll definitely definitely keep doing the videos uh and they'll they'll be available on free code Camp's Channel okay Sebastian I saw that you just now that you shared uh a link to the photo I'm guessing of the error errors that you're getting um so I'll check that out and try to get it all um I'll try to get that working uh with the test this is too bad I think um it doesn't seem like Kevin is watching today uh so I was hoping to be able to ask him about it uh Peter says thank you so much for what you're doing you're welcome thanks for watching in okay going through almost to the bottom there's actually not very many questions okay I see Gavin I see your comment now about using curl just to check to see that the API works so the API is working so I have it I have it running basically this this but in the form of I'm using Ajax instead of fetch so I have that running uh on the live version of this site and it works uh so I know the API Works uh I get we get submissions on it every day uh so that's uh that's definitely working uh Matthew asked what is he doing exactly uh Patrick uh had a good answer basically I'm trying to integrate with the project management API yeah that's that is what I'm trying to do the uh the project management system is called Reich Okay evan says you could try double quotes on the Pam names maybe uh because I had that in the settings on the right yeah actually that I did have that in the settings so um yeah I'll have to try that next oh okay so wolf says what if it has to be something like this and let me show you I'm going to copy and paste this over so wol saying what about something like that so body and then data Json stringify test body um yeah maybe I want to see how if this was in a field actually maybe that'll work yeah I'll have to try that uh erery 33 says love the stream and all that FCC free code Camp does are we able to create our own streams uh SLV videos about free code Camp as well uh you can certainly do it um on your own channel uh if you wanted to be able to stream on free code camps Channel or do videos then uh I would get in touch with Quincy um so Quincy is uh at freecode camp on Twitter uh he runs that Twitter um or I'm sure you can get uh on the freec Cod Camp website there's a page where you can get contact info for all the different people that are in charge of various things I'm in charge of nothing except my own stream so uh I can't uh give any permission uh to anyone uh to do videos but you can certainly ask about it and see um if if that's a possibility okay Gavin says I think I'll try to follow along with you using my company's project management jira I have to start from day one though yeah um that's cool I'd love to hear how that goes so keep keep me up to date on how everything's going for you Gavin um yeah there's a lot to catch up on once we get into a project I always know noticed that uh the view count so day one of a project always has like by far the most views and like every day after that it seems like it drops a little bit occasionally depending on what I'm working on I guess it it will fluctuate but the the farther I get in like less and less people make it that far to catch up with everything so um like I think day one for this project has like over 12,000 views now and then the last one we did on Friday has maybe like 1,200 views so it's uh I guess try to get through I know who is it I don't know if Bill's still in here but Bill's will watch sometimes on like four times speed you're able to watch it on which is crazy I wonder how I sound on four times speed oh okay Patrick says Json stringify is handling making uh valid Json with double quotes so it shouldn't matter what I'm doing with the quotes because it should be formatted correctly oh okay cool good idea Gavin let me just write this in here now so I don't forget uh actually I'm just I won't have time I got to go to my meeting in like two minutes so um I'm going to paste that right here so that I don't forget and I'll leave this up on my screen when I leave today so when I log in when I come to work tomorrow I turn uh I never really turned off my computer but when I uh when I log in and this shows up uh then I will remember and I will try it out all right let's see okay wolf says uh the 2hour length on the video is somewhat intimidating this is the first one I'm watching oh welcome uh thanks for watching um yeah I know the length is is intimidating um I had I don't know at various times I try to get it short to be shorter but seems like we'll be working on something and I just want to get it done so we'll keep going or even if I get something the coding portion done you know relatively you know kind of on time then I'll have a lot of questions so if I really wanted I'm not really that worried about it if I wanted to be more disciplined I guess I would just cut it off at a certain time and even if I didn't get to all the questions and I may have to do that you know if there's enough people watching and asking questions at some point I'll just have to cut it off CU I you know I wouldn't be able to answer it to be hours and hours so uh we'll see I do I think I definitely want to start getting it back down towards the 1 hour and not go over two hours anymore so um anyway but I I'll take that in consideration because I've gotten similar uh comments about the length is just it's just really long okay let's see hey Kevin's here how's it going uh okay wolf wolf says I think it's excellent that they are that long just think it has something to do with your view counts yeah yeah you're right all right so I yeah I have two minutes until my meeting starts so I definitely have to go uh if you do have any questions just send them to me on Twitter put them in the comments of the video I'll try to get to him as soon as I can thank you so much uh for watching today and for helping me out sorry we couldn't actually get anything accomplished uh but hopefully I can get it all sorted out tomorrow morning and then show you uh how I got it to work for tomorrow's video I think 200 tomorrow will work uh so I will see you then have a great day
