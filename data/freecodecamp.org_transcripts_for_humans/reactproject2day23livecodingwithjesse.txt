00:08 - hey everybody its Jesse and I'm back
00:12 - after being sick most of the week still
00:16 - not a hundred percent so today's stream
00:19 - will probably be shorter than normal
00:21 - I'm thinking like maybe an hour or less
00:27 - I'm gonna do my best my throat hurts a
00:31 - bit so I do have some tea here so if you
00:34 - hear a slurping noise that's me sipping
00:36 - my tea and I'm pretty tired so this may
00:44 - be equal more of a relaxed type of
00:47 - stream today but I guess I'm gonna start
00:53 - out by going over some of the pool
00:56 - requests that I got quickly and then
01:01 - we'll see I left off working on getting
01:08 - a logo and the title to look right so it
01:11 - just needs a little bit more adjustment
01:13 - and then I think it'll be okay so maybe
01:14 - we'll finish that up and see how much
01:17 - time we have left
01:21 - also I want to say thank you to everyone
01:25 - a lot of you either on Twitter or in the
01:30 - slack channel said let me know you were
01:36 - concerned or you're praying for me
01:37 - everything so I really appreciate that I
01:39 - was really I mean oh that was nice
01:43 - I wasn't feeling well and to see all
01:48 - that support from all of you that was
01:50 - that was really cool so I appreciate
01:52 - that and also some really awesome news
01:58 - the freaka camp channel now has over two
02:01 - hundred thousand subscribers so really
02:05 - excited about that
02:06 - that was cool I've been keeping an eye
02:08 - on it lately
02:09 - me because it was getting close to 2000
02:14 - and I was just waiting for it and it it
02:18 - happened at some point while I was sick
02:20 - I just noticed that yesterday but that's
02:25 - really cool so thank you to everyone who
02:26 - who's subscribed I feel kind of proud
02:31 - that maybe I've contributed a bit with
02:33 - my with my live streams to subscribers
02:36 - and there's a lot of other great people
02:38 - that do the do videos on this channel as
02:43 - well and they're responsible for for
02:46 - most of those subscribers but that's
02:50 - really cool that's that's a lot of
02:51 - people so hopefully we keep growing
02:54 - because I think this channel has a lot
02:57 - of really great information to help
03:00 - people learn how to code so the more
03:01 - people that know about it the better off
03:04 - they'll be alright hey everyone I see I
03:09 - see some of you in the live chat now
03:18 - cool thanks thanks yes John John said
03:22 - you live streams rock thanks thanks
03:27 - thanks Blake I appreciate I appreciate
03:29 - everybody's in saying hi hey how's it
03:34 - goin all right so let's I'm gonna try
03:39 - really hard to stay focused so I guess
03:40 - I'm pretty I'm pretty tired
03:43 - hopefully the caffeine in this tea will
03:45 - help help me wake up a bit more as well
03:53 - alright so there were a lot of changes
03:57 - and we had to pull requests that I think
04:02 - we only had to yeah I don't I don't
04:05 - think I pulled any in while I was at
04:07 - home I was kind of out of it so I tried
04:10 - not to do that much coding so I didn't
04:14 - mess anything up I did work on a project
04:17 - for my react course which I didn't
04:19 - really get that much accomplished on
04:21 - redux is
04:23 - confusing me quite a bit right now I'm
04:27 - sure I'll get it I think keep working on
04:28 - it
04:29 - but anyway
04:33 - Nathaniel submitted one pull request and
04:36 - he added added to the get ignore which
04:40 - is awesome and very useful so thank you
04:42 - for that and then I guess the next pull
04:49 - request is really huge so I'm not really
04:52 - gonna go over it all because it would be
04:54 - so much I guess I just kind of really
04:57 - briefly summarized some of what was in
05:00 - it and you can check it out I'm double
05:05 - check on my other screen with the number
05:06 - of that pull request was I'm pretty sure
05:08 - it was 50 yeah so poor requests 50 is
05:13 - quite large so just from from memory I'm
05:19 - going to try to sum this up sorry if I
05:21 - miss anything and this is from Matt a
05:26 - lot of the data so basic strategies are
05:44 - less now so there's more components so
05:47 - you have a few more components now we
05:49 - have all these data files also another
05:53 - change is matt has switched out the
05:57 - regular map for lodash this map and he
06:03 - links you could check it out in the in
06:07 - the pool request he provides a link to
06:11 - comparison as to which one's faster
06:14 - which is cool
06:16 - the only thing I'm I just noticed I
06:19 - didn't notice this when I was pulling
06:20 - this in and I just noticed it a few
06:22 - minutes ago was it looks like we're in
06:24 - forwarding all of lodash and so it might
06:28 - be better since we're only using as far
06:31 - as I can tell yep in this component
06:34 - we're only using
06:36 - we could probably just import map I mean
06:40 - that's like a really really small if you
06:43 - look at the low - github repo to import
06:48 - map it's I don't know like the entire
06:52 - file is like less than 50 lines and 80%
06:55 - of it or it's just comments explaining
06:57 - what it does so it'd be really small
07:00 - amount of code to import instead of
07:03 - everything so I'll probably change that
07:05 - at some point if somebody really wants
07:08 - to get a pull request and on your github
07:12 - profile maybe you know you just starting
07:15 - out that would be something really easy
07:17 - just look up how to on low - this
07:21 - documentation how to just import that -
07:23 - switch it over I think it's not just map
07:27 - though I think filter is also replaced
07:32 - where we are using it so we're not are
07:34 - we using it here we're not using it here
07:37 - but anywhere we're using filter then
07:39 - filter will need to be pulled in as well
07:41 - so maybe I'll if I remember maybe I'll
07:48 - open up a an issue kind of explaining
07:52 - that and then that way you all can let
07:55 - me know what you think about it as well
07:58 - okay so let me show you what I've done
08:02 - so I I did make sure to update the repo
08:07 - before before I started the stream so
08:12 - everything should be up-to-date on
08:13 - github I I think I may have forgotten to
08:18 - update the repo at the end of Monday
08:21 - stream so sorry about that if I did I
08:29 - guess I could scroll back up through my
08:31 - terminal to double-check but anyway this
08:37 - basically I was just working on this
08:39 - this is where we left off before so you
08:42 - could see I right now I have resource
08:44 - center over here to the right we now
08:47 - have this menu icon
08:50 - is visible and working and then our logo
08:52 - is here the only thing that needs
08:57 - changes when I move this over here for
09:01 - some reason it just made the header a
09:04 - lot taller than it needs to be so I'd
09:07 - like to shrink this up a little bit move
09:10 - everything up and then I think it'll be
09:13 - I think it'll look all right I'm not I
09:17 - really like this I like I like the logo
09:20 - I think that looks nice
09:24 - I'm not exactly sure what to do with
09:26 - this so that's why I just put it over
09:27 - here and in any case we'll have to
09:31 - figure out what to do on a small screen
09:33 - because you know that's that's not what
09:36 - we want so still have some things to
09:41 - decide but I think this looks it looks
09:46 - good enough at this point fine you know
09:49 - if we have time we can always adjust
09:52 - that more later on
10:03 - okay
10:13 - oh cool I just checked the live chat
10:15 - really quickly and it looks like Matt
10:22 - Matt your MFC 88 right I'm pretty sure
10:25 - you are sorry if I'm forgetting things I
10:29 - am out of it I'm usually pretty good
10:30 - about remembering what everybody's
10:32 - handles are in YouTube then anyway Matt
10:36 - offered to help with redux Thanks
10:38 - oh okay cool oh I may be asking you a
10:43 - question i yes i really like i read
10:53 - through so much documentation on
10:56 - I think Tuesday when I was - I I just
11:00 - sat in a recliner with my laptop and
11:05 - like took naps and read Redux
11:08 - documentation pretty much all day so yes
11:16 - I'll be asking about that and thanks for
11:19 - offering to help Sebastian set us I
11:22 - should add some margin left to poster
11:25 - resources and poster okay yep yeah I
11:30 - should probably have this line up on all
11:34 - the pages with this I'm not sure why
11:42 - it's not lining up right now after look
11:43 - I probably just don't have it within the
11:45 - same container or something
11:48 - okay so first let's get this let's get
11:55 - this to a point where we like how it
11:57 - looks and then we'll go from there so
12:03 - since this was when I added this that's
12:08 - when this got a lot taller then I'm
12:11 - gonna start by looking here to see
12:13 - what's going on with the the margins and
12:17 - padding and it's probably something to
12:19 - do with with padding let me make this a
12:21 - bit smaller
12:24 - and should be able to see as I hover
12:30 - over will be able to see the margins and
12:32 - in orange okay so we definitely have
12:37 - some more margin that we need going on
12:39 - okay and our div also has just some
12:45 - default default margin so I guess we
12:55 - could actually I think that divs
13:00 - auto-generated so it's gonna be a bit
13:06 - more difficult to get to this div so
13:10 - let's just worry about the h1 when I
13:15 - when I say auto-generated I mean this
13:17 - div is added in and in one of the
13:19 - material I components so I don't really
13:23 - have direct access to it cuz I don't I
13:25 - don't want to edit the components
13:27 - directly so tojust and there's no unique
13:32 - identifier here so it'll be a lot easier
13:35 - just to try to adjust this h1 which I'm
13:38 - passing in this h1 so I can put styles
13:45 - right on that it's the only h1 on the
13:47 - page so I can even reference that right
13:51 - in the sass file and I know it'll just
13:54 - it will apply here yeah so let's just
14:00 - try to get rid of all the margin and see
14:03 - if we'll see what it looks like
14:09 - okay so with margin zero that's not
14:17 - terrible it looks like it's not it's not
14:21 - exactly centered though
14:34 - it's a
14:50 - yes
15:04 - so I'm checking this out I'm not sure
15:08 - why why this div
15:21 - is bigger
15:35 - okay yes it doesn't matter
15:43 - if we add
15:51 - now I may have to actually edit this div
15:54 - let's see let's just shut it let's add a
15:57 - bit of margin on the top I want to see
15:59 - if it would basically what I want to
16:01 - happen is to push this down without
16:03 - making the header bigger what I think
16:05 - might happen is the header will just get
16:08 - pushed down hopefully not but we'll give
16:10 - it a shot
16:11 - oh nice awesome so cool I don't really
16:22 - like trying to eyeball this and just
16:25 - guess at it being centered I could I
16:29 - could probably do some math and get it a
16:31 - little bit closer but that that looks
16:33 - about right we can zoom in a bit
16:37 - maybe so not letting me zoom in that's
16:43 - weird well for some reason I can't zoom
16:54 - you know normally you could if you have
16:57 - a Mac you know you could zoom in with
16:59 - the track that can't do it okay well at
17:05 - least that that works though so if we go
17:08 - with margin
17:19 - when we end up with five okay five pics
17:23 - back let me do it let me do it in the
17:25 - code I think we had it a nap yeah so I
17:29 - already have some styles on that h1 so
17:33 - let's go with margin and five for the
17:37 - top top right bottom left
17:52 - all right awesome okay so yeah I'm still
18:01 - not 100% sure about this being over here
18:06 - but we'll go for it for now another
18:19 - I guess an alternative that I have seen
18:21 - is we probably have to really change how
18:27 - this this bar works and maybe make our
18:30 - own component but you can have so like
18:35 - the menu can still stay out out here on
18:37 - the side but the logo and the title
18:42 - would be within these bounds of the
18:46 - container so the maximum you know
18:50 - there's there's a max width here I can't
18:52 - remember what it is maybe 2000 pixels so
18:56 - they would stay here within those bounds
18:59 - that might look better yeah this looks
19:04 - at the very least it needs a bit more
19:07 - margin I think which let's add that in
19:11 - well what we have this up that's add 8
19:18 - pixels
19:26 - let's see
19:29 - all right that's better at least it
19:31 - doesn't get covered up
19:37 - okay not bad
19:43 - then I check the live chat quickly just
19:46 - to see what you all think
20:15 - okay John makes a good point well
20:18 - several good points I'm gonna read one
20:20 - of them out it says because you're using
20:23 - the font size control on with the width
20:26 - of the screen that margin might align
20:27 - differently at different widths I
20:29 - actually I don't think I'm using it for
20:31 - this one so let me let me make sure
20:45 - unless you were talking about this one
20:47 - instead which I think I am using that I
20:53 - guess responsive font for that one and I
21:04 - actually on this page I do have this
21:08 - aligned so probably earlier Sebastian
21:13 - had mentioned that this heading was kind
21:17 - of outside the bounds of where all the
21:20 - rest of the content was on another page
21:24 - something on posters so you can see that
21:26 - here so I'm I'm almost positive now that
21:31 - I saw the other page is it's just a
21:33 - matter of where I put this H SH - of
21:37 - whether or not I put it inside the same
21:40 - container so that'll be an easy fix
21:47 - okay well let's let's commit this and
21:52 - then move on we still have just have a
21:59 - good amount of time left or not even a
22:01 - half hour in so move on to something
22:04 - else and was my it is check it out what
22:16 - did we change posters yep that's what I
22:20 - wanted to change and
22:27 - see I don't know what I changed him
22:29 - posters touch ass oh you know what I
22:36 - changed some was it I changed something
22:40 - earlier right before I started the
22:42 - stream and I hadn't committed that yet
22:44 - so that's what it is we're gonna commit
22:48 - this we're going to use am flag so that
22:52 - we can commit and add and put a message
22:56 - at the same time so let's say just title
23:07 - margins yeah that works
23:34 - all right great pass all the tests made
23:37 - it through linting so now we can get
23:44 - mastered all right awesome
23:55 - so now but let's let's go and since
23:58 - since Sebastian brought it up let's fix
24:02 - this so if anyone has any objections to
24:06 - this being aligned here if for some
24:08 - reason you think it looks better being a
24:10 - few pixels to the left let me know
24:14 - quickly before I start changing it
24:16 - otherwise I'm going to proceed with
24:19 - adjusting it where wherever this is this
24:22 - problem is found
24:42 - mmm
24:52 - yeah it looks like Sebastian you're
24:55 - you're absolutely right that's what I
24:57 - was just checking out as well the h2
25:02 - should be inside a column and then it
25:06 - will give everything the the correct
25:13 - alignment let's see just put this in a
25:18 - column actually I I usually do try to
25:25 - put things in columns because I have had
25:30 - problems with this before with similar
25:32 - issues I guess I just was I don't know
25:35 - what I was thinking there maybe I was
25:37 - just trying to go quickly and just get
25:39 - something on a page that's probably
25:41 - probably would happen Wow I am really
26:07 - and I want to start off okay
26:18 - oh man I can't even copy and paste today
26:25 - there we go
26:31 - all right awesome so it fixes that so
26:35 - just go through quickly and see if it's
26:40 - doing that on any other pages
26:49 - let's check out huh yep it's doing it on
26:53 - home so let's see
27:23 - all right logos hmm
27:53 - okay planning guide
28:05 - okay
28:27 - okay well I'm trying to look this is
28:31 - this component is really different than
28:34 - it was before the last pull request so
28:40 - kind of figure out where everything is
28:45 - anything guidelines
28:53 - all right
29:08 - all right great and already have an
29:11 - English only one more page
29:13 - it's a glossary page this I'm not sure
29:20 - I'm just gonna check that page yep
29:25 - it's not
29:44 - all right awesome
29:48 - okay so that should be all the pages so
29:51 - now we have consistency there so thanks
29:55 - for bringing that up Sebastian I do have
30:02 - a question in the live chat so I'm just
30:05 - going to take this question right now
30:09 - since I forgot to set my timer right now
30:13 - it would be if I had set my timer at the
30:16 - beginning it would be right about the
30:17 - time where I'd take my 5 minutes to look
30:21 - at the live chat so I'm gonna do that so
30:27 - how what says I'm starting college this
30:30 - year and want to get into programming I
30:32 - just started practicing yesterday on
30:35 - free code camp so I'm excited to see
30:37 - where I go with this Oh awesome
30:40 - sorry I thought it was a question I
30:42 - didn't read the whole thing first
30:46 - anyway that's that's really cool my my
30:52 - wife actually just started free code
30:54 - camp within the last week or so she's
30:56 - going to try to do the hundred days of
30:58 - code and it's kind of cool it's my wife
31:04 - was not released my wife's an English
31:07 - professor so not really into coding
31:09 - before but it's kind of cool to be able
31:12 - to go through and and help her out with
31:14 - some of the exercises so so she's going
31:19 - through the same thing you just starting
31:21 - out with it so I hope you stick with it
31:25 - and let me know if you if you need any
31:29 - help or encouragement with anything
31:38 - all right I don't think there's any
31:41 - other questions I'm going to scroll
31:43 - through quickly
32:00 - digital dolly game says free code camp
32:04 - needs to make c-sharp tutorials I don't
32:09 - know if there's any plans to do any
32:11 - c-sharp tutorials if it happens it's not
32:14 - going to be me because I have very
32:15 - limited experience with she C sharp so
32:20 - you can't can't really give you a much
32:28 - hope of that right now not there's no
32:31 - snow plans that I know of that maybe
32:34 - somebody's working on it and I just
32:36 - don't know
32:47 - oh cool Alberto says that he started
32:50 - recording some some coding sessions in
32:54 - c-sharp he's not not comfortable about
33:02 - releasing it yet
33:03 - Umberto's especially since I'm nowhere
33:05 - near the quality of Jessi dev tips
33:08 - traversing media and all the other
33:10 - already established face so I'm bear to
33:14 - the fact that you mentioned me in the
33:17 - same sentence as dev tips makes me just
33:20 - super happy because I because I love the
33:25 - deficits show and yeah so if I'm like if
33:32 - in your mind I'm anywhere close to to
33:35 - that caliber of show then that's a
33:39 - really big compliment for me so I
33:41 - appreciate that
33:42 - and also I would say I mean don't worry
33:49 - so much about whether or not something's
33:52 - ready to be released
33:54 - hmm sorry
33:57 - yawning getting really tired
34:01 - yeah don't worry so much about whether
34:05 - you're ready if you know I like I don't
34:13 - know when I started I didn't really
34:14 - practice if anybody goes like to my my
34:17 - own channel my personal channel and
34:19 - watch this on my first streams they're
34:22 - not good I couldn't get the settings
34:24 - right
34:24 - and so the quality's bad
34:29 - so yeah it's and I think for some of the
34:33 - videos that the font was so small you
34:35 - couldn't even see it at all so sometimes
34:39 - you figure that out and yeah I mean I
34:44 - guess I kind of feel bad if people try
34:46 - to go back and watch that watch those
34:49 - first videos the quality is bad but you
34:52 - know like really quickly you catch on so
34:59 - anyway I think it's just cool it's more
35:02 - encouragement if you actually have the
35:04 - stuff out there and you can get feedback
35:05 - from people and encouragement from those
35:08 - people then you'll be more likely to
35:09 - stick with it I know if I had just like
35:12 - recorded my my stuff and watched it
35:15 - myself before I actually put it out
35:19 - there I probably would have been too
35:22 - self-conscious about it to actually post
35:25 - it but instead just on the live stream
35:28 - it it doesn't give me a chance to
35:31 - second-guess myself because it's already
35:33 - out there which in my case ends up being
35:38 - a good thing because then I get my stuff
35:44 - out there and in it otherwise wouldn't
35:46 - be
36:07 - oh okay really quickly I'm going to
36:10 - address this I just saw some of the
36:13 - conversation that was happening when I
36:15 - was answering things previewed that were
36:17 - up near the top of the live chat someone
36:22 - trying to fun whoo chaos 2 is using next
36:28 - Jas with create react which I've never
36:36 - heard of that
36:45 - well
36:50 - yeah I would say so Sebastian said check
36:54 - the previous project yes if you check
36:56 - out the previous project that was with
36:59 - next jazz so yeah I've actually never
37:04 - heard of anyone using both before I
37:06 - would imagine that it there's there's
37:08 - probably an easier way to do that you
37:10 - would only really need to use one or the
37:12 - other depending on what you need
37:23 - Patrick says the difference between you
37:25 - and dev tips is that he edits out
37:27 - periods where he is stuck yeah I wonder
37:29 - how long my streams would really be if I
37:31 - edit it out all the times I messed up I
37:33 - would have five minute videos Umberto's
37:46 - says I just don't want to get bad
37:47 - information I want to be able to do the
37:49 - thing where I stress that this is it's
37:54 - just I am showing how to do it but it's
37:57 - difficult to do when I feel like there's
37:58 - a better correct way to do things
38:00 - yeah I'm Bert oh I am I definitely
38:03 - understand that I feel the same way too
38:04 - I I do really want to show so I I there
38:11 - are a lot of times when there's not
38:12 - necessarily a correct way but there are
38:15 - some ways that maybe better than others
38:16 - it depends on what your goal is in your
38:20 - particular requirements for that project
38:23 - but I I definitely understand that and I
38:27 - I feel bad if I say something that I
38:30 - later find out was not the right way to
38:33 - do things and so I do try to mention
38:36 - that but I I realized that you know not
38:39 - everybody watches every minute of every
38:41 - stream so there are going to be people
38:43 - who probably watch something in an
38:44 - earlier stream and never realize that
38:47 - I've corrected it later on and at this
38:50 - point there's just so many streams it
38:52 - would be really hard to go back and
38:54 - correct everything so I totally
38:57 - understand that but I think like you say
39:01 - if you just give I mean I frequently
39:03 - give the disclaimer that you know this
39:06 - is just me doing this you know the best
39:08 - way I know how
39:09 - with with all you help from all of you
39:12 - you know if people understand that
39:14 - coming in that that's that that's what's
39:16 - going on here then I may I feel better
39:21 - about it at least you know I don't I
39:25 - don't claim that this is a tutorial you
39:28 - know
39:29 - so anyway but totally up to you
39:33 - certainly if you feel comfortable or not
39:35 - but it would be cool you know to see
39:37 - them so let me know when you when you do
39:40 - release them I'd like to check them out
39:42 - I said not really into doing anything
39:44 - with c-sharp but we do run some things
39:46 - with c-sharp here at the University I
39:48 - don't work on them but it'd be cool to
39:51 - know a little bit more about them just
39:52 - to understand how things how things work
39:55 - because occasionally I do have to help
40:00 - like like right now we're we're down one
40:04 - developer in the department that works
40:06 - on the c-sharp stuff so I have to help
40:09 - occasionally if something is like an
40:13 - emergency and really needs done alright
40:20 - so let's a sh says hey can we ask
40:26 - questions if we don't understand
40:27 - something yes definitely
40:36 - yeah so I'm gonna do some more coding
40:39 - but before I end I'm gonna go back
40:41 - through and see if there's any questions
40:42 - and and I'll answer them all before I
40:46 - finish the stream so let's do some more
40:48 - I'm not let's see how about I could for
40:53 - about ten more minutes and then I do
40:55 - questions and then that way I'll be I'll
40:59 - be finished in about an hour which I
41:04 - just don't want to push it cuz I don't
41:06 - want to lose my voice and I'm getting
41:10 - tired so I think the quality of my
41:12 - coding is going to go down quickly I can
41:16 - already feel it's like it's hard to
41:18 - focus
41:28 - all right I guess I should figure out
41:31 - what I'm gonna change first see that
41:33 - talking about that focus he difficult
41:40 - all right let me think of something that
41:45 - I can get done in ten minutes I guess I
41:47 - could check my shell award
42:00 - I guess that's done I'll double-check it
42:04 - I'll put it here
42:17 - actually let's let's work on this
42:20 - because I think this is really
42:21 - interesting and I've never tried this
42:22 - before and I have no idea if I can get
42:25 - it done in ten minutes but I'd like to
42:27 - just check it out so we before we had we
42:33 - set up our file upload and it's giving
42:36 - us a list and it was someone maybe
42:43 - Sebastian had had got this working and I
42:46 - think he was the one that suggested this
42:50 - I'm not 100% sure so sorry if I'm giving
42:52 - credit to the wrong person but let me
42:55 - show you what we're talking about so in
42:58 - our upload files lists you upload a few
43:06 - okay so we have I guess I need more
43:10 - that's a lot of them ok so right now it
43:17 - gets cut off and you can't see the rest
43:19 - right you can't do anything about it so
43:22 - it'd be cool to scroll normally I'm not
43:25 - a huge fan of horizontal scrolling but
43:27 - in this case it makes sense it makes
43:30 - more sense I think than having them
43:31 - wrapped because that would just mess up
43:35 - the spacing too so let's try to do a
43:41 - horizontal scroll hopefully this is as
43:43 - simple as just setting the overflow and
43:47 - if that's the case we can definitely get
43:49 - this done so let's see there we go
43:57 - but
44:01 - hmmm let's shout out overflow
44:15 - no she's not working I I doubt it would
44:18 - work to put it on here but let's let's
44:21 - try it actually we did have the
44:25 - overflow:hidden no no it's not working
44:30 - and not really anything else I could do
44:37 - about that huh
44:55 - okay so this is just a text input and
45:01 - the only it's only job is just to hold
45:04 - these values right now so what if we
45:11 - made it a multi-line text input it might
45:18 - wrap then right so it would be what a
45:25 - text area instead of an input
45:42 - let's uh let's try that I'm not sure
45:47 - about it like I said because that might
45:51 - end up changing the spacing but if I
45:54 - can't get the horizontal scroll then
45:55 - that's the next best thing I'll have to
45:59 - make sure see class file path hopefully
46:06 - everything is referencing this class
46:09 - name so that if I keep the same class
46:12 - name it should still work but yes
46:15 - there's one way to find out let's just
46:19 - do it much use that service requests
46:34 - okay so yeah there's a lot to this
46:43 - okay here's our file upload and there we
46:47 - go here's our input okay
46:58 - oops
47:08 - textarea and do we need a type on the
47:12 - tech series
47:21 - and I think we do
47:27 - see oh goodness
47:32 - well that that looks really ugly I'm not
47:36 - worried about that right now I'm just
47:37 - kind of worried about if it works what
47:40 - we'll need to do is is use the material
47:45 - UI excuse me let me tear you eye
47:51 - component for this instead of just
47:53 - changing its a text area some files
48:07 - hmm
48:18 - all right well
48:23 - that of course is not what we want but
48:27 - what should happen though if we're using
48:33 - this type of text arias it should expand
48:36 - so I'm hoping that we'll get it to
48:40 - expand like that
49:01 - let's see
49:06 - oops let's go back and text field okay
49:27 - I'm just gonna copy this and remove what
49:30 - we don't need
50:00 - let's get rid of this
50:13 - okay
50:16 - Suter looks like not dopes
50:23 - I never removed this one
50:32 - okay need some adjustment but doesn't
50:38 - look that bad so far
50:42 - yay all right that's so much better all
50:48 - right I like that I like that and I'm
50:51 - not super worried about the spacing like
50:55 - I thought I would be basically because
50:58 - the odds of some of the uploading this
51:00 - many files are slim so not that many
51:02 - people will even see it but even then it
51:05 - doesn't look terrible
51:07 - below is a whole new section so it would
51:11 - look a lot it would look weird if let's
51:17 - say it was right in the middle of here
51:19 - where you do have a uniform spacing and
51:21 - then all of a sudden it would change but
51:25 - because this space here only happens
51:27 - once it doesn't really seem like it's
51:32 - messed up now what I would like to do is
51:36 - make in relation to this upload button
51:40 - have this aligned a little bit better at
51:46 - the very least I want to have the top of
51:48 - this lined up with the top of this
51:50 - button probably best thing would be to
51:54 - have it centered but not bad and that
52:01 - works
52:07 - and I think do you need to double-check
52:10 - where else am i I don't think I'm that
52:18 - will affect anything else I was just
52:20 - kind of wondering about when I get all
52:24 - the values to send out in the email and
52:29 - send our project management system well
52:32 - I think it should be fine because it's
52:37 - the same eating the value from a text
52:41 - area and from an input field is the same
52:46 - as opposed to like getting a checkbox
52:49 - value or something okay that's cool I
52:54 - like that my timer went off so I'm gonna
52:59 - answer some questions now and off
53:04 - probably before I leave today I'll clean
53:07 - this up a bit and then commit that as
53:09 - well as I don't think I committed this
53:11 - yet where we lined up all of these up so
53:16 - I'll do that too
53:18 - and then that way everything on github
53:22 - will be up to date
53:36 - okay ash asks are there any repos of
53:42 - these projects on github or bitbucket I
53:44 - want to compare with my code to see if
53:48 - I'm doing something wrong and Joseph did
53:53 - say look in the description yeah so if
53:58 - if you want to follow along this is on
54:01 - github I do have the links in the
54:03 - descriptions to all the videos so feel
54:07 - free to check it out use it I have a few
54:11 - people who let me know that they're
54:14 - using what I'm doing on this project or
54:18 - the last project as the basis for one of
54:21 - their projects and I think that's
54:22 - awesome so yeah so feel free and okay
54:34 - Sebastian I mentioned early I thought it
54:37 - was Sebastian that had had done the the
54:40 - upload thing maybe it's not maybe it was
54:42 - Kevin yeah it was really early on it was
54:51 - a while ago so I can't remember exactly
54:53 - but we'll say keV I don't think Kevin's
54:56 - in the live chat now so we'll just say
54:58 - it was Kevin he can't he can't let us
55:02 - know
55:04 - I think Kevin hasn't been around the
55:08 - live set for a while he's working on his
55:10 - own project and he sent me a message a
55:13 - few days ago telling me about it so it's
55:17 - cool hopefully he'll get it to the point
55:20 - where he can share that and if he lets
55:25 - me maybe I can share a link with you all
55:30 - let's see like we have some more
55:33 - question here we go
55:35 - ash ash hey just by the way Jesse what's
55:39 - your coding background like did you go
55:41 - to uni or are you self-taught so yeah I
55:46 - do have a bachelor's degree but it's in
55:48 - business
55:50 - so I I took I did complete one C++
55:57 - programming course but so that's the
56:01 - extent of my formal education maybe I
56:07 - did take a class in high school where we
56:09 - spent a couple weeks on basic HTML but I
56:13 - don't know that that really counts but
56:15 - other than that it's just been all
56:17 - online and mostly free resources I think
56:23 - I spent maybe $30 on udemy courses and
56:29 - until very recently until a few months
56:32 - ago when I signed up for the react nano
56:34 - degree like I literally had spent 30
56:37 - dollars or less on courses the entire
56:40 - time that I've been doing this so big
56:43 - you know years I had spent that so which
56:50 - I I say that because it's it's really I
56:53 - think it's a really cool thing about
56:55 - this industry that someone with very
56:59 - little in terms of financial resources
57:02 - can learn enough and get a job doing
57:06 - this which I think that's awesome
57:08 - because so many other fields are like
57:11 - it's just hard to break into unless
57:13 - you're already wealthy because the cost
57:16 - to get in you know I'm thinking like if
57:18 - you want to be a doctor or a lawyer
57:21 - unless you want to go into a lot of debt
57:25 - you just you can't you can't do it you
57:29 - know you need me need so much money to
57:32 - be able to go go to school for that many
57:35 - years to get that the education you need
57:39 - so anyway I did give a also on my
57:44 - channel there's a link in the
57:45 - description that I think there's a link
57:47 - in the description to my channel
57:49 - otherwise you can just look up Jesse
57:53 - Weigel and it should come up
57:59 - on YouTube search but I did a video kind
58:03 - of going through my history of learning
58:06 - to be a front-end developer so if you
58:07 - want to know more check that out it's
58:11 - not it's not super long I think it's
58:13 - like 10 minutes so it's not really
58:15 - in-depth but it'll give you kind of a
58:16 - nice overview of where I came from and
58:19 - how I got to where I am now
58:36 - ooh ooh Paul says business decoding so
58:40 - good that's pretty great yeah actually I
58:46 - don't I don't think I said this on a
58:50 - stream before or in my video but I guess
58:53 - I'll take the last minute here just to
58:55 - say this it may it may be helpful to
58:59 - somebody so when I was a teenager
59:04 - I had thought about doing coding I was
59:07 - always really good with computers and a
59:10 - lot of people said you know why don't
59:12 - you do computers I have an uncle who's a
59:14 - programmer and you know he would talk to
59:16 - me about it and I had decided I didn't
59:21 - want to do computers because I thought
59:23 - if I did computers I would just be stuck
59:26 - in a cubicle all day and I wouldn't get
59:28 - to talk to anybody and that would be my
59:30 - life I if you've ever seen the first
59:32 - Matrix movie where the main character
59:34 - that's literally he has this tiny little
59:37 - cubicle and he just types on his
59:40 - keyboard all day and it's it's terrible
59:42 - so that's the idea I had in my mind of
59:44 - what I would do and I said no like I
59:46 - don't really want to do that now
59:49 - hopefully probably some of you were
59:51 - laughing when you hear that because
59:53 - that's not at all what this is right so
59:55 - I had a mistaken view of what what this
60:01 - was all about and I probably would have
60:04 - been in this a lot earlier had I had I
60:10 - had a better view of things you know I
60:13 - mean now it seems were crazy because now
60:15 - you have like it's well known that
60:17 - Google's offices are really cool and you
60:20 - know I don't know things have changed I
60:24 - think in terms of the perception of what
60:26 - what coding is but you know at least
60:31 - when I was a teenager it wasn't like
60:35 - that so anyway so that's why I ended up
60:40 - going into business and because but I
60:44 - really
60:46 - was kind of into coding and they thought
60:48 - about it earlier so it's kind of cool
60:52 - that I ended up back here in the end and
60:54 - although I am actually sitting in an
60:58 - office by myself right now I'm talking
61:01 - to all of you so it's not like I'm
61:05 - somehow chained to a cubicle or anything
61:08 - like that anyway so I guess the the
61:16 - moral of my story if there is one is
61:19 - especially for those of you maybe who
61:21 - are younger this would be more helpful
61:23 - but don't don't dismiss something some
61:29 - you know a job or anything that you have
61:31 - interest in you know without really
61:33 - checking it out you know so like see if
61:37 - you can get an internship or like shadow
61:39 - somebody who does that job you know to
61:42 - really find out what it's like because
61:46 - now that I'm doing this I love it and it
61:49 - would have been really cool if I could
61:51 - have been doing this then you know some
61:53 - of the other jobs that I've had if
61:55 - nothing so great so I would have much
61:58 - rather done this then then the other
62:01 - things that I've done so anyway I think
62:06 - that's I've got all the questions so I'm
62:11 - gonna wrap things up and probably get
62:14 - out of here early and go take a nap I
62:17 - guess if mike my kids let me feel I was
62:21 - thinking that but oh well it's already
62:27 - Friday I was gonna say I'll see you
62:29 - tomorrow but it's it's Friday the whole
62:31 - week's been messed up for me I'm really
62:37 - thinking about it now it is Friday right
62:39 - yeah I just checked my calendar okay
62:42 - uh-huh so I will see you all on Monday
62:47 - and have a great weekend hopefully I'll
62:53 - be back to a hundred percent by Monday
62:57 - and I can get some some real work done
63:00 - on this thank you all so much for
63:05 - watching for all your help and have a
63:11 - great weekend

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody its Jesse and I'm back after being sick most of the week still not a hundred percent so today's stream will probably be shorter than normal I'm thinking like maybe an hour or less I'm gonna do my best my throat hurts a bit so I do have some tea here so if you hear a slurping noise that's me sipping my tea and I'm pretty tired so this may be equal more of a relaxed type of stream today but I guess I'm gonna start out by going over some of the pool requests that I got quickly and then we'll see I left off working on getting a logo and the title to look right so it just needs a little bit more adjustment and then I think it'll be okay so maybe we'll finish that up and see how much time we have left also I want to say thank you to everyone a lot of you either on Twitter or in the slack channel said let me know you were concerned or you're praying for me everything so I really appreciate that I was really I mean oh that was nice I wasn't feeling well and to see all that support from all of you that was that was really cool so I appreciate that and also some really awesome news the freaka camp channel now has over two hundred thousand subscribers so really excited about that that was cool I've been keeping an eye on it lately me because it was getting close to 2000 and I was just waiting for it and it it happened at some point while I was sick I just noticed that yesterday but that's really cool so thank you to everyone who who's subscribed I feel kind of proud that maybe I've contributed a bit with my with my live streams to subscribers and there's a lot of other great people that do the do videos on this channel as well and they're responsible for for most of those subscribers but that's really cool that's that's a lot of people so hopefully we keep growing because I think this channel has a lot of really great information to help people learn how to code so the more people that know about it the better off they'll be alright hey everyone I see I see some of you in the live chat now cool thanks thanks yes John John said you live streams rock thanks thanks thanks Blake I appreciate I appreciate everybody's in saying hi hey how's it goin all right so let's I'm gonna try really hard to stay focused so I guess I'm pretty I'm pretty tired hopefully the caffeine in this tea will help help me wake up a bit more as well alright so there were a lot of changes and we had to pull requests that I think we only had to yeah I don't I don't think I pulled any in while I was at home I was kind of out of it so I tried not to do that much coding so I didn't mess anything up I did work on a project for my react course which I didn't really get that much accomplished on redux is confusing me quite a bit right now I'm sure I'll get it I think keep working on it but anyway Nathaniel submitted one pull request and he added added to the get ignore which is awesome and very useful so thank you for that and then I guess the next pull request is really huge so I'm not really gonna go over it all because it would be so much I guess I just kind of really briefly summarized some of what was in it and you can check it out I'm double check on my other screen with the number of that pull request was I'm pretty sure it was 50 yeah so poor requests 50 is quite large so just from from memory I'm going to try to sum this up sorry if I miss anything and this is from Matt a lot of the data so basic strategies are less now so there's more components so you have a few more components now we have all these data files also another change is matt has switched out the regular map for lodash this map and he links you could check it out in the in the pool request he provides a link to comparison as to which one's faster which is cool the only thing I'm I just noticed I didn't notice this when I was pulling this in and I just noticed it a few minutes ago was it looks like we're in forwarding all of lodash and so it might be better since we're only using as far as I can tell yep in this component we're only using we could probably just import map I mean that's like a really really small if you look at the low github repo to import map it's I don't know like the entire file is like less than 50 lines and 80% of it or it's just comments explaining what it does so it'd be really small amount of code to import instead of everything so I'll probably change that at some point if somebody really wants to get a pull request and on your github profile maybe you know you just starting out that would be something really easy just look up how to on low this documentation how to just import that switch it over I think it's not just map though I think filter is also replaced where we are using it so we're not are we using it here we're not using it here but anywhere we're using filter then filter will need to be pulled in as well so maybe I'll if I remember maybe I'll open up a an issue kind of explaining that and then that way you all can let me know what you think about it as well okay so let me show you what I've done so I I did make sure to update the repo before before I started the stream so everything should be uptodate on github I I think I may have forgotten to update the repo at the end of Monday stream so sorry about that if I did I guess I could scroll back up through my terminal to doublecheck but anyway this basically I was just working on this this is where we left off before so you could see I right now I have resource center over here to the right we now have this menu icon is visible and working and then our logo is here the only thing that needs changes when I move this over here for some reason it just made the header a lot taller than it needs to be so I'd like to shrink this up a little bit move everything up and then I think it'll be I think it'll look all right I'm not I really like this I like I like the logo I think that looks nice I'm not exactly sure what to do with this so that's why I just put it over here and in any case we'll have to figure out what to do on a small screen because you know that's that's not what we want so still have some things to decide but I think this looks it looks good enough at this point fine you know if we have time we can always adjust that more later on okay oh cool I just checked the live chat really quickly and it looks like Matt Matt your MFC 88 right I'm pretty sure you are sorry if I'm forgetting things I am out of it I'm usually pretty good about remembering what everybody's handles are in YouTube then anyway Matt offered to help with redux Thanks oh okay cool oh I may be asking you a question i yes i really like i read through so much documentation on I think Tuesday when I was I I just sat in a recliner with my laptop and like took naps and read Redux documentation pretty much all day so yes I'll be asking about that and thanks for offering to help Sebastian set us I should add some margin left to poster resources and poster okay yep yeah I should probably have this line up on all the pages with this I'm not sure why it's not lining up right now after look I probably just don't have it within the same container or something okay so first let's get this let's get this to a point where we like how it looks and then we'll go from there so since this was when I added this that's when this got a lot taller then I'm gonna start by looking here to see what's going on with the the margins and padding and it's probably something to do with with padding let me make this a bit smaller and should be able to see as I hover over will be able to see the margins and in orange okay so we definitely have some more margin that we need going on okay and our div also has just some default default margin so I guess we could actually I think that divs autogenerated so it's gonna be a bit more difficult to get to this div so let's just worry about the h1 when I when I say autogenerated I mean this div is added in and in one of the material I components so I don't really have direct access to it cuz I don't I don't want to edit the components directly so tojust and there's no unique identifier here so it'll be a lot easier just to try to adjust this h1 which I'm passing in this h1 so I can put styles right on that it's the only h1 on the page so I can even reference that right in the sass file and I know it'll just it will apply here yeah so let's just try to get rid of all the margin and see if we'll see what it looks like okay so with margin zero that's not terrible it looks like it's not it's not exactly centered though it's a yes so I'm checking this out I'm not sure why why this div is bigger okay yes it doesn't matter if we add now I may have to actually edit this div let's see let's just shut it let's add a bit of margin on the top I want to see if it would basically what I want to happen is to push this down without making the header bigger what I think might happen is the header will just get pushed down hopefully not but we'll give it a shot oh nice awesome so cool I don't really like trying to eyeball this and just guess at it being centered I could I could probably do some math and get it a little bit closer but that that looks about right we can zoom in a bit maybe so not letting me zoom in that's weird well for some reason I can't zoom you know normally you could if you have a Mac you know you could zoom in with the track that can't do it okay well at least that that works though so if we go with margin when we end up with five okay five pics back let me do it let me do it in the code I think we had it a nap yeah so I already have some styles on that h1 so let's go with margin and five for the top top right bottom left all right awesome okay so yeah I'm still not 100% sure about this being over here but we'll go for it for now another I guess an alternative that I have seen is we probably have to really change how this this bar works and maybe make our own component but you can have so like the menu can still stay out out here on the side but the logo and the title would be within these bounds of the container so the maximum you know there's there's a max width here I can't remember what it is maybe 2000 pixels so they would stay here within those bounds that might look better yeah this looks at the very least it needs a bit more margin I think which let's add that in well what we have this up that's add 8 pixels let's see all right that's better at least it doesn't get covered up okay not bad then I check the live chat quickly just to see what you all think okay John makes a good point well several good points I'm gonna read one of them out it says because you're using the font size control on with the width of the screen that margin might align differently at different widths I actually I don't think I'm using it for this one so let me let me make sure unless you were talking about this one instead which I think I am using that I guess responsive font for that one and I actually on this page I do have this aligned so probably earlier Sebastian had mentioned that this heading was kind of outside the bounds of where all the rest of the content was on another page something on posters so you can see that here so I'm I'm almost positive now that I saw the other page is it's just a matter of where I put this H SH of whether or not I put it inside the same container so that'll be an easy fix okay well let's let's commit this and then move on we still have just have a good amount of time left or not even a half hour in so move on to something else and was my it is check it out what did we change posters yep that's what I wanted to change and see I don't know what I changed him posters touch ass oh you know what I changed some was it I changed something earlier right before I started the stream and I hadn't committed that yet so that's what it is we're gonna commit this we're going to use am flag so that we can commit and add and put a message at the same time so let's say just title margins yeah that works all right great pass all the tests made it through linting so now we can get mastered all right awesome so now but let's let's go and since since Sebastian brought it up let's fix this so if anyone has any objections to this being aligned here if for some reason you think it looks better being a few pixels to the left let me know quickly before I start changing it otherwise I'm going to proceed with adjusting it where wherever this is this problem is found mmm yeah it looks like Sebastian you're you're absolutely right that's what I was just checking out as well the h2 should be inside a column and then it will give everything the the correct alignment let's see just put this in a column actually I I usually do try to put things in columns because I have had problems with this before with similar issues I guess I just was I don't know what I was thinking there maybe I was just trying to go quickly and just get something on a page that's probably probably would happen Wow I am really and I want to start off okay oh man I can't even copy and paste today there we go all right awesome so it fixes that so just go through quickly and see if it's doing that on any other pages let's check out huh yep it's doing it on home so let's see all right logos hmm okay planning guide okay okay well I'm trying to look this is this component is really different than it was before the last pull request so kind of figure out where everything is anything guidelines all right all right great and already have an English only one more page it's a glossary page this I'm not sure I'm just gonna check that page yep it's not all right awesome okay so that should be all the pages so now we have consistency there so thanks for bringing that up Sebastian I do have a question in the live chat so I'm just going to take this question right now since I forgot to set my timer right now it would be if I had set my timer at the beginning it would be right about the time where I'd take my 5 minutes to look at the live chat so I'm gonna do that so how what says I'm starting college this year and want to get into programming I just started practicing yesterday on free code camp so I'm excited to see where I go with this Oh awesome sorry I thought it was a question I didn't read the whole thing first anyway that's that's really cool my my wife actually just started free code camp within the last week or so she's going to try to do the hundred days of code and it's kind of cool it's my wife was not released my wife's an English professor so not really into coding before but it's kind of cool to be able to go through and and help her out with some of the exercises so so she's going through the same thing you just starting out with it so I hope you stick with it and let me know if you if you need any help or encouragement with anything all right I don't think there's any other questions I'm going to scroll through quickly digital dolly game says free code camp needs to make csharp tutorials I don't know if there's any plans to do any csharp tutorials if it happens it's not going to be me because I have very limited experience with she C sharp so you can't can't really give you a much hope of that right now not there's no snow plans that I know of that maybe somebody's working on it and I just don't know oh cool Alberto says that he started recording some some coding sessions in csharp he's not not comfortable about releasing it yet Umberto's especially since I'm nowhere near the quality of Jessi dev tips traversing media and all the other already established face so I'm bear to the fact that you mentioned me in the same sentence as dev tips makes me just super happy because I because I love the deficits show and yeah so if I'm like if in your mind I'm anywhere close to to that caliber of show then that's a really big compliment for me so I appreciate that and also I would say I mean don't worry so much about whether or not something's ready to be released hmm sorry yawning getting really tired yeah don't worry so much about whether you're ready if you know I like I don't know when I started I didn't really practice if anybody goes like to my my own channel my personal channel and watch this on my first streams they're not good I couldn't get the settings right and so the quality's bad so yeah it's and I think for some of the videos that the font was so small you couldn't even see it at all so sometimes you figure that out and yeah I mean I guess I kind of feel bad if people try to go back and watch that watch those first videos the quality is bad but you know like really quickly you catch on so anyway I think it's just cool it's more encouragement if you actually have the stuff out there and you can get feedback from people and encouragement from those people then you'll be more likely to stick with it I know if I had just like recorded my my stuff and watched it myself before I actually put it out there I probably would have been too selfconscious about it to actually post it but instead just on the live stream it it doesn't give me a chance to secondguess myself because it's already out there which in my case ends up being a good thing because then I get my stuff out there and in it otherwise wouldn't be oh okay really quickly I'm going to address this I just saw some of the conversation that was happening when I was answering things previewed that were up near the top of the live chat someone trying to fun whoo chaos 2 is using next Jas with create react which I've never heard of that well yeah I would say so Sebastian said check the previous project yes if you check out the previous project that was with next jazz so yeah I've actually never heard of anyone using both before I would imagine that it there's there's probably an easier way to do that you would only really need to use one or the other depending on what you need Patrick says the difference between you and dev tips is that he edits out periods where he is stuck yeah I wonder how long my streams would really be if I edit it out all the times I messed up I would have five minute videos Umberto's says I just don't want to get bad information I want to be able to do the thing where I stress that this is it's just I am showing how to do it but it's difficult to do when I feel like there's a better correct way to do things yeah I'm Bert oh I am I definitely understand that I feel the same way too I I do really want to show so I I there are a lot of times when there's not necessarily a correct way but there are some ways that maybe better than others it depends on what your goal is in your particular requirements for that project but I I definitely understand that and I I feel bad if I say something that I later find out was not the right way to do things and so I do try to mention that but I I realized that you know not everybody watches every minute of every stream so there are going to be people who probably watch something in an earlier stream and never realize that I've corrected it later on and at this point there's just so many streams it would be really hard to go back and correct everything so I totally understand that but I think like you say if you just give I mean I frequently give the disclaimer that you know this is just me doing this you know the best way I know how with with all you help from all of you you know if people understand that coming in that that's that that's what's going on here then I may I feel better about it at least you know I don't I don't claim that this is a tutorial you know so anyway but totally up to you certainly if you feel comfortable or not but it would be cool you know to see them so let me know when you when you do release them I'd like to check them out I said not really into doing anything with csharp but we do run some things with csharp here at the University I don't work on them but it'd be cool to know a little bit more about them just to understand how things how things work because occasionally I do have to help like like right now we're we're down one developer in the department that works on the csharp stuff so I have to help occasionally if something is like an emergency and really needs done alright so let's a sh says hey can we ask questions if we don't understand something yes definitely yeah so I'm gonna do some more coding but before I end I'm gonna go back through and see if there's any questions and and I'll answer them all before I finish the stream so let's do some more I'm not let's see how about I could for about ten more minutes and then I do questions and then that way I'll be I'll be finished in about an hour which I just don't want to push it cuz I don't want to lose my voice and I'm getting tired so I think the quality of my coding is going to go down quickly I can already feel it's like it's hard to focus all right I guess I should figure out what I'm gonna change first see that talking about that focus he difficult all right let me think of something that I can get done in ten minutes I guess I could check my shell award I guess that's done I'll doublecheck it I'll put it here actually let's let's work on this because I think this is really interesting and I've never tried this before and I have no idea if I can get it done in ten minutes but I'd like to just check it out so we before we had we set up our file upload and it's giving us a list and it was someone maybe Sebastian had had got this working and I think he was the one that suggested this I'm not 100% sure so sorry if I'm giving credit to the wrong person but let me show you what we're talking about so in our upload files lists you upload a few okay so we have I guess I need more that's a lot of them ok so right now it gets cut off and you can't see the rest right you can't do anything about it so it'd be cool to scroll normally I'm not a huge fan of horizontal scrolling but in this case it makes sense it makes more sense I think than having them wrapped because that would just mess up the spacing too so let's try to do a horizontal scroll hopefully this is as simple as just setting the overflow and if that's the case we can definitely get this done so let's see there we go but hmmm let's shout out overflow no she's not working I I doubt it would work to put it on here but let's let's try it actually we did have the overflowhidden no no it's not working and not really anything else I could do about that huh okay so this is just a text input and the only it's only job is just to hold these values right now so what if we made it a multiline text input it might wrap then right so it would be what a text area instead of an input let's uh let's try that I'm not sure about it like I said because that might end up changing the spacing but if I can't get the horizontal scroll then that's the next best thing I'll have to make sure see class file path hopefully everything is referencing this class name so that if I keep the same class name it should still work but yes there's one way to find out let's just do it much use that service requests okay so yeah there's a lot to this okay here's our file upload and there we go here's our input okay oops textarea and do we need a type on the tech series and I think we do see oh goodness well that that looks really ugly I'm not worried about that right now I'm just kind of worried about if it works what we'll need to do is is use the material UI excuse me let me tear you eye component for this instead of just changing its a text area some files hmm all right well that of course is not what we want but what should happen though if we're using this type of text arias it should expand so I'm hoping that we'll get it to expand like that let's see oops let's go back and text field okay I'm just gonna copy this and remove what we don't need let's get rid of this okay Suter looks like not dopes I never removed this one okay need some adjustment but doesn't look that bad so far yay all right that's so much better all right I like that I like that and I'm not super worried about the spacing like I thought I would be basically because the odds of some of the uploading this many files are slim so not that many people will even see it but even then it doesn't look terrible below is a whole new section so it would look a lot it would look weird if let's say it was right in the middle of here where you do have a uniform spacing and then all of a sudden it would change but because this space here only happens once it doesn't really seem like it's messed up now what I would like to do is make in relation to this upload button have this aligned a little bit better at the very least I want to have the top of this lined up with the top of this button probably best thing would be to have it centered but not bad and that works and I think do you need to doublecheck where else am i I don't think I'm that will affect anything else I was just kind of wondering about when I get all the values to send out in the email and send our project management system well I think it should be fine because it's the same eating the value from a text area and from an input field is the same as opposed to like getting a checkbox value or something okay that's cool I like that my timer went off so I'm gonna answer some questions now and off probably before I leave today I'll clean this up a bit and then commit that as well as I don't think I committed this yet where we lined up all of these up so I'll do that too and then that way everything on github will be up to date okay ash asks are there any repos of these projects on github or bitbucket I want to compare with my code to see if I'm doing something wrong and Joseph did say look in the description yeah so if if you want to follow along this is on github I do have the links in the descriptions to all the videos so feel free to check it out use it I have a few people who let me know that they're using what I'm doing on this project or the last project as the basis for one of their projects and I think that's awesome so yeah so feel free and okay Sebastian I mentioned early I thought it was Sebastian that had had done the the upload thing maybe it's not maybe it was Kevin yeah it was really early on it was a while ago so I can't remember exactly but we'll say keV I don't think Kevin's in the live chat now so we'll just say it was Kevin he can't he can't let us know I think Kevin hasn't been around the live set for a while he's working on his own project and he sent me a message a few days ago telling me about it so it's cool hopefully he'll get it to the point where he can share that and if he lets me maybe I can share a link with you all let's see like we have some more question here we go ash ash hey just by the way Jesse what's your coding background like did you go to uni or are you selftaught so yeah I do have a bachelor's degree but it's in business so I I took I did complete one C++ programming course but so that's the extent of my formal education maybe I did take a class in high school where we spent a couple weeks on basic HTML but I don't know that that really counts but other than that it's just been all online and mostly free resources I think I spent maybe $30 on udemy courses and until very recently until a few months ago when I signed up for the react nano degree like I literally had spent 30 dollars or less on courses the entire time that I've been doing this so big you know years I had spent that so which I I say that because it's it's really I think it's a really cool thing about this industry that someone with very little in terms of financial resources can learn enough and get a job doing this which I think that's awesome because so many other fields are like it's just hard to break into unless you're already wealthy because the cost to get in you know I'm thinking like if you want to be a doctor or a lawyer unless you want to go into a lot of debt you just you can't you can't do it you know you need me need so much money to be able to go go to school for that many years to get that the education you need so anyway I did give a also on my channel there's a link in the description that I think there's a link in the description to my channel otherwise you can just look up Jesse Weigel and it should come up on YouTube search but I did a video kind of going through my history of learning to be a frontend developer so if you want to know more check that out it's not it's not super long I think it's like 10 minutes so it's not really indepth but it'll give you kind of a nice overview of where I came from and how I got to where I am now ooh ooh Paul says business decoding so good that's pretty great yeah actually I don't I don't think I said this on a stream before or in my video but I guess I'll take the last minute here just to say this it may it may be helpful to somebody so when I was a teenager I had thought about doing coding I was always really good with computers and a lot of people said you know why don't you do computers I have an uncle who's a programmer and you know he would talk to me about it and I had decided I didn't want to do computers because I thought if I did computers I would just be stuck in a cubicle all day and I wouldn't get to talk to anybody and that would be my life I if you've ever seen the first Matrix movie where the main character that's literally he has this tiny little cubicle and he just types on his keyboard all day and it's it's terrible so that's the idea I had in my mind of what I would do and I said no like I don't really want to do that now hopefully probably some of you were laughing when you hear that because that's not at all what this is right so I had a mistaken view of what what this was all about and I probably would have been in this a lot earlier had I had I had a better view of things you know I mean now it seems were crazy because now you have like it's well known that Google's offices are really cool and you know I don't know things have changed I think in terms of the perception of what what coding is but you know at least when I was a teenager it wasn't like that so anyway so that's why I ended up going into business and because but I really was kind of into coding and they thought about it earlier so it's kind of cool that I ended up back here in the end and although I am actually sitting in an office by myself right now I'm talking to all of you so it's not like I'm somehow chained to a cubicle or anything like that anyway so I guess the the moral of my story if there is one is especially for those of you maybe who are younger this would be more helpful but don't don't dismiss something some you know a job or anything that you have interest in you know without really checking it out you know so like see if you can get an internship or like shadow somebody who does that job you know to really find out what it's like because now that I'm doing this I love it and it would have been really cool if I could have been doing this then you know some of the other jobs that I've had if nothing so great so I would have much rather done this then then the other things that I've done so anyway I think that's I've got all the questions so I'm gonna wrap things up and probably get out of here early and go take a nap I guess if mike my kids let me feel I was thinking that but oh well it's already Friday I was gonna say I'll see you tomorrow but it's it's Friday the whole week's been messed up for me I'm really thinking about it now it is Friday right yeah I just checked my calendar okay uhhuh so I will see you all on Monday and have a great weekend hopefully I'll be back to a hundred percent by Monday and I can get some some real work done on this thank you all so much for watching for all your help and have a great weekend
