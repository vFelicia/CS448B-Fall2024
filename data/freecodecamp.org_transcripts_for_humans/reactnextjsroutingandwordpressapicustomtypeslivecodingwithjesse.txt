00:07 - hey everybody its Jesse and uh today
00:12 - we're showing it a lot done
00:15 - and I actually want to try to get
00:17 - through like a whole a whole process
00:23 - usually I just work on random stuff and
00:26 - I don't always get it done so I want to
00:28 - go try to go start to finish and take
00:30 - you through the process of creating a
00:34 - custom post type in WordPress with
00:37 - custom fields populating that with some
00:41 - data getting that data pulling it into a
00:45 - reactor and we're gonna make a template
00:51 - in react to display that data and we
00:55 - want that a user to be able to go to a
00:58 - page and have that page automatically
01:00 - generated with a unique URL so we're
01:04 - gonna need to edit our server j/s file
01:06 - to be able to handle that so I want to
01:10 - get all of that done while I'm streaming
01:15 - so that's a lot of stuff but I've done
01:17 - it I don't want to say a lot but I've
01:22 - done it you know three or four times
01:25 - before you know recently so I think we
01:29 - can get it done I'm gonna check the live
01:36 - chat say hi hey everyone
01:43 - so I apologize in advance if I'm a
01:46 - little weird for this dream because I I
01:49 - only got like five hours of sleep last
01:51 - night
01:53 - so I was up I ended up not being super
01:58 - tired last night so I applied to speak
02:01 - at some conferences which is kind of
02:06 - exciting I've never applied to speak at
02:07 - conferences before so we'll see what
02:11 - happens
02:11 - I don't really know if I if my
02:14 - submissions were even any good because
02:16 - I've never even seen anyone's submission
02:19 - before but hopefully I at least get some
02:26 - good feedback you know even if I get
02:29 - rejected that would be kind of cool if
02:33 - you want to see my um what I submitted
02:37 - to some of the conference's it's
02:38 - available online so check my Twitter I
02:41 - sent out a link last night so that
02:44 - people could actually check out my idea
02:47 - for a talk and then this morning the
02:54 - baby was up really early so anyway that
02:57 - that's why I didn't get sleep but I'm
03:02 - gonna try my best to stay focused I do
03:05 - have one question for you all to start
03:09 - someone asks what my Twitter handle was
03:11 - Jeremy asks it's it's in the description
03:15 - for this show it's just it's Jesse are
03:18 - Weigel so jay esse r w e i GTL
03:29 - and let me I had one problem so I really
03:36 - wanted to get you all a link that you
03:39 - could go to to see all the updates so I
03:42 - started a dev branch that's gonna be
03:44 - like the cutting edge stuff the latest
03:47 - stuff that we're doing for this site and
03:49 - that is going to be updated at our
03:53 - server I don't know if anybody remembers
03:54 - when we set up the load balancing but we
03:58 - actually have three droplets running
04:01 - node and react and we are only a load
04:04 - balancing between two so I never shut
04:06 - down that third droplet because I always
04:09 - thought it would come in handy for
04:10 - testing and today it has come in handy
04:13 - so that's the droplet that I can just
04:17 - give you the IP address for and you all
04:19 - can can check it out now I did get it
04:22 - working but I just tried to update it
04:29 - and for some reason it quit working now
04:31 - here's what I think happened my session
04:34 - timed out when I was used logged into
04:37 - the server and I didn't use usually used
04:41 - p.m. to to start the server but I didn't
04:43 - even set it up I just started it you
04:45 - know with just a regular command just
04:48 - npm run start and I never shut down the
04:50 - server so right now I can't start the
04:52 - new server because port 8080 is already
04:55 - in use so normally I would shut it down
04:57 - by pressing ctrl C right but that
05:00 - doesn't work because at least I don't
05:04 - think it works
05:05 - I can sure you double check but I don't
05:08 - think that's gonna work for me yeah how
05:11 - do you shut down a node server from the
05:14 - command line if it's not actually like
05:18 - the process is not actually running in
05:20 - my command line right now like I'm I
05:21 - can't see it so if anybody knows how to
05:25 - do that let me know and then I can get
05:27 - this up and running and you all can have
05:29 - a place where you can check out all the
05:32 - latest stuff without having to download
05:34 - this repository and run a local server
05:38 - so I
05:40 - I'll figure it out eventually but I just
05:43 - figured maybe somebody is really
05:46 - familiar with node and just knows
05:48 - exactly what command I need okay Patrick
05:53 - did have Patrick had a good comment he
06:01 - asked about the on change event with
06:04 - materialized so okay cool so I've gotten
06:11 - the the command so let's go sudo kill
06:20 - all node is that it
06:38 - which other so anyway yesterday we
06:43 - couldn't I couldn't get this select
06:46 - thing to work and I said that I would
06:50 - let you all know how I ended up getting
06:51 - it to work so let me let me do that now
06:54 - all right cool
06:56 - so that works so if you go to let me
07:00 - find the IP for you
07:05 - I'll paste this IP address in the live
07:09 - chat and it's the IP address is 1 6 2.2
07:18 - 4 3.8 6.67 and maybe if I can remember
07:24 - I'll put it in the shared description so
07:27 - anyway this will show the latest stuff
07:31 - so this will actually show you that this
07:34 - is working now all right so the only
07:37 - thing this is the only thing that
07:39 - actually has a working category right
07:41 - now I'm pretty sure nothing else has
07:44 - been put into categories but that is
07:47 - working I'll show you how I got it
07:48 - working in a second
07:50 - also for some reason these borders on
07:56 - this top one just start coming and going
07:58 - I haven't replaced the borders with hrs
08:01 - yet so I need to do that but I did get
08:03 - this working so I have this little
08:08 - toggle here and this is just changing
08:12 - the state within the component so within
08:15 - the component there's a display content
08:17 - set automatically to false if it's false
08:20 - it displays this when you click it it
08:22 - sets the state to true and displays the
08:26 - Falaise this and this one when you click
08:29 - it it sets the state back to false so
08:33 - let me show you the code for how I got
08:38 - this working and then we'll get started
08:42 - on on what I actually described in the
08:47 - title in the description for this video
08:48 - so
08:51 - within that's material select that's
08:58 - what we have so within material select
09:03 - what I've done is basically just gotten
09:06 - rid of all the materialized stuff so I'm
09:08 - not initializing the materialized I
09:11 - should give some background in case you
09:12 - weren't watching yesterday and you're
09:17 - not sure what I'm talking about I'm
09:20 - using the materialized framework it's a
09:22 - CSS framework it uses some jQuery stuff
09:26 - and changes the Dom so it's not ideal
09:29 - for react but we've made it work so far
09:33 - and this is the only time we've run into
09:36 - an issue where I just couldn't get it to
09:38 - work I was spending way too much time
09:40 - yesterday getting it to work I probably
09:42 - should have given up on it sooner but it
09:46 - just didn't even occur to me during the
09:50 - stream until the very end so what I did
09:52 - normally what materialized does is if
09:54 - you have a select input it goes through
09:57 - all the options and then it creates new
10:00 - Dom nodes for new elements and it
10:02 - creates a new ul and then each option
10:05 - becomes an Li within that ul so that all
10:09 - happens after you know with with jQuery
10:12 - so that's not really registered in react
10:17 - now that wasn't even the main issue so
10:20 - that was one issue but the main issue
10:22 - was that whenever we changed that select
10:30 - input that event wasn't registering for
10:35 - react so when I try to have this on
10:37 - change handler to do something it
10:42 - wouldn't do anything it didn't recognize
10:44 - the change it would actually run it was
10:47 - weird it would run twice on render that
10:50 - was because it would actually render
10:52 - once and run and then it would make an
10:56 - API call to populate all these options
10:58 - and then re render and then we'll run
11:00 - another time but then when I actually
11:01 - tried to change
11:02 - the select input to select one of these
11:05 - options it wouldn't fire off an event so
11:09 - that's that's an issue with materialized
11:12 - and and react so I think that the issue
11:16 - is probably on the side of materialized
11:18 - and how it's done it's not I don't think
11:21 - it's a react issue from what I can
11:22 - understand there were some some pool
11:28 - requests to try to fix that but I don't
11:30 - think that it seems like the maintainer
11:31 - zuv materialized don't see that as a bug
11:35 - and they just recommended using the
11:38 - react materialized framework which is an
11:43 - attempt to make materialized work with
11:46 - react and turn everything into react
11:48 - components so so I don't think there's
11:53 - any chance anytime soon of that being
11:56 - changed so just in case you're trying to
11:59 - use materialized as well you can either
12:01 - go the route that I did or you can try
12:04 - to use react materialize instead or try
12:07 - to do some type of custom fix but I'll
12:11 - show you you know basically what I did
12:12 - is now I'm using just a plain select
12:15 - input I did do some extra styling so I
12:19 - could make it fit in so let me show you
12:23 - I mean obviously this doesn't look like
12:26 - your default select input when you click
12:28 - it this looks like browser default right
12:30 - I can't really do much about this
12:33 - browser default and it'll look slightly
12:34 - different depending on the browser but
12:38 - you know assuming I want to stick with a
12:40 - select input and not try to do something
12:41 - some type of custom list which I don't
12:45 - really want to do it right now it would
12:46 - be okay but it would be a lot of work I
12:48 - think for a slight improvement and I'm
12:50 - running out of time to work on this site
12:53 - so I just changed things so that it
12:56 - mimics the look of this search box okay
13:01 - so and how I accomplished that was with
13:07 - all of this it's really big mostly
13:12 - because of all these vendor prefixes
13:15 - which
13:16 - I think if you put things within the
13:18 - style JSX tag it actually Auto prefixes
13:21 - for you but I had copied this over from
13:23 - a previous project where I had figured
13:25 - out everything I need to do to style
13:28 - this in the materialized fashion so I
13:32 - didn't I didn't try to redo that I just
13:34 - copied it over so it's not hurting
13:36 - anything to have the vendor prefixes in
13:37 - there and it's working so I'm not gonna
13:39 - mess with it and then I just needed to
13:41 - add in this this part at the bottom let
13:47 - me bring make this a bit bigger I think
13:49 - is this is a bit smaller than I normally
13:50 - have it so I had to add in this the
13:52 - reason I couldn't put it right here in
13:54 - the style JSX
13:55 - tag was because of this so it thought I
14:00 - was trying to incorrectly escape
14:02 - something within this string because of
14:05 - the slash so it wouldn't work so if you
14:08 - try to use content and then you know one
14:10 - of these this basically makes that that
14:16 - little try upside down triangle they
14:18 - call it a carrot that's the little code
14:22 - to make that so if you're trying to do
14:24 - something like that it won't work in
14:25 - style of JSX so this code is all on
14:32 - github you can check it out under the
14:35 - dev branch so if you want to kind of
14:38 - look into how I did this place it's not
14:43 - really a lot it just looks like a lot
14:45 - because the vendor prefixes and a lot of
14:47 - it is just trying to override browser
14:49 - default things all right so that's
14:53 - pretty much it I'm gonna check the live
14:54 - stream now see if there's any questions
14:57 - about that before we get started
15:05 - okay we have somebody card carnage I'm
15:09 - not sure how to pronounce the name kar
15:11 - IE KR n IE j carnage I don't know
15:16 - sorry about not know not to pronounce
15:18 - that but anyway says hi everybody I'm
15:20 - looking for a job react job so I guess
15:27 - so hopefully you you can pick up some
15:29 - react knowledge on this stream if
15:33 - anything you can probably pick up some
15:37 - mistakes to avoid when you when you do
15:41 - this my stream is really good at
15:43 - demonstrating the pitfalls and mistakes
15:46 - that can be made and sometimes even how
15:48 - to fix them but anyway I'm not sure that
15:53 - anybody watching now or in the live chat
15:56 - is hiring so I don't know that I can
15:57 - help you but anyway I keep keep us
16:03 - updated on the job search I'd love to
16:06 - hear how it goes okay
16:10 - the will Frank says long time viewer
16:13 - first day hey how's it going thanks for
16:17 - saying hi I realized there's probably a
16:19 - lot of people who watch who never speak
16:22 - in a live chat which is totally cool I'm
16:24 - actually am usually pretty quiet and
16:27 - chats and things myself when I'm
16:29 - watching so I totally understand
16:30 - and maybe you're just doing other things
16:32 - and not a computer yours feel like
16:35 - listening or watching
16:36 - but don't be shy if you can if you can
16:40 - say hi that would be cool because I
16:43 - noticed you know there's always the the
16:45 - analytics shows that there's always way
16:48 - more viewers than people talking in the
16:51 - live chat and today we actually have
16:54 - fewer of yours than we've been having
16:56 - normally so I don't know what happened
16:59 - maybe the topic is not great today it's
17:04 - still a decent amount of years though so
17:07 - I think we have like 40 right now which
17:09 - is I mean that's I'm always amazed that
17:12 - anybody wants to watch me cuz
17:15 - forty or forty three now cool person I
17:22 - see react a Fabian how's it going
17:33 - haha Evo says hi Jesse not James's son
17:37 - hey how's it going that yesterday Evo
17:44 - accidentally called me James in the chat
17:46 - which was just fine that it didn't
17:49 - bother me bill says hey it worked but
17:53 - listening in the background today
17:54 - awesome
17:56 - that's that's cool that's why I imagine
17:58 - that's probably a lot of people may be
18:00 - in the same situation especially if
18:02 - they're in a similar time zone to where
18:04 - I'm at because this is the time when
18:06 - people are normally at work
18:19 - John said is it not always with the more
18:22 - simple coding it saves the day all these
18:23 - things like reactor webpack other
18:25 - complex systems for me at least now is
18:28 - overkill yeah I I agree to some extent
18:31 - that I'll react webpack all that stuff
18:36 - increases the complexity and increases
18:39 - the possibility for bugs so if you don't
18:42 - need to use those things for what you're
18:45 - trying to accomplish you you are
18:47 - probably better off not using them but
18:51 - for a lot even you know if you're trying
18:52 - to learn them there's no reason not to
18:55 - do a small project with it because if if
18:57 - your purpose is not just to produce a
19:00 - product if your purpose is to learn then
19:03 - you know make something simple with
19:05 - react I I actually uh a few weeks ago
19:08 - when I was on vacation I built the free
19:11 - code camp weather app I don't know if
19:14 - you all remember that challenge is kind
19:15 - of early on in free code camp challenges
19:17 - but I built that I rebuild it and react
19:20 - I had built it once just with some
19:23 - jQuery and I did it just simply to get
19:26 - some practice and to learn it definitely
19:28 - doesn't need to be built and react but
19:30 - but anyway to speak to John's point that
19:34 - definitely was the case this time with
19:37 - materialize it was trying to do all this
19:39 - other stuff and beyond what a normal
19:42 - select input does and you know the
19:43 - select input that's been in HTML for for
19:46 - years and years worked fine for this use
19:49 - case so it was definitely the solution
19:51 - and better off hey Zanna says hi hey
19:54 - how's it going glad you can watch Jordan
19:59 - asks how do you hook up WordPress with
20:01 - react okay cool I'm going to show you
20:02 - today how we hook up WordPress with
20:05 - react so I'm not going to explain it
20:06 - right now because we're I'll be able to
20:08 - show it to you we're gonna do it during
20:12 - this this stream and I'll start that in
20:15 - just a minute I just wanted to say hi to
20:16 - everybody and you know at the beginning
20:19 - of the live chat before I get get to the
20:22 - code ego says John if you have this many
20:28 - modules of stuff to keep track of a tool
20:30 - like web pack is a lifesaver react
20:32 - is also really nice and I think that
20:33 - they will become even more prevalent
20:35 - yeah that's true that's a good point you
20:39 - know like if your project is complex it
20:42 - ends up helping to have things like
20:44 - react and webpack like yesterday I
20:47 - showed you all that I think it was
20:49 - yesterday I showed you all that mess
20:51 - that was the the jQuery site that I had
20:54 - made which basically did a lot of the
20:56 - same stuff that this site does but I
20:58 - built it all with jQuery and it was just
21:00 - a bunch of crazy spaghetti code and it's
21:02 - really hard to maintain now I really
21:05 - can't wait until I have the time to
21:07 - rebuild that in react
21:08 - so in that case using something simpler
21:13 - than react which was I would argue that
21:16 - jQuery is probably simpler than react at
21:18 - least it's simpler to learn but that
21:23 - ended up being worse as the project got
21:26 - more complex so I think there ends
21:28 - there's a tipping point in the project
21:30 - of you know where some of these tools
21:35 - actually do end up helping Zanna asks
21:41 - did you debug it Zen are you talking
21:45 - about the the select input thing that
21:48 - was happening so I don't know maybe you
21:51 - might have joined in right after I
21:52 - explained it so sorry if you missed it
21:56 - but basically yeah I did get it working
21:57 - and I just went with a normal select
21:59 - input so I just got rid of the stuff
22:04 - that materialized was glowing and just
22:05 - went with a normal select input
22:06 - everything worked fine and I just did
22:08 - some styling to make it look like it was
22:14 - it fit with the materialize styling
22:23 - all right so think I'm gonna I'm gonna
22:26 - scan through quickly the rest to see on
22:28 - the live chat and then I'm gonna get
22:29 - started
22:38 - okay bill bill said he watched the
22:42 - replays of the last two streams and at
22:44 - one point in yesterday's streams I
22:46 - accidentally showed his project instead
22:49 - of my project and he says it's cool
22:52 - though because it was on github as
22:53 - open-source so yeah sorry about that I
22:55 - mean I'm glad that it's cool and
22:57 - everything but I'll have to be more
22:59 - careful about double-checking what I
23:01 - show I try to keep everything that
23:05 - shouldn't be shown on my other screens
23:19 - okay so they all go asks about the Auto
23:24 - prefixing the CSS inside the JSX
23:28 - I'm not sure I think the I think if you
23:33 - use next J s the Auto prefixing
23:36 - everything comes built-in so I I don't
23:44 - know I have to check it out I just
23:46 - always assumed it was Auto prefixing I
23:48 - thought I saw that before in my code
23:50 - that it was all in a prefix but now that
23:53 - I really think about it I would have to
23:54 - double check to say 100% for sure so
23:57 - don't take my word for it without
23:59 - double-checking but I'm pretty sure it
24:02 - does get Auto prefixed as long as it's
24:04 - inside the style da J or the style JSX
24:07 - tags okay okay so Zanna did didn't hear
24:11 - the explanation the beginning so I gave
24:14 - us a slightly longer explanation and I
24:16 - showed the code so Zanna if you if you
24:19 - get a chance later on you can watch like
24:21 - the first 10 minutes of the stream or
24:22 - something the recording and get a longer
24:27 - explanation
24:44 - okay I'll wait - Patrick centerlink
24:48 - what's the link Patrick I'll check it
24:51 - out of my sheep
25:02 - okay
25:10 - that's weird okay so this should check
25:14 - this out I'm probably not gonna fix this
25:19 - right now I'll do it later since I want
25:21 - to do something else on the stream but
25:23 - Patrick just sent this
25:24 - so what browser was that that's it on
25:26 - Ubuntu with with chrome okay
25:33 - well that's no good so I'll have to work
25:39 - on that Danny but if anybody else
25:43 - checked this out let me know if you're
25:46 - having anything similar happening
25:51 - obviously like Chrome on a Mac it looks
25:55 - like this it works blown on Ubuntu it
25:59 - looks like this I mean I really want it
26:03 - to work but realistically there's
26:06 - probably no actual user of this site
26:09 - who's like in the target audience that
26:11 - would be using Ubuntu so if that's the
26:13 - only place where this happens I probably
26:15 - won't worry about it just because I
26:19 - don't have a lot of time yet so I gotta
26:21 - worry about you know the other browsers
26:24 - more browser
26:27 - operating system combinations more but
26:31 - yeah I'm gonna have to take a look at
26:33 - that although I really won't have a good
26:35 - way to test it because I don't I don't
26:37 - have Kubuntu and I don't even think you
26:41 - can test that on browser stack off to
26:45 - check I don't think you can test it on
26:46 - Linux let's see
26:57 - okay Patrick just said the same thing
27:01 - that there's not a lot of site people
27:03 - going to the site with Linux okay it's
27:08 - good to know the and I'm definitely
27:10 - going to check it out with some other
27:12 - combinations of operating systems and
27:16 - browsers devices to make sure that
27:18 - there's not similar errors happening
27:20 - elsewhere so thanks for sending that so
27:28 - Oh actually I did want to before I
27:31 - started I wanted to mention a little bit
27:35 - about the net neutrality thing that's
27:37 - happening so especially for those in in
27:42 - the United States right now there's like
27:46 - some the federal government has some
27:50 - stuff going on where basically it could
27:52 - end up being really bad for the internet
27:54 - like things could be blocked like so I
28:00 - wanted to show some of you may have
28:04 - already seen this but there's these
28:07 - videos that are they're really short so
28:10 - I think I'm just going to show this
28:11 - video quickly this net neutrality video
28:13 - which we'll be able to kind of explain
28:14 - things a lot better than I can and let
28:22 - me try to bring this over I think it's
28:25 - just only a few minutes so let me throw
28:31 - this on here yeah oh it's not even it's
28:34 - 33 seconds so
29:03 - okay so anyway that was just a really
29:07 - basic of what's happening so if you're
29:12 - if you're interested and just putting
29:15 - your name out there as being against
29:18 - this then you know check out the the URL
29:22 - which was battle for the Netcom so and
29:32 - today is like the official day I think
29:34 - where a lot of stuff is happening to
29:37 - raise awareness and kind of protest that
29:40 - possibility of the internet being you
29:43 - know way more regulated by companies and
29:48 - different than it than it is now and
29:50 - then it probably should be alright let's
29:58 - see I just want to check the live chat
30:02 - really quick to see what other errors
30:05 - you are getting
30:09 - okay so Windows 10 in chrome is the same
30:13 - issue so okay so Evo says Evo's found
30:24 - the error already which is awesome thank
30:26 - you so much you have a color value of
30:28 - inherit in the CSS rule button for input
30:31 - select area which comes from
30:33 - materialized okay alright so evidently
30:36 - there's something being being applied
30:40 - from materialize the materialized
30:43 - framework that's affecting that so
30:51 - oh so I'll check that out
31:06 - okay let me open post the link to the
31:08 - dev site again for for those either came
31:12 - in a little bit later so I have a 1/3
31:19 - droplet now that's running the dev
31:22 - branch so I'll try to keep it updated
31:25 - with the latest dev stuff so until I get
31:29 - approval for the changes from the people
31:33 - higher up than they I'm not gonna make
31:35 - them since they're really significant
31:37 - changes for for a lot of pages I'm not
31:40 - I'm not just gonna try to make them live
31:42 - on my own I need to get some approval
31:44 - first so for now they're gonna exist
31:47 - only on this at this IP address and okay
31:54 - cool Evo is gonna open a github issue
31:57 - with an explanation of what's going on
32:00 - with that select input so I'll
32:03 - definitely check that out and actually
32:07 - if anyone is kind of shaky with the
32:10 - JavaScript skills but is really good
32:11 - with their CSS that will probably end up
32:14 - being a CSS only solution that might be
32:19 - good to contribute so otherwise I mean
32:21 - I'm I'm sure it'd only take me a few
32:23 - minutes to figure it out
32:24 - but especially for new people who are
32:27 - trying to get some some more things on
32:30 - the github profile that might be kind of
32:32 - an easy thing to do so enough of this
32:38 - we're gonna work on something totally
32:40 - different so I'm gonna move this off the
32:44 - screen and I'm gonna do this off the
32:47 - screen and what a bunch of stuff off the
32:50 - screen I can keep this on the screen
33:01 - also yesterday one more thing just
33:08 - continuing from yesterday yesterday I
33:11 - had a pool request from Rene which
33:14 - switched over to using pre-act instead
33:18 - of react and it made things smaller the
33:21 - bundle size for production was smaller a
33:23 - lot smaller so when I tried to use it on
33:28 - this test server I was getting an error
33:31 - I was saying R is not a function so I'm
33:37 - not sure what was going on it worked
33:39 - fine locally but when I tried to
33:41 - actually build it and run it I was
33:43 - getting there so I ended up not merging
33:47 - that pool request I didn't accept it yet
33:49 - I'm not saying I won't accept it but I
33:51 - just need to get it working on the
33:53 - actual server first so so I added I
34:00 - added that to to the actual pool request
34:07 - I added a comment about it so if anybody
34:10 - has any ideas for that you know please
34:13 - you know comment there on that on that
34:18 - pool request on github ok so today what
34:25 - we're gonna do
34:26 - let's start with WordPress first so I'm
34:29 - gonna do I'm gonna start here in our
34:33 - WordPress plugin
34:34 - so you've probably seen this before
34:38 - this is a wordpress plugin that we're
34:40 - using to make a bunch of custom post
34:43 - types so here's what we what we need to
34:46 - do here's the the kind of the end goal
34:48 - for the user the user needs to be able
34:51 - to click on a link that will be like the
34:57 - title of a PDF document right so in the
35:01 - about page we're going to create
35:03 - something to display these links some
35:05 - new section but I don't want them to
35:09 - just link to PDF documents right because
35:11 - that's that's no good for
35:14 - search engine optimization I'm not
35:16 - really sure how screen readers handle
35:17 - that so I'd rather have these PDFs
35:20 - converted into HTML but I also want the
35:25 - PDFs available to download so I'd like a
35:26 - user to be able to go to the about page
35:28 - see a list of the titles of these PDFs
35:31 - click on it when they click it opens up
35:34 - an entirely new page on a react site
35:38 - that has the contents of that PDF in
35:43 - HTML and then also has a button to be
35:48 - able to download the PDF and I want that
35:52 - all to be editable from within WordPress
35:55 - so we're gonna make a custom post type I
35:59 - guess a PDF page post type and it needs
36:04 - to have your normal title and content
36:08 - fields which are there by default but
36:11 - then we're gonna add one custom field
36:12 - that's going to be the URL of the PDF
36:19 - and actually we should probably might
36:22 - want to do the title field should be
36:26 - good I kind of thought maybe we might
36:28 - want to do a separate field for PDF
36:30 - title but I think the title field should
36:32 - be enough that we could pull into use
36:34 - for the link text so that should that's
36:39 - all we need to do on the wordpress side
36:41 - and then we'll come in we'll build the
36:44 - the page that that's going to be
36:46 - populated we'll build out the section
36:49 - that needs to be in the about page and
36:52 - then we'll update our code in our server
36:55 - das file to direct people to the right
37:02 - place and make the right API call to get
37:06 - that data so let me
37:13 - copy so I think you you I've done this
37:19 - before on a stream so I'm just gonna
37:22 - copy this did I get the I don't know if
37:26 - I got the top part so I'm doing it again
37:28 - so I'm going to copy this and paste it
37:30 - now I'm just gonna change all of these
37:43 - and I wanted to say instead what did I
37:48 - say was a PDF PDF page yeah I think
37:56 - that'll I think that'll be obvious to
38:00 - the people who are editing it what I
38:02 - would that is okay so this is how it
38:07 - will display these are all the display
38:08 - names that'll be like in the WordPress
38:10 - admin panel and then these are the names
38:15 - that'll be in the code so let's make PDF
38:38 - all right so now I'm gonna say that oops
38:42 - actually I'm not gonna save it okay copy
38:45 - this let me bring over my WordPress
38:50 - admin panel here so I need to login I
38:57 - just let me bring this over and I need
39:01 - to upgrade to the newest version so I
39:04 - was just waiting to do a backup so I
39:06 - have one of my co-workers purchase a
39:10 - subscription for this backup plug-in
39:12 - that we can use on and I think an
39:14 - unlimited amount of site so I'm just
39:15 - waiting to get the info about how to
39:18 - install that because generally you don't
39:21 - want to really do too many updates on a
39:23 - wordpress site without backing it up
39:24 - I've done a lot of updates on small
39:27 - sites without backing up and I've never
39:29 - actually had anything happen but it's a
39:32 - good practice to to do the backups if
39:36 - you can so you can manually you don't
39:40 - need a plug-in you can manually do the
39:42 - backups but I don't have like PHP
39:45 - myadmin installed or anything like that
39:47 - so I just I don't really feel like doing
39:49 - the backups from the command line and
39:50 - I'm not even sure I have SSH access to
39:53 - this droplet so let's go actually that I
40:00 - have no idea why that I've keeping this
40:03 - so small we'll make it a bit bigger and
40:05 - I'll increase the size so y'all can see
40:08 - what's going on so I'm gonna go into
40:10 - plugins here and I'm gonna find I passed
40:18 - it up there you see I custom types
40:21 - that's our plug-in and I'm gonna edit
40:24 - now if I did have I don't I don't really
40:27 - have any access to this server either
40:30 - FTP access or SSH for some reason the
40:34 - accesses and it isn't working I didn't
40:37 - set this up someone else set it up and
40:39 - so I just never figured out what the
40:42 - issue was so this is why I'm updating
40:43 - the plug-in like this normally I
40:46 - wouldn't update like this I would
40:48 - probably probably use FTP
40:52 - and just open the file directly in my
40:54 - editor but this works too so all I've
40:57 - done is just copy and paste of the new
40:59 - stuff I'm going to update it also I mean
41:03 - normally it wouldn't be a great idea to
41:05 - update stuff on a live WordPress
41:07 - installation anyway I'm pretty confident
41:10 - though since we we changed a minor thing
41:13 - that it should be fun and since
41:16 - everything if you mess up something in a
41:20 - plug-in you like very quickly realize
41:21 - that you mess it up in WordPress like
41:23 - you'll get this white I think it's like
41:25 - a white screen or something and you
41:28 - can't log in your site so if that
41:30 - happens you want to go in with FTP or
41:34 - SSH whatever you can and just rename the
41:38 - plug-in folder of the plug-in that you
41:41 - just changed is causing the problem and
41:43 - then that'll let you get back at least
41:45 - into your site and have your site
41:46 - running again and then you can revert to
41:50 - a previous version or whatever you
41:52 - change you can revert it back and try to
41:53 - figure it out best thing to do would be
41:57 - to have a a dev version of WordPress
42:01 - that you can test it out on first which
42:03 - I did not have set up for this yet but I
42:07 - may end up setting it up at some point
42:12 - so let's check out our PDF pages alright
42:19 - so now we have our PDF pages so you can
42:25 - see it's just like a normal wordpress
42:27 - post right just basic stuff we do want
42:30 - to add one field though and for that I'm
42:33 - gonna use a plug and I'm not gonna
42:34 - custom code that so let's get on our
42:37 - custom fields plugin
42:43 - and we're gonna add a new group and
42:49 - we'll call this PDF page info and I'm
42:56 - gonna we're going to make sure that it
42:57 - shows that it only applies when the post
43:01 - type is equal to PDF page I'm gonna add
43:05 - a field the field label is going to be
43:12 - actually I was gonna make it PDF URL but
43:15 - it should probably be an upload so let
43:23 - me see file
43:37 - okay so we will upload that I kind of
43:40 - didn't want to at first because I wasn't
43:43 - sure I wanted to have all the PDFs
43:44 - hosted there on the site but they'll
43:49 - probably be less room for error if the
43:53 - PDF just gets uploaded and I can pull
43:55 - the URL otherwise it's gonna be someone
44:00 - manually copying and pasting or typing
44:03 - out a URL and then two things could
44:06 - happen that I could see either they mess
44:08 - up the URL and it doesn't work or
44:11 - something happens to the place where
44:13 - that PDF is hosted so even if just the
44:17 - change in the file name occurred then
44:19 - the link wouldn't work anymore or that
44:21 - server could be down or something so it
44:23 - probably is better if we just have the
44:28 - PDF there it within the WordPress and
44:33 - it's a droplet on digitalocean I could
44:36 - always upgrade the storage if I need to
44:38 - if things start to get crazy
44:40 - I don't really anticipate that that much
44:43 - will get uploaded that I would need to
44:45 - upgrade stores so this should probably
44:52 - I'm actually not I'm not gonna require
44:56 - this because the way we're gonna display
44:58 - this the way I want to display this is I
45:03 - want these pages to be just
45:04 - informational pages so it's not gonna
45:08 - say right away that these are just PDF
45:11 - conversions the PDFs almost gonna be
45:13 - like an afterthought like if you want
45:15 - the PDF version here it is so in case
45:19 - there's at some point down the road they
45:22 - want to just include some information in
45:24 - this page without actually include
45:26 - having a PDF version I'm gonna make this
45:28 - not required and I want to return the
45:34 - file URL
45:40 - and that should be it
45:45 - now we can let's see I want to put this
45:53 - up high after the title so it's really
45:55 - obvious I do want to put this in the
45:59 - standard meta box I think the seamless
46:01 - kind of looks a bit nicer but it's more
46:05 - familiar for users to put it in the
46:06 - standard box so what what I don't need
46:11 - here so I want to hide the permalink I
46:18 - want to keep the content editor so when
46:21 - we're only using WordPress for the API
46:23 - we can hide a lot of things because they
46:25 - won't really work so we don't need the
46:29 - exurbs we don't need the custom fields
46:33 - because this isn't talking about the
46:34 - custom field we just made this would
46:36 - have been if we if we added custom
46:38 - fields through WordPress has kind of
46:40 - like a built-in way to do custom fields
46:42 - that's not nearly as user-friendly and
46:45 - powerful as this plugin
46:47 - we don't need discussion comments
46:50 - revisions could be helpful the slug is
46:55 - unnecessary authors unnecessary format
47:02 - I'm gonna hide featured image for now I
47:07 - don't think we'll be including images at
47:10 - least a featured image and I'm not gonna
47:15 - worry about categories or tags and
47:17 - another track back so this is going to
47:19 - simplify the UI significantly so you'll
47:22 - see when we go back in there will be a
47:24 - lot less than there was originally so
47:29 - I'm going to publish that and now let's
47:32 - go back in we'll add a new page okay see
47:38 - so here's our file input so we can add a
47:41 - file and actually this PDF I'm just
47:46 - gonna put this PDF in just a little
47:48 - have something and let's add a title
47:54 - test page and let's grab some just some
48:04 - some text to throw in there
48:15 - and I just grabbed some some bacon ipsum
48:22 - which is a taste to your version of
48:24 - lorem ipsum we don't really need the
48:31 - sharing buttons but I didn't see an
48:32 - option to get rid of these so I'm not
48:34 - worried about it now it won't make a
48:35 - difference whether this is checked or
48:37 - not but we can see you know really
48:41 - there's it's really simple for people to
48:43 - edit things in here there's not much
48:45 - that can be done so I'm gonna publish
48:47 - this and that's all we need to do on the
48:54 - wordpress side of things so it should be
49:01 - it should be enough for us just to have
49:03 - this one instance of it we kinda think
49:13 - there's really only one spot where we
49:14 - would display more than one set of data
49:16 - and that's that's one the about page so
49:20 - we may have to just hard code in some
49:23 - some other examples just to see what it
49:25 - will look like but this should be fine
49:28 - for now
49:30 - so that's it for the wordpress side of
49:32 - things and we'll check out the wordpress
49:37 - api now just to make sure that we're
49:40 - getting the data and as soon as you see
49:44 - the data I'm gonna go I'm gonna check
49:46 - back in the live stream because that's
49:47 - kind of the end of part one of our
49:50 - little mini project here so I want to
49:53 - check out the PDF pages oops
49:59 - was a PDF page there we go PDF page so
50:05 - here we go so when we make an API call
50:09 - to get a PDF page this is what we'll get
50:13 - back we actually don't need all of this
50:15 - data so we'll probably filter it down
50:17 - because we'll just need the content and
50:21 - we'll get the URL here we go here's our
50:28 - PDF upload URL so that's pretty much all
50:34 - we need and the title alright so we have
50:41 - that and I can move this over I don't
50:44 - think we need it anymore now I'm gonna
50:51 - go to the live chat quickly next step is
50:53 - going to be editing our about page to
50:58 - give users somewhere to actually click
51:00 - to get to our new page that we're gonna
51:03 - make all right so I'm gonna scroll up a
51:07 - bit in a live chat see what I missed
51:15 - okay Evo just added the github issue
51:18 - thank you so much for that the issue
51:20 - about the appearance of the Select okay
51:26 - Jeremy is bringing up there's a slack
51:29 - channel now for for free code camp
51:38 - it's FCC pair programming slack calm and
51:46 - Joe says FCC just keeps getting better
51:48 - every day
51:49 - awesome I like that that comment
52:00 - okay it looks like Zanna has included
52:05 - some images of that select input as well
52:10 - from Ubuntu on Firefox and Chrome okay
52:15 - so it looks like on Firefox it actually
52:17 - is working I'll put it on the screen
52:21 - quickly so it's working but it's black
52:24 - in the background so this might be a
52:26 - little bit more challenging than I
52:28 - thought because you know the we need it
52:33 - to show up the text to show up is white
52:35 - when it's selected and we can't just
52:39 - simply make it black because it wouldn't
52:42 - show up in Firefox so off to think that
52:44 - one through a bit more to make sure that
52:50 - the text is readable I'm trying to think
52:55 - the last time I did this it was on a
52:58 - white background so I didn't have the
53:00 - same issues I mean as possible I could
53:07 - just change this so that it's not on a
53:09 - black background anymore if I can't find
53:11 - some way to make this work and then that
53:16 - would just solve the issues because we
53:18 - would have a dark-colored font and it
53:20 - should work all the time because this
53:22 - this then would have a white background
53:24 - instead so anyway we'll see actually
53:27 - what do you all think about this black
53:29 - bar anyway so I've gotten some feedback
53:33 - from co-workers and the feedback so far
53:36 - was at first it was a little jarring but
53:39 - it only took you know a minute or so to
53:41 - get used to it and then it was it was
53:43 - okay so not great feedback I mean I
53:48 - would rather have wow this looks amazing
53:51 - so I'm not I'm still not sure about it
53:55 - myself now that I've been looking at it
53:56 - for so long I'm used to it but I just
53:59 - kind of I didn't want to just all white
54:02 - you know I wanted something else here to
54:05 - kind of set these off you know these
54:09 - controls these filters off from the rest
54:12 - of the content
54:13 - so if anyone has any other ideas let me
54:16 - know and I'm definitely open to some
54:22 - alternatives I mean I need to be careful
54:24 - I can't spend too much on it so if it's
54:27 - at a point where it's good enough I'll
54:29 - probably just have to leave it because
54:31 - we're running out of time so I don't I
54:33 - don't really want to mess with it too
54:35 - much but a color change shouldn't be
54:37 - that big of a deal you know if I really
54:41 - find a color that that I like I'm open
54:44 - to spending the time to change it
54:53 - okay yeah and so in regard to the slack
54:56 - Channel yeah I can't so a few people are
55:02 - saying they couldn't get into the slack
55:04 - Channel they need an invitation or
55:05 - something I had the same issue I
55:07 - couldn't get into the slack Channel
55:09 - either let me I think I still have it up
55:13 - on my screen somewhere at least I did
55:17 - I've way too many windows open I'm not
55:20 - sure here it is I find it yeah so this
55:27 - is what I'm getting sign-in to FCC pair
55:30 - programming and when I try to sign-in I
55:33 - can't
55:35 - so it says contact the team
55:37 - administrator and I'm not sure who the
55:39 - team administrator is or what their
55:41 - contact information is so has anybody
55:44 - been able to get in if so how
56:19 - okay his Hannah says all that is a bit
56:22 - unintuitive can you just use categories
56:24 - instead I'm not sure I'm trying to look
56:30 - at the timestamp for that was that in
56:34 - regard to to this bar here
56:54 - you know Evo says I don't really like
56:56 - that people are now using slack as a new
56:58 - generation of email maybe I'm just
57:00 - stubborn or getting old
57:02 - he says I'm twenty but I just can't
57:05 - really get used to it so I'm not sure
57:10 - that that 20 is old I guess if you're a
57:14 - kid 20 years old but yeah i'm i like
57:21 - slack but I'm not sure that slack is a
57:24 - actual email alternative I use slack for
57:27 - different things that I would never
57:29 - normally send an email for so I know
57:32 - there are people saying like slacks
57:34 - gonna kill email like emails that I
57:36 - don't buy that I emails probably gonna
57:38 - be around for a long time because
57:39 - everybody's used to it it works but
57:43 - slack is really cool for what it does
57:45 - and so I like I like that if I want to
57:52 - send a quick message to somebody that
57:54 - would be a waste of time to send in an
57:55 - email slack is really great for that
58:13 - okay so I'm getting some feedback about
58:14 - that section maybe change it from black
58:18 - to the like the red color and then that
58:22 - may that may look better
58:36 - okay Zanna says maybe like just leave it
58:43 - leave it white but add like a border a
58:46 - thin border at the bottom and the top or
58:53 - even like John said to make it make it
58:58 - that red color
59:08 - okay I'll have to try that out
59:29 - oh okay I see what is n I see what
59:32 - you're trying to say here so then let me
59:36 - let me try to explain what I think
59:38 - you're saying you could let me know if I
59:39 - got it right here
59:40 - so instead of having the word all right
59:43 - here which doesn't really say much have
59:46 - it say like categories or something and
59:50 - that would that would make more sense I
59:52 - did originally have it saying choose a
59:54 - category but I got an error so basically
60:00 - I had to like add in manually that the
60:03 - the word selected into that into that
60:07 - element into that option and then react
60:10 - gave me a warning it wasn't really an
60:13 - error message gave me a warning saying
60:14 - not to do that I don't know why I
60:16 - shouldn't do that but I could definitely
60:19 - change that back so that category is the
60:24 - first thing actually that would make
60:28 - sense it would definitely work if I
60:31 - would just say choose a category is the
60:34 - first thing that people say it's not
60:38 - going to be disabled the problem right
60:39 - now is it's disabled and greyed out a
60:40 - little bit I'll just make it have the
60:42 - same value as all and then that way
60:46 - it'll show everything if someone happens
60:51 - to click on it again who cares it'll
60:54 - still show everything or they would just
60:55 - naturally click on all
61:09 - okay yeah I think I'll do that I think I
61:13 - might actually do that right now since
61:14 - it's such a small change it would be
61:16 - better just to do it I mean I have it
61:19 - open already so let me I do want to
61:23 - double check would I put my I lost my
61:31 - terminal I just wanted to check to see
61:33 - if I had anything that was not committed
61:36 - here it is okay so it's clean you know
61:44 - obviously I'm gonna start doing a lot of
61:46 - stuff directly on the dead branch and
61:48 - just kind of merging in all the
61:50 - different branches that I've been
61:51 - working on into dev like as they start
61:54 - to get closer to being done
61:58 - so I'll take out disabled and I'll put
62:04 - in a zero and then that should
62:10 - automatically make it the first option
62:18 - so I say that it didn't Auto refresh
62:21 - there we go so that works better you can
62:30 - click all here what you want to make
62:32 - sure this works if I click choose a
62:33 - category it still works us all okay so
62:36 - that look better
62:48 - okay Patrick says get some Patrick
62:51 - suggested saying all categories
62:53 - Johnson's and categories yeah I think
62:58 - any of that work I probably I'm just
63:00 - gonna keep this just so that I don't
63:03 - spend any more time on it
63:04 - but anyway yeah I'm glad that that you
63:08 - brought that up because okay Patrick
63:11 - likes what I ended up with I'm glad you
63:13 - brought that up because I it was
63:17 - something I had thought of earlier and I
63:20 - thought the same thing that it would be
63:21 - weird and then I just kind of gotten
63:22 - used to it and and just kind of forgot
63:24 - about it and I never like I never wrote
63:28 - it down usually make a little note in
63:30 - Trello when I think something like that
63:32 - but for some reason I didn't and so just
63:35 - kind of forgot so it's really good to
63:39 - have all these people looking at it you
63:41 - know all of you looking at it and you
63:43 - know just in general on a project it's
63:45 - great to have other people look at it
63:46 - because when you're building it you just
63:49 - get used to certain things and take for
63:50 - granted that people are gonna understand
63:52 - it so it's really like I mean doesn't
63:56 - really matter how good you are as a
63:57 - developer I think that's it's just like
63:59 - a natural thing is that you can't look
64:02 - at it with fresh eyes like the user
64:05 - would a new user because you've been
64:08 - looking at it for so long I mean maybe
64:10 - if you waited a year and then looked at
64:12 - it again and you've forgotten it you
64:14 - know that would be the only way but I
64:16 - mean who has time to wait that long okay
64:18 - so that looks a lot better now let me
64:21 - commit that I'd hate to commit make a
64:25 - commit for such a small change but the
64:27 - other changes we're going to be doing
64:28 - you're so unrelated that I'd rather just
64:31 - just do it so so we're gonna commit
64:37 - we're gonna get commit and then we're
64:40 - gonna use the flag am so this will add
64:43 - the file and make the message at the
64:45 - same time so we don't separate it into
64:47 - two steps and let's see
64:54 - this is gonna change default option
65:07 - resource category select okay that works
65:14 - probably what's gonna happen is I'm
65:16 - gonna change that
65:18 - at some point so if I end up using a
65:20 - select somewhere else in the site I'll
65:25 - probably make this option be like a prop
65:31 - that you could pass in the text for this
65:33 - option I think that's the only thing
65:38 - that would have to change everything
65:40 - else could stay the same and it would
65:44 - work
65:45 - possibly like some of the colors could
65:47 - end up being options that get passed in
65:51 - but that would really be it then then it
65:54 - would make this component like fully
65:55 - reusable and as possible am I using
66:09 - okay so I'm not really using any colors
66:11 - here so this could stay and that would
66:13 - oh yeah I am I'm using this color so
66:20 - potentially I could just pull this and
66:23 - include it here so that the color could
66:27 - actually be a prop as well so I'm not
66:31 - gonna do it now but if I do end up using
66:34 - this again I'll pull that in and then it
66:39 - will be reusable all right so we need to
66:46 - bring up the about page cuz that's what
66:51 - we're gonna be working on and let me go
66:59 - back I wanna check the last shot just
67:00 - really quick
67:10 - let's see I'm bare toasters I wish I
67:12 - could open source this HR portal page so
67:15 - is that I'll bear - are you is that what
67:17 - you're working on now and you not
67:19 - allowed to open source it that's things
67:21 - I I I definitely prefer at least now
67:25 - definitely now that I'm doing streaming
67:27 - I prefer to work on things that can be
67:30 - open source
67:37 - Patrick is bringing up the new stuff and
67:42 - NPM five point two point zero is NTX
67:46 - it's a new command that's really useful
67:53 - so you could do like npx create react
67:56 - app new app it'll grab the latest create
68:00 - react app without polluting the global
68:03 - node that's cool yeah I saw some stuff
68:05 - on Twitter about it but I didn't really
68:07 - read into it anymore so people on
68:12 - Twitter seem to think it was really
68:13 - really useful so I have to check that
68:15 - out
68:17 - hey Sebastian's here how's it going
68:21 - yeah Sebastian pretty much all you
68:23 - missed I kind of explained how I fixed
68:27 - the select input from yesterday and I
68:31 - made a custom post type with a custom
68:33 - field in WordPress so we haven't really
68:38 - done too much with react yet and we're
68:40 - about to jump into that right now
68:50 - okay so in Patrick just put a link in to
68:58 - a medium article about npx so if you can
69:02 - get to the live chat and check out the
69:05 - the link then that should tell you a bit
69:11 - more about it
69:12 - I'm not even gonna attempt to read out
69:14 - the link because it's super long all
69:17 - right so we're on the about page the
69:19 - first thing let's just look at it and
69:21 - figure out where we're gonna put this
69:22 - thing so here's our about page now so
69:37 - let's see
69:46 - all right so this will definitely can
69:49 - stay down at the bottom this is the
69:51 - least important section I'm not sure I'm
70:01 - thinking probably we could probably put
70:08 - a new section here and that would make
70:11 - sense just visually it would break up
70:13 - this kind of double whitespace section
70:16 - since most you know we're breaking it up
70:19 - everywhere else so probably another red
70:23 - section something you make maybe another
70:28 - another red section in between here I'll
70:38 - probably give it a title just as more
70:40 - information for now and then if if it
70:45 - needs to change then it can change it's
70:47 - not really a big deal
70:48 - so that section will say more
70:50 - information and then it can have its I
70:57 - mean it's really just gonna have lists
70:59 - of links
71:06 - I don't think there's that many links
71:08 - right now I think it's like at most six
71:10 - or seven but it could potentially be
71:17 - more so would like to think of a way
71:21 - that it won't get too cluttered up if
71:23 - there's more
71:41 - I'll think about it let's just start to
71:43 - throw in some code now and then see how
71:46 - it looks and then think about right now
71:48 - I'm thinking maybe just like two columns
71:50 - of links and there they're gonna be Auto
71:53 - populated from an API call so I'll just
71:59 - have to figure out some way to
72:01 - distribute them between the two rows
72:03 - evenly and then hopefully the list I
72:10 - mean if the list ends up being like a
72:11 - hundred links it's going to be a super
72:13 - long section I'm okay with that I guess
72:15 - because I said I think the collaborator
72:17 - section is probably not really that
72:19 - helpful to users so not really not
72:27 - really a big deal all right so let's go
72:32 - back and unfortunately this is super
72:36 - long because I haven't transferred any
72:38 - of this stuff over to being pulled from
72:39 - the WordPress API so it's it's all just
72:42 - hard-coded in here but what I want to do
72:46 - is grab the red section that we're
72:50 - already using and I'll just copy and
72:55 - paste that down here and then that way
72:58 - we don't have to waste time typing in
73:01 - code that we've already typed in so this
73:04 - is a collaborator section that's the
73:07 - start of it so we want to pop this in
73:09 - right here and so we actually we need to
73:15 - put in
73:19 - this new section here
73:27 - let's see where if you like container
73:34 - put in another row here and we'll call
73:39 - this I don't remember what I originally
73:46 - was going to call this I'm just going to
73:47 - put information there for now we don't
73:50 - want this flourish white because
73:54 - actually I never ended up building yeah
73:57 - I think I don't think this is doing
74:01 - anything right now this was supposed to
74:03 - do something a long time ago and I guess
74:05 - I never removed it that was one of the
74:07 - things that just got pushed to the side
74:09 - as not really necessary to get done
74:12 - before we launched
74:14 - okay so we'll have that and we're gonna
74:19 - want two columns let's get rid of all
74:24 - this we don't need it and s12 is fine
74:29 - but we want to make this m6 and that'll
74:34 - give us our two columns and inside here
74:39 - you have EUL and then Ally
74:49 - and we're gonna have an a Atrus
75:15 - okay I just want to fill this in a bit
75:18 - to give us an idea of what were what
75:23 - it's gonna look like
75:32 - okay so let's see
75:40 - okay not great just look great right now
75:46 - let's see so obviously we want to change
75:54 - it I'll probably make these I think
75:58 - it'll look a lot better if they're both
75:59 - centerline obviously the the color is
76:05 - gonna change to be white you probably do
76:16 - with making the the font size for the
76:19 - links a bit bigger and maybe like some
76:27 - more space between the list items since
76:32 - they're gonna be things that people are
76:33 - going to want to click on I want to make
76:35 - sure there's enough space especially so
76:37 - on mobile people don't accidentally
76:40 - click you know users with big thumbs
76:43 - have trouble hitting target so I think
76:48 - you usually want to have at least 48 -
76:51 - yes so that's only 20 pixels tall the
76:55 - click target for that's only 20 pixels
76:56 - so the Li itself is even only 25 pixels
77:01 - tall so we definitely want to make this
77:03 - bigger increasing the font size will
77:05 - help to but then maybe we'll increase
77:07 - the line height so I want to at least
77:11 - hit like 40 pixels and that should be
77:15 - decent for for people even with with
77:21 - larger thumbs okay
77:24 - so hook like you remember all that so
77:27 - new color
77:28 - Center it increase the font size and
77:31 - then we'll check it out
77:41 - let's see
77:56 - I think I'm just going to give this a
78:00 - class this section of class of PDF links
78:12 - all right and now that we have that PDF
78:16 - links then we can target this down in
78:18 - our style JSX section here
78:39 - and let's go with make I want to make
78:51 - sure I override anything that
78:52 - materializes doing so otherwise I guess
78:55 - I wouldn't normally need to be that
78:56 - specific but I don't want to mess around
78:59 - that should be specific enough there
79:01 - that'll work so we want to deal it a
79:03 - color of white and let's do a font size
79:10 - of let's try 22 and see how that looks
79:20 - we also want we want to Center it so we
79:30 - want to Center that within the columns
79:33 - actually we don't I'm not gonna put that
79:36 - down here because we already have a
79:37 - class for that I think this will work
79:45 - if we do if I put on this row this might
79:51 - work
79:56 - to the line Center
80:05 - it's just Center I think it is so I'm
80:07 - trying to remember with the materialized
80:09 - classes for this I think it's just
80:10 - Center so let's see what that did
80:13 - alright cool what did everything so here
80:15 - we have it here's all our links we did
80:19 - get a little bit bigger here but I think
80:21 - it's still not big enough for a target
80:23 - yeah so it's the only 25 pixels so I
80:27 - don't know that I want to go any bigger
80:29 - with the font size so maybe we'll just
80:32 - add some padding to these links and then
80:36 - maybe a little Morgan we'll see so down
80:44 - here let's give it some padding and
80:49 - let's get let's give it a pixel all
80:52 - around and then between these allies
81:03 - let's give normally I would flip the
81:06 - order of this I don't know that it
81:08 - bothers me but I guess it'll be okay for
81:10 - now let's give it a margin of
81:16 - [Music]
81:21 - let's see
81:25 - let's go I don't want a huge margin so
81:28 - let's go four pixels and then zero on
81:30 - the sides there so this when you only
81:33 - have to the first number it first unit
81:37 - is the top and bottom margin and the
81:39 - second one is the left and right margin
81:44 - don't know what did I do
81:47 - I messed something up let me just try to
81:51 - give it a refresh maybe that's all yeah
81:53 - there we go
81:55 - remember that when something weird
81:57 - happens just refresh before you panic
82:02 - alright so now we have a area that we
82:11 - can click on of what is it like 40 what
82:18 - was that 40 it's actually 41 over a
82:27 - little bit it's actually not exactly how
82:32 - I wanted it so let's mess around in dev
82:35 - tools here for a little bit and see two
82:42 - one so I increase this a bit and we'll
82:48 - see so this is our a tag and these are L
82:51 - eyes and what was happening let me try
82:55 - to exaggerate this so we can really see
82:57 - what's going on so let's make this
83:01 - spacing bigger okay that's actually a
83:08 - bit better there's like some overlap
83:14 - where the click target will seem like it
83:16 - was down here in the spot so that's too
83:18 - much spacing but I might go with like 8
83:21 - pixels
83:34 - let's see weekend I don't know if you
83:36 - can tell that I'll try to zoom in so
83:40 - that what's happening is the click area
83:45 - is kind of bleeding over into the area
83:49 - of the margin so I might get rid of the
83:52 - margins on the lis and just put it
83:55 - directly on the a tags and see how that
83:57 - is because otherwise I don't want there
84:02 - to be I'd rather have there be a slight
84:05 - gap of the the clink targets so let's
84:14 - just pull this and for now just get rid
84:24 - of that
84:30 - okay so I want to see how it's working
84:42 - hmm
84:46 - and that's what I thought would happen
84:49 - there we go so initially what had
84:53 - happened is it wasn't working because of
84:56 - the way it was displayed now it's
84:59 - definitely working
85:08 - I switched to display:block but now
85:15 - that's too much so might not even need a
85:19 - margin Oh actually no I definitely don't
85:26 - want it to display:block because then
85:27 - it's gonna go across so let's take that
85:29 - out and
85:33 - [Music]
85:41 - now that's not gonna change it alright
85:44 - I'm not gonna mess with this anymore it
85:47 - works I just like oh maybe I'll actually
85:50 - test it on a phone just to see maybe I'm
85:53 - worrying over nothing and it would be
85:56 - fine to click I think this is too much
85:59 - space between the lists and the heading
86:02 - here so I'm gonna remove some of that
86:04 - space other than that it looks weird
86:07 - because these titles are really small
86:09 - but the titles are definitely gonna be
86:11 - bigger everything on this project has
86:13 - huge titles so I'm more worried about
86:17 - having not enough space for the titles
86:19 - and then wrapping onto another line okay
86:25 - so we'll just leave this kind of as is
86:28 - and then get rid of this space and then
86:30 - we'll be done with that for now
86:32 - and we'll we'll work on the page and
86:37 - then obviously we're gonna want to pull
86:39 - this in this date in through the API for
86:42 - now lo I want to just get all the pieces
86:46 - working before adding that extra
86:48 - complexity of pulling in the data okay
86:57 - so let me remove remove this margin for
87:01 - now we'll just keep the padding let's
87:09 - actually let me I want to see what's
87:11 - causing this space
87:18 - so it looks like we do have a margarine
87:22 - on the bottom of that div but we also
87:24 - have a margin on the H tag
87:31 - I'll try getting rid of the well we have
87:40 - a margin on the UL so we have quite a
87:43 - few margins going on here if I get rid
87:46 - of the margin on the h2 and on the div
87:49 - that should be enough I'd rather do that
87:52 - then come to mess with the UL
88:10 - all right so I'm going to do some inline
88:13 - Styles now and in react you can you do
88:17 - inline styles as JavaScript objects so
88:19 - the first bracket your in JavaScript and
88:22 - then the second bracket may put you in
88:24 - an object so we're gonna go
88:28 - margin-bottom we're gonna camelcase it
88:30 - and we're gonna say zero and then I'm
88:37 - just gonna copy that and paste it on
88:41 - this h2 as well and let's see and that
88:50 - did not any refresh okay let me restart
88:57 - my server and since I'm restarting it
89:02 - this would be a good time to check in
89:04 - with the live chat
89:23 - okay so John has says how about instead
89:32 - of a new section to break up the white
89:34 - space you just had a thin red bar above
89:36 - collaborators on the about page
89:40 - minimalistic and the page content seems
89:42 - filled up enough okay I mean I I
89:46 - obviously didn't see that before I
89:49 - already did this so I'm gonna keep I
89:55 - probably keep this section the same
89:56 - because I already just made it but I
89:59 - actually kind of liked that idea I'm
90:01 - gonna keep that in mind
90:02 - for if I need to add other sections
90:07 - because I don't like being tied into
90:09 - like always having to break things up in
90:12 - the same way John so we have two John's
90:20 - so the first round I just talked to is
90:22 - John be the next one this is John John
90:24 - Hanson says the API data I'm guessing
90:29 - JSON yes it's JSON is this type of file
90:32 - difficult to gzip from the server the
90:34 - project I built went live but all
90:36 - testing shows JSON only file type not
90:39 - compressed done hmm I don't actually
90:43 - don't have experience with that
90:46 - can you can you gzip JSON files from the
90:51 - server I don't I don't know does anybody
90:54 - have any experience with that
91:03 - all right Zanna thanks for answering the
91:05 - the question about the editor
91:18 - Patrick said Patrick said that says yes
91:23 - he likes this question when it gets this
91:26 - question we are getting dangerously far
91:27 - and we were getting dangerously far into
91:29 - the stream without someone asking which
91:31 - would break the streak of every stream
91:33 - so thanks yes thanks for asking that I
91:37 - honestly don't know if it's been asked
91:39 - every stream I'd have to go back and
91:41 - watch them which I probably won't do
91:43 - because as is the case I think with most
91:46 - people but the sound of my own voice
91:48 - just sounds really weird so I usually
91:50 - don't watch my streams often
91:52 - occasionally I'll watch just to see if I
91:54 - can like improve things sometimes I
91:59 - watch to see if I'm saying filler words
92:01 - a lot like um and things which I do and
92:05 - I try to work on huh but it's been a
92:10 - streak of enough episodes that I think
92:12 - we have an official streak going so
92:14 - we'll just we'll just try to keep it
92:17 - going well we are an hour in already
92:20 - crazy actually even more than an hour
92:25 - and when did I start I started it too
92:27 - huh okay
92:37 - John Henson says is it not 44 pixel
92:42 - height and the width minimum for four
92:44 - button links are the reason for using
92:47 - pixels over em2 your website I'm not
92:51 - really sure why you would want to use
92:53 - eeehm or pixels I'm just used to pixels
92:56 - so I can guess I can usually visualize
92:59 - how many pixels the thing will be on the
93:01 - screen because I'm used to pixels I'm
93:04 - not good at visualizing at all what
93:06 - eeehm would be so that's why I use
93:08 - pixels
93:09 - the only other unit I ever use are vh +
93:13 - VW that's also easy to visualize because
93:17 - it's just a percentage of the screen but
93:21 - I'm sure it's probably whatever you used
93:23 - to would be what you end up using unless
93:27 - there's some other other reason why you
93:30 - would want to use a different unit on
93:39 - jar says using REM or e/m is a good
93:43 - practice so yeah I just I see a lot of
93:48 - people using it I'm just not sure why
93:50 - what the benefit is to using it so if
93:53 - anybody knows I'd be open to to hearing
93:58 - about the benefit to using that I don't
94:01 - really know that I would switch at this
94:04 - point since I'm so used to using text
94:06 - the benefit would have to be really big
94:08 - for me to try to switch right now since
94:10 - I'm I've gotten really good at just
94:14 - being able to visualize things in in
94:17 - pixels so I would need a really good
94:21 - reason to switch from it
94:27 - Oh someone's name in the lab chat is
94:29 - inside the matrix that's awesome a great
94:32 - name I used to be a huge matrix fan like
94:36 - back you know when the first matrix came
94:39 - out
94:50 - oh no way all right so bill says there's
94:58 - an app called like so that you can start
95:02 - when you do a stream that will help
95:03 - analyze use of filler words I'm gonna
95:08 - have to look that up because I listened
95:11 - really early on in one of my first
95:13 - streams I listened through the whole
95:15 - thing and I couldn't stand it
95:18 - I used the word um so often it drove me
95:21 - nuts and then on the next stream I
95:23 - apologized profusely to everyone for
95:26 - making them sit through all of that so I
95:29 - really made an effort afterwards to stop
95:31 - that but I think I'm slipping back into
95:33 - it especially on days like this where
95:35 - I'm pretty tired and I'm mostly focusing
95:37 - on on the code so once I get started and
95:42 - I'm talking about something it's usually
95:45 - better but what I'm trying to code and
95:47 - talk at the same time or read things off
95:49 - of the live chat I do say I'm a lot I
95:52 - guess that's normal but I'd still like
95:57 - to quit doing it if I could
96:02 - jonbi says I was so upset they didn't
96:05 - name the sequel's the matrices so this
96:08 - equals to the matrix I like that one
96:15 - Jeremy says I don't even know this
96:17 - filler words my dude so cool yeah I
96:20 - actually read a study where they said
96:22 - that so some people tried to stop using
96:25 - filler words by talking more slowly and
96:27 - pausing instead of using filler words
96:29 - but they did a study where people were
96:32 - more I wanna say how did it go basically
96:36 - people had a much more negative view of
96:39 - speakers who took long pauses then of
96:41 - speakers who use filler words so if it's
96:43 - a choice between pausing and filler
96:45 - words you're better off using filler
96:47 - words so I guess I guess it could be
96:52 - worse than using filler words
97:00 - all right so let me get back to this so
97:05 - this is for now good enough so that we
97:09 - can click on it and make sure it goes to
97:12 - the right place which is all I really am
97:15 - going for for now so now the next step
97:18 - is going to be let me commit this first
97:23 - and where we got
97:40 - okay
97:42 - it's weird out this keeps doing it every
97:44 - time the hot module reloading happens it
97:46 - doesn't load all the styles that's so
97:49 - weird
97:54 - alright so now let's go back to the code
97:58 - we're gonna have to make a new page and
98:00 - next J s and I want to use one of these
98:03 - pages as a head start so I think these
98:12 - pages are pretty much the same single
98:23 - event single news the news page is
98:30 - probably what I want
98:37 - yeah this page has some extra stuff that
98:40 - I don't want to have to change that so
98:42 - the news page I think is more basic
98:54 - am i pulling in I am pulling in some
98:59 - stuff that I didn't add like the SEO
99:03 - description
99:12 - I don't even think I'm ended up making
99:16 - that text I think we're fine I'll copy
99:19 - this page and we use that to make our
99:25 - new page here so I'm gonna call this PDF
99:39 - page don't yes
99:42 - no actually okay it shouldn't matter
99:51 - what the name of the pages now that I
99:53 - think about it
100:03 - and maybe it will
100:07 - I gotta check out my server file for a
100:10 - second hold on okay so
100:36 - what I want to check is with this goes
100:39 - down so let me check out our events page
100:42 - real quick I just wanted I'm worried
100:45 - about what's gonna show up in the URL so
100:50 - I can't remember how it shows up okay so
100:54 - this does show up is events okay
101:08 - okay I see where I put it so I so I can
101:14 - put whatever I want right there so it
101:15 - doesn't even really matter what's here
101:27 - okay that works let me was I know it's
101:35 - right here
101:37 - PDF I guess I'll hyphenated since I was
101:40 - already hyphenating stuff but now that I
101:42 - think about it it doesn't I don't know
101:44 - that it makes much sense probably should
101:46 - have been camel casing this I think the
101:49 - only reason I hyphenated it was because
101:51 - I'm in the pages folder and normally
101:54 - whatever the titles here and the pages
101:56 - end up being URLs and in URLs you're
102:01 - more likely to see hyphens and not
102:03 - obviously not camel case so PDF pages I
102:09 - should say PDF page give me a single
102:11 - page to PDF page such as okay so now we
102:19 - have our PDF page and I can paste in all
102:23 - of this stuff and let me make sure that
102:33 - I really need this
102:41 - so I don't want posts what I want are
102:45 - PDF what was that PDF page we brought
102:52 - this over didn't we I think I'm maybe I
102:59 - must have moved it over again
103:20 - I couldn't remember I think it's just
103:23 - PDF page is what we put in a the API
103:30 - call so we're gonna filter
103:44 - by our ID which is actually gonna end up
103:48 - being the slug
103:59 - we're not gonna need so this is where I
104:02 - filter out what we actually need
104:03 - I don't need taxonomy x' I need content
104:09 - I don't need the excerpt I'm gonna keep
104:13 - it the ID you know actually I don't know
104:17 - if that I even need the ID I don't need
104:19 - tags or categories we're not gonna have
104:21 - an image any featured media all right so
104:27 - that's all we need this will cut out a
104:29 - lot of the other stuff now I need to
104:34 - make sure that I get rid of those things
104:36 - down here if I was using them so this
104:41 - works we don't want let's see what the
104:57 - information this description tag
105:02 - obviously we're not getting anything
105:04 - from the description tag because we're
105:09 - not pulling that in so I guess I can
105:14 - take it out for now just make things
105:18 - more simple I might put it in later on
105:20 - and I'm gonna pass in
105:39 - you don't need that
105:44 - now we got our error page if we need it
105:50 - that are sticking of we're gonna we're
105:53 - not gonna have an image for now we're
105:58 - not gonna have an image but we might add
106:04 - an image to just have the same image for
106:06 - all the info pages for now I think it'll
106:09 - be fine we'll just put in just kind of
106:14 - like a normal title so let's just do an
106:17 - h1 and do there's something we'll have
106:25 - to set it as will need to use
106:29 - dangerously set enter HTML because it's
106:36 - it's possible that
106:48 - sorry I just stuffed in the middle of
106:51 - the thought so basically it's possible
106:54 - that there could be characters that
106:56 - wouldn't show up properly if we just put
107:01 - this props title rendered inside the tag
107:04 - so that's why we do dangerous asset
107:06 - enter HTML because sometimes there's
107:08 - special characters that don't render
107:09 - properly or if I can just close this
107:16 - we'll try it out we'll see how that
107:22 - looks I might have to put that in its
107:23 - own row to make it show up better but it
107:28 - should work there and drops a 2-0 I
107:34 - guess has to put 0 in here okay we're
107:39 - getting the data I should probably use
107:46 - destructuring to get rid of all this but
107:49 - I'm not I'm not worried about it right
107:50 - now there's not really a lot going on
108:02 - okay that's good for now this will give
108:03 - us enough to see obviously we're gonna
108:05 - have to do something with the URL and
108:08 - have some sort of button to download the
108:12 - PDF but for now this will be enough to
108:15 - be able to see what's going on so now we
108:19 - need to go to the server da JS file and
108:30 - I'm just gonna copy and paste what's
108:32 - already being used here for single news
108:37 - and we'll change it out and say we just
108:44 - call that info I think it should be fine
108:46 - I don't it's easy to change later on if
108:51 - I need to as long as I don't think of
108:55 - too many people of link to it actually
109:02 - I'm a bit worried that they might think
109:04 - info is too informal
109:07 - it's kind of kind of a pretty formal
109:10 - type of thing type of organisation that
109:14 - this site's being made for I don't want
109:18 - to put information because they just
109:19 - make it unnecessarily long so how about
109:21 - I just put I that'll be fun I mean
109:26 - YouTube just has a C and their custom
109:30 - URLs for channels so I think that's fine
109:33 - I could put a P for PDF but like I said
109:39 - up I don't want it to be thought that
109:41 - this page is you know just a transition
109:46 - of a PDF I want the PDF to be thought of
109:48 - as the secondary thing
109:54 - the original plan well that I was told
109:58 - is that it was just going to be a bunch
110:00 - of links to PDFs but that's not really a
110:02 - good thing to do on the web it's it's
110:06 - hard you can't search through that
110:07 - content search engines can't see it at
110:10 - least all the content within so so I
110:14 - argued passionately against that idea
110:16 - and so this is this is what was agreed
110:20 - upon so we need to make this our PDF
110:28 - page per mg okay so this is gonna pass
110:40 - the name so we just need to make sure
110:43 - when we make our links the name the slug
110:50 - for that post is what comes after this
110:57 - in the well after this in the URL so
111:01 - this ID part needs to be the slug when
111:04 - we format our URLs for the about page
111:08 - and then everything should work so I'm
111:11 - gonna save that and I'm gonna make sure
111:15 - that I say this as well since we changed
111:19 - the server I need to restart it and I
111:27 - just need to make sure of the the slug
111:31 - so I don't know where I put my I'm just
111:35 - gonna go over to my wordpress
111:41 - installation here oh here we go I
111:45 - finally found my data here's the data I
111:47 - was looking for before so I just need
111:49 - the slug as his test page and I don't
111:54 - know that I was pulling in the slug no I
111:57 - wasn't I need to make sure well I don't
112:03 - need to pull it in here
112:04 - nevermind I don't know what I was
112:05 - thinking so what I need to do is use
112:11 - test page as our URL that's it so I
112:15 - should be able to go in here now and
112:20 - type in I slash test page
112:30 - and that that happened but what is going
112:33 - on okay I see when I copy this page this
112:39 - news page
112:40 - I hadn't copied over shoot what was it
112:49 - I need the side nav actually that's
112:53 - really weird it shouldn't be like that
112:59 - but it's a within nav that should be
113:04 - taking care of that it should should
113:06 - take care of the global and its side
113:08 - enough so I just want to make sure
113:13 - servers fine that's working fine the PDF
113:16 - page I'm 14
113:27 - looks like I'm I'm not bringing in
113:29 - enough okay so I'm bringing in layout
113:34 - within layout nav should be brought in
113:43 - it's that that's odd am I trying to hit
113:49 - the side now somewhere else no this is
113:52 - low phase you
114:12 - all right so I shouldn't have to do this
114:14 - but I think I'm just gonna do it to see
114:19 - if this gets rid of the problem
114:30 - I mean maybe there's something that's
114:31 - going on because it's a parameterised
114:33 - route that I don't know who knows but if
114:37 - this fixes it and that's all I have to
114:39 - do then I'm happy about that you know it
114:41 - didn't
114:58 - all right so
115:09 - that's really odd
115:16 - so I want to check out and see if this
115:23 - is working I know I want to compare I
115:28 - want to compare this to our our file
115:43 - for single events right because the
115:47 - single events used to be the same as the
115:50 - single news and this actually is working
115:54 - so let's see what's different between
115:57 - these ones I'm gonna get rid of that
116:00 - that I added to the top components okay
116:11 - this is interesting so in the single
116:13 - event I'm not using the layout component
116:30 - so that I mean that's a really big
116:32 - difference Wow for the single event this
116:39 - is this is kind of the old way before he
116:43 - switched over to doing things like this
116:51 - I'd hate to switch back to this just to
116:54 - make it work but if I can't figure out
116:58 - what's going on then maybe I'll have to
117:06 - I'm gonna check the live chat just to
117:10 - see so basically everything is pretty
117:14 - much working like we wanted to we're
117:16 - getting it kind of an error unrelated to
117:20 - what the goal was having to do with the
117:25 - init function for the side nav okay so
117:30 - but at least at this point we've
117:33 - successfully had you know you can see
117:36 - the flash quickly of the content well
117:40 - let me let me restart this dev server so
117:44 - we can see it so you can quickly see the
117:47 - flash of content that comes up and it is
117:51 - the content for the page it says test
117:54 - page it has our lorem ipsum so that's
117:57 - working so I guess it's it's mission
118:01 - accomplished kind of for what we wanted
118:06 - to do now I just need to figure this out
118:08 - so I'm gonna go back in the live chat
118:10 - and see if you all have given me any
118:13 - ideas about the problem or if there's
118:15 - any questions that I can answer now
118:17 - since this is now already two hours in
118:22 - it might be a good time to just you know
118:25 - answer some questions and and finish up
118:27 - since since I've accomplished what I
118:30 - wanted to for this dream and then I'll
118:35 - just fix this before I leave today or
118:39 - tomorrow morning
118:59 - okay so we were having a discussion
119:02 - about fonts the units for fonts of
119:05 - pixels versus a.m. and Zanna says the
119:16 - idea is you you ever want to change your
119:19 - font size you just changed it once and
119:21 - all EMS will just use it how does
119:26 - anybody do you say EMS or do you say Ms
119:30 - I'm not really sure I've ever heard it
119:32 - pronounced so I don't know let me know
119:45 - okay so basically the pixels are won't
119:50 - won't respond so it's just much easier
119:55 - to scale your fonts up or down okay
120:14 - okay cool thanks Zanna sent me a link
120:18 - from CSS tricks so thanks thanks for
120:22 - sending that as more information about
120:25 - the whole font units discussion so
120:31 - anyway that's cool I mean that's pretty
120:33 - legit reason for using it so like I said
120:36 - before not sure that I'll switch right
120:39 - away
120:39 - it might be more of a gradual thing but
120:46 - that's pretty decent decent reason I'll
120:49 - just have to get an idea of like what
120:52 - what pixel size compares to the near the
120:59 - rem-3 M's
121:22 - okay Umberto says at least from what I
121:25 - understand and the the the REM unit is
121:30 - compound the compounded scale of the
121:33 - font so if you have REM styles nested it
121:37 - will keep scaling to the most recently
121:39 - scaled size then Zanna says so pixels at
121:47 - the root REM for components and then EMS
121:52 - for text okay I'll definitely have to
121:56 - learn some more and give this some more
121:58 - thought before I start implementing it
122:00 - but it definitely seems like there's
122:02 - some advantages to it
122:10 - okay Alberto says the dev tips youtube
122:13 - channel has a good explanation so
122:15 - actually I off to watch that I really
122:18 - like the dev stiffs channel so if anyone
122:21 - wants some a good resource for learning
122:24 - like CSS and some more design related
122:27 - stuff check out the dev tips channel I
122:31 - the the guy who does that
122:34 - he doesn't do many videos anymore he got
122:36 - a job at Google and is just really busy
122:39 - so I haven't seen very many videos from
122:42 - him lately but his old videos are still
122:45 - really good and pretty relevant it's not
122:47 - like CSS changes that often and a lot of
122:49 - what he does is mostly CSS so I think
122:53 - they're still useful and he's pretty
122:57 - entertaining too easy to listen to
123:03 - Travis that's his name I'm pretty sure
123:05 - the guy from dev tips is his name is
123:06 - Travis okay Santa says there's this
123:12 - whole debate over the pixels okay so so
123:15 - maybe I've stepped in here into some
123:18 - some turbulent waters here with with
123:21 - this debate so I'll have to I definitely
123:25 - won't have time to study up on this
123:27 - right now because I gotta get this site
123:28 - it done but that'll be on the list I may
123:34 - have time to watch the
123:35 - tips video though because I could do
123:37 - that while I'm doing other things
123:39 - multitask a bit alright we had another
123:46 - question about the code editor Thank You
123:48 - Zanna for answering the question again
124:00 - John Hanson says innerhtml found found
124:03 - that out the hard way there's the
124:05 - special characters yeah so that was back
124:08 - when we were I was referencing using
124:10 - dangerously set innerhtml for stuff so
124:16 - like for the title and for the content
124:19 - here so it sounds like you shouldn't use
124:23 - it and I think I'm pretty sure at some
124:29 - point on a stream or something I had
124:31 - someone who was like a little bit upset
124:35 - that I was using this but my thinking is
124:41 - well number one like what else are you
124:43 - gonna do like this this comes through
124:45 - and there's special characters in it it
124:48 - gives you like the character codes and
124:49 - study actual characters and it's it's
124:51 - unreadable you can't you can't have that
124:55 - also as long as you control what data is
124:58 - coming in here which which I do then
125:01 - there's no reason not to use that you
125:05 - wouldn't just pull in random data from
125:07 - somewhere like you'd never want to pull
125:09 - in data that a user could enter you know
125:15 - just some random user could enter
125:16 - because maybe it would be you could do
125:20 - some malicious type of stuff with
125:22 - JavaScript but in this case you know
125:26 - this is the proper way to do it it just
125:27 - happens to be named this crazy name
125:30 - dangerously set in HTML just to warn
125:33 - people but if you know what you're doing
125:35 - then there's no reason not to use it
125:46 - Philip Philip B don't worry about asking
125:49 - the question about the editor that's
125:50 - it's like I totally don't mind when
125:54 - people ask about the editor it's just
125:56 - kind of like a running joke here because
125:58 - everybody asks about the editor so I've
126:01 - gotten so many questions about it that
126:04 - we started joking that we need to have
126:06 - like a chatbot and this job would would
126:09 - be just to say what what the editor is
126:11 - and like made with theme and plugins and
126:13 - stuff amusing so but don't don't feel
126:16 - bad at all I know I used to think the
126:20 - same when I was kind of beginning and
126:22 - starting out that was what I wanted to
126:24 - know all the time when I saw somebody's
126:26 - YouTube video I was always too kind of
126:29 - too embarrassed and shy to ask in a
126:32 - youtube comment so I always was like
126:34 - searching through the comments hoping to
126:36 - somebody else ask the question and then
126:37 - I'd be able to find out what the editor
126:40 - is so I totally understand the desire to
126:46 - know what's going on with with other
126:48 - people's code editors okay and then
126:54 - someone whose name starts with F and
126:57 - then there's a lot of numbers
126:59 - anyone want to explain exactly what he
127:01 - was working on so I'll try to give a
127:06 - really really fast summary of what I've
127:08 - been doing but I've been streaming for
127:10 - over two hours now so it's gonna be
127:11 - tough to sum it all up but basically I
127:15 - made a custom post type in WordPress
127:17 - with a custom field and then I exposed
127:20 - that data by the WordPress API I then
127:24 - pulled that data into a react website
127:27 - that was also using next jazz I use some
127:32 - custom routing in addition to the
127:34 - routing that's there by default for next
127:36 - G is to do what's called parameterised
127:40 - routing so that I can populate a like a
127:43 - template react jazz template based on
127:46 - the post slug in WordPress and do an API
127:49 - call to get the data from just that slug
127:55 - that way it doesn't matter you
127:59 - how many pieces of data are in there
128:01 - there will always be another page there
128:03 - will always have a nice-looking URL
128:05 - based on the the slug for that
128:08 - particular post so thanks that actually
128:12 - wasn't bad I thought it would take me
128:14 - longer to explain it so I'm not sure how
128:17 - how much since that made just such a
128:20 - quick explanation but that's basically
128:23 - what was done along the way we talked
128:26 - about some other things too but in terms
128:29 - of code that's what we did
128:41 - actually I didn't notice it Philip so
128:44 - Phil you just started coding yesterday
128:46 - so awesome welcome to coding and I'm not
128:51 - sure Philips in I didn't see Philip say
128:55 - say anything else so I hope I hope you
128:59 - didn't leave Philip but if you're still
129:01 - here
129:02 - welcome to coding and that's really cool
129:06 - that you're getting involved so right
129:10 - now we're at a point in the stream where
129:12 - we were kind of at an advanced level but
129:17 - every time I start a new project I'll
129:19 - start out with some basics so there's
129:21 - always going to be some basic things
129:23 - that even someone who's very new could
129:25 - probably benefit from so you know check
129:30 - out some of the videos like the titles
129:32 - of some previous live streams and you
129:35 - know if the title is something that
129:37 - interests you you know check it out
129:38 - there's definitely some beginner level
129:41 - stuff in there and I definitely don't be
129:44 - afraid to ask any questions and the live
129:46 - chat or in the comments of the videos
129:48 - you can even direct message me on
129:50 - Twitter I'd be happy to you know give
129:52 - you some advice if you need it
130:10 - John Hanson said I like how we see
130:12 - Jessie struggle that's how it's done
130:14 - I'm glad you like Amy struggle is that's
130:18 - what a lot of the stream is me
130:20 - struggling is when I'm not on the stream
130:24 - I don't have nearly as many issues but
130:27 - believe it or not I usually get a lot
130:30 - done and don't run into so many problems
130:33 - for some reason especially lately the
130:36 - streams have been really difficult and
130:38 - I've just had these like errors and
130:41 - stuff pop up and things just not working
130:43 - out which is fine it probably makes the
130:45 - stream a bit more entertaining and more
130:47 - interactive because you are trying to
130:49 - help me fix it if I just flew through
130:51 - everything and got it all done really
130:53 - quickly it it I don't think that would
130:56 - be as good for the stream it might be
131:00 - better for my project but not not great
131:03 - for this drain okay so we get some
131:09 - commentary here on the pronunciation so
131:13 - okay so we have e m we have M Janice's
131:18 - M's Sara's heard it at M's hey Sarah I'm
131:25 - not sure that I've seen you in the chat
131:27 - before so welcome Sarah okay so maybe
131:34 - I'll say m's now it seems like the the
131:36 - MS one out in the live chat so the the
131:41 - CSS unit that spelled e/m I will
131:44 - pronounce M from now
131:57 - I'll evil s about the format that the
132:00 - content comes through with a dangerously
132:02 - set innerhtml property so if you have
132:05 - content coming in that has HTML tags and
132:08 - you don't want those HTML tags to be
132:10 - displayed you know literally on the
132:14 - screen then you use dangerously set
132:17 - enter HTML then the HTML gets evaluated
132:21 - like it should by the browser you know
132:23 - so all your tags will work properly so
132:29 - it'll it'll be viewed as actual HTML
132:32 - content instead of just a string
132:47 - it's said that made you say we should we
132:50 - should call it live coding with Jesse
132:52 - and the atom editor and then no more
132:53 - questions we just put some text in the
132:56 - corner Eva says she's pathetic yeah yeah
133:03 - I don't know I don't mind the question I
133:04 - think it's kind of fun I I really I
133:06 - don't think I want to put it anywhere
133:08 - that I'm using atom editor I think it
133:11 - would be more fun to just see how many
133:13 - times people ask the question I'm not
133:17 - annoyed by it yet so if I ever do get
133:21 - annoyed maybe then I can have something
133:24 - in on the screen I already have
133:26 - something in the description for the for
133:28 - the videos it's it's there somewhere if
133:31 - you just have to read the description
133:45 - and Amica so sorry if i'm pronouncing
133:49 - that wrong it's eme ka so let me know if
133:53 - I'm pronouncing it wrong so a Mika says
133:56 - hello hey not sure I'm not sure if I've
134:02 - seen you in the chat before so welcome
134:04 - if this is your first time chatting
134:13 - okay so Amica want to know if the code
134:16 - editor does some sort of live preview or
134:18 - any kind of preview so by default I
134:21 - don't think it it uses it does a preview
134:24 - there's probably some sort of plug-in
134:27 - they could do a preview so right now
134:30 - like I'm running a development server on
134:34 - my computer and it does it like reloads
134:36 - everything which you can't see it right
134:41 - now because I have this error message on
134:42 - the screen so it's not it's not coming
134:46 - from the editor but if you if you really
134:51 - wanted an editor that could give you a
134:53 - live preview just want to think of which
134:57 - one would do that well I know like there
135:01 - are some cloud editors that do that like
135:05 - cloud 9 is a cloud editor that does that
135:08 - should I think desktop I guess like
135:12 - Dreamweaver does that I don't know that
135:15 - I would recommend using Dreamweaver but
135:17 - there may be there's a lot of plugins
135:19 - I'm using Adam and there's a lot of
135:21 - plug-ins for it so maybe able to do that
135:38 - Sabo so SSD a bow or so SE must
135:45 - try to pronounce em I'm gonna say Sabo
135:47 - for now since you're still doing this I
135:49 - left the stream maybe two hours ago yeah
135:52 - I am still doing this
135:54 - sometimes the streams are quite long
136:03 - there's some surprise you just don't
136:05 - post the editor and plugins used to make
136:08 - the video about it in the info I did I
136:11 - do I have the editor I have a I'm pretty
136:15 - sure I have a link to the editor in the
136:16 - info I don't have the plugins the I
136:20 - showed all the plugins yesterday on the
136:24 - stream I keep intending to make a like a
136:27 - recorded video for my own youtube
136:29 - channel where I go through how I have
136:31 - Adams set up and I go through all the
136:34 - plugins and everything I just haven't
136:36 - had time to do it yet
136:46 - okay so the the person with lots of
136:50 - numbers in their name and the live chat
136:52 - asks can you summarize this project for
136:54 - me yeah I'll try to do click summary
136:57 - it's it's a react website that's built
137:02 - using next Jas which is kind of like a
137:04 - scaffolding tool for react that comes
137:06 - built in with routing and server-side
137:08 - rendering so it's a react site that's
137:11 - pulling data from a wordpress site the
137:14 - WordPress site has no like publicly
137:18 - visible face to it it's just being used
137:21 - as a content management system so that
137:23 - users who have no coding skills can put
137:27 - in the data easily and then that data
137:30 - comes into the react site it's displayed
137:33 - it looks nice it runs quickly that's
137:37 - pretty much it
137:38 - I mean there's not really it's pretty
137:40 - straightforward there's some other stuff
137:42 - involved like we're doing load balancing
137:44 - between two different node servers the
137:47 - WordPress installation is on a separate
137:49 - server so there's some some extra stuff
137:51 - that's going on that may be a bit beyond
137:54 - like just a really basic project but
137:56 - that's pretty much it
138:07 - yeah the stream will be available to
138:09 - watch so add a question if the stream is
138:11 - available so it will be available to
138:12 - watch usually within a few minutes after
138:15 - I end the stream you can watch the
138:17 - recording and I just saw that Patrick
138:22 - already answered that so thanks Patrick
138:25 - inside the matrix that says you should
138:28 - make a counter in the corner for how
138:30 - many times it's asked for people asking
138:32 - about the editor that would be really
138:34 - cool
138:52 - okay so so amicus question about editors
138:57 - that have a built-in preview thing so
139:00 - Sabo says brackets has a built-in
139:04 - preview that works with Chrome's a
139:06 - built-in plugin and Sara says Adam has
139:09 - one a plug-in as well so awesome Thanks
139:14 - thanks for that information that's
139:15 - definitely a better answer for Annika
139:18 - then then I had oh and John Hanson says
139:25 - that Adam does have a built-in
139:26 - development preview so that's cool I
139:29 - didn't realize that the Adam theme I'm
139:33 - using is called the SETI theme its SETI
139:38 - the SETI theme inside the matrix says I
139:43 - use the live server plug-in and Adam and
139:46 - Visual Studio code to see live preview
139:48 - okay so that's I guess you can check out
139:51 - that plugin
139:52 - so that's uh that's pretty much all for
139:59 - the live chat really I think I did a
140:03 - good job of keeping up with everything
140:05 - so normally I go back through the live
140:08 - chat and answer questions but since I
140:10 - kind of stopped at several points and
140:13 - answered questions I don't think I need
140:14 - to go back if I did miss your question I
140:17 - I'm sorry about that do you can put it
140:21 - in the comments for this video and I'll
140:23 - answer it later on or you can just
140:25 - direct message me on twitter my the link
140:28 - to my twitter is in the description for
140:32 - the video so i think i'm going to end
140:36 - because the stream has been going on for
140:38 - almost two and a half hours now so it's
140:41 - going to be a very long stream and I'll
140:45 - figure out what's going on with this and
140:47 - I'll let you all know tomorrow what the
140:51 - problem ended up being and that's it so
140:58 - if anybody has actually I got something
141:02 - else in the lab chest
141:03 - see
141:06 - inside the matrix's sorry I couldn't
141:07 - help with the air
141:09 - I'm not learned and react or next yet
141:12 - yeah oh don't worry about it yeah I'm
141:13 - like I'll figure it out and you all
141:19 - helped me so much don't ever worry about
141:21 - not being able to help with a problem
141:23 - because I've gotten so much help and so
141:25 - much great information from you all and
141:28 - in the live chat and and so much
141:30 - encouragement too so you all have been
141:34 - great actually I mentioned at the
141:35 - beginning of the the stream that I had
141:39 - submitted proposals for a talk to a
141:44 - bunch of conferences last night and you
141:47 - can if you check out a tweet I had like
141:51 - last night so it still should be up at
141:53 - the top in my Twitter you can actually
141:54 - there's a link to see what the
141:56 - presentation is but just to save you the
141:58 - trip the the title of the the talk I'm
142:04 - pretty sure I titled it something like
142:05 - how live coding changed my life or
142:08 - something like that so it's really cool
142:10 - and basically it's all because of you
142:13 - it's not it's not actually the act of
142:16 - coding while talking it's it's all of
142:18 - you it's the interaction I've had with
142:20 - you all and how encouraging you've been
142:22 - and hopefully you've been in the
142:23 - community that's been built up so that's
142:26 - really the amazing thing that I think is
142:30 - it's just really it's really unique you
142:35 - know something I've never had before I
142:37 - usually work alone hey see you later
142:41 - Zanna then asked to go so I'm saying she
142:44 - said goodbye in the lab chat Oh see you
142:46 - hopefully tomorrow you can make it for
142:48 - the stream so anyway that's I always
142:52 - kind of never really knew what I would
142:55 - talk about at a conference that I could
142:57 - talk about maybe better than other
142:59 - people but I think this is something
143:01 - because I've experienced this now in
143:03 - this community so so I finally have
143:07 - something that I think it's worth you
143:10 - know I could do a good job and really
143:12 - you know tell people something that's
143:14 - that could be valuable
143:17 - I think I did apply to do a talk about
143:20 - next using next Jas with an API and all
143:23 - kind of stuff and react but I think
143:25 - there's a lot of other people that could
143:26 - give a talk like that too and probably
143:28 - better than me so I'd be happy to give
143:30 - that talk it would be more technical but
143:33 - I suppose it wouldn't be quite as unique
143:37 - as what I could could talk about in
143:40 - terms of the you know the live coding
143:44 - yeah so Jana asked where is the talk at
143:48 - so I don't really know I I apply to some
143:51 - some talks in the United States one in
143:54 - in England and oh no I don't have the
144:00 - talk on my channel yet so I haven't you
144:03 - know fully like thought out everything I
144:06 - would say I definitely have a lot of
144:08 - what I would say you know kind of in my
144:10 - head but if I get accepted to a
144:12 - conference to do it then I probably you
144:15 - know I'll do it all I was thinking I
144:17 - might even do like practice as a
144:19 - livestream you know just kind of
144:21 - practice the talk and get feedback
144:22 - before I actually have to give it at a
144:25 - conference so maybe I'll do that so I
144:27 - don't know I've never spoken at a
144:29 - conference at a tech conference before
144:31 - and so we'll see I might not get
144:34 - accepted at all but I think I'll
144:36 - probably just keep applying you know as
144:38 - I see things come up just keep applying
144:42 - to or submitting talk ideas and maybe
144:45 - I'll get one and maybe we could actually
144:47 - think it would be really cool if I got
144:49 - to go somewhere that was like near where
144:50 - one of one of you lived and then could
144:54 - have like an eat up or something of you
144:57 - know like freak freak out camp people or
145:00 - something that would be kind of fun but
145:04 - I don't know we'll see I think there's a
145:06 - conference in Argentina that I'm going
145:08 - to apply to as well but they want you to
145:10 - do like a three-minute video telling why
145:13 - you should be there so I need to make
145:14 - the video first like what else where
145:19 - else I applied some places in Florida in
145:22 - the United States
145:23 - I think conference in New York
145:27 - Tennessee Washington DC so kind of like
145:35 - all different places but anyway I don't
145:40 - want to I don't want to just kind of go
145:43 - on and on with with talking so I'm gonna
145:46 - wrap this up if anybody has any advice
145:49 - for me in terms of trying to get
145:51 - accepted into conferences that would be
145:54 - really awesome even if you just want to
145:56 - check out that link on Twitter to what I
145:58 - said to try to get in the conference I
146:00 - mean if you if you have any advice you
146:04 - know for just kind of the way I
146:05 - presented my idea about how I could do
146:07 - it better I'd really appreciate that cuz
146:10 - I don't know I think it would be really
146:12 - cool to share that like what's going on
146:14 - here with our little community with with
146:18 - more people I think it'd be really
146:19 - really helpful if like more people did
146:21 - did things like this so anyway is that's
146:27 - it that's all I got for today oh I'll be
146:32 - back tomorrow at 2 p.m. Eastern time and
146:37 - and until then have a great day see
146:41 - y'all tomorrow

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody its Jesse and uh today we're showing it a lot done and I actually want to try to get through like a whole a whole process usually I just work on random stuff and I don't always get it done so I want to go try to go start to finish and take you through the process of creating a custom post type in WordPress with custom fields populating that with some data getting that data pulling it into a reactor and we're gonna make a template in react to display that data and we want that a user to be able to go to a page and have that page automatically generated with a unique URL so we're gonna need to edit our server j/s file to be able to handle that so I want to get all of that done while I'm streaming so that's a lot of stuff but I've done it I don't want to say a lot but I've done it you know three or four times before you know recently so I think we can get it done I'm gonna check the live chat say hi hey everyone so I apologize in advance if I'm a little weird for this dream because I I only got like five hours of sleep last night so I was up I ended up not being super tired last night so I applied to speak at some conferences which is kind of exciting I've never applied to speak at conferences before so we'll see what happens I don't really know if I if my submissions were even any good because I've never even seen anyone's submission before but hopefully I at least get some good feedback you know even if I get rejected that would be kind of cool if you want to see my um what I submitted to some of the conference's it's available online so check my Twitter I sent out a link last night so that people could actually check out my idea for a talk and then this morning the baby was up really early so anyway that that's why I didn't get sleep but I'm gonna try my best to stay focused I do have one question for you all to start someone asks what my Twitter handle was Jeremy asks it's it's in the description for this show it's just it's Jesse are Weigel so jay esse r w e i GTL and let me I had one problem so I really wanted to get you all a link that you could go to to see all the updates so I started a dev branch that's gonna be like the cutting edge stuff the latest stuff that we're doing for this site and that is going to be updated at our server I don't know if anybody remembers when we set up the load balancing but we actually have three droplets running node and react and we are only a load balancing between two so I never shut down that third droplet because I always thought it would come in handy for testing and today it has come in handy so that's the droplet that I can just give you the IP address for and you all can can check it out now I did get it working but I just tried to update it and for some reason it quit working now here's what I think happened my session timed out when I was used logged into the server and I didn't use usually used p.m. to to start the server but I didn't even set it up I just started it you know with just a regular command just npm run start and I never shut down the server so right now I can't start the new server because port 8080 is already in use so normally I would shut it down by pressing ctrl C right but that doesn't work because at least I don't think it works I can sure you double check but I don't think that's gonna work for me yeah how do you shut down a node server from the command line if it's not actually like the process is not actually running in my command line right now like I'm I can't see it so if anybody knows how to do that let me know and then I can get this up and running and you all can have a place where you can check out all the latest stuff without having to download this repository and run a local server so I I'll figure it out eventually but I just figured maybe somebody is really familiar with node and just knows exactly what command I need okay Patrick did have Patrick had a good comment he asked about the on change event with materialized so okay cool so I've gotten the the command so let's go sudo kill all node is that it which other so anyway yesterday we couldn't I couldn't get this select thing to work and I said that I would let you all know how I ended up getting it to work so let me let me do that now all right cool so that works so if you go to let me find the IP for you I'll paste this IP address in the live chat and it's the IP address is 1 6 2.2 4 3.8 6.67 and maybe if I can remember I'll put it in the shared description so anyway this will show the latest stuff so this will actually show you that this is working now all right so the only thing this is the only thing that actually has a working category right now I'm pretty sure nothing else has been put into categories but that is working I'll show you how I got it working in a second also for some reason these borders on this top one just start coming and going I haven't replaced the borders with hrs yet so I need to do that but I did get this working so I have this little toggle here and this is just changing the state within the component so within the component there's a display content set automatically to false if it's false it displays this when you click it it sets the state to true and displays the Falaise this and this one when you click it it sets the state back to false so let me show you the code for how I got this working and then we'll get started on on what I actually described in the title in the description for this video so within that's material select that's what we have so within material select what I've done is basically just gotten rid of all the materialized stuff so I'm not initializing the materialized I should give some background in case you weren't watching yesterday and you're not sure what I'm talking about I'm using the materialized framework it's a CSS framework it uses some jQuery stuff and changes the Dom so it's not ideal for react but we've made it work so far and this is the only time we've run into an issue where I just couldn't get it to work I was spending way too much time yesterday getting it to work I probably should have given up on it sooner but it just didn't even occur to me during the stream until the very end so what I did normally what materialized does is if you have a select input it goes through all the options and then it creates new Dom nodes for new elements and it creates a new ul and then each option becomes an Li within that ul so that all happens after you know with with jQuery so that's not really registered in react now that wasn't even the main issue so that was one issue but the main issue was that whenever we changed that select input that event wasn't registering for react so when I try to have this on change handler to do something it wouldn't do anything it didn't recognize the change it would actually run it was weird it would run twice on render that was because it would actually render once and run and then it would make an API call to populate all these options and then re render and then we'll run another time but then when I actually tried to change the select input to select one of these options it wouldn't fire off an event so that's that's an issue with materialized and and react so I think that the issue is probably on the side of materialized and how it's done it's not I don't think it's a react issue from what I can understand there were some some pool requests to try to fix that but I don't think that it seems like the maintainer zuv materialized don't see that as a bug and they just recommended using the react materialized framework which is an attempt to make materialized work with react and turn everything into react components so so I don't think there's any chance anytime soon of that being changed so just in case you're trying to use materialized as well you can either go the route that I did or you can try to use react materialize instead or try to do some type of custom fix but I'll show you you know basically what I did is now I'm using just a plain select input I did do some extra styling so I could make it fit in so let me show you I mean obviously this doesn't look like your default select input when you click it this looks like browser default right I can't really do much about this browser default and it'll look slightly different depending on the browser but you know assuming I want to stick with a select input and not try to do something some type of custom list which I don't really want to do it right now it would be okay but it would be a lot of work I think for a slight improvement and I'm running out of time to work on this site so I just changed things so that it mimics the look of this search box okay so and how I accomplished that was with all of this it's really big mostly because of all these vendor prefixes which I think if you put things within the style JSX tag it actually Auto prefixes for you but I had copied this over from a previous project where I had figured out everything I need to do to style this in the materialized fashion so I didn't I didn't try to redo that I just copied it over so it's not hurting anything to have the vendor prefixes in there and it's working so I'm not gonna mess with it and then I just needed to add in this this part at the bottom let me bring make this a bit bigger I think is this is a bit smaller than I normally have it so I had to add in this the reason I couldn't put it right here in the style JSX tag was because of this so it thought I was trying to incorrectly escape something within this string because of the slash so it wouldn't work so if you try to use content and then you know one of these this basically makes that that little try upside down triangle they call it a carrot that's the little code to make that so if you're trying to do something like that it won't work in style of JSX so this code is all on github you can check it out under the dev branch so if you want to kind of look into how I did this place it's not really a lot it just looks like a lot because the vendor prefixes and a lot of it is just trying to override browser default things all right so that's pretty much it I'm gonna check the live stream now see if there's any questions about that before we get started okay we have somebody card carnage I'm not sure how to pronounce the name kar IE KR n IE j carnage I don't know sorry about not know not to pronounce that but anyway says hi everybody I'm looking for a job react job so I guess so hopefully you you can pick up some react knowledge on this stream if anything you can probably pick up some mistakes to avoid when you when you do this my stream is really good at demonstrating the pitfalls and mistakes that can be made and sometimes even how to fix them but anyway I'm not sure that anybody watching now or in the live chat is hiring so I don't know that I can help you but anyway I keep keep us updated on the job search I'd love to hear how it goes okay the will Frank says long time viewer first day hey how's it going thanks for saying hi I realized there's probably a lot of people who watch who never speak in a live chat which is totally cool I'm actually am usually pretty quiet and chats and things myself when I'm watching so I totally understand and maybe you're just doing other things and not a computer yours feel like listening or watching but don't be shy if you can if you can say hi that would be cool because I noticed you know there's always the the analytics shows that there's always way more viewers than people talking in the live chat and today we actually have fewer of yours than we've been having normally so I don't know what happened maybe the topic is not great today it's still a decent amount of years though so I think we have like 40 right now which is I mean that's I'm always amazed that anybody wants to watch me cuz forty or forty three now cool person I see react a Fabian how's it going haha Evo says hi Jesse not James's son hey how's it going that yesterday Evo accidentally called me James in the chat which was just fine that it didn't bother me bill says hey it worked but listening in the background today awesome that's that's cool that's why I imagine that's probably a lot of people may be in the same situation especially if they're in a similar time zone to where I'm at because this is the time when people are normally at work John said is it not always with the more simple coding it saves the day all these things like reactor webpack other complex systems for me at least now is overkill yeah I I agree to some extent that I'll react webpack all that stuff increases the complexity and increases the possibility for bugs so if you don't need to use those things for what you're trying to accomplish you you are probably better off not using them but for a lot even you know if you're trying to learn them there's no reason not to do a small project with it because if if your purpose is not just to produce a product if your purpose is to learn then you know make something simple with react I I actually uh a few weeks ago when I was on vacation I built the free code camp weather app I don't know if you all remember that challenge is kind of early on in free code camp challenges but I built that I rebuild it and react I had built it once just with some jQuery and I did it just simply to get some practice and to learn it definitely doesn't need to be built and react but but anyway to speak to John's point that definitely was the case this time with materialize it was trying to do all this other stuff and beyond what a normal select input does and you know the select input that's been in HTML for for years and years worked fine for this use case so it was definitely the solution and better off hey Zanna says hi hey how's it going glad you can watch Jordan asks how do you hook up WordPress with react okay cool I'm going to show you today how we hook up WordPress with react so I'm not going to explain it right now because we're I'll be able to show it to you we're gonna do it during this this stream and I'll start that in just a minute I just wanted to say hi to everybody and you know at the beginning of the live chat before I get get to the code ego says John if you have this many modules of stuff to keep track of a tool like web pack is a lifesaver react is also really nice and I think that they will become even more prevalent yeah that's true that's a good point you know like if your project is complex it ends up helping to have things like react and webpack like yesterday I showed you all that I think it was yesterday I showed you all that mess that was the the jQuery site that I had made which basically did a lot of the same stuff that this site does but I built it all with jQuery and it was just a bunch of crazy spaghetti code and it's really hard to maintain now I really can't wait until I have the time to rebuild that in react so in that case using something simpler than react which was I would argue that jQuery is probably simpler than react at least it's simpler to learn but that ended up being worse as the project got more complex so I think there ends there's a tipping point in the project of you know where some of these tools actually do end up helping Zanna asks did you debug it Zen are you talking about the the select input thing that was happening so I don't know maybe you might have joined in right after I explained it so sorry if you missed it but basically yeah I did get it working and I just went with a normal select input so I just got rid of the stuff that materialized was glowing and just went with a normal select input everything worked fine and I just did some styling to make it look like it was it fit with the materialize styling all right so think I'm gonna I'm gonna scan through quickly the rest to see on the live chat and then I'm gonna get started okay bill bill said he watched the replays of the last two streams and at one point in yesterday's streams I accidentally showed his project instead of my project and he says it's cool though because it was on github as opensource so yeah sorry about that I mean I'm glad that it's cool and everything but I'll have to be more careful about doublechecking what I show I try to keep everything that shouldn't be shown on my other screens okay so they all go asks about the Auto prefixing the CSS inside the JSX I'm not sure I think the I think if you use next J s the Auto prefixing everything comes builtin so I I don't know I have to check it out I just always assumed it was Auto prefixing I thought I saw that before in my code that it was all in a prefix but now that I really think about it I would have to double check to say 100% for sure so don't take my word for it without doublechecking but I'm pretty sure it does get Auto prefixed as long as it's inside the style da J or the style JSX tags okay okay so Zanna did didn't hear the explanation the beginning so I gave us a slightly longer explanation and I showed the code so Zanna if you if you get a chance later on you can watch like the first 10 minutes of the stream or something the recording and get a longer explanation okay I'll wait Patrick centerlink what's the link Patrick I'll check it out of my sheep okay that's weird okay so this should check this out I'm probably not gonna fix this right now I'll do it later since I want to do something else on the stream but Patrick just sent this so what browser was that that's it on Ubuntu with with chrome okay well that's no good so I'll have to work on that Danny but if anybody else checked this out let me know if you're having anything similar happening obviously like Chrome on a Mac it looks like this it works blown on Ubuntu it looks like this I mean I really want it to work but realistically there's probably no actual user of this site who's like in the target audience that would be using Ubuntu so if that's the only place where this happens I probably won't worry about it just because I don't have a lot of time yet so I gotta worry about you know the other browsers more browser operating system combinations more but yeah I'm gonna have to take a look at that although I really won't have a good way to test it because I don't I don't have Kubuntu and I don't even think you can test that on browser stack off to check I don't think you can test it on Linux let's see okay Patrick just said the same thing that there's not a lot of site people going to the site with Linux okay it's good to know the and I'm definitely going to check it out with some other combinations of operating systems and browsers devices to make sure that there's not similar errors happening elsewhere so thanks for sending that so Oh actually I did want to before I started I wanted to mention a little bit about the net neutrality thing that's happening so especially for those in in the United States right now there's like some the federal government has some stuff going on where basically it could end up being really bad for the internet like things could be blocked like so I wanted to show some of you may have already seen this but there's these videos that are they're really short so I think I'm just going to show this video quickly this net neutrality video which we'll be able to kind of explain things a lot better than I can and let me try to bring this over I think it's just only a few minutes so let me throw this on here yeah oh it's not even it's 33 seconds so okay so anyway that was just a really basic of what's happening so if you're if you're interested and just putting your name out there as being against this then you know check out the the URL which was battle for the Netcom so and today is like the official day I think where a lot of stuff is happening to raise awareness and kind of protest that possibility of the internet being you know way more regulated by companies and different than it than it is now and then it probably should be alright let's see I just want to check the live chat really quick to see what other errors you are getting okay so Windows 10 in chrome is the same issue so okay so Evo says Evo's found the error already which is awesome thank you so much you have a color value of inherit in the CSS rule button for input select area which comes from materialized okay alright so evidently there's something being being applied from materialize the materialized framework that's affecting that so oh so I'll check that out okay let me open post the link to the dev site again for for those either came in a little bit later so I have a 1/3 droplet now that's running the dev branch so I'll try to keep it updated with the latest dev stuff so until I get approval for the changes from the people higher up than they I'm not gonna make them since they're really significant changes for for a lot of pages I'm not I'm not just gonna try to make them live on my own I need to get some approval first so for now they're gonna exist only on this at this IP address and okay cool Evo is gonna open a github issue with an explanation of what's going on with that select input so I'll definitely check that out and actually if anyone is kind of shaky with the JavaScript skills but is really good with their CSS that will probably end up being a CSS only solution that might be good to contribute so otherwise I mean I'm I'm sure it'd only take me a few minutes to figure it out but especially for new people who are trying to get some some more things on the github profile that might be kind of an easy thing to do so enough of this we're gonna work on something totally different so I'm gonna move this off the screen and I'm gonna do this off the screen and what a bunch of stuff off the screen I can keep this on the screen also yesterday one more thing just continuing from yesterday yesterday I had a pool request from Rene which switched over to using preact instead of react and it made things smaller the bundle size for production was smaller a lot smaller so when I tried to use it on this test server I was getting an error I was saying R is not a function so I'm not sure what was going on it worked fine locally but when I tried to actually build it and run it I was getting there so I ended up not merging that pool request I didn't accept it yet I'm not saying I won't accept it but I just need to get it working on the actual server first so so I added I added that to to the actual pool request I added a comment about it so if anybody has any ideas for that you know please you know comment there on that on that pool request on github ok so today what we're gonna do let's start with WordPress first so I'm gonna do I'm gonna start here in our WordPress plugin so you've probably seen this before this is a wordpress plugin that we're using to make a bunch of custom post types so here's what we what we need to do here's the the kind of the end goal for the user the user needs to be able to click on a link that will be like the title of a PDF document right so in the about page we're going to create something to display these links some new section but I don't want them to just link to PDF documents right because that's that's no good for search engine optimization I'm not really sure how screen readers handle that so I'd rather have these PDFs converted into HTML but I also want the PDFs available to download so I'd like a user to be able to go to the about page see a list of the titles of these PDFs click on it when they click it opens up an entirely new page on a react site that has the contents of that PDF in HTML and then also has a button to be able to download the PDF and I want that all to be editable from within WordPress so we're gonna make a custom post type I guess a PDF page post type and it needs to have your normal title and content fields which are there by default but then we're gonna add one custom field that's going to be the URL of the PDF and actually we should probably might want to do the title field should be good I kind of thought maybe we might want to do a separate field for PDF title but I think the title field should be enough that we could pull into use for the link text so that should that's all we need to do on the wordpress side and then we'll come in we'll build the the page that that's going to be populated we'll build out the section that needs to be in the about page and then we'll update our code in our server das file to direct people to the right place and make the right API call to get that data so let me copy so I think you you I've done this before on a stream so I'm just gonna copy this did I get the I don't know if I got the top part so I'm doing it again so I'm going to copy this and paste it now I'm just gonna change all of these and I wanted to say instead what did I say was a PDF PDF page yeah I think that'll I think that'll be obvious to the people who are editing it what I would that is okay so this is how it will display these are all the display names that'll be like in the WordPress admin panel and then these are the names that'll be in the code so let's make PDF all right so now I'm gonna say that oops actually I'm not gonna save it okay copy this let me bring over my WordPress admin panel here so I need to login I just let me bring this over and I need to upgrade to the newest version so I was just waiting to do a backup so I have one of my coworkers purchase a subscription for this backup plugin that we can use on and I think an unlimited amount of site so I'm just waiting to get the info about how to install that because generally you don't want to really do too many updates on a wordpress site without backing it up I've done a lot of updates on small sites without backing up and I've never actually had anything happen but it's a good practice to to do the backups if you can so you can manually you don't need a plugin you can manually do the backups but I don't have like PHP myadmin installed or anything like that so I just I don't really feel like doing the backups from the command line and I'm not even sure I have SSH access to this droplet so let's go actually that I have no idea why that I've keeping this so small we'll make it a bit bigger and I'll increase the size so y'all can see what's going on so I'm gonna go into plugins here and I'm gonna find I passed it up there you see I custom types that's our plugin and I'm gonna edit now if I did have I don't I don't really have any access to this server either FTP access or SSH for some reason the accesses and it isn't working I didn't set this up someone else set it up and so I just never figured out what the issue was so this is why I'm updating the plugin like this normally I wouldn't update like this I would probably probably use FTP and just open the file directly in my editor but this works too so all I've done is just copy and paste of the new stuff I'm going to update it also I mean normally it wouldn't be a great idea to update stuff on a live WordPress installation anyway I'm pretty confident though since we we changed a minor thing that it should be fun and since everything if you mess up something in a plugin you like very quickly realize that you mess it up in WordPress like you'll get this white I think it's like a white screen or something and you can't log in your site so if that happens you want to go in with FTP or SSH whatever you can and just rename the plugin folder of the plugin that you just changed is causing the problem and then that'll let you get back at least into your site and have your site running again and then you can revert to a previous version or whatever you change you can revert it back and try to figure it out best thing to do would be to have a a dev version of WordPress that you can test it out on first which I did not have set up for this yet but I may end up setting it up at some point so let's check out our PDF pages alright so now we have our PDF pages so you can see it's just like a normal wordpress post right just basic stuff we do want to add one field though and for that I'm gonna use a plug and I'm not gonna custom code that so let's get on our custom fields plugin and we're gonna add a new group and we'll call this PDF page info and I'm gonna we're going to make sure that it shows that it only applies when the post type is equal to PDF page I'm gonna add a field the field label is going to be actually I was gonna make it PDF URL but it should probably be an upload so let me see file okay so we will upload that I kind of didn't want to at first because I wasn't sure I wanted to have all the PDFs hosted there on the site but they'll probably be less room for error if the PDF just gets uploaded and I can pull the URL otherwise it's gonna be someone manually copying and pasting or typing out a URL and then two things could happen that I could see either they mess up the URL and it doesn't work or something happens to the place where that PDF is hosted so even if just the change in the file name occurred then the link wouldn't work anymore or that server could be down or something so it probably is better if we just have the PDF there it within the WordPress and it's a droplet on digitalocean I could always upgrade the storage if I need to if things start to get crazy I don't really anticipate that that much will get uploaded that I would need to upgrade stores so this should probably I'm actually not I'm not gonna require this because the way we're gonna display this the way I want to display this is I want these pages to be just informational pages so it's not gonna say right away that these are just PDF conversions the PDFs almost gonna be like an afterthought like if you want the PDF version here it is so in case there's at some point down the road they want to just include some information in this page without actually include having a PDF version I'm gonna make this not required and I want to return the file URL and that should be it now we can let's see I want to put this up high after the title so it's really obvious I do want to put this in the standard meta box I think the seamless kind of looks a bit nicer but it's more familiar for users to put it in the standard box so what what I don't need here so I want to hide the permalink I want to keep the content editor so when we're only using WordPress for the API we can hide a lot of things because they won't really work so we don't need the exurbs we don't need the custom fields because this isn't talking about the custom field we just made this would have been if we if we added custom fields through WordPress has kind of like a builtin way to do custom fields that's not nearly as userfriendly and powerful as this plugin we don't need discussion comments revisions could be helpful the slug is unnecessary authors unnecessary format I'm gonna hide featured image for now I don't think we'll be including images at least a featured image and I'm not gonna worry about categories or tags and another track back so this is going to simplify the UI significantly so you'll see when we go back in there will be a lot less than there was originally so I'm going to publish that and now let's go back in we'll add a new page okay see so here's our file input so we can add a file and actually this PDF I'm just gonna put this PDF in just a little have something and let's add a title test page and let's grab some just some some text to throw in there and I just grabbed some some bacon ipsum which is a taste to your version of lorem ipsum we don't really need the sharing buttons but I didn't see an option to get rid of these so I'm not worried about it now it won't make a difference whether this is checked or not but we can see you know really there's it's really simple for people to edit things in here there's not much that can be done so I'm gonna publish this and that's all we need to do on the wordpress side of things so it should be it should be enough for us just to have this one instance of it we kinda think there's really only one spot where we would display more than one set of data and that's that's one the about page so we may have to just hard code in some some other examples just to see what it will look like but this should be fine for now so that's it for the wordpress side of things and we'll check out the wordpress api now just to make sure that we're getting the data and as soon as you see the data I'm gonna go I'm gonna check back in the live stream because that's kind of the end of part one of our little mini project here so I want to check out the PDF pages oops was a PDF page there we go PDF page so here we go so when we make an API call to get a PDF page this is what we'll get back we actually don't need all of this data so we'll probably filter it down because we'll just need the content and we'll get the URL here we go here's our PDF upload URL so that's pretty much all we need and the title alright so we have that and I can move this over I don't think we need it anymore now I'm gonna go to the live chat quickly next step is going to be editing our about page to give users somewhere to actually click to get to our new page that we're gonna make all right so I'm gonna scroll up a bit in a live chat see what I missed okay Evo just added the github issue thank you so much for that the issue about the appearance of the Select okay Jeremy is bringing up there's a slack channel now for for free code camp it's FCC pair programming slack calm and Joe says FCC just keeps getting better every day awesome I like that that comment okay it looks like Zanna has included some images of that select input as well from Ubuntu on Firefox and Chrome okay so it looks like on Firefox it actually is working I'll put it on the screen quickly so it's working but it's black in the background so this might be a little bit more challenging than I thought because you know the we need it to show up the text to show up is white when it's selected and we can't just simply make it black because it wouldn't show up in Firefox so off to think that one through a bit more to make sure that the text is readable I'm trying to think the last time I did this it was on a white background so I didn't have the same issues I mean as possible I could just change this so that it's not on a black background anymore if I can't find some way to make this work and then that would just solve the issues because we would have a darkcolored font and it should work all the time because this this then would have a white background instead so anyway we'll see actually what do you all think about this black bar anyway so I've gotten some feedback from coworkers and the feedback so far was at first it was a little jarring but it only took you know a minute or so to get used to it and then it was it was okay so not great feedback I mean I would rather have wow this looks amazing so I'm not I'm still not sure about it myself now that I've been looking at it for so long I'm used to it but I just kind of I didn't want to just all white you know I wanted something else here to kind of set these off you know these controls these filters off from the rest of the content so if anyone has any other ideas let me know and I'm definitely open to some alternatives I mean I need to be careful I can't spend too much on it so if it's at a point where it's good enough I'll probably just have to leave it because we're running out of time so I don't I don't really want to mess with it too much but a color change shouldn't be that big of a deal you know if I really find a color that that I like I'm open to spending the time to change it okay yeah and so in regard to the slack Channel yeah I can't so a few people are saying they couldn't get into the slack Channel they need an invitation or something I had the same issue I couldn't get into the slack Channel either let me I think I still have it up on my screen somewhere at least I did I've way too many windows open I'm not sure here it is I find it yeah so this is what I'm getting signin to FCC pair programming and when I try to signin I can't so it says contact the team administrator and I'm not sure who the team administrator is or what their contact information is so has anybody been able to get in if so how okay his Hannah says all that is a bit unintuitive can you just use categories instead I'm not sure I'm trying to look at the timestamp for that was that in regard to to this bar here you know Evo says I don't really like that people are now using slack as a new generation of email maybe I'm just stubborn or getting old he says I'm twenty but I just can't really get used to it so I'm not sure that that 20 is old I guess if you're a kid 20 years old but yeah i'm i like slack but I'm not sure that slack is a actual email alternative I use slack for different things that I would never normally send an email for so I know there are people saying like slacks gonna kill email like emails that I don't buy that I emails probably gonna be around for a long time because everybody's used to it it works but slack is really cool for what it does and so I like I like that if I want to send a quick message to somebody that would be a waste of time to send in an email slack is really great for that okay so I'm getting some feedback about that section maybe change it from black to the like the red color and then that may that may look better okay Zanna says maybe like just leave it leave it white but add like a border a thin border at the bottom and the top or even like John said to make it make it that red color okay I'll have to try that out oh okay I see what is n I see what you're trying to say here so then let me let me try to explain what I think you're saying you could let me know if I got it right here so instead of having the word all right here which doesn't really say much have it say like categories or something and that would that would make more sense I did originally have it saying choose a category but I got an error so basically I had to like add in manually that the the word selected into that into that element into that option and then react gave me a warning it wasn't really an error message gave me a warning saying not to do that I don't know why I shouldn't do that but I could definitely change that back so that category is the first thing actually that would make sense it would definitely work if I would just say choose a category is the first thing that people say it's not going to be disabled the problem right now is it's disabled and greyed out a little bit I'll just make it have the same value as all and then that way it'll show everything if someone happens to click on it again who cares it'll still show everything or they would just naturally click on all okay yeah I think I'll do that I think I might actually do that right now since it's such a small change it would be better just to do it I mean I have it open already so let me I do want to double check would I put my I lost my terminal I just wanted to check to see if I had anything that was not committed here it is okay so it's clean you know obviously I'm gonna start doing a lot of stuff directly on the dead branch and just kind of merging in all the different branches that I've been working on into dev like as they start to get closer to being done so I'll take out disabled and I'll put in a zero and then that should automatically make it the first option so I say that it didn't Auto refresh there we go so that works better you can click all here what you want to make sure this works if I click choose a category it still works us all okay so that look better okay Patrick says get some Patrick suggested saying all categories Johnson's and categories yeah I think any of that work I probably I'm just gonna keep this just so that I don't spend any more time on it but anyway yeah I'm glad that that you brought that up because okay Patrick likes what I ended up with I'm glad you brought that up because I it was something I had thought of earlier and I thought the same thing that it would be weird and then I just kind of gotten used to it and and just kind of forgot about it and I never like I never wrote it down usually make a little note in Trello when I think something like that but for some reason I didn't and so just kind of forgot so it's really good to have all these people looking at it you know all of you looking at it and you know just in general on a project it's great to have other people look at it because when you're building it you just get used to certain things and take for granted that people are gonna understand it so it's really like I mean doesn't really matter how good you are as a developer I think that's it's just like a natural thing is that you can't look at it with fresh eyes like the user would a new user because you've been looking at it for so long I mean maybe if you waited a year and then looked at it again and you've forgotten it you know that would be the only way but I mean who has time to wait that long okay so that looks a lot better now let me commit that I'd hate to commit make a commit for such a small change but the other changes we're going to be doing you're so unrelated that I'd rather just just do it so so we're gonna commit we're gonna get commit and then we're gonna use the flag am so this will add the file and make the message at the same time so we don't separate it into two steps and let's see this is gonna change default option resource category select okay that works probably what's gonna happen is I'm gonna change that at some point so if I end up using a select somewhere else in the site I'll probably make this option be like a prop that you could pass in the text for this option I think that's the only thing that would have to change everything else could stay the same and it would work possibly like some of the colors could end up being options that get passed in but that would really be it then then it would make this component like fully reusable and as possible am I using okay so I'm not really using any colors here so this could stay and that would oh yeah I am I'm using this color so potentially I could just pull this and include it here so that the color could actually be a prop as well so I'm not gonna do it now but if I do end up using this again I'll pull that in and then it will be reusable all right so we need to bring up the about page cuz that's what we're gonna be working on and let me go back I wanna check the last shot just really quick let's see I'm bare toasters I wish I could open source this HR portal page so is that I'll bear are you is that what you're working on now and you not allowed to open source it that's things I I I definitely prefer at least now definitely now that I'm doing streaming I prefer to work on things that can be open source Patrick is bringing up the new stuff and NPM five point two point zero is NTX it's a new command that's really useful so you could do like npx create react app new app it'll grab the latest create react app without polluting the global node that's cool yeah I saw some stuff on Twitter about it but I didn't really read into it anymore so people on Twitter seem to think it was really really useful so I have to check that out hey Sebastian's here how's it going yeah Sebastian pretty much all you missed I kind of explained how I fixed the select input from yesterday and I made a custom post type with a custom field in WordPress so we haven't really done too much with react yet and we're about to jump into that right now okay so in Patrick just put a link in to a medium article about npx so if you can get to the live chat and check out the the link then that should tell you a bit more about it I'm not even gonna attempt to read out the link because it's super long all right so we're on the about page the first thing let's just look at it and figure out where we're gonna put this thing so here's our about page now so let's see all right so this will definitely can stay down at the bottom this is the least important section I'm not sure I'm thinking probably we could probably put a new section here and that would make sense just visually it would break up this kind of double whitespace section since most you know we're breaking it up everywhere else so probably another red section something you make maybe another another red section in between here I'll probably give it a title just as more information for now and then if if it needs to change then it can change it's not really a big deal so that section will say more information and then it can have its I mean it's really just gonna have lists of links I don't think there's that many links right now I think it's like at most six or seven but it could potentially be more so would like to think of a way that it won't get too cluttered up if there's more I'll think about it let's just start to throw in some code now and then see how it looks and then think about right now I'm thinking maybe just like two columns of links and there they're gonna be Auto populated from an API call so I'll just have to figure out some way to distribute them between the two rows evenly and then hopefully the list I mean if the list ends up being like a hundred links it's going to be a super long section I'm okay with that I guess because I said I think the collaborator section is probably not really that helpful to users so not really not really a big deal all right so let's go back and unfortunately this is super long because I haven't transferred any of this stuff over to being pulled from the WordPress API so it's it's all just hardcoded in here but what I want to do is grab the red section that we're already using and I'll just copy and paste that down here and then that way we don't have to waste time typing in code that we've already typed in so this is a collaborator section that's the start of it so we want to pop this in right here and so we actually we need to put in this new section here let's see where if you like container put in another row here and we'll call this I don't remember what I originally was going to call this I'm just going to put information there for now we don't want this flourish white because actually I never ended up building yeah I think I don't think this is doing anything right now this was supposed to do something a long time ago and I guess I never removed it that was one of the things that just got pushed to the side as not really necessary to get done before we launched okay so we'll have that and we're gonna want two columns let's get rid of all this we don't need it and s12 is fine but we want to make this m6 and that'll give us our two columns and inside here you have EUL and then Ally and we're gonna have an a Atrus okay I just want to fill this in a bit to give us an idea of what were what it's gonna look like okay so let's see okay not great just look great right now let's see so obviously we want to change it I'll probably make these I think it'll look a lot better if they're both centerline obviously the the color is gonna change to be white you probably do with making the the font size for the links a bit bigger and maybe like some more space between the list items since they're gonna be things that people are going to want to click on I want to make sure there's enough space especially so on mobile people don't accidentally click you know users with big thumbs have trouble hitting target so I think you usually want to have at least 48 yes so that's only 20 pixels tall the click target for that's only 20 pixels so the Li itself is even only 25 pixels tall so we definitely want to make this bigger increasing the font size will help to but then maybe we'll increase the line height so I want to at least hit like 40 pixels and that should be decent for for people even with with larger thumbs okay so hook like you remember all that so new color Center it increase the font size and then we'll check it out let's see I think I'm just going to give this a class this section of class of PDF links all right and now that we have that PDF links then we can target this down in our style JSX section here and let's go with make I want to make sure I override anything that materializes doing so otherwise I guess I wouldn't normally need to be that specific but I don't want to mess around that should be specific enough there that'll work so we want to deal it a color of white and let's do a font size of let's try 22 and see how that looks we also want we want to Center it so we want to Center that within the columns actually we don't I'm not gonna put that down here because we already have a class for that I think this will work if we do if I put on this row this might work to the line Center it's just Center I think it is so I'm trying to remember with the materialized classes for this I think it's just Center so let's see what that did alright cool what did everything so here we have it here's all our links we did get a little bit bigger here but I think it's still not big enough for a target yeah so it's the only 25 pixels so I don't know that I want to go any bigger with the font size so maybe we'll just add some padding to these links and then maybe a little Morgan we'll see so down here let's give it some padding and let's get let's give it a pixel all around and then between these allies let's give normally I would flip the order of this I don't know that it bothers me but I guess it'll be okay for now let's give it a margin of let's see let's go I don't want a huge margin so let's go four pixels and then zero on the sides there so this when you only have to the first number it first unit is the top and bottom margin and the second one is the left and right margin don't know what did I do I messed something up let me just try to give it a refresh maybe that's all yeah there we go remember that when something weird happens just refresh before you panic alright so now we have a area that we can click on of what is it like 40 what was that 40 it's actually 41 over a little bit it's actually not exactly how I wanted it so let's mess around in dev tools here for a little bit and see two one so I increase this a bit and we'll see so this is our a tag and these are L eyes and what was happening let me try to exaggerate this so we can really see what's going on so let's make this spacing bigger okay that's actually a bit better there's like some overlap where the click target will seem like it was down here in the spot so that's too much spacing but I might go with like 8 pixels let's see weekend I don't know if you can tell that I'll try to zoom in so that what's happening is the click area is kind of bleeding over into the area of the margin so I might get rid of the margins on the lis and just put it directly on the a tags and see how that is because otherwise I don't want there to be I'd rather have there be a slight gap of the the clink targets so let's just pull this and for now just get rid of that okay so I want to see how it's working hmm and that's what I thought would happen there we go so initially what had happened is it wasn't working because of the way it was displayed now it's definitely working I switched to displayblock but now that's too much so might not even need a margin Oh actually no I definitely don't want it to displayblock because then it's gonna go across so let's take that out and now that's not gonna change it alright I'm not gonna mess with this anymore it works I just like oh maybe I'll actually test it on a phone just to see maybe I'm worrying over nothing and it would be fine to click I think this is too much space between the lists and the heading here so I'm gonna remove some of that space other than that it looks weird because these titles are really small but the titles are definitely gonna be bigger everything on this project has huge titles so I'm more worried about having not enough space for the titles and then wrapping onto another line okay so we'll just leave this kind of as is and then get rid of this space and then we'll be done with that for now and we'll we'll work on the page and then obviously we're gonna want to pull this in this date in through the API for now lo I want to just get all the pieces working before adding that extra complexity of pulling in the data okay so let me remove remove this margin for now we'll just keep the padding let's actually let me I want to see what's causing this space so it looks like we do have a margarine on the bottom of that div but we also have a margin on the H tag I'll try getting rid of the well we have a margin on the UL so we have quite a few margins going on here if I get rid of the margin on the h2 and on the div that should be enough I'd rather do that then come to mess with the UL all right so I'm going to do some inline Styles now and in react you can you do inline styles as JavaScript objects so the first bracket your in JavaScript and then the second bracket may put you in an object so we're gonna go marginbottom we're gonna camelcase it and we're gonna say zero and then I'm just gonna copy that and paste it on this h2 as well and let's see and that did not any refresh okay let me restart my server and since I'm restarting it this would be a good time to check in with the live chat okay so John has says how about instead of a new section to break up the white space you just had a thin red bar above collaborators on the about page minimalistic and the page content seems filled up enough okay I mean I I obviously didn't see that before I already did this so I'm gonna keep I probably keep this section the same because I already just made it but I actually kind of liked that idea I'm gonna keep that in mind for if I need to add other sections because I don't like being tied into like always having to break things up in the same way John so we have two John's so the first round I just talked to is John be the next one this is John John Hanson says the API data I'm guessing JSON yes it's JSON is this type of file difficult to gzip from the server the project I built went live but all testing shows JSON only file type not compressed done hmm I don't actually don't have experience with that can you can you gzip JSON files from the server I don't I don't know does anybody have any experience with that all right Zanna thanks for answering the the question about the editor Patrick said Patrick said that says yes he likes this question when it gets this question we are getting dangerously far and we were getting dangerously far into the stream without someone asking which would break the streak of every stream so thanks yes thanks for asking that I honestly don't know if it's been asked every stream I'd have to go back and watch them which I probably won't do because as is the case I think with most people but the sound of my own voice just sounds really weird so I usually don't watch my streams often occasionally I'll watch just to see if I can like improve things sometimes I watch to see if I'm saying filler words a lot like um and things which I do and I try to work on huh but it's been a streak of enough episodes that I think we have an official streak going so we'll just we'll just try to keep it going well we are an hour in already crazy actually even more than an hour and when did I start I started it too huh okay John Henson says is it not 44 pixel height and the width minimum for four button links are the reason for using pixels over em2 your website I'm not really sure why you would want to use eeehm or pixels I'm just used to pixels so I can guess I can usually visualize how many pixels the thing will be on the screen because I'm used to pixels I'm not good at visualizing at all what eeehm would be so that's why I use pixels the only other unit I ever use are vh + VW that's also easy to visualize because it's just a percentage of the screen but I'm sure it's probably whatever you used to would be what you end up using unless there's some other other reason why you would want to use a different unit on jar says using REM or e/m is a good practice so yeah I just I see a lot of people using it I'm just not sure why what the benefit is to using it so if anybody knows I'd be open to to hearing about the benefit to using that I don't really know that I would switch at this point since I'm so used to using text the benefit would have to be really big for me to try to switch right now since I'm I've gotten really good at just being able to visualize things in in pixels so I would need a really good reason to switch from it Oh someone's name in the lab chat is inside the matrix that's awesome a great name I used to be a huge matrix fan like back you know when the first matrix came out oh no way all right so bill says there's an app called like so that you can start when you do a stream that will help analyze use of filler words I'm gonna have to look that up because I listened really early on in one of my first streams I listened through the whole thing and I couldn't stand it I used the word um so often it drove me nuts and then on the next stream I apologized profusely to everyone for making them sit through all of that so I really made an effort afterwards to stop that but I think I'm slipping back into it especially on days like this where I'm pretty tired and I'm mostly focusing on on the code so once I get started and I'm talking about something it's usually better but what I'm trying to code and talk at the same time or read things off of the live chat I do say I'm a lot I guess that's normal but I'd still like to quit doing it if I could jonbi says I was so upset they didn't name the sequel's the matrices so this equals to the matrix I like that one Jeremy says I don't even know this filler words my dude so cool yeah I actually read a study where they said that so some people tried to stop using filler words by talking more slowly and pausing instead of using filler words but they did a study where people were more I wanna say how did it go basically people had a much more negative view of speakers who took long pauses then of speakers who use filler words so if it's a choice between pausing and filler words you're better off using filler words so I guess I guess it could be worse than using filler words all right so let me get back to this so this is for now good enough so that we can click on it and make sure it goes to the right place which is all I really am going for for now so now the next step is going to be let me commit this first and where we got okay it's weird out this keeps doing it every time the hot module reloading happens it doesn't load all the styles that's so weird alright so now let's go back to the code we're gonna have to make a new page and next J s and I want to use one of these pages as a head start so I think these pages are pretty much the same single event single news the news page is probably what I want yeah this page has some extra stuff that I don't want to have to change that so the news page I think is more basic am i pulling in I am pulling in some stuff that I didn't add like the SEO description I don't even think I'm ended up making that text I think we're fine I'll copy this page and we use that to make our new page here so I'm gonna call this PDF page don't yes no actually okay it shouldn't matter what the name of the pages now that I think about it and maybe it will I gotta check out my server file for a second hold on okay so what I want to check is with this goes down so let me check out our events page real quick I just wanted I'm worried about what's gonna show up in the URL so I can't remember how it shows up okay so this does show up is events okay okay I see where I put it so I so I can put whatever I want right there so it doesn't even really matter what's here okay that works let me was I know it's right here PDF I guess I'll hyphenated since I was already hyphenating stuff but now that I think about it it doesn't I don't know that it makes much sense probably should have been camel casing this I think the only reason I hyphenated it was because I'm in the pages folder and normally whatever the titles here and the pages end up being URLs and in URLs you're more likely to see hyphens and not obviously not camel case so PDF pages I should say PDF page give me a single page to PDF page such as okay so now we have our PDF page and I can paste in all of this stuff and let me make sure that I really need this so I don't want posts what I want are PDF what was that PDF page we brought this over didn't we I think I'm maybe I must have moved it over again I couldn't remember I think it's just PDF page is what we put in a the API call so we're gonna filter by our ID which is actually gonna end up being the slug we're not gonna need so this is where I filter out what we actually need I don't need taxonomy x' I need content I don't need the excerpt I'm gonna keep it the ID you know actually I don't know if that I even need the ID I don't need tags or categories we're not gonna have an image any featured media all right so that's all we need this will cut out a lot of the other stuff now I need to make sure that I get rid of those things down here if I was using them so this works we don't want let's see what the information this description tag obviously we're not getting anything from the description tag because we're not pulling that in so I guess I can take it out for now just make things more simple I might put it in later on and I'm gonna pass in you don't need that now we got our error page if we need it that are sticking of we're gonna we're not gonna have an image for now we're not gonna have an image but we might add an image to just have the same image for all the info pages for now I think it'll be fine we'll just put in just kind of like a normal title so let's just do an h1 and do there's something we'll have to set it as will need to use dangerously set enter HTML because it's it's possible that sorry I just stuffed in the middle of the thought so basically it's possible that there could be characters that wouldn't show up properly if we just put this props title rendered inside the tag so that's why we do dangerous asset enter HTML because sometimes there's special characters that don't render properly or if I can just close this we'll try it out we'll see how that looks I might have to put that in its own row to make it show up better but it should work there and drops a 20 I guess has to put 0 in here okay we're getting the data I should probably use destructuring to get rid of all this but I'm not I'm not worried about it right now there's not really a lot going on okay that's good for now this will give us enough to see obviously we're gonna have to do something with the URL and have some sort of button to download the PDF but for now this will be enough to be able to see what's going on so now we need to go to the server da JS file and I'm just gonna copy and paste what's already being used here for single news and we'll change it out and say we just call that info I think it should be fine I don't it's easy to change later on if I need to as long as I don't think of too many people of link to it actually I'm a bit worried that they might think info is too informal it's kind of kind of a pretty formal type of thing type of organisation that this site's being made for I don't want to put information because they just make it unnecessarily long so how about I just put I that'll be fun I mean YouTube just has a C and their custom URLs for channels so I think that's fine I could put a P for PDF but like I said up I don't want it to be thought that this page is you know just a transition of a PDF I want the PDF to be thought of as the secondary thing the original plan well that I was told is that it was just going to be a bunch of links to PDFs but that's not really a good thing to do on the web it's it's hard you can't search through that content search engines can't see it at least all the content within so so I argued passionately against that idea and so this is this is what was agreed upon so we need to make this our PDF page per mg okay so this is gonna pass the name so we just need to make sure when we make our links the name the slug for that post is what comes after this in the well after this in the URL so this ID part needs to be the slug when we format our URLs for the about page and then everything should work so I'm gonna save that and I'm gonna make sure that I say this as well since we changed the server I need to restart it and I just need to make sure of the the slug so I don't know where I put my I'm just gonna go over to my wordpress installation here oh here we go I finally found my data here's the data I was looking for before so I just need the slug as his test page and I don't know that I was pulling in the slug no I wasn't I need to make sure well I don't need to pull it in here nevermind I don't know what I was thinking so what I need to do is use test page as our URL that's it so I should be able to go in here now and type in I slash test page and that that happened but what is going on okay I see when I copy this page this news page I hadn't copied over shoot what was it I need the side nav actually that's really weird it shouldn't be like that but it's a within nav that should be taking care of that it should should take care of the global and its side enough so I just want to make sure servers fine that's working fine the PDF page I'm 14 looks like I'm I'm not bringing in enough okay so I'm bringing in layout within layout nav should be brought in it's that that's odd am I trying to hit the side now somewhere else no this is low phase you all right so I shouldn't have to do this but I think I'm just gonna do it to see if this gets rid of the problem I mean maybe there's something that's going on because it's a parameterised route that I don't know who knows but if this fixes it and that's all I have to do then I'm happy about that you know it didn't all right so that's really odd so I want to check out and see if this is working I know I want to compare I want to compare this to our our file for single events right because the single events used to be the same as the single news and this actually is working so let's see what's different between these ones I'm gonna get rid of that that I added to the top components okay this is interesting so in the single event I'm not using the layout component so that I mean that's a really big difference Wow for the single event this is this is kind of the old way before he switched over to doing things like this I'd hate to switch back to this just to make it work but if I can't figure out what's going on then maybe I'll have to I'm gonna check the live chat just to see so basically everything is pretty much working like we wanted to we're getting it kind of an error unrelated to what the goal was having to do with the init function for the side nav okay so but at least at this point we've successfully had you know you can see the flash quickly of the content well let me let me restart this dev server so we can see it so you can quickly see the flash of content that comes up and it is the content for the page it says test page it has our lorem ipsum so that's working so I guess it's it's mission accomplished kind of for what we wanted to do now I just need to figure this out so I'm gonna go back in the live chat and see if you all have given me any ideas about the problem or if there's any questions that I can answer now since this is now already two hours in it might be a good time to just you know answer some questions and and finish up since since I've accomplished what I wanted to for this dream and then I'll just fix this before I leave today or tomorrow morning okay so we were having a discussion about fonts the units for fonts of pixels versus a.m. and Zanna says the idea is you you ever want to change your font size you just changed it once and all EMS will just use it how does anybody do you say EMS or do you say Ms I'm not really sure I've ever heard it pronounced so I don't know let me know okay so basically the pixels are won't won't respond so it's just much easier to scale your fonts up or down okay okay cool thanks Zanna sent me a link from CSS tricks so thanks thanks for sending that as more information about the whole font units discussion so anyway that's cool I mean that's pretty legit reason for using it so like I said before not sure that I'll switch right away it might be more of a gradual thing but that's pretty decent decent reason I'll just have to get an idea of like what what pixel size compares to the near the rem3 M's okay Umberto says at least from what I understand and the the the REM unit is compound the compounded scale of the font so if you have REM styles nested it will keep scaling to the most recently scaled size then Zanna says so pixels at the root REM for components and then EMS for text okay I'll definitely have to learn some more and give this some more thought before I start implementing it but it definitely seems like there's some advantages to it okay Alberto says the dev tips youtube channel has a good explanation so actually I off to watch that I really like the dev stiffs channel so if anyone wants some a good resource for learning like CSS and some more design related stuff check out the dev tips channel I the the guy who does that he doesn't do many videos anymore he got a job at Google and is just really busy so I haven't seen very many videos from him lately but his old videos are still really good and pretty relevant it's not like CSS changes that often and a lot of what he does is mostly CSS so I think they're still useful and he's pretty entertaining too easy to listen to Travis that's his name I'm pretty sure the guy from dev tips is his name is Travis okay Santa says there's this whole debate over the pixels okay so so maybe I've stepped in here into some some turbulent waters here with with this debate so I'll have to I definitely won't have time to study up on this right now because I gotta get this site it done but that'll be on the list I may have time to watch the tips video though because I could do that while I'm doing other things multitask a bit alright we had another question about the code editor Thank You Zanna for answering the question again John Hanson says innerhtml found found that out the hard way there's the special characters yeah so that was back when we were I was referencing using dangerously set innerhtml for stuff so like for the title and for the content here so it sounds like you shouldn't use it and I think I'm pretty sure at some point on a stream or something I had someone who was like a little bit upset that I was using this but my thinking is well number one like what else are you gonna do like this this comes through and there's special characters in it it gives you like the character codes and study actual characters and it's it's unreadable you can't you can't have that also as long as you control what data is coming in here which which I do then there's no reason not to use that you wouldn't just pull in random data from somewhere like you'd never want to pull in data that a user could enter you know just some random user could enter because maybe it would be you could do some malicious type of stuff with JavaScript but in this case you know this is the proper way to do it it just happens to be named this crazy name dangerously set in HTML just to warn people but if you know what you're doing then there's no reason not to use it Philip Philip B don't worry about asking the question about the editor that's it's like I totally don't mind when people ask about the editor it's just kind of like a running joke here because everybody asks about the editor so I've gotten so many questions about it that we started joking that we need to have like a chatbot and this job would would be just to say what what the editor is and like made with theme and plugins and stuff amusing so but don't don't feel bad at all I know I used to think the same when I was kind of beginning and starting out that was what I wanted to know all the time when I saw somebody's YouTube video I was always too kind of too embarrassed and shy to ask in a youtube comment so I always was like searching through the comments hoping to somebody else ask the question and then I'd be able to find out what the editor is so I totally understand the desire to know what's going on with with other people's code editors okay and then someone whose name starts with F and then there's a lot of numbers anyone want to explain exactly what he was working on so I'll try to give a really really fast summary of what I've been doing but I've been streaming for over two hours now so it's gonna be tough to sum it all up but basically I made a custom post type in WordPress with a custom field and then I exposed that data by the WordPress API I then pulled that data into a react website that was also using next jazz I use some custom routing in addition to the routing that's there by default for next G is to do what's called parameterised routing so that I can populate a like a template react jazz template based on the post slug in WordPress and do an API call to get the data from just that slug that way it doesn't matter you how many pieces of data are in there there will always be another page there will always have a nicelooking URL based on the the slug for that particular post so thanks that actually wasn't bad I thought it would take me longer to explain it so I'm not sure how how much since that made just such a quick explanation but that's basically what was done along the way we talked about some other things too but in terms of code that's what we did actually I didn't notice it Philip so Phil you just started coding yesterday so awesome welcome to coding and I'm not sure Philips in I didn't see Philip say say anything else so I hope I hope you didn't leave Philip but if you're still here welcome to coding and that's really cool that you're getting involved so right now we're at a point in the stream where we were kind of at an advanced level but every time I start a new project I'll start out with some basics so there's always going to be some basic things that even someone who's very new could probably benefit from so you know check out some of the videos like the titles of some previous live streams and you know if the title is something that interests you you know check it out there's definitely some beginner level stuff in there and I definitely don't be afraid to ask any questions and the live chat or in the comments of the videos you can even direct message me on Twitter I'd be happy to you know give you some advice if you need it John Hanson said I like how we see Jessie struggle that's how it's done I'm glad you like Amy struggle is that's what a lot of the stream is me struggling is when I'm not on the stream I don't have nearly as many issues but believe it or not I usually get a lot done and don't run into so many problems for some reason especially lately the streams have been really difficult and I've just had these like errors and stuff pop up and things just not working out which is fine it probably makes the stream a bit more entertaining and more interactive because you are trying to help me fix it if I just flew through everything and got it all done really quickly it it I don't think that would be as good for the stream it might be better for my project but not not great for this drain okay so we get some commentary here on the pronunciation so okay so we have e m we have M Janice's M's Sara's heard it at M's hey Sarah I'm not sure that I've seen you in the chat before so welcome Sarah okay so maybe I'll say m's now it seems like the the MS one out in the live chat so the the CSS unit that spelled e/m I will pronounce M from now I'll evil s about the format that the content comes through with a dangerously set innerhtml property so if you have content coming in that has HTML tags and you don't want those HTML tags to be displayed you know literally on the screen then you use dangerously set enter HTML then the HTML gets evaluated like it should by the browser you know so all your tags will work properly so it'll it'll be viewed as actual HTML content instead of just a string it's said that made you say we should we should call it live coding with Jesse and the atom editor and then no more questions we just put some text in the corner Eva says she's pathetic yeah yeah I don't know I don't mind the question I think it's kind of fun I I really I don't think I want to put it anywhere that I'm using atom editor I think it would be more fun to just see how many times people ask the question I'm not annoyed by it yet so if I ever do get annoyed maybe then I can have something in on the screen I already have something in the description for the for the videos it's it's there somewhere if you just have to read the description and Amica so sorry if i'm pronouncing that wrong it's eme ka so let me know if I'm pronouncing it wrong so a Mika says hello hey not sure I'm not sure if I've seen you in the chat before so welcome if this is your first time chatting okay so Amica want to know if the code editor does some sort of live preview or any kind of preview so by default I don't think it it uses it does a preview there's probably some sort of plugin they could do a preview so right now like I'm running a development server on my computer and it does it like reloads everything which you can't see it right now because I have this error message on the screen so it's not it's not coming from the editor but if you if you really wanted an editor that could give you a live preview just want to think of which one would do that well I know like there are some cloud editors that do that like cloud 9 is a cloud editor that does that should I think desktop I guess like Dreamweaver does that I don't know that I would recommend using Dreamweaver but there may be there's a lot of plugins I'm using Adam and there's a lot of plugins for it so maybe able to do that Sabo so SSD a bow or so SE must try to pronounce em I'm gonna say Sabo for now since you're still doing this I left the stream maybe two hours ago yeah I am still doing this sometimes the streams are quite long there's some surprise you just don't post the editor and plugins used to make the video about it in the info I did I do I have the editor I have a I'm pretty sure I have a link to the editor in the info I don't have the plugins the I showed all the plugins yesterday on the stream I keep intending to make a like a recorded video for my own youtube channel where I go through how I have Adams set up and I go through all the plugins and everything I just haven't had time to do it yet okay so the the person with lots of numbers in their name and the live chat asks can you summarize this project for me yeah I'll try to do click summary it's it's a react website that's built using next Jas which is kind of like a scaffolding tool for react that comes built in with routing and serverside rendering so it's a react site that's pulling data from a wordpress site the WordPress site has no like publicly visible face to it it's just being used as a content management system so that users who have no coding skills can put in the data easily and then that data comes into the react site it's displayed it looks nice it runs quickly that's pretty much it I mean there's not really it's pretty straightforward there's some other stuff involved like we're doing load balancing between two different node servers the WordPress installation is on a separate server so there's some some extra stuff that's going on that may be a bit beyond like just a really basic project but that's pretty much it yeah the stream will be available to watch so add a question if the stream is available so it will be available to watch usually within a few minutes after I end the stream you can watch the recording and I just saw that Patrick already answered that so thanks Patrick inside the matrix that says you should make a counter in the corner for how many times it's asked for people asking about the editor that would be really cool okay so so amicus question about editors that have a builtin preview thing so Sabo says brackets has a builtin preview that works with Chrome's a builtin plugin and Sara says Adam has one a plugin as well so awesome Thanks thanks for that information that's definitely a better answer for Annika then then I had oh and John Hanson says that Adam does have a builtin development preview so that's cool I didn't realize that the Adam theme I'm using is called the SETI theme its SETI the SETI theme inside the matrix says I use the live server plugin and Adam and Visual Studio code to see live preview okay so that's I guess you can check out that plugin so that's uh that's pretty much all for the live chat really I think I did a good job of keeping up with everything so normally I go back through the live chat and answer questions but since I kind of stopped at several points and answered questions I don't think I need to go back if I did miss your question I I'm sorry about that do you can put it in the comments for this video and I'll answer it later on or you can just direct message me on twitter my the link to my twitter is in the description for the video so i think i'm going to end because the stream has been going on for almost two and a half hours now so it's going to be a very long stream and I'll figure out what's going on with this and I'll let you all know tomorrow what the problem ended up being and that's it so if anybody has actually I got something else in the lab chest see inside the matrix's sorry I couldn't help with the air I'm not learned and react or next yet yeah oh don't worry about it yeah I'm like I'll figure it out and you all helped me so much don't ever worry about not being able to help with a problem because I've gotten so much help and so much great information from you all and in the live chat and and so much encouragement too so you all have been great actually I mentioned at the beginning of the the stream that I had submitted proposals for a talk to a bunch of conferences last night and you can if you check out a tweet I had like last night so it still should be up at the top in my Twitter you can actually there's a link to see what the presentation is but just to save you the trip the the title of the the talk I'm pretty sure I titled it something like how live coding changed my life or something like that so it's really cool and basically it's all because of you it's not it's not actually the act of coding while talking it's it's all of you it's the interaction I've had with you all and how encouraging you've been and hopefully you've been in the community that's been built up so that's really the amazing thing that I think is it's just really it's really unique you know something I've never had before I usually work alone hey see you later Zanna then asked to go so I'm saying she said goodbye in the lab chat Oh see you hopefully tomorrow you can make it for the stream so anyway that's I always kind of never really knew what I would talk about at a conference that I could talk about maybe better than other people but I think this is something because I've experienced this now in this community so so I finally have something that I think it's worth you know I could do a good job and really you know tell people something that's that could be valuable I think I did apply to do a talk about next using next Jas with an API and all kind of stuff and react but I think there's a lot of other people that could give a talk like that too and probably better than me so I'd be happy to give that talk it would be more technical but I suppose it wouldn't be quite as unique as what I could could talk about in terms of the you know the live coding yeah so Jana asked where is the talk at so I don't really know I I apply to some some talks in the United States one in in England and oh no I don't have the talk on my channel yet so I haven't you know fully like thought out everything I would say I definitely have a lot of what I would say you know kind of in my head but if I get accepted to a conference to do it then I probably you know I'll do it all I was thinking I might even do like practice as a livestream you know just kind of practice the talk and get feedback before I actually have to give it at a conference so maybe I'll do that so I don't know I've never spoken at a conference at a tech conference before and so we'll see I might not get accepted at all but I think I'll probably just keep applying you know as I see things come up just keep applying to or submitting talk ideas and maybe I'll get one and maybe we could actually think it would be really cool if I got to go somewhere that was like near where one of one of you lived and then could have like an eat up or something of you know like freak freak out camp people or something that would be kind of fun but I don't know we'll see I think there's a conference in Argentina that I'm going to apply to as well but they want you to do like a threeminute video telling why you should be there so I need to make the video first like what else where else I applied some places in Florida in the United States I think conference in New York Tennessee Washington DC so kind of like all different places but anyway I don't want to I don't want to just kind of go on and on with with talking so I'm gonna wrap this up if anybody has any advice for me in terms of trying to get accepted into conferences that would be really awesome even if you just want to check out that link on Twitter to what I said to try to get in the conference I mean if you if you have any advice you know for just kind of the way I presented my idea about how I could do it better I'd really appreciate that cuz I don't know I think it would be really cool to share that like what's going on here with our little community with with more people I think it'd be really really helpful if like more people did did things like this so anyway is that's it that's all I got for today oh I'll be back tomorrow at 2 p.m. Eastern time and and until then have a great day see y'all tomorrow
