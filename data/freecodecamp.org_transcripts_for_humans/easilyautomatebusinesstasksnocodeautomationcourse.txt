00:25 - this course possible have you ever
00:27 - wanted to learn how to automate tasks in
00:29 - your business so that you can free up
00:31 - time to take on the bigger challenges my
00:34 - name is Ana Kubo and I'm a software
00:35 - developer as well as course creator here
00:37 - on free cocam as well as on my own
00:39 - channel and I'm going to be your guide
00:41 - today into learning all about Automation
00:44 - and how to do so now usually you might
00:46 - see coding tutorials from me but this
00:48 - course is for everyone meaning that no
00:51 - code will be required this makes this
00:53 - course perfect for anyone from Founders
00:56 - marketers sales reps or operational
00:58 - gurus I'll be showing you how to make
01:01 - automation pipelines ranging from simple
01:03 - to Advanced we will also have all of
01:06 - these application Integrations to our
01:08 - disposal so as you can see there's a lot
01:11 - and if you have your own app you can
01:14 - also hook it up as well for the purpose
01:16 - of this course we will focus on a
01:18 - variety of verticals to try cover as
01:21 - many interest R views as possible in
01:23 - fact here's a breakdown of what we will
01:24 - be building in this course so first off
01:27 - I'm just going to start with an
01:28 - introduction in which I'm I'm going to
01:30 - introduce you to make.com which is where
01:33 - the no code automation tool that we will
01:35 - be using lives after getting to grips
01:39 - with it through a short tutorial I will
01:41 - then move on into talking about lead
01:44 - management Automation in this section I
01:47 - will start off with a use case for this
01:49 - automation so that you can get to groups
01:51 - with what you can do with it after
01:54 - understanding how lead management
01:56 - automation can be useful for you or your
01:59 - company I will then go into building our
02:01 - first automation pipeline which is a
02:04 - basic one that will essentially take
02:06 - your Facebook leads from a Facebook
02:09 - adver and put them into a Google sheet
02:12 - for you next we will move on to a more
02:15 - advanced automation pipeline in which we
02:18 - will collect contacts that have come to
02:21 - you from a form on your company website
02:24 - we will then take the lead's email
02:26 - analyze the domain it came from through
02:29 - a company called clearbit which will
02:31 - give us information about the domain
02:33 - name so for example if bobbyg google.com
02:37 - is messaging you from his work email we
02:40 - know that he works at Google and
02:42 - clearbit will allow us to get all this
02:43 - information about Google that will be
02:45 - useful to us after getting this
02:48 - information we will move on to put this
02:50 - in a CRM system and filter it based on
02:54 - the cloud score of the company itself
02:57 - and as a bonus we'll send a message to
02:59 - Slack to all our colleagues to let us
03:01 - know that a new lead has come in after
03:03 - that we'll move on to look at e-commerce
03:05 - automation starting off once again with
03:07 - a use case for this and leading into
03:10 - building an automation pipeline this one
03:13 - will take on the premise of you being a
03:15 - property company and having loads and
03:17 - loads of properties in a Google sheet
03:20 - and using chat GPT to essentially create
03:23 - a description of all of your properties
03:25 - that you can use online we will also add
03:28 - extra information about the property and
03:30 - its whereabouts thanks to providing the
03:32 - exact location of the property so that
03:34 - we can also include familiar landmarks
03:37 - and Metro stations in the vicinity next
03:40 - we will look at a ticketing and barcode
03:42 - automation which will use the barcode
03:45 - app from make.com so that you can
03:48 - essentially once again use a Google
03:50 - spreadsheet of all the tickets that you
03:52 - sold and generate individual barcodes
03:56 - for them which we will then stick into a
03:58 - template make on Google Docs so you can
04:01 - automatically create a unique ticket
04:04 - with a barcode for all of your ticket
04:06 - purchases after this we will move on to
04:08 - an in-house automation so far we've been
04:12 - creating automations that help us either
04:14 - get new clients or work with existing
04:16 - clients outside of our company well I'm
04:19 - going to show you how to create an
04:20 - automation that will help you deal with
04:22 - the admin internally too so for this
04:25 - example I'm going to show you how you
04:26 - can automatically create Google calendar
04:29 - events from Trello as well as go into a
04:32 - use case for why this might be useful
04:34 - and finally we will end with an
04:36 - automation that tells more into AI this
04:39 - is a fantastic one I don't want to
04:41 - reveal too much but essentially it's
04:43 - going to use chat GPT or another words
04:46 - the open AI API in order to produce
04:50 - unique and very real responses to emails
04:54 - of a certain category okay so make sure
04:58 - to stay tuned for that one at the end
05:01 - we'll be doing so using mate.com as our
05:04 - no code automation tool in order to
05:06 - build out our automation pipelines to
05:09 - follow along with this tutorial you can
05:11 - use the link in the video description
05:13 - below to create a make.com account with
05:15 - a higher level of access than normal
05:17 - just go ahead and click on it now and
05:19 - let's get going so what are we waiting
05:22 - for let's do it first off I'm going to
05:25 - show you how to get started with the
05:27 - automation tool that we'll be using
05:29 - today
05:33 - okay so we're going to start off on the
05:34 - make.com website and we're going to get
05:36 - started for free so just go ahead and
05:39 - click here you won't be asked for any
05:41 - payment and I'm just going to choose to
05:43 - sign up with Google you can of course
05:46 - choose to sign up however you wish
05:48 - there's an option to sign in with
05:49 - Facebook GitHub and of course just using
05:52 - your name and email so there you go just
05:56 - choose the one you prefer agree to the
05:59 - terms of
06:00 - service this part is optional you can
06:03 - choose to sign up to notifications and
06:06 - emails if you wish about the latest and
06:08 - I'm just going to sign up for free after
06:11 - checking that I am not a robot and there
06:14 - we go so great first off I'm just going
06:17 - to select the role which best describes
06:19 - me I'm going to choose development and
06:21 - engineering and then what do I want to
06:24 - automate well we're going to be
06:25 - automating a bunch of things however we
06:28 - are going to start with lead management
06:29 - first so I'm just going to select that
06:31 - one and let's start with having no
06:33 - experience at all the company size is
06:36 - just me and then I'm just going to
06:38 - select YouTube as the way I heard this
06:41 - and great so now let's get started so
06:45 - here we are we are now on the dashboard
06:47 - that's going to allow us to create a lot
06:49 - of
06:50 - scenarios in regards to automations and
06:53 - allow us to run them you can of course
06:56 - upgrade if you wish our current plan is
06:59 - the free plan it will just allow us to
07:02 - have more operations build more apps
07:04 - have an unlimited number of scenarios 40
07:07 - minutes of scenario execution time we
07:09 - can also increase the file size that we
07:12 - work with and then also have access to
07:14 - 300 API endpoints as well it's only $9 a
07:19 - month so please go ahead and sign up to
07:22 - that one if you want or you even have
07:23 - the pro version which elaborates on the
07:26 - plan before as was a team version also
07:29 - Enterprise version as well so those are
07:32 - the options you have like I said we are
07:35 - going to be working with the free
07:36 - package don't worry we want to go over
07:38 - the maximum amount of active scenarios
07:41 - that we're going to build
07:44 - great so let's go
07:47 - back we currently have no active
07:49 - scenarios however we are going to build
07:52 - them out and we're going to do so soon
07:54 - we are also able to create a team so I'm
07:57 - not going to be doing this for this
07:59 - tutorial but when you grow your
08:00 - organization so that you know you add
08:03 - more team members you would create a
08:04 - team first and then you can also add
08:07 - users to that so like I said I'm the
08:09 - only user here at the moment you can
08:11 - invite other users to your organization
08:14 - but that is something that we will not
08:16 - be doing in this
08:18 - course
08:21 - wonderful let's continue now let's
08:24 - create our first scenario and to do that
08:26 - we can actually click this button right
08:28 - here and here we are we are now ready to
08:31 - create our first
08:35 - scenario when working for yourself or a
08:38 - small to medium-sized business
08:40 - automating the first interaction to a
08:42 - potential customer or client can be a
08:44 - huge resource saver by this I imagine
08:47 - Stella and her team are looking to
08:48 - spread the word about a new tool that is
08:50 - useful to software developers she
08:52 - advertises on Facebook or LinkedIn to
08:55 - collect leads to see who is actually
08:57 - interested in the tool St can then
09:00 - automate a message or even a custom
09:02 - message if she wants to the hundreds and
09:04 - hundreds of leads or even have chat GPT
09:07 - WR them for her this would happen in
09:09 - seconds as opposed to days if she chose
09:11 - to type out the messages herself and not
09:14 - only that she can automate the admin for
09:16 - organizing these companies within her
09:18 - company too whether she's using Google
09:20 - Sheets or a CRM like HubSpot there is so
09:24 - so much more she can do I'm going to
09:26 - show you a few of these things now
09:31 - okay so let's get building Facebook
09:33 - leads ads are one of the most popular
09:35 - and important ad products that companies
09:38 - can lean on today by leveraging the
09:40 - mobile friendliness and advanced
09:41 - targeting features Facebook leads ads
09:44 - provide both small businesses and large
09:46 - companies can connect with their
09:47 - audiences to give them the information
09:50 - they want and generate qualified leads
09:52 - all at once Facebook leads are CAU
09:55 - through forms so form submissions on
09:57 - Facebook and in order to get those we're
10:00 - going to have to actually create that
10:02 - form on Facebook through their ads
10:04 - account with an active campaign driving
10:06 - our audience to the lead forms let's
10:09 - have a go at doing that now so all I'm
10:12 - going to do is head over to the ads
10:15 - account so ads manager account for my
10:17 - business account it should be under the
10:19 - URL ads manager. facebook.com ads
10:23 - manager okay and if you hit enter it
10:26 - should take you to the fourth thing
10:30 - now I'm just going to create a campaign
10:33 - and it's going to be for leads and I'm
10:35 - just going to click
10:37 - continue okay so here we go we have a
10:39 - new leads campaign I can choose what
10:42 - this will advertise as I run code with
10:44 - anna.com I'm selling courses on there so
10:48 - I'm going to go with employment as my
10:50 - course will help you get employed as a
10:52 - software developer the country I've
10:54 - chosen is United Kingdom and you can
10:57 - choose to add all these things I'm just
10:59 - going to keep it super basic for now and
11:02 - click next great we want to generate
11:05 - leads by asking people to fill in a form
11:08 - using instant forms so that is the
11:11 - option that I'm going to
11:13 - choose make sure to agree to the terms
11:16 - and conditions just like so and once
11:19 - you've accepted the meta leads adds
11:21 - terms for this page you should be good
11:22 - to go great I'm going to maximize for
11:26 - number of
11:28 - leads the these are all optionals so I'm
11:31 - just going to also set a budget and
11:34 - schedule like
11:36 - so I'm not going to set an end date
11:39 - again these are all up to you I'm just
11:41 - going to leave everything very basic
11:43 - like this
11:46 - wonderful now you must select an
11:48 - Instagram page for this to work on I'm
11:50 - just going to choose my Instagram
11:58 - account
12:01 - and I'm going to choose a template for
12:03 - us to work with as once again I'm just
12:05 - going to keep this very very basic so
12:08 - we're just going to collect quick and
12:10 - easy information including the contact
12:13 - information of the person so the full
12:15 - name the email address and the phone
12:17 - number so that we can contact them you
12:20 - can customize it if you wish so for
12:23 - example maybe let's change the full name
12:25 - to code with Ana
12:30 - leads and the form type you can also
12:34 - customize your form depending on the
12:35 - goal of your lead generation campaign
12:38 - again we are not doing a Facebook
12:41 - tutorial so I'm just going to keep this
12:43 - very basic and create the form and then
12:45 - we're also going to add a link it's
12:47 - going to be to code with anna.com this
12:51 - is because a privacy policy exists on
12:53 - code withth anna.com okay so if you go
12:57 - to the actual website and scroll down
13:00 - you will see a bunch of legal stuff
13:02 - right here so make sure to have that too
13:05 - great we're also going to have to add a
13:08 - link here this is simply to my website
13:12 - so the call to action is to view the
13:14 - website as well and this is after our
13:16 - form is submitted so let's create the
13:20 - form wonderful another thing we can do
13:23 - is just change the visuals on this which
13:25 - might be a nice thing to do so let's go
13:28 - ahead and
14:29 - strategy when creating your own okay
14:32 - great so this is looking good I can also
14:34 - choose to review the
14:38 - advert this will take you to a form on
14:41 - Facebook which is exactly what we want
14:44 - we want the form to be filled out and
14:47 - captured by Facebook which we will then
14:49 - learn to manage elsewhere soon but this
14:52 - is looking good for me so I'm just going
14:53 - to hit on publish and wonderful that is
14:57 - now publishing my advert my form capture
15:01 - advert and that's now been published it
15:04 - is currently processing so we're going
15:05 - to have to check back to see what this
15:07 - looks like soon for now let's continue
15:10 - making our scenario so now as you can
15:13 - see here I'm going to go back to
15:15 - make.com and let's continue so the first
15:19 - thing I'm going to do is choose a
15:20 - trigger that will kick off our scenario
15:22 - that trigger is going to be the Facebook
15:24 - lead next we're going to choose an
15:27 - action that will follow after the
15:28 - trigger and then following that we're
15:30 - going to decide where we want our
15:32 - Facebook leads to go to I'm going to
15:34 - choose a Google spreadsheet and then
15:36 - we'll test our scenario and choose to
15:38 - activate it if we wish so let's do it so
15:42 - I'm just going to click here and then
15:43 - we're going to search for Facebook just
15:46 - like so and we're going to select
15:47 - Facebook leads ads okay and we're going
15:51 - to set the trigger as being a new lead
15:54 - so it will trigger when a new lead is
15:56 - created great now we're going to going
15:59 - to create a web hook so we're just going
16:01 - to click on create web hook and we can
16:03 - keep it as it is or you can change it if
16:06 - you wish and we're going to create a
16:08 - connection so that is now making a
16:11 - connection from my Facebook to make this
16:14 - may take a while because some Partners
16:16 - may take a while to reflect this change
16:19 - so let's go ahead and click save and
16:21 - then this should take me to this popup
16:24 - you might have to allow popups if you're
16:26 - not seeing this and I'm going to
16:29 - continuous Ana so my Facebook login as
16:32 - you saw we're already logged into
16:34 - Facebook which is why this is showing up
16:36 - as so and I'm going to allow access to
16:39 - be made from make to Facebook great so
16:43 - now that's waiting for authorization and
16:45 - wonderful I'm now going to select the
16:47 - page I want to connect to and it is code
16:49 - with Anna so that is looking good the
16:52 - form it is code with Ana leads as we
16:55 - named it in the ads manager and I'm just
16:58 - going to click save
17:00 - great I'm actually going to go ahead and
17:02 - select all the fields like so and click
17:05 - okay great so our trigger is now chosen
17:09 - let's continue so now I'm just going to
17:12 - head over to Facebook and we just need
17:14 - to allow access to people so I'm going
17:18 - to select on myself and all I'm going to
17:20 - do is essentially select the pages and
17:23 - I'm going to allow myself access to
17:25 - manage leads including download leads
17:27 - and create leads as and more and save so
17:30 - just make sure to essentially do the
17:33 - same okay wonderful so once that is done
17:38 - let's go back in here and now I'm just
17:41 - going to run this and the scenario run
17:44 - was complete so some data has come back
17:46 - we now need to put it in a Google sheet
17:48 - so let's go ahead and find Google Sheets
17:51 - I'm just going to select that module and
17:53 - we want to essentially add a row so I'm
17:57 - just going to drag that over and connect
17:59 - it and create a connection I'm going to
18:01 - leave this as my Google connection of
18:03 - course you can call it whatever you wish
18:06 - and I'm just going to sign in with
18:08 - Google so that we can connect to Google
18:10 - Sheets I'm of course going to select
18:13 - Anna Codi an.com as that is the Google
18:16 - account that I want to give access to
18:18 - make to and once again I'm allowing make
18:21 - to see edit create and delete all my
18:23 - Google Drive files as well as see and
18:25 - edit create and delete all my Google
18:27 - Sheets spreadsheets so just go ahead and
18:30 - do the same if you're of course
18:32 - comfortable with that so I'm going to
18:34 - click allow and great we've created a
18:38 - connection now we need to actually go
18:40 - ahead and create that Google sheet so
18:43 - let's go ahead and go to Google Sheets
18:47 - and all I'm going to do is essentially
18:49 - create a blank spreadsheet so let's go
18:51 - ahead and click here and then I'm just
18:54 - going to name this something let's go
18:56 - ahead and call this Facebook leads you
18:58 - can call it or whatever you want and we
19:00 - also need to name the sheet as we will
19:01 - be picking that out so I've named it
19:03 - leads and then we're going to choose the
19:06 - method to be the same and the drive well
19:08 - it's going to be my drive and here I'm
19:10 - just going to find that spreadsheet so
19:12 - let's go ahead and search for Facebook
19:14 - leads and of course select the sheet so
19:18 - the sheet name will be generated for you
19:20 - we only have one so let's go ahead and
19:22 - select leads just like we have named it
19:25 - here so there we go I'm going to keep
19:29 - table headers as no as we don't have any
19:32 - and the column range I'm just going to
19:33 - go A to Z as we won't have many and here
19:36 - we're just going to pick out everything
19:38 - from the object that we want because we
19:40 - round this once the object does have
19:43 - some values so this is great for us as
19:46 - we know what's coming back so I'm going
19:48 - to go ahead and select a few of course
19:50 - we should probably have the lead ID so
19:55 - I'm going to go ahead and select that
19:57 - I'm going to also select the form ID uh
19:59 - I'm also going to select the full name
20:02 - of the person who has emailed in as well
20:05 - as the email and we can have whatever we
20:07 - want as I said I'm just going to stick
20:09 - phone number in there too and let's go
20:12 - ahead and choose is organic that's
20:15 - another one that I want and let's have
20:17 - the ad name and let's also have the
20:19 - campaign ID and that's
20:22 - it okay so now let's run this however
20:25 - because it might be slightly difficult
20:27 - for us to ass essentially you know fake
20:30 - someone signing up to our form right now
20:33 - and getting a lead what I am going to do
20:36 - is actually choose where to start this
20:39 - so what I'm going to do is just right
20:41 - click on here choose where to start and
20:44 - I'm just going to do all so all of all
20:46 - time all my leads of all time of this
20:49 - campaign this very short campaign are
20:51 - going to be caught so now let's run this
20:55 - and amazing so that has now worked and
20:58 - if we look in here we indeed get the
21:01 - leads so there we go you can add a
21:05 - header of course so it's more obvious
21:07 - what these fields mean so I would
21:09 - suggest doing that because you know
21:11 - otherwise this information can be quite
21:14 - confusing to someone who didn't set up
21:16 - the automation themselves as we just did
21:19 - because of course we know what all of
21:21 - these columns are for so again I would
21:24 - suggest doing that but you can do that
21:27 - by yourself I hope you you found this
21:29 - useful I certainly did and this is
21:32 - certainly something that I will be using
21:34 - for my own
21:42 - business okay so let's go ahead and
21:44 - create this automation I'm going to go
21:47 - ahead and create a new scenario and
21:50 - first off we're going to use a web hook
21:53 - and this web Hook is essentially going
21:55 - to listen out for interactions on a live
21:59 - website that website is going to be one
22:01 - I have previously made using wix.com
22:05 - okay and it's a website for Real Estate
22:08 - it is a real company and I'm going to be
22:10 - using the contact form in order to
22:13 - trigger something happening so let's do
22:16 - it let's go over to the website that I
22:19 - have previously made this is the website
22:22 - again it's just one for managing Airbnb
22:25 - Properties or for renting long-term ass
22:28 - short term or if you have a property you
22:30 - want to manage this should cover it and
22:33 - here is the contact form okay so we're
22:35 - pretending to be this company it is a
22:38 - live company that has launched on thre
22:40 - hogan.com and we essentially want to
22:43 - collect leads straight to a CRM system
22:47 - so what's going to happen is a contact
22:49 - is going to leave a message for us so
22:53 - for example Dany who works at Google
22:56 - would fill this out and this would
22:58 - trigger our web hook which will then
23:01 - trigger clear bit another module we'll
23:03 - be using in order to essentially get
23:05 - information about the company that that
23:08 - client is emailing from so for example
23:10 - if the client used the email address
23:13 - with the domain google.com obviously
23:15 - Google is a big company so there's going
23:17 - to be a lot of online data on this
23:20 - clearbit will find out all the
23:21 - information about that company so in
23:24 - other words Google and then we will also
23:26 - filter out the data and put that lead
23:29 - into HubSpot so our CRM system so that
23:33 - the three Hogan staff can essentially
23:35 - manage it from there and we can even
23:37 - send off messages to a slack Channel if
23:40 - we wish okay so let's do it I'm going to
23:44 - pretend I am the developer working for
23:46 - three hogan.com
23:47 - and I'm going to need wix's access so
23:50 - let's go ahead and head over to Wix Wix
23:54 - is just a website builder that I use to
23:56 - create this website so if you want to
23:59 - use it please go ahead just make sure to
24:01 - actually have your site live so just
24:06 - like this one right here that is
24:07 - important for this tutorial okay so here
24:12 - is what it looks like behind the scenes
24:14 - we can edit the website like
24:17 - so and I'm just going to scroll all the
24:20 - way down to the bottom where the contact
24:22 - form lives so here it is you can simply
24:26 - add your own if you don't have one by
24:29 - going to contact forms and dragging one
24:32 - over okay so for example we can put in
24:35 - another one if we wish just like this
24:39 - okay however we're not going to do this
24:41 - I'm just going to delete that because we
24:43 - already have one here so making sure the
24:46 - Wix form is selected I would simply go
24:49 - to form
24:50 - settings and we're going to head over to
24:54 - automations so just click on that and
24:58 - view your automations so this should
25:00 - take you to this dashboard we give view
25:02 - any automations that exist and now we're
25:05 - just going to scroll down and we're
25:08 - going to create an automation so go
25:10 - ahead and click create automation these
25:13 - are the popular ones however we are
25:15 - going to start from scratch so just make
25:17 - sure to click start from
25:20 - scratch and we're going to choose an app
25:23 - to trigger so that is the Wix form as we
25:27 - saw
25:29 - here Wix form so let's go ahead and
25:32 - select the Wix form now I'm going to
25:36 - select the trigger on when the form is
25:37 - submitted not for when a choice has been
25:40 - selected on a form and we can choose
25:43 - which form to trigger this automation so
25:46 - I'm going to be specific and say it's
25:49 - the contact form that I want to
25:53 - essentially trigger this
25:55 - automation so if someone submits a form
25:58 - on the contact form this should happen
26:01 - and I don't want to limit the
26:04 - frequency and once that is done we're
26:06 - just going to send via webbook so that's
26:09 - what we need and next we just need a
26:11 - Target URL and we're going to send all
26:14 - the keys and values okay you can see the
26:16 - structure here of what we will send over
26:19 - or in other words what we want to send
26:20 - over to our web hook okay so let's go
26:25 - ahead and do it let's create our web
26:26 - hook so I'm just going to search for web
26:28 - hooks from the
26:32 - dropdown there we go and we're going to
26:34 - create a custom web hook so make sure to
26:36 - select custom web hook that triggers
26:38 - when web hook receives data and now
26:41 - we're going to essentially create a hook
26:44 - so let's go ahead and select that you
26:47 - can choose to name this whatever you
26:49 - wish I'm just going to leave it the
26:50 - generic title that it gave me we're not
26:53 - going to put in any IP restrictions okay
26:56 - or essentially leave it empty if you
26:58 - don't want to check the IP address and
27:00 - I'm just going to hit save so great so
27:03 - this is the target URL we need I'm just
27:05 - going to copy all of that or you can
27:08 - copy the address to clipboard and now
27:11 - let's go back to our automations and put
27:13 - in the Target URL like so okay so
27:16 - essentially we're going to be sending
27:17 - that form data to this URL or in other
27:20 - words sending it over to our web hook
27:22 - which lives on make.com and let's just
27:25 - activate this great we can give this
27:28 - name I'm just going to call this leads
27:29 - and save it so that we know which web
27:33 - hook we just created and there we go
27:36 - there is our web hook you can also view
27:38 - a summary at the moment there would have
27:40 - been zero triggers but of course we're
27:42 - going to trigger that now so let's do it
27:46 - so let's go back to our form I'm just
27:49 - going to clear any caches in case there
27:52 - is some old data here so clear browsing
27:56 - data clear data
27:59 - and let's go back and let's just go
28:01 - ahead with
28:02 - Bobby last name Brown email is
28:07 - bobbyg google.com so Bobby works at
28:10 - Google and he's using his work email
28:13 - essentially which is why it's got the at
28:14 - Google domain here and then we're just
28:18 - going to put
28:21 - hello Hogan Holiday Homes I am looking
28:27 - to rent a two bed for one
28:32 - month okay so that is the message that
28:34 - we're going to send and I'm just going
28:36 - to hit submit okay it says thanks for
28:39 - submitting so we have sent that over
28:42 - let's check if it worked so if we go
28:44 - back
28:46 - here and great that has been
28:48 - successfully determined that is working
28:51 - so let's click okay if you also want to
28:54 - check you can go back to your
28:56 - automations on wix and you can view the
28:59 - summary and you should see that it has
29:01 - been triggered a total of one times
29:04 - that's correct because we did send over
29:07 - a form submit just once so this is
29:10 - looking good everything is aligned so
29:14 - great we can get rid of this
29:16 - now wonderful so now that we have our
29:20 - web hook hooked up as send you to our
29:23 - form on three hogan.com I now need to
29:26 - send that form data so in other words
29:29 - Bobby his first name his last name and
29:32 - his email address so bobbyg google.com
29:35 - over to clear bit so we can analyze
29:38 - essentially the domain name from which
29:40 - this was sent from so I'm going to add
29:42 - another module and I'm going to search
29:44 - for clearbit Okay so clearbit is here
29:48 - and we're going to essentially get a
29:50 - company so great but of course we first
29:53 - need to establish a connection so clear
29:56 - bit essentially
29:58 - looks like this it is a great B2B data
30:01 - platform that you can sign up to that
30:05 - essentially gives you information on
30:07 - companies like I just said so you can
30:09 - get a lot about a company and the data
30:12 - you can get I'm going to show you so
30:15 - first up we just need to essentially
30:17 - sign up to this so I'm just going to go
30:20 - ahead and log in you do need to sign in
30:24 - with HubSpot so if you don't have a
30:26 - HubSpot account please go ahead and sign
30:29 - up to one so HubSpot is again the CRM
30:32 - system that we will be using today and
30:35 - once again you can just sign up or get
30:38 - started for free I already have a
30:40 - HubSpot account so I'm just going to log
30:42 - in I'm going to sign in with
30:46 - Google and here we are okay this is
30:49 - essentially my account I've just kind of
30:52 - put in my company details such as you
30:54 - know the company name is three Hogan and
30:57 - I have my username and password and so
30:59 - on and essentially what we want to be
31:01 - doing is adding contacts to the contacts
31:04 - lick here at the moment there is no
31:07 - contacts okay but that is something that
31:09 - we're going to add so once you've signed
31:12 - up for hopspot you going to go back to
31:15 - clear bit and sign in with HubSpot so
31:18 - I'm just going to go ahead and click
31:21 - that and this is connecting clearit to
31:24 - HubSpot I'm going to choose the account
31:26 - like I said the account is three Hogan
31:28 - cuz that is the one that I just created
31:29 - on hopspot I'm going to choose the
31:34 - account
31:36 - and I'm going to click okay and great so
31:41 - like I said this is just linked to my
31:43 - hopspot account and now what I need to
31:46 - do is essentially connect clear bit to
31:49 - here so let's create a connection I'm
31:52 - going to just leave this as my clear bit
31:54 - connection and it needs an API key so
31:56 - I'm going to show you how to find this
31:58 - so the API key well it's actually taken
32:01 - from the clearbit API
32:04 - documentation so I'm just going to go to
32:07 - dashboard. cit.com
32:10 - slocs in order to get essentially my API
32:14 - key so let's do it I'm just going to
32:18 - scroll down authentication is done via
32:20 - your account API key which is and this
32:22 - is unique to me so I'm going to copy
32:25 - this okay if you need need to see your
32:28 - API Keys just go to the dashboard here
32:32 - and here again is your secret API key so
32:35 - if you need to change it or get it a
32:36 - vote please do contact clear bit okay
32:39 - because you want to keep that safe so
32:41 - now let's go ahead and whack that in
32:43 - like so and save so now in here we just
32:47 - need to feed in whatever company we
32:50 - essentially want to get more information
32:53 - about and in order to do that well we're
32:56 - going to use the data from the web hook
32:58 - correct and I'm going to use the email
33:02 - address so under
33:05 - the contact I'm going to get the email
33:09 - okay so this should come back with
33:11 - essentially Bobby at google.com correct
33:15 - but we just want the google.com part so
33:19 - I'm going to essentially write a
33:21 - function for this I'm going to use get
33:24 - open up my parenthesis I'm going to do
33:26 - split open up my parenthesis again wrap
33:30 - this in parenthesis twice but right
33:33 - before this one I'm going to use a
33:37 - semicolon at and then after the second
33:40 - one I'm going to do semicolon 2 okay so
33:44 - this is let you split out the domain
33:47 - name from the email address so anything
33:49 - after the at sign will get put into here
33:53 - okay
33:55 - wonderful great and that's really it so
33:58 - I'm just going to click okay and let's
34:00 - go ahead and essentially run this so now
34:03 - once again this is waiting for the data
34:06 - right so let's go here and this time I'm
34:09 - going to put
34:10 - Sandra
34:12 - Sue email
34:14 - Sandra
34:17 - google.com hello I have a
34:21 - property I would like you to
34:26 - manage and
34:31 - submit okay so that data was finally
34:34 - sent over and the scenario was finalized
34:37 - and the scenario run was completed so if
34:39 - you click on here you will see the data
34:42 - that comes back from clearbit okay so
34:44 - once again this data is simply Sandra's
34:47 - information okay we have Sandra woo so
34:52 - under here we have a lot of context we
34:56 - just want essentially the contact so the
34:59 - name Sandra Sue the email is Sandra
35:04 - google.com correct and a bunch of
35:06 - information we even get over the message
35:08 - if we need it and here of course we've
35:11 - split out
35:12 - google.com from the email address
35:15 - correct and this is the output so
35:18 - essentially we have the legal name of
35:20 - Google which is Google LLC we also have
35:23 - the domain name and we also have the
35:26 - aliases so all the aliases that Google
35:28 - owns this is pretty cool information all
35:31 - the sites and phone numbers and emails
35:34 - attached to it which at the moment for
35:36 - google.com is none a description of the
35:40 - company the year it was founded the
35:43 - location the time zone even which we
35:45 - will be using it's logo Facebook handle
35:50 - I mean this information is just
35:52 - incredible so let's go ahead and use it
35:55 - right and we are going to use it in
35:57 - order to create
35:58 - Roots so once again I'm just going to
36:01 - shut down clear bit I'm going to shut
36:03 - down clear bit here and shut down Hobs
36:05 - spot we're going to keep three hogan.com
36:07 - and let's continue so let's add another
36:12 - module and I'm just going to add a
36:16 - router so under flow control we can
36:19 - select router like so and it will split
36:22 - off in order to create two Roots however
36:25 - we're going to add another one so so
36:27 - let's just go ahead and click on it
36:29 - again and three Roots will now appear so
36:33 - essentially what these roots are going
36:34 - to help me do are filter out the data
36:37 - that comes back from Clear bit about the
36:39 - company and we are going to do that by
36:42 - writing specific conditions that must be
36:44 - met in order for the data to pass
36:47 - through so if I go ahead and click on
36:51 - here we can set up a filter in order to
36:53 - do that so I'm going to call this filter
36:59 - continent
37:01 - equals
37:03 - America let's say the employee count of
37:06 - the company has to be larger than 100
37:10 - and category we are going to put as
37:14 - software okay just as a reminder of what
37:17 - this route is all about because that is
37:19 - essentially the filter we're going to
37:21 - set up so in other words we want the
37:25 - company to be based in America to have
37:27 - an employee count of over 100 and for
37:30 - the company category to be software for
37:33 - example okay so perhaps as a property
37:36 - company we want to Target people in
37:39 - America that work for a company that has
37:42 - over 100 employees so they have a lot of
37:44 - income and maybe even work in software
37:47 - as that is a high income field this is
37:50 - just an example of course so let's go
37:53 - ahead and write a condition so for that
37:56 - I can for example choose a time zone and
37:59 - I can choose contains and make it case
38:02 - insensitive and if I put America this
38:05 - means that if the company that comes
38:07 - back from Clear bit contains the
38:10 - continent of America as the time zone so
38:13 - as you can see here from the one we just
38:16 - received Google under time zone it does
38:19 - contain America it also has Los andeles
38:22 - in there but because we're using the
38:23 - operative contains it's just going to
38:25 - pick out America and allow it through
38:28 - this filter great so that is one
38:31 - condition but let's create the others so
38:33 - I'm going to use the and and Rule and
38:37 - here let's work on the employees so what
38:41 - I'm going to do this time is Select
38:44 - employees because I know that's
38:45 - something that comes back from clearbit
38:47 - which is a great stat to have so let's
38:50 - just go ahead and find that metric here
38:53 - so under metrics we can find the
38:56 - employees so just going to select that
39:00 - you can use maybe market cap you can use
39:02 - annual revenue instead it really is up
39:05 - to you and I'm going to use a text
39:07 - operator of greater than okay and I'm
39:10 - just going to stick 100 so that's our
39:13 - second condition of course Google meets
39:15 - both of these it's in America and it's
39:18 - definitely got over 100 employees so
39:21 - let's create the third now the third
39:24 - criteria that I wanted to pass or in
39:26 - other words the final condition is the
39:29 - industry so let's go ahead and select
39:32 - category
39:33 - industry and we're going to have it
39:37 - contain case
39:40 - insensitive software right so let's go
39:43 - ahead and find contains case insensitive
39:47 - software so this just means that even
39:49 - though software is spelled with a
39:51 - capital S here and a small s here it
39:54 - doesn't matter it will still get
39:56 - filtered through so great those are my
39:59 - three conditions so wonderful let's see
40:02 - if this works let's see if the filter
40:04 - catches it so once again I'm just going
40:06 - to run this and of course we need to
40:09 - submit a form so this time let's put
40:14 - zavier
40:16 - zoo zavier
40:19 - at
40:21 - google.com hey do you have any
40:26 - shortterm rentals in
40:30 - Dubai and hit submit okay so amazing
40:35 - that should get picked up and it does so
40:39 - if you zoom in here continent equals
40:41 - America employees over 100 category
40:43 - equal software that's just the label we
40:45 - gave this router and let's now send it
40:48 - somewhere and we're going to send it to
40:50 - HubSpot so let's go ahead and search for
40:54 - HubSpot I'm going to search for HubSpot
40:56 - CR M and we are just going to
41:00 - essentially create a contact so let's
41:03 - search for create a contact I'm going to
41:05 - select that wonderful and let's create a
41:07 - connection so I'm just going to select
41:10 - this right here I'm going to choose to
41:12 - leave this as my HubSpot CRM connection
41:15 - and hit save and now it's just going to
41:18 - take me to log into HubSpot so
41:21 - contacting HubSpot from make so it's
41:24 - trying to make a connection we're going
41:25 - to choose the account so it is through
41:27 - Hogan that is the account that we made
41:29 - for our HubSpot account I'm going to
41:31 - choose the
41:34 - account and I'm just going to allow make
41:37 - to manage and view our CRM data and
41:40 - we're just going to tick on here to
41:42 - accept those terms and conditions and
41:44 - we're going to connect the
41:46 - app okay
41:49 - wonderful so that's waiting for
41:51 - authorization and that's now done we're
41:54 - going to now leave the view method has
41:57 - come back and we're going to add the
41:58 - properties because we're essentially
42:00 - going to get that information that comes
42:02 - back from Clear bit and also comes back
42:05 - from the web hook in order to put it in
42:08 - the CRM system so let's go ahead and add
42:11 - this and I'm just going to put the key
42:14 - as let's go with first name and the
42:16 - value of this we're going to not get
42:19 - back from Clear bit but let's get it
42:20 - from the web hog so from the form
42:23 - submission so let's go under contact
42:26 - let's go under name and I'm just going
42:27 - to select the first name great let's add
42:31 - another one so this time also I'm just
42:33 - going to select the last name so let's
42:36 - go with this and once again I'm just
42:39 - going to from the web HW get the contact
42:42 - name last name and there we go let's add
42:46 - another one so we've got the first name
42:48 - we've got the last name being saved on
42:49 - the hotspot we have also all of these
42:52 - other properties to our disposal so it
42:55 - really is up to us whatever we want to
42:59 - choose let's go ahead and put the
43:01 - company name okay so this time I'm going
43:03 - to get this from Clear bit let's get the
43:07 - legal name or you can just choose the
43:09 - name that is up to you let's also
43:12 - perhaps get this person's email address
43:14 - because we probably want to keep that
43:16 - right so let's find
43:21 - email
43:22 - address and this time once again I'm
43:25 - just going to go back to web hooks and
43:27 - get the email address okay wonderful so
43:33 - this is looking good let's add a few
43:35 - more let's also perhaps have the annual
43:39 - revenue I think that's a good one and I
43:41 - did see that on clear bit so let's go
43:43 - here and this comes under
43:45 - metrics so let's find metrics annual
43:50 - revenue okay and we can keep going and
43:54 - going but another good one to have is
43:56 - I'm just just going to show you this now
43:59 - the score of the company or as HubSpot
44:02 - likes to call it the clout score okay
44:06 - and the value of this because it is you
44:08 - know a company with over 100
44:11 - employees in the software world I'm
44:14 - going to manually hard code the cloud
44:16 - score of this so that in hubs but issues
44:19 - up as hot and as the clout score I'm
44:21 - just going to put 10 okay and I'm just
44:24 - going to hit Okay so let's go ahead and
44:28 - try this out right so once again we're
44:30 - just going to use Google uh as the
44:32 - example because we want to essentially
44:35 - see if it filters out so let's try it
44:37 - out I'm just going to run that and now
44:39 - it's waiting for the data and let's go
44:42 - ahead and go with Gary
44:45 - ggar google.com do you have any Studios
44:50 - to
44:51 - rent in Dubai for
44:56 - shortterm
44:58 - submit okay and the scenario was
45:01 - completed that is
45:03 - good and amazing so this has worked it
45:08 - seems to have got to the correct spot
45:12 - and it is from Gary okay we've got the
45:14 - email domain so now if we go to
45:18 - HubSpot I'm just going to log in I'm
45:21 - going to sign in with Google and once
45:25 - again if we now look in in contacts we
45:28 - should see Gary there so
45:31 - contacts and there he is Gary G we even
45:35 - get a little icon of Google that's where
45:38 - he works we get his email address okay
45:41 - and as well as when this was created we
45:44 - get two
45:45 - sample contacts from HubSpot 2 and if I
45:49 - click on Gary it's basically got all the
45:53 - information that I sent over that is
45:56 - necessary
45:57 - for my
45:59 - company okay and to be fair we just sent
46:02 - over the first name the second name the
46:04 - email address and the cloud score so
46:07 - this is looking wonderful I'm just going
46:09 - to do one more thing so now that we're
46:12 - getting Gary in there I'm just going to
46:14 - shut that down we also want to notify
46:17 - everyone at three hogan.com so everyone
46:19 - in our company that we've got a new lead
46:22 - and because we use slack there I'm going
46:24 - to send that over to Slack so I'm just
46:27 - going to add another module I'm just
46:29 - going to zoom in so you can see and
46:31 - click here and now let's search for
46:34 - slack so here we go and we are going
46:38 - to create a message so let's go ahead
46:41 - and find create a message and there we
46:45 - go and now let's create a connection so
46:48 - this connection timee is going to be for
46:50 - a slack user let's name it my slack user
46:53 - connection or you can name it whatever
46:55 - you wish and I'm just going to hit save
46:58 - and this would essentially prompt me to
47:00 - log into my slack
47:03 - Channel okay as I already have one it's
47:05 - a slack Channel called three Hogan you
47:08 - can add another workspace if you wish
47:10 - I'm going to keep it on that and I'm
47:12 - just going to allow this so I'm allowing
47:14 - it essentially to send messages to three
47:18 - hogen which is a slack Channel that I
47:20 - have made so we need to enter the
47:22 - channel name here I'm going to enter it
47:25 - manually so I'm just going to head over
47:27 - to slack and here is my slack username
47:31 - so three hogan. slack.com and now it's
47:35 - asking me for a channel ID or name so if
47:38 - we go back to slack I can create a
47:42 - channel so let's go ahead and do that
47:44 - I'm going to create a channel I'm going
47:46 - to call it q1 leads so that is the name
47:50 - of my channel I'm just going to hit next
47:52 - I'm going to make it visible to anyone
47:53 - in three Hogan so let's go ahead and
47:56 - click create create and I'm going to
47:59 - automatically add anyone who joins
48:01 - through Hogan so there we go okay q1
48:05 - leads is now here
48:09 - great so now I can put q1 leads and as
48:13 - the text I'm going to
48:16 - put you have
48:18 - a
48:21 - new
48:22 - lead lead
48:25 - email
48:28 - address we can even put on hub spot so
48:31 - people know where to go and then here we
48:34 - can put the lead address essentially we
48:37 - can take it from HubSpot so right here
48:40 - we can even have the clout
48:44 - score so that people know this is a good
48:46 - lead that they need to
48:48 - follow okay so here's a clout score I'm
48:51 - just going to put that here and I'm just
48:53 - going to put clout
48:59 - score and really that's it so let's go
49:03 - ahead and click okay so now let's try
49:06 - this one more time so I'm going to run
49:08 - this and we can wait for new data so now
49:11 - it's waiting and I'm just going to go
49:13 - with Fred fee Fred
49:19 - google.com and hey any need two beds for
49:25 - me and I'm just going going to submit so
49:28 - now if we look in here it's accepting
49:30 - the data waiting for the data and as
49:33 - soon as it gets it hopefully we should
49:36 - get a slack
49:38 - message so boom and now if we look in
49:42 - slack
49:44 - amazing we have a new lead on HubSpot
49:47 - lead email address and the cloud score
49:49 - of 10 as of course we hardcode a 10 as a
49:52 - cloud score for Google so amazing this
49:55 - is incredible I'm so so happy with this
49:59 - we do have a few more things to do and
50:02 - that is fill out the other Roots but
50:03 - it's just going to take the same steps
50:05 - that we took previously so this is a bit
50:07 - of great repetition for us so let's do
50:10 - it so let's write our second route so
50:14 - I'm going to set up a filter for this
50:17 - this time let's do continent America
50:19 - employees maybe smaller than 100
50:22 - category
50:24 - software okay so we know what to do the
50:27 - condition for this we're going to use
50:29 - time zone and we're going to do
50:33 - contains okaye in sensitive America and
50:37 - another condition this time for the
50:40 - employee count so let's go ahead and
50:42 - find the metrics once more and find the
50:46 - employees and let's say they have to be
50:49 - lower
50:51 - than
50:55 - so let's find less than 100 okay and add
51:02 - one more rule let's have the industry so
51:05 - industry here again
51:08 - contains case insensitive we're going to
51:11 - go with soft where and great so that is
51:16 - our second scenario we can even move
51:19 - this out a little bit if you want to
51:22 - read and now let's do our third one so
51:25 - this is essentially just going to take
51:27 - anything that doesn't fit the ones
51:30 - above so let's just call this all else
51:35 - okay so now I'm just going to once again
51:38 - add HubSpot CRM and we're going to
51:42 - create a contact so this one right here
51:45 - compact we're going to keep that the
51:47 - same once again let's have first name so
51:50 - I'm just going to search first name and
51:53 - we'll get this from the email
51:57 - contact so I'm just going to get name
51:59 - and select the first name and let's add
52:02 - another property the key for this is
52:05 - going to be
52:07 - last name and we'll have the last name
52:12 - from the custom web hook we're also
52:15 - going to get the company
52:19 - annual revenue we're also going to get
52:23 - the company name so let's go ahead r
52:26 - that and this comes from clearbit and
52:29 - let's get the legal name we'll also get
52:32 - the email address so let's go ahead and
52:35 - get the
52:36 - email address
52:39 - from the web Hook Once More so let's
52:44 - find email and I think we said we would
52:47 - add the
52:49 - annual revenue as well and again this is
52:52 - from Clear bit so I'm just going to get
52:55 - the annual re Vue which is a metric that
52:58 - should live down here so annual revenue
53:01 - and we've got our custom one which is
53:03 - the clout score as well so let's go
53:06 - ahead and search for clout score and
53:08 - this one let's maybe give it like a
53:11 - seven okay
53:15 - great and finally I'm just going to add
53:18 - the last one too so HubSpot
53:21 - CRM create a
53:23 - contact it's just going to be the same
53:26 - so so this is for essentially catching
53:28 - everything that the filters don't catch
53:31 - because the clout score we're going to
53:33 - give it uh slightly different right so
53:36 - first name let's get from contacts name
53:40 - first let's also
53:43 - have last
53:45 - name last name let's also have the
53:50 - company
53:52 - name and as the value we'll get this
53:55 - from clearbit the legal name let's also
53:58 - add the email address so I'm just going
54:01 - to find the
54:06 - email and this will come from the web
54:09 - hook so let's get the email let's also
54:12 - get the annual
54:15 - revenue which lives in
54:19 - clearbit so again this is in metrics
54:23 - annual revenue and our custom one which
54:26 - is the Cloud score so let's search for
54:29 - cloud score and I'm going to give this a
54:32 - two value and click
54:34 - okay and now for this slack integration
54:38 - so for this perhaps let's copy what the
54:41 - text we have is
54:43 - here okay and let's add a module so I'm
54:46 - going to select slack we're going to
54:49 - create a message to the Channel with ID
54:52 - q1 leads and the text we're just going
54:56 - to to paste so we're going to paste that
54:59 - text and as the lead email address this
55:02 - is going to come from HubSpot we're
55:04 - going to find that email and we're going
55:06 - to also find the cloud school which was
55:09 - somewhere at the bottom here Cloud
55:11 - School
55:12 - general making sure to spell q1 leads
55:15 - just the same as here great and let's
55:19 - hit okay and create a message uh once
55:23 - again this should go to q1 leads as the
55:26 - text we're once again we going to have
55:27 - you have a new lead on HubSpot the email
55:30 - address is going to be the email and
55:32 - then let's also put the clout score here
55:35 - so I'm just going to scroll down to find
55:37 - that clout score once more there are
55:39 - many ways you can of course do this
55:41 - perhaps you want to set up a different
55:43 - Channel part each lead whether it's one
55:46 - with clout score 10 or one with Cloud
55:48 - score 8 or one with clout score two it
55:51 - is completely your choice
55:54 - wonderful I'm just going to save this
55:56 - for
55:57 - now so let's go ahead and test it out so
56:01 - I'm just once again going to run this
56:03 - and wait for a new data and of course we
56:05 - need to fill this out so I'm going to go
56:07 - with Anna Kubo I'm going to put Anna at
56:11 - free Cod
56:13 - camp.org and I'm going to put
56:17 - hello and submit and now let's wait for
56:20 - that to do its thing now free go camp
56:22 - does have less than 100 employees and it
56:24 - is in America and it is in software so I
56:27 - would expect it to go down this channel
56:30 - but we will see if it doesn't it should
56:32 - end up here with a cloud score of two so
56:36 - let's see which route it ends up
56:40 - in ah so it seem to have gone this way I
56:43 - wonder why that is let's have a look so
56:47 - freecodecamp.org it's got the
56:49 - description time zone is America
56:53 - interesting and employees is 46 so
56:57 - perhaps it's the industry that is making
57:00 - it go down this route let's have a look
57:03 - category industry diversify consumer
57:06 - services okay but if it was software
57:09 - hopefully it would have gone this route
57:12 - instead and let's just check that has
57:14 - worked in slack let's see the message so
57:17 - we should get a message at we have a new
57:19 - lead on HubSpot lead email address and
57:22 - at. Cloud score too so we did expect
57:26 - that that is looking good and if we look
57:28 - on HubSpot
57:30 - now we have Ana Kubo we've got the logo
57:34 - We've Got Annie at freeer app.org this
57:37 - is looking so wonderful I'm so so happy
57:40 - with this okay great so I hope you've
57:44 - learned a lot of course there is a lot
57:46 - of personalized stuff you can do you
57:48 - don't have to follow along with my
57:49 - strict instructions especially when it
57:52 - comes to the rooting part of course each
57:55 - company is unique so please go ahead and
57:57 - set up your own filters around this
58:00 - hopefully you should have the knowledge
58:01 - to do so
58:05 - now okay so in this scenario we're going
58:08 - to pretend we're a real estate company
58:11 - and we are essentially looking to find
58:14 - leads of owners of properties they
58:16 - either want to sell them or rent them
58:18 - out okay so we're going to have a for
58:22 - somewhere on the internet that collects
58:23 - their name their contact email address
58:26 - and the rough value of their property in
58:29 - order to then put all that information
58:31 - into a CRM HubSpot CRM to be precise
58:35 - okay so that's what we're going to do
58:38 - I'm just going to show you exactly where
58:40 - in HubSpot we're going to put this so
58:43 - here is HubSpot I'm just going to go
58:45 - ahead and log in because I already have
58:47 - a HubSpot account so I'm going to choose
58:50 - to sign in with Google of course please
58:53 - do sign up to HubSpot if you don't have
58:55 - an account already I'm just signing in
58:58 - like so and it's going to take me to my
59:00 - HubSpot account now in HubSpot you can
59:03 - collect contacts or you can collect
59:07 - deals so we're going to do that under
59:10 - sales and Deals we're going to start
59:13 - deals in order to take them from
59:15 - prospecting to finalized and closed so
59:19 - we're going to essentially be adding to
59:21 - The Columns of deal owner we have create
59:24 - date last activity date Clos date and a
59:27 - bunch more so this is what we're going
59:29 - to be using so let's go ahead and do it
59:34 - I'm going to create a new scenario and
59:36 - like I said we're going to be using a
59:38 - form I'm going to go ahead and use type
59:40 - form for this here it is and we're going
59:43 - to watch responses but we're going to
59:47 - choose this one so instant okay so it
59:50 - triggers as soon as someone fills in
59:52 - your form somewhere out there in the
59:54 - world so that's going to choose and I'm
59:57 - going to go ahead and create a web hook
59:59 - so please go ahead and choose create web
60:01 - hook and because I have used type form
60:05 - before it already shows up here so for
60:08 - those of you who don't have a type form
60:10 - account please go ahead and sign up I do
60:12 - so I'm just going to go ahead and log
60:15 - in so I'm going to choose to log in with
60:18 - Google please go ahead and do all the
60:20 - steps that you need in order to sign up
60:21 - or log in if you've used type form
60:23 - before and it should take you
60:27 - here okay so first off of course we need
60:29 - to create a new form you can do this
60:31 - using AI so this is quite fun you can
60:34 - essentially tell it what you want to
60:35 - create and then it'll suggest inputs and
60:38 - essentially suggest a form that you
60:41 - might need you might not even think of
60:42 - some of the inputs so sometimes it's fun
60:44 - to use this so for example lead
60:46 - generation form like that but I know
60:49 - what I want to create so I'm just going
60:51 - to go ahead and choose create new form
60:53 - and start from scratch okay so that's
60:56 - what I'm going to choose I'm going to
60:58 - call this lead generation you can call
61:00 - it whatever you wish and I'm going to
61:04 - say that this is a leaden form so I'm
61:07 - going to click continue now this is
61:10 - great because you can really go wild on
61:12 - designing this um we have hello what's
61:16 - your name so I do suggest keeping that
61:19 - because that is something we're going to
61:20 - need we're going to have the
61:22 - deal name in here so let's let's go
61:26 - ahead and keep that helloo what is your
61:28 - name and then someone will answer it I'm
61:30 - going to make this required and I'm
61:32 - actually going to go ahead and change
61:33 - the image because we're a real estate
61:34 - company so you can go in the media
61:38 - gallery and select from all the things
61:39 - that type form has so if I type in real
61:42 - estate just like so I'm going to go
61:44 - ahead and select this one right here and
61:48 - wonderful so that's just looking better
61:50 - to go to the next question you can
61:53 - simply click here the second question
61:55 - has given is nice to meet you and you
61:57 - can actually insert the name that they
61:59 - just answered before I'll show you how
62:02 - to do that how's your day going however
62:04 - we don't really need this I'm going to
62:06 - go ahead and delete it so please go
62:09 - ahead and do the same to add a new
62:11 - question though just go ahead and click
62:13 - here and this is lead
62:17 - qualification I think the next thing we
62:19 - should ask for is perhaps their email so
62:23 - I'm going to go ahead and add that here
62:26 - um we can go nice to meet you and then
62:30 - the at sign will allow us to bring us
62:33 - previous inputs so I can go ahead and do
62:37 - that nice to meet you and then whatever
62:40 - their name
62:41 - is please
62:46 - provide an email where we can
62:51 - contact
62:52 - you and then we have that let's also
62:55 - make this required so wonderful this is
62:58 - looking good I'm just going to add one
62:59 - more question and this is going to be a
63:02 - drop-down so this is just to get the
63:05 - value of the property okay so we know
63:07 - how much this deal is worth I guess
63:10 - again these questions are just for demo
63:12 - purposes if you have a company I would
63:14 - strongly suggest really sitting down and
63:16 - really thinking about what questions you
63:18 - want to ask someone but again demo
63:21 - purposes I'm not uh using my emotional
63:24 - intelligency or anything like that so
63:26 - I'm just going to go ahead and write how
63:30 - much is your property worth very
63:36 - direct okay and here we could just write
63:38 - it I'm just going to go ahead and select
63:42 - uh a
63:44 - few again
63:48 - please feel free to do this much better
63:51 - than I am uh let's go ahead and also
63:54 - specify that this is in us so there's
63:57 - five options right here so that's the
63:59 - three questions I'm going to have let's
64:00 - also make this required of course if
64:03 - properties is worth more it would be
64:05 - worth having more options and let's have
64:08 - an ending so I'm going to select here
64:10 - for an ending and I'm going to choose to
64:12 - have an end screen you can redirect to
64:14 - our URL however this is a paid feature
64:17 - so if you don't want to pay for it don't
64:18 - use that so let's go ahead and do it I'm
64:21 - going to go ahead and say thank you
64:28 - name we will be in contact soon and then
64:34 - you can of course choose to have these
64:37 - share icons I'm going to get rid of that
64:41 - so great now I'm just going to delete
64:44 - this ending as we just want the one
64:45 - ending page and I'm going to go ahead
64:48 - and publish this so that is now being
64:51 - published let's go ahead and copy that
64:53 - link to check it out so so here is my
64:56 - Forum this is what I would use in order
64:59 - to essentially share it around let's go
65:02 - ahead and do Ana
65:04 - Kubo okay uh I'm going to go with
65:08 - Ana at code with
65:12 - anna. okay and then I'm just going to
65:15 - select the first one and submit and
65:18 - great that is now finished and you can
65:20 - see my name is showing up this is
65:23 - looking cool so now let's go ahead ahe
65:25 - and actually use this so I'm going to go
65:29 - ahead and select the form ID so this
65:31 - should show up I'm going to refresh
65:35 - this there we go lead generation because
65:38 - this is what I called my Forum if we go
65:41 - back to my workspaces you will see
65:43 - that's the only form in here it's called
65:44 - lead generation so there's only one in
65:47 - the drop down right here and I'm just
65:49 - going to click save so that's really it
65:53 - and I'm just going to go ahead and click
65:55 - okay
65:56 - now we need to connect this to HubSpot
65:58 - so I'm going to search for HubSpot just
66:01 - like so and this time we're going to
66:03 - create a deal so search for create a
66:06 - deal and just select it from all the
66:08 - various things that exist now we're
66:11 - going to make a HubSpot connection uh of
66:14 - course I've already connected this to my
66:18 - make.com platform hence it's showing up
66:21 - so please go ahead and do that if yours
66:23 - isn't showing up and you need to set up
66:25 - that connction
66:26 - now I'm going to go ahead and map things
66:29 - out so the key here again this is just
66:32 - from the column names that we see up
66:35 - here I'm going to go ahead and have
66:38 - the should we have the deal name for the
66:41 - deal name I'm just going to use whoever
66:43 - filled out the form's first name so here
66:46 - because we already connected type form
66:49 - it's already
66:51 - connecting to our Forum so the first
66:55 - question we ask us hello what's your
66:56 - name then we have nice to meet you your
66:58 - name please provide an email and how
67:00 - much is your property worth in dollars
67:03 - so let's go ahead with the first name
67:05 - right because that's what we want to the
67:07 - value to be under deal name I'm going to
67:10 - go ahead and add another one so let's
67:12 - also have uh deal stage this time so I
67:17 - can actually just search for deal stage
67:20 - and we're just going to hard code this
67:21 - okay to be
67:23 - prospecting so this is hard coded
67:26 - because you know if something comes in
67:27 - it's always going to be fresh it's going
67:28 - to start prospecting and then develop to
67:30 - the furthest stages of the sales
67:33 - pipeline next one I'm also going to have
67:36 - is the amount so the amount here is just
67:40 - going to be how much the deal is worth
67:42 - and I guess we can have the property
67:44 - worth for that okay which has to be a
67:46 - number otherwise this will not work
67:48 - hence I wrote numbers when writing out
67:51 - my type form form okay wonderful so I'm
67:56 - happy with this I'm just going to select
67:59 - okay so now let's go ahead and do it
68:02 - right I'm going to run this and this is
68:04 - now going to wait for information so I'm
68:07 - going to have to go back here and then
68:09 - let's get the URL for this so copy link
68:12 - and I'm just going to paste it in here
68:14 - once more and this time let's do someone
68:17 - else let's do
68:18 - Bobby Brown okay and then let's do Bob
68:23 - BB at gmail.
68:26 - com
68:27 - okay uh let's go ahead and put this one
68:30 - this time and submit okay so this means
68:34 - that this should now
68:39 - run uh something did not work
68:41 - prospecting is not a valid pipeline
68:43 - stage ID so that is fine here are the
68:48 - valid options let's go ahead and do this
68:52 - here we can do qualify to buy so we can
68:56 - actually select that this just means
68:58 - that here under value I'm just going to
69:01 - change that to be qualified to buy and
69:04 - hit okay so once again so that debugging
69:07 - tool is really super useful let's try
69:10 - this once more I'm just going to refresh
69:12 - the form and then let's go with Ken Fang
69:16 - okay KF at
69:20 - gmail.com okay and then let's just
69:23 - select another value and hit submit
69:26 - so now that should work that has because
69:28 - all these bubbles have gone through we
69:30 - don't get any errors we don't have to
69:32 - debug anything even though the debugging
69:34 - method is quite cool that does give you
69:35 - a lot of information there in order to
69:37 - make debugging a heck of a lot easier so
69:40 - now under deals Tada we have Ken Fang we
69:44 - have the deals stage as qualified to buy
69:46 - because we did hard code that everyone
69:48 - in here is qualified to buy essentially
69:50 - we have a deal owner which is unassigned
69:52 - and we have the deal value amount great
69:55 - this is looking good and of course if we
69:57 - add more leads to this via the form they
70:01 - will also show up so great I hope this
70:06 - was useful thank you very
70:10 - much okay in this section I'm going to
70:13 - show you how to essentially filter out
70:16 - if leads are qualified enough so for
70:19 - example if you get a lead from the
70:21 - company apple.com so someone's emailed
70:24 - in with the apple.com domain
70:26 - you can use automation to essentially
70:28 - filter out if this is a company you want
70:30 - to pursue so for example if it's got a
70:32 - high enough employee count high enough
70:35 - market cap and so on so I'm going to
70:38 - show you how to do this using Google
70:40 - Sheets and clear bit so let's do it
70:44 - let's go ahead and create a new scenario
70:46 - for this and we are going to be using a
70:48 - spreadsheet so a spreadsheet of these
70:51 - leads it's going to have an email
70:53 - address it's going to have their name
70:55 - and then we're going to automate the
70:56 - others so just head on over to your
70:59 - Google Drive and create a sheet I'm just
71:02 - going to select sheets in order to do
71:04 - this and go ahead and select blank sheet
71:08 - and let's go ahead and call this leads
71:11 - to qualify so that we can pick it out
71:13 - later on I'm going to keep this as sheet
71:16 - one but of course please feel free to
71:18 - rename this if you wish this you can
71:21 - rename this you can rename just make
71:23 - sure to keep an eye on this so you don't
71:25 - lose track while following this
71:27 - tutorial so let's go ahead and first off
71:30 - create the table head I'm going to have
71:33 - email like I said we'll also have the
71:35 - name of the lead we'll have the lead
71:38 - status we're all going to start off with
71:40 - the same lead status for all of these at
71:42 - the beginning we'll also have a last
71:45 - scene why not the company
71:48 - name and let's also have the number of
71:54 - employees we can have the employee range
71:57 - as well let's also have the market cap
71:59 - for the company and the Alexa ranking
72:03 - this is going to be a global ranking of
72:05 - the company so for example let's go
72:07 - ahead and do this our first lead that we
72:10 - have is Michael Scott at
72:16 - dundermifflin
72:18 - paper.com and then of course let's have
72:21 - the name so this is
72:23 - Michael Scott
72:27 - the lead status uh we're going to have
72:29 - not verified and we're going to
72:30 - overwrite this this is going to be
72:32 - overwritten once we
72:35 - essentially communicate with clearbit
72:37 - and use the automation to essentially
72:39 - fill out this and these as well the last
72:42 - scene is going to be a generic date okay
72:46 - this is just for demo purposes so cool
72:50 - there we have our first lead now you you
72:55 - can also choose to you
72:58 - know let's go ahead and make this look a
73:01 - little bit prettier just so you can
73:02 - visually see that this is indeed the
73:05 - header this is essentially where all our
73:08 - leads is going to go I'm just going to
73:10 - make it yellow and we can also use this
73:13 - right here to underline it if we wish so
73:17 - great um I'm going to fill out a few
73:19 - more of these while we are here so let's
73:22 - have John do at integro match
73:25 - as a company that uh will definitely
73:28 - qualify I
73:30 - believe and let's put John do again
73:34 - let's put not verified and as the date
73:37 - here I'm just going to put that let's
73:41 - also have
73:42 - Dwight
73:43 - Sho at
73:46 - Dunder let's make sure to spell it the
73:48 - same I'm just going to copy
73:50 - that dundermifflin paper.com this does
73:53 - exist on clearbit
73:56 - uh I'm pretty sure it's just for demo
73:57 - purposes but still it's kind of fun
74:00 - Dwight Sho not verified and let's put a
74:04 - date for this too the next one let's
74:07 - maybe have the company Apple so Jane do
74:10 - at apple.com we of course know this is a
74:13 - very big company but let's see if
74:15 - clearbit does so once again not verified
74:19 - I'm just going to put a date and then
74:20 - we're going to see if it'll pick up
74:23 - Apple the company name the the number of
74:25 - employees it has and the employee range
74:27 - as well as the market cap and the Alexa
74:29 - ranking of apple as in the thing that
74:31 - makes your iPhones and so on let's also
74:34 - have another company Eddie Jones at
74:41 - chevron.com
74:43 - so Eddie Jones not verified and let's
74:48 - put a date here as
74:50 - well uh and one last one Jim help
74:55 - at Dunder
74:57 - Mifflin Jim
75:00 - Halper not verified 22 3 20
75:06 - 20 okay great so that is my spreadsheet
75:11 - please make sure to make the same as
75:13 - this for now for demo purposes and once
75:15 - you understand this scenario you can
75:17 - then go on and make your own so copy
75:20 - this pause it if you need to and once
75:22 - you are ready let's go
75:25 - so I'm just going to go back here and
75:27 - the first thing we need to do is of
75:30 - course listen out to Google Sheets so go
75:34 - ahead and find Google Sheets on
75:40 - here just like I have and we're going to
75:43 - watch for new rows so we're going to
75:45 - watch new rows this first one right here
75:47 - and whenever a new road is added at the
75:49 - moment we've added a lot of rows then
75:52 - this will trigger some stuff so so let's
75:55 - create a connection first I'm just going
75:57 - to select this it's going to be a Google
75:59 - connection that's what I've chosen to
76:01 - call this connection uh and this is just
76:03 - allowing integram mat to essentially
76:06 - give us
76:08 - access okay so we're going to have to
76:10 - sign in with Google this is going to
76:12 - take me to this popup right here I'm
76:15 - going to choose the account I want to
76:17 - sign into and then I'm going to just
76:20 - click continue so great make wants to
76:23 - access your Google account I'm going to
76:25 - click allow and then that should be it
76:29 - so now we are connected to my Google
76:32 - account uh we can test this out because
76:35 - I can select the spreadsheet ID and
76:37 - search for
76:39 - leads to qualify so this first one right
76:44 - here and it's found it and it also knows
76:47 - that we just have sheet one we have one
76:49 - sheet that's what we called it here so
76:51 - we're just picking this out out of leads
76:53 - to qualify great
76:55 - this table does contain a header as you
76:57 - can see here so I'm going to keep that
76:59 - as yes uh the res with headers are A to
77:02 - Z I'm going to keep that the same and
77:04 - I'm just going to hit okay
77:08 - wonderful and I'm just going to select
77:11 - all
77:14 - okay so now let's go ahead and add
77:16 - another module so we did say we want to
77:19 - use Clear bit in order to assess the
77:22 - person or company that essentially we're
77:25 - going to feed in so select get a person
77:27 - or company and once again we're going to
77:30 - have to create a connection for this so
77:32 - let's go ahead and create a
77:34 - connection now this is going to need an
77:36 - API key so please go ahead and head over
77:39 - to clear bit so here we are I have
77:44 - logged into this previously so here I am
77:47 - of course please sign up if you need to
77:50 - I already have an account which I've
77:52 - already done all the sign up process for
77:54 - or already so I'm just going to choose
77:56 - to log in uh I'm going to put in my
77:59 - email address here I'm just going to put
78:02 - Ana at code with an.com and send in a
78:06 - sign-in link so now if I head over to
78:09 - Gmail this time I'm just going to head
78:11 - over to my Gmail account of course I
78:13 - should see that in my email and I do so
78:17 - I'm just going to choose to log in okay
78:20 - so this is just what you have to do in
78:23 - order to log into to clear bit and it's
78:25 - going to ask you to sign in with HubSpot
78:27 - okay so you need to also have a HubSpot
78:29 - account in order to do this if you don't
78:32 - you'll be prompted once again to sign up
78:33 - to hopspot but I already do have a
78:35 - hopspot account so I'm just going to
78:37 - choose to sign in
78:40 - great okay so let's go ahead and sign in
78:43 - I'm just going to choose to sign in with
78:47 - Google so once again I am just going
78:50 - through the steps in order to sign up
78:52 - and then my company that I have on
78:55 - HubSpot would show up so here is my
78:57 - account it's called three Hogan it's
78:59 - from the very first video that we did in
79:02 - this course so let's go ahead and choose
79:04 - that
79:05 - account great so this app is now
79:08 - requesting access to my HubSpot account
79:11 - as well because clearbit is linked to
79:13 - HubSpot and once you have accepted that
79:16 - it will take you to this dashboard so
79:19 - here is your dashboard but in order to
79:21 - actually get the API you're going to
79:23 - have to go to a different URL L it's
79:25 - dashboard. cit.com
79:29 - SL API so make sure to type that out and
79:33 - hit enter and here is your API key okay
79:36 - just go ahead and copy that once again
79:38 - please keep this safe and if you do lose
79:41 - it you can get it changed or revoke by
79:43 - contacting
79:45 - clearit so great let's now go back to
79:48 - here and just paste in that API key and
79:50 - I'm going to hit save so wonderful that
79:54 - is now doing its thing and all we're
79:56 - going to do is get the email address
79:58 - from the Google sheet so just select
80:01 - email right here okay once again this
80:04 - has been read from this Google sheet so
80:08 - it's taking the columns right here as
80:11 - you will see make sure just to select it
80:13 - and don't have any other text in here
80:16 - and that's it just go ahead and hit okay
80:19 - now we're going to actually do some
80:21 - rooting so just find the rout under flow
80:24 - control
80:25 - and we're essentially going to write
80:27 - some Roots so we're going to have to
80:29 - Define what makes this a qualified lead
80:32 - okay so we can do that here we can set
80:34 - up a filter and let's just say that you
80:38 - know this is a
80:40 - qualified lead if let's write a
80:43 - condition if the company so I'm just
80:46 - going to go ahead and this is
80:49 - essentially what's coming back to us
80:50 - from clearbit we have an example as well
80:53 - that's quite nice for them to provide an
80:54 - example value for us so we can kind of
80:57 - see what's going on so there's a lot
81:00 - coming back from clearbit there's you
81:02 - know stuff under Facebook stuff under
81:05 - GitHub even so GitHub accounts geography
81:08 - this is really crazy the one we need to
81:11 - find however is metrics and let's just
81:13 - say that use the employees for this okay
81:18 - so let's go ahead and do that let's say
81:22 - that if the employees which in this case
81:26 - is 90 is larger than or equal so let's
81:31 - find that from here greater
81:34 - than or you can do greater than or equal
81:37 - to it is up to
81:40 - you and let's go with 50 then it makes a
81:43 - qualified lead okay that for us is a
81:46 - qualified lead of course you can change
81:48 - it you can put 500 in which case you're
81:50 - only targeting you know bigger companies
81:53 - than ones with 50 employees
81:55 - so that is my definition of a qualified
81:58 - read and then here is just going to be
82:01 - all the not qualified ones which is
82:03 - essentially just going to take
82:05 - everything else so we can just label
82:07 - this not
82:10 - qualified lead okay and I'm just going
82:12 - to leave it blank one other thing we're
82:14 - going to have to do here is just set
82:16 - this as a fullback and just hit okay so
82:19 - now here we're going to have to send
82:21 - that qualified lead to Google Sheets and
82:24 - we're just going to update a row so once
82:26 - again all I'm going to do is
82:28 - essentially pick this spreadsheet ID so
82:31 - leads to
82:37 - qualify okay that is my spreadsheet ID
82:40 - and then let's find the sheet name which
82:42 - is sheet one the row number is just
82:44 - going to be whatever row we're working
82:46 - on so it's not going to come from Clear
82:48 - bit so I'm going to collapse that it's
82:49 - going to come from Google sheet and I'm
82:51 - just going to select the row number this
82:54 - table does contain headers we do know
82:56 - that the email address well that's
82:58 - already been done as is the name so
83:01 - we'll keep that as it is the lead status
83:03 - we want to override and we're going to
83:05 - put
83:08 - qualified okay so we can put qualified
83:12 - there last scene we're going to leave
83:14 - blank once again this uses me hardcoding
83:17 - something and this is what's going to
83:19 - come back from Clear be that we want to
83:21 - fill in so the company what we're just
83:24 - is going to put the company name and
83:26 - that lives here so under company name
83:29 - let's also fill in the number of
83:31 - employees so once again this is a whole
83:34 - object right uh we're going to go into
83:36 - company we're going to go into metrics
83:39 - and we're going to get the employee
83:41 - count then we'll have the employee range
83:43 - which also lives under metrics we're
83:45 - going to get the market cap okay so if
83:48 - that exists then it will be put in there
83:50 - and the Alexa ranking the global ranking
83:54 - of the company and hit okay and now we
83:58 - also need to do the same for here so
84:00 - let's update a row this is for the not
84:02 - qualified leads the only difference here
84:05 - I'm just going to show you so first off
84:07 - let's actually select the spreadsheet
84:10 - that we need so
84:13 - leads to
84:15 - qualify and then just make sure that the
84:18 - sheet number is also selected and it's
84:20 - correct so the sheet name is going to be
84:22 - sheet one the row number that we're
84:25 - working with once again this comes from
84:27 - Google Sheets so we're just going to
84:28 - select the arow number the table does
84:31 - contain headers the email is going to be
84:33 - the same the name's going to be the same
84:35 - like I said this going to be identical
84:36 - to what's going on here apart from the
84:38 - lead status which is going to be
84:42 - not qualified and we're going to
84:45 - essentially overwrite the not verified
84:48 - here okay uh last scene we're going to
84:51 - leave as it is the company well once
84:53 - again this comes from clear bit so let's
84:55 - go in here uh we don't need the person
84:57 - we're going to have the company name for
85:00 - this so company name let's also get the
85:03 - employees which is under metrics so the
85:06 - employee count the employee range which
85:09 - is this the market cap so once again
85:12 - this is under metric and the Alexa
85:15 - ranking which is right here great so I'm
85:22 - happy with that let's say okay and now
85:26 - let's give it a whirl so I'm just going
85:28 - to go ahead and run this and see it
85:32 - completing all the steps and wonderful
85:35 - that is done and if we look in here so
85:38 - this is working let's once again run it
85:41 - once more so there we go it's doing its
85:44 - thing and
85:47 - great and let's run it once
85:52 - more and good great so we have now
85:55 - filled out this whole sheet this is
85:58 - looking good I'm really happy with
86:02 - this if you want to change it so that
86:04 - you know you can essentially limit the
86:08 - maximum number of results or you want
86:10 - all of them to run that is up to you I'm
86:12 - going to go ahead and change this to one
86:14 - and now if we add something else so
86:17 - let's go ahead and
86:23 - add Maybe these two again
86:26 - not
86:29 - verified
86:31 - not
86:33 - verified make this
86:36 - be Danny
86:39 - do Danny
86:42 - to and here Annie
86:46 - Lee Annie
86:50 - Lee and run this
86:53 - again
86:57 - then this time you will see just one
86:59 - time it has run great and that line has
87:02 - been added this is looking wonderful and
87:06 - that's it now you can go ahead and add
87:09 - way more leads to this if you want that
87:12 - part is going to be completely up to you
87:16 - okay so now that you know how to do this
87:19 - I would suggest making this by yourself
87:22 - from scratch changing the uh definitions
87:26 - for a qualified lead and a not qualified
87:29 - lead that could be a fun one to do in
87:31 - addition to you know having just one
87:35 - criteria in order to make this a
87:37 - qualified lead you can have more if you
87:40 - want to add more you can do the and and
87:43 - rule in which this has to be true and
87:46 - this has to be true okay or you can do
87:49 - it that this has to be true or something
87:52 - has to be true so I could say that you
87:54 - know either the company metrics employee
87:57 - count has to be greater than 50 or you
88:00 - know if we don't care about that we can
88:02 - do something else we can use the
88:06 - metrics annual revenue perhaps and if
88:09 - it's higher than a certain amount so we
88:12 - can
88:13 - do greater
88:16 - than you
88:18 - know 10,000 then it's also a qualified
88:22 - loot so that is something something you
88:25 - can also do and just have a play around
88:28 - with it is going to be completely up to
88:30 - you you can also use metrics and things
88:35 - that come back from the object from
88:37 - Clear bit that you don't necessarily use
88:40 - here so you don't as you notice we
88:42 - didn't choose to use the Alexa ranking
88:44 - the market H the employee range uh or
88:47 - the company we chose something
88:49 - completely all together so please feel
88:51 - free to have a look through all of these
88:54 - and you know you can use whichever one
88:56 - you want you can use the founding year
88:58 - for example too so there really is so so
89:02 - much you can play around with okay I'm
89:05 - just going to delete that so we can keep
89:07 - it the same for now you can also choose
89:11 - whether to schedule this so you can
89:13 - schedule it at 15minute intervals or
89:16 - once a day or on certain days of the
89:19 - month that is also a fun one and like I
89:22 - said if you click on here here is where
89:24 - you limit the amount of number of
89:27 - results to be work with during one cycle
89:29 - so that is something to keep in mind
89:31 - that's why we you know got two to update
89:34 - each time and when we changed it it was
89:36 - just one you can also change it if you
89:39 - wish great I hope that was useful for
89:46 - you did you know that you can use a
89:49 - spreadsheet that has all the information
89:51 - about a product to generate an SEO
89:53 - friendly description
89:55 - for example say I ran a real estate
89:57 - company and had hundreds of properties
89:59 - in my portfolio I have the property
90:01 - address how many bedrooms it has and the
90:03 - view from each one now based on just
90:06 - these three properties I can generate
90:08 - some pretty compelling descriptions to
90:10 - help sell my properties in under a
90:12 - minute including how far away the
90:14 - property is from a metro station what
90:17 - are the closest Larks to it and more I
90:20 - can do so using chat GPT and its access
90:22 - to global map features I'm going to show
90:25 - you how to do this
90:29 - next okay so let's go ahead and create a
90:33 - scenario so I'm just going to go ahead
90:36 - and do that here we're going to create a
90:38 - scenario that allows us to create this
90:40 - completions that we were talking about
90:42 - mainly completions to go here to fill
90:45 - out a description of my property based
90:49 - on the property name the bedrooms the
90:52 - bathrooms the City View and the address
90:55 - and we're going to use the address in
90:56 - order to find the closest landmarks and
90:58 - the closest Metro to our property using
91:02 - open AI so this is pretty cool obviously
91:07 - there is not a lot of data here as this
91:09 - is just for demo purposes but I hope you
91:11 - can imagine how useful this is when you
91:13 - have thousands of properties in your
91:16 - database okay so let's do it I'm going
91:19 - to go ahead and create that scenario now
91:22 - and we're going to add you guest it our
91:24 - module so I'm just going to select here
91:27 - and the module we're going to start off
91:28 - with is Google Sheets as we're going to
91:31 - have to pick up the data from the Google
91:33 - sheet first so I'm going to select watch
91:37 - new rows so this will trigger when a new
91:39 - row is added so let's go ahead and
91:41 - select that and I'm going to create a
91:43 - connection so let's go ahead and create
91:46 - my connection my Google connection and
91:48 - I'm just going to sign in with Google in
91:51 - order to allow make.com to speak to my
91:54 - Google account so I'm just going to have
91:56 - to sign in in order to do that and make
91:59 - want to access my Google account this is
92:02 - my Google account I essentially agree to
92:06 - allow it to have access to see edit
92:08 - create and delete my Google Drive files
92:11 - as well as see edit create and delete
92:13 - all my Google sheet spreadsheets so I'm
92:16 - just going to click allow in order to do
92:18 - that great and amazing that is now done
92:24 - I'm going to choose to search by path we
92:27 - can choose to enter manually or select
92:30 - from all and then I'm just going to
92:32 - select my drive as in my Google Drive
92:35 - and then we're going to have to find the
92:36 - spreadsheet ID we're going to do so by
92:38 - name so this is my properties so let's
92:42 - go ahead and do that I'm just going to
92:43 - search for my
92:47 - properties just like so great and now
92:51 - we're going to have to pick out the
92:52 - sheet name so there could be multiple
92:54 - tabs here or multiple sheet names
92:57 - however there is just one which makes
92:58 - our life a lot easier because from the
93:00 - drop down we could just select
93:02 - properties now this table does contain
93:06 - headers as you can see here so I'm going
93:09 - to keep yes in the drop-down okay and
93:13 - then row with headers now I can just
93:15 - keep it as it is or I can be super
93:17 - specific saying it's A1 B1 C1 D1 E1 and
93:23 - F1 so I've just changed that you don't
93:25 - have to if you don't want to I'm just
93:27 - going to make the maximum number of
93:29 - results we work with during one
93:30 - execution cycle one and I'm going to hit
93:34 - okay now when it says choose where to
93:37 - start I'm just going to select all and
93:39 - once again hit okay as well great now
93:43 - that we have that we're going to have to
93:45 - add another module so this time I'm
93:48 - going to choose the open AI module as we
93:50 - want to essentially talk to open AI in
93:53 - in order to send a prompt over so that's
93:57 - what I'm going to do and we're going to
93:59 - choose to generate a completion so let's
94:03 - select create a completion and I'm just
94:05 - going to move that over here so it is
94:07 - connected to the first module we made
94:11 - and I'm going to create a connection so
94:14 - I'm just going to have to head over to
94:16 - open
94:17 - Ai and log in so this is my open AI
94:22 - account I have signed up and I am paying
94:25 - customer so just make sure that your
94:27 - account is funded and you are a paying
94:29 - customer or if you have some free
94:31 - credits to use that's great for you but
94:34 - just make sure you do have some funds in
94:36 - this otherwise it will not work great
94:39 - now I'm just going to head over to API
94:40 - keys and I'm going to create a new
94:42 - secret key I'm going to call this
94:45 - demo key just like so and create it of
94:49 - course you know the drill please do keep
94:52 - this API key safe because if someone
94:54 - takes it and uses it for their own
94:56 - project they could rack up loads and
94:58 - loads on your credit card bill so don't
95:01 - share it around and in fact I am going
95:02 - to delete this after the tutorial is
95:05 - finished so please don't take mine
95:06 - either wonderful so we have our API key
95:11 - and
95:13 - now we're just going to paste it in like
95:15 - so the other thing we need to do is also
95:18 - pasted in the organization ID and that
95:21 - can be found back here here under
95:24 - settings and there we are that is my one
95:28 - right
95:30 - here and just paste it in like so and
95:33 - hit save so that connection is now done
95:37 - we can now communicate with open AI so
95:40 - now I'm going to select create a chat
95:42 - completion this is just so that we can
95:45 - use the latest model okay we're not
95:47 - really creating a chat we're just going
95:49 - to send over one prompt but if we were
95:51 - to choose create a prompt completion
95:54 - the latest model we can get only goes up
95:56 - to GPT
95:59 - 3.5 okay so there we go now if you don't
96:02 - have access to GPT 4 I am going to show
96:05 - you how to use GPT 3.5 cuz there will be
96:07 - one thing that we have to do differently
96:10 - but I will show you that in a bit for
96:12 - now I'm going to show you how to use
96:14 - chat gb4 and like I said for that we're
96:16 - going to have to create a chat
96:18 - completion and this will give us GPT 4
96:21 - again we are not making a chat we simply
96:23 - going to send over one prompt and get a
96:26 - returning response so just keep that in
96:29 - mind now as the message well we're going
96:32 - to have to choose a role I'm going to
96:35 - choose the user so me because me as a
96:37 - user I'm going to be asking open AI a
96:40 - question and that question is
96:42 - essentially a request and my request is
96:45 - please write a description no longer
96:47 - than seven sentences on my property
96:49 - along with the nearest landmarks based
96:51 - on its address please also mention how
96:54 - many minutes work from the Metro only if
96:57 - it's less than 15 minutes great and now
96:59 - we're just going to feed in that
97:01 - information please write this based on
97:06 - the
97:07 - following property
97:10 - information and I'm going to put the
97:13 - property name uh and we're going to
97:16 - actually use the data coming back from
97:19 - our Google sheet okay this is the data
97:21 - coming back from our Google sheet thanks
97:24 - to the first module we made and I'm just
97:26 - going to select the property name I'm
97:29 - also going to put the
97:32 - amount
97:33 - of
97:35 - bedrooms and use the bedrooms column and
97:40 - the amount
97:41 - of bathrooms and use the bathrooms
97:45 - column we're also going to get the view
97:48 - which is either a City View or a c view
97:50 - so let's put in the view and of course
97:53 - the address and that lives in the
97:55 - address column great so that's
97:58 - essentially what I am sending over to
98:01 - open AI in order for it to make a
98:03 - description for us so I'm just going to
98:05 - hit okay now that we are essentially
98:08 - sending a prompt over to open Ai and
98:12 - it's going to get us a result we want to
98:15 - put it back in the spreadsheet or more
98:17 - specifically in this column so once
98:19 - again let's get a module so I'm just
98:22 - going to go ahead and add a module it's
98:24 - going to be Google Sheets and we are
98:26 - going to update a row this time now we
98:30 - are going to once again use this
98:32 - spreadsheet ID we can use it from this
98:37 - Google sheet right here from that data
98:40 - but then we'll just have to enter it
98:42 - manually okay so there we go and I'm
98:45 - just going to select the spreadsheet ID
98:48 - okay which essentially is my properties
98:51 - we get the sheet name but that's being
98:52 - fed in from the first Google sheet and
98:55 - then we're going to get the row number
98:56 - so I'm just going to whack that in like
98:58 - so now the column range I'm just going
99:00 - to select a to z and then we're going to
99:03 - actually find column F so this one right
99:06 - here so right there and we're going to
99:08 - use the return from open AI so this is
99:11 - the return object and we're going to
99:15 - find the return and it actually comes in
99:18 - the message content so that's what our
99:20 - return data that we want to use lives
99:23 - and I'm just is going to hit okay now if
99:26 - we run this once you will see the
99:28 - scenario is running and we're just
99:30 - waiting for it to essentially complete
99:33 - okay so amazing that scenario run was
99:37 - now complete and if we looking here the
99:39 - Des description was generated this is
99:41 - looking good are based on the property
99:44 - Nam stunning one bedroom and standpoint
99:46 - Tower with one bedroom one bathroom the
99:49 - view is a City View and the address is
99:51 - flat 109 stand Point Tower this is is
99:53 - the description that was generated okay
99:56 - I'm just going to maybe move that and
99:58 - I'm going to make this wrap over each
100:00 - other so we can read the whole thing the
100:03 - stunning one bedroom and standpoint
100:04 - Tower oozes luxury with its spacious
100:06 - layout a luring City View and modern
100:09 - Decor this property located at flat 109
100:13 - boasts one bedroom and one bathroom it's
100:15 - nestled in the heart of downtown Dubai
100:17 - so this is where it gets good ious
100:19 - District known for its high-end dining
100:21 - and shopping options so that's good I
100:24 - feel like open area really found out
100:27 - about downtown Dubai It also says the
100:29 - property is conveniently minuted away
100:32 - from landmarks like the buj Khalifa and
100:34 - do buy more so again it's used AI in
100:36 - order to probably look on a map and
100:38 - figure out what is close to our property
100:42 - and those are the landmarks it returned
100:45 - we also have glorious architectural
100:46 - sites of downt Dubai a less than 15
100:48 - minutes walk from the metro station so
100:50 - we know it's close to a metro station
100:52 - making it easy to explore the
100:54 - fascinating cityscape I mean this is
100:56 - wonderful I'm so happy with this and of
100:59 - course every time we add a new
101:02 - line we'll just run it and another
101:05 - description will be generated for us
101:07 - thanks to our scenario okay so once
101:10 - that's finished running again you will
101:13 - see that has been generated pretty well
101:16 - if I might add now for those of you who
101:19 - cannot use chat gp4 this is important so
102:23 - click okay uh and if we run this this
102:28 - will not work right because okay so we
102:33 - can see nothing's been added here this
102:35 - is because the object that comes back is
102:37 - actually different so when we're trying
102:39 - to put something in F and we go to
102:42 - message content so choices message
102:46 - content there's nothing here this is
102:48 - because with the method we chose the
102:51 - returning text we need lives under
102:53 - choice text so that's what I'd have to
102:55 - pick out choices text and that will now
102:58 - be filled out into here so if I click
103:00 - okay and hit
103:02 - run TDA we've missed that one as that
103:05 - has already been you know officially ran
103:08 - but we get this text right here so this
103:11 - text is what is generating using the GPT
103:13 - 3.5 to Vinci model it's not as good in
103:17 - fact I don't even know why it's this
103:18 - short but you might have to Tamper
103:21 - around with the prompt okay but that is
103:23 - just some extra information for you if
103:26 - you don't have access to GPT 4 or if
103:28 - you're watching this in the future and
103:30 - there's a completely different model
103:32 - right that has a completely
103:35 - different return object okay great so
103:40 - hopefully that makes sense hopefully
103:43 - this also allows you to kind of debug
103:45 - things if you're getting stuck and have
103:47 - no idea what any of these values are um
103:51 - for now however I'm just going to change
103:52 - it back
103:54 - so let's just copy this again change
103:56 - this back to we create chat completion
103:58 - change the model of this to be GPT 4
104:02 - again add an item roll user message
104:06 - content okay and then once again we just
104:09 - need to maybe let's run this so we know
104:13 - what comes back to us in the object and
104:16 - I'm just going to delete all that and
104:18 - this time we again need choices message
104:24 - content okay and wonderful and now if I
104:29 - just go ahead and maybe add a new line
104:31 - let's just go ahead and copy this one
104:33 - here cuz it didn't really return
104:35 - anything for us let's run
104:44 - this and amazing we get a beautiful
104:47 - description coming back to us once more
104:51 - and I'm just going to delete that one
104:52 - here maybe let's delete that whole row
104:56 - great so this is looking wonderful I'm
104:59 - super happy with this now you can
105:02 - schedule this you can schedule it at
105:04 - regular intervals to run every 15
105:06 - minutes and check if there is a new line
105:08 - added you might want to do that that
105:11 - just means you can go ahead and work on
105:12 - the spreadsheet As You Wish leaving the
105:14 - description blank and it should initiate
105:17 - every 15 minutes and just update the
105:19 - latest row once so that is something you
105:22 - can do or you can do it once every day
105:25 - you can schedule it for days of the week
105:27 - and so on okay I'm just going to choose
105:30 - for it to be on Dem mon for now so that
105:31 - we run this whenever we want great so I
105:36 - hope this was kind of useful for you I'm
105:39 - just going to show you the full thing
105:41 - once
105:44 - more
105:46 - amazing let's move
105:51 - on if in this section I'm going to show
105:54 - you how to create an event ticketing
105:56 - system with Google Sheets Google Docs
105:58 - and barcodes that's right no need for
106:01 - some fancy CRM we're going to do all of
106:03 - this just with these simple tools and
106:05 - start selling tickets to events at scale
106:08 - with little to no teams behind us okay
106:11 - so let's do
106:18 - it okay so let's create a scenario so
106:23 - just going to go ahead and select here
106:25 - and I'm going to choose to call this
106:28 - scenario ticketing with barcode
106:33 - automation okay so we are going to be
106:36 - using a Google sheet with some
106:38 - information order to create barcodes for
106:41 - tickets and then the tickets themselves
106:44 - so let's go ahead and do this first off
106:48 - I'm just going to select the module that
106:51 - I want to start with as mentioned this
106:54 - is going to be a Google sheet so let's
106:56 - go ahead and search for Google Sheets
107:01 - and here we are now we need to watch for
107:04 - new rows so this is going to trigger
107:07 - when a new row is added so let's just go
107:10 - ahead and add that and let's create a
107:12 - connection if you don't have one yet so
107:15 - once again if you have been following
107:17 - along with this tutorial you should have
107:19 - a Google sheet connection already
107:21 - established but if you don't here's how
107:23 - you do it so we're going to create a
107:25 - connection I'm just going to sign in
107:27 - with my Google account and it should
107:30 - bring up this little popup right here in
107:32 - which I select my account I'm going to
107:35 - choose Anna code withth anna.com in
107:38 - order to access my Google account and
107:41 - allow make to see edit create and delete
107:44 - all of my Google Drive files okay and
107:47 - especially these spreadsheets because
107:49 - that is what I want to essentially be
107:51 - able to interact with so let's go ahead
107:54 - and allow that connection let's allow
107:57 - Mick to access those files and now well
108:01 - I think we're going to have to create a
108:04 - file so let's go ahead and do that so of
108:06 - course I'm already signed into my Google
108:09 - account as you can see here there is my
108:11 - Google account and its information and
108:14 - if I click on Google apps I can select
108:17 - Google Sheets in order to create a new
108:20 - sheet so let's go ahead and do that I'm
108:23 - going to just select blank spreadsheet
108:27 - right here and let's go ahead and name
108:29 - this something as these are tickets I'm
108:32 - just going to call this tickets okay so
108:35 - just like so and let's n name this sheet
108:37 - tickets as well you can of course call
108:40 - it whatever you would like now we're
108:42 - going to have to have some rows here so
108:45 - let's go ahead and name the columns for
108:49 - these rows let's start off with the
108:51 - ticket number being number one and just
108:54 - like in real life perhaps let's start
108:56 - with let's not start with one as it
108:59 - might get confusing I'm going to start
109:01 - off with ticket number
109:02 - 2201 okay so I'm just going to pen 220
109:05 - to all these tickets 2202
109:08 - 2203
109:10 - 2204 2 05 okay and next we're actually
109:15 - going to have the row in which that
109:17 - ticket uh is assigned to let's go theow
109:21 - a b C and then let's just go a a and
109:26 - finally we're also going to have this
109:27 - seat number so again I'm just making
109:29 - these up right this is just for demo
109:32 - purposes and I've chosen rows to be
109:36 - letters just again so we can really see
109:38 - where that data is coming from all of
109:40 - these columns have a kind of different
109:43 - format to them great and of course you
109:46 - can you know stir this up a little bit
109:49 - if you would wish but you don't have to
109:51 - uh this is just for demo purposes I
109:54 - assume that if you have a spreadsheet
109:56 - where you track your ticket sales you'd
109:58 - have much more information such as the
110:01 - name of the ticket holder perhaps even
110:03 - the timestamp perhaps the price of the
110:05 - ticket there is so so much more you can
110:07 - add but of course for this tutorial this
110:10 - is the bare minimum we're going to need
110:13 - great so we have our spreadsheet made so
110:17 - let's go ahead and search by path let's
110:19 - look at my drive and now let's click
110:21 - here to choose the file
110:23 - so I'm just literally going to search
110:25 - for tickets we can search for it up here
110:29 - and there we go so we've selected the
110:31 - spreadsheet ID it is tickets and now we
110:34 - also need to select the sheet which I
110:36 - have named tickets so I can just get it
110:38 - from the drop down like so this does
110:41 - contain headers as we have added them
110:43 - here so we just want to make that really
110:46 - obvious so we ignore the headers
110:49 - row and great let's just go ahead and
110:53 - keep this as it is you can change the
110:56 - range if you want you know you can
110:58 - change it to just go up to the number c
111:01 - but I'm not going to do it I'm just
111:02 - going to keep it as it is and hit okay
111:05 - wonderful and I'm just going to select
111:08 - all and hit okay now that we've done
111:11 - that like I said we're going to use this
111:14 - information in order to create a ticket
111:17 - and a barcode so let's start off with
111:19 - making the barcode first I'm going to
111:20 - add another module here and let's just
111:22 - search for barcode simply like so and
111:25 - there we go and let's choose to generate
111:28 - a barcode now you can choose from many
111:31 - barcode types I'm going to choose to
111:34 - keep it as a QR code however you can
111:37 - have so many others okay so that is just
111:39 - something that you can do let's stick
111:41 - with QR code for now the text of this is
111:45 - going to be the ticket number okay
111:49 - because I want the QR code to be named
111:51 - after the ticket number so essentially
111:53 - after this so the first car code should
111:55 - be 20001 and we can actually also change
111:59 - the file name of this to be 20001 PNG so
112:02 - I'm just going to replace that like so
112:05 - and now the file name will be
112:08 - 21. PG or
112:11 - 22.png of the barcode itself and I'm
112:14 - just going to hit okay great so now
112:17 - we've created that barcode we actually
112:19 - need to do something with it and we're
112:21 - going to store it on on my Google Drive
112:24 - so once again maybe let's go back to
112:27 - Google so my Google account and go to my
112:30 - drive and I'm just going to create a
112:31 - folder in order to store this so I'm
112:35 - going to go ahead and create a new
112:37 - folder and let's just call this barcodes
112:39 - for now and click
112:41 - create so we have a folder called
112:45 - barcodes in here right now so now that's
112:49 - where we want to put these barcodes
112:51 - right so let's go ahead and add another
112:52 - another module I'm going to now search
112:54 - for Google Drive this time and select
112:57 - Google drive as that is where we want to
112:59 - store these files and we're just going
113:01 - to upload a file so let's select upload
113:05 - a file because once again we've created
113:07 - a barcode or a PNG of a barcode but we
113:10 - haven't really done much with it quite
113:12 - yet so let's go ahead and create a
113:14 - connection once more there's going to be
113:16 - a Google restricted connection and you
113:19 - might need to follow some external steps
113:23 - if you want to connect with a personal
113:25 - Google account to do that simply click
113:28 - on this guide okay I'm not going to be
113:30 - doing right now as these steps might
113:33 - vary in the future if you're watching
113:35 - this in the future so I'm just going to
113:37 - go ahead and select sign in with
113:42 - Google and once again I'm just going to
113:44 - select my account which is Anna at code
113:47 - withth anna.com and I'm going to allow
113:50 - this great so that is giving access to
113:55 - my Google Drive to the make app now the
113:59 - folder that we want we're going to
114:01 - actually select from a list and just
114:04 - make sure that my drive is selected and
114:07 - we're going to choose a folder I'm going
114:09 - to choose the folder that I literally
114:10 - just named called barcodes okay and the
114:15 - file I'm going to choose is barcode so
114:19 - just keep that selected and I'm just
114:21 - going to hit okay so if we run this
114:26 - now okay we will see this is running
114:29 - this is running and this is running and
114:32 - that is now completed the scenario run
114:34 - was completed if I look in here you will
114:38 - see a barcode right a barcode has been
114:43 - created two have been created so created
114:46 - this one and this one from my
114:50 - rows this is looking great so we have
114:54 - the barcodes next let's actually work on
114:57 - putting them in a ticket
115:00 - okay and in order to do this we're going
115:02 - to have to create a share link that will
115:04 - allow us to share this file to somewhere
115:08 - else so let's go ahead and do it I'm
115:11 - just going to move this over or perhaps
115:13 - maybe let's just minimize this slightly
115:15 - and move this like so and select here
115:18 - and add Google Drive again so this time
115:21 - we need to get get a share link so I'm
115:24 - just going to get a share link right
115:25 - here I've selected get a share link and
115:28 - this time again we're going to look in
115:30 - my drive we're going to look for a file
115:33 - and next we're going to find the file ID
115:35 - we can actually use it from the previous
115:37 - module right so if you look at all the
115:39 - modules here that was the first module
115:41 - we did and it's return the second module
115:44 - we did and it's return data and the
115:47 - third module is the one we literally
115:50 - just did with Google Drive when we
115:52 - upload loaded a file and that's its
115:54 - return so I'm going to choose file ID
115:57 - from here so let's just go ahead and get
116:00 - that file ID because we ran this once we
116:03 - do also get the returns of this data
116:05 - showing up here that is specific to its
116:08 - last run okay so that is kind of useful
116:11 - you might want to keep running this in
116:13 - order to get that information just so
116:15 - you kind of know what you're working
116:17 - with a lot better so let's go ahead and
116:19 - select the file ID this is a unique file
116:23 - ID that allow us to find files in Google
116:26 - Drive so that's all I'm going to do
116:29 - let's keep the roll as reader the type
116:32 - I'm going to just select anyone just to
116:35 - make it a little bit more generic and
116:37 - I'm just going to click
116:39 - okay so now if I run this we will get a
116:42 - share link to the file so in other words
116:45 - to this that was just
116:48 - created okay great one more step to go
116:52 - so the last step we need to do is
116:54 - actually create a ticket and for this
116:56 - I'm going to use Google Docs so once
116:58 - again let's go back in here back to my
117:00 - Google account and I'm just going to
117:02 - select docs like so and I'm going to
117:05 - create a blank document you guessed it
117:09 - and now I'm just going to create a
117:10 - ticket so I'm going to call this
117:13 - Dynamic
117:15 - barcode ticket and let's get creating so
117:20 - I'm going to choose to obviously just do
117:23 - this in a super super minimal way you
117:26 - can choose to do this however you wish
117:29 - I'm going to create a table for
117:31 - this let's give this
117:34 - six
117:36 - rows let's just type game one
117:41 - ticket let's also change the text to be
117:44 - a title perhaps I'm going to change the
117:48 - font please go ahead and just do
117:51 - whatever you wish I'm just kind of
117:54 - creating one that is super simple let's
117:58 - also add an emoji here and perhaps maybe
118:02 - let's Center all of this text so I'm
118:05 - just going to highlight it all and
118:08 - Center it so there we have I guess the
118:11 - header of our ticket next I'm just going
118:15 - to put some more information but first
118:17 - i'm going to split these cells out so in
118:20 - order to do that I'm going to format
118:23 - table split
118:25 - cell let's make it three columns and
118:28 - split and do the same for here so format
118:32 - table split cells let's make three
118:35 - columns and split here I think I'm just
118:38 - going to have
118:39 - Springfield bees okay so I'm essentially
118:43 - creating a fake Basketball ticket versus
118:47 - let's make another team
118:49 - Scranton bears and again let's have some
118:52 - emojis so I'm going to put a little B
118:58 - and let's put a little
119:00 - be let's also change this to be Pacifico
119:05 - let's make
119:06 - it a lot
119:08 - bigger same for this one let's go
119:13 - Pacifico perhaps let's put that on a new
119:17 - line again
119:20 - Pacifico make that 36
119:23 - we can put in a date here so let's just
119:25 - go somewhere in the future like
119:28 - 04 04
119:32 - 2025
119:34 - 7 p.m. this is our fake game of course
119:39 - and let's make this again let's make
119:41 - this all
119:44 - Pacifico let's go with
119:46 - 24 this one perhaps has
119:49 - change to be size 14 Maybe maybe
119:52 - something a little bit more
119:55 - serious so I'm going to go with that one
119:59 - again make it bold however so here what
120:02 - I'm going to do in order to pick stuff
120:04 - out I'm going to use these two curly
120:07 - braces and I'm going to find the row
120:10 - okay in fact maybe let's make this a
120:12 - little bit more serious too with Roboto
120:15 - because we're going to be replacing that
120:18 - and once again same for here we're going
120:20 - to go with seat and we're going to pick
120:22 - this out in the document and replace it
120:25 - okay so this is looking quite good I'm
120:28 - just going to mess with this a little
120:30 - bit more let's make this a little bit
120:32 - bigger let's change this to size 24 I'm
120:36 - going to just put this on a new line
120:38 - maybe
120:42 - let's move it down a little bit I'm just
120:44 - going to change how this looks a little
120:49 - bit by adding some space thing just so
120:53 - it looks like as if it's centered okay
120:56 - so again we're going to be replacing the
120:57 - row with the row from here and replacing
121:01 - the seat with the seat from here let's
121:04 - move on uh let's have some generic texts
121:07 - in here like all exits are final no
121:14 - reentry is
121:16 - permitted and
121:19 - also camera FL flashes
121:24 - may
121:26 - not be
121:28 - used at any time during
121:33 - games okay so there we go and once again
121:38 - format a line to the left and here we're
121:42 - essentially going to be putting in the
121:44 - barcode so perhaps we don't even need
121:46 - this final row let's get rid of that I'm
121:50 - just going to delete the row great so
121:54 - this is where our barcode is essentially
121:57 - going to go let's just make that a
122:00 - little bit bigger and I think this will
122:03 - look good for now I'm just going to
122:05 - paste in one just so we can see what it
122:08 - will potentially look like in the future
122:10 - and perhaps I'm just going to also
122:12 - change the page borders in order to make
122:15 - this look nice so I'm just going to move
122:18 - that up a little bit just so that it all
122:21 - fits nicely on one
122:25 - page okay so just like that so that is
122:30 - kind of the template for our ticket
122:33 - let's carry on so in here what I'm going
122:36 - to do is add another module of course
122:39 - and now let's search for Google
122:42 - Documents so let's select Google Docs
122:45 - this time and this time I'm going to
122:47 - create a document but from a template so
122:51 - it already tells you that if you want to
122:53 - replace any text you need to use these
122:56 - tags so the tags in the two cly braces
123:00 - so this module also allow you to replace
123:03 - images by new images with URLs so that
123:06 - is something that we're going to do
123:08 - we're just going to have to select an
123:10 - account so I'm going to go ahead and
123:12 - select my Google connection and let's
123:15 - just go ahead and update this CU that is
123:18 - a requirement so once again just log in
123:21 - to to your Google account and allow make
123:24 - to access your Google account this time
123:26 - to see all your Google Docs documents
123:29 - too so let's update that so I'm just
123:32 - going to click allow and great and we're
123:35 - going to select by drop- down my drive
123:38 - and now let's find the file that we just
123:40 - created so Dynamic barcode ticket okay
123:44 - and we're going to use that as a
123:46 - template we can now also change the
123:50 - title of the document itself so instead
123:55 - of having Dynamic barcode ticket I could
123:57 - change it so I'm just going to put
123:58 - ticket number and we're going to use the
124:01 - ticket number
124:04 - from collapse all these from the Google
124:08 - sheet we're just going to get the ticket
124:10 - number so just like so same as the row
124:14 - so once again I can go back to my Google
124:16 - sheet and get the row to replace the row
124:19 - and as the seat we can just get the seat
124:23 - okay great we can even replace it with
124:28 - so for example if we want some text row
124:32 - like this and then the seat just so it's
124:35 - really obvious what is going on because
124:37 - that whole thing will be replaced so the
124:39 - word seat will not exist anymore or you
124:41 - could have seat here it is really up to
124:44 - you however you'd like to do
124:46 - it great next we need the image URLs so
124:51 - so in the body image number one well
124:54 - this time I'm just going to get the
124:56 - share link right cuz we made a URL so
124:59 - we're going to get that share link now
125:01 - so let's get that share link like so if
125:04 - that does not work just make sure to
125:06 - change the share link here to the web
125:10 - content
125:11 - link
125:14 - instead wonderful and finally once that
125:17 - ticket is made let's put it somewhere so
125:19 - I'm going to actually go back in here go
125:22 - back to my drive and let's create a new
125:24 - one so I'm going to create a new
125:28 - folder and call this tickets okay and
125:32 - click create so there we go let's double
125:36 - click on here and let's see the tickets
125:38 - show up so now let's find it right we
125:42 - need to go into my drive and let's find
125:44 - that newly created folder called tickets
125:47 - and this is essentially where I want to
125:49 - save my newly created documents from the
125:52 - template so I'm just going to click okay
125:55 - wonderful so let's go ahead and run this
125:58 - and let's see what happens so of course
126:00 - we are now running this module which is
126:03 - worked we're creating a barcode we're
126:05 - uploading the file we're getting the
126:07 - share link and finally we're creating a
126:09 - document from the template that we just
126:12 - made so great the scenario was
126:15 - initialize let's see if that's been
126:17 - created and it has ticket number 2000
126:21 - three so this one right here and if we
126:24 - click on it you will see these have been
126:27 - updated so we get row C we get seat 36
126:32 - as well being updated so row C seat 36
126:36 - that is looking good and this barcode
126:39 - should be unique let's have a look here
126:42 - and it is because it's completely
126:44 - different to this one this is looking
126:46 - wonderful I'm really happy with
126:50 - this if you would like like to increase
126:52 - the quality or the scale of the image
126:55 - all you could do is need to go to
126:59 - Advanced options and you can change
127:02 - these scales so for example I can make
127:04 - it scale time 10 and if I click okay and
127:08 - run this once more so once again we're
127:10 - just waiting for the modules to complete
127:14 - and now let's check in tickets to see
127:17 - the latest document that should be
127:19 - created and that's ticket 20
127:22 - 5 and if we double click on it you will
127:24 - see the barcode is of a much bigger
127:27 - scale okay it just looks a lot more
127:30 - crisp and a lot more
127:33 - professional great hopefully you'll find
127:36 - some great uses for this uh I love how
127:39 - many tickets you can create with this
127:41 - and in general it's just an awesome
127:43 - automation to
127:48 - have now while all the scenarios so far
127:51 - far have been dealing with customers and
127:53 - clients in some way this automation is
127:56 - more for dealing with your own
127:57 - colleagues or employees I'm going to
128:00 - show you how to make some in-house
128:02 - automations so let's do
128:08 - it okay so let's go ahead and create a
128:11 - new scenario so let's go ahead and call
128:13 - this something I'm going to call this
128:15 - events from Trello cards now of course
128:19 - we're going to have to start off with
128:20 - our first module and we're going to
128:22 - start off at Trello so I already have a
128:25 - Trello account signed up to I'm just
128:28 - going to go ahead and search for Trello
128:31 - in here so here we have Trello and we
128:34 - are going to have to watch for cards so
128:36 - let's scroll all the way down here and
128:39 - we're just going to select watch cards
128:44 - okay so there we go now let's go ahead
128:47 - and create a connection so let's go
128:49 - ahead and start that up I'm going to go
128:51 - ahead and click save and it's just going
128:54 - to redirect me to give access to Trello
128:58 - so it's already noticed that I have
129:00 - signed up using Ana with codei anna.com
129:03 - so all I'm going to do is Click allow
129:07 - okay and it's going to give access to my
129:09 - whole Trello board so while that's doing
129:12 - its thing I'm just going to go ahead and
129:14 - go to Trello to show you what I have
129:16 - there okay so here is my trell account
129:20 - and I'm going to go ahead and create a
129:23 - new board I'm going to call this
129:27 - job I need to do and it's going to be a
129:32 - workspace so I'm going to go ahead and
129:34 - create that first off let's go ahead and
129:37 - create a few lists so maybe let's have a
129:39 - to-do list containing cars that I am yet
129:43 - to do and then maybe let's have in
129:50 - progress and then let's have done so
129:53 - this is just again just an example of a
129:55 - typical trailer board and what I'm going
129:57 - to do is create cards that I'm going to
129:59 - essentially move from to-do in progress
130:02 - until done so you might see this being
130:04 - used in a developer setting perhaps you
130:08 - work for a startup and you have loads of
130:11 - tasks or tickets that need completing so
130:14 - I'm going to pretend that we are a
130:16 - developer okay I am a developer or I'm
130:19 - working as part of a developer team and
130:21 - there's a card and this card says
130:25 - create button for new app and I'm just
130:30 - going to add that card so this is one
130:32 - card we have just
130:34 - created okay and we can do many things
130:37 - with this card we are going to have to
130:39 - for the purpose of the tutorial write a
130:41 - summary in here so let's go ahead and
130:44 - write a summary create a
130:49 - button for the new app that
130:54 - is aligned with The Branding
130:59 - documents okay so that is one thing
131:01 - you're going to have to do for this
131:02 - tutorial add a summary to the ticket and
131:05 - the other thing you're going to have to
131:06 - do is add a date or in other words a due
131:09 - date for this ticket so let's go ahead
131:12 - and select the 18th of January
131:15 - 2024 I'm just going to keep the time the
131:18 - same and we can have a due date reminder
131:20 - it is up to us and I'm just going to go
131:22 - ahead and save it so we've just added a
131:25 - date a due date to this ticket that is
131:27 - important and let's just go ahead and
131:29 - save it of course there are many many
131:32 - other functionalities to trell you can
131:35 - add members add labels add a checklist
131:37 - but this is not a trailer tutorial this
131:39 - is a make.com tutorial so I'm going to
131:42 - go ahead and shut that down for now okay
131:45 - so once again if you create a ticket
131:48 - just make sure that it has a summary or
131:50 - a description and a due date in order
131:52 - for our tutorial to work
131:55 - great so now let's go back in here we've
131:58 - created our Trello connections I'm just
132:01 - going to watch for all cards in Trello
132:04 - okay just to make our lives a little bit
132:06 - easier and I'm going to click okay now
132:09 - if you want it to be more specific you
132:11 - can watch out for cards on a specific
132:14 - board only in which we would have to
132:16 - pick out the board so the board I'm
132:18 - going to choose is jobs I need to do as
132:20 - that is is the one that we are working
132:22 - on here so that is an option like I said
132:25 - I'm just going to be more general for
132:26 - this tutorial and select all cut and
132:29 - click okay and let's just go ahead and
132:31 - start from now okay
132:35 - great the next thing we do is actually
132:37 - get that card so I'm going to select
132:39 - triler again and we're going to have to
132:42 - search for get a card so here we go and
132:45 - this essentially just returns a card
132:47 - back by its ID and we're going to get
132:50 - that from the first trailer module and
132:53 - we're going to search for
132:55 - data card and under card we're going to
132:59 - get the
133:02 - ID
133:05 - okay and that's all we're going to do
133:08 - and finally we have one more to do so
133:12 - once we create a card we're going to get
133:14 - the cards and we're just going to add an
133:17 - event on our Google Calendar so we're
133:19 - going to have to search for that here
133:21 - here we're going to get the Google
133:24 - connection under the
133:29 - calendar so Google Calendar and all
133:32 - we're going to
133:33 - do is create an event so first off we
133:37 - have to create that connection my Google
133:39 - connection is what I'm going to call it
133:41 - I'm going to sign in with Google once
133:43 - again you might already have this
133:44 - connection made if you have already made
133:47 - a Google connection before I'm going to
133:50 - make sure the account is Anya cod withth
133:52 - any.com as that is the calendar the
133:54 - Google Calendar I want to use in order
133:57 - to get events to pop up so let's go
133:59 - ahead and select that and this will
134:01 - allow make to see edit share and perly
134:04 - delete or calendars you can access using
134:06 - Google Calendar and I'm just going to
134:08 - click allow so I'm giving access to
134:10 - make.com for that and great my Google
134:14 - connection is now done now we're going
134:17 - to create an event uh we can do it
134:19 - quickly or in detail I'm going to select
134:21 - to do in detail and now we're going to
134:23 - have to select the calendar so this is
134:25 - the calendar associated with my Google
134:28 - Calendar here I of course signed into
134:30 - Google and under calendars you will see
134:34 - I have a few calendars
134:36 - here I have my here birthdays and tasks
134:40 - I'm just going to select to do this to
134:42 - Ana Kubo so let's go ahead and find that
134:46 - calendar ID Ana code withth anna.com and
134:50 - the event name well the event name we're
134:52 - going to get this from the actual card
134:55 - so the Trello card right
135:01 - here that comes back with get a card
135:04 - make sure get a card is the one you are
135:06 - going for not watch cards so you can
135:08 - minimize that if you want and expand get
135:10 - a card and we're going to get the
135:14 - description that we put in that card so
135:17 - let's scroll down here to get the
135:20 - description so once again this is the
135:22 - description that we will be using for
135:24 - the event okay great now down here we're
135:30 - just also going to use the due date so
135:32 - we're going to once again get the badges
135:36 - due date and the end
135:38 - date we're also going to get the badges
135:42 - due
135:43 - date so that's all you're going to have
135:45 - to do and click okay so that's really it
135:50 - I think we should give this a go so
135:53 - let's go back here I'm just going to
135:55 - create a new one let's go ahead and call
135:58 - this add header to app create the card
136:04 - once again we need to go in here and
136:05 - write down a description please create a
136:10 - header for the new app we are building
136:14 - that aligns with The
136:18 - Branding
136:20 - documentation let's also add a date a
136:23 - due date so let's go with January again
136:28 - the 19th at 6:40 and I'm just going to
136:31 - hit save okay great so that should be
136:36 - done this card has a due date it has a
136:39 - description so now if we run
136:44 - this TDA please create a header for the
136:48 - new app we are building that aligns with
136:51 - The Branding
136:52 - documentation wonderful and it's created
136:55 - at the right time the exact same time
136:57 - that the due date was added super simple
137:01 - I hope you've enjoyed this
137:03 - tutorial another thing you can do which
137:06 - is a fun one is potentially write an
137:08 - automation that will link messages that
137:11 - someone sends on a particular Discord
137:13 - channel to a Google sheet so for example
137:17 - in my own Discord Channel that I have
137:20 - for COD anna.com so this is where my
137:24 - community is and I have a channel
137:26 - specifically for people asking request
137:30 - to one of my GitHub repositories which
137:32 - is private it's a private repository
137:34 - that I have for people who are paying to
137:36 - take my course so I could potentially
137:39 - get an automation that will listen out
137:42 - for specific messages on a channel so
137:45 - here we can do it I'm going to go ahead
137:48 - and set this up now so if I create
137:51 - create a scenario here uh and then the
137:54 - first thing we're going to choose is of
137:55 - course Discord so please go ahead and
137:58 - select Discord as well and we're going
138:01 - to watch channel messages so this one
138:04 - right here that's the one that I'm going
138:05 - to choose and of course we need to
138:08 - create a connection so this is my
138:10 - Discord Channel okay I've just headed
138:13 - over to
138:14 - discord.com I already have signed up to
138:18 - this but you know the drill if you
138:19 - haven't signed up to use Discord before
138:22 - then please go ahead and sign up it is
138:23 - for free I'm just going to go ahead and
138:26 - open up my Discord so this is my Discord
138:30 - right here I actually am a member of
138:33 - many channels but the code with anna.com
138:36 - one is one that I own so I'm going to
138:41 - show you this with a completely new
138:43 - channel so that you can do the same but
138:45 - essentially what i' like to do is get
138:47 - anyone who wants GitHub access and
138:50 - message on here to be put in a
138:52 - spreadsheet for me so let's do it I'm
138:55 - just going to go down here and let's go
138:58 - ahead and create a new server so I'm
139:01 - going to go ahead and create my own this
139:03 - is going to be for a club or community
139:06 - and let's just call this demo server
139:09 - just like that and click create so here
139:13 - is my demo server of course at the
139:15 - moment there is no one here at all you
139:17 - can invite people to it you get this
139:20 - cool little link right here and then you
139:22 - can also edit the link so that it
139:24 - doesn't expire in 7 days you can make it
139:28 - either shorter or that it never expires
139:30 - so that is something that you can do
139:33 - great so this is my demo server right
139:36 - here and all I'm going to do is create a
139:38 - channel so I'm going to create a channel
139:41 - and let's call
139:43 - this access request and I'm going to
139:47 - create a channel so here we are there is
139:50 - is my channel and essentially if I want
139:53 - to you know say something like
139:58 - please write your email here if you
140:02 - would like access to
140:06 - my private
140:08 - giit Hub
140:13 - repository okay and then I can write
140:15 - that I can even pin it so for example
140:17 - pin message like so oh yeah pin it so
140:20 - that will always remain kind of at the
140:22 - top so great we have a channel and now
140:26 - let's create a spreadsheet so let's go
140:29 - ahead and do that I'm going to go here
140:31 - and I'm just going to create a
140:32 - spreadsheet like so so select
140:34 - spreadsheet and let's create a blank
140:36 - spreadsh sheeet so let's go ahead and
140:39 - call this GitHub
140:41 - requests and here I can have the email
140:45 - of the person who is making the request
140:48 - so which email I need to give access too
140:51 - and then I can have a column here just
140:53 - for me uh so
140:58 - permitted okay and we'll just put yes or
141:00 - no so once again this is super basic
141:03 - this is something that I think could be
141:05 - quite useful I can really be developed
141:07 - further as well so there we go I'm just
141:10 - making it a little bit prettier for you
141:13 - so great we have our Google Document we
141:16 - have our Discord Channel let's do it
141:20 - let's create a connection so you're
141:22 - going to have to give integram mat
141:24 - access to the Discord channel so I'm
141:27 - just going to go ahead and do that
141:29 - please do the same this popup should
141:31 - show up and you can select the server we
141:34 - know that we want it to be the demo
141:36 - server so make sure that that one is
141:38 - selected and just click continue and I'm
141:41 - just going to give access to all of this
141:43 - of course you don't have to if you don't
141:45 - want to that part is up to you but for
141:47 - this tutorial I'm going to do it and yes
141:49 - I am human
141:51 - so great that is now done its thing I'm
141:54 - now going to select the channel ID and
141:57 - it's access request that's the channel
142:00 - we want to watch and we can limit it to
142:02 - two per go uh that part again is going
142:05 - to be up to you this just means if you
142:07 - run this and there's more than two
142:09 - access requests in there it will stop at
142:11 - to so if you want you can make it 10 or
142:15 - you can just make it one each time that
142:17 - you run it again up to you I'm going to
142:21 - go ahead and do from now on and just
142:23 - click
142:24 - okay now let's go ahead and colnect this
142:27 - Google sheet so I'm going to go ahead
142:30 - and add another module and let's search
142:32 - for Google Sheets so just select that
142:35 - one and we are going to essentially add
142:38 - a row this time so go ahead and add a
142:40 - row make sure that this is connected if
142:42 - you don't have your connection set up
142:44 - and then we're just going to find the
142:46 - spreadsheet so the spreadsheet we know
142:48 - is called GitHub requests so I'm going
142:51 - to search for GitHub requests like this
142:54 - and then I'm just going to go down here
142:56 - and find the sheet name is is sheet one
142:58 - because sheet one is what we called it
143:00 - here we just give it the default naming
143:04 - and now we do have a table header so
143:07 - that is going to stay as it is and we
143:09 - can map out the values so I'm going to
143:11 - get up the object the whole object that
143:13 - comes back from Discord as you can see
143:15 - there is so so much here you get
143:18 - information about the author like its
143:19 - username you can even get the Avatar the
143:23 - timestamp of the message and so much
143:26 - more the channel ID there really is a
143:28 - lot to play around with for now though
143:30 - we're just going to get the content okay
143:32 - so that's all we're going to do and then
143:34 - I'm just going to
143:38 - essentially go back to Discord and let's
143:41 - just add an email address that I would
143:43 - like to give GitHub access to okay so
143:46 - the email of course you might like to
143:48 - you know specify like I did that you
143:51 - need to write email because essentially
143:52 - any message will get sent so that is
143:54 - just something that you're going to have
143:56 - to figure out so here is my message that
144:00 - I want to send over to here to be sent
144:04 - here and saved under this column so
144:07 - let's just send that and now I'm going
144:10 - to run this and we can look back in here
144:14 - and Ana code with anna.com was added and
144:17 - then I can whenever I get around to it
144:20 - say either this was given permission to
144:22 - or leave it blank for not yet so that is
144:25 - something that I can fill in manually
144:27 - this is just an organizational tool if I
144:30 - wanted to build this up more of course I
144:33 - can so let's go ahead and do that now
144:35 - I'm going to insert two more columns to
144:37 - the left I can also include the username
144:41 - of the user I'm just going to delete
144:43 - this for now let's turn this back to
144:46 - be yellow let's also choose to
144:51 - add a bottom border to this and maybe
144:53 - let's also add the Tim stamp of the
144:55 - request just so we know when this
144:57 - request came in so let's go ahead and
145:00 - try this again this just means I need to
145:02 - go back to here and we just need to
145:05 - adjust what we need to save to this
145:07 - spreadsheet so under email we are
145:09 - getting this however we do need to
145:11 - refresh this to get the latest Columns
145:13 - of the table so that's what that refresh
145:16 - button is for any changes will now be
145:19 - shown so there we go we've done it the
145:22 - username now shows up first then the Tim
145:25 - stamp then the email and then permitted
145:27 - so just like here username timestamp
145:30 - email and permited this is looking great
145:33 - but of course we don't want content from
145:35 - here and because we did run this once
145:37 - we're actually getting back all the data
145:39 - that is to our disposal so this is great
145:43 - so now let's go ahead and use the
145:44 - username which is author username so I
145:46 - can select that the timestamp there's an
145:49 - edited time stamp or we we don't want
145:50 - that we just want the timestamp and the
145:53 - email address well that's just going to
145:54 - be the content once more so let's select
145:57 - the content so that is now what I want
146:00 - to show up in my Google sheet we're just
146:02 - getting a little bit more data from
146:04 - Discord essentially so let's go ahead
146:06 - and click okay so we've now saved that
146:09 - let's go back here I'm just going to
146:12 - paste this once more so just pretend
146:14 - this is a fresh new email and hit enter
146:17 - and now let's run this once more as new
146:19 - data has come in and now if we look in
146:22 - here TDA we got the username is this my
146:25 - user Discord name well let's check it
146:28 - out yes it is that is looking cool uh we
146:31 - could have grabbed my avatar we could
146:33 - have grabbed all this information but we
146:34 - didn't we also got the time stamp so
146:37 - this is exactly the time stamp where we
146:39 - got this message at and then we also get
146:42 - the email address so the content of the
146:44 - message and then when I get round to it
146:47 - I can fill this out whether I've given
146:49 - GitHub access access to this user or not
146:52 - simply by going yes uh or just leaving
146:55 - it blank if I haven't yet so great I
146:59 - hope this tool was useful for you
147:01 - perhaps you can think of some good use
147:03 - cases for this for managing your clients
147:06 - for managing maybe leads as well perhaps
147:09 - you want to sell access to your GitHub
147:12 - repository uh I don't know that is up to
147:14 - you then again then you can add
147:16 - something uh more like a sales pudle so
147:22 - for
147:25 - example
147:27 - payment link
147:30 - sent
147:33 - paid and so on again this part is
147:37 - completely up to you this is more of a
147:40 - business question that you could
147:42 - probably answer
147:45 - yourself so great this is looking good
147:50 - now one thing you might have noticed is
147:52 - that the format of this Tim stamp isn't
147:54 - exactly great it's not very readable now
147:57 - you can go ahead and change it in here
148:00 - but why when you can change it on a
148:02 - make.com itself and send over your
148:05 - intended format from here so from the
148:09 - get-go so you can do this I'm just going
148:11 - to show you this now let's just work
148:14 - with the Tim stamp so let's get rid of
148:16 - these two things right here and if you
148:18 - go ahead and select the input
148:20 - you will see all these other tabs as
148:23 - well so these are showing up let's go
148:26 - into them so if I select on the general
148:29 - functions you will see some general
148:31 - functions that are available to you and
148:33 - if you hover over them it will also give
148:35 - you an explanation and an example of
148:38 - what this function is used for we also
148:41 - have some operators and keywords that
148:43 - are applicable to coding as well so
148:46 - booleans so you can essentially write
148:50 - code such as if this is true then that
148:52 - and so on we also have math functions so
148:55 - these are great for working with numbers
148:57 - where you can either round down numbers
149:00 - using math floor you can pass numbers
149:03 - you can get the max and Min of numbers
149:05 - you can get the sum of numbers and even
149:08 - round numbers as well so once again here
149:11 - we have an explanation and we also have
149:13 - some examples so for example if you pass
149:16 - through 1.2 through the round function
149:19 - you will get one and so on it is
149:21 - rounding the numbers we also have
149:24 - operators with numbers so you can add
149:26 - two numbers together divide the numbers
149:29 - and so on okay once again if you click
149:33 - on them or if you hover them you will
149:34 - get a description of what these do we
149:39 - also have functions and keywords for
149:42 - text so I'm going to show you this right
149:45 - now with the timestamp you might not
149:47 - really want to use this for the Tim
149:49 - stamp but I think let's just give it a
149:51 - go and you can apply this function when
149:53 - you need so for example the function
149:55 - length I've just hovered over it and
149:57 - seen that the function length takes a
149:59 - string of hello and tells us exactly how
150:02 - many characters are in it so let's try
150:04 - it out I just clicked on the function
150:07 - and now all I'm going to do is get this
150:09 - right here and whack it through like
150:11 - that so now let's hit okay and then
150:15 - let's go ahead and add another email
150:17 - again and send it and now let's let's
150:20 - run this so now if I go back here 32 is
150:25 - what comes back not the time St anymore
150:27 - the number 32 because 32 characters
150:30 - exist in the Tim stamp and we pass that
150:33 - Tim stamp through the function of length
150:35 - so that is my return value great so now
150:41 - let's carry on of course this is not
150:43 - useful for time stamps we want to format
150:45 - the time stamp so I'm just going to get
150:47 - rid of that wrapping function let's get
150:49 - back the
150:51 - timestamp so there it is and now let's
150:54 - go to the
150:56 - dates so the date and time is exactly
150:59 - what I would need here are my variables
151:02 - and we're going to format the date so if
151:05 - you hover over format date you can
151:07 - essentially see what the return will
151:09 - come back with this says a returns a
151:12 - date in the requested format and
151:14 - optionally in a specific time zone so
151:17 - for example we can set the format to be
151:20 - day day month month year year year and
151:22 - then the time so let's go ahead and try
151:25 - one of these
151:26 - out so if I want to set the date to be
151:31 - month day year we do kind of also want
151:35 - the time however so I think maybe let's
151:37 - go with this one right here so let's
151:40 - just go ahead and copy that we put the
151:43 - time step through first then we put this
151:47 - so let's move the time stamp
151:52 - here okay so in between this semicolon
151:57 - then we're going to do day day month
152:00 - month year year year let's also have the
152:04 - hour minute and
152:08 - then so just like so then we can also
152:11 - even add the time zone so Europe Prague
152:15 - if we wish so let's just go ahead and
152:17 - copy Europe Prague
152:20 - okay and let's just hit okay so now once
152:24 - more let's just copy this hit enter and
152:29 - run this like
152:31 - so and taada we get the day month year
152:35 - the time in a specific time zone which
152:38 - is you're Prague this is correct because
152:41 - I'm currently in Dubai and you're Prague
152:44 - is 3 hours behind me great I'm happy
152:47 - with this okay okay so hopefully you can
152:51 - have a look at some more of these as
152:53 - well we also have functions for working
152:55 - with arrays that is something that I
152:56 - didn't show previously where you have
152:59 - the functions to join you can get the
153:00 - length of items in the array you can
153:02 - slice the array so these are very you
153:05 - know JavaScript based functions and you
153:07 - can also write your own custom and
153:10 - system variables as well so a lot to
153:13 - play around with I hope you have
153:18 - fun in the section we will start off
153:20 - easy with automating responses to
153:22 - incoming emails we will set up a
153:24 - scenario that listens out to when we get
153:26 - an email into our Gmail account then we
153:29 - will use the openai API in order to
153:32 - categorize what kind of email it is is
153:34 - it request for help or is it a complaint
153:37 - for example once we know that we will
153:39 - use our Google sheet in order to decide
153:41 - what kind of response we want to give
153:43 - the email sender based on a template
153:45 - that we will write for the category we
153:47 - will then feed all this information back
153:49 - to open AI so that unique and
153:52 - personalized email can be drafted for us
153:54 - in Gmail looks good right okay so what
153:57 - are we waiting for let's do
154:03 - it okay so let's go ahead and create
154:05 - another scenario so I'm just going to
154:07 - click here and this scenario is going to
154:10 - be to automate responses to emails so
154:15 - let's go ahead and name this scenario
154:16 - I'm going to call this automate respond
154:20 - sis to emails using chat GPT and we're
154:25 - going to have to choose where you want
154:27 - to start off well of course we want to
154:29 - start off with watching out for emails
154:31 - that com in into our email address so
154:34 - I'm just going to go ahead and search
154:36 - for mail here so there it is and we're
154:39 - going to watch for emails so just select
154:42 - that one now we're going to have to
154:44 - create a connection so let's go ahead
154:47 - and click on here and the connection
154:49 - type we're going to use is Google
154:51 - restricted this is because I'm going to
154:53 - be linking up a Gmail account so I'm
154:56 - going to be selecting this one and show
154:58 - you the instructions in order to do it
155:00 - with a Gmail account however if you want
155:02 - to try another email please go ahead and
155:04 - choose from the ones below and if you
155:07 - get stuck please refer to the make.com
155:10 - documentations so let's go ahead and
155:12 - choose Google restricted I'm going to
155:15 - name this my Google restricted
155:17 - connection just like so and if you are
155:19 - having trouble with this there are some
155:21 - resources here in order to help you okay
155:25 - great now if you are using a personal
155:28 - Google account and not a work one like
155:30 - me you're going to have to follow this
155:31 - guide right here this might be updated
155:34 - at time of reading so just make sure to
155:36 - follow it through with the correct
155:40 - instructions okay great so I'm going to
155:44 - choose to save this this should open up
155:47 - this popup for me in which I'm going to
155:50 - choose my email address that I want the
155:52 - inbox to connect to and I'm just going
155:55 - to allow make to essentially read
155:58 - compose send and permanently delete all
156:00 - my emails from ANA Cod withth anna.com
156:07 - great now here on Def now here on the
156:11 - folders I'm going to choose to Target
156:14 - the inbox meaning that it is the inbox
156:17 - of my email account okay just the
156:19 - generic inbox and I can also choose a
156:22 - criteria for it to automatically respond
156:25 - to all unread emails okay so only if the
156:29 - email is unread do I want to create a
156:32 - email response for it we can do other
156:35 - stuff as in Target only emails sent from
156:38 - a specific email address we are not
156:40 - going to do that as well as subjects and
156:43 - so one okay so if you want to Target
156:46 - emails with a specific subject we can
156:48 - only respond to those or even emails
156:51 - containing a specific phrase we're going
156:55 - to leave the mark message as read as no
156:58 - as to not interfere with my inbox and
157:01 - I'm going to leave the maximum number of
157:02 - results as one as well wonderful so that
157:06 - is now
157:07 - done and let's just go with from now on
157:10 - so we're going to create a response from
157:13 - any email sent to Ana cod withth
157:15 - anna.com as of now okay wonderful
157:21 - now I'm going to add a connection so I'm
157:23 - going to add another module and this is
157:25 - going to be to open Ai and we're going
157:28 - to create a completion so we are using
157:32 - the open AI create completion in order
157:35 - for us to essentially categorize the
157:37 - kind of email that's coming in so we
157:39 - know how to deal with it so in order to
157:42 - do that we of course have to create a
157:44 - connection so I'm going to create a
157:46 - connection I'm going to call it my open
157:48 - AI connection if you have followed along
157:51 - to previous videos in this tutorial you
157:54 - will already have one here but I'm
157:55 - starting completely from scratch so we
157:57 - can do this together so I'm going to
158:00 - name my open AI connection my open AI
158:03 - connection and then this just means I
158:05 - need to head over to openai in order to
158:07 - get my API key and my organization ID in
158:11 - order to communicate with openai I do
158:14 - have a paid account so that is something
158:16 - you must keep in mind you must add some
158:18 - funds to your account for open AI in
158:20 - order to be able to use it the way I'm
158:22 - going to be using it today so let's head
158:25 - over to open AI right here all I'm going
158:28 - to do is log in so I've already signed
158:32 - up to open Ai and we want to communicate
158:34 - with it via the
158:36 - API once here I'm simply going to get my
158:40 - API key I'm going to create a new key
158:43 - let's call it test and create a secret
158:46 - key now please keep this safe as if
158:49 - someone takes this and uses it in their
158:51 - own project they can potentially rack up
158:54 - lots and lots on your credit card okay
158:56 - and use up for your token so just keep
158:58 - that safe so all I'm going to do is copy
159:01 - this don't worry I will be removing it
159:03 - so you can't use it in the future by
159:06 - simply deleting it like so and revoking
159:09 - the key so if you need to do the same
159:11 - just click on the revoke key button
159:13 - right here
159:16 - great so the API key I'm just going to
159:20 - paste in here and now we need to get the
159:22 - organization
159:24 - ID so in order to do that I can simply
159:28 - go to settings and I'm just going to
159:31 - copy this like so and then let's go back
159:34 - in here and just paste it and save so
159:38 - we've just created an open AI connection
159:41 - and now we're going to select a
159:44 - method the method we're going to choose
159:46 - is create a chat completion and the
159:48 - model please go ahead and use the latest
159:51 - model that you can I'm going to go ahead
159:53 - and select gp4 for this tutorial as that
159:56 - is the most upto-date one at the time of
159:59 - creating this tutorial for me now we're
160:02 - going to have to write a message and
160:04 - we're going to have to select a role I'm
160:07 - going to go with user and we're going to
160:10 - essentially ask open AI to categorize
160:14 - the email that's come in so in order to
160:18 - do this I'm going to literally write a
160:19 - prompt
160:21 - categorize the
160:24 - following the following email and then
160:27 - in quotation marks so just like so in
160:30 - here I'm going to get the text content
160:33 - of the email so we can get this from the
160:37 - essentially the response that comes back
160:40 - from email from the email module and I'm
160:43 - simply just going to choose to pick the
160:45 - text content so that's what I'm going to
160:48 - put in there which means that anything
160:50 - we write in the email will be input into
160:54 - here so as text in here so for example
160:58 - if we get an incoming email to Ana Codi
161:01 - anna.com that says what is my password
161:05 - in the body of the text this will
161:08 - essentially put that in the prompt and
161:10 - the prompt will read categorize the
161:11 - following email and then quotation marks
161:14 - it will say what is my
161:17 - password and then we're going to
161:19 - essentially ask it to categorize the
161:21 - following email containing what is my
161:23 - password into one of these
161:30 - categories okay and the categories are
161:32 - going to be
161:34 - inquiry or
161:37 - requests or
161:42 - complaints
161:44 - and issues now you can choose more
161:48 - categories if if you want the email to
161:50 - be more specific based on each one but
161:53 - for demo purposes I'm just going to
161:55 - choose these two and I'm just going to
161:57 - hit okay so there we go we've done it
162:01 - we'll get an email and then should be
162:03 - categorized into the two categories one
162:06 - being inquiry and requests and two being
162:08 - complaints and issues great now what do
162:12 - we want to do next well we want to
162:14 - provide an email template based on if
162:16 - it's one of the two categories so let's
162:19 - do it and this data will be held in a
162:22 - Google sheet so I'm going to go ahead
162:25 - and add another module so let's go ahead
162:28 - and find Google Sheets here from the
162:36 - dropdown and we're just going to search
162:38 - rows so let's go ahead and select search
162:43 - rows and before we do that we're going
162:46 - to create a connection but not before
162:48 - actually create creating the Google
162:50 - sheet first so in order to do this I can
162:54 - essentially just get up my Google Sheets
162:57 - so if we go here I am of course logged
163:00 - into Google so I can just simply click
163:03 - on here and select on sheets and then
163:06 - let's name this sheet something so I've
163:08 - just created a blank Google sheet which
163:11 - I'm going to name responses and in here
163:15 - we're going to create a column called
163:17 - category and then we're also going to
163:19 - create a column called prompt and we're
163:21 - essentially going to provide a prompt
163:26 - based on what kind of category the email
163:28 - belongs to so like I said the first one
163:31 - is
163:32 - inquiry or
163:36 - requests and the second one is going to
163:38 - be complaints and
163:41 - issues okay so those are the two
163:44 - categories that we discussed of course
163:46 - you can make this look as nice as You
163:49 - Wish by kind of styling this up slightly
163:55 - so just like so and once again this is
163:58 - the first category and this is the
164:00 - second category and the first prompt
164:02 - that we want to write for if an email is
164:05 - an inquiry request is going to be the
164:07 - following so I'm just going to paste
164:09 - this in like so because we can
164:12 - essentially go through it together so in
164:15 - quotation marks I've essentially written
164:17 - a prompt to give open AI if the email
164:21 - receive is an inquiry or request and the
164:24 - prompt reads provide an email reply to
164:27 - this inquiry request with all the
164:29 - relevant information that has been
164:31 - requested use this email sample as
164:34 - context when drafting your reply so we
164:36 - are essentially teaching openai how we
164:38 - want our response to look uh it's going
164:41 - to have a subject re request for
164:43 - technical support and if the customer's
164:46 - name is you know detectable we'll put d
164:49 - customer's name and again this is just a
164:52 - suggestion to open AI so the suggestion
164:54 - we have given is thank you for
164:56 - contacting our technical support team
164:57 - about the issue you're experiencing with
164:59 - product or service name we understand

165:50 - regards technical support specialist
165:52 - this is the emo okay so I'm going to
165:54 - show you how this works this is great
165:56 - for example if someone Emil in saying
165:58 - they are having trouble with their
166:00 - password or something more advanced but
166:03 - we will see that in action next let's
166:06 - also provide a prompt for if there's a
166:08 - complaint or issue so once again I'm
166:10 - just going to paste this in like so okay
166:13 - so that is the whole thing you will see
166:15 - in a Cell by itself so that is one cell
166:19 - and this is another
166:21 - cell so in quotation marks I'm just
166:24 - going to put provide an email reply to
166:26 - this complaint issue with all the
166:28 - relevant information that has been
166:29 - requested use this email sample as
166:31 - context when drafting your apply and
166:33 - again we're going to have a subject
166:35 - complaint or issue dear customer if a
166:37 - customer name exists thank you for
166:40 - contacting our complaints team about the
166:41 - issue you're experiencing with and then
166:43 - the product or service name we are sorry
166:45 - your experience hasn't been smooth so
166:47 - far is there anything we can do to help
166:49 - with the issue best regards technical
166:52 - support Specialists or we can even
166:55 - put
166:57 - complaints specialist to train it a bit
167:01 - more specifically for if the email is a
167:04 - complaint or issue
167:07 - great so this is looking good let's go
167:10 - ahead and name this as responses I don't
167:13 - know why that didn't save and let's also
167:15 - name the sheet so I'm going to rename
167:17 - this to template
167:19 - okay so just like that and now back in
167:22 - here let's go ahead and create a
167:24 - connection so I'm going to select this
167:27 - and let's name this my Google connection
167:29 - this is the first time or to be more
167:31 - specific I'm acting as if this is the
167:34 - first time I'm creating a Google
167:36 - connection and I'm just going to have to
167:38 - sign in with Google so once again we get
167:40 - a little popup I'm going to select my
167:43 - Gmail account which is Ana Codi anna.com
167:47 - and this will allow make to C edit or
167:49 - create delete all my Google Drive files
167:52 - as well as C edit create and delete all
167:54 - my Google sheet spreadsheets so I'm
167:57 - happy with that so I'm just going to
167:58 - click allow
168:02 - wonderful okay great and now once that
168:05 - connection has been established I can
168:08 - essentially select from my drive and
168:12 - then I find the
168:14 - spreadsheet spreadsheet I named
168:17 - responses and then
168:20 - I'm going to find the sheet name which
168:22 - is templates correct because that is
168:24 - what we call the sheet down here this
168:27 - table does contain headers so that is
168:29 - correct and this time we're going to
168:32 - filter so I'm going to choose category
168:35 - cuz we're going to filter the category
168:37 - and we're going to get the text operates
168:40 - equal to let's make it case
168:44 - insensitive and then we're going to go
168:46 - with
168:47 - choices message
168:50 - content and let's also keep the order
168:53 - ascending and that is looking good okay
168:56 - so once again this is just the response
168:58 - that's going to come back from open AI
169:00 - so once open AI has created a response
169:04 - and that is in deciding if the email
169:06 - belongs to inquiry requests or complaint
169:10 - issues once again let's just make sure
169:13 - that we know what we're talking about so
169:16 - here we essentially want it to match
169:19 - inquiry requests or complaints issues
169:23 - right so one of
169:26 - these then we know which email template
169:30 - we're going to use so let's go ahead and
169:33 - press okay on that and wonderful so this
169:37 - is looking good now that we know if our
169:40 - email that's coming in is either going
169:43 - to use this template or this template we
169:46 - need to send it back to open AI in order
169:49 - to make up a unique response based on
169:51 - the template so I'm going to once again
169:54 - use open AI as my module and we're going
169:58 - to create a
170:01 - completion let's go ahead and select GPT
170:06 - 4 add a message the role of this is
170:08 - going to be the user and the message
170:11 - content well it's simply going to be the
170:13 - prompt so the
170:17 - prompt which is the this
170:22 - column and we're also going to send over
170:24 - the text content from the email so text
170:29 - content
170:31 - wonderful and let's click okay so this
170:34 - is being built out we've already got
170:37 - four modules here we have one more to go
170:40 - and that is to create a draft in our
170:42 - email address so I'm going to go ahead
170:44 - and select this select email and we're
170:47 - going to create a draft email em address
170:49 - it's the same email address so Ana Codi
170:52 - anna.com so it's the same Google
170:54 - connection is the Google restricted
170:56 - connection however this time I'm going
170:58 - to put this in drafts so let's go ahead
171:02 - and check the folders that I have
171:04 - existing in that email address let's go
171:07 - with drafts and let's add an email
171:11 - recipient I'm just going to make a fake
171:13 - one so John
171:14 - example.com as we don't really want to
171:17 - send this anywhere we just want to make
171:18 - a draft the subject well this is going
171:22 - to be the subject from the email that
171:25 - came in so let's go ahead and select
171:29 - subject you will see this is pulsating
171:30 - so we know which module this is coming
171:32 - from great the content type I'm just
171:35 - going to keep us HTML and the content is
171:38 - going to say hi and then we're going to
171:40 - get the choices message content okay so

171:48 - response that we got
171:51 - wonderful so let's click okay and let's
171:54 - run it so I'm just going to head over to
171:58 - my actual email there is currently no
172:01 - drafts in here that is good cuz our
172:04 - automation hasn't created any and I'm
172:06 - just going to compose an email to this
172:08 - email address I'm going to go to Ana
172:11 - Codi anna.com so that draft has now been
172:14 - added the subject is going to be my
172:17 - password is not working and then I'm
172:20 - just going to pretend to be someone else
172:23 - hello I have tried putting in my
172:30 - password numerous times
172:34 - and it has not worked what
172:39 - should I do please
172:43 - advise okay and let's just say this is
172:46 - from Danny Doyle okay so Danny Doyle
172:50 - just imagine Danny Doyle is sending an
172:52 - email to Anna Codi an.com the subject is
172:55 - my password is not working and this is
172:57 - the body of the email and I'm just going
172:59 - to send it so at the moment that is sent
173:02 - this is being sent to Anna at code with
173:05 - Anna so let's go ahead and run this so
173:08 - I'm going to go ahead and run this like
173:10 - so the scenario is now initialized and
173:13 - you will see it progressing slowly and
173:16 - slowly until it hits this section right
173:20 - here okay and finally that email was
173:23 - created so the scenario one was complete
173:27 - and this just means that everything went
173:30 - through
173:31 - smoothly let's have a look in here and
173:34 - Tada a draft was created in my email
173:37 - address let's have a look at what chat
173:40 - gbt came up with so like I said John
173:44 - example.com was used as the email
173:46 - address the subject is simply the
173:49 - subject that I wrote in the email to Ana

174:54 - more and put my name in here Ana Kubo
174:58 - complaint
174:59 - specialist and if I'm happy with that I
175:02 - mean that really saved me so so much

175:12 - good and I'd go ahead and send it if I'm
175:14 - happy with it so there we go of course
175:19 - you might even want to format this a
175:20 - little bit better but this is
175:22 - essentially super super ready to go I
175:25 - mean I don't think I would have been
175:27 - able to write this better
175:33 - myself
175:35 - right pretty cool if you ask
175:41 - me okay so shall we perhaps try another
175:46 - one so I'm just going to uh minimize
175:48 - that and perhaps let's try write a
175:51 - complaint so before we do that I'm just
175:54 - going to get rid of this high right
175:57 - here and click okay so please feel free
176:01 - to you know perfect this tweak it as you
176:04 - wish perhaps for the subject you might
176:06 - want something else you can choose from
176:08 - literally all the returns of the modules
176:11 - that are to your disposal once you have
176:13 - run this once you will even see The
176:16 - Return of what's coming back okay okay
176:18 - so you can use that too this might be
176:22 - quite good to run if you are a bit stuck
176:25 - just so you can see what you have to
176:27 - work
176:29 - with okay great so like I said let's try
176:33 - another one let's try and make a
176:34 - complaint to
176:36 - Anna at code with Anna let's pretend to
176:40 - be Becky Boo the subject
176:45 - is I don't like your
176:53 - platform I am sorry but I am not a fan
176:59 - of your platform I think the colors are
177:04 - too
177:07 - bright can you tell your
177:11 - UI
177:13 - team this as well as your brand
177:18 - in
177:20 - team thanks it's an odd complaint but
177:24 - you know I can't really think of
177:27 - anything else to complain about so let's
177:30 - go ahead and try it so once again I am
177:33 - sending an email to Ana cwith anna.com
177:36 - I'm pretending to be Becky Buu the
177:38 - subject is I don't like your platform
177:40 - and this is essentially the body of the
177:42 - email so let's go ahead and send that so
177:46 - that is now sent and now if I run this
177:49 - scenario once more so let's go ahead and
177:51 - run it and you'll see these steps
177:53 - working so there we go they are slowly
177:56 - working you will even see a little timer
178:00 - going off until all of it is complete
178:03 - you will see the scenario run was
178:05 - successful so great so now if we go back
178:08 - here hopefully this has recognized that
178:11 - this is a complaint so the complaint
178:14 - category should be triggered in order to
178:17 - use this as a 10 template and amazing I
178:20 - don't like your platform of course
178:22 - there's a spelling mistake there I don't
178:24 - like your platform and then what has
178:27 - chat GPT suggested as a response subject
178:31 - read feedback on platform design Dear
178:34 - Miss Becky thank you for taking the time
178:37 - to give us your feedback on the visual
178:38 - design of our platform we appreciate
178:40 - your honesty and take your opinion
178:42 - seriously we understand that the color
178:44 - scheme of our platform may not be to
178:45 - everyone's liking our UI and branding
178:47 - team strives design a platform that
178:49 - balances aesthetic appeal and usability

179:03 - comfort and satisfaction of utmost
179:05 - importance to us after all without
179:07 - losers like you we wouldn't be here once
179:10 - again thank you for bringing this man to
179:11 - our attention if there's anything else
179:13 - you wish to share or any other way we
179:16 - could assist you please do not hesitate
179:17 - to let us know best regards and once
179:20 - again I will just put Ana Kubo this time
179:23 - I'm a
179:24 - complaints
179:26 - specialist okay and then I would just
179:28 - hit send so once again how much time
179:31 - saved is that that's pretty amazing if
179:33 - you're feeling more bold you might even
179:35 - want to put the email address of the
179:38 - user in here but you know I'd probably
179:40 - refrain from doing that inless you press
179:42 - send by mistake and you haven't checked
179:44 - what chat GPT has essentially written
179:47 - for you okay so
179:51 - great once again if you do want that
179:53 - email address in here instead you would
179:57 - simply scroll down and find who this
180:00 - came from this did come from
180:03 - Anna at code withth anna.com as the
180:07 - sender so you would just replace that
180:09 - like so and hit okay okay wonderful so I
180:13 - hope you've enjoyed this tutorial I
180:16 - think this is a great one to use if you
180:19 - tweak it your liking it could be so so

Cleaned transcript:

learn how to effectively use automation to streamline your tasks both for business and personally popular Creator in Freo camp.org team member Ana Kubo created this course it covers a bunch of use cases and examples including AI enhanced email automation automating task management automating lead management and way more you'll do it all with make Who provided a grant to make this course possible have you ever wanted to learn how to automate tasks in your business so that you can free up time to take on the bigger challenges my name is Ana Kubo and I'm a software developer as well as course creator here on free cocam as well as on my own channel and I'm going to be your guide today into learning all about Automation and how to do so now usually you might see coding tutorials from me but this course is for everyone meaning that no code will be required this makes this course perfect for anyone from Founders marketers sales reps or operational gurus I'll be showing you how to make automation pipelines ranging from simple to Advanced we will also have all of these application Integrations to our disposal so as you can see there's a lot and if you have your own app you can also hook it up as well for the purpose of this course we will focus on a variety of verticals to try cover as many interest R views as possible in fact here's a breakdown of what we will be building in this course so first off I'm just going to start with an introduction in which I'm I'm going to introduce you to make.com which is where the no code automation tool that we will be using lives after getting to grips with it through a short tutorial I will then move on into talking about lead management Automation in this section I will start off with a use case for this automation so that you can get to groups with what you can do with it after understanding how lead management automation can be useful for you or your company I will then go into building our first automation pipeline which is a basic one that will essentially take your Facebook leads from a Facebook adver and put them into a Google sheet for you next we will move on to a more advanced automation pipeline in which we will collect contacts that have come to you from a form on your company website we will then take the lead's email analyze the domain it came from through a company called clearbit which will give us information about the domain name so for example if bobbyg google.com is messaging you from his work email we know that he works at Google and clearbit will allow us to get all this information about Google that will be useful to us after getting this information we will move on to put this in a CRM system and filter it based on the cloud score of the company itself and as a bonus we'll send a message to Slack to all our colleagues to let us know that a new lead has come in after that we'll move on to look at ecommerce automation starting off once again with a use case for this and leading into building an automation pipeline this one will take on the premise of you being a property company and having loads and loads of properties in a Google sheet and using chat GPT to essentially create a description of all of your properties that you can use online we will also add extra information about the property and its whereabouts thanks to providing the exact location of the property so that we can also include familiar landmarks and Metro stations in the vicinity next we will look at a ticketing and barcode automation which will use the barcode app from make.com so that you can essentially once again use a Google spreadsheet of all the tickets that you sold and generate individual barcodes for them which we will then stick into a template make on Google Docs so you can automatically create a unique ticket with a barcode for all of your ticket purchases after this we will move on to an inhouse automation so far we've been creating automations that help us either get new clients or work with existing clients outside of our company well I'm going to show you how to create an automation that will help you deal with the admin internally too so for this example I'm going to show you how you can automatically create Google calendar events from Trello as well as go into a use case for why this might be useful and finally we will end with an automation that tells more into AI this is a fantastic one I don't want to reveal too much but essentially it's going to use chat GPT or another words the open AI API in order to produce unique and very real responses to emails of a certain category okay so make sure to stay tuned for that one at the end we'll be doing so using mate.com as our no code automation tool in order to build out our automation pipelines to follow along with this tutorial you can use the link in the video description below to create a make.com account with a higher level of access than normal just go ahead and click on it now and let's get going so what are we waiting for let's do it first off I'm going to show you how to get started with the automation tool that we'll be using today okay so we're going to start off on the make.com website and we're going to get started for free so just go ahead and click here you won't be asked for any payment and I'm just going to choose to sign up with Google you can of course choose to sign up however you wish there's an option to sign in with Facebook GitHub and of course just using your name and email so there you go just choose the one you prefer agree to the terms of service this part is optional you can choose to sign up to notifications and emails if you wish about the latest and I'm just going to sign up for free after checking that I am not a robot and there we go so great first off I'm just going to select the role which best describes me I'm going to choose development and engineering and then what do I want to automate well we're going to be automating a bunch of things however we are going to start with lead management first so I'm just going to select that one and let's start with having no experience at all the company size is just me and then I'm just going to select YouTube as the way I heard this and great so now let's get started so here we are we are now on the dashboard that's going to allow us to create a lot of scenarios in regards to automations and allow us to run them you can of course upgrade if you wish our current plan is the free plan it will just allow us to have more operations build more apps have an unlimited number of scenarios 40 minutes of scenario execution time we can also increase the file size that we work with and then also have access to 300 API endpoints as well it's only $9 a month so please go ahead and sign up to that one if you want or you even have the pro version which elaborates on the plan before as was a team version also Enterprise version as well so those are the options you have like I said we are going to be working with the free package don't worry we want to go over the maximum amount of active scenarios that we're going to build great so let's go back we currently have no active scenarios however we are going to build them out and we're going to do so soon we are also able to create a team so I'm not going to be doing this for this tutorial but when you grow your organization so that you know you add more team members you would create a team first and then you can also add users to that so like I said I'm the only user here at the moment you can invite other users to your organization but that is something that we will not be doing in this course wonderful let's continue now let's create our first scenario and to do that we can actually click this button right here and here we are we are now ready to create our first scenario when working for yourself or a small to mediumsized business automating the first interaction to a potential customer or client can be a huge resource saver by this I imagine Stella and her team are looking to spread the word about a new tool that is useful to software developers she advertises on Facebook or LinkedIn to collect leads to see who is actually interested in the tool St can then automate a message or even a custom message if she wants to the hundreds and hundreds of leads or even have chat GPT WR them for her this would happen in seconds as opposed to days if she chose to type out the messages herself and not only that she can automate the admin for organizing these companies within her company too whether she's using Google Sheets or a CRM like HubSpot there is so so much more she can do I'm going to show you a few of these things now okay so let's get building Facebook leads ads are one of the most popular and important ad products that companies can lean on today by leveraging the mobile friendliness and advanced targeting features Facebook leads ads provide both small businesses and large companies can connect with their audiences to give them the information they want and generate qualified leads all at once Facebook leads are CAU through forms so form submissions on Facebook and in order to get those we're going to have to actually create that form on Facebook through their ads account with an active campaign driving our audience to the lead forms let's have a go at doing that now so all I'm going to do is head over to the ads account so ads manager account for my business account it should be under the URL ads manager. facebook.com ads manager okay and if you hit enter it should take you to the fourth thing now I'm just going to create a campaign and it's going to be for leads and I'm just going to click continue okay so here we go we have a new leads campaign I can choose what this will advertise as I run code with anna.com I'm selling courses on there so I'm going to go with employment as my course will help you get employed as a software developer the country I've chosen is United Kingdom and you can choose to add all these things I'm just going to keep it super basic for now and click next great we want to generate leads by asking people to fill in a form using instant forms so that is the option that I'm going to choose make sure to agree to the terms and conditions just like so and once you've accepted the meta leads adds terms for this page you should be good to go great I'm going to maximize for number of leads the these are all optionals so I'm just going to also set a budget and schedule like so I'm not going to set an end date again these are all up to you I'm just going to leave everything very basic like this wonderful now you must select an Instagram page for this to work on I'm just going to choose my Instagram account and I'm going to choose a template for us to work with as once again I'm just going to keep this very very basic so we're just going to collect quick and easy information including the contact information of the person so the full name the email address and the phone number so that we can contact them you can customize it if you wish so for example maybe let's change the full name to code with Ana leads and the form type you can also customize your form depending on the goal of your lead generation campaign again we are not doing a Facebook tutorial so I'm just going to keep this very basic and create the form and then we're also going to add a link it's going to be to code with anna.com this is because a privacy policy exists on code withth anna.com okay so if you go to the actual website and scroll down you will see a bunch of legal stuff right here so make sure to have that too great we're also going to have to add a link here this is simply to my website so the call to action is to view the website as well and this is after our form is submitted so let's create the form wonderful another thing we can do is just change the visuals on this which might be a nice thing to do so let's go ahead and strategy when creating your own okay great so this is looking good I can also choose to review the advert this will take you to a form on Facebook which is exactly what we want we want the form to be filled out and captured by Facebook which we will then learn to manage elsewhere soon but this is looking good for me so I'm just going to hit on publish and wonderful that is now publishing my advert my form capture advert and that's now been published it is currently processing so we're going to have to check back to see what this looks like soon for now let's continue making our scenario so now as you can see here I'm going to go back to make.com and let's continue so the first thing I'm going to do is choose a trigger that will kick off our scenario that trigger is going to be the Facebook lead next we're going to choose an action that will follow after the trigger and then following that we're going to decide where we want our Facebook leads to go to I'm going to choose a Google spreadsheet and then we'll test our scenario and choose to activate it if we wish so let's do it so I'm just going to click here and then we're going to search for Facebook just like so and we're going to select Facebook leads ads okay and we're going to set the trigger as being a new lead so it will trigger when a new lead is created great now we're going to going to create a web hook so we're just going to click on create web hook and we can keep it as it is or you can change it if you wish and we're going to create a connection so that is now making a connection from my Facebook to make this may take a while because some Partners may take a while to reflect this change so let's go ahead and click save and then this should take me to this popup you might have to allow popups if you're not seeing this and I'm going to continuous Ana so my Facebook login as you saw we're already logged into Facebook which is why this is showing up as so and I'm going to allow access to be made from make to Facebook great so now that's waiting for authorization and wonderful I'm now going to select the page I want to connect to and it is code with Anna so that is looking good the form it is code with Ana leads as we named it in the ads manager and I'm just going to click save great I'm actually going to go ahead and select all the fields like so and click okay great so our trigger is now chosen let's continue so now I'm just going to head over to Facebook and we just need to allow access to people so I'm going to select on myself and all I'm going to do is essentially select the pages and I'm going to allow myself access to manage leads including download leads and create leads as and more and save so just make sure to essentially do the same okay wonderful so once that is done let's go back in here and now I'm just going to run this and the scenario run was complete so some data has come back we now need to put it in a Google sheet so let's go ahead and find Google Sheets I'm just going to select that module and we want to essentially add a row so I'm just going to drag that over and connect it and create a connection I'm going to leave this as my Google connection of course you can call it whatever you wish and I'm just going to sign in with Google so that we can connect to Google Sheets I'm of course going to select Anna Codi an.com as that is the Google account that I want to give access to make to and once again I'm allowing make to see edit create and delete all my Google Drive files as well as see and edit create and delete all my Google Sheets spreadsheets so just go ahead and do the same if you're of course comfortable with that so I'm going to click allow and great we've created a connection now we need to actually go ahead and create that Google sheet so let's go ahead and go to Google Sheets and all I'm going to do is essentially create a blank spreadsheet so let's go ahead and click here and then I'm just going to name this something let's go ahead and call this Facebook leads you can call it or whatever you want and we also need to name the sheet as we will be picking that out so I've named it leads and then we're going to choose the method to be the same and the drive well it's going to be my drive and here I'm just going to find that spreadsheet so let's go ahead and search for Facebook leads and of course select the sheet so the sheet name will be generated for you we only have one so let's go ahead and select leads just like we have named it here so there we go I'm going to keep table headers as no as we don't have any and the column range I'm just going to go A to Z as we won't have many and here we're just going to pick out everything from the object that we want because we round this once the object does have some values so this is great for us as we know what's coming back so I'm going to go ahead and select a few of course we should probably have the lead ID so I'm going to go ahead and select that I'm going to also select the form ID uh I'm also going to select the full name of the person who has emailed in as well as the email and we can have whatever we want as I said I'm just going to stick phone number in there too and let's go ahead and choose is organic that's another one that I want and let's have the ad name and let's also have the campaign ID and that's it okay so now let's run this however because it might be slightly difficult for us to ass essentially you know fake someone signing up to our form right now and getting a lead what I am going to do is actually choose where to start this so what I'm going to do is just right click on here choose where to start and I'm just going to do all so all of all time all my leads of all time of this campaign this very short campaign are going to be caught so now let's run this and amazing so that has now worked and if we look in here we indeed get the leads so there we go you can add a header of course so it's more obvious what these fields mean so I would suggest doing that because you know otherwise this information can be quite confusing to someone who didn't set up the automation themselves as we just did because of course we know what all of these columns are for so again I would suggest doing that but you can do that by yourself I hope you you found this useful I certainly did and this is certainly something that I will be using for my own business okay so let's go ahead and create this automation I'm going to go ahead and create a new scenario and first off we're going to use a web hook and this web Hook is essentially going to listen out for interactions on a live website that website is going to be one I have previously made using wix.com okay and it's a website for Real Estate it is a real company and I'm going to be using the contact form in order to trigger something happening so let's do it let's go over to the website that I have previously made this is the website again it's just one for managing Airbnb Properties or for renting longterm ass short term or if you have a property you want to manage this should cover it and here is the contact form okay so we're pretending to be this company it is a live company that has launched on thre hogan.com and we essentially want to collect leads straight to a CRM system so what's going to happen is a contact is going to leave a message for us so for example Dany who works at Google would fill this out and this would trigger our web hook which will then trigger clear bit another module we'll be using in order to essentially get information about the company that that client is emailing from so for example if the client used the email address with the domain google.com obviously Google is a big company so there's going to be a lot of online data on this clearbit will find out all the information about that company so in other words Google and then we will also filter out the data and put that lead into HubSpot so our CRM system so that the three Hogan staff can essentially manage it from there and we can even send off messages to a slack Channel if we wish okay so let's do it I'm going to pretend I am the developer working for three hogan.com and I'm going to need wix's access so let's go ahead and head over to Wix Wix is just a website builder that I use to create this website so if you want to use it please go ahead just make sure to actually have your site live so just like this one right here that is important for this tutorial okay so here is what it looks like behind the scenes we can edit the website like so and I'm just going to scroll all the way down to the bottom where the contact form lives so here it is you can simply add your own if you don't have one by going to contact forms and dragging one over okay so for example we can put in another one if we wish just like this okay however we're not going to do this I'm just going to delete that because we already have one here so making sure the Wix form is selected I would simply go to form settings and we're going to head over to automations so just click on that and view your automations so this should take you to this dashboard we give view any automations that exist and now we're just going to scroll down and we're going to create an automation so go ahead and click create automation these are the popular ones however we are going to start from scratch so just make sure to click start from scratch and we're going to choose an app to trigger so that is the Wix form as we saw here Wix form so let's go ahead and select the Wix form now I'm going to select the trigger on when the form is submitted not for when a choice has been selected on a form and we can choose which form to trigger this automation so I'm going to be specific and say it's the contact form that I want to essentially trigger this automation so if someone submits a form on the contact form this should happen and I don't want to limit the frequency and once that is done we're just going to send via webbook so that's what we need and next we just need a Target URL and we're going to send all the keys and values okay you can see the structure here of what we will send over or in other words what we want to send over to our web hook okay so let's go ahead and do it let's create our web hook so I'm just going to search for web hooks from the dropdown there we go and we're going to create a custom web hook so make sure to select custom web hook that triggers when web hook receives data and now we're going to essentially create a hook so let's go ahead and select that you can choose to name this whatever you wish I'm just going to leave it the generic title that it gave me we're not going to put in any IP restrictions okay or essentially leave it empty if you don't want to check the IP address and I'm just going to hit save so great so this is the target URL we need I'm just going to copy all of that or you can copy the address to clipboard and now let's go back to our automations and put in the Target URL like so okay so essentially we're going to be sending that form data to this URL or in other words sending it over to our web hook which lives on make.com and let's just activate this great we can give this name I'm just going to call this leads and save it so that we know which web hook we just created and there we go there is our web hook you can also view a summary at the moment there would have been zero triggers but of course we're going to trigger that now so let's do it so let's go back to our form I'm just going to clear any caches in case there is some old data here so clear browsing data clear data and let's go back and let's just go ahead with Bobby last name Brown email is bobbyg google.com so Bobby works at Google and he's using his work email essentially which is why it's got the at Google domain here and then we're just going to put hello Hogan Holiday Homes I am looking to rent a two bed for one month okay so that is the message that we're going to send and I'm just going to hit submit okay it says thanks for submitting so we have sent that over let's check if it worked so if we go back here and great that has been successfully determined that is working so let's click okay if you also want to check you can go back to your automations on wix and you can view the summary and you should see that it has been triggered a total of one times that's correct because we did send over a form submit just once so this is looking good everything is aligned so great we can get rid of this now wonderful so now that we have our web hook hooked up as send you to our form on three hogan.com I now need to send that form data so in other words Bobby his first name his last name and his email address so bobbyg google.com over to clear bit so we can analyze essentially the domain name from which this was sent from so I'm going to add another module and I'm going to search for clearbit Okay so clearbit is here and we're going to essentially get a company so great but of course we first need to establish a connection so clear bit essentially looks like this it is a great B2B data platform that you can sign up to that essentially gives you information on companies like I just said so you can get a lot about a company and the data you can get I'm going to show you so first up we just need to essentially sign up to this so I'm just going to go ahead and log in you do need to sign in with HubSpot so if you don't have a HubSpot account please go ahead and sign up to one so HubSpot is again the CRM system that we will be using today and once again you can just sign up or get started for free I already have a HubSpot account so I'm just going to log in I'm going to sign in with Google and here we are okay this is essentially my account I've just kind of put in my company details such as you know the company name is three Hogan and I have my username and password and so on and essentially what we want to be doing is adding contacts to the contacts lick here at the moment there is no contacts okay but that is something that we're going to add so once you've signed up for hopspot you going to go back to clear bit and sign in with HubSpot so I'm just going to go ahead and click that and this is connecting clearit to HubSpot I'm going to choose the account like I said the account is three Hogan cuz that is the one that I just created on hopspot I'm going to choose the account and I'm going to click okay and great so like I said this is just linked to my hopspot account and now what I need to do is essentially connect clear bit to here so let's create a connection I'm going to just leave this as my clear bit connection and it needs an API key so I'm going to show you how to find this so the API key well it's actually taken from the clearbit API documentation so I'm just going to go to dashboard. cit.com slocs in order to get essentially my API key so let's do it I'm just going to scroll down authentication is done via your account API key which is and this is unique to me so I'm going to copy this okay if you need need to see your API Keys just go to the dashboard here and here again is your secret API key so if you need to change it or get it a vote please do contact clear bit okay because you want to keep that safe so now let's go ahead and whack that in like so and save so now in here we just need to feed in whatever company we essentially want to get more information about and in order to do that well we're going to use the data from the web hook correct and I'm going to use the email address so under the contact I'm going to get the email okay so this should come back with essentially Bobby at google.com correct but we just want the google.com part so I'm going to essentially write a function for this I'm going to use get open up my parenthesis I'm going to do split open up my parenthesis again wrap this in parenthesis twice but right before this one I'm going to use a semicolon at and then after the second one I'm going to do semicolon 2 okay so this is let you split out the domain name from the email address so anything after the at sign will get put into here okay wonderful great and that's really it so I'm just going to click okay and let's go ahead and essentially run this so now once again this is waiting for the data right so let's go here and this time I'm going to put Sandra Sue email Sandra google.com hello I have a property I would like you to manage and submit okay so that data was finally sent over and the scenario was finalized and the scenario run was completed so if you click on here you will see the data that comes back from clearbit okay so once again this data is simply Sandra's information okay we have Sandra woo so under here we have a lot of context we just want essentially the contact so the name Sandra Sue the email is Sandra google.com correct and a bunch of information we even get over the message if we need it and here of course we've split out google.com from the email address correct and this is the output so essentially we have the legal name of Google which is Google LLC we also have the domain name and we also have the aliases so all the aliases that Google owns this is pretty cool information all the sites and phone numbers and emails attached to it which at the moment for google.com is none a description of the company the year it was founded the location the time zone even which we will be using it's logo Facebook handle I mean this information is just incredible so let's go ahead and use it right and we are going to use it in order to create Roots so once again I'm just going to shut down clear bit I'm going to shut down clear bit here and shut down Hobs spot we're going to keep three hogan.com and let's continue so let's add another module and I'm just going to add a router so under flow control we can select router like so and it will split off in order to create two Roots however we're going to add another one so so let's just go ahead and click on it again and three Roots will now appear so essentially what these roots are going to help me do are filter out the data that comes back from Clear bit about the company and we are going to do that by writing specific conditions that must be met in order for the data to pass through so if I go ahead and click on here we can set up a filter in order to do that so I'm going to call this filter continent equals America let's say the employee count of the company has to be larger than 100 and category we are going to put as software okay just as a reminder of what this route is all about because that is essentially the filter we're going to set up so in other words we want the company to be based in America to have an employee count of over 100 and for the company category to be software for example okay so perhaps as a property company we want to Target people in America that work for a company that has over 100 employees so they have a lot of income and maybe even work in software as that is a high income field this is just an example of course so let's go ahead and write a condition so for that I can for example choose a time zone and I can choose contains and make it case insensitive and if I put America this means that if the company that comes back from Clear bit contains the continent of America as the time zone so as you can see here from the one we just received Google under time zone it does contain America it also has Los andeles in there but because we're using the operative contains it's just going to pick out America and allow it through this filter great so that is one condition but let's create the others so I'm going to use the and and Rule and here let's work on the employees so what I'm going to do this time is Select employees because I know that's something that comes back from clearbit which is a great stat to have so let's just go ahead and find that metric here so under metrics we can find the employees so just going to select that you can use maybe market cap you can use annual revenue instead it really is up to you and I'm going to use a text operator of greater than okay and I'm just going to stick 100 so that's our second condition of course Google meets both of these it's in America and it's definitely got over 100 employees so let's create the third now the third criteria that I wanted to pass or in other words the final condition is the industry so let's go ahead and select category industry and we're going to have it contain case insensitive software right so let's go ahead and find contains case insensitive software so this just means that even though software is spelled with a capital S here and a small s here it doesn't matter it will still get filtered through so great those are my three conditions so wonderful let's see if this works let's see if the filter catches it so once again I'm just going to run this and of course we need to submit a form so this time let's put zavier zoo zavier at google.com hey do you have any shortterm rentals in Dubai and hit submit okay so amazing that should get picked up and it does so if you zoom in here continent equals America employees over 100 category equal software that's just the label we gave this router and let's now send it somewhere and we're going to send it to HubSpot so let's go ahead and search for HubSpot I'm going to search for HubSpot CR M and we are just going to essentially create a contact so let's search for create a contact I'm going to select that wonderful and let's create a connection so I'm just going to select this right here I'm going to choose to leave this as my HubSpot CRM connection and hit save and now it's just going to take me to log into HubSpot so contacting HubSpot from make so it's trying to make a connection we're going to choose the account so it is through Hogan that is the account that we made for our HubSpot account I'm going to choose the account and I'm just going to allow make to manage and view our CRM data and we're just going to tick on here to accept those terms and conditions and we're going to connect the app okay wonderful so that's waiting for authorization and that's now done we're going to now leave the view method has come back and we're going to add the properties because we're essentially going to get that information that comes back from Clear bit and also comes back from the web hook in order to put it in the CRM system so let's go ahead and add this and I'm just going to put the key as let's go with first name and the value of this we're going to not get back from Clear bit but let's get it from the web hog so from the form submission so let's go under contact let's go under name and I'm just going to select the first name great let's add another one so this time also I'm just going to select the last name so let's go with this and once again I'm just going to from the web HW get the contact name last name and there we go let's add another one so we've got the first name we've got the last name being saved on the hotspot we have also all of these other properties to our disposal so it really is up to us whatever we want to choose let's go ahead and put the company name okay so this time I'm going to get this from Clear bit let's get the legal name or you can just choose the name that is up to you let's also perhaps get this person's email address because we probably want to keep that right so let's find email address and this time once again I'm just going to go back to web hooks and get the email address okay wonderful so this is looking good let's add a few more let's also perhaps have the annual revenue I think that's a good one and I did see that on clear bit so let's go here and this comes under metrics so let's find metrics annual revenue okay and we can keep going and going but another good one to have is I'm just just going to show you this now the score of the company or as HubSpot likes to call it the clout score okay and the value of this because it is you know a company with over 100 employees in the software world I'm going to manually hard code the cloud score of this so that in hubs but issues up as hot and as the clout score I'm just going to put 10 okay and I'm just going to hit Okay so let's go ahead and try this out right so once again we're just going to use Google uh as the example because we want to essentially see if it filters out so let's try it out I'm just going to run that and now it's waiting for the data and let's go ahead and go with Gary ggar google.com do you have any Studios to rent in Dubai for shortterm submit okay and the scenario was completed that is good and amazing so this has worked it seems to have got to the correct spot and it is from Gary okay we've got the email domain so now if we go to HubSpot I'm just going to log in I'm going to sign in with Google and once again if we now look in in contacts we should see Gary there so contacts and there he is Gary G we even get a little icon of Google that's where he works we get his email address okay and as well as when this was created we get two sample contacts from HubSpot 2 and if I click on Gary it's basically got all the information that I sent over that is necessary for my company okay and to be fair we just sent over the first name the second name the email address and the cloud score so this is looking wonderful I'm just going to do one more thing so now that we're getting Gary in there I'm just going to shut that down we also want to notify everyone at three hogan.com so everyone in our company that we've got a new lead and because we use slack there I'm going to send that over to Slack so I'm just going to add another module I'm just going to zoom in so you can see and click here and now let's search for slack so here we go and we are going to create a message so let's go ahead and find create a message and there we go and now let's create a connection so this connection timee is going to be for a slack user let's name it my slack user connection or you can name it whatever you wish and I'm just going to hit save and this would essentially prompt me to log into my slack Channel okay as I already have one it's a slack Channel called three Hogan you can add another workspace if you wish I'm going to keep it on that and I'm just going to allow this so I'm allowing it essentially to send messages to three hogen which is a slack Channel that I have made so we need to enter the channel name here I'm going to enter it manually so I'm just going to head over to slack and here is my slack username so three hogan. slack.com and now it's asking me for a channel ID or name so if we go back to slack I can create a channel so let's go ahead and do that I'm going to create a channel I'm going to call it q1 leads so that is the name of my channel I'm just going to hit next I'm going to make it visible to anyone in three Hogan so let's go ahead and click create create and I'm going to automatically add anyone who joins through Hogan so there we go okay q1 leads is now here great so now I can put q1 leads and as the text I'm going to put you have a new lead lead email address we can even put on hub spot so people know where to go and then here we can put the lead address essentially we can take it from HubSpot so right here we can even have the clout score so that people know this is a good lead that they need to follow okay so here's a clout score I'm just going to put that here and I'm just going to put clout score and really that's it so let's go ahead and click okay so now let's try this one more time so I'm going to run this and we can wait for new data so now it's waiting and I'm just going to go with Fred fee Fred google.com and hey any need two beds for me and I'm just going going to submit so now if we look in here it's accepting the data waiting for the data and as soon as it gets it hopefully we should get a slack message so boom and now if we look in slack amazing we have a new lead on HubSpot lead email address and the cloud score of 10 as of course we hardcode a 10 as a cloud score for Google so amazing this is incredible I'm so so happy with this we do have a few more things to do and that is fill out the other Roots but it's just going to take the same steps that we took previously so this is a bit of great repetition for us so let's do it so let's write our second route so I'm going to set up a filter for this this time let's do continent America employees maybe smaller than 100 category software okay so we know what to do the condition for this we're going to use time zone and we're going to do contains okaye in sensitive America and another condition this time for the employee count so let's go ahead and find the metrics once more and find the employees and let's say they have to be lower than so let's find less than 100 okay and add one more rule let's have the industry so industry here again contains case insensitive we're going to go with soft where and great so that is our second scenario we can even move this out a little bit if you want to read and now let's do our third one so this is essentially just going to take anything that doesn't fit the ones above so let's just call this all else okay so now I'm just going to once again add HubSpot CRM and we're going to create a contact so this one right here compact we're going to keep that the same once again let's have first name so I'm just going to search first name and we'll get this from the email contact so I'm just going to get name and select the first name and let's add another property the key for this is going to be last name and we'll have the last name from the custom web hook we're also going to get the company annual revenue we're also going to get the company name so let's go ahead r that and this comes from clearbit and let's get the legal name we'll also get the email address so let's go ahead and get the email address from the web Hook Once More so let's find email and I think we said we would add the annual revenue as well and again this is from Clear bit so I'm just going to get the annual re Vue which is a metric that should live down here so annual revenue and we've got our custom one which is the clout score as well so let's go ahead and search for clout score and this one let's maybe give it like a seven okay great and finally I'm just going to add the last one too so HubSpot CRM create a contact it's just going to be the same so so this is for essentially catching everything that the filters don't catch because the clout score we're going to give it uh slightly different right so first name let's get from contacts name first let's also have last name last name let's also have the company name and as the value we'll get this from clearbit the legal name let's also add the email address so I'm just going to find the email and this will come from the web hook so let's get the email let's also get the annual revenue which lives in clearbit so again this is in metrics annual revenue and our custom one which is the Cloud score so let's search for cloud score and I'm going to give this a two value and click okay and now for this slack integration so for this perhaps let's copy what the text we have is here okay and let's add a module so I'm going to select slack we're going to create a message to the Channel with ID q1 leads and the text we're just going to to paste so we're going to paste that text and as the lead email address this is going to come from HubSpot we're going to find that email and we're going to also find the cloud school which was somewhere at the bottom here Cloud School general making sure to spell q1 leads just the same as here great and let's hit okay and create a message uh once again this should go to q1 leads as the text we're once again we going to have you have a new lead on HubSpot the email address is going to be the email and then let's also put the clout score here so I'm just going to scroll down to find that clout score once more there are many ways you can of course do this perhaps you want to set up a different Channel part each lead whether it's one with clout score 10 or one with Cloud score 8 or one with clout score two it is completely your choice wonderful I'm just going to save this for now so let's go ahead and test it out so I'm just once again going to run this and wait for a new data and of course we need to fill this out so I'm going to go with Anna Kubo I'm going to put Anna at free Cod camp.org and I'm going to put hello and submit and now let's wait for that to do its thing now free go camp does have less than 100 employees and it is in America and it is in software so I would expect it to go down this channel but we will see if it doesn't it should end up here with a cloud score of two so let's see which route it ends up in ah so it seem to have gone this way I wonder why that is let's have a look so freecodecamp.org it's got the description time zone is America interesting and employees is 46 so perhaps it's the industry that is making it go down this route let's have a look category industry diversify consumer services okay but if it was software hopefully it would have gone this route instead and let's just check that has worked in slack let's see the message so we should get a message at we have a new lead on HubSpot lead email address and at. Cloud score too so we did expect that that is looking good and if we look on HubSpot now we have Ana Kubo we've got the logo We've Got Annie at freeer app.org this is looking so wonderful I'm so so happy with this okay great so I hope you've learned a lot of course there is a lot of personalized stuff you can do you don't have to follow along with my strict instructions especially when it comes to the rooting part of course each company is unique so please go ahead and set up your own filters around this hopefully you should have the knowledge to do so now okay so in this scenario we're going to pretend we're a real estate company and we are essentially looking to find leads of owners of properties they either want to sell them or rent them out okay so we're going to have a for somewhere on the internet that collects their name their contact email address and the rough value of their property in order to then put all that information into a CRM HubSpot CRM to be precise okay so that's what we're going to do I'm just going to show you exactly where in HubSpot we're going to put this so here is HubSpot I'm just going to go ahead and log in because I already have a HubSpot account so I'm going to choose to sign in with Google of course please do sign up to HubSpot if you don't have an account already I'm just signing in like so and it's going to take me to my HubSpot account now in HubSpot you can collect contacts or you can collect deals so we're going to do that under sales and Deals we're going to start deals in order to take them from prospecting to finalized and closed so we're going to essentially be adding to The Columns of deal owner we have create date last activity date Clos date and a bunch more so this is what we're going to be using so let's go ahead and do it I'm going to create a new scenario and like I said we're going to be using a form I'm going to go ahead and use type form for this here it is and we're going to watch responses but we're going to choose this one so instant okay so it triggers as soon as someone fills in your form somewhere out there in the world so that's going to choose and I'm going to go ahead and create a web hook so please go ahead and choose create web hook and because I have used type form before it already shows up here so for those of you who don't have a type form account please go ahead and sign up I do so I'm just going to go ahead and log in so I'm going to choose to log in with Google please go ahead and do all the steps that you need in order to sign up or log in if you've used type form before and it should take you here okay so first off of course we need to create a new form you can do this using AI so this is quite fun you can essentially tell it what you want to create and then it'll suggest inputs and essentially suggest a form that you might need you might not even think of some of the inputs so sometimes it's fun to use this so for example lead generation form like that but I know what I want to create so I'm just going to go ahead and choose create new form and start from scratch okay so that's what I'm going to choose I'm going to call this lead generation you can call it whatever you wish and I'm going to say that this is a leaden form so I'm going to click continue now this is great because you can really go wild on designing this um we have hello what's your name so I do suggest keeping that because that is something we're going to need we're going to have the deal name in here so let's let's go ahead and keep that helloo what is your name and then someone will answer it I'm going to make this required and I'm actually going to go ahead and change the image because we're a real estate company so you can go in the media gallery and select from all the things that type form has so if I type in real estate just like so I'm going to go ahead and select this one right here and wonderful so that's just looking better to go to the next question you can simply click here the second question has given is nice to meet you and you can actually insert the name that they just answered before I'll show you how to do that how's your day going however we don't really need this I'm going to go ahead and delete it so please go ahead and do the same to add a new question though just go ahead and click here and this is lead qualification I think the next thing we should ask for is perhaps their email so I'm going to go ahead and add that here um we can go nice to meet you and then the at sign will allow us to bring us previous inputs so I can go ahead and do that nice to meet you and then whatever their name is please provide an email where we can contact you and then we have that let's also make this required so wonderful this is looking good I'm just going to add one more question and this is going to be a dropdown so this is just to get the value of the property okay so we know how much this deal is worth I guess again these questions are just for demo purposes if you have a company I would strongly suggest really sitting down and really thinking about what questions you want to ask someone but again demo purposes I'm not uh using my emotional intelligency or anything like that so I'm just going to go ahead and write how much is your property worth very direct okay and here we could just write it I'm just going to go ahead and select uh a few again please feel free to do this much better than I am uh let's go ahead and also specify that this is in us so there's five options right here so that's the three questions I'm going to have let's also make this required of course if properties is worth more it would be worth having more options and let's have an ending so I'm going to select here for an ending and I'm going to choose to have an end screen you can redirect to our URL however this is a paid feature so if you don't want to pay for it don't use that so let's go ahead and do it I'm going to go ahead and say thank you name we will be in contact soon and then you can of course choose to have these share icons I'm going to get rid of that so great now I'm just going to delete this ending as we just want the one ending page and I'm going to go ahead and publish this so that is now being published let's go ahead and copy that link to check it out so so here is my Forum this is what I would use in order to essentially share it around let's go ahead and do Ana Kubo okay uh I'm going to go with Ana at code with anna. okay and then I'm just going to select the first one and submit and great that is now finished and you can see my name is showing up this is looking cool so now let's go ahead ahe and actually use this so I'm going to go ahead and select the form ID so this should show up I'm going to refresh this there we go lead generation because this is what I called my Forum if we go back to my workspaces you will see that's the only form in here it's called lead generation so there's only one in the drop down right here and I'm just going to click save so that's really it and I'm just going to go ahead and click okay now we need to connect this to HubSpot so I'm going to search for HubSpot just like so and this time we're going to create a deal so search for create a deal and just select it from all the various things that exist now we're going to make a HubSpot connection uh of course I've already connected this to my make.com platform hence it's showing up so please go ahead and do that if yours isn't showing up and you need to set up that connction now I'm going to go ahead and map things out so the key here again this is just from the column names that we see up here I'm going to go ahead and have the should we have the deal name for the deal name I'm just going to use whoever filled out the form's first name so here because we already connected type form it's already connecting to our Forum so the first question we ask us hello what's your name then we have nice to meet you your name please provide an email and how much is your property worth in dollars so let's go ahead with the first name right because that's what we want to the value to be under deal name I'm going to go ahead and add another one so let's also have uh deal stage this time so I can actually just search for deal stage and we're just going to hard code this okay to be prospecting so this is hard coded because you know if something comes in it's always going to be fresh it's going to start prospecting and then develop to the furthest stages of the sales pipeline next one I'm also going to have is the amount so the amount here is just going to be how much the deal is worth and I guess we can have the property worth for that okay which has to be a number otherwise this will not work hence I wrote numbers when writing out my type form form okay wonderful so I'm happy with this I'm just going to select okay so now let's go ahead and do it right I'm going to run this and this is now going to wait for information so I'm going to have to go back here and then let's get the URL for this so copy link and I'm just going to paste it in here once more and this time let's do someone else let's do Bobby Brown okay and then let's do Bob BB at gmail. com okay uh let's go ahead and put this one this time and submit okay so this means that this should now run uh something did not work prospecting is not a valid pipeline stage ID so that is fine here are the valid options let's go ahead and do this here we can do qualify to buy so we can actually select that this just means that here under value I'm just going to change that to be qualified to buy and hit okay so once again so that debugging tool is really super useful let's try this once more I'm just going to refresh the form and then let's go with Ken Fang okay KF at gmail.com okay and then let's just select another value and hit submit so now that should work that has because all these bubbles have gone through we don't get any errors we don't have to debug anything even though the debugging method is quite cool that does give you a lot of information there in order to make debugging a heck of a lot easier so now under deals Tada we have Ken Fang we have the deals stage as qualified to buy because we did hard code that everyone in here is qualified to buy essentially we have a deal owner which is unassigned and we have the deal value amount great this is looking good and of course if we add more leads to this via the form they will also show up so great I hope this was useful thank you very much okay in this section I'm going to show you how to essentially filter out if leads are qualified enough so for example if you get a lead from the company apple.com so someone's emailed in with the apple.com domain you can use automation to essentially filter out if this is a company you want to pursue so for example if it's got a high enough employee count high enough market cap and so on so I'm going to show you how to do this using Google Sheets and clear bit so let's do it let's go ahead and create a new scenario for this and we are going to be using a spreadsheet so a spreadsheet of these leads it's going to have an email address it's going to have their name and then we're going to automate the others so just head on over to your Google Drive and create a sheet I'm just going to select sheets in order to do this and go ahead and select blank sheet and let's go ahead and call this leads to qualify so that we can pick it out later on I'm going to keep this as sheet one but of course please feel free to rename this if you wish this you can rename this you can rename just make sure to keep an eye on this so you don't lose track while following this tutorial so let's go ahead and first off create the table head I'm going to have email like I said we'll also have the name of the lead we'll have the lead status we're all going to start off with the same lead status for all of these at the beginning we'll also have a last scene why not the company name and let's also have the number of employees we can have the employee range as well let's also have the market cap for the company and the Alexa ranking this is going to be a global ranking of the company so for example let's go ahead and do this our first lead that we have is Michael Scott at dundermifflin paper.com and then of course let's have the name so this is Michael Scott the lead status uh we're going to have not verified and we're going to overwrite this this is going to be overwritten once we essentially communicate with clearbit and use the automation to essentially fill out this and these as well the last scene is going to be a generic date okay this is just for demo purposes so cool there we have our first lead now you you can also choose to you know let's go ahead and make this look a little bit prettier just so you can visually see that this is indeed the header this is essentially where all our leads is going to go I'm just going to make it yellow and we can also use this right here to underline it if we wish so great um I'm going to fill out a few more of these while we are here so let's have John do at integro match as a company that uh will definitely qualify I believe and let's put John do again let's put not verified and as the date here I'm just going to put that let's also have Dwight Sho at Dunder let's make sure to spell it the same I'm just going to copy that dundermifflin paper.com this does exist on clearbit uh I'm pretty sure it's just for demo purposes but still it's kind of fun Dwight Sho not verified and let's put a date for this too the next one let's maybe have the company Apple so Jane do at apple.com we of course know this is a very big company but let's see if clearbit does so once again not verified I'm just going to put a date and then we're going to see if it'll pick up Apple the company name the the number of employees it has and the employee range as well as the market cap and the Alexa ranking of apple as in the thing that makes your iPhones and so on let's also have another company Eddie Jones at chevron.com so Eddie Jones not verified and let's put a date here as well uh and one last one Jim help at Dunder Mifflin Jim Halper not verified 22 3 20 20 okay great so that is my spreadsheet please make sure to make the same as this for now for demo purposes and once you understand this scenario you can then go on and make your own so copy this pause it if you need to and once you are ready let's go so I'm just going to go back here and the first thing we need to do is of course listen out to Google Sheets so go ahead and find Google Sheets on here just like I have and we're going to watch for new rows so we're going to watch new rows this first one right here and whenever a new road is added at the moment we've added a lot of rows then this will trigger some stuff so so let's create a connection first I'm just going to select this it's going to be a Google connection that's what I've chosen to call this connection uh and this is just allowing integram mat to essentially give us access okay so we're going to have to sign in with Google this is going to take me to this popup right here I'm going to choose the account I want to sign into and then I'm going to just click continue so great make wants to access your Google account I'm going to click allow and then that should be it so now we are connected to my Google account uh we can test this out because I can select the spreadsheet ID and search for leads to qualify so this first one right here and it's found it and it also knows that we just have sheet one we have one sheet that's what we called it here so we're just picking this out out of leads to qualify great this table does contain a header as you can see here so I'm going to keep that as yes uh the res with headers are A to Z I'm going to keep that the same and I'm just going to hit okay wonderful and I'm just going to select all okay so now let's go ahead and add another module so we did say we want to use Clear bit in order to assess the person or company that essentially we're going to feed in so select get a person or company and once again we're going to have to create a connection for this so let's go ahead and create a connection now this is going to need an API key so please go ahead and head over to clear bit so here we are I have logged into this previously so here I am of course please sign up if you need to I already have an account which I've already done all the sign up process for or already so I'm just going to choose to log in uh I'm going to put in my email address here I'm just going to put Ana at code with an.com and send in a signin link so now if I head over to Gmail this time I'm just going to head over to my Gmail account of course I should see that in my email and I do so I'm just going to choose to log in okay so this is just what you have to do in order to log into to clear bit and it's going to ask you to sign in with HubSpot okay so you need to also have a HubSpot account in order to do this if you don't you'll be prompted once again to sign up to hopspot but I already do have a hopspot account so I'm just going to choose to sign in great okay so let's go ahead and sign in I'm just going to choose to sign in with Google so once again I am just going through the steps in order to sign up and then my company that I have on HubSpot would show up so here is my account it's called three Hogan it's from the very first video that we did in this course so let's go ahead and choose that account great so this app is now requesting access to my HubSpot account as well because clearbit is linked to HubSpot and once you have accepted that it will take you to this dashboard so here is your dashboard but in order to actually get the API you're going to have to go to a different URL L it's dashboard. cit.com SL API so make sure to type that out and hit enter and here is your API key okay just go ahead and copy that once again please keep this safe and if you do lose it you can get it changed or revoke by contacting clearit so great let's now go back to here and just paste in that API key and I'm going to hit save so wonderful that is now doing its thing and all we're going to do is get the email address from the Google sheet so just select email right here okay once again this has been read from this Google sheet so it's taking the columns right here as you will see make sure just to select it and don't have any other text in here and that's it just go ahead and hit okay now we're going to actually do some rooting so just find the rout under flow control and we're essentially going to write some Roots so we're going to have to Define what makes this a qualified lead okay so we can do that here we can set up a filter and let's just say that you know this is a qualified lead if let's write a condition if the company so I'm just going to go ahead and this is essentially what's coming back to us from clearbit we have an example as well that's quite nice for them to provide an example value for us so we can kind of see what's going on so there's a lot coming back from clearbit there's you know stuff under Facebook stuff under GitHub even so GitHub accounts geography this is really crazy the one we need to find however is metrics and let's just say that use the employees for this okay so let's go ahead and do that let's say that if the employees which in this case is 90 is larger than or equal so let's find that from here greater than or you can do greater than or equal to it is up to you and let's go with 50 then it makes a qualified lead okay that for us is a qualified lead of course you can change it you can put 500 in which case you're only targeting you know bigger companies than ones with 50 employees so that is my definition of a qualified read and then here is just going to be all the not qualified ones which is essentially just going to take everything else so we can just label this not qualified lead okay and I'm just going to leave it blank one other thing we're going to have to do here is just set this as a fullback and just hit okay so now here we're going to have to send that qualified lead to Google Sheets and we're just going to update a row so once again all I'm going to do is essentially pick this spreadsheet ID so leads to qualify okay that is my spreadsheet ID and then let's find the sheet name which is sheet one the row number is just going to be whatever row we're working on so it's not going to come from Clear bit so I'm going to collapse that it's going to come from Google sheet and I'm just going to select the row number this table does contain headers we do know that the email address well that's already been done as is the name so we'll keep that as it is the lead status we want to override and we're going to put qualified okay so we can put qualified there last scene we're going to leave blank once again this uses me hardcoding something and this is what's going to come back from Clear be that we want to fill in so the company what we're just is going to put the company name and that lives here so under company name let's also fill in the number of employees so once again this is a whole object right uh we're going to go into company we're going to go into metrics and we're going to get the employee count then we'll have the employee range which also lives under metrics we're going to get the market cap okay so if that exists then it will be put in there and the Alexa ranking the global ranking of the company and hit okay and now we also need to do the same for here so let's update a row this is for the not qualified leads the only difference here I'm just going to show you so first off let's actually select the spreadsheet that we need so leads to qualify and then just make sure that the sheet number is also selected and it's correct so the sheet name is going to be sheet one the row number that we're working with once again this comes from Google Sheets so we're just going to select the arow number the table does contain headers the email is going to be the same the name's going to be the same like I said this going to be identical to what's going on here apart from the lead status which is going to be not qualified and we're going to essentially overwrite the not verified here okay uh last scene we're going to leave as it is the company well once again this comes from clear bit so let's go in here uh we don't need the person we're going to have the company name for this so company name let's also get the employees which is under metrics so the employee count the employee range which is this the market cap so once again this is under metric and the Alexa ranking which is right here great so I'm happy with that let's say okay and now let's give it a whirl so I'm just going to go ahead and run this and see it completing all the steps and wonderful that is done and if we look in here so this is working let's once again run it once more so there we go it's doing its thing and great and let's run it once more and good great so we have now filled out this whole sheet this is looking good I'm really happy with this if you want to change it so that you know you can essentially limit the maximum number of results or you want all of them to run that is up to you I'm going to go ahead and change this to one and now if we add something else so let's go ahead and add Maybe these two again not verified not verified make this be Danny do Danny to and here Annie Lee Annie Lee and run this again then this time you will see just one time it has run great and that line has been added this is looking wonderful and that's it now you can go ahead and add way more leads to this if you want that part is going to be completely up to you okay so now that you know how to do this I would suggest making this by yourself from scratch changing the uh definitions for a qualified lead and a not qualified lead that could be a fun one to do in addition to you know having just one criteria in order to make this a qualified lead you can have more if you want to add more you can do the and and rule in which this has to be true and this has to be true okay or you can do it that this has to be true or something has to be true so I could say that you know either the company metrics employee count has to be greater than 50 or you know if we don't care about that we can do something else we can use the metrics annual revenue perhaps and if it's higher than a certain amount so we can do greater than you know 10,000 then it's also a qualified loot so that is something something you can also do and just have a play around with it is going to be completely up to you you can also use metrics and things that come back from the object from Clear bit that you don't necessarily use here so you don't as you notice we didn't choose to use the Alexa ranking the market H the employee range uh or the company we chose something completely all together so please feel free to have a look through all of these and you know you can use whichever one you want you can use the founding year for example too so there really is so so much you can play around with okay I'm just going to delete that so we can keep it the same for now you can also choose whether to schedule this so you can schedule it at 15minute intervals or once a day or on certain days of the month that is also a fun one and like I said if you click on here here is where you limit the amount of number of results to be work with during one cycle so that is something to keep in mind that's why we you know got two to update each time and when we changed it it was just one you can also change it if you wish great I hope that was useful for you did you know that you can use a spreadsheet that has all the information about a product to generate an SEO friendly description for example say I ran a real estate company and had hundreds of properties in my portfolio I have the property address how many bedrooms it has and the view from each one now based on just these three properties I can generate some pretty compelling descriptions to help sell my properties in under a minute including how far away the property is from a metro station what are the closest Larks to it and more I can do so using chat GPT and its access to global map features I'm going to show you how to do this next okay so let's go ahead and create a scenario so I'm just going to go ahead and do that here we're going to create a scenario that allows us to create this completions that we were talking about mainly completions to go here to fill out a description of my property based on the property name the bedrooms the bathrooms the City View and the address and we're going to use the address in order to find the closest landmarks and the closest Metro to our property using open AI so this is pretty cool obviously there is not a lot of data here as this is just for demo purposes but I hope you can imagine how useful this is when you have thousands of properties in your database okay so let's do it I'm going to go ahead and create that scenario now and we're going to add you guest it our module so I'm just going to select here and the module we're going to start off with is Google Sheets as we're going to have to pick up the data from the Google sheet first so I'm going to select watch new rows so this will trigger when a new row is added so let's go ahead and select that and I'm going to create a connection so let's go ahead and create my connection my Google connection and I'm just going to sign in with Google in order to allow make.com to speak to my Google account so I'm just going to have to sign in in order to do that and make want to access my Google account this is my Google account I essentially agree to allow it to have access to see edit create and delete my Google Drive files as well as see edit create and delete all my Google sheet spreadsheets so I'm just going to click allow in order to do that great and amazing that is now done I'm going to choose to search by path we can choose to enter manually or select from all and then I'm just going to select my drive as in my Google Drive and then we're going to have to find the spreadsheet ID we're going to do so by name so this is my properties so let's go ahead and do that I'm just going to search for my properties just like so great and now we're going to have to pick out the sheet name so there could be multiple tabs here or multiple sheet names however there is just one which makes our life a lot easier because from the drop down we could just select properties now this table does contain headers as you can see here so I'm going to keep yes in the dropdown okay and then row with headers now I can just keep it as it is or I can be super specific saying it's A1 B1 C1 D1 E1 and F1 so I've just changed that you don't have to if you don't want to I'm just going to make the maximum number of results we work with during one execution cycle one and I'm going to hit okay now when it says choose where to start I'm just going to select all and once again hit okay as well great now that we have that we're going to have to add another module so this time I'm going to choose the open AI module as we want to essentially talk to open AI in in order to send a prompt over so that's what I'm going to do and we're going to choose to generate a completion so let's select create a completion and I'm just going to move that over here so it is connected to the first module we made and I'm going to create a connection so I'm just going to have to head over to open Ai and log in so this is my open AI account I have signed up and I am paying customer so just make sure that your account is funded and you are a paying customer or if you have some free credits to use that's great for you but just make sure you do have some funds in this otherwise it will not work great now I'm just going to head over to API keys and I'm going to create a new secret key I'm going to call this demo key just like so and create it of course you know the drill please do keep this API key safe because if someone takes it and uses it for their own project they could rack up loads and loads on your credit card bill so don't share it around and in fact I am going to delete this after the tutorial is finished so please don't take mine either wonderful so we have our API key and now we're just going to paste it in like so the other thing we need to do is also pasted in the organization ID and that can be found back here here under settings and there we are that is my one right here and just paste it in like so and hit save so that connection is now done we can now communicate with open AI so now I'm going to select create a chat completion this is just so that we can use the latest model okay we're not really creating a chat we're just going to send over one prompt but if we were to choose create a prompt completion the latest model we can get only goes up to GPT 3.5 okay so there we go now if you don't have access to GPT 4 I am going to show you how to use GPT 3.5 cuz there will be one thing that we have to do differently but I will show you that in a bit for now I'm going to show you how to use chat gb4 and like I said for that we're going to have to create a chat completion and this will give us GPT 4 again we are not making a chat we simply going to send over one prompt and get a returning response so just keep that in mind now as the message well we're going to have to choose a role I'm going to choose the user so me because me as a user I'm going to be asking open AI a question and that question is essentially a request and my request is please write a description no longer than seven sentences on my property along with the nearest landmarks based on its address please also mention how many minutes work from the Metro only if it's less than 15 minutes great and now we're just going to feed in that information please write this based on the following property information and I'm going to put the property name uh and we're going to actually use the data coming back from our Google sheet okay this is the data coming back from our Google sheet thanks to the first module we made and I'm just going to select the property name I'm also going to put the amount of bedrooms and use the bedrooms column and the amount of bathrooms and use the bathrooms column we're also going to get the view which is either a City View or a c view so let's put in the view and of course the address and that lives in the address column great so that's essentially what I am sending over to open AI in order for it to make a description for us so I'm just going to hit okay now that we are essentially sending a prompt over to open Ai and it's going to get us a result we want to put it back in the spreadsheet or more specifically in this column so once again let's get a module so I'm just going to go ahead and add a module it's going to be Google Sheets and we are going to update a row this time now we are going to once again use this spreadsheet ID we can use it from this Google sheet right here from that data but then we'll just have to enter it manually okay so there we go and I'm just going to select the spreadsheet ID okay which essentially is my properties we get the sheet name but that's being fed in from the first Google sheet and then we're going to get the row number so I'm just going to whack that in like so now the column range I'm just going to select a to z and then we're going to actually find column F so this one right here so right there and we're going to use the return from open AI so this is the return object and we're going to find the return and it actually comes in the message content so that's what our return data that we want to use lives and I'm just is going to hit okay now if we run this once you will see the scenario is running and we're just waiting for it to essentially complete okay so amazing that scenario run was now complete and if we looking here the Des description was generated this is looking good are based on the property Nam stunning one bedroom and standpoint Tower with one bedroom one bathroom the view is a City View and the address is flat 109 stand Point Tower this is is the description that was generated okay I'm just going to maybe move that and I'm going to make this wrap over each other so we can read the whole thing the stunning one bedroom and standpoint Tower oozes luxury with its spacious layout a luring City View and modern Decor this property located at flat 109 boasts one bedroom and one bathroom it's nestled in the heart of downtown Dubai so this is where it gets good ious District known for its highend dining and shopping options so that's good I feel like open area really found out about downtown Dubai It also says the property is conveniently minuted away from landmarks like the buj Khalifa and do buy more so again it's used AI in order to probably look on a map and figure out what is close to our property and those are the landmarks it returned we also have glorious architectural sites of downt Dubai a less than 15 minutes walk from the metro station so we know it's close to a metro station making it easy to explore the fascinating cityscape I mean this is wonderful I'm so happy with this and of course every time we add a new line we'll just run it and another description will be generated for us thanks to our scenario okay so once that's finished running again you will see that has been generated pretty well if I might add now for those of you who cannot use chat gp4 this is important so click okay uh and if we run this this will not work right because okay so we can see nothing's been added here this is because the object that comes back is actually different so when we're trying to put something in F and we go to message content so choices message content there's nothing here this is because with the method we chose the returning text we need lives under choice text so that's what I'd have to pick out choices text and that will now be filled out into here so if I click okay and hit run TDA we've missed that one as that has already been you know officially ran but we get this text right here so this text is what is generating using the GPT 3.5 to Vinci model it's not as good in fact I don't even know why it's this short but you might have to Tamper around with the prompt okay but that is just some extra information for you if you don't have access to GPT 4 or if you're watching this in the future and there's a completely different model right that has a completely different return object okay great so hopefully that makes sense hopefully this also allows you to kind of debug things if you're getting stuck and have no idea what any of these values are um for now however I'm just going to change it back so let's just copy this again change this back to we create chat completion change the model of this to be GPT 4 again add an item roll user message content okay and then once again we just need to maybe let's run this so we know what comes back to us in the object and I'm just going to delete all that and this time we again need choices message content okay and wonderful and now if I just go ahead and maybe add a new line let's just go ahead and copy this one here cuz it didn't really return anything for us let's run this and amazing we get a beautiful description coming back to us once more and I'm just going to delete that one here maybe let's delete that whole row great so this is looking wonderful I'm super happy with this now you can schedule this you can schedule it at regular intervals to run every 15 minutes and check if there is a new line added you might want to do that that just means you can go ahead and work on the spreadsheet As You Wish leaving the description blank and it should initiate every 15 minutes and just update the latest row once so that is something you can do or you can do it once every day you can schedule it for days of the week and so on okay I'm just going to choose for it to be on Dem mon for now so that we run this whenever we want great so I hope this was kind of useful for you I'm just going to show you the full thing once more amazing let's move on if in this section I'm going to show you how to create an event ticketing system with Google Sheets Google Docs and barcodes that's right no need for some fancy CRM we're going to do all of this just with these simple tools and start selling tickets to events at scale with little to no teams behind us okay so let's do it okay so let's create a scenario so just going to go ahead and select here and I'm going to choose to call this scenario ticketing with barcode automation okay so we are going to be using a Google sheet with some information order to create barcodes for tickets and then the tickets themselves so let's go ahead and do this first off I'm just going to select the module that I want to start with as mentioned this is going to be a Google sheet so let's go ahead and search for Google Sheets and here we are now we need to watch for new rows so this is going to trigger when a new row is added so let's just go ahead and add that and let's create a connection if you don't have one yet so once again if you have been following along with this tutorial you should have a Google sheet connection already established but if you don't here's how you do it so we're going to create a connection I'm just going to sign in with my Google account and it should bring up this little popup right here in which I select my account I'm going to choose Anna code withth anna.com in order to access my Google account and allow make to see edit create and delete all of my Google Drive files okay and especially these spreadsheets because that is what I want to essentially be able to interact with so let's go ahead and allow that connection let's allow Mick to access those files and now well I think we're going to have to create a file so let's go ahead and do that so of course I'm already signed into my Google account as you can see here there is my Google account and its information and if I click on Google apps I can select Google Sheets in order to create a new sheet so let's go ahead and do that I'm going to just select blank spreadsheet right here and let's go ahead and name this something as these are tickets I'm just going to call this tickets okay so just like so and let's n name this sheet tickets as well you can of course call it whatever you would like now we're going to have to have some rows here so let's go ahead and name the columns for these rows let's start off with the ticket number being number one and just like in real life perhaps let's start with let's not start with one as it might get confusing I'm going to start off with ticket number 2201 okay so I'm just going to pen 220 to all these tickets 2202 2203 2204 2 05 okay and next we're actually going to have the row in which that ticket uh is assigned to let's go theow a b C and then let's just go a a and finally we're also going to have this seat number so again I'm just making these up right this is just for demo purposes and I've chosen rows to be letters just again so we can really see where that data is coming from all of these columns have a kind of different format to them great and of course you can you know stir this up a little bit if you would wish but you don't have to uh this is just for demo purposes I assume that if you have a spreadsheet where you track your ticket sales you'd have much more information such as the name of the ticket holder perhaps even the timestamp perhaps the price of the ticket there is so so much more you can add but of course for this tutorial this is the bare minimum we're going to need great so we have our spreadsheet made so let's go ahead and search by path let's look at my drive and now let's click here to choose the file so I'm just literally going to search for tickets we can search for it up here and there we go so we've selected the spreadsheet ID it is tickets and now we also need to select the sheet which I have named tickets so I can just get it from the drop down like so this does contain headers as we have added them here so we just want to make that really obvious so we ignore the headers row and great let's just go ahead and keep this as it is you can change the range if you want you know you can change it to just go up to the number c but I'm not going to do it I'm just going to keep it as it is and hit okay wonderful and I'm just going to select all and hit okay now that we've done that like I said we're going to use this information in order to create a ticket and a barcode so let's start off with making the barcode first I'm going to add another module here and let's just search for barcode simply like so and there we go and let's choose to generate a barcode now you can choose from many barcode types I'm going to choose to keep it as a QR code however you can have so many others okay so that is just something that you can do let's stick with QR code for now the text of this is going to be the ticket number okay because I want the QR code to be named after the ticket number so essentially after this so the first car code should be 20001 and we can actually also change the file name of this to be 20001 PNG so I'm just going to replace that like so and now the file name will be 21. PG or 22.png of the barcode itself and I'm just going to hit okay great so now we've created that barcode we actually need to do something with it and we're going to store it on on my Google Drive so once again maybe let's go back to Google so my Google account and go to my drive and I'm just going to create a folder in order to store this so I'm going to go ahead and create a new folder and let's just call this barcodes for now and click create so we have a folder called barcodes in here right now so now that's where we want to put these barcodes right so let's go ahead and add another another module I'm going to now search for Google Drive this time and select Google drive as that is where we want to store these files and we're just going to upload a file so let's select upload a file because once again we've created a barcode or a PNG of a barcode but we haven't really done much with it quite yet so let's go ahead and create a connection once more there's going to be a Google restricted connection and you might need to follow some external steps if you want to connect with a personal Google account to do that simply click on this guide okay I'm not going to be doing right now as these steps might vary in the future if you're watching this in the future so I'm just going to go ahead and select sign in with Google and once again I'm just going to select my account which is Anna at code withth anna.com and I'm going to allow this great so that is giving access to my Google Drive to the make app now the folder that we want we're going to actually select from a list and just make sure that my drive is selected and we're going to choose a folder I'm going to choose the folder that I literally just named called barcodes okay and the file I'm going to choose is barcode so just keep that selected and I'm just going to hit okay so if we run this now okay we will see this is running this is running and this is running and that is now completed the scenario run was completed if I look in here you will see a barcode right a barcode has been created two have been created so created this one and this one from my rows this is looking great so we have the barcodes next let's actually work on putting them in a ticket okay and in order to do this we're going to have to create a share link that will allow us to share this file to somewhere else so let's go ahead and do it I'm just going to move this over or perhaps maybe let's just minimize this slightly and move this like so and select here and add Google Drive again so this time we need to get get a share link so I'm just going to get a share link right here I've selected get a share link and this time again we're going to look in my drive we're going to look for a file and next we're going to find the file ID we can actually use it from the previous module right so if you look at all the modules here that was the first module we did and it's return the second module we did and it's return data and the third module is the one we literally just did with Google Drive when we upload loaded a file and that's its return so I'm going to choose file ID from here so let's just go ahead and get that file ID because we ran this once we do also get the returns of this data showing up here that is specific to its last run okay so that is kind of useful you might want to keep running this in order to get that information just so you kind of know what you're working with a lot better so let's go ahead and select the file ID this is a unique file ID that allow us to find files in Google Drive so that's all I'm going to do let's keep the roll as reader the type I'm going to just select anyone just to make it a little bit more generic and I'm just going to click okay so now if I run this we will get a share link to the file so in other words to this that was just created okay great one more step to go so the last step we need to do is actually create a ticket and for this I'm going to use Google Docs so once again let's go back in here back to my Google account and I'm just going to select docs like so and I'm going to create a blank document you guessed it and now I'm just going to create a ticket so I'm going to call this Dynamic barcode ticket and let's get creating so I'm going to choose to obviously just do this in a super super minimal way you can choose to do this however you wish I'm going to create a table for this let's give this six rows let's just type game one ticket let's also change the text to be a title perhaps I'm going to change the font please go ahead and just do whatever you wish I'm just kind of creating one that is super simple let's also add an emoji here and perhaps maybe let's Center all of this text so I'm just going to highlight it all and Center it so there we have I guess the header of our ticket next I'm just going to put some more information but first i'm going to split these cells out so in order to do that I'm going to format table split cell let's make it three columns and split and do the same for here so format table split cells let's make three columns and split here I think I'm just going to have Springfield bees okay so I'm essentially creating a fake Basketball ticket versus let's make another team Scranton bears and again let's have some emojis so I'm going to put a little B and let's put a little be let's also change this to be Pacifico let's make it a lot bigger same for this one let's go Pacifico perhaps let's put that on a new line again Pacifico make that 36 we can put in a date here so let's just go somewhere in the future like 04 04 2025 7 p.m. this is our fake game of course and let's make this again let's make this all Pacifico let's go with 24 this one perhaps has change to be size 14 Maybe maybe something a little bit more serious so I'm going to go with that one again make it bold however so here what I'm going to do in order to pick stuff out I'm going to use these two curly braces and I'm going to find the row okay in fact maybe let's make this a little bit more serious too with Roboto because we're going to be replacing that and once again same for here we're going to go with seat and we're going to pick this out in the document and replace it okay so this is looking quite good I'm just going to mess with this a little bit more let's make this a little bit bigger let's change this to size 24 I'm going to just put this on a new line maybe let's move it down a little bit I'm just going to change how this looks a little bit by adding some space thing just so it looks like as if it's centered okay so again we're going to be replacing the row with the row from here and replacing the seat with the seat from here let's move on uh let's have some generic texts in here like all exits are final no reentry is permitted and also camera FL flashes may not be used at any time during games okay so there we go and once again format a line to the left and here we're essentially going to be putting in the barcode so perhaps we don't even need this final row let's get rid of that I'm just going to delete the row great so this is where our barcode is essentially going to go let's just make that a little bit bigger and I think this will look good for now I'm just going to paste in one just so we can see what it will potentially look like in the future and perhaps I'm just going to also change the page borders in order to make this look nice so I'm just going to move that up a little bit just so that it all fits nicely on one page okay so just like that so that is kind of the template for our ticket let's carry on so in here what I'm going to do is add another module of course and now let's search for Google Documents so let's select Google Docs this time and this time I'm going to create a document but from a template so it already tells you that if you want to replace any text you need to use these tags so the tags in the two cly braces so this module also allow you to replace images by new images with URLs so that is something that we're going to do we're just going to have to select an account so I'm going to go ahead and select my Google connection and let's just go ahead and update this CU that is a requirement so once again just log in to to your Google account and allow make to access your Google account this time to see all your Google Docs documents too so let's update that so I'm just going to click allow and great and we're going to select by drop down my drive and now let's find the file that we just created so Dynamic barcode ticket okay and we're going to use that as a template we can now also change the title of the document itself so instead of having Dynamic barcode ticket I could change it so I'm just going to put ticket number and we're going to use the ticket number from collapse all these from the Google sheet we're just going to get the ticket number so just like so same as the row so once again I can go back to my Google sheet and get the row to replace the row and as the seat we can just get the seat okay great we can even replace it with so for example if we want some text row like this and then the seat just so it's really obvious what is going on because that whole thing will be replaced so the word seat will not exist anymore or you could have seat here it is really up to you however you'd like to do it great next we need the image URLs so so in the body image number one well this time I'm just going to get the share link right cuz we made a URL so we're going to get that share link now so let's get that share link like so if that does not work just make sure to change the share link here to the web content link instead wonderful and finally once that ticket is made let's put it somewhere so I'm going to actually go back in here go back to my drive and let's create a new one so I'm going to create a new folder and call this tickets okay and click create so there we go let's double click on here and let's see the tickets show up so now let's find it right we need to go into my drive and let's find that newly created folder called tickets and this is essentially where I want to save my newly created documents from the template so I'm just going to click okay wonderful so let's go ahead and run this and let's see what happens so of course we are now running this module which is worked we're creating a barcode we're uploading the file we're getting the share link and finally we're creating a document from the template that we just made so great the scenario was initialize let's see if that's been created and it has ticket number 2000 three so this one right here and if we click on it you will see these have been updated so we get row C we get seat 36 as well being updated so row C seat 36 that is looking good and this barcode should be unique let's have a look here and it is because it's completely different to this one this is looking wonderful I'm really happy with this if you would like like to increase the quality or the scale of the image all you could do is need to go to Advanced options and you can change these scales so for example I can make it scale time 10 and if I click okay and run this once more so once again we're just waiting for the modules to complete and now let's check in tickets to see the latest document that should be created and that's ticket 20 5 and if we double click on it you will see the barcode is of a much bigger scale okay it just looks a lot more crisp and a lot more professional great hopefully you'll find some great uses for this uh I love how many tickets you can create with this and in general it's just an awesome automation to have now while all the scenarios so far far have been dealing with customers and clients in some way this automation is more for dealing with your own colleagues or employees I'm going to show you how to make some inhouse automations so let's do it okay so let's go ahead and create a new scenario so let's go ahead and call this something I'm going to call this events from Trello cards now of course we're going to have to start off with our first module and we're going to start off at Trello so I already have a Trello account signed up to I'm just going to go ahead and search for Trello in here so here we have Trello and we are going to have to watch for cards so let's scroll all the way down here and we're just going to select watch cards okay so there we go now let's go ahead and create a connection so let's go ahead and start that up I'm going to go ahead and click save and it's just going to redirect me to give access to Trello so it's already noticed that I have signed up using Ana with codei anna.com so all I'm going to do is Click allow okay and it's going to give access to my whole Trello board so while that's doing its thing I'm just going to go ahead and go to Trello to show you what I have there okay so here is my trell account and I'm going to go ahead and create a new board I'm going to call this job I need to do and it's going to be a workspace so I'm going to go ahead and create that first off let's go ahead and create a few lists so maybe let's have a todo list containing cars that I am yet to do and then maybe let's have in progress and then let's have done so this is just again just an example of a typical trailer board and what I'm going to do is create cards that I'm going to essentially move from todo in progress until done so you might see this being used in a developer setting perhaps you work for a startup and you have loads of tasks or tickets that need completing so I'm going to pretend that we are a developer okay I am a developer or I'm working as part of a developer team and there's a card and this card says create button for new app and I'm just going to add that card so this is one card we have just created okay and we can do many things with this card we are going to have to for the purpose of the tutorial write a summary in here so let's go ahead and write a summary create a button for the new app that is aligned with The Branding documents okay so that is one thing you're going to have to do for this tutorial add a summary to the ticket and the other thing you're going to have to do is add a date or in other words a due date for this ticket so let's go ahead and select the 18th of January 2024 I'm just going to keep the time the same and we can have a due date reminder it is up to us and I'm just going to go ahead and save it so we've just added a date a due date to this ticket that is important and let's just go ahead and save it of course there are many many other functionalities to trell you can add members add labels add a checklist but this is not a trailer tutorial this is a make.com tutorial so I'm going to go ahead and shut that down for now okay so once again if you create a ticket just make sure that it has a summary or a description and a due date in order for our tutorial to work great so now let's go back in here we've created our Trello connections I'm just going to watch for all cards in Trello okay just to make our lives a little bit easier and I'm going to click okay now if you want it to be more specific you can watch out for cards on a specific board only in which we would have to pick out the board so the board I'm going to choose is jobs I need to do as that is is the one that we are working on here so that is an option like I said I'm just going to be more general for this tutorial and select all cut and click okay and let's just go ahead and start from now okay great the next thing we do is actually get that card so I'm going to select triler again and we're going to have to search for get a card so here we go and this essentially just returns a card back by its ID and we're going to get that from the first trailer module and we're going to search for data card and under card we're going to get the ID okay and that's all we're going to do and finally we have one more to do so once we create a card we're going to get the cards and we're just going to add an event on our Google Calendar so we're going to have to search for that here here we're going to get the Google connection under the calendar so Google Calendar and all we're going to do is create an event so first off we have to create that connection my Google connection is what I'm going to call it I'm going to sign in with Google once again you might already have this connection made if you have already made a Google connection before I'm going to make sure the account is Anya cod withth any.com as that is the calendar the Google Calendar I want to use in order to get events to pop up so let's go ahead and select that and this will allow make to see edit share and perly delete or calendars you can access using Google Calendar and I'm just going to click allow so I'm giving access to make.com for that and great my Google connection is now done now we're going to create an event uh we can do it quickly or in detail I'm going to select to do in detail and now we're going to have to select the calendar so this is the calendar associated with my Google Calendar here I of course signed into Google and under calendars you will see I have a few calendars here I have my here birthdays and tasks I'm just going to select to do this to Ana Kubo so let's go ahead and find that calendar ID Ana code withth anna.com and the event name well the event name we're going to get this from the actual card so the Trello card right here that comes back with get a card make sure get a card is the one you are going for not watch cards so you can minimize that if you want and expand get a card and we're going to get the description that we put in that card so let's scroll down here to get the description so once again this is the description that we will be using for the event okay great now down here we're just also going to use the due date so we're going to once again get the badges due date and the end date we're also going to get the badges due date so that's all you're going to have to do and click okay so that's really it I think we should give this a go so let's go back here I'm just going to create a new one let's go ahead and call this add header to app create the card once again we need to go in here and write down a description please create a header for the new app we are building that aligns with The Branding documentation let's also add a date a due date so let's go with January again the 19th at 640 and I'm just going to hit save okay great so that should be done this card has a due date it has a description so now if we run this TDA please create a header for the new app we are building that aligns with The Branding documentation wonderful and it's created at the right time the exact same time that the due date was added super simple I hope you've enjoyed this tutorial another thing you can do which is a fun one is potentially write an automation that will link messages that someone sends on a particular Discord channel to a Google sheet so for example in my own Discord Channel that I have for COD anna.com so this is where my community is and I have a channel specifically for people asking request to one of my GitHub repositories which is private it's a private repository that I have for people who are paying to take my course so I could potentially get an automation that will listen out for specific messages on a channel so here we can do it I'm going to go ahead and set this up now so if I create create a scenario here uh and then the first thing we're going to choose is of course Discord so please go ahead and select Discord as well and we're going to watch channel messages so this one right here that's the one that I'm going to choose and of course we need to create a connection so this is my Discord Channel okay I've just headed over to discord.com I already have signed up to this but you know the drill if you haven't signed up to use Discord before then please go ahead and sign up it is for free I'm just going to go ahead and open up my Discord so this is my Discord right here I actually am a member of many channels but the code with anna.com one is one that I own so I'm going to show you this with a completely new channel so that you can do the same but essentially what i' like to do is get anyone who wants GitHub access and message on here to be put in a spreadsheet for me so let's do it I'm just going to go down here and let's go ahead and create a new server so I'm going to go ahead and create my own this is going to be for a club or community and let's just call this demo server just like that and click create so here is my demo server of course at the moment there is no one here at all you can invite people to it you get this cool little link right here and then you can also edit the link so that it doesn't expire in 7 days you can make it either shorter or that it never expires so that is something that you can do great so this is my demo server right here and all I'm going to do is create a channel so I'm going to create a channel and let's call this access request and I'm going to create a channel so here we are there is is my channel and essentially if I want to you know say something like please write your email here if you would like access to my private giit Hub repository okay and then I can write that I can even pin it so for example pin message like so oh yeah pin it so that will always remain kind of at the top so great we have a channel and now let's create a spreadsheet so let's go ahead and do that I'm going to go here and I'm just going to create a spreadsheet like so so select spreadsheet and let's create a blank spreadsh sheeet so let's go ahead and call this GitHub requests and here I can have the email of the person who is making the request so which email I need to give access too and then I can have a column here just for me uh so permitted okay and we'll just put yes or no so once again this is super basic this is something that I think could be quite useful I can really be developed further as well so there we go I'm just making it a little bit prettier for you so great we have our Google Document we have our Discord Channel let's do it let's create a connection so you're going to have to give integram mat access to the Discord channel so I'm just going to go ahead and do that please do the same this popup should show up and you can select the server we know that we want it to be the demo server so make sure that that one is selected and just click continue and I'm just going to give access to all of this of course you don't have to if you don't want to that part is up to you but for this tutorial I'm going to do it and yes I am human so great that is now done its thing I'm now going to select the channel ID and it's access request that's the channel we want to watch and we can limit it to two per go uh that part again is going to be up to you this just means if you run this and there's more than two access requests in there it will stop at to so if you want you can make it 10 or you can just make it one each time that you run it again up to you I'm going to go ahead and do from now on and just click okay now let's go ahead and colnect this Google sheet so I'm going to go ahead and add another module and let's search for Google Sheets so just select that one and we are going to essentially add a row this time so go ahead and add a row make sure that this is connected if you don't have your connection set up and then we're just going to find the spreadsheet so the spreadsheet we know is called GitHub requests so I'm going to search for GitHub requests like this and then I'm just going to go down here and find the sheet name is is sheet one because sheet one is what we called it here we just give it the default naming and now we do have a table header so that is going to stay as it is and we can map out the values so I'm going to get up the object the whole object that comes back from Discord as you can see there is so so much here you get information about the author like its username you can even get the Avatar the timestamp of the message and so much more the channel ID there really is a lot to play around with for now though we're just going to get the content okay so that's all we're going to do and then I'm just going to essentially go back to Discord and let's just add an email address that I would like to give GitHub access to okay so the email of course you might like to you know specify like I did that you need to write email because essentially any message will get sent so that is just something that you're going to have to figure out so here is my message that I want to send over to here to be sent here and saved under this column so let's just send that and now I'm going to run this and we can look back in here and Ana code with anna.com was added and then I can whenever I get around to it say either this was given permission to or leave it blank for not yet so that is something that I can fill in manually this is just an organizational tool if I wanted to build this up more of course I can so let's go ahead and do that now I'm going to insert two more columns to the left I can also include the username of the user I'm just going to delete this for now let's turn this back to be yellow let's also choose to add a bottom border to this and maybe let's also add the Tim stamp of the request just so we know when this request came in so let's go ahead and try this again this just means I need to go back to here and we just need to adjust what we need to save to this spreadsheet so under email we are getting this however we do need to refresh this to get the latest Columns of the table so that's what that refresh button is for any changes will now be shown so there we go we've done it the username now shows up first then the Tim stamp then the email and then permitted so just like here username timestamp email and permited this is looking great but of course we don't want content from here and because we did run this once we're actually getting back all the data that is to our disposal so this is great so now let's go ahead and use the username which is author username so I can select that the timestamp there's an edited time stamp or we we don't want that we just want the timestamp and the email address well that's just going to be the content once more so let's select the content so that is now what I want to show up in my Google sheet we're just getting a little bit more data from Discord essentially so let's go ahead and click okay so we've now saved that let's go back here I'm just going to paste this once more so just pretend this is a fresh new email and hit enter and now let's run this once more as new data has come in and now if we look in here TDA we got the username is this my user Discord name well let's check it out yes it is that is looking cool uh we could have grabbed my avatar we could have grabbed all this information but we didn't we also got the time stamp so this is exactly the time stamp where we got this message at and then we also get the email address so the content of the message and then when I get round to it I can fill this out whether I've given GitHub access access to this user or not simply by going yes uh or just leaving it blank if I haven't yet so great I hope this tool was useful for you perhaps you can think of some good use cases for this for managing your clients for managing maybe leads as well perhaps you want to sell access to your GitHub repository uh I don't know that is up to you then again then you can add something uh more like a sales pudle so for example payment link sent paid and so on again this part is completely up to you this is more of a business question that you could probably answer yourself so great this is looking good now one thing you might have noticed is that the format of this Tim stamp isn't exactly great it's not very readable now you can go ahead and change it in here but why when you can change it on a make.com itself and send over your intended format from here so from the getgo so you can do this I'm just going to show you this now let's just work with the Tim stamp so let's get rid of these two things right here and if you go ahead and select the input you will see all these other tabs as well so these are showing up let's go into them so if I select on the general functions you will see some general functions that are available to you and if you hover over them it will also give you an explanation and an example of what this function is used for we also have some operators and keywords that are applicable to coding as well so booleans so you can essentially write code such as if this is true then that and so on we also have math functions so these are great for working with numbers where you can either round down numbers using math floor you can pass numbers you can get the max and Min of numbers you can get the sum of numbers and even round numbers as well so once again here we have an explanation and we also have some examples so for example if you pass through 1.2 through the round function you will get one and so on it is rounding the numbers we also have operators with numbers so you can add two numbers together divide the numbers and so on okay once again if you click on them or if you hover them you will get a description of what these do we also have functions and keywords for text so I'm going to show you this right now with the timestamp you might not really want to use this for the Tim stamp but I think let's just give it a go and you can apply this function when you need so for example the function length I've just hovered over it and seen that the function length takes a string of hello and tells us exactly how many characters are in it so let's try it out I just clicked on the function and now all I'm going to do is get this right here and whack it through like that so now let's hit okay and then let's go ahead and add another email again and send it and now let's let's run this so now if I go back here 32 is what comes back not the time St anymore the number 32 because 32 characters exist in the Tim stamp and we pass that Tim stamp through the function of length so that is my return value great so now let's carry on of course this is not useful for time stamps we want to format the time stamp so I'm just going to get rid of that wrapping function let's get back the timestamp so there it is and now let's go to the dates so the date and time is exactly what I would need here are my variables and we're going to format the date so if you hover over format date you can essentially see what the return will come back with this says a returns a date in the requested format and optionally in a specific time zone so for example we can set the format to be day day month month year year year and then the time so let's go ahead and try one of these out so if I want to set the date to be month day year we do kind of also want the time however so I think maybe let's go with this one right here so let's just go ahead and copy that we put the time step through first then we put this so let's move the time stamp here okay so in between this semicolon then we're going to do day day month month year year year let's also have the hour minute and then so just like so then we can also even add the time zone so Europe Prague if we wish so let's just go ahead and copy Europe Prague okay and let's just hit okay so now once more let's just copy this hit enter and run this like so and taada we get the day month year the time in a specific time zone which is you're Prague this is correct because I'm currently in Dubai and you're Prague is 3 hours behind me great I'm happy with this okay okay so hopefully you can have a look at some more of these as well we also have functions for working with arrays that is something that I didn't show previously where you have the functions to join you can get the length of items in the array you can slice the array so these are very you know JavaScript based functions and you can also write your own custom and system variables as well so a lot to play around with I hope you have fun in the section we will start off easy with automating responses to incoming emails we will set up a scenario that listens out to when we get an email into our Gmail account then we will use the openai API in order to categorize what kind of email it is is it request for help or is it a complaint for example once we know that we will use our Google sheet in order to decide what kind of response we want to give the email sender based on a template that we will write for the category we will then feed all this information back to open AI so that unique and personalized email can be drafted for us in Gmail looks good right okay so what are we waiting for let's do it okay so let's go ahead and create another scenario so I'm just going to click here and this scenario is going to be to automate responses to emails so let's go ahead and name this scenario I'm going to call this automate respond sis to emails using chat GPT and we're going to have to choose where you want to start off well of course we want to start off with watching out for emails that com in into our email address so I'm just going to go ahead and search for mail here so there it is and we're going to watch for emails so just select that one now we're going to have to create a connection so let's go ahead and click on here and the connection type we're going to use is Google restricted this is because I'm going to be linking up a Gmail account so I'm going to be selecting this one and show you the instructions in order to do it with a Gmail account however if you want to try another email please go ahead and choose from the ones below and if you get stuck please refer to the make.com documentations so let's go ahead and choose Google restricted I'm going to name this my Google restricted connection just like so and if you are having trouble with this there are some resources here in order to help you okay great now if you are using a personal Google account and not a work one like me you're going to have to follow this guide right here this might be updated at time of reading so just make sure to follow it through with the correct instructions okay great so I'm going to choose to save this this should open up this popup for me in which I'm going to choose my email address that I want the inbox to connect to and I'm just going to allow make to essentially read compose send and permanently delete all my emails from ANA Cod withth anna.com great now here on Def now here on the folders I'm going to choose to Target the inbox meaning that it is the inbox of my email account okay just the generic inbox and I can also choose a criteria for it to automatically respond to all unread emails okay so only if the email is unread do I want to create a email response for it we can do other stuff as in Target only emails sent from a specific email address we are not going to do that as well as subjects and so one okay so if you want to Target emails with a specific subject we can only respond to those or even emails containing a specific phrase we're going to leave the mark message as read as no as to not interfere with my inbox and I'm going to leave the maximum number of results as one as well wonderful so that is now done and let's just go with from now on so we're going to create a response from any email sent to Ana cod withth anna.com as of now okay wonderful now I'm going to add a connection so I'm going to add another module and this is going to be to open Ai and we're going to create a completion so we are using the open AI create completion in order for us to essentially categorize the kind of email that's coming in so we know how to deal with it so in order to do that we of course have to create a connection so I'm going to create a connection I'm going to call it my open AI connection if you have followed along to previous videos in this tutorial you will already have one here but I'm starting completely from scratch so we can do this together so I'm going to name my open AI connection my open AI connection and then this just means I need to head over to openai in order to get my API key and my organization ID in order to communicate with openai I do have a paid account so that is something you must keep in mind you must add some funds to your account for open AI in order to be able to use it the way I'm going to be using it today so let's head over to open AI right here all I'm going to do is log in so I've already signed up to open Ai and we want to communicate with it via the API once here I'm simply going to get my API key I'm going to create a new key let's call it test and create a secret key now please keep this safe as if someone takes this and uses it in their own project they can potentially rack up lots and lots on your credit card okay and use up for your token so just keep that safe so all I'm going to do is copy this don't worry I will be removing it so you can't use it in the future by simply deleting it like so and revoking the key so if you need to do the same just click on the revoke key button right here great so the API key I'm just going to paste in here and now we need to get the organization ID so in order to do that I can simply go to settings and I'm just going to copy this like so and then let's go back in here and just paste it and save so we've just created an open AI connection and now we're going to select a method the method we're going to choose is create a chat completion and the model please go ahead and use the latest model that you can I'm going to go ahead and select gp4 for this tutorial as that is the most uptodate one at the time of creating this tutorial for me now we're going to have to write a message and we're going to have to select a role I'm going to go with user and we're going to essentially ask open AI to categorize the email that's come in so in order to do this I'm going to literally write a prompt categorize the following the following email and then in quotation marks so just like so in here I'm going to get the text content of the email so we can get this from the essentially the response that comes back from email from the email module and I'm simply just going to choose to pick the text content so that's what I'm going to put in there which means that anything we write in the email will be input into here so as text in here so for example if we get an incoming email to Ana Codi anna.com that says what is my password in the body of the text this will essentially put that in the prompt and the prompt will read categorize the following email and then quotation marks it will say what is my password and then we're going to essentially ask it to categorize the following email containing what is my password into one of these categories okay and the categories are going to be inquiry or requests or complaints and issues now you can choose more categories if if you want the email to be more specific based on each one but for demo purposes I'm just going to choose these two and I'm just going to hit okay so there we go we've done it we'll get an email and then should be categorized into the two categories one being inquiry and requests and two being complaints and issues great now what do we want to do next well we want to provide an email template based on if it's one of the two categories so let's do it and this data will be held in a Google sheet so I'm going to go ahead and add another module so let's go ahead and find Google Sheets here from the dropdown and we're just going to search rows so let's go ahead and select search rows and before we do that we're going to create a connection but not before actually create creating the Google sheet first so in order to do this I can essentially just get up my Google Sheets so if we go here I am of course logged into Google so I can just simply click on here and select on sheets and then let's name this sheet something so I've just created a blank Google sheet which I'm going to name responses and in here we're going to create a column called category and then we're also going to create a column called prompt and we're essentially going to provide a prompt based on what kind of category the email belongs to so like I said the first one is inquiry or requests and the second one is going to be complaints and issues okay so those are the two categories that we discussed of course you can make this look as nice as You Wish by kind of styling this up slightly so just like so and once again this is the first category and this is the second category and the first prompt that we want to write for if an email is an inquiry request is going to be the following so I'm just going to paste this in like so because we can essentially go through it together so in quotation marks I've essentially written a prompt to give open AI if the email receive is an inquiry or request and the prompt reads provide an email reply to this inquiry request with all the relevant information that has been requested use this email sample as context when drafting your reply so we are essentially teaching openai how we want our response to look uh it's going to have a subject re request for technical support and if the customer's name is you know detectable we'll put d customer's name and again this is just a suggestion to open AI so the suggestion we have given is thank you for contacting our technical support team about the issue you're experiencing with product or service name we understand how important it is for you to have a seamless experience and we're here to assist you in resolving this issue promptly based on your description appears that the problem may have been caused by and then we insert the possible cause and then we also say in order to troubleshoot and resolve this issue please follow these steps and we want three steps to be given once you've completed these steps please restart your device and check if the issue has been resolved if you're still experiencing difficulties please do not hesitate to contact us again you can reach us through email live chat or by the phone and then we give a phone number or our technical support team is available day and hours of operation to provide you with the utmost assistance we appreciate your patience as we work together to resolve this issue and thank you for choosing our company best regards technical support specialist this is the emo okay so I'm going to show you how this works this is great for example if someone Emil in saying they are having trouble with their password or something more advanced but we will see that in action next let's also provide a prompt for if there's a complaint or issue so once again I'm just going to paste this in like so okay so that is the whole thing you will see in a Cell by itself so that is one cell and this is another cell so in quotation marks I'm just going to put provide an email reply to this complaint issue with all the relevant information that has been requested use this email sample as context when drafting your apply and again we're going to have a subject complaint or issue dear customer if a customer name exists thank you for contacting our complaints team about the issue you're experiencing with and then the product or service name we are sorry your experience hasn't been smooth so far is there anything we can do to help with the issue best regards technical support Specialists or we can even put complaints specialist to train it a bit more specifically for if the email is a complaint or issue great so this is looking good let's go ahead and name this as responses I don't know why that didn't save and let's also name the sheet so I'm going to rename this to template okay so just like that and now back in here let's go ahead and create a connection so I'm going to select this and let's name this my Google connection this is the first time or to be more specific I'm acting as if this is the first time I'm creating a Google connection and I'm just going to have to sign in with Google so once again we get a little popup I'm going to select my Gmail account which is Ana Codi anna.com and this will allow make to C edit or create delete all my Google Drive files as well as C edit create and delete all my Google sheet spreadsheets so I'm happy with that so I'm just going to click allow wonderful okay great and now once that connection has been established I can essentially select from my drive and then I find the spreadsheet spreadsheet I named responses and then I'm going to find the sheet name which is templates correct because that is what we call the sheet down here this table does contain headers so that is correct and this time we're going to filter so I'm going to choose category cuz we're going to filter the category and we're going to get the text operates equal to let's make it case insensitive and then we're going to go with choices message content and let's also keep the order ascending and that is looking good okay so once again this is just the response that's going to come back from open AI so once open AI has created a response and that is in deciding if the email belongs to inquiry requests or complaint issues once again let's just make sure that we know what we're talking about so here we essentially want it to match inquiry requests or complaints issues right so one of these then we know which email template we're going to use so let's go ahead and press okay on that and wonderful so this is looking good now that we know if our email that's coming in is either going to use this template or this template we need to send it back to open AI in order to make up a unique response based on the template so I'm going to once again use open AI as my module and we're going to create a completion let's go ahead and select GPT 4 add a message the role of this is going to be the user and the message content well it's simply going to be the prompt so the prompt which is the this column and we're also going to send over the text content from the email so text content wonderful and let's click okay so this is being built out we've already got four modules here we have one more to go and that is to create a draft in our email address so I'm going to go ahead and select this select email and we're going to create a draft email em address it's the same email address so Ana Codi anna.com so it's the same Google connection is the Google restricted connection however this time I'm going to put this in drafts so let's go ahead and check the folders that I have existing in that email address let's go with drafts and let's add an email recipient I'm just going to make a fake one so John example.com as we don't really want to send this anywhere we just want to make a draft the subject well this is going to be the subject from the email that came in so let's go ahead and select subject you will see this is pulsating so we know which module this is coming from great the content type I'm just going to keep us HTML and the content is going to say hi and then we're going to get the choices message content okay so that is from the latest open AI resp response that we got wonderful so let's click okay and let's run it so I'm just going to head over to my actual email there is currently no drafts in here that is good cuz our automation hasn't created any and I'm just going to compose an email to this email address I'm going to go to Ana Codi anna.com so that draft has now been added the subject is going to be my password is not working and then I'm just going to pretend to be someone else hello I have tried putting in my password numerous times and it has not worked what should I do please advise okay and let's just say this is from Danny Doyle okay so Danny Doyle just imagine Danny Doyle is sending an email to Anna Codi an.com the subject is my password is not working and this is the body of the email and I'm just going to send it so at the moment that is sent this is being sent to Anna at code with Anna so let's go ahead and run this so I'm going to go ahead and run this like so the scenario is now initialized and you will see it progressing slowly and slowly until it hits this section right here okay and finally that email was created so the scenario one was complete and this just means that everything went through smoothly let's have a look in here and Tada a draft was created in my email address let's have a look at what chat gbt came up with so like I said John example.com was used as the email address the subject is simply the subject that I wrote in the email to Ana coda.com as we also set and here's what chat gbd came back with so here we go here is the subject the subject regarding password issue Dear Mr Doyle thank you for reaching out to our support team with your concern and I'm sorry to hear about the issue are facing with your password in order to assist you better could you please try the following steps to resolve this one ensure your caps lock is is not turned on two verify if you are entering the correct username associated with the account and three clear your browser cache and then try again four is try resetting your password if you need instructions how to do this please let us know if these steps don't solve the issue please rever back so we can take more drastic measures such as resetting your passord from our end we are committed to ensuring that your experience with our services seamless and hasslefree we appreciate your patience and understanding this matter and are always here to assist you best regards and then you know if I'm Happ with this perhaps we don't need the high here I would of course maybe format this a little bit more and put my name in here Ana Kubo complaint specialist and if I'm happy with that I mean that really saved me so so much time in regards to writing an email okay so thank you chat GPT this is looking good and I'd go ahead and send it if I'm happy with it so there we go of course you might even want to format this a little bit better but this is essentially super super ready to go I mean I don't think I would have been able to write this better myself right pretty cool if you ask me okay so shall we perhaps try another one so I'm just going to uh minimize that and perhaps let's try write a complaint so before we do that I'm just going to get rid of this high right here and click okay so please feel free to you know perfect this tweak it as you wish perhaps for the subject you might want something else you can choose from literally all the returns of the modules that are to your disposal once you have run this once you will even see The Return of what's coming back okay okay so you can use that too this might be quite good to run if you are a bit stuck just so you can see what you have to work with okay great so like I said let's try another one let's try and make a complaint to Anna at code with Anna let's pretend to be Becky Boo the subject is I don't like your platform I am sorry but I am not a fan of your platform I think the colors are too bright can you tell your UI team this as well as your brand in team thanks it's an odd complaint but you know I can't really think of anything else to complain about so let's go ahead and try it so once again I am sending an email to Ana cwith anna.com I'm pretending to be Becky Buu the subject is I don't like your platform and this is essentially the body of the email so let's go ahead and send that so that is now sent and now if I run this scenario once more so let's go ahead and run it and you'll see these steps working so there we go they are slowly working you will even see a little timer going off until all of it is complete you will see the scenario run was successful so great so now if we go back here hopefully this has recognized that this is a complaint so the complaint category should be triggered in order to use this as a 10 template and amazing I don't like your platform of course there's a spelling mistake there I don't like your platform and then what has chat GPT suggested as a response subject read feedback on platform design Dear Miss Becky thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback on the visual design of our platform we appreciate your honesty and take your opinion seriously we understand that the color scheme of our platform may not be to everyone's liking our UI and branding team strives design a platform that balances aesthetic appeal and usability in the best way possible that being said we assure you that your feedback will be shared with both our UI and branding teams we are constantly making improvements based on the feedback we receive from our users like you your comfort and satisfaction of utmost importance to us after all without losers like you we wouldn't be here once again thank you for bringing this man to our attention if there's anything else you wish to share or any other way we could assist you please do not hesitate to let us know best regards and once again I will just put Ana Kubo this time I'm a complaints specialist okay and then I would just hit send so once again how much time saved is that that's pretty amazing if you're feeling more bold you might even want to put the email address of the user in here but you know I'd probably refrain from doing that inless you press send by mistake and you haven't checked what chat GPT has essentially written for you okay so great once again if you do want that email address in here instead you would simply scroll down and find who this came from this did come from Anna at code withth anna.com as the sender so you would just replace that like so and hit okay okay wonderful so I hope you've enjoyed this tutorial I think this is a great one to use if you tweak it your liking it could be so so incredible for your business okay so I hope you found this course useful once again here is a recap of everything that we have covered in this extensive automation course I hope to see you again in the future on the free cckm Channel
