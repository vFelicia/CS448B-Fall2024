00:02 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:04 - with jesse i'm jesse
00:06 - and today
00:08 - i have a new webcam
00:10 - and i also have sunglasses on so you
00:13 - might be able to see in the reflection
00:15 - the webcam is really bright
00:17 - so bright
00:20 - that i was thinking about wearing
00:21 - sunglasses
00:23 - because it's super bright but
00:25 - the lights are nice they i have the
00:28 - lights off in my office but
00:31 - my face is
00:32 - lit up before the only lighting that i
00:35 - had was a small lamp that didn't really
00:37 - do anything and then on my other screens
00:40 - that you can't see when i'm streaming
00:43 - i
00:44 - tried to make them um be white so i'd
00:47 - use like the white theme on youtube and
00:52 - try to put
00:54 - basically just windows
00:56 - like
00:56 - chrome windows with all white
00:58 - backgrounds
01:00 - uh all around
01:01 - my main screen so this should be a much
01:04 - better solution
01:06 - than uh just trying to use my monitors
01:09 - although i'll probably end up taking the
01:11 - sunglasses off because they they do help
01:14 - with the brightness but
01:16 - i can't really read my code that well
01:18 - it's too dark
01:22 - but i haven't streamed for a while i had
01:24 - pretty crazy end of the week last week
01:27 - had some
01:29 - kind of like emergency things that
01:31 - needed to um
01:33 - needed to be fixed so i had to
01:36 - basically my boss
01:38 - and his boss
01:39 - had to do a presentation to a bunch of
01:42 - members of the board here on saturday
01:45 - and so i had to type something up for
01:47 - them and make sure that there was a
01:49 - fully functional demo site
01:51 - uh so
01:53 - i got all that working
01:54 - and i also added a proper url and
01:59 - ssl certificate to our wordpress
02:01 - installation
02:02 - so if you have the code
02:05 - locally on your machine definitely do uh
02:09 - do a get pull get the latest well if you
02:12 - have a fork then
02:14 - do what you need to do to get the um
02:16 - to update your fork
02:18 - and
02:19 - then um make sure it has the new url
02:24 - because it may not work to grab data
02:26 - from the old ip address
02:29 - and the reason i needed to do that is
02:31 - because i was running the demo site with
02:33 - an ssl certificate when it tried to grab
02:35 - the data from the ip address which of
02:37 - course was just http
02:40 - it couldn't get that data
02:43 - without
02:44 - an error popping up that hey you're
02:46 - trying to load you know http data on
02:49 - https
02:51 - so
02:52 - it took way longer to get that all set
02:54 - up than i thought
02:55 - but it's all running now
02:58 - and today we are going to create a
03:02 - scroll spy component i had a nice
03:05 - meeting earlier today with one of the
03:06 - students uh who is
03:09 - working on one section of this site
03:12 - and it would benefit them if they had a
03:14 - scroll sky scroll spy component so we're
03:16 - going to make the basic functionality
03:18 - for them and they can adjust it as
03:20 - needed
03:22 - also
03:23 - they were just
03:24 - offered a job which is really awesome so
03:29 - he's going to graduate in may and
03:31 - already has a job lined up
03:34 - so that was pretty cool and helping out
03:36 - on this project helped him
03:39 - to
03:40 - to get the job because although the job
03:42 - doesn't deal directly with front-end
03:44 - development
03:45 - they were really interested
03:47 - in the fact that he knew about
03:49 - javascript because that's something that
03:52 - they they need i guess they needed more
03:54 - people that knew about that so
03:56 - it may be something they add on to his
03:58 - job after he starts so i thought that
04:00 - was kind of cool that somewhat like
04:02 - indirectly
04:04 - uh
04:05 - you know that this project kind of
04:06 - helped him out in getting a job so that
04:08 - was really cool
04:10 - um
04:11 - let me think uh it looks like we have a
04:14 - decent amount of people i'm gonna take
04:16 - off the shades for now
04:18 - um
04:19 - so i'm gonna try to get started
04:21 - uh i don't think there's anything else
04:23 - to update you all on in terms of you
04:26 - know things that have happened in the
04:28 - site uh there's one weird thing going on
04:30 - with my tests
04:32 - my unit tests were failing so i messed
04:35 - around a little bit with it and now for
04:37 - some reason the um the index test
04:41 - uh the snapshot is huge like we're
04:44 - talking like over 50 megabytes huge
04:48 - so i messed something up so i may just
04:50 - end up removing the
04:52 - the test for the index page for now
04:55 - because it's taking forever to load uh
04:58 - and then just trying to figure out what
05:00 - was wrong with it
05:01 - you know sometime later
05:04 - so if you're having trouble with the
05:05 - test
05:06 - it's something i did i don't i don't
05:09 - know
05:11 - and uh let's see
05:13 - yeah so let's get into it
05:17 - i should probably start up ngrok before
05:19 - we start
05:35 - so some of you may remember that i was
05:37 - having some issues with the built-in
05:38 - camera
05:40 - so hopefully
05:42 - i will not have the same issues with
05:44 - this other webcam
05:45 - for some of you are asking why i have
05:47 - the sunglasses on it's because my new
05:49 - webcam has a really bright like ring
05:51 - light around it so i can't remember who
05:54 - it was but somebody recommended to me to
05:56 - get the uh
05:57 - the razer uh keo
06:00 - uh webcam and i did get that and so far
06:03 - i really like it the quality is
06:05 - definitely better than the one that's
06:06 - built into an imac or a macbook pro and
06:09 - the fact that it has the built-in light
06:11 - is really nice for me because i'm always
06:12 - coding in the dark
06:14 - so i didn't really want to invest in in
06:16 - extra lighting
06:18 - and i'm not really sure how the best way
06:20 - to set that up anyway so this is simple
06:22 - i mean obviously it's not like
06:24 - you're the best you can get but you know
06:26 - really it's not
06:28 - it doesn't really make sense for me to
06:30 - invest in all this equipment you know
06:32 - i'm just kind of doing this on the side
06:33 - i don't get any money for this so
06:35 - uh
06:36 - wouldn't necessarily be the the smartest
06:38 - investment
06:41 - all right uh world says the only thing
06:43 - is that the audio is out of sync
06:47 - okay
06:48 - i'm gonna have to look into how to fix
06:51 - that then
06:52 - let me um
07:05 - all right so i just did a google search
07:07 - on that and that way when the stream's
07:09 - over
07:12 - i will remember that and i'll check out
07:14 - that uh the search results
07:17 - yeah so i don't really want i don't want
07:19 - that to happen all the time i'm gonna
07:20 - try to fix that because i know it can be
07:22 - annoying when it's out of sync whenever
07:24 - i put the code up on the screen it you
07:26 - know you probably won't be looking at my
07:28 - face anymore so it won't be as big of a
07:30 - deal
07:31 - let's see
07:33 - so i'm switching now
07:38 - and
07:39 - let's go over let's start this pomodoro
07:41 - timer
07:44 - and so i'm going to do one pomodoro
07:46 - session and then we're going to take a
07:47 - break and we'll do some uh
07:50 - answer some questions in the live chat
07:52 - and then i'll go back and do another
07:53 - pomodoro session we'll see how much we
07:55 - can get done
07:56 - uh probably two pomodoro sessions is
07:59 - you know all i'm gonna do today you know
08:01 - at that point we'll probably be getting
08:03 - close to
08:04 - uh 6 p.m my time and then that's that's
08:07 - definitely time for me to get home and
08:09 - and help get the kids ready for bed
08:13 - all right so
08:16 - uh first thing i'm going to do
08:20 - let's see
08:21 - yeah let me just get rid of this index
08:27 - unit test for now
08:32 - let's delete that
08:34 - and then i'll get rid of the snapshot
08:40 - since i don't really have time to figure
08:41 - out why that's that's not working
08:43 - properly
08:44 - so
08:46 - and i don't want it to take
08:49 - to mess up our
08:51 - um our process
08:54 - of testing and just take forever so
08:56 - we're just going to get rid of that for
08:57 - now
08:58 - and uh we need to grab
09:02 - let me go over here on my other screen
09:06 - so that we can get some code
09:13 - because i know we've done something like
09:15 - this before
09:24 - let's check out
09:28 - i'm gonna pull this over on the other
09:30 - screen as soon as i get it get it
09:32 - working
09:40 - all right let's pull this over so i just
09:43 - want you all to have a visual of what
09:45 - this is going to look like it's going to
09:47 - be really simple
09:49 - just a little menu on the side which
09:52 - let me zoom out
09:54 - that is going to
09:56 - you know have a position fixed and as we
09:58 - scroll down the page
10:00 - it highlights the area that you are in
10:02 - the page and if we wanted to just skip
10:04 - to an area
10:07 - just press the button and it skips to
10:09 - the area
10:10 - okay so
10:12 - that's what to do this one's a little
10:14 - bit
10:16 - buggy actually like it's not exactly
10:20 - there we are
10:21 - we may have to improve upon that because
10:23 - this is not working
10:27 - exactly right
10:32 - so
10:34 - but this is basically how it's going to
10:35 - look
10:39 - and i need to
10:42 - find the github repo for this as well so
10:45 - let me pull this over
10:48 - and
10:50 - where are we at
10:52 - resource center
10:55 - yeah that was it
11:00 - let's go into our source
11:02 - and
11:03 - our views
11:05 - and
11:07 - planning guide
11:10 - and we'll figure out what we call this
11:18 - uh i i don't think we put this in a
11:20 - separate component so
11:23 - did we
11:31 - active section
11:40 - hmm
11:46 - okay yeah it looks like we're tracking
11:48 - scroll position
11:50 - and everything in here
11:59 - okay but then we we do have this
12:01 - planning guidelines component
12:06 - all right so that makes sense
12:10 - so i guess the first thing we'll do is
12:13 - add what we need to to the actual page
12:18 - and then we'll check out what's here in
12:20 - our our planning guidelines component
12:24 - that we'll need to bring in and use to
12:26 - create our own component
12:29 - so i'm going to move this off to my
12:30 - other screen so i can can look at it
12:35 - and then
12:36 - we're going gonna go in here to
12:41 - oh yeah it's the
12:44 - missions.js page so
12:47 - the the student who's who's been working
12:49 - with me
12:51 - um
12:52 - so basically they're doing like uh an
12:55 - internship
12:56 - uh with with me
12:58 - and then they're also
13:01 - working with another department on a
13:03 - project and so we we have uh at um this
13:07 - university a whole department uh
13:09 - dedicated to missionary work so like
13:13 - uh they go into places all over the
13:16 - world like you know really really poor
13:18 - areas
13:20 - and
13:21 - help with like to teach you know kids
13:24 - and at orphanages and you know feed the
13:26 - poor do a kind of stuff like that on
13:28 - spring break
13:30 - which is really kind of cool you know a
13:31 - lot of people on spring break they go
13:33 - party well our students go and um
13:36 - uh you know they they help the poor
13:39 - so it's definitely it's good but right
13:41 - now on the website
13:43 - the section for that isn't spectacular
13:46 - so
13:47 - the uh the head of that department is
13:49 - really nice guy
13:50 - he's always wanted something nicer for
13:52 - that and we really didn't have you know
13:54 - the capability or the resources to do
13:56 - that on the the old website
13:58 - uh but on this website i think it's
14:00 - gonna look a lot nicer and so
14:05 - um
14:06 - a group of students
14:08 - has been working on
14:11 - on doing that and uh they've been i've
14:13 - been kind of collaborating and just you
14:16 - know checking in
14:18 - and uh
14:19 - basically giving them like
14:21 - the whole framework and like here's what
14:23 - what you need to work within
14:26 - and i started them out on building the
14:28 - page with just basic html and css
14:30 - because that's what they're comfortable
14:31 - with and i said once you build it out
14:33 - and you like how it looks
14:34 - then we can convert it into react so
14:37 - that's where we're at right now is
14:38 - converting that page into react so we
14:40 - did some work on it this morning
14:42 - and i i think it's it's looking kind of
14:45 - nice so we should be able to see
14:48 - um
14:50 - yeah let me go to that page so we can
14:52 - see
14:53 - what's happening
14:54 - so we're at localhost
14:57 - 3000
14:58 - and
14:59 - you all should see this page too
15:03 - missionary outreach so if you have that
15:06 - ngrok link that i uh pasted in there a
15:08 - little while ago
15:10 - and um you type at the end of it slash
15:14 - missionary hyphen outreach then you'll
15:16 - see this page
15:18 - and so i think
15:20 - it's really you know not bad like this
15:22 - student that has done this work is a
15:24 - computer science student and doesn't
15:25 - really have a whole lot of experience
15:27 - with javascript and front-end
15:29 - development at all so
15:31 - uh and just
15:32 - you know just this semester has gone
15:34 - from basically having zero experience
15:36 - with react at all
15:38 - you know to being able to build this out
15:41 - and um
15:43 - i think it's
15:45 - it's certain it's looking pretty good
15:47 - i'm not sure about this header right
15:49 - here let me know what you all think
15:51 - about this so i i told him to leave it
15:53 - in
15:54 - because i'm just not sure about it i
15:56 - know it's it's like
15:58 - i didn't want to say no automatically
16:00 - because it's a new design element so i
16:02 - want to get over that like shock of like
16:04 - hey i've never seen that design element
16:06 - in this site this particular site before
16:09 - and just kind of
16:10 - uh give it a few days and look at it but
16:12 - i would like your opinion
16:15 - on what do you think for sections having
16:18 - you know this kind of thing instead of
16:21 - like a full you know across the page
16:24 - strip
16:25 - just kind of a half
16:28 - you know
16:29 - i don't know i'm not sure about it but i
16:30 - would definitely uh like some some input
16:34 - on that but the idea is is that each one
16:37 - of these
16:38 - um these cards
16:40 - and uh he had a nice adaptation of the
16:43 - cards that we were using on the home
16:44 - page
16:45 - um each one of these you'd be able to
16:48 - click learn more and it would have its
16:49 - own page that would have videos from
16:52 - that particular trip
16:54 - pictures
16:55 - and then kind of maybe like a story of
16:57 - what happened on that trip and more
16:59 - information
17:02 - um
17:07 - yeah and then we'll have it on the other
17:08 - end on the wordpress side of things
17:10 - we're going to make it really easy for
17:11 - the people that work in that department
17:13 - to edit that so all the fields will be
17:15 - marked out so that if as soon as they
17:17 - add a new post it'll automatically
17:20 - appear in the right section on this home
17:22 - page and it will create
17:24 - its own its own page
17:27 - so
17:30 - that's what we have so far
17:32 - i mean i can already see a few things
17:34 - that maybe i would adjust just little
17:36 - things font size you know here and there
17:38 - um let me check i see a few you are
17:42 - bringing in
17:44 - or you're uh adding some some opinions
17:47 - here so i'm going to check it real quick
17:48 - while we're
17:50 - while we're on this page
18:06 - okay some
18:08 - some advice here on this uh this side
18:10 - thing
18:12 - frankie's saying um you know maybe it
18:14 - should be centered
18:16 - um
18:17 - swap swapnil says need more margin and
18:21 - maybe make it bigger so it's more
18:23 - prominent
18:24 - um
18:25 - okay so frank you saying make the the
18:27 - tech center
18:28 - oh okay
18:31 - you can make more margin bigger yeah i
18:33 - could see it being bigger would be good
18:36 - all right thank you i appreciate that um
18:39 - that feedback there
18:42 - so it'll probably get adjusted a bit
18:45 - you know at least it'll get adjusted a
18:48 - bit my thought was you know i'd just
18:50 - have text right there as another header
18:52 - and it wouldn't it wouldn't have any
18:53 - background or anything
18:56 - but i i do want to give this this a
18:58 - chance
19:01 - all right so what we want to do then on
19:03 - this page is make that that side
19:07 - uh navigation and it's going to be a
19:09 - little tricky right because it's not as
19:11 - simple as what we did on that last page
19:13 - that i showed you
19:14 - uh we can't just put it right here it's
19:16 - going to look terrible right so we need
19:20 - you know basically as we scroll down
19:27 - you know at
19:28 - maybe it starts to appear here
19:31 - so let's say it it scrolls with the page
19:34 - until you get here and then we go to
19:36 - position fixed and then it'll scroll
19:38 - down with you and if you scroll back up
19:41 - it would stop here and not go up any
19:43 - higher
19:45 - i think
19:46 - i think that's what we need
19:49 - um
19:50 - you know we definitely need
19:52 - you we definitely don't want it to to be
19:54 - up here
19:56 - so it's gonna have a little bit of
19:58 - different functionality but first things
20:00 - first let's just get some of the code
20:01 - over
20:02 - and
20:03 - then we can adjust it uh as as we need
20:06 - to so
20:08 - let's go in
20:10 - oops i've already moved it over here so
20:12 - look we're in this missions.js
20:16 - page
20:18 - and let's scroll down
20:25 - here we are so i did um let's see get
20:29 - initial problems
20:31 - yeah so i had some things in here that i
20:33 - had commented out for uh for the student
20:35 - that i'm working with just to say like
20:38 - here's here it is if you need it right
20:41 - uh at some point we'll probably we'll be
20:43 - pulling in data so that's why i kind of
20:45 - want to leave this in here even though
20:47 - we're not pulling in data yet
20:51 - so let's bring in
20:54 - what we have
20:58 - from this other component
21:10 - okay so we have quite a bit
21:12 - and i'll bring it in but then we'll uh
21:14 - we'll definitely need to go over it a
21:16 - bit
21:28 - okay so this is what we have
21:33 - and
21:34 - we definitely would need to bring in
21:36 - throttle
21:38 - from low dash
21:41 - which we are
21:42 - we are using elsewhere so
21:45 - we won't need to
21:47 - [Music]
21:48 - um
21:49 - uh to bring in this uh
21:52 - npm package
21:53 - and then right now we're not using this
21:56 - log page view
21:58 - so let's get rid of this
22:05 - and
22:06 - what's up with this why
22:10 - each is not defined
22:22 - i'm like
22:23 - thinking didn't didn't we do something
22:26 - similar to this already
22:39 - i guess we didn't
22:41 - i just uh
22:44 - have this feeling like we've done this
22:46 - before maybe i'm just thinking of the
22:48 - other project
22:56 - okay
23:21 - all right so there's definitely some
23:22 - things that
23:25 - we will need to change
23:33 - or at least
23:34 - adjust
23:40 - all right since we have this here
23:43 - are we not
23:45 - yeah okay so we we don't
23:48 - most of our markup is actually going to
23:50 - live in this component and not being
23:52 - another component
23:54 - uh so you can check out
23:56 - let me give you the link to this github
23:58 - page that i have on my other screen so
24:00 - you all can see that as well
24:02 - um
24:07 - if you click the link that i just pasted
24:09 - in and it doesn't work try copying and
24:10 - pasting it uh that'll usually work
24:22 - so i need to go
24:24 - to a different component uh in this
24:26 - other repo
24:29 - to planning guidelines and see
24:34 - what we're doing here
24:35 - there's prosthetics
24:58 - hmm
25:27 - scroll to item
25:34 - all right so in our
25:38 - component did mount for the the other
25:41 - component in that other repo that we're
25:43 - we're checking out the resource center
25:45 - repo
25:46 - um for the planning guidelines.js
25:49 - component we do have something extreme
25:51 - component did mount
25:53 - and um we're bringing in
25:57 - four slice headers from get top
25:58 - coordinates
26:01 - so we're actually bringing quite a bit
26:04 - more than i even
26:08 - realized i'm planning on dating
26:16 - wow
26:20 - this is way more complicated than i
26:22 - imagined
26:33 - i definitely didn't remember it being
26:35 - this complicated
26:36 - probably it's because
26:38 - uh one of you
26:40 - did most of the work for this component
26:42 - and not me
26:43 - that's usually uh what what it happens
26:46 - whenever i go back and i'm like well i
26:48 - don't remember doing that
26:50 - okay so let's
26:53 - add this in once i get everything on
26:55 - this page we'll go through it more
26:57 - closely and see like what does it do and
26:59 - what do we need to change
27:02 - but for now
27:06 - ref title id id okay
27:21 - um
27:34 - trying to find where that
27:37 - spring mission trips okay
27:39 - um
27:50 - um
27:56 - what are you gonna do is spring
28:05 - oops
28:07 - spring
28:11 - what am i thinking
28:12 - okay there we go so
28:15 - spring
28:17 - and
28:20 - let's give it an id
28:23 - of
28:25 - spring as well what am i
28:30 - use of string literals and ref
28:31 - attributes is
28:34 - deprecated
28:37 - okay
28:41 - um
28:45 - all right so we have it there
28:46 - let's just give it
28:49 - let's throw in another one here
28:51 - uh at the bottom
28:54 - i guess we don't need it all the way at
28:55 - the bottom do we
29:04 - let's put it
29:06 - down here
29:13 - put another one down here and let's just
29:16 - call this summer
29:21 - just so we have another one
29:23 - for our menu
29:27 - so for right now i'm okay with hard
29:29 - coding this uh because
29:32 - there's only going to be four sections
29:36 - uh and there's not like we're not going
29:38 - to add more seasons to the year right
29:40 - it's going to be
29:42 - spring summer fall and winter
29:46 - otherwise i would
29:48 - you'll probably be looping over things
29:50 - and adding more
29:53 - we will do that eventually but for now
29:55 - we you know that we don't need to mess
29:57 - with that it's just going to add some
29:58 - complexity that
30:00 - we don't really need right now
30:03 - okay so
30:04 - since we're doing that we will be able
30:06 - to get rid of a bit of this up here
30:09 - but let's let me make sure i have
30:11 - everything over here first
30:14 - also if you're asking questions and
30:15 - you're wondering why i'm not answering
30:17 - them i will answer questions in just
30:19 - about two minutes
30:21 - i like to break things up and do some
30:22 - code and then go and do some questions
30:25 - you know kind of back and forth
30:30 - all right so i think i have almost
30:31 - everything
30:34 - we just need
30:40 - this planning guide nav component
30:59 - okay so i'm going to bring in
31:03 - the markup
31:05 - section
31:16 - i'm gonna bring this mark up in here
31:19 - and i'm gonna put it
31:22 - down here where
31:25 - it'll probably end up being on the page
31:28 - so
31:30 - really we're gonna want this i guess
31:32 - right here
31:33 - um so some things that
31:38 - we're going to need to bring over
31:44 - things that we won't need
31:49 - i don't think we're going to need
31:51 - this
31:54 - or this
31:57 - and
31:58 - class names
32:03 - and we're not gonna be mapping over
32:05 - anything
32:07 - right now i think we're gonna hard code
32:12 - this uh at least while we're just
32:15 - getting it to work we're gonna hard code
32:17 - it
32:24 - okay
32:26 - so
32:27 - that's mostly everything that we need
32:29 - there are probably some styles you know
32:31 - living somewhere that we could bring
32:33 - over as well but
32:34 - um
32:35 - i think we have all our functions and
32:37 - all our markup
32:40 - this is actually not a bad place to stop
32:42 - we're going to do a short break i'm
32:43 - going to get some questions uh i'm going
32:46 - to scroll all the way up to the top and
32:48 - just work my way down the live chat
32:52 - matthew said nice shades jesse welcome
32:54 - to the rockstar coder club
32:57 - if you weren't here for the beginning of
32:58 - the chat i had sunglasses on so
33:01 - um
33:03 - smilers asked where's your beard
33:06 - yeah i shaved
33:07 - no more beard
33:09 - my wife always hated the beard so
33:12 - once it started to get warm it was god
33:19 - sorry about the yawn i'm i'm pretty
33:21 - tired uh i've been sick really the last
33:24 - week i've been getting worse and i
33:26 - finally went to the doctor yesterday and
33:28 - got an antibiotic
33:30 - and so hopefully i'll start feeling
33:31 - better
33:34 - just like doesn't matter what i do if i
33:37 - help doesn't matter how much i sleep or
33:39 - if i work out or don't work out i'm
33:41 - exhausted all the time
33:54 - michael asked if i had a hangover
33:56 - no no hangover
33:58 - oh i forgot to tell you all earlier i
34:01 - was invited to speak at career day for
34:04 - my son's third grade class so i did that
34:07 - today and it was awesome and i told the
34:09 - students i built websites
34:11 - and they they thought that was cool but
34:14 - as soon as i told them how to youtube
34:15 - show
34:16 - they all got really excited and wanted
34:19 - to know how many subscribers i had and
34:21 - they wanted to subscribe to my channel
34:23 - and so
34:25 - that was really fun
34:27 - and then i told them that i made some
34:29 - like little video games uh
34:32 - you know just just some html5 games and
34:35 - they all wanted to know about the games
34:38 - but they made me a card if you could see
34:41 - the card
34:43 - so they made me a nice card they all
34:45 - signed it and they gave me some
34:47 - chocolate chip cookies
34:49 - so those that was a cool experience
34:53 - uh
34:54 - sans car says i have a problem in
34:56 - android studio would you help me i've
34:58 - actually never used android studio so i
35:01 - mean i'd love to help you but i don't
35:02 - know that i'm
35:04 - gonna be able to help you that much so
35:06 - if anybody else in the live uh chat has
35:09 - used android studio you know maybe reach
35:12 - out to sam's car and
35:14 - and um
35:16 - maybe figure out what's what's going on
35:32 - frankie says why does our sensei look
35:34 - like an aviator pilot today uh cool
35:38 - that's funny you call me the sensei
35:43 - um
35:45 - uh
35:46 - desarolo says the scroll spy with react
35:49 - sounds good
35:51 - cool cool
35:55 - uh dennis asks uh should i spend my time
35:58 - to learn jquery or react
36:00 - uh
36:01 - i would learn react i mean it definitely
36:04 - depends like
36:05 - for your current job do you need to know
36:07 - more jquery or react or are you just
36:10 - learning and you could learn either one
36:13 - i would learn react i think you're gonna
36:15 - find more jobs and higher paying jobs
36:17 - knowing react but there definitely are
36:19 - still a lot of places that use jquery
36:22 - so
36:23 - you can there's work for both uh but
36:27 - i
36:29 - i think that react is
36:32 - it's a little bit more challenging but
36:34 - i have more fun with react than i than i
36:37 - did with jquery
36:45 - [Music]
36:48 - uh i'm really sorry if i'm
36:50 - mispronouncing that let me know how i
36:51 - should pronounce it but anyway they say
36:53 - i think we are in a situation where we
36:54 - have a lot of framework
36:56 - frameworks and it's going to be a little
36:58 - trouble about which framework i have to
36:59 - choose to work with which i just want to
37:01 - talk about uh react node.js and angular
37:05 - yeah i mean that's definitely a big
37:07 - decision for a developer like what
37:08 - framework am i going to
37:10 - use
37:11 - um
37:12 - some don't really have a choice because
37:14 - they have to use whatever their boss
37:16 - says they have to use
37:18 - but if you do have the choice
37:20 - it can be a difficult decision right you
37:22 - could try to learn a little bit about
37:24 - all of them
37:26 - or you could try to really become an
37:27 - expert at one
37:29 - so that's you know that's definitely a
37:30 - decision
37:32 - that needs to be made at some point
37:34 - but if you keep learning javascript just
37:37 - regular javascript
37:39 - it'll be easier and easier to switch
37:41 - into a framework at some point
37:44 - so don't feel like you have to make that
37:45 - decision too early
37:47 - uh if you're not sure just you know keep
37:49 - learning
37:50 - and uh it's once you learn a framework
37:53 - it's
37:55 - it's not that hard to switch a lot of
37:57 - the concepts are similar
37:59 - um
38:00 - even if the frameworks you know really
38:02 - different
38:04 - just the ideas behind frameworks in
38:06 - general can can transfer so you know
38:09 - don't be too worried about it it's not
38:11 - like the end of the world if you pick
38:12 - one framework and then switch a year
38:14 - later or something but
38:16 - uh i mean it's a legitimate choice you
38:18 - know but
38:19 - you know don't stress too much about it
38:21 - just
38:22 - as long as you're getting better with
38:24 - with coding like you'll learn these
38:26 - skills that
38:28 - help you pick up anything
38:30 - you know
38:31 - more quickly
38:33 - okay let me
38:36 - i'm going to write down where i
38:38 - have left off in the chat and we're
38:40 - going to do some more coding
38:42 - so let's find
38:46 - i leave off
38:53 - okay
38:54 - let me know what you all think about me
38:56 - streaming this late i probably can't do
38:58 - this every day but um
39:00 - you know i'm always trying to figure out
39:02 - what time of the day is the best to work
39:04 - with everybody's time zones i know this
39:06 - is like
39:07 - really late or really early in the
39:09 - morning for those of you in in india and
39:12 - in that time zone uh so this this may
39:15 - not be the best and then for a lot of
39:16 - you you know this is probably dinner
39:18 - time you're maybe doing your commute
39:20 - home
39:21 - i mean if that's the case you're not
39:22 - even watching you know but if you're
39:24 - gonna if you watch the recording of this
39:25 - later so uh do let me know how this
39:28 - works out for you i mean we have
39:31 - about an average amount of viewers maybe
39:33 - a little less than we had the last
39:34 - couple of streams but
39:36 - so it seems like it is working out
39:41 - but let's go
39:42 - we'll start this pomodoro session see
39:44 - how i've broken things because we don't
39:47 - have this get top coordinate
39:49 - um
39:50 - and that should be in
39:54 - where am i getting that from
39:57 - do i have a utils folder
39:59 - yeah
40:01 - nope
40:03 - where's my components
40:06 - gigatop coordinate okay
40:20 - wow
40:28 - hmm
40:35 - okay you know what let me bring over
40:40 - i'm going to create this component
40:42 - and we're going to import it
40:44 - so
40:53 - i kind of think this should be in our
40:54 - utils folder in my other project it was
40:56 - just in the regular component folder but
40:58 - i think it makes more sense here
41:00 - so let's make a new file
41:02 - and let's call this get
41:05 - top
41:08 - coordinate dot js
41:11 - and
41:12 - [Music]
41:13 - i'm going to copy and paste everything
41:16 - that we need
41:18 - okay so one thing that we don't have
41:20 - right now is low dash map values
41:24 - so i now i know for sure that i didn't
41:26 - write this because i usually don't pull
41:28 - in low dash stuff if i'm going to map
41:30 - values i just i use you know.map um
41:34 - but i don't really want to
41:36 - get into refactoring this right now so i
41:39 - am going to bring in
41:40 - uh low dash
41:43 - map values
41:45 - so
41:47 - um
41:49 - sorry i'm gonna do yarn
41:51 - add
41:54 - blow dash
41:56 - and it's not gonna be slash is it
41:58 - it's gonna be
42:01 - let me look up i can't remember what the
42:03 - uh
42:12 - yeah something gets dot
42:25 - yes it'll be low dash dot map values
42:35 - and actually is it all lowercase
42:39 - i think it is
42:48 - um
42:49 - and then we will have to change missions
42:52 - dot js
42:54 - to bring in
42:59 - our get top coordinate from
43:03 - so let's go
43:05 - um
43:08 - you two
43:12 - okay
43:14 - all right let's see if that fixes our
43:16 - error
43:18 - key is not defined where do we have this
43:21 - yes
43:22 - all right so
43:26 - now it's just a matter of figuring out
43:27 - all those things that i brought in that
43:29 - aren't really
43:31 - uh that aren't really gonna work so
43:34 - let's check out where i brought in key
43:36 - yep there we go
43:38 - um
43:40 - yeah and we don't need
43:43 - we don't need a key right now because we
43:45 - aren't going to be mapping over this
43:48 - but i would like to have more than one
43:50 - li so let's figure this out active
43:52 - section
43:54 - equals
43:56 - key and active
44:00 - maybe we will need a key
44:03 - um
44:08 - scroll to item title
44:17 - item let's figure out what we're naming
44:19 - this
44:20 - um and then we don't have title
44:24 - so instead of title we're just gonna
44:26 - make
44:27 - right now it'll be
44:30 - spring
44:31 - missions
44:34 - for now
44:35 - and
44:36 - [Music]
44:38 - class name active section equals key and
44:41 - active
44:47 - oh i'm sorry why is it
44:56 - all right i'm gonna have to go back and
44:58 - see
45:00 - what i have going on
45:12 - we're just planning god nav
45:15 - before
45:49 - okay so we were using before we were
45:52 - making the key
45:54 - just um
45:58 - a number
46:01 - so whatever number it was so we were
46:04 - mapping over this
46:06 - and we were just using like the iterator
46:07 - as the key so um
46:14 - don't really
46:16 - i'd rather not do that right now
46:20 - so basically we're saying if the active
46:22 - section
46:23 - um which was being passed down i guess
46:26 - from the state of the parent component
46:29 - so if the active section
46:32 - equaled key so it equaled whatever
46:34 - number
46:36 - then we would add the class of active
46:38 - that would give it a border
46:40 - to the left and
46:42 - uh
46:43 - increase the font weight
46:46 - um
46:48 - so we need to change this a bit because
46:51 - we're not going to we're not passing
46:53 - down these values from parent to child
46:55 - component it's all living in the same
46:56 - component for now
46:58 - so we need to change these
47:01 - uh to be named what you know what they
47:03 - ought to be named
47:05 - so let's scroll up a bit and check out
47:07 - our state and see what we've named these
47:11 - this is a little bit different than we
47:12 - usually do state usually we don't use
47:16 - this constructor but that's how we
47:18 - copied it over so we'll just work with
47:19 - it as is right now
47:24 - so it looks like
47:30 - all right so we can do this state active
47:33 - section
47:36 - we
47:36 - can do better positions
47:39 - so we do this state active section and
47:41 - then
47:44 - handle scroll
47:52 - yeah i guess we'll do this handle scroll
47:58 - let's go down here and we'll change this
48:00 - to this state
48:02 - active section
48:04 - and
48:06 - let's see what we're passed just to pass
48:08 - handle scroll
48:18 - hmm
48:28 - next
48:37 - scroll to item okay
48:40 - header
48:54 - um
48:57 - scroll into view
49:15 - so we don't even have a scroll into view
49:21 - we don't have that i'm assuming
49:24 - what's supposed to happen is the handle
49:26 - scroll
49:56 - oh wow um
50:02 - scroll into view
50:03 - [Music]
50:05 - is actually um
50:10 - a separate component
50:21 - that's wild
51:18 - sorry i'm just trying to make sense of
51:20 - this of where where this stuff is coming
51:23 - from
51:24 - so we have this scroll into view
51:29 - but i'm pretty sure this does not exist
51:31 - anywhere else in our component
51:35 - no it doesn't
51:54 - let's see
52:16 - hmm
52:56 - that's wild all right so this scroll
52:59 - into view
53:06 - we're not importing anywhere
53:10 - we don't have it anywhere else in this
53:11 - component
53:19 - and we're not actually
53:23 - i don't know what's going on so check
53:24 - this out
53:25 - so
53:26 - in this other um
53:28 - react project
53:30 - we're using scroll in the view here
53:32 - but we're not pulling it in anywhere and
53:35 - it doesn't exist anywhere else
53:38 - uh so if we do
53:39 - you know control fine
53:41 - you know
53:42 - we don't get it so scroll i n t o
53:46 - so it's just there
53:48 - i'm
53:52 - i don't know let's let's see
53:57 - let's do a search in the whole repo for
53:59 - everywhere we're using scrolling to view
54:02 - so we do have a component name scroll
54:03 - into view
54:16 - 10 routes
54:25 - oh
54:29 - wow okay so this then is um
54:34 - a container component
54:39 - wow
54:44 - okay you'll see um
54:57 - okay john hanson says scroll into view
54:59 - is a native uh js command
55:02 - oh okay that makes so much sense
55:05 - i did not know that
55:08 - i'm sorry to everybody who knew that
55:11 - and was thinking like what are you
55:12 - talking about okay um
55:15 - that makes more sense it threw me off
55:17 - that we had a component name this as
55:19 - well but now that i look at it that was
55:21 - capitalized so it definitely wasn't the
55:22 - same thing anyway
55:38 - so
55:42 - i wonder if this will work if we leave
55:44 - it out
55:51 - i'm gonna leave it out for now
55:56 - and um just trying to continue on see if
55:59 - we can get just like a working
56:03 - something working here key is not
56:05 - defined i thought we took key out did i
56:07 - not save it
56:16 - that's not what i wanted
56:20 - is this a different spot
56:22 - let me give it a refresh here and see
56:24 - key is not defined 261
56:32 - oh yeah because i'm still using key
56:34 - right there
56:36 - um
56:37 - if this state active section equals
56:41 - um
56:43 - i don't i think i'm not gonna i think
56:44 - i'm gonna use title
56:54 - let's see did we have
56:58 - reserve state
57:00 - active section
57:09 - yes i'm not going to put title i'm going
57:11 - to say it does it
57:14 - spring
57:16 - scroll to item
57:20 - spring
57:35 - okay that makes more sense
57:39 - now i'm going to put in another li
57:44 - and we're just going to change this to
57:46 - summer
57:47 - so you see we're hard coding a lot of
57:49 - this
57:50 - we'll probably end up
57:52 - going back to something that's closer to
57:54 - what we originally had
57:56 - uh but
58:01 - for now this will just simplify things
58:06 - oops want this to be capitalized
58:13 - okay
58:40 - all right we need to probably do
58:44 - yeah we need to say this
58:46 - uh dot scroll to item so we're having
58:48 - that red squiggly line there
58:52 - this dot scroll to item
58:56 - section
59:04 - okay
59:05 - all right let's see
59:08 - is prop set headers is not a function
59:11 - okay
59:14 - where are we at then let's find
59:21 - set headers
59:25 - you're right it's not
59:27 - it's going to be this
59:29 - dot set headers
59:36 - hey
59:37 - no error
59:39 - ah we we got one each is not defined
59:42 - you know what are we
59:45 - i bet each is some sort of
59:49 - i bet it's using like low dash each or
59:51 - something like that
59:53 - and that's where we're getting this
59:57 - uh i'm check on my other screen
60:00 - um this other component
60:03 - and see what we're
60:05 - pulling in
60:11 - where did we get this from handle scroll
60:44 - i don't know where we got
60:46 - handle
60:54 - i
61:00 - we got it from the
61:03 - the page
61:16 - we did you know now we did pull in low
61:18 - dash each
61:21 - so let's
61:26 - let's bring this in as here as well
61:30 - and we're going to have to go
61:32 - yarn add
61:41 - couldn't find package low dash each
61:44 - so now what it's called
61:58 - okay i think it's called low dash for
62:01 - each
62:08 - maybe
62:35 - anybody that familiar with lodash
62:59 - uh
63:12 - all right let's do
63:13 - all right you know what i can i think i
63:16 - can probably see
63:19 - where we're getting this from if i just
63:21 - check out the package.json for this uh
63:24 - resource center project
63:26 - so if you want to check out that
63:28 - resource center project on github i
63:30 - pasted the link a little bit earlier
63:32 - i'm going to paste it again
63:34 - for those of you that have come in a bit
63:36 - later on
63:37 - so you can search through this as well
63:40 - right now i'm going to look at this
63:41 - package json file and see
63:45 - i'm hoping we didn't bring in all of
63:46 - blowdash
64:25 - actually i don't see
64:29 - i don't see low dash anywhere
64:32 - how is this possible
65:02 - we're definitely using lowdash in a lot
65:05 - of components
65:09 - but
65:14 - replace ludos underscore imports with
65:16 - required functioning
65:54 - i guess we have all of lodash being
65:56 - imported
66:18 - hmm
66:45 - all right i'm not sure if four each will
66:47 - work
66:48 - but
66:49 - it's worth a shot so let's see
66:56 - no i
66:58 - still did that
67:08 - hmm
67:33 - i guess not all the pieces of load ash
67:35 - are available in different modules
67:54 - i wonder if i could just replace the
67:55 - each with a normal for each
68:16 - hey what is it in
68:37 - hmm
68:57 - all right let me my timer went off so
68:59 - let me do another five minutes and uh go
69:02 - back to the live chat
69:04 - and then i'll come back to this and
69:05 - figure out
69:08 - what's going on
69:12 - so let me scroll to
69:14 - where i left off last time
69:25 - all right frankie says just curious and
69:27 - this may be trivial however is the text
69:29 - going to be justified all right so we
69:31 - were talking about well we can't see now
69:33 - because i messed it up but um
69:35 - that section header
69:37 - um and then the the text in there so
69:43 - i don't know i
69:44 - i haven't really thought about the text
69:48 - in that particular section
69:50 - maybe i'll have to mess around with
69:52 - ways to
69:56 - align the text see which which one looks
69:59 - the best
70:09 - uh frankie says that's totally cool
70:11 - feeding the less
70:12 - affluent
70:13 - yeah it is i think that is one of the
70:16 - really cool things that the university
70:18 - does is to
70:19 - you know encourage students to take part
70:22 - in in a lot of work like that
70:24 - um
70:25 - especially
70:27 - and it really reflects well on the
70:29 - students that they're willing to give up
70:30 - you know spring break that's more like a
70:32 - vacation and a party and instead like
70:35 - use that time to serve other people so
70:38 - that's that's really cool i think they
70:40 - do a lot of good
70:43 - there's gonna be a lot of great content
70:45 - for that section of the website you know
70:47 - great images videos and stories so i i
70:49 - think it's gonna end up being one of
70:51 - like the
70:52 - really kind of the better parts of this
70:55 - site once it's finished
71:12 - all right frankie was given advice on
71:14 - the uh the heading and what to do with
71:16 - it um
71:18 - uh and then said but what do i know play
71:20 - around with it you're the expert and i'm
71:22 - learning um
71:25 - i don't know i'm the expert and uh i
71:28 - definitely value your opinion and your
71:31 - contributions to the stream so
71:33 - uh i don't know i i see it as us helping
71:36 - each other to get better
71:38 - so i mean i hope you can learn from me
71:41 - but
71:42 - um
71:44 - you know i don't want anyone to think
71:46 - that
71:47 - uh
71:48 - that i'm somehow
71:49 - you know the the expert at this you know
71:52 - and we're all just trying to do
71:55 - good work right
71:56 - um and if we can help each other then
71:59 - that's great because we'll all end up
72:00 - doing better work together than we could
72:03 - separately
72:06 - so i always welcome questions and i try
72:09 - my best to help but i also really really
72:11 - appreciate when you all help me
72:14 - uh even if it's just offering your
72:16 - opinion about how something looks that's
72:18 - really really helpful
72:45 - i was talking about shaving my beard
72:47 - earlier and i said that my wife hates
72:48 - the beard and frankie agrees uh with my
72:51 - wife all right so she'll be happy to
72:52 - hear that i know i did um on instagram a
72:55 - while back
72:56 - i did a poll and asking people if i
72:58 - should shave my beard or not and it was
73:00 - overwhelming that everyone wanted me to
73:02 - keep the beard
73:03 - and
73:04 - i joke with my wife and said like you
73:06 - should have recruited people to vote
73:07 - shave it you know
73:10 - so i have to let her know there is
73:11 - somebody else out there that thinks i'm
73:14 - i'm better without the beard
73:19 - frankie also said hopefully you'll feel
73:20 - better soon thank you i appreciate that
73:22 - i'm i'm hoping too it's the doctor asked
73:24 - me yesterday if i wanted an antibiotic
73:26 - prescribed or not
73:28 - and i said yes i know people worry about
73:31 - getting antibiotics prescribed too much
73:33 - and i understand that but i thought you
73:35 - know what i've been sick for a week
73:37 - and i don't have i got a busy week
73:39 - coming up i don't have time to come back
73:40 - to the doctor i don't want to mess with
73:42 - it i was worried i had an ear infection
73:44 - too and it's like i don't want to mess
73:46 - with that i already couldn't hear out of
73:47 - one ear
73:48 - and i'm like
73:50 - you know what i don't want to mess with
73:51 - that i don't know if it could really
73:52 - happen but having an infection that
73:54 - close to your brain kind of freaks me
73:55 - out like
73:56 - i'm not sure if an ear infection can get
73:58 - into your brain but i don't want to i
74:00 - don't want to find out
74:02 - you know
74:03 - so i thought hey we'll just get it um
74:06 - get it taken care of
74:08 - you know what i'm going to do my
74:09 - five-minute timer went up but i'm going
74:11 - to go through and answer all the
74:12 - questions right now and um
74:17 - then i'm gonna see what time it is and
74:20 - how tired i feel
74:21 - and that'll determine whether or not i
74:24 - we we have time to finish this component
74:25 - we might just do part two tomorrow
74:29 - and finish the component then
74:31 - i kind of think at this point if i just
74:33 - installed all of lodash
74:35 - that would solve the problem
74:37 - um
74:39 - so we'll see maybe maybe i'll do that
74:43 - but there may be other problems right
74:46 - after that so i i don't really know if
74:48 - this is something that i can get working
74:50 - in in just a few minutes
74:53 - and hey i have a spam caller calling me
74:56 - right now
74:57 - uh
74:58 - okay so let me keep going
75:15 - uh rohit says uh use the bootstrap
75:18 - scrolls fire or build your own
75:20 - um yeah well we're trying to build our
75:22 - own here
75:24 - um
75:27 - and this i guess is partly my problem
75:29 - you know how i like to do things i don't
75:31 - like to prepare i like to just show you
75:33 - like in reality what happens when i try
75:35 - to do uh you know something uh at work
75:39 - so i didn't take time beforehand to
75:41 - check out that other repo and see
75:43 - and
75:45 - i didn't remember how much work was
75:47 - involved in making this happen the last
75:49 - time so i underestimated the amount of
75:51 - time it would take so i i assumed that i
75:54 - could do this in one stream
75:56 - but i think it's gonna have to be a two
75:57 - stream thing so
76:00 - um
76:03 - yeah so i guess
76:04 - uh at the beginning of the stream maybe
76:07 - i was a little bit uh
76:09 - optimistic
76:11 - about how this would go
76:14 - but i i looking through this i i
76:16 - definitely think there's some
76:17 - refactoring that can happen
76:21 - to do this um
76:23 - a little bit more simply
76:25 - so maybe we'll
76:26 - maybe we'll get into that tomorrow but i
76:29 - always like to make something work first
76:31 - before i worry about refactoring you
76:33 - know because that's the most important
76:35 - part like the user doesn't care what
76:37 - your code looks like
76:39 - um you want to get it to work at some
76:41 - point you definitely want it to look
76:43 - good and if you have time to do both
76:44 - then definitely do both but
76:46 - um i'm trying to keep the user in mind
76:49 - first
76:50 - uh and then
76:53 - you know i always
76:55 - you know can go back later and do it i
76:57 - don't always do it but i could do it
77:06 - all right so adrian has a question how
77:09 - to find an internship with only basics
77:11 - of react what website should i look at
77:14 - um you know what i don't really know of
77:17 - any websites for internships
77:20 - uh does anyone know of any internship
77:22 - websites i know there are definitely
77:25 - good internships out there and some of
77:26 - the bigger tech companies actually pay
77:28 - really well for interns i've i've seen
77:31 - some things online they claim that
77:33 - um
77:35 - interns at you know facebook and google
77:37 - actually make more than i do
77:40 - um
77:41 - which is is pretty cool
77:44 - but i'm i don't know where those are
77:46 - listed at
77:48 - i mean probably somewhere on the sites
77:50 - for those companies but it'd be nicer if
77:52 - you go to one place and find everything
77:54 - listed from lots of different companies
77:56 - unfortunately i don't
77:58 - i don't know of a site like that if
78:00 - anybody knows something like that please
78:02 - put it in the uh in the live chat
78:08 - uh frankie did say be proactive send
78:10 - your email out or go directly to the
78:12 - companies that's that's definitely good
78:13 - advice
78:17 - frankie's been emailing all day
78:20 - that's the that's the way to do it
78:22 - frankie that's i mean you got to be
78:23 - proactive about that
78:27 - okay don xavier says that this is
78:30 - actually a good time for streaming right
78:32 - after dinner okay cool
78:48 - uh destroyer of world says what's the
78:50 - name of the color scheme
78:54 - um
78:58 - what is it seti that's it uh s-e-t-i
79:02 - that's my i'm assuming you're asking
79:04 - about my uh visual studio code scheme so
79:07 - it's
79:08 - the seti
79:11 - for
79:12 - for the text and for
79:14 - the ui
79:34 - all right john hanson says could handle
79:35 - scroll just keep track of unchanged
79:38 - values of scroll y
79:41 - uh
79:41 - john says sorry not much experience on
79:43 - my part with low dash all right let's
79:45 - let's check it out uh let's see handle
79:47 - scroll
79:50 - could handle scroll just keep track of
79:53 - on change i used to scroll
80:14 - hmm
80:30 - yeah there's gotta be a better way we
80:32 - can do this
80:36 - all right i'm gonna think sorry i said i
80:38 - was gonna get through the live chat
80:39 - first let me i'm gonna stop myself let's
80:41 - get to the live chat first
80:43 - um
80:46 - let's see
80:53 - let me see oh it looks like something
80:55 - happened with the stream
80:58 - because we dropped yeah we dropped a lot
81:00 - of users i mean it's entirely possible
81:03 - that uh most of you just got bored with
81:05 - me but
81:06 - it it looks like
81:08 - i missed it but something happened and
81:11 - um
81:13 - the stream data was like terrible for a
81:15 - second and then it got better
81:18 - so i apologize
81:20 - if the stream cut out
81:27 - um
81:29 - let's see
81:35 - all right let me know if if you all can
81:36 - see yeah actually i i see the point
81:40 - where everything just just totally
81:41 - dropped off
81:44 - all right sorry i didn't notice that at
81:46 - the time uh
81:48 - yeah let me know if y'all can see and
81:50 - hear me
81:51 - right now
81:52 - uh i'm down to the last question in the
81:55 - chat though um
81:59 - dinanji
82:01 - says hey jesse nice to see you right
82:03 - back i missed these sessions they
82:04 - actually helped me in my last terms uh
82:07 - computer science project awesome i'm
82:10 - really glad that they were they were
82:12 - helpful to you um yeah definitely i'm
82:14 - back uh i want to try to stream more
82:16 - regularly now and so i've taken some
82:18 - steps to make that happen more so i've
82:20 - got the new webcam
82:22 - and i think it'll make it easier for me
82:24 - to stream at home
82:26 - uh because the i was just worried about
82:28 - the quality of streaming with a laptop
82:31 - in my lap of it kind of shaking and
82:33 - getting people motion sick
82:35 - um
82:37 - so
82:39 - um
82:40 - hopefully i can i can be back and i
82:42 - would like last week i just wasn't
82:43 - feeling well when i don't feel i don't
82:45 - exercise i feel more depressed i just
82:47 - don't feel like doing much so
82:50 - um that's also part of the reason why i
82:53 - wasn't streaming so much uh last week so
82:56 - i'm gonna do my best to
82:59 - keep up with my health my exercise and
83:02 - my mental health so that i can keep
83:05 - doing streams for you all and do good
83:07 - quality streams
83:10 - um
83:11 - let's see
83:12 - all right so i'm at the bottom of the
83:13 - chat it looks like
83:15 - i'm still not sure about the video
83:17 - quality
83:19 - uh i didn't i didn't get any response
83:22 - if
83:23 - in terms of if y'all can can see and
83:25 - hear me anymore and we're still at a low
83:27 - count for viewers so
83:29 - i'm gonna
83:31 - i'm gonna be on the safe side and assume
83:32 - that there is something going on with
83:34 - the stream and so i'm gonna stop working
83:37 - on this right now
83:39 - uh i'll
83:42 - i'll probably commit what we have here
83:45 - so that you all can check it out if you
83:47 - want even though it's not working
83:51 - and then we'll pick up with this
83:52 - sometime tomorrow uh and hopefully get
83:55 - it working then
83:56 - um so let's just uh
83:59 - let me just commit this now so i don't
84:00 - forget
84:03 - so we're gonna do a git status we're
84:05 - gonna see what what we have here lots of
84:08 - stuff
84:09 - um and then we'll do a git add we'll add
84:12 - everything and let's do yarn
84:16 - you're in cm
84:18 - and
84:20 - we're gonna do feature
84:23 - and let's say
84:28 - add
84:32 - functions in
84:35 - markup for
84:39 - scroll spy
84:40 - nav to
84:45 - to mission page
84:49 - actually now i think about it i probably
84:51 - shouldn't have changed that
84:52 - i shouldn't have said mission page
84:53 - because i think we have a mission page
84:55 - for mission statement
84:57 - uh what just happened
85:02 - oh it's not gonna let me use this reps
85:04 - huh
85:09 - all right
85:10 - uh so let me
85:13 - let me get rid of some of these i'm just
85:15 - gonna comment some stuff out here
85:19 - that's giving us errors right now
85:25 - actually let's just comment out
85:28 - a lot of what what we just added
85:34 - because
85:39 - really it doesn't work i just want it to
85:41 - be in there so i can
85:44 - you know have it available
85:46 - um
85:47 - for me to load on my laptop
85:52 - so let's grab
85:58 - uh
86:00 - yeah i'm assuming this section's not
86:03 - gonna work
86:05 - oops
86:15 - normally i do not recommend just
86:17 - commenting this much code out but
86:20 - uh i do i want this committed
86:24 - um just don't have time right now to
86:26 - make it work
86:28 - because i'm most likely going to be
86:29 - working from home tomorrow on a
86:30 - different machine
86:34 - okay um
86:38 - all right
86:39 - okay cool so we brought this back
86:41 - no errors this time
86:43 - um
86:45 - let's go
86:48 - get
86:52 - let's go with the yarn cm and then we'll
86:54 - give it a retry flag
86:58 - so we won't have to type everything in
86:59 - again no
87:01 - why is it making me type it in again
87:08 - did i need two flags
87:12 - all right there we go
87:14 - no
87:15 - still have more errors on throttle is
87:18 - defined but never used like throttle
87:20 - slice headers in each
87:23 - okay
87:42 - all right hopefully this
87:44 - goes a little better all right this unit
87:46 - test went pretty quickly that's good
87:48 - news
87:51 - and then tess
87:52 - yes
87:53 - all right wonderful
87:56 - good push
87:59 - this and this might have been a better
88:01 - idea to do on a uh on a branch
88:04 - on a side branch instead of master oh
88:06 - well
88:07 - um
88:08 - okay
88:14 - cool okay frankie just said cool so
88:18 - uh it looks like
88:20 - something's still working
88:22 - all right so
88:24 - a lot of stuff's been commented out
88:26 - but it's all um
88:30 - available on github so you can check it
88:32 - out if you want to
88:34 - if anybody wants to take a shot at
88:36 - trying to make some of this work feel
88:37 - free
88:38 - uh do not feel obligated to do anything
88:42 - but if you're interested
88:44 - you know hey pull requests are always
88:46 - welcome
88:48 - and we're going to tackle this tomorrow
88:50 - i'll tell you what at this point i'm
88:52 - trying to decide between make what we
88:54 - have work or just completely redo it
88:56 - from scratch
88:59 - i'm not sure what i want to do i this is
89:02 - kind of a problem that i think would be
89:04 - really cool to try to do from scratch
89:06 - especially on a stream and figure it out
89:11 - i don't know but realistically like
89:15 - is it worth it to for that time i'm not
89:17 - sure what would take longer at this
89:18 - point
89:19 - so
89:20 - it's possible that might happen
89:24 - but for now
89:25 - it's after 6 p.m where i'm at
89:28 - i bet my wife's wondering where i am
89:31 - so i'm gonna go thank you all so much
89:33 - for watching i'm really sorry about
89:35 - whatever happened in the stream uh when
89:37 - everything dropped off
89:39 - um
89:40 - thanks for those of you that hung in
89:42 - there thank you thanks for all the
89:44 - advice
89:45 - uh i will do my best to be back for a
89:47 - stream tomorrow until then have a
89:49 - wonderful day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today i have a new webcam and i also have sunglasses on so you might be able to see in the reflection the webcam is really bright so bright that i was thinking about wearing sunglasses because it's super bright but the lights are nice they i have the lights off in my office but my face is lit up before the only lighting that i had was a small lamp that didn't really do anything and then on my other screens that you can't see when i'm streaming i tried to make them um be white so i'd use like the white theme on youtube and try to put basically just windows like chrome windows with all white backgrounds uh all around my main screen so this should be a much better solution than uh just trying to use my monitors although i'll probably end up taking the sunglasses off because they they do help with the brightness but i can't really read my code that well it's too dark but i haven't streamed for a while i had pretty crazy end of the week last week had some kind of like emergency things that needed to um needed to be fixed so i had to basically my boss and his boss had to do a presentation to a bunch of members of the board here on saturday and so i had to type something up for them and make sure that there was a fully functional demo site uh so i got all that working and i also added a proper url and ssl certificate to our wordpress installation so if you have the code locally on your machine definitely do uh do a get pull get the latest well if you have a fork then do what you need to do to get the um to update your fork and then um make sure it has the new url because it may not work to grab data from the old ip address and the reason i needed to do that is because i was running the demo site with an ssl certificate when it tried to grab the data from the ip address which of course was just http it couldn't get that data without an error popping up that hey you're trying to load you know http data on https so it took way longer to get that all set up than i thought but it's all running now and today we are going to create a scroll spy component i had a nice meeting earlier today with one of the students uh who is working on one section of this site and it would benefit them if they had a scroll sky scroll spy component so we're going to make the basic functionality for them and they can adjust it as needed also they were just offered a job which is really awesome so he's going to graduate in may and already has a job lined up so that was pretty cool and helping out on this project helped him to to get the job because although the job doesn't deal directly with frontend development they were really interested in the fact that he knew about javascript because that's something that they they need i guess they needed more people that knew about that so it may be something they add on to his job after he starts so i thought that was kind of cool that somewhat like indirectly uh you know that this project kind of helped him out in getting a job so that was really cool um let me think uh it looks like we have a decent amount of people i'm gonna take off the shades for now um so i'm gonna try to get started uh i don't think there's anything else to update you all on in terms of you know things that have happened in the site uh there's one weird thing going on with my tests my unit tests were failing so i messed around a little bit with it and now for some reason the um the index test uh the snapshot is huge like we're talking like over 50 megabytes huge so i messed something up so i may just end up removing the the test for the index page for now because it's taking forever to load uh and then just trying to figure out what was wrong with it you know sometime later so if you're having trouble with the test it's something i did i don't i don't know and uh let's see yeah so let's get into it i should probably start up ngrok before we start so some of you may remember that i was having some issues with the builtin camera so hopefully i will not have the same issues with this other webcam for some of you are asking why i have the sunglasses on it's because my new webcam has a really bright like ring light around it so i can't remember who it was but somebody recommended to me to get the uh the razer uh keo uh webcam and i did get that and so far i really like it the quality is definitely better than the one that's built into an imac or a macbook pro and the fact that it has the builtin light is really nice for me because i'm always coding in the dark so i didn't really want to invest in in extra lighting and i'm not really sure how the best way to set that up anyway so this is simple i mean obviously it's not like you're the best you can get but you know really it's not it doesn't really make sense for me to invest in all this equipment you know i'm just kind of doing this on the side i don't get any money for this so uh wouldn't necessarily be the the smartest investment all right uh world says the only thing is that the audio is out of sync okay i'm gonna have to look into how to fix that then let me um all right so i just did a google search on that and that way when the stream's over i will remember that and i'll check out that uh the search results yeah so i don't really want i don't want that to happen all the time i'm gonna try to fix that because i know it can be annoying when it's out of sync whenever i put the code up on the screen it you know you probably won't be looking at my face anymore so it won't be as big of a deal let's see so i'm switching now and let's go over let's start this pomodoro timer and so i'm going to do one pomodoro session and then we're going to take a break and we'll do some uh answer some questions in the live chat and then i'll go back and do another pomodoro session we'll see how much we can get done uh probably two pomodoro sessions is you know all i'm gonna do today you know at that point we'll probably be getting close to uh 6 p.m my time and then that's that's definitely time for me to get home and and help get the kids ready for bed all right so uh first thing i'm going to do let's see yeah let me just get rid of this index unit test for now let's delete that and then i'll get rid of the snapshot since i don't really have time to figure out why that's that's not working properly so and i don't want it to take to mess up our um our process of testing and just take forever so we're just going to get rid of that for now and uh we need to grab let me go over here on my other screen so that we can get some code because i know we've done something like this before let's check out i'm gonna pull this over on the other screen as soon as i get it get it working all right let's pull this over so i just want you all to have a visual of what this is going to look like it's going to be really simple just a little menu on the side which let me zoom out that is going to you know have a position fixed and as we scroll down the page it highlights the area that you are in the page and if we wanted to just skip to an area just press the button and it skips to the area okay so that's what to do this one's a little bit buggy actually like it's not exactly there we are we may have to improve upon that because this is not working exactly right so but this is basically how it's going to look and i need to find the github repo for this as well so let me pull this over and where are we at resource center yeah that was it let's go into our source and our views and planning guide and we'll figure out what we call this uh i i don't think we put this in a separate component so did we active section hmm okay yeah it looks like we're tracking scroll position and everything in here okay but then we we do have this planning guidelines component all right so that makes sense so i guess the first thing we'll do is add what we need to to the actual page and then we'll check out what's here in our our planning guidelines component that we'll need to bring in and use to create our own component so i'm going to move this off to my other screen so i can can look at it and then we're going gonna go in here to oh yeah it's the missions.js page so the the student who's who's been working with me um so basically they're doing like uh an internship uh with with me and then they're also working with another department on a project and so we we have uh at um this university a whole department uh dedicated to missionary work so like uh they go into places all over the world like you know really really poor areas and help with like to teach you know kids and at orphanages and you know feed the poor do a kind of stuff like that on spring break which is really kind of cool you know a lot of people on spring break they go party well our students go and um uh you know they they help the poor so it's definitely it's good but right now on the website the section for that isn't spectacular so the uh the head of that department is really nice guy he's always wanted something nicer for that and we really didn't have you know the capability or the resources to do that on the the old website uh but on this website i think it's gonna look a lot nicer and so um a group of students has been working on on doing that and uh they've been i've been kind of collaborating and just you know checking in and uh basically giving them like the whole framework and like here's what what you need to work within and i started them out on building the page with just basic html and css because that's what they're comfortable with and i said once you build it out and you like how it looks then we can convert it into react so that's where we're at right now is converting that page into react so we did some work on it this morning and i i think it's it's looking kind of nice so we should be able to see um yeah let me go to that page so we can see what's happening so we're at localhost 3000 and you all should see this page too missionary outreach so if you have that ngrok link that i uh pasted in there a little while ago and um you type at the end of it slash missionary hyphen outreach then you'll see this page and so i think it's really you know not bad like this student that has done this work is a computer science student and doesn't really have a whole lot of experience with javascript and frontend development at all so uh and just you know just this semester has gone from basically having zero experience with react at all you know to being able to build this out and um i think it's it's certain it's looking pretty good i'm not sure about this header right here let me know what you all think about this so i i told him to leave it in because i'm just not sure about it i know it's it's like i didn't want to say no automatically because it's a new design element so i want to get over that like shock of like hey i've never seen that design element in this site this particular site before and just kind of uh give it a few days and look at it but i would like your opinion on what do you think for sections having you know this kind of thing instead of like a full you know across the page strip just kind of a half you know i don't know i'm not sure about it but i would definitely uh like some some input on that but the idea is is that each one of these um these cards and uh he had a nice adaptation of the cards that we were using on the home page um each one of these you'd be able to click learn more and it would have its own page that would have videos from that particular trip pictures and then kind of maybe like a story of what happened on that trip and more information um yeah and then we'll have it on the other end on the wordpress side of things we're going to make it really easy for the people that work in that department to edit that so all the fields will be marked out so that if as soon as they add a new post it'll automatically appear in the right section on this home page and it will create its own its own page so that's what we have so far i mean i can already see a few things that maybe i would adjust just little things font size you know here and there um let me check i see a few you are bringing in or you're uh adding some some opinions here so i'm going to check it real quick while we're while we're on this page okay some some advice here on this uh this side thing frankie's saying um you know maybe it should be centered um swap swapnil says need more margin and maybe make it bigger so it's more prominent um okay so frank you saying make the the tech center oh okay you can make more margin bigger yeah i could see it being bigger would be good all right thank you i appreciate that um that feedback there so it'll probably get adjusted a bit you know at least it'll get adjusted a bit my thought was you know i'd just have text right there as another header and it wouldn't it wouldn't have any background or anything but i i do want to give this this a chance all right so what we want to do then on this page is make that that side uh navigation and it's going to be a little tricky right because it's not as simple as what we did on that last page that i showed you uh we can't just put it right here it's going to look terrible right so we need you know basically as we scroll down you know at maybe it starts to appear here so let's say it it scrolls with the page until you get here and then we go to position fixed and then it'll scroll down with you and if you scroll back up it would stop here and not go up any higher i think i think that's what we need um you know we definitely need you we definitely don't want it to to be up here so it's gonna have a little bit of different functionality but first things first let's just get some of the code over and then we can adjust it uh as as we need to so let's go in oops i've already moved it over here so look we're in this missions.js page and let's scroll down here we are so i did um let's see get initial problems yeah so i had some things in here that i had commented out for uh for the student that i'm working with just to say like here's here it is if you need it right uh at some point we'll probably we'll be pulling in data so that's why i kind of want to leave this in here even though we're not pulling in data yet so let's bring in what we have from this other component okay so we have quite a bit and i'll bring it in but then we'll uh we'll definitely need to go over it a bit okay so this is what we have and we definitely would need to bring in throttle from low dash which we are we are using elsewhere so we won't need to um uh to bring in this uh npm package and then right now we're not using this log page view so let's get rid of this and what's up with this why each is not defined i'm like thinking didn't didn't we do something similar to this already i guess we didn't i just uh have this feeling like we've done this before maybe i'm just thinking of the other project okay all right so there's definitely some things that we will need to change or at least adjust all right since we have this here are we not yeah okay so we we don't most of our markup is actually going to live in this component and not being another component uh so you can check out let me give you the link to this github page that i have on my other screen so you all can see that as well um if you click the link that i just pasted in and it doesn't work try copying and pasting it uh that'll usually work so i need to go to a different component uh in this other repo to planning guidelines and see what we're doing here there's prosthetics hmm scroll to item all right so in our component did mount for the the other component in that other repo that we're we're checking out the resource center repo um for the planning guidelines.js component we do have something extreme component did mount and um we're bringing in four slice headers from get top coordinates so we're actually bringing quite a bit more than i even realized i'm planning on dating wow this is way more complicated than i imagined i definitely didn't remember it being this complicated probably it's because uh one of you did most of the work for this component and not me that's usually uh what what it happens whenever i go back and i'm like well i don't remember doing that okay so let's add this in once i get everything on this page we'll go through it more closely and see like what does it do and what do we need to change but for now ref title id id okay um trying to find where that spring mission trips okay um um what are you gonna do is spring oops spring what am i thinking okay there we go so spring and let's give it an id of spring as well what am i use of string literals and ref attributes is deprecated okay um all right so we have it there let's just give it let's throw in another one here uh at the bottom i guess we don't need it all the way at the bottom do we let's put it down here put another one down here and let's just call this summer just so we have another one for our menu so for right now i'm okay with hard coding this uh because there's only going to be four sections uh and there's not like we're not going to add more seasons to the year right it's going to be spring summer fall and winter otherwise i would you'll probably be looping over things and adding more we will do that eventually but for now we you know that we don't need to mess with that it's just going to add some complexity that we don't really need right now okay so since we're doing that we will be able to get rid of a bit of this up here but let's let me make sure i have everything over here first also if you're asking questions and you're wondering why i'm not answering them i will answer questions in just about two minutes i like to break things up and do some code and then go and do some questions you know kind of back and forth all right so i think i have almost everything we just need this planning guide nav component okay so i'm going to bring in the markup section i'm gonna bring this mark up in here and i'm gonna put it down here where it'll probably end up being on the page so really we're gonna want this i guess right here um so some things that we're going to need to bring over things that we won't need i don't think we're going to need this or this and class names and we're not gonna be mapping over anything right now i think we're gonna hard code this uh at least while we're just getting it to work we're gonna hard code it okay so that's mostly everything that we need there are probably some styles you know living somewhere that we could bring over as well but um i think we have all our functions and all our markup this is actually not a bad place to stop we're going to do a short break i'm going to get some questions uh i'm going to scroll all the way up to the top and just work my way down the live chat matthew said nice shades jesse welcome to the rockstar coder club if you weren't here for the beginning of the chat i had sunglasses on so um smilers asked where's your beard yeah i shaved no more beard my wife always hated the beard so once it started to get warm it was god sorry about the yawn i'm i'm pretty tired uh i've been sick really the last week i've been getting worse and i finally went to the doctor yesterday and got an antibiotic and so hopefully i'll start feeling better just like doesn't matter what i do if i help doesn't matter how much i sleep or if i work out or don't work out i'm exhausted all the time michael asked if i had a hangover no no hangover oh i forgot to tell you all earlier i was invited to speak at career day for my son's third grade class so i did that today and it was awesome and i told the students i built websites and they they thought that was cool but as soon as i told them how to youtube show they all got really excited and wanted to know how many subscribers i had and they wanted to subscribe to my channel and so that was really fun and then i told them that i made some like little video games uh you know just just some html5 games and they all wanted to know about the games but they made me a card if you could see the card so they made me a nice card they all signed it and they gave me some chocolate chip cookies so those that was a cool experience uh sans car says i have a problem in android studio would you help me i've actually never used android studio so i mean i'd love to help you but i don't know that i'm gonna be able to help you that much so if anybody else in the live uh chat has used android studio you know maybe reach out to sam's car and and um maybe figure out what's what's going on frankie says why does our sensei look like an aviator pilot today uh cool that's funny you call me the sensei um uh desarolo says the scroll spy with react sounds good cool cool uh dennis asks uh should i spend my time to learn jquery or react uh i would learn react i mean it definitely depends like for your current job do you need to know more jquery or react or are you just learning and you could learn either one i would learn react i think you're gonna find more jobs and higher paying jobs knowing react but there definitely are still a lot of places that use jquery so you can there's work for both uh but i i think that react is it's a little bit more challenging but i have more fun with react than i than i did with jquery uh i'm really sorry if i'm mispronouncing that let me know how i should pronounce it but anyway they say i think we are in a situation where we have a lot of framework frameworks and it's going to be a little trouble about which framework i have to choose to work with which i just want to talk about uh react node.js and angular yeah i mean that's definitely a big decision for a developer like what framework am i going to use um some don't really have a choice because they have to use whatever their boss says they have to use but if you do have the choice it can be a difficult decision right you could try to learn a little bit about all of them or you could try to really become an expert at one so that's you know that's definitely a decision that needs to be made at some point but if you keep learning javascript just regular javascript it'll be easier and easier to switch into a framework at some point so don't feel like you have to make that decision too early uh if you're not sure just you know keep learning and uh it's once you learn a framework it's it's not that hard to switch a lot of the concepts are similar um even if the frameworks you know really different just the ideas behind frameworks in general can can transfer so you know don't be too worried about it it's not like the end of the world if you pick one framework and then switch a year later or something but uh i mean it's a legitimate choice you know but you know don't stress too much about it just as long as you're getting better with with coding like you'll learn these skills that help you pick up anything you know more quickly okay let me i'm going to write down where i have left off in the chat and we're going to do some more coding so let's find i leave off okay let me know what you all think about me streaming this late i probably can't do this every day but um you know i'm always trying to figure out what time of the day is the best to work with everybody's time zones i know this is like really late or really early in the morning for those of you in in india and in that time zone uh so this this may not be the best and then for a lot of you you know this is probably dinner time you're maybe doing your commute home i mean if that's the case you're not even watching you know but if you're gonna if you watch the recording of this later so uh do let me know how this works out for you i mean we have about an average amount of viewers maybe a little less than we had the last couple of streams but so it seems like it is working out but let's go we'll start this pomodoro session see how i've broken things because we don't have this get top coordinate um and that should be in where am i getting that from do i have a utils folder yeah nope where's my components gigatop coordinate okay wow hmm okay you know what let me bring over i'm going to create this component and we're going to import it so i kind of think this should be in our utils folder in my other project it was just in the regular component folder but i think it makes more sense here so let's make a new file and let's call this get top coordinate dot js and i'm going to copy and paste everything that we need okay so one thing that we don't have right now is low dash map values so i now i know for sure that i didn't write this because i usually don't pull in low dash stuff if i'm going to map values i just i use you know.map um but i don't really want to get into refactoring this right now so i am going to bring in uh low dash map values so um sorry i'm gonna do yarn add blow dash and it's not gonna be slash is it it's gonna be let me look up i can't remember what the uh yeah something gets dot yes it'll be low dash dot map values and actually is it all lowercase i think it is um and then we will have to change missions dot js to bring in our get top coordinate from so let's go um you two okay all right let's see if that fixes our error key is not defined where do we have this yes all right so now it's just a matter of figuring out all those things that i brought in that aren't really uh that aren't really gonna work so let's check out where i brought in key yep there we go um yeah and we don't need we don't need a key right now because we aren't going to be mapping over this but i would like to have more than one li so let's figure this out active section equals key and active maybe we will need a key um scroll to item title item let's figure out what we're naming this um and then we don't have title so instead of title we're just gonna make right now it'll be spring missions for now and class name active section equals key and active oh i'm sorry why is it all right i'm gonna have to go back and see what i have going on we're just planning god nav before okay so we were using before we were making the key just um a number so whatever number it was so we were mapping over this and we were just using like the iterator as the key so um don't really i'd rather not do that right now so basically we're saying if the active section um which was being passed down i guess from the state of the parent component so if the active section equaled key so it equaled whatever number then we would add the class of active that would give it a border to the left and uh increase the font weight um so we need to change this a bit because we're not going to we're not passing down these values from parent to child component it's all living in the same component for now so we need to change these uh to be named what you know what they ought to be named so let's scroll up a bit and check out our state and see what we've named these this is a little bit different than we usually do state usually we don't use this constructor but that's how we copied it over so we'll just work with it as is right now so it looks like all right so we can do this state active section we can do better positions so we do this state active section and then handle scroll yeah i guess we'll do this handle scroll let's go down here and we'll change this to this state active section and let's see what we're passed just to pass handle scroll hmm next scroll to item okay header um scroll into view so we don't even have a scroll into view we don't have that i'm assuming what's supposed to happen is the handle scroll oh wow um scroll into view is actually um a separate component that's wild sorry i'm just trying to make sense of this of where where this stuff is coming from so we have this scroll into view but i'm pretty sure this does not exist anywhere else in our component no it doesn't let's see hmm that's wild all right so this scroll into view we're not importing anywhere we don't have it anywhere else in this component and we're not actually i don't know what's going on so check this out so in this other um react project we're using scroll in the view here but we're not pulling it in anywhere and it doesn't exist anywhere else uh so if we do you know control fine you know we don't get it so scroll i n t o so it's just there i'm i don't know let's let's see let's do a search in the whole repo for everywhere we're using scrolling to view so we do have a component name scroll into view 10 routes oh wow okay so this then is um a container component wow okay you'll see um okay john hanson says scroll into view is a native uh js command oh okay that makes so much sense i did not know that i'm sorry to everybody who knew that and was thinking like what are you talking about okay um that makes more sense it threw me off that we had a component name this as well but now that i look at it that was capitalized so it definitely wasn't the same thing anyway so i wonder if this will work if we leave it out i'm gonna leave it out for now and um just trying to continue on see if we can get just like a working something working here key is not defined i thought we took key out did i not save it that's not what i wanted is this a different spot let me give it a refresh here and see key is not defined 261 oh yeah because i'm still using key right there um if this state active section equals um i don't i think i'm not gonna i think i'm gonna use title let's see did we have reserve state active section yes i'm not going to put title i'm going to say it does it spring scroll to item spring okay that makes more sense now i'm going to put in another li and we're just going to change this to summer so you see we're hard coding a lot of this we'll probably end up going back to something that's closer to what we originally had uh but for now this will just simplify things oops want this to be capitalized okay all right we need to probably do yeah we need to say this uh dot scroll to item so we're having that red squiggly line there this dot scroll to item section okay all right let's see is prop set headers is not a function okay where are we at then let's find set headers you're right it's not it's going to be this dot set headers hey no error ah we we got one each is not defined you know what are we i bet each is some sort of i bet it's using like low dash each or something like that and that's where we're getting this uh i'm check on my other screen um this other component and see what we're pulling in where did we get this from handle scroll i don't know where we got handle i we got it from the the page we did you know now we did pull in low dash each so let's let's bring this in as here as well and we're going to have to go yarn add couldn't find package low dash each so now what it's called okay i think it's called low dash for each maybe anybody that familiar with lodash uh all right let's do all right you know what i can i think i can probably see where we're getting this from if i just check out the package.json for this uh resource center project so if you want to check out that resource center project on github i pasted the link a little bit earlier i'm going to paste it again for those of you that have come in a bit later on so you can search through this as well right now i'm going to look at this package json file and see i'm hoping we didn't bring in all of blowdash actually i don't see i don't see low dash anywhere how is this possible we're definitely using lowdash in a lot of components but replace ludos underscore imports with required functioning i guess we have all of lodash being imported hmm all right i'm not sure if four each will work but it's worth a shot so let's see no i still did that hmm i guess not all the pieces of load ash are available in different modules i wonder if i could just replace the each with a normal for each hey what is it in hmm all right let me my timer went off so let me do another five minutes and uh go back to the live chat and then i'll come back to this and figure out what's going on so let me scroll to where i left off last time all right frankie says just curious and this may be trivial however is the text going to be justified all right so we were talking about well we can't see now because i messed it up but um that section header um and then the the text in there so i don't know i i haven't really thought about the text in that particular section maybe i'll have to mess around with ways to align the text see which which one looks the best uh frankie says that's totally cool feeding the less affluent yeah it is i think that is one of the really cool things that the university does is to you know encourage students to take part in in a lot of work like that um especially and it really reflects well on the students that they're willing to give up you know spring break that's more like a vacation and a party and instead like use that time to serve other people so that's that's really cool i think they do a lot of good there's gonna be a lot of great content for that section of the website you know great images videos and stories so i i think it's gonna end up being one of like the really kind of the better parts of this site once it's finished all right frankie was given advice on the uh the heading and what to do with it um uh and then said but what do i know play around with it you're the expert and i'm learning um i don't know i'm the expert and uh i definitely value your opinion and your contributions to the stream so uh i don't know i i see it as us helping each other to get better so i mean i hope you can learn from me but um you know i don't want anyone to think that uh that i'm somehow you know the the expert at this you know and we're all just trying to do good work right um and if we can help each other then that's great because we'll all end up doing better work together than we could separately so i always welcome questions and i try my best to help but i also really really appreciate when you all help me uh even if it's just offering your opinion about how something looks that's really really helpful i was talking about shaving my beard earlier and i said that my wife hates the beard and frankie agrees uh with my wife all right so she'll be happy to hear that i know i did um on instagram a while back i did a poll and asking people if i should shave my beard or not and it was overwhelming that everyone wanted me to keep the beard and i joke with my wife and said like you should have recruited people to vote shave it you know so i have to let her know there is somebody else out there that thinks i'm i'm better without the beard frankie also said hopefully you'll feel better soon thank you i appreciate that i'm i'm hoping too it's the doctor asked me yesterday if i wanted an antibiotic prescribed or not and i said yes i know people worry about getting antibiotics prescribed too much and i understand that but i thought you know what i've been sick for a week and i don't have i got a busy week coming up i don't have time to come back to the doctor i don't want to mess with it i was worried i had an ear infection too and it's like i don't want to mess with that i already couldn't hear out of one ear and i'm like you know what i don't want to mess with that i don't know if it could really happen but having an infection that close to your brain kind of freaks me out like i'm not sure if an ear infection can get into your brain but i don't want to i don't want to find out you know so i thought hey we'll just get it um get it taken care of you know what i'm going to do my fiveminute timer went up but i'm going to go through and answer all the questions right now and um then i'm gonna see what time it is and how tired i feel and that'll determine whether or not i we we have time to finish this component we might just do part two tomorrow and finish the component then i kind of think at this point if i just installed all of lodash that would solve the problem um so we'll see maybe maybe i'll do that but there may be other problems right after that so i i don't really know if this is something that i can get working in in just a few minutes and hey i have a spam caller calling me right now uh okay so let me keep going uh rohit says uh use the bootstrap scrolls fire or build your own um yeah well we're trying to build our own here um and this i guess is partly my problem you know how i like to do things i don't like to prepare i like to just show you like in reality what happens when i try to do uh you know something uh at work so i didn't take time beforehand to check out that other repo and see and i didn't remember how much work was involved in making this happen the last time so i underestimated the amount of time it would take so i i assumed that i could do this in one stream but i think it's gonna have to be a two stream thing so um yeah so i guess uh at the beginning of the stream maybe i was a little bit uh optimistic about how this would go but i i looking through this i i definitely think there's some refactoring that can happen to do this um a little bit more simply so maybe we'll maybe we'll get into that tomorrow but i always like to make something work first before i worry about refactoring you know because that's the most important part like the user doesn't care what your code looks like um you want to get it to work at some point you definitely want it to look good and if you have time to do both then definitely do both but um i'm trying to keep the user in mind first uh and then you know i always you know can go back later and do it i don't always do it but i could do it all right so adrian has a question how to find an internship with only basics of react what website should i look at um you know what i don't really know of any websites for internships uh does anyone know of any internship websites i know there are definitely good internships out there and some of the bigger tech companies actually pay really well for interns i've i've seen some things online they claim that um interns at you know facebook and google actually make more than i do um which is is pretty cool but i'm i don't know where those are listed at i mean probably somewhere on the sites for those companies but it'd be nicer if you go to one place and find everything listed from lots of different companies unfortunately i don't i don't know of a site like that if anybody knows something like that please put it in the uh in the live chat uh frankie did say be proactive send your email out or go directly to the companies that's that's definitely good advice frankie's been emailing all day that's the that's the way to do it frankie that's i mean you got to be proactive about that okay don xavier says that this is actually a good time for streaming right after dinner okay cool uh destroyer of world says what's the name of the color scheme um what is it seti that's it uh seti that's my i'm assuming you're asking about my uh visual studio code scheme so it's the seti for for the text and for the ui all right john hanson says could handle scroll just keep track of unchanged values of scroll y uh john says sorry not much experience on my part with low dash all right let's let's check it out uh let's see handle scroll could handle scroll just keep track of on change i used to scroll hmm yeah there's gotta be a better way we can do this all right i'm gonna think sorry i said i was gonna get through the live chat first let me i'm gonna stop myself let's get to the live chat first um let's see let me see oh it looks like something happened with the stream because we dropped yeah we dropped a lot of users i mean it's entirely possible that uh most of you just got bored with me but it it looks like i missed it but something happened and um the stream data was like terrible for a second and then it got better so i apologize if the stream cut out um let's see all right let me know if if you all can see yeah actually i i see the point where everything just just totally dropped off all right sorry i didn't notice that at the time uh yeah let me know if y'all can see and hear me right now uh i'm down to the last question in the chat though um dinanji says hey jesse nice to see you right back i missed these sessions they actually helped me in my last terms uh computer science project awesome i'm really glad that they were they were helpful to you um yeah definitely i'm back uh i want to try to stream more regularly now and so i've taken some steps to make that happen more so i've got the new webcam and i think it'll make it easier for me to stream at home uh because the i was just worried about the quality of streaming with a laptop in my lap of it kind of shaking and getting people motion sick um so um hopefully i can i can be back and i would like last week i just wasn't feeling well when i don't feel i don't exercise i feel more depressed i just don't feel like doing much so um that's also part of the reason why i wasn't streaming so much uh last week so i'm gonna do my best to keep up with my health my exercise and my mental health so that i can keep doing streams for you all and do good quality streams um let's see all right so i'm at the bottom of the chat it looks like i'm still not sure about the video quality uh i didn't i didn't get any response if in terms of if y'all can can see and hear me anymore and we're still at a low count for viewers so i'm gonna i'm gonna be on the safe side and assume that there is something going on with the stream and so i'm gonna stop working on this right now uh i'll i'll probably commit what we have here so that you all can check it out if you want even though it's not working and then we'll pick up with this sometime tomorrow uh and hopefully get it working then um so let's just uh let me just commit this now so i don't forget so we're gonna do a git status we're gonna see what what we have here lots of stuff um and then we'll do a git add we'll add everything and let's do yarn you're in cm and we're gonna do feature and let's say add functions in markup for scroll spy nav to to mission page actually now i think about it i probably shouldn't have changed that i shouldn't have said mission page because i think we have a mission page for mission statement uh what just happened oh it's not gonna let me use this reps huh all right uh so let me let me get rid of some of these i'm just gonna comment some stuff out here that's giving us errors right now actually let's just comment out a lot of what what we just added because really it doesn't work i just want it to be in there so i can you know have it available um for me to load on my laptop so let's grab uh yeah i'm assuming this section's not gonna work oops normally i do not recommend just commenting this much code out but uh i do i want this committed um just don't have time right now to make it work because i'm most likely going to be working from home tomorrow on a different machine okay um all right okay cool so we brought this back no errors this time um let's go get let's go with the yarn cm and then we'll give it a retry flag so we won't have to type everything in again no why is it making me type it in again did i need two flags all right there we go no still have more errors on throttle is defined but never used like throttle slice headers in each okay all right hopefully this goes a little better all right this unit test went pretty quickly that's good news and then tess yes all right wonderful good push this and this might have been a better idea to do on a uh on a branch on a side branch instead of master oh well um okay cool okay frankie just said cool so uh it looks like something's still working all right so a lot of stuff's been commented out but it's all um available on github so you can check it out if you want to if anybody wants to take a shot at trying to make some of this work feel free uh do not feel obligated to do anything but if you're interested you know hey pull requests are always welcome and we're going to tackle this tomorrow i'll tell you what at this point i'm trying to decide between make what we have work or just completely redo it from scratch i'm not sure what i want to do i this is kind of a problem that i think would be really cool to try to do from scratch especially on a stream and figure it out i don't know but realistically like is it worth it to for that time i'm not sure what would take longer at this point so it's possible that might happen but for now it's after 6 p.m where i'm at i bet my wife's wondering where i am so i'm gonna go thank you all so much for watching i'm really sorry about whatever happened in the stream uh when everything dropped off um thanks for those of you that hung in there thank you thanks for all the advice uh i will do my best to be back for a stream tomorrow until then have a wonderful day
