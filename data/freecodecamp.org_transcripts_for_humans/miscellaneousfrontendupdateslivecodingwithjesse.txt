With timestamps:

00:05 - hey everybody it's
00:07 - Jesse and uh if you saw the description
00:10 - for this video it's very
00:13 - vague because today as you can see I
00:17 - have my to-do list up and I just need to
00:19 - get through some of this stuff normally
00:21 - I try to pick out something that I
00:24 - haven't done before or that I think
00:26 - might be interesting and I I do that
00:29 - during my streaming time but there's
00:31 - really not much left on the to-do list
00:33 - that I think is really that interesting
00:36 - the link to this Trello board is in the
00:38 - description you can check it out if you
00:40 - see something in one of these three
00:42 - columns that hasn't been done yet that
00:44 - sounds really interesting let me know in
00:47 - the live chat or even in the comments to
00:50 - the video if I if you comment if you're
00:52 - watching the recording and you comment
00:53 - before I'm done with this site then
00:55 - maybe I could do it but for now I've
00:58 - just been working on some of these
01:00 - didn't get to do as much as I had hoped
01:02 - today because I had some meetings this
01:05 - morning
01:07 - and can't I I always don't like when I
01:10 - have a lot of meetings because it just
01:12 - feels like I don't get anything done uh
01:14 - I'm sure the important stuff does get
01:16 - done in meetings but you just can't see
01:20 - it I'm going to check the live chat here
01:22 - before we get into any
01:25 - code hey everybody
01:31 - a lot of people saying hi in the live
01:35 - chat all right Peter says you he usually
01:38 - joins in about an hour after the stream
01:40 - starts but this time he is early so
01:44 - awesome okay
01:49 - uh okay Jaden asks what are you doing
01:52 - now all right so I'll show you what I
01:53 - was just working on um right before
01:59 - this stream started uh so
02:02 - basically I was working on this add
02:05 - adding images to the resource section
02:08 - so we uh I think I streamed some of
02:12 - this before um I mean we've definitely
02:15 - streamed a lot from that section that
02:17 - Resource page we're doing a lot on there
02:19 - so let me show you what I've done and uh
02:22 - I'm on if you're following the the
02:24 - GitHub repo I'm on the branch for uh
02:26 - called resource
02:28 - images uh so so the stuff isn't in the
02:31 - master Branch yet it's not live yet but
02:34 - basically I I just pulled in these
02:36 - images and everything's working like I
02:39 - wanted it to I'll show you how I did
02:40 - this in a second but what I was doing
02:43 - was I was checking the width of the
02:45 - image and if the image width was less
02:49 - than 600 pixels then I not displaying it
02:55 - because at at some point I think when
02:58 - you get down to like here
03:00 - then this image is almost 600 pixels
03:02 - there so I need it to look good um at
03:05 - some point it would be nice to optimize
03:07 - it even further maybe and use some
03:09 - responsive images but that's not really
03:11 - necessary at this point uh at least you
03:15 - know it's more important just to get the
03:16 - images up at this point than to really
03:18 - be nitpicky about the
03:19 - speed um but here's the problem when I
03:22 - scroll down here these
03:25 - images are I mean these don't look like
03:28 - they're 600 pixel images they look all
03:30 - stretched out uh so and especially you
03:34 - know if you zoom in like you can really
03:36 - tell so somebody's looking at this on
03:39 - the small
03:41 - screen like this let me scroll down to
03:45 - here I mean look that's just not that
03:48 - doesn't look good now this is what I was
03:49 - trying to avoid by setting that that
03:52 - limit uh or that minimum width so I'm
03:56 - waiting on some information back from
04:00 - the person who uploads the images so
04:03 - what I'm
04:04 - thinking I'm basically when I go to look
04:07 - at the uh at the data I'm getting from
04:12 - WordPress which I'll show you here what
04:14 - I'm getting um if there is an image it
04:18 - shows up like this so a better featured
04:20 - image and it has it gives me the width
04:22 - of the original image so all of these
04:25 - images are showing that the original
04:28 - image has this a width of at least 600
04:31 - pixels and then when I go
04:34 - to let me show you the one that that I
04:36 - just showed you that's not
04:40 - really great
04:42 - quality so this
04:47 - link should this will take me to the
04:50 - image the full image that's supposed to
04:53 - be 666 pixels
04:57 - wide okay look that's definitely
05:00 - you know a wide image but that's not
05:02 - quality so what what I think happened
05:05 - maybe is that when I I had sent an email
05:08 - saying you know if you're going to
05:09 - upload pictures make sure they're 600
05:11 - pixels wide at least or they're not
05:13 - going to show up so what I think
05:15 - happened
05:17 - is um they resized the images so they
05:20 - took the small images and just resized
05:22 - them to 600 pixels and then uploaded
05:25 - them which of course is not it it's
05:28 - going to look like this so I'm waiting
05:30 - for
05:31 - confirmation um back that that is in
05:34 - fact what happened and if that's the
05:35 - case I'll just have to provide clear
05:37 - instructions that we don't want the
05:38 - images resized as soon as I hear back
05:41 - from that one way or the other then I
05:43 - can merge this with uh the master branch
05:46 - and I can make it live I'm not like
05:49 - thrilled how this
05:51 - looks
05:53 - so I don't know maybe I'll take I won't
05:56 - include these images unless I have them
05:58 - all for all of these these I don't know
06:01 - what do you think to me like this this
06:02 - just looks really weird that you know
06:05 - this is very small
06:06 - and these are now huge also I'm not sure
06:10 - about when I go down you know to like
06:12 - this size so this would be more like
06:14 - somebody on their
06:16 - phone I don't even know if I want to
06:18 - have images on this side this is ends up
06:20 - being a really long scroll I mean
06:22 - there's only a few images but if you can
06:24 - imagine like what if most of these had
06:27 - images you'd be scrolling forever
06:30 - I'm thinking of maybe just not doing any
06:33 - images for small screens load times will
06:37 - be much better which is great because if
06:39 - you're on your mobile and you're on your
06:40 - data plan you don't want to load a bunch
06:41 - of images anyway so let me know what you
06:44 - think about that I'm I'm still undecided
06:46 - as of yet so uh your your input would be
06:52 - very much appreciated all right so I'm
06:54 - just going to switch to another branch
06:55 - and work on something else uh until I I
06:58 - hear back so I don't even know if I'll
07:00 - hear back today uh or if it'll be until
07:03 - next week so I would I kind of hoped
07:05 - that I could get this going and get this
07:06 - live today but uh we'll see I definitely
07:10 - don't want it to be live with those
07:11 - images looking uh like that so trying to
07:15 - find my console here so I'm thinking
07:17 - about just switching back I moved this
07:20 - into like the testing area just so that
07:22 - I know it's basically done I'm just
07:25 - waiting on on some info
07:27 - here I was thinking about going back to
07:30 - that search bar uh so we got this
07:33 - working and uh remember there are just a
07:36 - few optimizations that I wanted to make
07:38 - and I didn't do any styling on the
07:40 - search bar at all so it definitely it
07:42 - doesn't look like I want it to look so I
07:44 - was thinking about switching back to
07:45 - this branch and just doing that so if
07:48 - there's any objections to going back and
07:51 - finishing up with this uh search page
07:54 - let me know I know we did spend a while
07:55 - on that before so uh if you're tired of
07:58 - that tell me maybe I can find something
08:01 - else to do I just looks like I got a
08:04 - bunch of stuff in the live stream so I'm
08:06 - going to check the live stream
08:09 - now really quickly just to see if you uh
08:13 - have some feedback for me before we
08:18 - start okay so uh Asar says is Fabian
08:22 - here today to save Jesse and uh yeah in
08:25 - case you haven't seen the past few
08:27 - streams uh Fabian
08:30 - uh and I'm not even sure if I'm
08:31 - pronouncing your name right Fabian so if
08:32 - you hear this uh let me know cuz he's
08:36 - from Paris so maybe it's more like
08:38 - Fabian or something like that I don't
08:41 - really know
08:43 - um he did save me he submitted a pool
08:46 - request and it was just awesome and um
08:49 - his way to deal with the problem I was
08:51 - dealing with was way better than my way
08:52 - and it worked and um and then he
08:55 - actually joined in the next day in the
08:56 - Stream and and basically step byep that
08:59 - like coached me through how to get the
09:01 - search function to work so super helpful
09:06 - uh but I don't know if he's here today
09:08 - he hasn't said anything in the live chat
09:09 - so we'll see hopefully he is here and uh
09:12 - a lot of the stuff I'm going to be doing
09:14 - today isn't like super difficult stuff
09:16 - so I don't think I'll get stuck to the
09:19 - point where I'm just I'm totally
09:23 - lost um
09:31 - uh mamadu says hello what is it about
09:34 - this
09:36 - live I'm not sure I'm not sure what
09:39 - you're asking so
09:41 - um if you can clarify that for me that
09:43 - would be great and I'll I'll try to
09:55 - answer okay Rohan says uh you put images
09:58 - on the left or right side just color the
10:01 - card the color of the image
10:04 - uh Philly says why not make the images
10:07 - only appear when you hover the mouse
10:10 - okay that's possible you should add
10:12 - hyperlinks for the images David says you
10:14 - should hyper links um Rohan thinks it
10:18 - would be too abrupt to add the
10:22 - hover oh vet said made a few fixes for f
10:27 - marcom okay so we got another Pool
10:29 - request I will check that out um I'll
10:32 - check that out after the stream uh let
10:34 - me know what what parts of the site are
10:36 - they fixes for
10:38 - because uh if you could just quickly let
10:41 - me know in the live stream that way I
10:43 - won't try to mess with them right now
10:45 - and uh you know do the work that you've
10:47 - just done but I really appreciate that
10:48 - and I will check that out as soon as I'm
10:50 - done
11:02 - oh John says use flex justify to stretch
11:06 - uh justify content stretch to fill the
11:08 - heights um and then change with media
11:11 - queries I I have I actually was doing
11:14 - something like that before I wasn't
11:16 - using Flex
11:19 - because the the way that I have the
11:21 - cards now in the columns it
11:25 - um it didn't work right basically like I
11:31 - well I should say it it was easier I
11:35 - don't I'm not it's hard for me to
11:37 - describe how I did it but basically I
11:38 - did something very similar to that uh
11:40 - John's suggestion was to you know like
11:42 - fill the Heights and make them the the
11:44 - same height so uh I might go back to
11:47 - that if I I'll see I'll play with some
11:52 - stuff uh like I said but I'm not going
11:54 - to mess with it anymore until I um until
11:57 - I hear back about what's going on with
11:58 - those images
12:04 - all right thanks V yeah I figured you
12:06 - added a description in the pool request
12:07 - V says he had a description I just
12:10 - wanted like just like a very quick what
12:12 - are they about cuz
12:14 - um I I didn't want to like go over the
12:17 - uh the request um during the live
12:27 - stream wow okay awesome v um it seems
12:32 - like he did a lot of stuff I'm
12:33 - definitely going to check that
12:40 - out uh please says uh W wahaj says
12:45 - Please add some black
12:49 - UI where you want to add the black
12:53 - UI Andre asks about the Trello power
12:56 - power up oh yeah the Trello power up
13:01 - is I added it so long ago I don't even
13:05 - remember what it was let's see what I
13:07 - have
13:10 - activated
13:14 - um it's not
13:17 - even why is it not showing
13:21 - up you know what maybe it's not a
13:23 - PowerUp maybe it's um this might be a
13:25 - browser plugin
13:31 - let see B all right it's called burndown
13:34 - for Trello and I think it's actually a
13:38 - browser plugin and not a not a power up
13:41 - in Trello so I'm using the free version
13:45 - it works for me uh full version lets you
13:47 - do cool stuff with
13:49 - charts like burn down charts and things
13:52 - all right so let me get to work uh I'm
13:54 - going to do this there were no
13:55 - objections uh that I saw to working on
13:57 - the search so I'm going to go to that
13:59 - that's probably is the most like
14:00 - technically challenging thing on the
14:02 - list right now uh so maybe that would be
14:05 - more appealing uh to everyone especially
14:08 - uh for those of you who are a little bit
14:10 - more advanced uh it it would be more
14:12 - appealing some of this other stuff is
14:13 - just really
14:15 - basic uh so let me switch to that
14:27 - Branch there we go live search okay so
14:30 - switch to the live search
14:33 - branch and I always get
14:39 - weird I said not always I often get an
14:42 - error when I switch try to switch
14:48 - branches there we go and I just need to
14:50 - manually refresh uh it's something with
14:54 - a hot module
14:55 - reloading uh messes up when I switch
14:59 - so so we got the resources page here's
15:03 - our search bar in case you didn't see
15:05 - when we made this search bar uh
15:07 - basically as soon as we search for
15:10 - anything uh we
15:12 - have um like a live search let me search
15:15 - for something that's legit okay so we
15:18 - have
15:21 - uh you know this actually has I've typed
15:23 - in the first part of this name so it
15:25 - actually shows up there uh and then not
15:27 - only that if I clicked on these it would
15:29 - keep whatever I searched for and then I
15:31 - could sort by these same categories so
15:34 - it keeps all the Sorting I thought I
15:36 - added a in height maybe I just talked
15:38 - about adding a in height and didn't do
15:40 - it I think I did add it to Trello though
15:41 - so
15:43 - um actually that's a good one to start
15:46 - with I can at least get something
15:47 - checked off the list let me
15:51 - see let me see if I added this
16:03 - I guess I didn't I didn't even add it to
16:05 - Trello so I probably just forgot about
16:07 - it completely maybe that was one of the
16:08 - days where I had to leave like
16:10 - immediately or go to a meeting
16:11 - immediately after the stream there was
16:14 - one stream where I really pushed it and
16:15 - I ended the stream at like 2:59 and I
16:17 - had a meeting at 3: and I had to just
16:19 - run
16:20 - over
16:22 - uh all right so basically I want to add
16:25 - here's what I want to do and this is
16:26 - easy I don't like that when I type
16:28 - something in and there's nothing it just
16:31 - totally shrinks up like this so I'm
16:32 - going to add a Min height I did have I
16:34 - remember some other suggestions about
16:36 - animating this transitions but um for
16:39 - now I'm just going to add a Min height
16:41 - uh because as I mentioned before in an
16:43 - earlier project uh it's getting to the
16:45 - point where I just like I need to be
16:47 - done I think uh people you know higher
16:50 - up than me my bosses and their bosses
16:52 - are thinking like you know why is this
16:54 - project dragging on they haven't said it
16:56 - like that but that's the feeling that
16:58 - I'm getting so
16:59 - uh I need to just finish it
17:01 - up and I don't want to spend like 13
17:05 - hours a day like I was doing trying to
17:07 - get this finished so I got to just
17:10 - be I got to just use some judgment on
17:12 - what's what's really necessary and
17:14 - what's just kind of more nitpicky uh to
17:16 - do so let me go to the
17:18 - code
17:20 - here where I'm at
17:23 - resources
17:26 - and I am using next
17:29 - also I'm not I'm not watching the live
17:31 - chat like really diligently right now so
17:34 - I'm going to be going back and forth but
17:36 - I'd like to maybe uh complete a task and
17:38 - then go back to the chat and uh just go
17:41 - back and forth like that uh for maybe
17:43 - like an hour or 45 minutes and then I'll
17:45 - I'll go back to the chat and I'll answer
17:49 - questions um let's
17:52 - see actually yeah today
17:56 - uh as I'm looking for this I I'm going
17:59 - to fill you in on some of the um some of
18:02 - the stuff that's been happening here uh
18:04 - since this this show is about just the
18:06 - day-to-day job that I'm doing as a
18:08 - front-end developer uh
18:11 - so I like to fill you in on some of the
18:13 - other stuff that happens when I'm not
18:14 - live streaming just to give you a better
18:16 - picture of what my job is like I don't
18:19 - really know if this is my job is a good
18:21 - example what frontend developers jobs
18:23 - are normally like or not I work at a
18:25 - university so um I imagine a lot of
18:28 - universities do need Developers for
18:29 - their sites so in that sense it's maybe
18:32 - like that but probably not like a tech
18:34 - company would have uh I think this is
18:37 - the column the row that we need actually
18:41 - need more than the row I like the
18:42 - section to have
18:44 - a so if you haven't worked with react
18:47 - before this is going to freak you out to
18:48 - put the CSS right here um but I'm going
18:52 - to do it here I could also put it here
18:55 - okay so I have been using this you know
18:58 - style J X tag and I can write the CSS
19:02 - just like regular CSS in
19:06 - here um but if I'm going to do something
19:10 - to just one
19:11 - element I usually just put it in line I
19:15 - there's there's no point in me just
19:17 - doing it down here if it's only applying
19:19 - to one element at least that's that's
19:20 - the way I feel it's easier for me to see
19:22 - immediately what's happening because
19:24 - it's right here I don't have to like
19:26 - look at the class and then go down here
19:28 - and figure fig it out so I'm sure there
19:30 - are other opinions and pros and cons to
19:32 - doing it a different way but that's how
19:34 - I'm going to do it so um I can just type
19:38 - in
19:40 - style and I'm explaining this in case
19:42 - you know there might be some people
19:44 - watching that aren't familiar at all
19:45 - with with react or anything so I'm kind
19:47 - of explaining some things that I know
19:49 - I've explained before might be some
19:50 - basic to some some of you who are more
19:52 - Advan so just kind of bear with me all
19:55 - right so we're going to go style and uh
19:57 - we're going to start with our brackets
19:58 - here here and these curly brackets mean
20:01 - in a react component this means that
20:03 - we're we're going to write some
20:04 - JavaScript we're telling react like hey
20:06 - expect JavaScript now and then inside of
20:09 - that I have more curly brackets so since
20:11 - we're in JavaScript land inside of here
20:14 - this simply means hey this is an object
20:16 - right that's normal you know you put the
20:19 - curly brackets just an object so when
20:22 - you want to write
20:23 - CSS in your component you do it at least
20:27 - in in next you do it like this I'm not
20:30 - sure if it's like this by default for
20:33 - reacts or this is a next thing let me
20:36 - know uh because I haven't done a lot
20:39 - with react when I'm not using next with
20:42 - it as well I've tried some stuff but uh
20:44 - weback just crushed me the first time I
20:47 - tried it so um I didn't really get very
20:50 - far uh so I want to go Min
20:55 - height oops and when you're doing it in
20:58 - here uh you can camel casee it so pretty
21:02 - much all pretty much every C I haven't
21:04 - run into any CSS uh attributes that I
21:08 - couldn't camel case and make it work
21:10 - just in case you don't want a camel case
21:11 - you don't like that I could put this in
21:13 - quotes and just use it like normally but
21:16 - uh I think the camel case is fine uh
21:19 - once you get used to it it's it's all
21:21 - right but I can understand if you're
21:22 - going back and forth between regular CSS
21:24 - and this it could be confusing so you
21:26 - might want to just stick to it now the
21:28 - second property you usually want to put
21:30 - quotes around it uh I'm not sure you may
21:32 - be able to get away with putting the
21:34 - number like just a straight number value
21:36 - uh without quotes but I just always use
21:40 - the quotes no matter what even if I
21:41 - don't have to uh I'm going to give this
21:44 - maybe 500 pixels and just see I kind of
21:48 - feel like we already played with this a
21:49 - little bit and then I just forgot the
21:51 - value that we settled on um
21:54 - but we'll try 500 pixels at first and
21:57 - this will just be in nice um
22:01 - demonstration see so uh not nearly the
22:05 - same type of jarring
22:09 - transition could probably get away with
22:11 - doing a little bit higher but I'm all
22:14 - right with that oh you know what we need
22:15 - to make one more
22:17 - change uh and we made this last time and
22:20 - uh see this is a good example of
22:23 - uh when you make a change like in Dev
22:26 - tools and then you put it off off
22:28 - actually coding it um then you have to
22:31 - do it all over again that's exactly what
22:33 - happened here on a maybe a few days ago
22:36 - we did a video and I made all these
22:38 - changes but I only did them in Dev tools
22:40 - and then I didn't code them so um at
22:43 - least it's I I remember what I had to do
22:46 - uh
22:47 - but this could have been a lot of wasted
22:50 - effort if I didn't go back to this for a
22:52 - couple of weeks and just totally forgot
22:54 - so basically I'm vertically aligning uh
22:57 - whatever is in this container
22:59 - and I'm using my the framework that I'm
23:02 - using for the UI is uh materialized the
23:06 - material design framework and it has
23:09 - this nice class here well these two
23:10 - classes V the V align wrapper and then
23:14 - Vine and then anything in this container
23:18 - is vertically aligned so that's really
23:20 - nice that's cool because it it's based
23:22 - on uh Flex so browsers don't support F
23:25 - Flex it won't work with so um like if
23:27 - you view the site right now in Internet
23:29 - Explorer 11 none of the vertical line
23:31 - Works everything just goes right to the
23:33 - top uh
23:36 - but I'm not super worried about
23:38 - supporting Internet Explorer 11 right
23:40 - now based on the analytics uh that we
23:44 - have for a lot of our other sites we
23:46 - have very few visits from people using
23:49 - Internet Explorer 11 so it's not really
23:52 - worth it's not a good use of my time to
23:54 - optimize anything for Internet Explorer
23:56 - at this point
23:59 - uh so that should fix it so if we go
24:03 - back yep now everything's at the top
24:06 - it'll stay at the top we don't get there
24:09 - we go very nice uh and at least much
24:12 - nicer than before uh I think it was I
24:15 - think Rohan gave the suggestion to
24:17 - animate this and um I I I mentioned
24:20 - before but I think that's an awesome
24:21 - suggestion but like I said I'm I'm
24:24 - that's kind of nitpicky I'm not sure how
24:26 - many people will even you know be UPS
24:28 - about that that transition so uh if I do
24:32 - get time I will definitely put it in uh
24:34 - if not it won't make it although Rohan
24:38 - if you really want to you can submit a
24:40 - pool request uh to to do that
24:44 - um I don't I don't expect you know
24:46 - anybody to take their time to to work on
24:48 - this for me but if you want to then I
24:50 - really appreciate it so the next thing
24:54 - we need to do is figure out how we want
24:57 - this to look
24:59 - right now I have it taking up
25:02 - half but I wanted
25:07 - to my idea was I was going to have a
25:09 - drop down as well so there would be a
25:11 - search and then there'd be a drop down
25:13 - and the drop down would have
25:16 - like basically the equivalent of what
25:18 - tags would be normally like in a blog
25:21 - like in in a WordPress blog you have
25:23 - categories and
25:25 - tags since we have these already and
25:28 - these basically act as like broad
25:35 - categories that's okay I mean that works
25:38 - but I I the people that I'm making the
25:41 - site for had in mind kind of a drop down
25:43 - with some more some categories that were
25:46 - focused on the content so these are the
25:48 - type of content but something that was
25:50 - focused more on the uh the content
25:54 - itself like you know what what the topic
25:57 - is
25:59 - so I don't know that I'm going to add
26:01 - that in right now uh number one reason
26:05 - basically being we have not decided on
26:07 - what the topic should be so I'm not
26:09 - putting in a drop down if there's
26:10 - nothing to go in the drop down and uh I
26:14 - don't really want to go through right
26:15 - now and try to pick out topics that's I
26:18 - don't I don't think that's
26:20 - really it's not really what I should be
26:23 - doing I think someone else more familiar
26:26 - with all of this content could do a
26:28 - better job than I can so I'm going to
26:31 - wait on that I I'll probably let I'll
26:34 - let somebody else know about it and at
26:36 - that point maybe I can add this uh I
26:39 - kind of want to see what this would look
26:40 - like if it was all the way across I
26:42 - think it might look weird on a wider
26:46 - screen I don't know what do you think
26:48 - would it be better to put it all the way
26:50 - across that that'll look fine on a
26:52 - smaller
26:54 - screen maybe uh all right here's my idea
26:57 - right now let let me know what you think
26:59 - on a large screen it's just going to go
27:01 - halfway like this on a small screen it's
27:04 - going to be all the way
27:07 - across also uh is this is this clear
27:11 - enough that you can search here or do
27:13 - you think this needs do I need an icon
27:15 - should I throw in a little search icon
27:17 - in here or are the word search uh plain
27:21 - enough here also I definitely need to
27:23 - change this color this was the
27:26 - default color that I've added uh I have
27:29 - like kind of a little starter theme uh
27:31 - just for styles that I use for all my
27:33 - projects and the this is one of the
27:36 - University's official colors uh but this
27:39 - site doesn't use University colors
27:41 - because it's a like a separate it's part
27:43 - of the University but it's kind of a
27:45 - separate undertaking in some
27:48 - ways so they get to use a different
27:50 - color
27:52 - palette all right I'm going to check the
27:54 - live chat really quick to see what you
27:56 - all think about this before I make any
27:57 - changes
28:09 - okay uh so uh mom mama mama do it's m m-
28:14 - a d oou I'm not sure how to pronounce
28:16 - that please let me know how to pronounce
28:17 - that so I can do it right I don't I
28:18 - don't want to keep mispronouncing it uh
28:21 - if if I am uh clarified the earlier
28:25 - question he says I mean what is he
28:27 - coding for
28:29 - so uh I'm coding for um I work at a
28:32 - university so I'm coding a website for
28:35 - one of the Endeavors of the University
28:38 - it's kind of like a new um Department uh
28:40 - thing that they've started they've
28:42 - they're they have this other company
28:44 - that's creating a learning management
28:46 - system from scratch based on
28:49 - Drupal uh for people to be able to get
28:52 - like certification so they're not going
28:53 - to get a full degree but they can get a
28:56 - certification through this online
28:58 - learning management system that they're
29:00 - building the website that I'm coding is
29:02 - kind of like the marketing informational
29:04 - site that people can go to before
29:07 - they're directed to the actual learning
29:08 - management system and at that point they
29:10 - can sign up for an account and pay for
29:13 - it and do courses and stuff so that's
29:16 - that's what I'm coding right
29:19 - now
29:23 - um Sr says I think you should now start
29:26 - coding you're getting late I age thanks
29:29 - thanks for the reminder if you've
29:31 - watched any of my shows you know I I can
29:33 - talk a little bit uh and not
29:41 - code wahaj says change your Navar on top
29:45 - uh it look it looks really old um you
29:49 - mean like this Navar like this sticky
29:52 - nav that's kind of floating here is that
29:54 - or like the whole one the whole thing
29:57 - here
30:00 - I'm I'm not going to disagree uh with
30:03 - you
30:04 - about certain Design Elements uh this
30:07 - site is a mix of design elements that
30:09 - were in a site that was built previous
30:11 - to this or at least partially built and
30:14 - some design elements that I added so I
30:16 - will say um not all the design decisions
30:20 - on this site were from me I did have to
30:23 - compromise on a lot of things um so but
30:27 - if you have suggestions and I can change
30:29 - them I will change them but I I am not I
30:33 - don't have the freedom to change the
30:34 - design to whatever I want at least not
30:37 - without having more meetings and
30:40 - discussion so but I'm definitely
30:43 - interested in and like uh wah and and
30:47 - maybe you explaining more what you mean
30:49 - and how I could change
30:51 - it
30:54 - um rested ask which framework are you
30:57 - using using for that uh it's materialize
31:01 - is the the uh like CSS JS framework and
31:03 - then I'm using react uh but particular
31:06 - nextjs to like scaffold the react
31:11 - app oh Patrick says isn't there supposed
31:13 - to be a visual representation of what
31:15 - page you're on in the Navar it doesn't
31:16 - seem like it is working um actually no I
31:20 - didn't build that in uh the visual
31:24 - representation it is on my list though
31:27 - or at least I I remember it
31:30 - being maybe right now it's not like that
31:34 - I could make it like that and maybe I
31:37 - should maybe I should put that on the
31:38 - list that would be
31:39 - helpful um so maybe that'll go on the
31:43 - list I don't know if that'll be uh my
31:45 - boss is kind of reviewing my list right
31:47 - now to see like what things actually
31:49 - need to get done and what can kind of
31:51 - just be left left off so I don't know if
31:55 - if that'll make it onto what needs to be
31:56 - done but uh that's probably a good
32:06 - idea uh in regard to the case for the
32:09 - CSS like that I was talking about here
32:11 - when I was putting it in line in react
32:13 - Patrick says uh the react way to do it
32:15 - is camel case
32:16 - Okay
32:18 - um all right Rohan says he he'll do the
32:21 - pool request so awesome thank you and
32:23 - don't don't feel like you have to do it
32:25 - tomorrow if you if you don't get to it
32:27 - that's fine I mean you're you don't have
32:29 - to do it at all if you don't want to uh
32:31 - bill says um I think a search icon would
32:34 - be a good idea oh awesome Bill uh Bill
32:37 - actually sent me a link to the site he's
32:38 - doing with next as well and uh it's
32:40 - awesome I was really impressed with the
32:41 - code um bill I like how you were um like
32:45 - you were making API calls in your
32:47 - server.js file like where I was doing it
32:50 - in the in the component like in the page
32:53 - in the get initial props you're doing it
32:55 - on the server I was really kind of
32:56 - checking that out I'd like to know you
32:58 - don't have to answer me now you could
32:59 - like message me on Twitter but I'd like
33:01 - to know your reasoning behind that um
33:04 - what's the benefit of doing it like that
33:06 - and also how does that work um like
33:10 - let's say if you were going to do a live
33:12 - search thing like this where all these
33:14 - calls to the API are being made like
33:16 - within the component like on the client
33:20 - side how how would that work would would
33:22 - I have is there any way
33:25 - um to do this differently I don't know I
33:27 - just kind of want your thoughts on that
33:29 - cuz I'm I'm really intrigued by it and I
33:31 - like the idea of using the uh the URL to
33:34 - the WordPress back end uh making that
33:36 - environment variable and kind of like
33:38 - hiding it uh I don't really need to hide
33:41 - it for most of my sites but if I ever
33:43 - did I'm going to keep that in
33:44 - mind uh go everybody's saying seems like
33:47 - everybody's saying go for the
33:54 - icon so let's go with the uh icon uh
33:57 - John saying also maybe a box Shadow uh
34:01 - underneath the
34:06 - line okay Rowan's saying sticky nav
34:09 - could be a bit bigger it looks kind of
34:10 - weird
34:15 - okay and let's
34:18 - see Ro robot Villa says the ux guideline
34:22 - text text plus icon enhances usability
34:25 - all right thanks for that you're you're
34:27 - right you are right about that I will
34:28 - add
34:37 - that John says 75% length might would
34:41 - look better all right so let me let me
34:43 - just Su of the suggestions here and
34:44 - let's do it so for sure we we need to
34:47 - add a search icon okay everybody's is on
34:49 - board with that um we've had a
34:52 - suggestion to make this
34:54 - 75% instead of half and then also
34:57 - slightly unrelated suggestion
35:01 - was make the text
35:03 - [Music]
35:05 - in the white background section to be
35:08 - aligned Center all right actually I will
35:12 - say this there there was quite a
35:14 - controversy over how to align these
35:17 - sections so I'm not going to mess with
35:19 - the alignment of this right now just
35:21 - because there there was finally
35:23 - consensus among all the people involved
35:25 - in the project of
35:28 - and and the conclusion ends up being the
35:31 - homepage the first section on the
35:33 - homepage will be Center aligned and on
35:35 - every other page it will be left align
35:37 - and everything will be left
35:38 - align so that's one of those decisions
35:42 - that I'm I'm not going to revisit uh I'm
35:45 - just going to leave it as it is at this
35:46 - point because there is there are so many
35:49 - opinions about it um but I I appreciate
35:53 - the uh saying that all right so let me
35:56 - throw in an icon here I'm I
35:59 - am I'm loading I think I'm loading the
36:03 - material icons but
36:05 - um I I'd rather use an inline SVG icon I
36:09 - like using those better and then that
36:11 - way I can just not load the rest of the
36:13 - material design icons and use just the
36:15 - ones I want so I'm going to do it like
36:19 - that and I think I use this in a project
36:26 - recently trying to remember what project
36:28 - it is so I can just grab the code it'll
36:30 - probably be faster for me to just get it
36:31 - so uh let's go to
36:35 - material Z icons uh what I'm going to do
36:39 - is I'm actually just going to grab the
36:40 - the code from the SVG so like the SVG
36:43 - tag and I'm going to stick it right in
36:44 - there if anybody knows of a reason why
36:46 - that's not a good idea let me know I've
36:48 - been doing it on a lot of sites lately I
36:50 - haven't had any issues with um like
36:52 - browsers not being able to display that
36:55 - uh but if there is some issue that I
36:57 - just haven't figured out yet and you
36:59 - know about it please let me
37:00 - know uh the alternative would be loading
37:03 - like font a font icon set and uh just
37:07 - load using the font
37:09 - icon
37:11 - uh so usually I just go here to material
37:14 - icons I select
37:18 - SVG and it downloads it looks like I've
37:21 - already downloaded this but I'll do it
37:23 - again because it's just going to be
37:25 - faster and then I open it
37:29 - I would rather it not open in the
37:31 - browser because then I don't have to
37:33 - view the source but this gives me a nice
37:36 - SVG I know that's super small it'll get
37:38 - bigger when I I paste it in uh so that
37:41 - gives me a nice
37:42 - SVG tag and I can put it in here so I
37:48 - can put it directly in here in the label
37:50 - and we'll see it in a second it'll need
37:51 - some extra styling but um at least you
37:55 - see actually it's probably not is it
37:57 - going to work I I may have to change
37:59 - some of the
38:00 - um fill height vbx
38:05 - with maybe not I'll have to see
38:07 - sometimes you have to change the uh the
38:09 - attributes because they don't work in
38:12 - react uh like as you would normally use
38:15 - them so we'll see if it all right it
38:17 - worked I'm not
38:18 - getting uh I would have gotten like the
38:20 - pink screen with an air if it didn't
38:22 - work so I just could not
38:25 - remember hm
38:28 - obviously I'm going to change the color
38:29 - of this it's going to be more gray but
38:32 - what do you think about the entire
38:33 - search icon going up like that I don't
38:35 - know that I like
38:39 - that I don't even know that I like it
38:41 - right here would it be better on the
38:43 - end I mean this obviously is the easiest
38:46 - way to do
38:49 - it let me know I'm going to um change
38:53 - the length of this while I give you all
38:55 - a chance to weigh in on where you you
38:57 - think this should
39:05 - go in materialized they have this this
39:08 - column classes similar to bootstrap or
39:10 - other Frameworks uh so I'm just going to
39:13 - give this a column class
39:16 - of let's see nine and that'll give me
39:19 - that
39:20 - 75% but I also want to I want to do that
39:24 - on medium screens and on a small screen
39:27 - I want to do 12 so you can see it's
39:29 - pretty easy to handle columns it's just
39:31 - small screen it's a 12 column layout so
39:34 - 12 means full
39:36 - width
39:38 - um and then obviously for 12 columns uh
39:42 - 34s of 12 column 75% is n
39:47 - so we should see there we go okay so now
39:50 - we have that
39:51 - 75% length here let me know what you all
39:54 - think about that uh if that's
39:58 - okay and when we get to it should be 600
40:04 - pixels or
40:05 - less yep then we get it all the way
40:10 - across so not
40:19 - bad actually you know what I want to
40:21 - test and I totally forgot about this
40:23 - right now we're searching on key
40:25 - up but we will that work on mobile let
40:29 - me know if you've dealt with this before
40:31 - uh do key up events even fire on mobile
40:34 - like on that virtual keyboard or
40:37 - not I mean I'll I'll be able to test it
40:39 - and find out so it's it's not a a big
40:42 - deal
40:43 - if uh if you don't know you know uh but
40:46 - if you happen to be on your phone or
40:48 - have your phone on you and and would
40:49 - like to
40:50 - test actually you can't because this
40:52 - isn't live yet so I'm I'll have to wait
40:55 - and test it
40:58 - uh or at least just look it up all right
41:00 - so the uh the delay on the video is
41:02 - probably it's it's probably been enough
41:05 - time that you've heard my question about
41:07 - this so I'm going to check the live
41:21 - chat okay so uh Rohan um says the font
41:26 - icon is usually too big and not worth it
41:28 - for just one icon yeah I agree the why
41:30 - load all those icons if you just need a
41:32 - few of them that's why I'm using these
41:34 - svgs I've also had issues with certain
41:36 - browsers not displaying my font icons
41:39 - especially when I I've used font awesome
41:41 - for icons I don't know if any of you
41:43 - have had the issue the same issue but
41:45 - occasionally I actually had somebody
41:47 - look at one of my sites and uh lift some
41:50 - really nasty messages on the
41:51 - University's Facebook um uh page there
41:56 - was a post that that was linking to the
41:58 - uh particular site I did and was like
42:00 - super uh upset that the font icons
42:02 - wouldn't work and claiming that we
42:04 - didn't know what we were doing
42:07 - um which I don't know maybe I didn't
42:09 - know what I was doing but it had worked
42:11 - on all the other browsers I tested so
42:13 - anyway I've decided to kind of get away
42:15 - from using full font icon sets and just
42:17 - using svgs because I've had more luck
42:20 - with svgs
42:22 - working uh John recommends uh making
42:25 - sure the SVG code is simpli ified and
42:28 - clean um yeah definitely I don't need
42:32 - all that stuff in the SVG so that might
42:35 - be worthwhile to just do on the live
42:37 - stream in case somebody hasn't worked
42:38 - with svgs so
42:41 - um let me see which ones I don't think I
42:45 - need
42:47 - this I'm just going to pull stuff out
42:49 - and see if it breaks uh because
42:54 - that's that makes for uh good education
42:57 - experience
42:58 - right
43:00 - um yep see okay that works so we don't
43:03 - need that this SVG is already actually
43:06 - really small
43:08 - so you know it's not like I'm saving
43:10 - that much but there are some svgs that
43:12 - are huge and have all kind of extra
43:13 - stuff that aren't needed so it's
43:15 - definitely worthwhile to shrink them
43:16 - down so do I need Phil I don't think I
43:20 - need this either let's take that out and
43:23 - see see what happens oops I
43:28 - keep that oh I guess I do need that so
43:32 - all right I'm not sure if I can take
43:34 - like I could take some of these out and
43:36 - just use CSS to put them in but I mean
43:39 - that's I'm I'm using inline CSS anyway
43:42 - so I don't really see the point in
43:45 - taking this out and then just writing
43:47 - style and putting it back in in style so
43:50 - I will change this to be the same color
43:53 - as the text so I might as well do that
43:56 - right now
43:59 - let's see what color I'm using for this
44:03 - text uh the inspect thing just opened on
44:07 - my my other screen so if you're
44:09 - wondering where that's at but all I'm
44:10 - doing really is just grabbing the color
44:12 - actually I
44:14 - don't I don't like how that color is
44:16 - done let me show you what's going
44:18 - on um the color here is uh like a hex
44:23 - value for gray I don't like that I in if
44:27 - you look at the material design
44:29 - documentation they recommend never using
44:32 - just gray for text they recommend using
44:34 - black but um having it be uh slightly
44:39 - transparent uh so I'll show you so
44:42 - instead of that
44:43 - gray like let's just do
44:46 - black right so we've done black and then
44:48 - we'll go in and let's let's set it
44:52 - to actually this will this should do it
44:56 - all right so we'll set it to like I
44:58 - think 57 is one of the values that they
45:01 - recommend so I'm just going to set it to
45:03 - 57 right so now the text is like this
45:06 - the reason that they recommend doing
45:08 - that is that it becomes much more
45:10 - readable so I wish I had a side by side
45:14 - of like both texts I I I don't
45:18 - but um you have to take my word for it
45:21 - right now or at least take Google's word
45:22 - for it right now it it actually is true
45:26 - your text becomes much more
45:28 - readable uh if you use black or or this
45:33 - also on the flip side could work
45:38 - um I guess it just works with black and
45:40 - gray I was trying to think of other
45:42 - colors where this might also be the case
45:43 - but I think it's just black and gray um
45:47 - that the TR black with some transparency
45:50 - is better than just using the hex color
45:52 - for gray so I'm actually going to switch
45:54 - that I thought I had switched that
45:56 - already in uh like my main CSS file and
45:59 - I edited the
46:01 - um the materialized file but I guess I
46:04 - didn't maybe I did it on a different
46:06 - project and just didn't carry it over
46:10 - so let me fix that now I'll show you let
46:12 - me this is within
46:14 - materialize
46:19 - and input field
46:22 - label let's change this I kind of don't
46:24 - want to
46:27 - I kind of don't want to edit the
46:28 - materialized file directly uh because
46:31 - then if I update the version uh it's
46:34 - going to override all my changes so I'm
46:35 - going to add this to uh my own like CSS
46:40 - file
46:42 - and actually let me just let me copy all
46:44 - of this because that'll be easier and I
46:46 - can just take out the stuff that I don't
46:48 - need uh and then just kind of
46:50 - override what's happening here I'm sure
46:53 - there's other places
46:55 - where where this is happening as well so
46:57 - they're also doing it here uh so let me
47:01 - change that right
47:10 - now and my CSS is a bit of a mess right
47:14 - now I've been kind of slowly working to
47:16 - move a lot of it into the components but
47:18 - as you can see I still have a lot here I
47:20 - could probably get rid of some of it
47:22 - because I've already moved it over um
47:24 - but for now
47:27 - I don't know I'm just going to put this
47:29 - at the bottom
47:31 - because I don't want to take a lot of
47:33 - time to think about my
47:36 - structure uh right in the middle of the
47:38 - live
47:39 - stream so I'm just going to copy that or
47:43 - paste
47:45 - it and all we really need is that first
47:50 - part and also if you saw in the uh in
47:55 - Dev tools it was like this for all the
47:58 - labels so I'm going to go ahead and just
48:03 - put use this as
48:06 - well so we may not even use this for
48:09 - anything else on the site but in case we
48:12 - do that
48:14 - works works now
48:17 - so the uh hot module reloading doesn't
48:20 - work with like a separate CSS file so
48:23 - those changes require a manual refresh
48:26 - at least for the way I have everything
48:28 - set up I'm sure you could probably use
48:30 - something like um live reload or
48:33 - something like that I know you you
48:35 - there's a way you can use um like you
48:37 - can use gulp with webpack and have it
48:40 - all work
48:43 - but for this site I did not set it
48:46 - up let me restart
48:49 - my my Dev
48:55 - server so normally in case you you
48:58 - haven't seen this happen to me before it
48:59 - happens frequently normally you
49:01 - shouldn't have to restart your server
49:02 - and I've never had this happen on
49:04 - another site where I've been building
49:05 - with uh react and next for some reason I
49:08 - don't know what I did but uh I've messed
49:11 - something up and it requires me to
49:14 - frequently uh restart so I'm not blaming
49:17 - next for this I'm sure it was something
49:19 - that I did but just so you know that's
49:22 - not normally uh supposed to
49:24 - happen all right I'm going to go back
49:27 - and check the live chat cuz I never did
49:29 - get around to figuring out where we
49:30 - should put this thing also we can't
49:32 - forget to change this
49:37 - color all right
49:41 - so down downloaded uh said the search
49:45 - icon should not move it Rohan says it
49:47 - should be fixed also it' be nice if you
49:49 - moved it to the right put it on the
49:51 - right uh keep search fire text but it
49:54 - should be persistent all right so it
49:56 - looks like
49:57 - it is
49:58 - unanimous it is unanimous that the
50:01 - search icon should be over here and it
50:04 - should not move actually I like that
50:07 - idea and I
50:09 - think if it turns out that the keyup
50:12 - event doesn't register for the virtual
50:15 - keyboard on a mobile device then I'm
50:17 - going to make it so that when you click
50:19 - on this icon it runs a search as
50:24 - well and then that way we'll we'll cover
50:26 - that
50:27 - uh so I think there's there's definitely
50:29 - value in having this at the end that's
50:31 - actually what I've done when I've put in
50:33 - search bars in other sites that I've
50:35 - done I I usually do put it over here so
50:40 - um yeah who's else cronis says looks bad
50:43 - honestly I appreciate your honesty and I
50:47 - agree um TK TR says I think M M6 look
50:51 - better so 50% look
50:53 - better okay thanks for that what I don't
50:56 - know what do you think do you think 50%
50:57 - look better obviously if I do add in the
50:59 - drop down at some point it's going to
51:01 - look better uh to have it you know half
51:04 - and half I'm
51:08 - sure okay robot Villa icon should be a
51:11 - bit bigger and gray yeah okay bigger as
51:13 - well I was definitely going to do the
51:14 - gray um I would make it bigger as
51:18 - well bill says oh I'll follow up in
51:21 - Twitter chat in more detail but my main
51:22 - issue had been when get initial props
51:24 - fires from client side I was getting
51:26 - mixed content errors uh no SSO on
51:28 - WordPress site oh okay all right so bill
51:30 - was responding to my earlier question
51:31 - thanks for responding and uh thanks for
51:33 - following up with that uh so yeah I was
51:36 - super interested in that so I I'll talk
51:38 - talk to you more about that on
51:41 - Twitter um wahaj agrees with uh robot
51:48 - Villa oh okay bill says he uh he left
51:51 - the uh like the API logic out of the
51:54 - actual like components and it kept to
51:56 - keep the front end cleaner and more
51:58 - reusable I actually I like that
52:07 - idea okay Patrick has linked something
52:10 - on stack over overflow about the input
52:13 - so let's check that out really quickly
52:15 - I'm assuming this is about the um like
52:18 - the mobile uh the key up thing so let's
52:21 - check this out because if if we can get
52:23 - an answer for this right now then
52:29 - uh then we can
52:31 - actually fix it make sure it works on
52:34 - mobile the way we need it
52:41 - to so I've searched it on my on my other
52:44 - screen you all I'm sure know how stack
52:46 - Overflow works so I don't think I need
52:48 - to to show it
52:52 - um nice okay so
52:58 - basically the answer is now that I'm
53:01 - looking at this I'm pretty sure this is
53:03 - the same stack Overflow article I looked
53:06 - up the last time I built a site like
53:08 - this and I just had totally forgotten so
53:11 - I am going to bring this over just to
53:12 - show you
53:14 - all um we basically we have this uh key
53:17 - up and input okay so the um the key
53:21 - thing is the input um input works both
53:26 - on uh desktop and
53:29 - mobile
53:34 - um also this is another answer it didn't
53:39 - get I'm not sure why this didn't get
53:42 - selected
53:44 - either jQuery
53:47 - method this is actually this is for
53:49 - jQuery but I'm assuming there's probably
53:52 - a react equivalent to
53:55 - this um so we'll have to uh we'll test
53:58 - that
54:01 - out although I wish I had
54:06 - um maybe I can do it uh I'll I'll do
54:09 - like a um a simulator for an iPhone and
54:12 - test it uh usually when I when I'm not
54:15 - building in react and I'm building like
54:17 - a static site I use um I have everything
54:20 - set up with Gulp and it's like is it
54:23 - live reload or browser watch or
54:24 - something and um it actually gives you
54:27 - an IP that you can look at on your phone
54:30 - while you're developing which is really
54:32 - cool but I don't that's not how webpack
54:35 - is set up it probably can do it I just
54:37 - don't know
54:44 - how Okay uh Julio says sorry for the
54:47 - question but I'm interested to know if
54:48 - Jesse is a designer with uh
54:51 - programmation skill or is a programmer
54:53 - with design
54:55 - skills good question I would consider
54:58 - myself to be a programmer with some
55:01 - design skills so if you've watched my
55:05 - videos and disagree feel free to to say
55:07 - something
55:08 - but
55:10 - um I do have a lot of opinions about how
55:13 - designs should look and I'm very
55:15 - concerned about how things should look
55:18 - but I don't in consider myself a
55:20 - designer at all but I will say I where I
55:23 - work there are no web designers that
55:25 - work with me so so I do have to do that
55:27 - job as well my title is front-end
55:30 - developer um but I imagine I probably do
55:33 - a lot more design than a front end
55:35 - developer would would normally have to
55:37 - do uh if they're working you know kind
55:39 - of with a proper team uh where they had
55:42 - a you know somebody doing backends
55:43 - somebody doing design and all that so
55:46 - all right let's get back to this let's
55:48 - let's move this over here and make
55:53 - it the same color uh as our text here so
55:57 - we'll do the color first because that's
55:59 - the easiest
56:01 - thing uh we could just grab this
56:05 - color
56:07 - and let's put
56:09 - it oh
56:12 - yeah
56:15 - resources I wonder if the f I don't know
56:18 - I'm just going to try this but I don't
56:19 - know if it'll work I don't know if you
56:20 - can pass a color in like this into this
56:23 - fill or not but it's worth a shot
56:28 - all right awesome that works good to
56:30 - know and now we're going to move this
56:33 - over so B we're going to have to move
56:34 - the code around uh because everything in
56:38 - inside uh
56:41 - this label is going to move so the
56:44 - easiest way to make that stop moving is
56:46 - just to move it outside of the
56:48 - label uh and now we need to
56:56 - oh I didn't get it
57:04 - all uh where we going to put this so we
57:07 - want it still in the input but outside
57:09 - of the label let's put it here and see
57:11 - how it
57:18 - goes oops I can't normally when I work I
57:22 - have things in like different views I've
57:24 - just done it like this um
57:26 - so it's easier to actually let me let me
57:29 - do this since I keep doing this anyway
57:32 - on accident H shoot I put it
57:34 - down actually that might
57:38 - work yeah that'll probably work right
57:40 - there I'll just have to do some
57:41 - positioning
57:43 - so I haven't done any uh real like CSS
57:47 - work in a while so this will be
57:49 - nice um let
57:52 - me shoot as soon as I made this full
57:54 - screen now I have a reason to uh make it
57:57 - half screen again so let's make it half
58:00 - screen and bring this in because I want
58:02 - you all to be able to see what I'm doing
58:04 - in Dev tools I'll have to make Dev tools
58:07 - a bit bigger so you can
58:10 - see uh
58:13 - so we'll keep this screen pretty small
58:17 - and then so we have a little bit more
58:19 - space
58:21 - here all right
58:24 - so here's our SVG we want to position
58:28 - this here
58:30 - so let's
58:35 - see
58:38 - oops
58:40 - position absolute so I'm going to go
58:42 - position absolute and let's
58:46 - go
58:50 - left uh 8 pixels no I mean sorry right
58:58 - eight
59:00 - pixels 16 let's see how 16 looks and
59:04 - then we need it to come down from the
59:05 - top so let's
59:07 - guess
59:10 - um 10
59:13 - pixels NOP I needed some
59:16 - more down more I also want to make this
59:19 - bigger as well so I should probably uh
59:22 - change the size before I uh settle on
59:25 - this
59:29 - so let's just see what what will happen
59:32 - if um let's go with with
59:37 - oops um I'm just going to do
59:46 - 48 Auto
59:49 - okay so check that out in case you're
59:52 - not really used to doing CSS stuff
59:54 - notice when I put the width nothing
59:55 - happen happened until I set height to
60:02 - Auto
60:04 - um let's
60:10 - see I think that that looks all right
60:15 - there I want it to be I I don't want it
60:18 - to be too small because it needs
60:23 - um I guess I don't know I I still don't
60:26 - know whether I'm going to make it uh
60:27 - like taable for a search so um but in
60:30 - case I do I want it to be big enough so
60:32 - it's reasonable to tap it um
60:36 - but if it's too huge like it's just not
60:39 - going to fit you know we don't really
60:40 - have large font going on right now so
60:44 - need it to fit let me know if you think
60:46 - that's too
60:47 - big
60:50 - and now if you see we do this and it
60:52 - stays still
60:57 - all right so now I'm just going to move
60:59 - this to my other screen so I could see
61:01 - it when I uh put this over on my
61:05 - SVG
61:07 - um I could probably get rid of these so
61:12 - since I've already set uh the width and
61:14 - height with the
61:17 - style okay and I think I'm already at
61:19 - 3:00 so um I don't want to go uh we
61:23 - talked yesterday saying it' be better to
61:25 - keep the the streams to like an hour or
61:27 - less so uh this will probably be the um
61:31 - the last thing I do before I go back to
61:33 - the questions so seems like I didn't get
61:36 - a whole lot done but I did find some
61:38 - things that I I didn't even expect to be
61:40 - doing and changed it so got some some
61:43 - things done but just things I didn't
61:45 - think I would even have to
61:46 - do
61:49 - so I kind of don't want to put this
61:51 - right here so because this is
61:56 - so I said before that I I usually like
61:59 - to put it in line if it's not really a
62:01 - lot but if it's a lot of um attributes
62:05 - that I have to add or uh you know a lot
62:08 - of CSS I don't like to add it in here
62:09 - because it just gets huge so I'm going
62:12 - to go down here I only
62:14 - have
62:16 - input so we should be able to get this
62:18 - if I just go to input field
62:22 - SVG that should be good that's should
62:26 - cover Us in case we put another SVG on
62:27 - the page
62:28 - somewhere and let's go
62:39 - to looks like I never close that out
62:43 - so let's close that out
62:47 - right
62:49 - yeah yeah I never closed that up okay
63:01 - and now I'm going to
63:04 - add input field
63:08 - SVG and let's copy all our Styles over
63:11 - the other good thing about this is uh I
63:13 - can just copy them over exactly as they
63:15 - were because I can write it just plain
63:17 - CSS inside of this uh in case you're not
63:20 - sure what's going on here like let's
63:22 - just take a look we have a style tag
63:24 - we've added this jsx which tells it like
63:27 - hey some this is not a normal style tag
63:29 - something's going to happen in here
63:31 - um and now we
63:34 - have our curly brackets so if you
63:36 - remember from earlier in react you see
63:38 - these curly brackets that means okay
63:40 - we're going to do JavaScript now now it
63:42 - might get confusing for you if you're
63:43 - not familiar with template literals uh
63:46 - because this all doesn't look like
63:47 - JavaScript right it's CSS so what we've
63:49 - done in here is we used a template
63:51 - literal when you see one of these in
63:53 - JavaScript this is a newer type of thing
63:56 - it's es6 or ES
63:58 - 2015 um everything within this template
64:00 - literal basically is considered a
64:03 - string there and there's really easy
64:06 - ways to put Javascript in so if I went
64:09 - like
64:11 - this you can see like hey it's
64:13 - JavaScript so
64:17 - um just to show you like I'm getting a
64:20 - different syntax highlighting um when I
64:22 - do stuff like this so anyway um that
64:25 - would be JavaScript in there and I could
64:27 - put it right in here right in the string
64:29 - I don't have to uh put plus signs or
64:30 - anything so that's what's going on here
64:33 - so it it looks crazy at first but if you
64:34 - think about it it makes sense like we're
64:36 - dropping into JavaScript and we're
64:38 - putting everything basically as a string
64:40 - but since we're using the template
64:42 - literal string we can put you know Spa
64:44 - all the spaces have it on multiple lines
64:46 - and it all just works and then because
64:48 - we have this jsx in the style tag uh
64:51 - behind the scenes uh this is all getting
64:55 - added
64:56 - in uh to these elements so when it
64:59 - actually comes out on the other end I'll
65:02 - save this and and we'll see we'll see
65:04 - what's going on here um let me bring
65:09 - in let me bring in Dev
65:13 - tools right so now this is that same
65:17 - SVG but
65:19 - beforehand let me get rid of this stuff
65:21 - because this is what we typed in Dev
65:22 - tools so we don't you know we're getting
65:24 - rid of all that
65:26 - um and we can see like now we have this
65:29 - data
65:31 - djsx and we just have this this long
65:34 - number okay so it's giving this uh its
65:36 - own unique unique number and then on
65:40 - this side here we can see we have input
65:43 - field and then this data jsx number
65:49 - right for our input field which is here
65:53 - and then it's saying you know any svgs
65:55 - within the that input
65:56 - field that have this
65:59 - number get all this so you can see it's
66:02 - very specific when it does that it's
66:04 - definitely not going to mix it up and
66:06 - put something else in there I mean look
66:07 - how many digits are in this number like
66:09 - that's going to cover all your elements
66:10 - for sure
66:13 - um and uh that's how it works
66:17 - so pretty uh I don't know I think that's
66:20 - pretty cool that you know it kind of
66:21 - automatically does all that for you and
66:24 - as we can see just just so that you know
66:26 - it's working all right see we have all
66:28 - the styles that we want and uh you
66:31 - already saw that I I took these Styles
66:33 - off so the ones we did in Dev tools so
66:35 - this is working just like we wanted it
66:37 - to
66:39 - work um the only other thing that we
66:41 - wanted to change was the color and so
66:46 - let me let me hover this I no it's not
66:49 - that the input needs to be hovered right
66:52 - or Focus that's what it needs to be
66:54 - Focus okay so focus our Focus color here
67:00 - we need to change
67:02 - these and we need to change we need to
67:05 - change the uh label color as
67:08 - well
67:12 - so I guess I'll just copy this
67:21 - there's there's actually a place if I
67:23 - was using the SAS version of materialize
67:26 - you can download SAS uh materialized as
67:29 - with the SAS version of the files all
67:31 - split out or the CSS version uh since I
67:35 - don't have like a SAS compiler running
67:37 - right now I just went with a straight
67:38 - CSS version but in the SAS version
67:41 - there's actually a variable that can set
67:43 - this color this is the secondary color
67:45 - variable um and then I would only have
67:48 - to change it once and it would work but
67:51 - that's not unfortunately that's not how
67:52 - I had it set up so I will have to change
67:54 - this in a few places
67:59 - and let me do that in
68:03 - my I'm going to actually do this in
68:06 - the CSS
68:11 - because where it's at I thought I had my
68:13 - CSS running I must have closed oh yeah I
68:15 - did there we go uh I'm going to do it in
68:21 - here and let well I guess I got to
68:24 - decide on a color huh
68:28 - let's decide on a color um do we
68:31 - want
68:34 - red I really don't want red that usually
68:36 - signifies like you know hey there's an
68:39 - error what other color we using how
68:42 - about this how about I use the same
68:44 - color I'm using for this uh this icon
68:47 - we'll see how it
68:49 - looks I don't really have the main
68:51 - colors on the site are really just red
68:53 - black and white um and this is the only
68:56 - alternate color that I think I'm using
68:58 - on on the whole site this is this is
69:02 - actually in the University's official
69:03 - color palettes this is the only color
69:05 - the only time we're using University
69:07 - colors on this whole site is for this
69:10 - color uh okay so let's throw this
69:17 - in and sorry I haven't been paying
69:20 - attention to live chat just because I
69:22 - know we're running out of time and I
69:23 - really wanted to at least have a
69:25 - finished task uh for this
69:28 - video um oops oh I I gotta um got to
69:32 - refresh
69:38 - it okay so you can see here's the color
69:41 - I didn't change it for that
69:43 - yet um we can do that
69:53 - now oops where am I at I have my Dev
69:56 - tools open here so I'm trying to get to
69:58 - this
70:01 - section input field
70:05 - focus
70:06 - and uh label
70:11 - Focus there we go all right
70:17 - so I'm going to copy this
70:21 - and all I was doing on the other screen
70:23 - was basically the exact same thing I
70:25 - just did with this I just found this
70:26 - code in Dev tools and copied and pasted
70:31 - it
70:33 - so if we refresh that should be working
70:37 - as
70:40 - well yep and that works
70:44 - so I don't know that I love that color
70:46 - but I'm not sure if I have another color
70:48 - that I'm using now on the page which
70:50 - would be appropriate other than
70:52 - black I don't really want to go with
70:54 - black
70:57 - so there we
71:01 - go I think basically accomplished
71:04 - everything that we wanted to the only
71:05 - thing I might do is is I don't know we
71:08 - had some some mixed opinions about the
71:10 - length of this line so maybe I'll move
71:12 - it back I'll I'll see what I think
71:16 - um yeah but that's it I mean style wise
71:19 - that's that's good to go uh performance-
71:22 - wise there were some oops there's some
71:24 - optimis ations that I um that I wanted
71:27 - to make but um they're not like critical
71:32 - I don't I don't absolutely have to do
71:33 - them before this goes live all right let
71:35 - me check the uh live chat now sorry I've
71:39 - been neglecting it for so
71:42 - long but
71:45 - um let me try to figure out where I left
71:48 - off
71:49 - at I'm sure there's a lot of good
71:52 - suggestions that I was missing along the
71:54 - way
72:07 - oh okay so uh we had a suggestion uh
72:10 - down downloader said you could try to
72:12 - leave the current size of search input
72:14 - so 75% but then centor
72:17 - it I'll think about that
72:29 - oh okay uh Julio asked uh your title is
72:32 - uh didn't hear that sorry I didn't see
72:34 - that um that remark so if you're still
72:37 - watching because that was a little while
72:38 - ago that you said that my title is front
72:41 - end developer so that's officially I'm a
72:43 - front-end developer for University so
72:46 - that's what it says on the plaque
72:48 - outside my
72:52 - door um
72:56 - Rohan says if you're connected to the
72:57 - same network and don't have devices
72:59 - isolated you can just connect to your P
73:01 - local your PC's local IP and the port to
73:04 - view it on
73:05 - mobile oh okay I'll have to try that
73:08 - good to
73:09 - know
73:12 - uh Deon I'm not sure how to pronounce
73:14 - that so sorry if I did it wrong uh it's
73:16 - do d o n y it says Hey Jesse my
73:20 - company uh I'm interning for just put me
73:23 - on to free code k after completing code
73:26 - academy uh and I love programming keep
73:29 - up the good work oh awesome uh thank you
73:31 - for um for the positive feedback there I
73:35 - really appreciate that and um you know
73:37 - uh good luck with with all your uh your
73:40 - endeavors on code academy uh or and and
73:44 - free code Camp so looks like you say you
73:46 - completed code academy so awesome keep
73:49 - up the good work um
73:58 - okay downloaded has offered some uh
74:01 - advice to vertically centering um
74:05 - the the
74:07 - icon I actually I kind of think um I
74:10 - think it looks okay like that I I don't
74:12 - think I'm going to need to vertically
74:13 - Center it after we made it that comment
74:15 - might have came like before I got it all
74:17 - positioned so um I I'm okay with it just
74:21 - being kind of statically just centered
74:23 - here so thank you for the uh for the
74:27 - suggestion though
74:29 - um Rohan suggests 24 pixels I'm assuming
74:32 - that means this icon 24 pixels maybe
74:35 - I'll play with that a little bit later
74:36 - on I'm not going to go back to it now
74:38 - I'm just going to do handle uh these
74:39 - questions but um I I will I I'm like I'm
74:44 - kind of thinking this is just like
74:46 - slightly too big
74:51 - um yeah I don't know I get the feeling
74:54 - like like I said I'm I'm not really a
74:55 - designer so I couldn't explain to you
74:57 - like reasoning behind this but to me
74:59 - like just my my gut says it's just a
75:03 - little too
75:06 - big um Francesca says uh looks
75:11 - good I love that name Franchesca I got a
75:14 - cousin named Franchesca so awesome name
75:17 - um John says does pug work in react I
75:20 - love pug okay yeah I I like pug too I
75:24 - well I worked with pug sometimes back
75:25 - when it used to be called Jade and then
75:27 - they got like threatened to be sued by
75:29 - some other company that evidently has a
75:31 - copyright for the word jade which is
75:32 - crazy because like come on Jade is like
75:36 - should not be a copyrightable word it's
75:39 - it's a legit you
75:40 - know it's like a very common word you
75:43 - know anyway um so they had to change the
75:45 - name to pug uh I don't really know if
75:48 - pug uh Works in react so sorry if
75:51 - anybody else knows uh you know please uh
75:54 - please let John know know um if if pug
75:57 - Works uh with
76:06 - react um bill says uh in in regard to um
76:11 - being able to check out uh Dev site on
76:14 - your mobile phone uh check out enro
76:17 - that's NG K uh to be able to forward
76:21 - your Local Host beyond your network oh
76:23 - you know what
76:25 - I'm like I feel like a really big idiot
76:28 - right now because on a previous live
76:31 - stream I actually demonstrated how to
76:34 - view your Dev site on your
76:36 - phone and I just totally forgot about it
76:39 - so if you can connect like I have um I
76:43 - have the uh um Google like pixel phone
76:47 - so it takes a
76:49 - USBC a chord but I think pretty much any
76:51 - phone now you could get a chord that can
76:54 - connect it to your computer right so you
76:56 - connect it to your computer and you open
76:59 - up Dev tools
77:01 - and let me just bring this over uh just
77:06 - just to show you
77:08 - like um if we go to remote devices I
77:12 - don't have it connected right now cuz
77:14 - the spot where my cord reaches is right
77:16 - where my mic is and I'll have a lot of
77:18 - static like I had a few uh live streams
77:21 - ago uh because of my phone uh so BAS
77:24 - basically if you would plug this in um
77:27 - you would see your device right here and
77:29 - you could do some like debugging right
77:31 - here uh on your device but also you can
77:34 - port
77:35 - forward so I could forward I actually
77:38 - already doing it I already added the
77:39 - port forwarding so uh I plug this in I
77:42 - say Local Host 3000 is now going to be
77:45 - Local Host 880 on my phone I type in
77:47 - Local Host 8080 on my phone while it's
77:49 - plugged in and I can see it
77:52 - so my brain just was like totally not
77:55 - working at that point but thanks for all
77:57 - the other suggestions uh for everybody
77:59 - that suggested in case for some reason
78:01 - this is not going to work for you um or
78:04 - maybe like you have other people that
78:06 - aren't able to actually plug in to your
78:08 - computer but on your network then you
78:10 - know you might want to set it up in some
78:12 - other
78:13 - way um Rohan says a tad smaller and a
78:16 - bit more to the left so it could go a
78:19 - bit more to
78:20 - yeah you're right a bit more to the left
78:23 - yeah
78:26 - you know what I'm actually going to do
78:27 - too is uh I know that I think on some of
78:30 - Google sites they have a similar setup
78:32 - with the search icon here um I'm going
78:35 - to check it out since I am going by
78:37 - material design guidelines uh sometimes
78:39 - I do like to look like okay well how did
78:41 - Google implement this and so I'll check
78:43 - out one of their sites just to give me
78:45 - some visual reference uh for how they
78:47 - interpreted the material design
78:49 - guidelines in their own sites uh so um
78:53 - that's if you like material design you
78:55 - want to use it uh I recommend doing that
78:57 - like check check out Google sites that
78:59 - use material design uh and just just get
79:02 - ideas because the documentation doesn't
79:05 - cover every use case
79:07 - possible sometimes it's it's nice to see
79:11 - how it's been
79:14 - adapted uh John says and SAS 2 uh in the
79:18 - JavaScript St strings and react as far
79:21 - as I know you can't use SX SAS in the
79:24 - JavaScript style string so let me go
79:26 - back to this just to give some reference
79:28 - to what we're talking about um so this
79:32 - in
79:34 - jsx uh you can check out there there's
79:36 - actually this is on GitHub
79:39 - um trying to think where the repo is
79:43 - uh I can't remember what the repo is
79:45 - called but
79:46 - basically um on my other screen I'm just
79:49 - going to look it up real quick
79:52 - uh at this time I don't think there's
79:56 - support for sassin here but I have seen
79:59 - I maybe it was in in a GitHub issue or
80:01 - something I've seen a discussion about
80:04 - enabling something like that inside of
80:06 - here but I don't think it's enabled
80:08 - right now not to say it's not possible
80:11 - but
80:13 - um I just haven't seen it
80:17 - done and here's the GitHub repo for that
80:20 - it's styled
80:22 - jsx so uh it's the same people that do
80:25 - next so zeit is the the company that
80:27 - does next so style look up styled jsx
80:32 - and this will let you know basically
80:34 - what it can and can't
80:36 - do and um like I think maybe there's one
80:40 - of the issues for this did bring up that
80:42 - aspect
80:43 - so um I I would really actually like to
80:46 - use SAS as well
80:49 - um or at least some of the Fe even if
80:51 - they couldn't Implement all of SAS some
80:53 - of the features would be nice Francesca
80:55 - says the search icon is a functional
80:57 - icon element so visibility is key we
81:00 - want to help our users at all times in a
81:03 - way they don't have to think about what
81:05 - they have to do uh don't make me think
81:09 - principal all right good uh good
81:15 - advice uh bill says uh John it's a part
81:18 - of nextjs I believe style jsx is what
81:20 - they talk about in the docs all right so
81:23 - Bill Bill answered it uh before I even
81:25 - did so um John says so so SAS is
81:30 - possible cool thing I don't I don't
81:32 - really know so once again I I don't
81:33 - really know for sure if sass is possible
81:36 - I think it is it's just not been
81:39 - implemented so I'm sure they might be
81:42 - open you know to a pool request to try
81:44 - to implement
81:46 - it all right getting towards the end of
81:49 - the uh of the live chat comments uh so
81:53 - just in case you're still sticking
81:54 - around and you're not really worried
81:55 - about the live chat I'm not going to do
81:57 - any more coding so if you want to take
81:58 - off now um you know feel free thanks for
82:02 - watching
82:04 - um otherwise uh if you have any more
82:07 - questions I'm getting towards the end so
82:09 - get your questions in now um before I I
82:11 - wrap things up and uh or you could
82:14 - direct message me on Twitter or you
82:15 - could put it in the comments to this
82:17 - video if you're watching the recording
82:19 - uh put it in the comments or message me
82:21 - on Twitter or whatever other social
82:23 - media you prefer I've actually had
82:25 - people email me things too so I'm I'm
82:27 - not opposed to that if you find my phone
82:29 - number and call me though I probably
82:31 - won't answer but if you leave a message
82:32 - I'll listen to
82:34 - it uh oh Sebastian's here okay so
82:37 - Sebastian is a regular uh viewer here
82:40 - and also has given me some great uh tips
82:43 - on like sending me error screenshots of
82:46 - Errors he's gotten on my site which has
82:48 - been super
82:50 - helpful
82:52 - um so Sebastian basically you just miss
82:55 - me working on this this search input
82:57 - just styling it so I mean that's all at
82:59 - the beginning I talked a little bit
83:01 - about um adding images into these cards
83:04 - and I I've done that on another Branch
83:06 - but that's pretty much it um probably
83:10 - doing too much talking and not enough
83:11 - coding to be honest with
83:13 - you
83:15 - but uh colonel colonel Zoom or I guess
83:20 - but that's with an X and not a z says
83:22 - I'm having trouble understanding the
83:23 - grid layout and how to place things uh
83:25 - like a line of text uh next to images or
83:30 - uh or other
83:32 - text um if you are using
83:36 - materialize with the columns and rows
83:39 - let me check out the repo okay so you'll
83:41 - be able to see in obviously the
83:43 - materialized documentation might have
83:45 - some explanation but if you want like
83:46 - real world examples check out my repo
83:49 - the link is in the description or pretty
83:52 - much all of all of my projects for the
83:54 - last I don't know year or so been using
83:56 - materialized so they all have examples
83:58 - but just to show you
84:01 - quickly um how this works uh let me show
84:04 - you a section that does put images next
84:07 - to text uh just to give you an
84:12 - idea um courses all right so in courses
84:15 - I do
84:20 - so
84:22 - subsection down to the ball I know have
84:24 - some down the bottom this this is a mess
84:26 - I can't wait to move this all this junk
84:29 - out into WordPress and just pull that in
84:34 - um so here I have basically I have a
84:37 - section all right which you don't really
84:39 - need the section and I have a container
84:41 - and this is the container is basically
84:43 - just for adding like padding on the
84:45 - sides and I've modified this a bit
84:47 - because I didn't I didn't like the
84:49 - normal container padding like how wide
84:51 - it was so I added this class wide
84:53 - container that
84:55 - it makes it a little bit wider um so
84:57 - that's that's my class this is comes
85:00 - with materialize uh and now what we have
85:04 - in here is a row so this is how you you
85:07 - get the columns and everything to work
85:09 - so basically you have a row you usually
85:11 - don't have a row on its own it's usually
85:13 - wrapped in a container or at least a
85:15 - section but uh so you have your row and
85:18 - then within your row you have columns
85:20 - okay so the First Column I have is on
85:23 - small screens it takes up the whole
85:25 - space and on mediumsized screens which
85:27 - is anything over 600 pixels you have it
85:31 - takes up half the space because half of
85:33 - there's only 12 columns half of 12 is
85:35 - six right so um this this is something I
85:41 - added that's uh that's custom it
85:43 - basically just changes the order of the
85:45 - image and the text on a mobile so that I
85:47 - always have the image on the top and the
85:49 - text below um and then on a big screen
85:52 - they're they're stagger so one section
85:55 - has image and text um like text vers
85:58 - image second the other section has image
86:00 - vers text second so you won't have this
86:03 - by default but if you see it and look at
86:05 - my code that that's what it's doing so
86:08 - this is the first section and then this
86:10 - is the second section and if your screen
86:12 - is larger than 600 pixels they will show
86:15 - up one right after the other so the text
86:17 - will show up on the right hand side and
86:19 - on the leftand side will be the image
86:21 - and they'll both take up half the screen
86:24 - uh but then if you have a small screen
86:26 - the text well normally what would happen
86:28 - is whatever you put first would be on
86:30 - top and what you put second would be on
86:32 - the bottom both taking up the full width
86:34 - in this case I have changed the order be
86:37 - like I I just explained because I I
86:39 - wanted consistency when people are
86:41 - scrolling on mobile um that's how the
86:44 - basic work uh in
86:47 - materialize if you wanted to have like
86:49 - this be 75% width and this be 25% I
86:54 - could change this M6 to M9 and change
86:57 - this M6 to
86:58 - M3 and that would give me that and and
87:01 - you know as long as what you have here
87:04 - between these two add up to 12 no more
87:07 - than 12 then you're
87:09 - good um and and they'll be side by side
87:13 - so hopefully that answered your question
87:15 - let me know if it didn't um or you know
87:18 - send me a direct message or something
87:19 - and I could explain it in more depth uh
87:22 - maybe I'll do a video on stuff like this
87:25 - uh since I I use materialize frequently
87:27 - maybe I could do a a little video just
87:30 - on
87:33 - materialize
87:36 - um okay Sebastian says Center it it
87:40 - looks kind of weird like that all right
87:41 - so let me bring this back up since we're
87:43 - talking about this um okay so this sech
87:46 - thing he saying Center it it looks weird
87:48 - like that okay so I'm definitely going
87:49 - to do something with this because have a
87:52 - lot of people
87:53 - saying basically do something with it
87:55 - either Center it or take it back to half
87:57 - or do so something is going to happen
87:59 - with
88:00 - that
88:04 - um Franchesca said thank you I like your
88:06 - name also Jesse
88:11 - thanks
88:12 - um James says uh as a software tester I
88:16 - have to agree the search is a bit large
88:18 - okay awesome yeah I so that will
88:20 - definitely shrink up I'm not going to
88:21 - shrink it up too much but maybe like
88:23 - four pixels somewhere around there um
88:27 - I'll see how how it looks uh Thor hey
88:30 - Thor's here uh Thor says hey hey
88:33 - Thor um actually now that Thor's here uh
88:36 - this reminds me um I have a question for
88:39 - you all so
88:42 - um I have a major project that's coming
88:46 - up so I did mention I had meetings this
88:47 - morning so basically like my work life
88:50 - for the next year is all booked up as
88:53 - far as at Franc at at Franciscan
88:55 - University where I work is concerned so
88:58 - um uh I guess that's good because I'll
89:01 - know what's coming um but I do have a
89:05 - huge project that's on the horizon and
89:08 - uh maybe even not this year that might
89:09 - be next year but what I need to happen
89:12 - at least what I would hope was happen I
89:13 - have a database that
89:16 - is um feeding data to a site that's
89:19 - running a Content management system
89:21 - called
89:22 - ectron okay not my choice to use ectron
89:25 - that's I inherited it when I started
89:27 - working here I want to move the content
89:30 - over to Wordpress since we're already
89:33 - using Wordpress for a lot of our content
89:35 - it would be easy to be able to teach
89:36 - like our student workers to use
89:38 - WordPress and then they could know how
89:40 - to update all the content
89:42 - so the idea is is it possible is there
89:46 - some way and how hard would it be to
89:49 - move the data out of that Actron
89:52 - database and then move it into another
89:54 - database that WordPress is going to use
89:56 - but move it in such a way that it will
89:58 - be in the it will be structured in the
90:02 - normal WordPress way so WordPress will
90:04 - understand it I don't know very much at
90:06 - all about databases so I don't know if
90:09 - what I'm describing even makes sense to
90:11 - do if you have some experience and
90:14 - you're watching this either live right
90:15 - now or later on in recording please let
90:17 - me know uh direct message me or put in
90:19 - the comments or something uh because
90:22 - I've been it will save a lot of time and
90:26 - money if we can do that and uh to be
90:28 - honest with you like I I think I could
90:31 - probably talk the you know my bosses
90:34 - into you know paying someone to do it so
90:38 - if you know how to do that and you're
90:39 - interested you know let me
90:41 - know
90:45 - um also actually I just remembered this
90:48 - from my meeting I had a meeting
90:49 - yesterday morning as well and uh I was
90:51 - given an award for this website that I'm
90:53 - working on right now it's it's a spirit
90:55 - award so uh it's not like a really big
90:58 - deal thing but uh it's cool you get like
91:01 - a $50 award and a piece of paper
91:04 - describing what a good job you did so
91:06 - that was cool it's nice to be recognized
91:09 - uh for doing a good job
91:13 - um was actually my boss nominated me for
91:16 - it so that was pretty
91:18 - cool uh all right back to the uh to the
91:20 - live chat questions I want to get
91:22 - through these yeah oh man man I've
91:24 - already gone an hour and a half I really
91:25 - need to I need to like set alarms and
91:27 - timers to work on getting my live stream
91:30 - times down to something more manageable
91:32 - that's not as intimidating to watch the
91:34 - recordings so uh hopefully uh I don't
91:38 - forget over the weekend and I I remember
91:40 - to really set some set some timers
91:43 - and uh
91:45 - quit you know really force myself to
91:47 - stop at some
91:49 - point uh Rohan says yeah I usually use
91:53 - Chrome console using USB um uh to my
91:57 - expir also USBC type cable Google has
92:00 - some space between end of Icon and end
92:03 - of line oh okay so those are two
92:05 - different different thoughts I ran them
92:06 - together so um he said Google has some
92:10 - space between of Icon and end of line
92:12 - okay that's why what I thought that's
92:14 - why I did it like that uh if you know
92:15 - like there's a little bit of space uh
92:18 - because like I said it's been somewhat
92:20 - recently at least recent enough for me
92:21 - to remember that I did a very similar
92:24 - input to this on a site and I remember
92:26 - looking it up and that Google had some
92:27 - space so that's why I added the space uh
92:30 - so I I'll double check though and maybe
92:33 - get try to make it as close as possible
92:36 - um since I I'd like to stick to material
92:38 - design as much as I can for consistency
92:40 - sake across all of my sites and for the
92:43 - users so that uh you know a lot of
92:45 - people are exposed to material design so
92:47 - if I use those same uh you know design
92:50 - patterns I think there's an increased
92:52 - chance of a user Auto automatically
92:54 - knowing what to do because they're
92:55 - familiar with it uh I I like that idea I
93:00 - think yeah it's cool sometimes to
93:02 - experiment and make an amazing looking
93:03 - site but sometimes when you do that
93:05 - users have no idea like uh if you look
93:08 - at like the top design sites that win
93:09 - the awards they look amazing and they do
93:11 - cool things but a lot of time at least
93:13 - me when I go to them I have no idea how
93:15 - to use them at first uh so that's not
93:17 - what I want for this site you know maybe
93:19 - U just messing around on the side I
93:21 - could do crazy things but that's one of
93:23 - the reasons why I just stick with
93:25 - material design uh and don't really
93:27 - Branch off and I just I modify it when I
93:30 - have to uh you know when there's not
93:33 - some explicit Direction I'm doing some
93:35 - type of component that's not mentioned
93:38 - in the docs
93:40 - but
93:43 - um anyway I don't I don't even know I
93:45 - think I feel like I went off on a
93:46 - tangent there so I'm going to get back
93:48 - to the live chat um Patrick said by the
93:51 - way what I said about sassin next is
93:52 - wrong it looks like they are supporting
93:55 - script jsx type equals text SL SAS but
94:00 - I'm not sure how far the support is come
94:02 - yet all right awesome Patrick good to
94:03 - know uh so a question earlier I think I
94:07 - think John had the question earlier I
94:08 - don't know if he's still in the live
94:10 - chat uh but um yeah it looks like he's
94:14 - still in there uh so it looks like maybe
94:16 - SAS support is on the way or maybe like
94:19 - somewhat supported so uh that's really
94:22 - good to know I might check that out and
94:23 - try to use it because I uh I like to use
94:26 - SAS when I can on on
94:30 - projects
94:37 - um okay someone mentioned the uh the IRC
94:40 - channel in case you you haven't heard uh
94:43 - there's an IRC Channel now like to
94:45 - continue this discussion on live chat
94:47 - later on it's uh like # FCC Jesse and
94:51 - that's running at uh what is it fre so I
94:54 - don't really know very much at all about
94:56 - IRC so I can't really help you get
94:58 - things set up uh I'm just learning with
95:00 - the help of some people like Rohan and
95:02 - Thor here that are in the live chat and
95:05 - uh
95:06 - so um I try to log in as much as I can I
95:09 - keep getting logged out all the time
95:10 - though and not seeing things so I just
95:12 - need to do a little bit more research
95:13 - and figure out how to best use IRC but
95:16 - uh but if I'm in there and you have
95:18 - questions I'll do my best to answer them
95:19 - as well or the other people in there are
95:21 - actually really knowledgeable more iable
95:24 - than me and they can help you as
95:26 - well
95:35 - um John says thanks for the info on SAS
95:38 - Jesse and Patrick you are you're welcome
95:40 - Patrick really did the work and found
95:42 - the right answer so I I appreciate that
95:44 - Patrick Andrew asks uh not is the only
95:48 - way to do server side rendering uh what
95:51 - do you do when having another language
95:53 - on the the back end uh Rohan answered
95:55 - you could do service side rendering in
95:57 - any language uh yeah that's my
95:59 - understanding too is that you you can do
96:01 - I mean if you think about it like a a
96:03 - regular like WordPress site uses PHP and
96:07 - it
96:07 - renders using PHP on the server side
96:11 - right so um the same way with like uh if
96:14 - you're using like NET Framework stuff
96:16 - you know everything it gets rendered
96:17 - there on a server side so that's
96:18 - actually like the traditional way of
96:20 - doing websites the benefit to using node
96:23 - and act uh at least the way I am is uh
96:26 - that I render the first load is rendered
96:29 - server side so it's a nice fast first
96:32 - load it's just like a static HTML page
96:35 - gets sent and search engines can see
96:38 - that so that's the main reason but then
96:40 - after that first load all the additional
96:44 - um routes so when I click on a internal
96:47 - link that is actually uh all done client
96:52 - side so so um you have the best of both
96:56 - word worlds so you have the routing
96:58 - without a page refresh that's super fast
97:01 - on the client side but then you also get
97:03 - the SEO benefits and the quick loading
97:05 - benefits of that so that's why I do it
97:08 - it's I don't maybe it could be done to
97:10 - where you don't have to use node and you
97:12 - could I don't know can you run react
97:14 - with other stuff on the back end um and
97:16 - do it kind of like this I I don't know
97:19 - enough about it to know like if I could
97:20 - run react and render react with PHP I
97:24 - don't really know uh but you can
97:27 - definitely do it with other languages
97:28 - and that seems to be we had some other
97:30 - people uh give the same answer there in
97:32 - the uh in the live
97:36 - chat uh uh Colonel says and I do this
97:39 - within the same row yes you do so he's
97:41 - responding to when I was demonstrating
97:43 - the um uh the column sorry I'm late with
97:46 - that there's there's a delay on the
97:48 - video so it's it's not exactly real time
97:51 - when I can respond to you like what
97:52 - you're seeing
97:54 - uh also I you know I was answering some
97:56 - other questions too so um so if if
98:00 - you're um whatever you are seeing is
98:04 - actually like what I just said like a
98:06 - minute ago so uh that's why I'm it might
98:11 - be a little off as to when I'm
98:12 - explaining things or answering
98:16 - questions uh
98:23 - inside the Matrix says I like that name
98:26 - um says sorry I'm new is WordPress C or
98:30 - org um so word if if you're not familiar
98:34 - with WordPress there's wordpress.com and
98:35 - wordpress.org
98:37 - um one is like you can go there and just
98:41 - get a site up and running and like it's
98:43 - WordPress takes care of all the hosting
98:45 - and everything like that and you just do
98:47 - your blogging and it has limited
98:49 - functionality in terms of what plugins
98:51 - and customizations you can do the other
98:53 - one is um you can download the entire
98:56 - CMS onto your server for free and set it
98:59 - up and run it however you want and
99:00 - customize it however you want I can't
99:02 - remember what it I think the uh
99:05 - selfhosted version is.org and the doc is
99:10 - the version that they host so correct me
99:14 - if I'm wrong with that but that's
99:16 - the and I'm not even sure if that
99:18 - answers your question right way uh
99:20 - inside the Matrix but uh hopefully it
99:24 - does Rowan says I don't know about how
99:26 - both CMS handle databases but it can be
99:29 - done oh okay so this is in response to
99:32 - my question about
99:33 - databases uh and and Thor also had a
99:37 - response earlier and it I I just now
99:39 - realized it was in response to that says
99:41 - if both systems have an API it would
99:42 - probably work okay uh I'll have to have
99:47 - to look into
99:49 - that so let's say one system doesn't
99:52 - have an A like so the WordPress API I
99:55 - already know how to input data with the
99:57 - WordPress API so I didn't even think
99:59 - about that but that's that's doable I
100:00 - don't know if the other database has an
100:03 - API um I was reading the documentation
100:06 - and it said there was some sort of API
100:09 - but after look like comparing the
100:12 - documentation of how it's supposed to be
100:15 - implemented and how this CMS was
100:16 - actually implemented I'm referring to
100:18 - the Extron CMS that I was talking about
100:20 - earlier it seems like there were some
100:22 - things that were recommended in the
100:24 - documentation that weren't implemented
100:27 - and uh I I don't know for sure cuz this
100:29 - was done before I was here a lot of the
100:31 - work was done by an outside con outside
100:33 - company uh and some of the work was done
100:35 - by an employee who's no longer here so
100:38 - I'm really like having to figure things
100:40 - out on my own and just like go through
100:43 - the code and just try to figure out what
100:45 - happened so
100:48 - um would it be possible then and I'm
100:50 - sure it probably is like to build my own
100:53 - API that pulls from that database if if
100:56 - there's not one
100:59 - already maybe that's maybe that is is
101:02 - the the real answer to
101:06 - that all right Thor says um Sebastian
101:10 - says you could get the data from the
101:11 - database and post it WP Thor thinks
101:13 - that's probably not a good idea um Rohan
101:17 - says database level is easy but not a
101:20 - great idea all right thanks for that
101:22 - because I was thinking originally just
101:24 - on the database level but uh I hadn't
101:26 - even considered the API that seems more
101:29 - doable for me because I am familiar with
101:32 - working with
101:33 - apis uh a lot more so than I'm familiar
101:36 - with working straight with the database
101:39 - so this is like really really helpful
101:41 - for
101:43 - me
101:45 - um okay so Thor has clarified uh
101:49 - theom is the hosted instances and the
101:53 - .org is um when you uh host it yourself
101:59 - so I think I had it
102:00 - backwards honestly if you just type in
102:03 - one or the other you'll find out really
102:04 - quickly which one is
102:06 - which
102:09 - um oh okay Rohan said congratulations
102:12 - that's amazing and I'm like wait what's
102:14 - amazing what did I miss and that that
102:15 - must have been when I was talking about
102:17 - getting the uh award it's it's called a
102:19 - spirit award so yeah I mean it's not
102:22 - like this spir it's a pretty common
102:24 - thing a lot of employees uh do get it uh
102:27 - but like I've been here for almost 2
102:29 - years and I've only gotten it once
102:31 - before so um yeah so I mean I was happy
102:35 - I mean any little thing showing
102:37 - appreciation is you know that's awesome
102:39 - when that happens and uh not that my
102:42 - boss didn't already let me know that he
102:44 - appreciated it uh but yeah the the award
102:47 - was nice and the extra 50 bucks is nice
102:50 - I mean it considering all the extra work
102:53 - I put in that uh it's not much compared
102:56 - to that but it's still cool you know it
102:58 - lets me know
103:00 - that you know my bosses
103:02 - care
103:06 - um let's see uh Francesca says CMS to
103:11 - cms.com can migrate Extron to Wordpress
103:15 - wait are you serious Francesca you might
103:17 - be my favorite person of the day uh if
103:20 - that if that can work because
103:23 - I never heard that so I I am definitely
103:26 - going to check that out if there's like
103:28 - a system that already does
103:31 - this
103:33 - then like H you have no idea like
103:37 - literally the main thing stopping me
103:39 - from completely redoing our main
103:41 - University site so it's it's
103:43 - franciscan.edu
103:45 - um right now the site runs on like
103:48 - Actron which is super old and it's
103:50 - really hard to for people to update the
103:52 - content and and um it loads all this
103:55 - stuff all the time and I've been trying
103:57 - to go through it and just like manually
103:59 - edit templates and things to make it
104:02 - faster but it's just like it takes a
104:04 - long time to accomplish like little
104:06 - things so I want to totally redo it and
104:09 - do it like I did this CI site kakal
104:12 - Institute site with react and the back
104:14 - endb WordPress and make it just really
104:16 - fast so the one thing stopping me from
104:19 - doing that was the idea of who is going
104:22 - to move all this content there are well
104:24 - over 3,000 pages to this site there's a
104:27 - ton of content so we were thinking like
104:29 - we're going to have to hire like some
104:31 - student workers and pay them you know
104:33 - you know have them work a ton of hours
104:35 - to do this and I'm not thrilled about
104:37 - the idea of people copying copying and
104:40 - pasting content
104:41 - so uh anyway so thank you very much
104:44 - Franchesca I just went to this site um
104:47 - so here's the site um so this actually
104:51 - looks really cool I'm definitely going
104:52 - to check out this site and uh this is
104:55 - not an official endorsement of the site
104:57 - I haven't even looked at their page yet
104:59 - so just so you
105:01 - know uh I always feel like I need to
105:04 - give a disclaimer when I talk about some
105:06 - paid service like like I'm not making
105:09 - money off of this and I'm not officially
105:11 - endorsing it uh and that's it I I
105:13 - actually don't make money off of
105:14 - anything if anybody ever wants to use an
105:17 - affiliate link from me because like you
105:19 - appreciate what I'm doing and want to
105:20 - help me out then that's cool let me know
105:22 - but
105:24 - otherwise I'm not going to push uh that
105:26 - kind of
105:27 - thing
105:29 - um let's
105:32 - see does someone
105:34 - use typo3
105:37 - typo3 I don't I don't use it I've
105:40 - actually never heard of it so Andrew
105:42 - asked
105:43 - that um John says he he does or John
105:48 - says he's here all right cool because I
105:49 - asked John if he was still here so uh I
105:51 - was I just wanted you to hear um some of
105:53 - the the answers to the stuff you had
105:55 - asked uh Rohan says try IRC Cloud for
105:58 - Android awesome I will do that um I'll
106:02 - uh I'll try to download that app
106:06 - um Rohan says I had a complicated setup
106:09 - previously but now I just moved to using
106:10 - ioc Cloud on Android sweet that would
106:13 - actually be good and then I could get
106:14 - the messages anywhere and I don't have
106:16 - to be at a computer I tried to use um
106:19 - some like command line client and uh I
106:23 - wasn't exactly sure I must not have set
106:25 - it up right because it wasn't working
106:26 - correctly for me uh I didn't really have
106:29 - time to read the documentation
106:31 - thoroughly
106:33 - so um Thor also says uh for Android
106:37 - Atomic is awesome for IR
106:39 - IRC
106:42 - um oh Sebastian says what app do you use
106:45 - for the IRC for Windows Thor says hex
106:48 - chat is good once again I'm not like I I
106:51 - haven't used any of these things so I
106:53 - don't know I'm just reading out the live
106:55 - chat for those of you who are going to
106:57 - be watching this later on so that you
106:59 - can
107:00 - um you can get the benefit of the live
107:03 - chat without actually being here because
107:06 - correct me if I'm wrong but you can't
107:08 - see the live chat on the recorded videos
107:10 - right if I'm wrong about that then I may
107:13 - be wasting my time by reading all these
107:15 - out but uh I'm pretty sure you
107:19 - can't um all right almost to the end
107:22 - here here so probably wrap this up in
107:24 - maybe like Le 5 minutes or
107:28 - less
107:33 - um IR
107:36 - SSI is mentioned here Rohan mentions
107:39 - that uh and that one's for
107:42 - Linux okay inside the Matrix said yes
107:44 - that answered my question awesome I'm
107:46 - glad glad I could uh could help out
107:49 - there um brohan says it's free for with
107:54 - donation so irssi for Linux free with
108:02 - donation and he says it's also available
108:04 - for Mac too he
108:07 - thinks uh Thor says for Linux uh he
108:10 - prefers WeChat that's actually I think
108:13 - WeChat might be the one that I tried to
108:15 - uh download and use I got it all loaded
108:17 - and I started up and everything and then
108:18 - I I kind of hit a wall and and couldn't
108:20 - get it to work um any further than that
108:24 - uh says not they're not available for
108:26 - Windows
108:29 - though four says I guess CMS to CMS is
108:33 - just people doing it but not sure like
108:34 - the people are doing it for you uh James
108:37 - says you are correct okay so that's
108:39 - actually somebody doing it um I'm
108:42 - actually I'm cool with that like I said
108:43 - I I'm it's definitely worthwhile to pay
108:47 - for this to be done because uh otherwise
108:52 - it's going to cost a a lot of money
108:53 - either way I think uh unless unless I
108:56 - level up my skills and figure out how to
108:59 - how to migrate it in a way that's really
109:01 - easy which I'm not opposed to I like
109:03 - learning new things I just am not
109:04 - confident that I can do it uh in in a
109:08 - way that it would
109:10 - be uh efficient and and really work
109:14 - correctly uh I I'd much rather have
109:16 - somebody who has a lot of experience uh
109:18 - do that uh because if something would
109:21 - have happened that content it would be
109:23 - it would be disastrous it's quite a bit
109:25 - of
109:27 - content yeah Sebastian says I don't
109:30 - think it's copy and paste by humans
109:34 - so oh okay Sebastian said it says 15
109:37 - minute migration on average we're
109:39 - talking about the site CMS to cms.com
109:41 - that Franchesca had recommended uh for
109:44 - migrating um databases from one CMS to
109:46 - the other uh it says 15minute migration
109:49 - on average full scale CMS in a matter of
109:52 - 15 minutes yeah actually that makes me
109:54 - think it um there must there's got to be
109:57 - some automated stuff going on somewhere
109:59 - along the way um right I mean I'm sure
110:02 - there are people that are uh it's not
110:05 - like you click a button and entered info
110:07 - and it automatically happens but um
110:11 - anyway I'll have to check that out a
110:13 - little bit more so like I said that's
110:15 - not a project that's actually not one of
110:17 - the projects that I that we had talked
110:20 - about in our meeting earlier today uh um
110:23 - for the upcoming year but it is a
110:25 - project that I think is like within the
110:27 - next two years it it should H I think it
110:30 - should happen um in my opinion the most
110:33 - important project is the main sight
110:35 - project because that gets like by far
110:36 - the most traffic but that's not the
110:38 - opinion of people higher up so not going
110:41 - to probably not going to be able to work
110:42 - on that uh right
110:45 - now um
110:55 - Umberto says I make buttons that you
110:58 - click once in a day's worth of work is
111:01 - done that that is
111:04 - awesome that that is a good uh a good
111:07 - skill all right that's the end of the uh
111:10 - live chat so I'm going to wrap this up
111:12 - because this ended up being nearly a
111:13 - 2hour video despite my
111:16 - intentions um
111:19 - so today's Friday right so yeah today is
111:22 - Friday so uh I will be back on
111:26 - Monday and uh Monday will be the last
111:29 - week before I'm on vacation so the week
111:32 - after I'll be on vacation and uh I don't
111:35 - know if I'll be able to stream or not
111:36 - depends on the internet and on like
111:38 - what's going on
111:40 - um I should probably spend take a little
111:44 - break on vacation uh but we'll see I
111:46 - mean maybe it'll be like really rainy
111:48 - I'm going to the beach so maybe it'll be
111:49 - rainy and I'll be inside and maybe I'll
111:53 - I'll do a stream or something so um all
111:57 - right yeah hey have have a great weekend
112:00 - um everybody's saying bye in the live
112:02 - stream so I really appreciate everyone
112:04 - watching and all the great um questions
112:06 - and the great
112:08 - advice and um uh yeah so I think um
112:13 - we're starting to develop like a nice
112:14 - little Community that's helping each
112:16 - other here and I think that's really
112:17 - awesome um so a lot of a lot of very
112:20 - knowledgeable people are contributing
112:23 - um to make this stream so much better
112:25 - than it could be if it was just me uh
112:27 - and I really appreciate that um hey
112:31 - you're welcome thanks for watching so uh
112:34 - I'm going to um I'm going to wrap this
112:37 - up and I'm going to try to write down
112:39 - all the stuff suggestions that you guys
112:41 - gave so I don't forget it over the
112:44 - weekend and uh yeah so thanks and uh
112:48 - I'll see you on Monday

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody it's Jesse and uh if you saw the description for this video it's very vague because today as you can see I have my todo list up and I just need to get through some of this stuff normally I try to pick out something that I haven't done before or that I think might be interesting and I I do that during my streaming time but there's really not much left on the todo list that I think is really that interesting the link to this Trello board is in the description you can check it out if you see something in one of these three columns that hasn't been done yet that sounds really interesting let me know in the live chat or even in the comments to the video if I if you comment if you're watching the recording and you comment before I'm done with this site then maybe I could do it but for now I've just been working on some of these didn't get to do as much as I had hoped today because I had some meetings this morning and can't I I always don't like when I have a lot of meetings because it just feels like I don't get anything done uh I'm sure the important stuff does get done in meetings but you just can't see it I'm going to check the live chat here before we get into any code hey everybody a lot of people saying hi in the live chat all right Peter says you he usually joins in about an hour after the stream starts but this time he is early so awesome okay uh okay Jaden asks what are you doing now all right so I'll show you what I was just working on um right before this stream started uh so basically I was working on this add adding images to the resource section so we uh I think I streamed some of this before um I mean we've definitely streamed a lot from that section that Resource page we're doing a lot on there so let me show you what I've done and uh I'm on if you're following the the GitHub repo I'm on the branch for uh called resource images uh so so the stuff isn't in the master Branch yet it's not live yet but basically I I just pulled in these images and everything's working like I wanted it to I'll show you how I did this in a second but what I was doing was I was checking the width of the image and if the image width was less than 600 pixels then I not displaying it because at at some point I think when you get down to like here then this image is almost 600 pixels there so I need it to look good um at some point it would be nice to optimize it even further maybe and use some responsive images but that's not really necessary at this point uh at least you know it's more important just to get the images up at this point than to really be nitpicky about the speed um but here's the problem when I scroll down here these images are I mean these don't look like they're 600 pixel images they look all stretched out uh so and especially you know if you zoom in like you can really tell so somebody's looking at this on the small screen like this let me scroll down to here I mean look that's just not that doesn't look good now this is what I was trying to avoid by setting that that limit uh or that minimum width so I'm waiting on some information back from the person who uploads the images so what I'm thinking I'm basically when I go to look at the uh at the data I'm getting from WordPress which I'll show you here what I'm getting um if there is an image it shows up like this so a better featured image and it has it gives me the width of the original image so all of these images are showing that the original image has this a width of at least 600 pixels and then when I go to let me show you the one that that I just showed you that's not really great quality so this link should this will take me to the image the full image that's supposed to be 666 pixels wide okay look that's definitely you know a wide image but that's not quality so what what I think happened maybe is that when I I had sent an email saying you know if you're going to upload pictures make sure they're 600 pixels wide at least or they're not going to show up so what I think happened is um they resized the images so they took the small images and just resized them to 600 pixels and then uploaded them which of course is not it it's going to look like this so I'm waiting for confirmation um back that that is in fact what happened and if that's the case I'll just have to provide clear instructions that we don't want the images resized as soon as I hear back from that one way or the other then I can merge this with uh the master branch and I can make it live I'm not like thrilled how this looks so I don't know maybe I'll take I won't include these images unless I have them all for all of these these I don't know what do you think to me like this this just looks really weird that you know this is very small and these are now huge also I'm not sure about when I go down you know to like this size so this would be more like somebody on their phone I don't even know if I want to have images on this side this is ends up being a really long scroll I mean there's only a few images but if you can imagine like what if most of these had images you'd be scrolling forever I'm thinking of maybe just not doing any images for small screens load times will be much better which is great because if you're on your mobile and you're on your data plan you don't want to load a bunch of images anyway so let me know what you think about that I'm I'm still undecided as of yet so uh your your input would be very much appreciated all right so I'm just going to switch to another branch and work on something else uh until I I hear back so I don't even know if I'll hear back today uh or if it'll be until next week so I would I kind of hoped that I could get this going and get this live today but uh we'll see I definitely don't want it to be live with those images looking uh like that so trying to find my console here so I'm thinking about just switching back I moved this into like the testing area just so that I know it's basically done I'm just waiting on on some info here I was thinking about going back to that search bar uh so we got this working and uh remember there are just a few optimizations that I wanted to make and I didn't do any styling on the search bar at all so it definitely it doesn't look like I want it to look so I was thinking about switching back to this branch and just doing that so if there's any objections to going back and finishing up with this uh search page let me know I know we did spend a while on that before so uh if you're tired of that tell me maybe I can find something else to do I just looks like I got a bunch of stuff in the live stream so I'm going to check the live stream now really quickly just to see if you uh have some feedback for me before we start okay so uh Asar says is Fabian here today to save Jesse and uh yeah in case you haven't seen the past few streams uh Fabian uh and I'm not even sure if I'm pronouncing your name right Fabian so if you hear this uh let me know cuz he's from Paris so maybe it's more like Fabian or something like that I don't really know um he did save me he submitted a pool request and it was just awesome and um his way to deal with the problem I was dealing with was way better than my way and it worked and um and then he actually joined in the next day in the Stream and and basically step byep that like coached me through how to get the search function to work so super helpful uh but I don't know if he's here today he hasn't said anything in the live chat so we'll see hopefully he is here and uh a lot of the stuff I'm going to be doing today isn't like super difficult stuff so I don't think I'll get stuck to the point where I'm just I'm totally lost um uh mamadu says hello what is it about this live I'm not sure I'm not sure what you're asking so um if you can clarify that for me that would be great and I'll I'll try to answer okay Rohan says uh you put images on the left or right side just color the card the color of the image uh Philly says why not make the images only appear when you hover the mouse okay that's possible you should add hyperlinks for the images David says you should hyper links um Rohan thinks it would be too abrupt to add the hover oh vet said made a few fixes for f marcom okay so we got another Pool request I will check that out um I'll check that out after the stream uh let me know what what parts of the site are they fixes for because uh if you could just quickly let me know in the live stream that way I won't try to mess with them right now and uh you know do the work that you've just done but I really appreciate that and I will check that out as soon as I'm done oh John says use flex justify to stretch uh justify content stretch to fill the heights um and then change with media queries I I have I actually was doing something like that before I wasn't using Flex because the the way that I have the cards now in the columns it um it didn't work right basically like I well I should say it it was easier I don't I'm not it's hard for me to describe how I did it but basically I did something very similar to that uh John's suggestion was to you know like fill the Heights and make them the the same height so uh I might go back to that if I I'll see I'll play with some stuff uh like I said but I'm not going to mess with it anymore until I um until I hear back about what's going on with those images all right thanks V yeah I figured you added a description in the pool request V says he had a description I just wanted like just like a very quick what are they about cuz um I I didn't want to like go over the uh the request um during the live stream wow okay awesome v um it seems like he did a lot of stuff I'm definitely going to check that out uh please says uh W wahaj says Please add some black UI where you want to add the black UI Andre asks about the Trello power power up oh yeah the Trello power up is I added it so long ago I don't even remember what it was let's see what I have activated um it's not even why is it not showing up you know what maybe it's not a PowerUp maybe it's um this might be a browser plugin let see B all right it's called burndown for Trello and I think it's actually a browser plugin and not a not a power up in Trello so I'm using the free version it works for me uh full version lets you do cool stuff with charts like burn down charts and things all right so let me get to work uh I'm going to do this there were no objections uh that I saw to working on the search so I'm going to go to that that's probably is the most like technically challenging thing on the list right now uh so maybe that would be more appealing uh to everyone especially uh for those of you who are a little bit more advanced uh it it would be more appealing some of this other stuff is just really basic uh so let me switch to that Branch there we go live search okay so switch to the live search branch and I always get weird I said not always I often get an error when I switch try to switch branches there we go and I just need to manually refresh uh it's something with a hot module reloading uh messes up when I switch so so we got the resources page here's our search bar in case you didn't see when we made this search bar uh basically as soon as we search for anything uh we have um like a live search let me search for something that's legit okay so we have uh you know this actually has I've typed in the first part of this name so it actually shows up there uh and then not only that if I clicked on these it would keep whatever I searched for and then I could sort by these same categories so it keeps all the Sorting I thought I added a in height maybe I just talked about adding a in height and didn't do it I think I did add it to Trello though so um actually that's a good one to start with I can at least get something checked off the list let me see let me see if I added this I guess I didn't I didn't even add it to Trello so I probably just forgot about it completely maybe that was one of the days where I had to leave like immediately or go to a meeting immediately after the stream there was one stream where I really pushed it and I ended the stream at like 259 and I had a meeting at 3 and I had to just run over uh all right so basically I want to add here's what I want to do and this is easy I don't like that when I type something in and there's nothing it just totally shrinks up like this so I'm going to add a Min height I did have I remember some other suggestions about animating this transitions but um for now I'm just going to add a Min height uh because as I mentioned before in an earlier project uh it's getting to the point where I just like I need to be done I think uh people you know higher up than me my bosses and their bosses are thinking like you know why is this project dragging on they haven't said it like that but that's the feeling that I'm getting so uh I need to just finish it up and I don't want to spend like 13 hours a day like I was doing trying to get this finished so I got to just be I got to just use some judgment on what's what's really necessary and what's just kind of more nitpicky uh to do so let me go to the code here where I'm at resources and I am using next also I'm not I'm not watching the live chat like really diligently right now so I'm going to be going back and forth but I'd like to maybe uh complete a task and then go back to the chat and uh just go back and forth like that uh for maybe like an hour or 45 minutes and then I'll I'll go back to the chat and I'll answer questions um let's see actually yeah today uh as I'm looking for this I I'm going to fill you in on some of the um some of the stuff that's been happening here uh since this this show is about just the daytoday job that I'm doing as a frontend developer uh so I like to fill you in on some of the other stuff that happens when I'm not live streaming just to give you a better picture of what my job is like I don't really know if this is my job is a good example what frontend developers jobs are normally like or not I work at a university so um I imagine a lot of universities do need Developers for their sites so in that sense it's maybe like that but probably not like a tech company would have uh I think this is the column the row that we need actually need more than the row I like the section to have a so if you haven't worked with react before this is going to freak you out to put the CSS right here um but I'm going to do it here I could also put it here okay so I have been using this you know style J X tag and I can write the CSS just like regular CSS in here um but if I'm going to do something to just one element I usually just put it in line I there's there's no point in me just doing it down here if it's only applying to one element at least that's that's the way I feel it's easier for me to see immediately what's happening because it's right here I don't have to like look at the class and then go down here and figure fig it out so I'm sure there are other opinions and pros and cons to doing it a different way but that's how I'm going to do it so um I can just type in style and I'm explaining this in case you know there might be some people watching that aren't familiar at all with with react or anything so I'm kind of explaining some things that I know I've explained before might be some basic to some some of you who are more Advan so just kind of bear with me all right so we're going to go style and uh we're going to start with our brackets here here and these curly brackets mean in a react component this means that we're we're going to write some JavaScript we're telling react like hey expect JavaScript now and then inside of that I have more curly brackets so since we're in JavaScript land inside of here this simply means hey this is an object right that's normal you know you put the curly brackets just an object so when you want to write CSS in your component you do it at least in in next you do it like this I'm not sure if it's like this by default for reacts or this is a next thing let me know uh because I haven't done a lot with react when I'm not using next with it as well I've tried some stuff but uh weback just crushed me the first time I tried it so um I didn't really get very far uh so I want to go Min height oops and when you're doing it in here uh you can camel casee it so pretty much all pretty much every C I haven't run into any CSS uh attributes that I couldn't camel case and make it work just in case you don't want a camel case you don't like that I could put this in quotes and just use it like normally but uh I think the camel case is fine uh once you get used to it it's it's all right but I can understand if you're going back and forth between regular CSS and this it could be confusing so you might want to just stick to it now the second property you usually want to put quotes around it uh I'm not sure you may be able to get away with putting the number like just a straight number value uh without quotes but I just always use the quotes no matter what even if I don't have to uh I'm going to give this maybe 500 pixels and just see I kind of feel like we already played with this a little bit and then I just forgot the value that we settled on um but we'll try 500 pixels at first and this will just be in nice um demonstration see so uh not nearly the same type of jarring transition could probably get away with doing a little bit higher but I'm all right with that oh you know what we need to make one more change uh and we made this last time and uh see this is a good example of uh when you make a change like in Dev tools and then you put it off off actually coding it um then you have to do it all over again that's exactly what happened here on a maybe a few days ago we did a video and I made all these changes but I only did them in Dev tools and then I didn't code them so um at least it's I I remember what I had to do uh but this could have been a lot of wasted effort if I didn't go back to this for a couple of weeks and just totally forgot so basically I'm vertically aligning uh whatever is in this container and I'm using my the framework that I'm using for the UI is uh materialized the material design framework and it has this nice class here well these two classes V the V align wrapper and then Vine and then anything in this container is vertically aligned so that's really nice that's cool because it it's based on uh Flex so browsers don't support F Flex it won't work with so um like if you view the site right now in Internet Explorer 11 none of the vertical line Works everything just goes right to the top uh but I'm not super worried about supporting Internet Explorer 11 right now based on the analytics uh that we have for a lot of our other sites we have very few visits from people using Internet Explorer 11 so it's not really worth it's not a good use of my time to optimize anything for Internet Explorer at this point uh so that should fix it so if we go back yep now everything's at the top it'll stay at the top we don't get there we go very nice uh and at least much nicer than before uh I think it was I think Rohan gave the suggestion to animate this and um I I I mentioned before but I think that's an awesome suggestion but like I said I'm I'm that's kind of nitpicky I'm not sure how many people will even you know be UPS about that that transition so uh if I do get time I will definitely put it in uh if not it won't make it although Rohan if you really want to you can submit a pool request uh to to do that um I don't I don't expect you know anybody to take their time to to work on this for me but if you want to then I really appreciate it so the next thing we need to do is figure out how we want this to look right now I have it taking up half but I wanted to my idea was I was going to have a drop down as well so there would be a search and then there'd be a drop down and the drop down would have like basically the equivalent of what tags would be normally like in a blog like in in a WordPress blog you have categories and tags since we have these already and these basically act as like broad categories that's okay I mean that works but I I the people that I'm making the site for had in mind kind of a drop down with some more some categories that were focused on the content so these are the type of content but something that was focused more on the uh the content itself like you know what what the topic is so I don't know that I'm going to add that in right now uh number one reason basically being we have not decided on what the topic should be so I'm not putting in a drop down if there's nothing to go in the drop down and uh I don't really want to go through right now and try to pick out topics that's I don't I don't think that's really it's not really what I should be doing I think someone else more familiar with all of this content could do a better job than I can so I'm going to wait on that I I'll probably let I'll let somebody else know about it and at that point maybe I can add this uh I kind of want to see what this would look like if it was all the way across I think it might look weird on a wider screen I don't know what do you think would it be better to put it all the way across that that'll look fine on a smaller screen maybe uh all right here's my idea right now let let me know what you think on a large screen it's just going to go halfway like this on a small screen it's going to be all the way across also uh is this is this clear enough that you can search here or do you think this needs do I need an icon should I throw in a little search icon in here or are the word search uh plain enough here also I definitely need to change this color this was the default color that I've added uh I have like kind of a little starter theme uh just for styles that I use for all my projects and the this is one of the University's official colors uh but this site doesn't use University colors because it's a like a separate it's part of the University but it's kind of a separate undertaking in some ways so they get to use a different color palette all right I'm going to check the live chat really quick to see what you all think about this before I make any changes okay uh so uh mom mama mama do it's m m a d oou I'm not sure how to pronounce that please let me know how to pronounce that so I can do it right I don't I don't want to keep mispronouncing it uh if if I am uh clarified the earlier question he says I mean what is he coding for so uh I'm coding for um I work at a university so I'm coding a website for one of the Endeavors of the University it's kind of like a new um Department uh thing that they've started they've they're they have this other company that's creating a learning management system from scratch based on Drupal uh for people to be able to get like certification so they're not going to get a full degree but they can get a certification through this online learning management system that they're building the website that I'm coding is kind of like the marketing informational site that people can go to before they're directed to the actual learning management system and at that point they can sign up for an account and pay for it and do courses and stuff so that's that's what I'm coding right now um Sr says I think you should now start coding you're getting late I age thanks thanks for the reminder if you've watched any of my shows you know I I can talk a little bit uh and not code wahaj says change your Navar on top uh it look it looks really old um you mean like this Navar like this sticky nav that's kind of floating here is that or like the whole one the whole thing here I'm I'm not going to disagree uh with you about certain Design Elements uh this site is a mix of design elements that were in a site that was built previous to this or at least partially built and some design elements that I added so I will say um not all the design decisions on this site were from me I did have to compromise on a lot of things um so but if you have suggestions and I can change them I will change them but I I am not I don't have the freedom to change the design to whatever I want at least not without having more meetings and discussion so but I'm definitely interested in and like uh wah and and maybe you explaining more what you mean and how I could change it um rested ask which framework are you using using for that uh it's materialize is the the uh like CSS JS framework and then I'm using react uh but particular nextjs to like scaffold the react app oh Patrick says isn't there supposed to be a visual representation of what page you're on in the Navar it doesn't seem like it is working um actually no I didn't build that in uh the visual representation it is on my list though or at least I I remember it being maybe right now it's not like that I could make it like that and maybe I should maybe I should put that on the list that would be helpful um so maybe that'll go on the list I don't know if that'll be uh my boss is kind of reviewing my list right now to see like what things actually need to get done and what can kind of just be left left off so I don't know if if that'll make it onto what needs to be done but uh that's probably a good idea uh in regard to the case for the CSS like that I was talking about here when I was putting it in line in react Patrick says uh the react way to do it is camel case Okay um all right Rohan says he he'll do the pool request so awesome thank you and don't don't feel like you have to do it tomorrow if you if you don't get to it that's fine I mean you're you don't have to do it at all if you don't want to uh bill says um I think a search icon would be a good idea oh awesome Bill uh Bill actually sent me a link to the site he's doing with next as well and uh it's awesome I was really impressed with the code um bill I like how you were um like you were making API calls in your server.js file like where I was doing it in the in the component like in the page in the get initial props you're doing it on the server I was really kind of checking that out I'd like to know you don't have to answer me now you could like message me on Twitter but I'd like to know your reasoning behind that um what's the benefit of doing it like that and also how does that work um like let's say if you were going to do a live search thing like this where all these calls to the API are being made like within the component like on the client side how how would that work would would I have is there any way um to do this differently I don't know I just kind of want your thoughts on that cuz I'm I'm really intrigued by it and I like the idea of using the uh the URL to the WordPress back end uh making that environment variable and kind of like hiding it uh I don't really need to hide it for most of my sites but if I ever did I'm going to keep that in mind uh go everybody's saying seems like everybody's saying go for the icon so let's go with the uh icon uh John saying also maybe a box Shadow uh underneath the line okay Rowan's saying sticky nav could be a bit bigger it looks kind of weird okay and let's see Ro robot Villa says the ux guideline text text plus icon enhances usability all right thanks for that you're you're right you are right about that I will add that John says 75% length might would look better all right so let me let me just Su of the suggestions here and let's do it so for sure we we need to add a search icon okay everybody's is on board with that um we've had a suggestion to make this 75% instead of half and then also slightly unrelated suggestion was make the text in the white background section to be aligned Center all right actually I will say this there there was quite a controversy over how to align these sections so I'm not going to mess with the alignment of this right now just because there there was finally consensus among all the people involved in the project of and and the conclusion ends up being the homepage the first section on the homepage will be Center aligned and on every other page it will be left align and everything will be left align so that's one of those decisions that I'm I'm not going to revisit uh I'm just going to leave it as it is at this point because there is there are so many opinions about it um but I I appreciate the uh saying that all right so let me throw in an icon here I'm I am I'm loading I think I'm loading the material icons but um I I'd rather use an inline SVG icon I like using those better and then that way I can just not load the rest of the material design icons and use just the ones I want so I'm going to do it like that and I think I use this in a project recently trying to remember what project it is so I can just grab the code it'll probably be faster for me to just get it so uh let's go to material Z icons uh what I'm going to do is I'm actually just going to grab the the code from the SVG so like the SVG tag and I'm going to stick it right in there if anybody knows of a reason why that's not a good idea let me know I've been doing it on a lot of sites lately I haven't had any issues with um like browsers not being able to display that uh but if there is some issue that I just haven't figured out yet and you know about it please let me know uh the alternative would be loading like font a font icon set and uh just load using the font icon uh so usually I just go here to material icons I select SVG and it downloads it looks like I've already downloaded this but I'll do it again because it's just going to be faster and then I open it I would rather it not open in the browser because then I don't have to view the source but this gives me a nice SVG I know that's super small it'll get bigger when I I paste it in uh so that gives me a nice SVG tag and I can put it in here so I can put it directly in here in the label and we'll see it in a second it'll need some extra styling but um at least you see actually it's probably not is it going to work I I may have to change some of the um fill height vbx with maybe not I'll have to see sometimes you have to change the uh the attributes because they don't work in react uh like as you would normally use them so we'll see if it all right it worked I'm not getting uh I would have gotten like the pink screen with an air if it didn't work so I just could not remember hm obviously I'm going to change the color of this it's going to be more gray but what do you think about the entire search icon going up like that I don't know that I like that I don't even know that I like it right here would it be better on the end I mean this obviously is the easiest way to do it let me know I'm going to um change the length of this while I give you all a chance to weigh in on where you you think this should go in materialized they have this this column classes similar to bootstrap or other Frameworks uh so I'm just going to give this a column class of let's see nine and that'll give me that 75% but I also want to I want to do that on medium screens and on a small screen I want to do 12 so you can see it's pretty easy to handle columns it's just small screen it's a 12 column layout so 12 means full width um and then obviously for 12 columns uh 34s of 12 column 75% is n so we should see there we go okay so now we have that 75% length here let me know what you all think about that uh if that's okay and when we get to it should be 600 pixels or less yep then we get it all the way across so not bad actually you know what I want to test and I totally forgot about this right now we're searching on key up but we will that work on mobile let me know if you've dealt with this before uh do key up events even fire on mobile like on that virtual keyboard or not I mean I'll I'll be able to test it and find out so it's it's not a a big deal if uh if you don't know you know uh but if you happen to be on your phone or have your phone on you and and would like to test actually you can't because this isn't live yet so I'm I'll have to wait and test it uh or at least just look it up all right so the uh the delay on the video is probably it's it's probably been enough time that you've heard my question about this so I'm going to check the live chat okay so uh Rohan um says the font icon is usually too big and not worth it for just one icon yeah I agree the why load all those icons if you just need a few of them that's why I'm using these svgs I've also had issues with certain browsers not displaying my font icons especially when I I've used font awesome for icons I don't know if any of you have had the issue the same issue but occasionally I actually had somebody look at one of my sites and uh lift some really nasty messages on the University's Facebook um uh page there was a post that that was linking to the uh particular site I did and was like super uh upset that the font icons wouldn't work and claiming that we didn't know what we were doing um which I don't know maybe I didn't know what I was doing but it had worked on all the other browsers I tested so anyway I've decided to kind of get away from using full font icon sets and just using svgs because I've had more luck with svgs working uh John recommends uh making sure the SVG code is simpli ified and clean um yeah definitely I don't need all that stuff in the SVG so that might be worthwhile to just do on the live stream in case somebody hasn't worked with svgs so um let me see which ones I don't think I need this I'm just going to pull stuff out and see if it breaks uh because that's that makes for uh good education experience right um yep see okay that works so we don't need that this SVG is already actually really small so you know it's not like I'm saving that much but there are some svgs that are huge and have all kind of extra stuff that aren't needed so it's definitely worthwhile to shrink them down so do I need Phil I don't think I need this either let's take that out and see see what happens oops I keep that oh I guess I do need that so all right I'm not sure if I can take like I could take some of these out and just use CSS to put them in but I mean that's I'm I'm using inline CSS anyway so I don't really see the point in taking this out and then just writing style and putting it back in in style so I will change this to be the same color as the text so I might as well do that right now let's see what color I'm using for this text uh the inspect thing just opened on my my other screen so if you're wondering where that's at but all I'm doing really is just grabbing the color actually I don't I don't like how that color is done let me show you what's going on um the color here is uh like a hex value for gray I don't like that I in if you look at the material design documentation they recommend never using just gray for text they recommend using black but um having it be uh slightly transparent uh so I'll show you so instead of that gray like let's just do black right so we've done black and then we'll go in and let's let's set it to actually this will this should do it all right so we'll set it to like I think 57 is one of the values that they recommend so I'm just going to set it to 57 right so now the text is like this the reason that they recommend doing that is that it becomes much more readable so I wish I had a side by side of like both texts I I I don't but um you have to take my word for it right now or at least take Google's word for it right now it it actually is true your text becomes much more readable uh if you use black or or this also on the flip side could work um I guess it just works with black and gray I was trying to think of other colors where this might also be the case but I think it's just black and gray um that the TR black with some transparency is better than just using the hex color for gray so I'm actually going to switch that I thought I had switched that already in uh like my main CSS file and I edited the um the materialized file but I guess I didn't maybe I did it on a different project and just didn't carry it over so let me fix that now I'll show you let me this is within materialize and input field label let's change this I kind of don't want to I kind of don't want to edit the materialized file directly uh because then if I update the version uh it's going to override all my changes so I'm going to add this to uh my own like CSS file and actually let me just let me copy all of this because that'll be easier and I can just take out the stuff that I don't need uh and then just kind of override what's happening here I'm sure there's other places where where this is happening as well so they're also doing it here uh so let me change that right now and my CSS is a bit of a mess right now I've been kind of slowly working to move a lot of it into the components but as you can see I still have a lot here I could probably get rid of some of it because I've already moved it over um but for now I don't know I'm just going to put this at the bottom because I don't want to take a lot of time to think about my structure uh right in the middle of the live stream so I'm just going to copy that or paste it and all we really need is that first part and also if you saw in the uh in Dev tools it was like this for all the labels so I'm going to go ahead and just put use this as well so we may not even use this for anything else on the site but in case we do that works works now so the uh hot module reloading doesn't work with like a separate CSS file so those changes require a manual refresh at least for the way I have everything set up I'm sure you could probably use something like um live reload or something like that I know you you there's a way you can use um like you can use gulp with webpack and have it all work but for this site I did not set it up let me restart my my Dev server so normally in case you you haven't seen this happen to me before it happens frequently normally you shouldn't have to restart your server and I've never had this happen on another site where I've been building with uh react and next for some reason I don't know what I did but uh I've messed something up and it requires me to frequently uh restart so I'm not blaming next for this I'm sure it was something that I did but just so you know that's not normally uh supposed to happen all right I'm going to go back and check the live chat cuz I never did get around to figuring out where we should put this thing also we can't forget to change this color all right so down downloaded uh said the search icon should not move it Rohan says it should be fixed also it' be nice if you moved it to the right put it on the right uh keep search fire text but it should be persistent all right so it looks like it is unanimous it is unanimous that the search icon should be over here and it should not move actually I like that idea and I think if it turns out that the keyup event doesn't register for the virtual keyboard on a mobile device then I'm going to make it so that when you click on this icon it runs a search as well and then that way we'll we'll cover that uh so I think there's there's definitely value in having this at the end that's actually what I've done when I've put in search bars in other sites that I've done I I usually do put it over here so um yeah who's else cronis says looks bad honestly I appreciate your honesty and I agree um TK TR says I think M M6 look better so 50% look better okay thanks for that what I don't know what do you think do you think 50% look better obviously if I do add in the drop down at some point it's going to look better uh to have it you know half and half I'm sure okay robot Villa icon should be a bit bigger and gray yeah okay bigger as well I was definitely going to do the gray um I would make it bigger as well bill says oh I'll follow up in Twitter chat in more detail but my main issue had been when get initial props fires from client side I was getting mixed content errors uh no SSO on WordPress site oh okay all right so bill was responding to my earlier question thanks for responding and uh thanks for following up with that uh so yeah I was super interested in that so I I'll talk talk to you more about that on Twitter um wahaj agrees with uh robot Villa oh okay bill says he uh he left the uh like the API logic out of the actual like components and it kept to keep the front end cleaner and more reusable I actually I like that idea okay Patrick has linked something on stack over overflow about the input so let's check that out really quickly I'm assuming this is about the um like the mobile uh the key up thing so let's check this out because if if we can get an answer for this right now then uh then we can actually fix it make sure it works on mobile the way we need it to so I've searched it on my on my other screen you all I'm sure know how stack Overflow works so I don't think I need to to show it um nice okay so basically the answer is now that I'm looking at this I'm pretty sure this is the same stack Overflow article I looked up the last time I built a site like this and I just had totally forgotten so I am going to bring this over just to show you all um we basically we have this uh key up and input okay so the um the key thing is the input um input works both on uh desktop and mobile um also this is another answer it didn't get I'm not sure why this didn't get selected either jQuery method this is actually this is for jQuery but I'm assuming there's probably a react equivalent to this um so we'll have to uh we'll test that out although I wish I had um maybe I can do it uh I'll I'll do like a um a simulator for an iPhone and test it uh usually when I when I'm not building in react and I'm building like a static site I use um I have everything set up with Gulp and it's like is it live reload or browser watch or something and um it actually gives you an IP that you can look at on your phone while you're developing which is really cool but I don't that's not how webpack is set up it probably can do it I just don't know how Okay uh Julio says sorry for the question but I'm interested to know if Jesse is a designer with uh programmation skill or is a programmer with design skills good question I would consider myself to be a programmer with some design skills so if you've watched my videos and disagree feel free to to say something but um I do have a lot of opinions about how designs should look and I'm very concerned about how things should look but I don't in consider myself a designer at all but I will say I where I work there are no web designers that work with me so so I do have to do that job as well my title is frontend developer um but I imagine I probably do a lot more design than a front end developer would would normally have to do uh if they're working you know kind of with a proper team uh where they had a you know somebody doing backends somebody doing design and all that so all right let's get back to this let's let's move this over here and make it the same color uh as our text here so we'll do the color first because that's the easiest thing uh we could just grab this color and let's put it oh yeah resources I wonder if the f I don't know I'm just going to try this but I don't know if it'll work I don't know if you can pass a color in like this into this fill or not but it's worth a shot all right awesome that works good to know and now we're going to move this over so B we're going to have to move the code around uh because everything in inside uh this label is going to move so the easiest way to make that stop moving is just to move it outside of the label uh and now we need to oh I didn't get it all uh where we going to put this so we want it still in the input but outside of the label let's put it here and see how it goes oops I can't normally when I work I have things in like different views I've just done it like this um so it's easier to actually let me let me do this since I keep doing this anyway on accident H shoot I put it down actually that might work yeah that'll probably work right there I'll just have to do some positioning so I haven't done any uh real like CSS work in a while so this will be nice um let me shoot as soon as I made this full screen now I have a reason to uh make it half screen again so let's make it half screen and bring this in because I want you all to be able to see what I'm doing in Dev tools I'll have to make Dev tools a bit bigger so you can see uh so we'll keep this screen pretty small and then so we have a little bit more space here all right so here's our SVG we want to position this here so let's see oops position absolute so I'm going to go position absolute and let's go left uh 8 pixels no I mean sorry right eight pixels 16 let's see how 16 looks and then we need it to come down from the top so let's guess um 10 pixels NOP I needed some more down more I also want to make this bigger as well so I should probably uh change the size before I uh settle on this so let's just see what what will happen if um let's go with with oops um I'm just going to do 48 Auto okay so check that out in case you're not really used to doing CSS stuff notice when I put the width nothing happen happened until I set height to Auto um let's see I think that that looks all right there I want it to be I I don't want it to be too small because it needs um I guess I don't know I I still don't know whether I'm going to make it uh like taable for a search so um but in case I do I want it to be big enough so it's reasonable to tap it um but if it's too huge like it's just not going to fit you know we don't really have large font going on right now so need it to fit let me know if you think that's too big and now if you see we do this and it stays still all right so now I'm just going to move this to my other screen so I could see it when I uh put this over on my SVG um I could probably get rid of these so since I've already set uh the width and height with the style okay and I think I'm already at 300 so um I don't want to go uh we talked yesterday saying it' be better to keep the the streams to like an hour or less so uh this will probably be the um the last thing I do before I go back to the questions so seems like I didn't get a whole lot done but I did find some things that I I didn't even expect to be doing and changed it so got some some things done but just things I didn't think I would even have to do so I kind of don't want to put this right here so because this is so I said before that I I usually like to put it in line if it's not really a lot but if it's a lot of um attributes that I have to add or uh you know a lot of CSS I don't like to add it in here because it just gets huge so I'm going to go down here I only have input so we should be able to get this if I just go to input field SVG that should be good that's should cover Us in case we put another SVG on the page somewhere and let's go to looks like I never close that out so let's close that out right yeah yeah I never closed that up okay and now I'm going to add input field SVG and let's copy all our Styles over the other good thing about this is uh I can just copy them over exactly as they were because I can write it just plain CSS inside of this uh in case you're not sure what's going on here like let's just take a look we have a style tag we've added this jsx which tells it like hey some this is not a normal style tag something's going to happen in here um and now we have our curly brackets so if you remember from earlier in react you see these curly brackets that means okay we're going to do JavaScript now now it might get confusing for you if you're not familiar with template literals uh because this all doesn't look like JavaScript right it's CSS so what we've done in here is we used a template literal when you see one of these in JavaScript this is a newer type of thing it's es6 or ES 2015 um everything within this template literal basically is considered a string there and there's really easy ways to put Javascript in so if I went like this you can see like hey it's JavaScript so um just to show you like I'm getting a different syntax highlighting um when I do stuff like this so anyway um that would be JavaScript in there and I could put it right in here right in the string I don't have to uh put plus signs or anything so that's what's going on here so it it looks crazy at first but if you think about it it makes sense like we're dropping into JavaScript and we're putting everything basically as a string but since we're using the template literal string we can put you know Spa all the spaces have it on multiple lines and it all just works and then because we have this jsx in the style tag uh behind the scenes uh this is all getting added in uh to these elements so when it actually comes out on the other end I'll save this and and we'll see we'll see what's going on here um let me bring in let me bring in Dev tools right so now this is that same SVG but beforehand let me get rid of this stuff because this is what we typed in Dev tools so we don't you know we're getting rid of all that um and we can see like now we have this data djsx and we just have this this long number okay so it's giving this uh its own unique unique number and then on this side here we can see we have input field and then this data jsx number right for our input field which is here and then it's saying you know any svgs within the that input field that have this number get all this so you can see it's very specific when it does that it's definitely not going to mix it up and put something else in there I mean look how many digits are in this number like that's going to cover all your elements for sure um and uh that's how it works so pretty uh I don't know I think that's pretty cool that you know it kind of automatically does all that for you and as we can see just just so that you know it's working all right see we have all the styles that we want and uh you already saw that I I took these Styles off so the ones we did in Dev tools so this is working just like we wanted it to work um the only other thing that we wanted to change was the color and so let me let me hover this I no it's not that the input needs to be hovered right or Focus that's what it needs to be Focus okay so focus our Focus color here we need to change these and we need to change we need to change the uh label color as well so I guess I'll just copy this there's there's actually a place if I was using the SAS version of materialize you can download SAS uh materialized as with the SAS version of the files all split out or the CSS version uh since I don't have like a SAS compiler running right now I just went with a straight CSS version but in the SAS version there's actually a variable that can set this color this is the secondary color variable um and then I would only have to change it once and it would work but that's not unfortunately that's not how I had it set up so I will have to change this in a few places and let me do that in my I'm going to actually do this in the CSS because where it's at I thought I had my CSS running I must have closed oh yeah I did there we go uh I'm going to do it in here and let well I guess I got to decide on a color huh let's decide on a color um do we want red I really don't want red that usually signifies like you know hey there's an error what other color we using how about this how about I use the same color I'm using for this uh this icon we'll see how it looks I don't really have the main colors on the site are really just red black and white um and this is the only alternate color that I think I'm using on on the whole site this is this is actually in the University's official color palettes this is the only color the only time we're using University colors on this whole site is for this color uh okay so let's throw this in and sorry I haven't been paying attention to live chat just because I know we're running out of time and I really wanted to at least have a finished task uh for this video um oops oh I I gotta um got to refresh it okay so you can see here's the color I didn't change it for that yet um we can do that now oops where am I at I have my Dev tools open here so I'm trying to get to this section input field focus and uh label Focus there we go all right so I'm going to copy this and all I was doing on the other screen was basically the exact same thing I just did with this I just found this code in Dev tools and copied and pasted it so if we refresh that should be working as well yep and that works so I don't know that I love that color but I'm not sure if I have another color that I'm using now on the page which would be appropriate other than black I don't really want to go with black so there we go I think basically accomplished everything that we wanted to the only thing I might do is is I don't know we had some some mixed opinions about the length of this line so maybe I'll move it back I'll I'll see what I think um yeah but that's it I mean style wise that's that's good to go uh performance wise there were some oops there's some optimis ations that I um that I wanted to make but um they're not like critical I don't I don't absolutely have to do them before this goes live all right let me check the uh live chat now sorry I've been neglecting it for so long but um let me try to figure out where I left off at I'm sure there's a lot of good suggestions that I was missing along the way oh okay so uh we had a suggestion uh down downloader said you could try to leave the current size of search input so 75% but then centor it I'll think about that oh okay uh Julio asked uh your title is uh didn't hear that sorry I didn't see that um that remark so if you're still watching because that was a little while ago that you said that my title is front end developer so that's officially I'm a frontend developer for University so that's what it says on the plaque outside my door um Rohan says if you're connected to the same network and don't have devices isolated you can just connect to your P local your PC's local IP and the port to view it on mobile oh okay I'll have to try that good to know uh Deon I'm not sure how to pronounce that so sorry if I did it wrong uh it's do d o n y it says Hey Jesse my company uh I'm interning for just put me on to free code k after completing code academy uh and I love programming keep up the good work oh awesome uh thank you for um for the positive feedback there I really appreciate that and um you know uh good luck with with all your uh your endeavors on code academy uh or and and free code Camp so looks like you say you completed code academy so awesome keep up the good work um okay downloaded has offered some uh advice to vertically centering um the the icon I actually I kind of think um I think it looks okay like that I I don't think I'm going to need to vertically Center it after we made it that comment might have came like before I got it all positioned so um I I'm okay with it just being kind of statically just centered here so thank you for the uh for the suggestion though um Rohan suggests 24 pixels I'm assuming that means this icon 24 pixels maybe I'll play with that a little bit later on I'm not going to go back to it now I'm just going to do handle uh these questions but um I I will I I'm like I'm kind of thinking this is just like slightly too big um yeah I don't know I get the feeling like like I said I'm I'm not really a designer so I couldn't explain to you like reasoning behind this but to me like just my my gut says it's just a little too big um Francesca says uh looks good I love that name Franchesca I got a cousin named Franchesca so awesome name um John says does pug work in react I love pug okay yeah I I like pug too I well I worked with pug sometimes back when it used to be called Jade and then they got like threatened to be sued by some other company that evidently has a copyright for the word jade which is crazy because like come on Jade is like should not be a copyrightable word it's it's a legit you know it's like a very common word you know anyway um so they had to change the name to pug uh I don't really know if pug uh Works in react so sorry if anybody else knows uh you know please uh please let John know know um if if pug Works uh with react um bill says uh in in regard to um being able to check out uh Dev site on your mobile phone uh check out enro that's NG K uh to be able to forward your Local Host beyond your network oh you know what I'm like I feel like a really big idiot right now because on a previous live stream I actually demonstrated how to view your Dev site on your phone and I just totally forgot about it so if you can connect like I have um I have the uh um Google like pixel phone so it takes a USBC a chord but I think pretty much any phone now you could get a chord that can connect it to your computer right so you connect it to your computer and you open up Dev tools and let me just bring this over uh just just to show you like um if we go to remote devices I don't have it connected right now cuz the spot where my cord reaches is right where my mic is and I'll have a lot of static like I had a few uh live streams ago uh because of my phone uh so BAS basically if you would plug this in um you would see your device right here and you could do some like debugging right here uh on your device but also you can port forward so I could forward I actually already doing it I already added the port forwarding so uh I plug this in I say Local Host 3000 is now going to be Local Host 880 on my phone I type in Local Host 8080 on my phone while it's plugged in and I can see it so my brain just was like totally not working at that point but thanks for all the other suggestions uh for everybody that suggested in case for some reason this is not going to work for you um or maybe like you have other people that aren't able to actually plug in to your computer but on your network then you know you might want to set it up in some other way um Rohan says a tad smaller and a bit more to the left so it could go a bit more to yeah you're right a bit more to the left yeah you know what I'm actually going to do too is uh I know that I think on some of Google sites they have a similar setup with the search icon here um I'm going to check it out since I am going by material design guidelines uh sometimes I do like to look like okay well how did Google implement this and so I'll check out one of their sites just to give me some visual reference uh for how they interpreted the material design guidelines in their own sites uh so um that's if you like material design you want to use it uh I recommend doing that like check check out Google sites that use material design uh and just just get ideas because the documentation doesn't cover every use case possible sometimes it's it's nice to see how it's been adapted uh John says and SAS 2 uh in the JavaScript St strings and react as far as I know you can't use SX SAS in the JavaScript style string so let me go back to this just to give some reference to what we're talking about um so this in jsx uh you can check out there there's actually this is on GitHub um trying to think where the repo is uh I can't remember what the repo is called but basically um on my other screen I'm just going to look it up real quick uh at this time I don't think there's support for sassin here but I have seen I maybe it was in in a GitHub issue or something I've seen a discussion about enabling something like that inside of here but I don't think it's enabled right now not to say it's not possible but um I just haven't seen it done and here's the GitHub repo for that it's styled jsx so uh it's the same people that do next so zeit is the the company that does next so style look up styled jsx and this will let you know basically what it can and can't do and um like I think maybe there's one of the issues for this did bring up that aspect so um I I would really actually like to use SAS as well um or at least some of the Fe even if they couldn't Implement all of SAS some of the features would be nice Francesca says the search icon is a functional icon element so visibility is key we want to help our users at all times in a way they don't have to think about what they have to do uh don't make me think principal all right good uh good advice uh bill says uh John it's a part of nextjs I believe style jsx is what they talk about in the docs all right so Bill Bill answered it uh before I even did so um John says so so SAS is possible cool thing I don't I don't really know so once again I I don't really know for sure if sass is possible I think it is it's just not been implemented so I'm sure they might be open you know to a pool request to try to implement it all right getting towards the end of the uh of the live chat comments uh so just in case you're still sticking around and you're not really worried about the live chat I'm not going to do any more coding so if you want to take off now um you know feel free thanks for watching um otherwise uh if you have any more questions I'm getting towards the end so get your questions in now um before I I wrap things up and uh or you could direct message me on Twitter or you could put it in the comments to this video if you're watching the recording uh put it in the comments or message me on Twitter or whatever other social media you prefer I've actually had people email me things too so I'm I'm not opposed to that if you find my phone number and call me though I probably won't answer but if you leave a message I'll listen to it uh oh Sebastian's here okay so Sebastian is a regular uh viewer here and also has given me some great uh tips on like sending me error screenshots of Errors he's gotten on my site which has been super helpful um so Sebastian basically you just miss me working on this this search input just styling it so I mean that's all at the beginning I talked a little bit about um adding images into these cards and I I've done that on another Branch but that's pretty much it um probably doing too much talking and not enough coding to be honest with you but uh colonel colonel Zoom or I guess but that's with an X and not a z says I'm having trouble understanding the grid layout and how to place things uh like a line of text uh next to images or uh or other text um if you are using materialize with the columns and rows let me check out the repo okay so you'll be able to see in obviously the materialized documentation might have some explanation but if you want like real world examples check out my repo the link is in the description or pretty much all of all of my projects for the last I don't know year or so been using materialized so they all have examples but just to show you quickly um how this works uh let me show you a section that does put images next to text uh just to give you an idea um courses all right so in courses I do so subsection down to the ball I know have some down the bottom this this is a mess I can't wait to move this all this junk out into WordPress and just pull that in um so here I have basically I have a section all right which you don't really need the section and I have a container and this is the container is basically just for adding like padding on the sides and I've modified this a bit because I didn't I didn't like the normal container padding like how wide it was so I added this class wide container that it makes it a little bit wider um so that's that's my class this is comes with materialize uh and now what we have in here is a row so this is how you you get the columns and everything to work so basically you have a row you usually don't have a row on its own it's usually wrapped in a container or at least a section but uh so you have your row and then within your row you have columns okay so the First Column I have is on small screens it takes up the whole space and on mediumsized screens which is anything over 600 pixels you have it takes up half the space because half of there's only 12 columns half of 12 is six right so um this this is something I added that's uh that's custom it basically just changes the order of the image and the text on a mobile so that I always have the image on the top and the text below um and then on a big screen they're they're stagger so one section has image and text um like text vers image second the other section has image vers text second so you won't have this by default but if you see it and look at my code that that's what it's doing so this is the first section and then this is the second section and if your screen is larger than 600 pixels they will show up one right after the other so the text will show up on the right hand side and on the leftand side will be the image and they'll both take up half the screen uh but then if you have a small screen the text well normally what would happen is whatever you put first would be on top and what you put second would be on the bottom both taking up the full width in this case I have changed the order be like I I just explained because I I wanted consistency when people are scrolling on mobile um that's how the basic work uh in materialize if you wanted to have like this be 75% width and this be 25% I could change this M6 to M9 and change this M6 to M3 and that would give me that and and you know as long as what you have here between these two add up to 12 no more than 12 then you're good um and and they'll be side by side so hopefully that answered your question let me know if it didn't um or you know send me a direct message or something and I could explain it in more depth uh maybe I'll do a video on stuff like this uh since I I use materialize frequently maybe I could do a a little video just on materialize um okay Sebastian says Center it it looks kind of weird like that all right so let me bring this back up since we're talking about this um okay so this sech thing he saying Center it it looks weird like that okay so I'm definitely going to do something with this because have a lot of people saying basically do something with it either Center it or take it back to half or do so something is going to happen with that um Franchesca said thank you I like your name also Jesse thanks um James says uh as a software tester I have to agree the search is a bit large okay awesome yeah I so that will definitely shrink up I'm not going to shrink it up too much but maybe like four pixels somewhere around there um I'll see how how it looks uh Thor hey Thor's here uh Thor says hey hey Thor um actually now that Thor's here uh this reminds me um I have a question for you all so um I have a major project that's coming up so I did mention I had meetings this morning so basically like my work life for the next year is all booked up as far as at Franc at at Franciscan University where I work is concerned so um uh I guess that's good because I'll know what's coming um but I do have a huge project that's on the horizon and uh maybe even not this year that might be next year but what I need to happen at least what I would hope was happen I have a database that is um feeding data to a site that's running a Content management system called ectron okay not my choice to use ectron that's I inherited it when I started working here I want to move the content over to Wordpress since we're already using Wordpress for a lot of our content it would be easy to be able to teach like our student workers to use WordPress and then they could know how to update all the content so the idea is is it possible is there some way and how hard would it be to move the data out of that Actron database and then move it into another database that WordPress is going to use but move it in such a way that it will be in the it will be structured in the normal WordPress way so WordPress will understand it I don't know very much at all about databases so I don't know if what I'm describing even makes sense to do if you have some experience and you're watching this either live right now or later on in recording please let me know uh direct message me or put in the comments or something uh because I've been it will save a lot of time and money if we can do that and uh to be honest with you like I I think I could probably talk the you know my bosses into you know paying someone to do it so if you know how to do that and you're interested you know let me know um also actually I just remembered this from my meeting I had a meeting yesterday morning as well and uh I was given an award for this website that I'm working on right now it's it's a spirit award so uh it's not like a really big deal thing but uh it's cool you get like a $50 award and a piece of paper describing what a good job you did so that was cool it's nice to be recognized uh for doing a good job um was actually my boss nominated me for it so that was pretty cool uh all right back to the uh to the live chat questions I want to get through these yeah oh man man I've already gone an hour and a half I really need to I need to like set alarms and timers to work on getting my live stream times down to something more manageable that's not as intimidating to watch the recordings so uh hopefully uh I don't forget over the weekend and I I remember to really set some set some timers and uh quit you know really force myself to stop at some point uh Rohan says yeah I usually use Chrome console using USB um uh to my expir also USBC type cable Google has some space between end of Icon and end of line oh okay so those are two different different thoughts I ran them together so um he said Google has some space between of Icon and end of line okay that's why what I thought that's why I did it like that uh if you know like there's a little bit of space uh because like I said it's been somewhat recently at least recent enough for me to remember that I did a very similar input to this on a site and I remember looking it up and that Google had some space so that's why I added the space uh so I I'll double check though and maybe get try to make it as close as possible um since I I'd like to stick to material design as much as I can for consistency sake across all of my sites and for the users so that uh you know a lot of people are exposed to material design so if I use those same uh you know design patterns I think there's an increased chance of a user Auto automatically knowing what to do because they're familiar with it uh I I like that idea I think yeah it's cool sometimes to experiment and make an amazing looking site but sometimes when you do that users have no idea like uh if you look at like the top design sites that win the awards they look amazing and they do cool things but a lot of time at least me when I go to them I have no idea how to use them at first uh so that's not what I want for this site you know maybe U just messing around on the side I could do crazy things but that's one of the reasons why I just stick with material design uh and don't really Branch off and I just I modify it when I have to uh you know when there's not some explicit Direction I'm doing some type of component that's not mentioned in the docs but um anyway I don't I don't even know I think I feel like I went off on a tangent there so I'm going to get back to the live chat um Patrick said by the way what I said about sassin next is wrong it looks like they are supporting script jsx type equals text SL SAS but I'm not sure how far the support is come yet all right awesome Patrick good to know uh so a question earlier I think I think John had the question earlier I don't know if he's still in the live chat uh but um yeah it looks like he's still in there uh so it looks like maybe SAS support is on the way or maybe like somewhat supported so uh that's really good to know I might check that out and try to use it because I uh I like to use SAS when I can on on projects um okay someone mentioned the uh the IRC channel in case you you haven't heard uh there's an IRC Channel now like to continue this discussion on live chat later on it's uh like # FCC Jesse and that's running at uh what is it fre so I don't really know very much at all about IRC so I can't really help you get things set up uh I'm just learning with the help of some people like Rohan and Thor here that are in the live chat and uh so um I try to log in as much as I can I keep getting logged out all the time though and not seeing things so I just need to do a little bit more research and figure out how to best use IRC but uh but if I'm in there and you have questions I'll do my best to answer them as well or the other people in there are actually really knowledgeable more iable than me and they can help you as well um John says thanks for the info on SAS Jesse and Patrick you are you're welcome Patrick really did the work and found the right answer so I I appreciate that Patrick Andrew asks uh not is the only way to do server side rendering uh what do you do when having another language on the the back end uh Rohan answered you could do service side rendering in any language uh yeah that's my understanding too is that you you can do I mean if you think about it like a a regular like WordPress site uses PHP and it renders using PHP on the server side right so um the same way with like uh if you're using like NET Framework stuff you know everything it gets rendered there on a server side so that's actually like the traditional way of doing websites the benefit to using node and act uh at least the way I am is uh that I render the first load is rendered server side so it's a nice fast first load it's just like a static HTML page gets sent and search engines can see that so that's the main reason but then after that first load all the additional um routes so when I click on a internal link that is actually uh all done client side so so um you have the best of both word worlds so you have the routing without a page refresh that's super fast on the client side but then you also get the SEO benefits and the quick loading benefits of that so that's why I do it it's I don't maybe it could be done to where you don't have to use node and you could I don't know can you run react with other stuff on the back end um and do it kind of like this I I don't know enough about it to know like if I could run react and render react with PHP I don't really know uh but you can definitely do it with other languages and that seems to be we had some other people uh give the same answer there in the uh in the live chat uh uh Colonel says and I do this within the same row yes you do so he's responding to when I was demonstrating the um uh the column sorry I'm late with that there's there's a delay on the video so it's it's not exactly real time when I can respond to you like what you're seeing uh also I you know I was answering some other questions too so um so if if you're um whatever you are seeing is actually like what I just said like a minute ago so uh that's why I'm it might be a little off as to when I'm explaining things or answering questions uh inside the Matrix says I like that name um says sorry I'm new is WordPress C or org um so word if if you're not familiar with WordPress there's wordpress.com and wordpress.org um one is like you can go there and just get a site up and running and like it's WordPress takes care of all the hosting and everything like that and you just do your blogging and it has limited functionality in terms of what plugins and customizations you can do the other one is um you can download the entire CMS onto your server for free and set it up and run it however you want and customize it however you want I can't remember what it I think the uh selfhosted version is.org and the doc is the version that they host so correct me if I'm wrong with that but that's the and I'm not even sure if that answers your question right way uh inside the Matrix but uh hopefully it does Rowan says I don't know about how both CMS handle databases but it can be done oh okay so this is in response to my question about databases uh and and Thor also had a response earlier and it I I just now realized it was in response to that says if both systems have an API it would probably work okay uh I'll have to have to look into that so let's say one system doesn't have an A like so the WordPress API I already know how to input data with the WordPress API so I didn't even think about that but that's that's doable I don't know if the other database has an API um I was reading the documentation and it said there was some sort of API but after look like comparing the documentation of how it's supposed to be implemented and how this CMS was actually implemented I'm referring to the Extron CMS that I was talking about earlier it seems like there were some things that were recommended in the documentation that weren't implemented and uh I I don't know for sure cuz this was done before I was here a lot of the work was done by an outside con outside company uh and some of the work was done by an employee who's no longer here so I'm really like having to figure things out on my own and just like go through the code and just try to figure out what happened so um would it be possible then and I'm sure it probably is like to build my own API that pulls from that database if if there's not one already maybe that's maybe that is is the the real answer to that all right Thor says um Sebastian says you could get the data from the database and post it WP Thor thinks that's probably not a good idea um Rohan says database level is easy but not a great idea all right thanks for that because I was thinking originally just on the database level but uh I hadn't even considered the API that seems more doable for me because I am familiar with working with apis uh a lot more so than I'm familiar with working straight with the database so this is like really really helpful for me um okay so Thor has clarified uh theom is the hosted instances and the .org is um when you uh host it yourself so I think I had it backwards honestly if you just type in one or the other you'll find out really quickly which one is which um oh okay Rohan said congratulations that's amazing and I'm like wait what's amazing what did I miss and that that must have been when I was talking about getting the uh award it's it's called a spirit award so yeah I mean it's not like this spir it's a pretty common thing a lot of employees uh do get it uh but like I've been here for almost 2 years and I've only gotten it once before so um yeah so I mean I was happy I mean any little thing showing appreciation is you know that's awesome when that happens and uh not that my boss didn't already let me know that he appreciated it uh but yeah the the award was nice and the extra 50 bucks is nice I mean it considering all the extra work I put in that uh it's not much compared to that but it's still cool you know it lets me know that you know my bosses care um let's see uh Francesca says CMS to cms.com can migrate Extron to Wordpress wait are you serious Francesca you might be my favorite person of the day uh if that if that can work because I never heard that so I I am definitely going to check that out if there's like a system that already does this then like H you have no idea like literally the main thing stopping me from completely redoing our main University site so it's it's franciscan.edu um right now the site runs on like Actron which is super old and it's really hard to for people to update the content and and um it loads all this stuff all the time and I've been trying to go through it and just like manually edit templates and things to make it faster but it's just like it takes a long time to accomplish like little things so I want to totally redo it and do it like I did this CI site kakal Institute site with react and the back endb WordPress and make it just really fast so the one thing stopping me from doing that was the idea of who is going to move all this content there are well over 3,000 pages to this site there's a ton of content so we were thinking like we're going to have to hire like some student workers and pay them you know you know have them work a ton of hours to do this and I'm not thrilled about the idea of people copying copying and pasting content so uh anyway so thank you very much Franchesca I just went to this site um so here's the site um so this actually looks really cool I'm definitely going to check out this site and uh this is not an official endorsement of the site I haven't even looked at their page yet so just so you know uh I always feel like I need to give a disclaimer when I talk about some paid service like like I'm not making money off of this and I'm not officially endorsing it uh and that's it I I actually don't make money off of anything if anybody ever wants to use an affiliate link from me because like you appreciate what I'm doing and want to help me out then that's cool let me know but otherwise I'm not going to push uh that kind of thing um let's see does someone use typo3 typo3 I don't I don't use it I've actually never heard of it so Andrew asked that um John says he he does or John says he's here all right cool because I asked John if he was still here so uh I was I just wanted you to hear um some of the the answers to the stuff you had asked uh Rohan says try IRC Cloud for Android awesome I will do that um I'll uh I'll try to download that app um Rohan says I had a complicated setup previously but now I just moved to using ioc Cloud on Android sweet that would actually be good and then I could get the messages anywhere and I don't have to be at a computer I tried to use um some like command line client and uh I wasn't exactly sure I must not have set it up right because it wasn't working correctly for me uh I didn't really have time to read the documentation thoroughly so um Thor also says uh for Android Atomic is awesome for IR IRC um oh Sebastian says what app do you use for the IRC for Windows Thor says hex chat is good once again I'm not like I I haven't used any of these things so I don't know I'm just reading out the live chat for those of you who are going to be watching this later on so that you can um you can get the benefit of the live chat without actually being here because correct me if I'm wrong but you can't see the live chat on the recorded videos right if I'm wrong about that then I may be wasting my time by reading all these out but uh I'm pretty sure you can't um all right almost to the end here here so probably wrap this up in maybe like Le 5 minutes or less um IR SSI is mentioned here Rohan mentions that uh and that one's for Linux okay inside the Matrix said yes that answered my question awesome I'm glad glad I could uh could help out there um brohan says it's free for with donation so irssi for Linux free with donation and he says it's also available for Mac too he thinks uh Thor says for Linux uh he prefers WeChat that's actually I think WeChat might be the one that I tried to uh download and use I got it all loaded and I started up and everything and then I I kind of hit a wall and and couldn't get it to work um any further than that uh says not they're not available for Windows though four says I guess CMS to CMS is just people doing it but not sure like the people are doing it for you uh James says you are correct okay so that's actually somebody doing it um I'm actually I'm cool with that like I said I I'm it's definitely worthwhile to pay for this to be done because uh otherwise it's going to cost a a lot of money either way I think uh unless unless I level up my skills and figure out how to how to migrate it in a way that's really easy which I'm not opposed to I like learning new things I just am not confident that I can do it uh in in a way that it would be uh efficient and and really work correctly uh I I'd much rather have somebody who has a lot of experience uh do that uh because if something would have happened that content it would be it would be disastrous it's quite a bit of content yeah Sebastian says I don't think it's copy and paste by humans so oh okay Sebastian said it says 15 minute migration on average we're talking about the site CMS to cms.com that Franchesca had recommended uh for migrating um databases from one CMS to the other uh it says 15minute migration on average full scale CMS in a matter of 15 minutes yeah actually that makes me think it um there must there's got to be some automated stuff going on somewhere along the way um right I mean I'm sure there are people that are uh it's not like you click a button and entered info and it automatically happens but um anyway I'll have to check that out a little bit more so like I said that's not a project that's actually not one of the projects that I that we had talked about in our meeting earlier today uh um for the upcoming year but it is a project that I think is like within the next two years it it should H I think it should happen um in my opinion the most important project is the main sight project because that gets like by far the most traffic but that's not the opinion of people higher up so not going to probably not going to be able to work on that uh right now um Umberto says I make buttons that you click once in a day's worth of work is done that that is awesome that that is a good uh a good skill all right that's the end of the uh live chat so I'm going to wrap this up because this ended up being nearly a 2hour video despite my intentions um so today's Friday right so yeah today is Friday so uh I will be back on Monday and uh Monday will be the last week before I'm on vacation so the week after I'll be on vacation and uh I don't know if I'll be able to stream or not depends on the internet and on like what's going on um I should probably spend take a little break on vacation uh but we'll see I mean maybe it'll be like really rainy I'm going to the beach so maybe it'll be rainy and I'll be inside and maybe I'll I'll do a stream or something so um all right yeah hey have have a great weekend um everybody's saying bye in the live stream so I really appreciate everyone watching and all the great um questions and the great advice and um uh yeah so I think um we're starting to develop like a nice little Community that's helping each other here and I think that's really awesome um so a lot of a lot of very knowledgeable people are contributing um to make this stream so much better than it could be if it was just me uh and I really appreciate that um hey you're welcome thanks for watching so uh I'm going to um I'm going to wrap this up and I'm going to try to write down all the stuff suggestions that you guys gave so I don't forget it over the weekend and uh yeah so thanks and uh I'll see you on Monday
