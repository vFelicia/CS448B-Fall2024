00:00 - bootstrap is one of the most popular css
00:02 - frameworks
00:03 - and sas is one of the most popular css
00:06 - preprocessors
00:07 - in this course patrick will teach you
00:09 - how to create a portfolio website
00:11 - using bootstrap 5 and sas hey
00:14 - everyone how you doing thanks for
00:16 - checking out this video my name is
00:17 - patrick from vex accord
00:20 - so in this video we're going to build a
00:21 - multi-purpose layout with bootstrap
00:23 - version 5
00:24 - and sas and the first thing you're going
00:26 - to do is to learn how to set up the sas
00:28 - environment
00:29 - so that can be able to work with sas
00:32 - then you're going to start building the
00:33 - project for a company called patrick's
00:36 - so we're going to start with the navbar
00:37 - which is the topmost part of this
00:39 - layout and then you're going to create a
00:42 - second section called the intro section
00:44 - so here you're going to create a brief
00:46 - introduction about the company
00:48 - and then on the right you're going to
00:49 - create this pop-up so you have this
00:51 - animated play button and once you click
00:53 - then a video will pop up from youtube or
00:55 - any other source that you choose from
00:58 - they're going to create another section
00:59 - called services so we're going to
01:01 - showcase some of the services
01:03 - our fake company is offering from there
01:06 - going to create another section called
01:07 - testimonials so we're going to showcase
01:09 - what our clients are saying about
01:11 - the company and then from there we're
01:13 - going to create another section called
01:15 - frequently asked questions so here we're
01:18 - going to use
01:19 - bootstrap component called accordion
01:22 - so once you click then the question
01:24 - collapses and
01:25 - reveals the answer from there we're
01:28 - going to create another section
01:29 - for latest work so here going to
01:31 - showcase some of the latest work of a
01:33 - company is
01:34 - has created and then we have these
01:37 - filtering buttons
01:38 - for filtering the categories for the
01:41 - portfolio from there we're going to
01:44 - create another section called get
01:46 - started
01:46 - so this one is similar to what you call
01:48 - call to action so we have this form
01:51 - and then finally we have the bottom part
01:52 - of the layout which is the
01:54 - footer then from there going to make
01:57 - sure that our layout is fully responsive
01:59 - across variety of screen devices
02:02 - so before we get started make sure you
02:04 - have some basic knowledge
02:05 - in html and css so stick around and
02:08 - let's get started
02:12 - welcome back in this video we are going
02:14 - to set up the sas environment
02:16 - and this is to make sure that we have
02:18 - the correct environment for working
02:20 - with sas so the first one is to install
02:23 - node.js it's an open source server
02:26 - environment
02:27 - nodejs allows you to run javascript on
02:29 - the server and it's free and it runs on
02:31 - various platforms
02:32 - so if your machine is not yet installed
02:34 - with node.js you can head over to the
02:36 - office website which is nodejs.org
02:38 - so here on the homepage for those who
02:40 - are using windows we have a download
02:42 - recommended for most users and this one
02:44 - is more than enough
02:45 - for this project alternatively you can
02:47 - also download the current one which has
02:48 - the latest features
02:50 - for other platforms like linux and mac
02:52 - you can check on this link that says
02:53 - downloads so here you need to download
02:56 - the one compatible with your platform
02:58 - or operating system and then once you
03:00 - download then you can install it
03:02 - on your machine and once you install
03:04 - then you need to open your terminal
03:06 - and run node minus minus version
03:11 - and this command will enable you to
03:12 - confirm whether your machine is
03:14 - installed with
03:15 - node.js alternatively you can also use
03:18 - node minus v so you can see mine is
03:22 - installed with version 15.50
03:24 - it can be different in your case but
03:26 - make sure you see results like this
03:28 - so if you don't see results then it
03:29 - means your your machine is not yet
03:31 - installed with
03:32 - node.js so once you do that then we are
03:34 - ready to move to the next step
03:36 - and that is to create a file called
03:38 - package.json
03:39 - so this is a file which is going to help
03:41 - us manage all the dependencies or the
03:43 - packages that we're going to use
03:44 - on the entire project so first we need
03:48 - to
03:48 - create a folder which is going to keep
03:50 - our project files
03:52 - so on my desktop
03:56 - i'm going to create that folder so new
04:00 - folder and i'm going to call this folder
04:03 - bootstrap minus
04:07 - v5 for version 5
04:10 - and then i'm going to open that folder
04:13 - and i'm going to open
04:14 - my terminal or terminal inside that
04:16 - project folder
04:17 - so right click open in terminal so i'm
04:20 - using git bash
04:22 - and here you can see now i'm inside my
04:23 - project folder and this is the path to
04:25 - that folder
04:27 - so here i'm going to run a command which
04:28 - is going to initialize the process of
04:30 - creating that file called package.json
04:33 - so that command is npm init for
04:36 - initialize
04:38 - so this one is a step-by-step process of
04:40 - creating that file
04:42 - so hit enter so here you'll see it says
04:45 - this utility will lock you through
04:47 - creating a package.json file
04:49 - it only covers the most common items and
04:51 - tries to guess
04:52 - sensible defaults so the first item here
04:55 - is the package name and you can see it
04:57 - has already assigned the name of that
04:58 - folder
04:59 - which is bootstrap minus v5 that is the
05:01 - name of the folder that you're going to
05:03 - keep all our projects
05:04 - so if you're not comfortable with that
05:05 - name then you can type that name
05:07 - for example let's say you want a name
05:09 - like
05:11 - my project then you can type it there
05:14 - and then hit enter
05:14 - so for me i'm comfortable with that name
05:17 - so that is the name of that
05:18 - package name and then you can also have
05:20 - the option to change the version
05:22 - so i'm comfortable with that description
05:24 - i'm going to write
05:25 - learning bootstrap
05:32 - version 5 with sas
05:37 - the next item entry point test command
05:40 - we're going to put it later
05:42 - git repository later keywords so here
05:45 - you can enter as many keywords as you
05:46 - want separating them with comma
05:48 - or space so i'm going to start with the
05:50 - first keyword which is boost drop
05:53 - space
05:56 - boot strap
05:59 - minus v5 space
06:02 - we have sas space
06:07 - lan bootstrap
06:16 - space and then lan sas so one word
06:22 - so i'm comfortable with those five
06:23 - keywords actually four
06:27 - five sorry and then i'm going to hit
06:29 - enter
06:30 - other that should probably be your name
06:33 - or your company name
06:34 - so i'm going to write my name
06:39 - enter a license and then here the items
06:43 - you need to double check
06:45 - so if you're comfortable then you can
06:46 - hit enter for ok
06:50 - so now we have completed that process
06:52 - and now if you check inside our project
06:53 - folder you'll see we have a file called
06:55 - package.json
06:58 - the next step that i'm going to do is to
07:00 - add or install the packages that you're
07:01 - going to use
07:02 - in our project so we're going to start
07:05 - with the first package which is that sas
07:06 - that's us is a preprocessor it's going
07:08 - to help us compile sas to css
07:11 - and then we're going to install
07:12 - bootstrap of course and then
07:14 - we have font awesome this one is going
07:16 - to help us with the icons
07:18 - and then we have the auto prefixer so
07:19 - the auto prefix is a plugin that saves
07:21 - you the monotony of adding prefixes to
07:23 - your css
07:24 - so let's start with that sas so you can
07:27 - go to this website which is npmjs.org
07:30 - and search for that package
07:31 - alternatively you can also go to github
07:33 - and search for
07:34 - that sas so here on the search bar i'm
07:37 - going to type
07:37 - that hyphen sas
07:40 - and by doing that you'll be able to see
07:42 - the results and we need the result that
07:44 - says a pure device
07:45 - javascript implementation of sas so i'm
07:48 - going to click on that
07:50 - and here you'll see the first thing is
07:52 - this package has been
07:53 - duplicated that means the package has
07:56 - been renamed to sas
07:57 - so earlier it was named as that sas but
08:00 - now it's been renamed to
08:01 - sas so if you scroll down here on the
08:04 - usage there are different ways of
08:05 - installing and using
08:06 - this package depending on your needs and
08:09 - your environment
08:11 - so you can see here you can install it
08:13 - globally using npm install minus gsas
08:15 - which will provide access to the sas
08:17 - executable you can also edit your
08:20 - project by using npm install
08:22 - and because you're using npm then you're
08:23 - going to install it using this command
08:25 - so i'm going to copy that command
08:28 - and then copy and then on the terminal
08:33 - first i'm going to clear
08:37 - and then i'm going to paste
08:41 - enter so by doing that you'll be able to
08:44 - see a new folder on our project folder
08:46 - called node modules which is going to
08:47 - keep all the packages that you're going
08:49 - to install
08:52 - so now as you can see we have that
08:54 - folder and if you look on the terminal
08:56 - you can see it has added 16 packages
08:58 - so let's look again on the node modules
09:01 - that folder
09:02 - you'll see we have
09:05 - that is some folders you can see we have
09:08 - some folders the 16 of them
09:11 - so i'm going to open this project on my
09:13 - vs code
09:16 - and here you'll see we have a new dev
09:19 - dependency
09:20 - on the package.json file so this one is
09:23 - sas version 1.32 0.12
09:27 - so that is the but by the time i was
09:28 - doing this video it can be different by
09:30 - the time you're watching this video
09:32 - so the next package you're going to
09:34 - install
09:36 - so we have bootstrap so you could go to
09:38 - the official documentation which is
09:40 - getbootstrap.com so on the homepage here
09:42 - you'll see
09:44 - currently version five and then if you
09:46 - scroll down here you'll see
09:48 - the command that you're going to use to
09:49 - install bootstrap
09:52 - so down here we have the installation
09:54 - and here you can see we have that
09:55 - command npm install
09:56 - bootstrap so i'm going to copy that
09:58 - command
10:01 - and then on the terminal i'm going to
10:03 - paste
10:06 - and then i'm going to flag it with minus
10:07 - minus save
10:09 - so this one will save it as a dependency
10:13 - so it has added that package now if you
10:15 - look on the text editor you'll see we
10:17 - have
10:18 - a new dependency called bootstrap
10:20 - version 5.
10:23 - so the next package you're going to
10:24 - install is font awesome
10:27 - so you can go to the official website
10:29 - which is fontosam.com
10:31 - and then down here you need to click on
10:33 - start for free so i'm going to click
10:34 - that
10:36 - and then if you scroll down here you'll
10:38 - see we have npm
10:40 - so i'm going to click on npm
10:43 - and then you'll see version 5.153 so
10:46 - this is the version that we're going to
10:48 - use
10:49 - and then using this package we have
10:51 - different ways of using it
10:53 - and here we have the command for
10:54 - installing it so you can see we have npm
10:56 - installed minus miner save
10:58 - and then the name of that package which
11:00 - is font awesome
11:01 - free so i'm going to copy that command
11:05 - and then on my terminal first i'm going
11:07 - to clear
11:10 - and then i'm going to paste
11:14 - enter so you can see it has added that
11:17 - package
11:18 - now if you check on the text editor you
11:20 - can see we have a new
11:21 - dependency called font awesome version
11:26 - 5.153
11:30 - the next package that i'm going to
11:31 - install is auto prefixer
11:34 - so you can go to npmjs.com and search
11:36 - for that package
11:38 - so on the search bar i'm going to type
11:40 - auto
11:42 - prefixer and i'm going to click on the
11:45 - first results
11:46 - that says pass css and add vendor
11:49 - prefixes to css rules using values from
11:51 - can i use website so i'm going to click
11:54 - on that
11:56 - and here you'll see we have this
11:57 - autoprefixer
11:59 - post css plugin to pass css and add
12:02 - vendor prefixes to css rules
12:05 - so if you scroll down you'll see we have
12:07 - the command for installing
12:08 - this package
12:13 - so i'm just going to to search for that
12:15 - so i'm going to type
12:17 - install
12:20 - so you can see we have that command so
12:21 - i'm going to copy
12:27 - and then on the terminal i'm going to
12:29 - paste
12:31 - then i'm going to flag it with minus
12:32 - minus save
12:36 - enter so it has added
12:39 - the packages nine to one packages so we
12:42 - check from the text editor you see now
12:43 - we have two
12:44 - new dependencies we have the auto prefix
12:47 - version 10
12:48 - 0.25 and we have post cli post css cli
12:52 - version 8.31
12:55 - so with that we can start working on our
12:58 - project
12:58 - and we are going to install other
13:01 - packages
13:01 - as the need arises then from there the
13:04 - next step is to create
13:05 - an npm script which is going to compile
13:07 - our sas to css
13:09 - so on the scripts you can see we have a
13:11 - predefined script so i'm going to remove
13:13 - it and then i'm going to write
13:14 - my own so the first option on the script
13:18 - is the name of that script so we have
13:20 - the double quotes
13:21 - and then the name of that script so i'm
13:23 - going to call it compile
13:26 - colon and then sas and here you have the
13:29 - option to give it
13:30 - any keyword or name that you want to use
13:33 - then from there we have the command
13:35 - again we have the double quotes
13:36 - and you're going to start with sas the
13:38 - name of that
13:40 - package that we installed called the
13:41 - datsus and then space
13:44 - and then the source of your sas files so
13:47 - i'm going to create a folder called
13:48 - scss which is going to keep all the sas
13:51 - files and then you have the column and
13:54 - then the destination
13:55 - of where you want to keep your compile
13:57 - css so here i'm going to
13:59 - tell the script to create two folders
14:01 - the first one is the assets
14:05 - and then the second one is css
14:08 - so it's going to get my sas from the sss
14:11 - folder and then it's going to compile
14:13 - and keep that compile css to this folder
14:15 - called css
14:17 - so from there i'm going to save
14:20 - and then i'm going to create this folder
14:22 - called scss
14:24 - so inside the project
14:28 - i'm going to create that folder which is
14:30 - scss
14:33 - so from there we're going to put our
14:35 - script to test so inside the css folder
14:38 - i'm going to create a new sas file
14:40 - and i'm going to call it style dot
14:43 - scss
14:46 - so on the terminal before we write any
14:49 - style
14:50 - i'm going to start that script
14:54 - so on the terminal i'm going to run npm
14:57 - run compile sas
15:01 - so remember the name of that script if
15:03 - you check again on the package.json file
15:06 - you can see we have that
15:07 - the name of that script which is
15:08 - compiled call on sas
15:11 - so that's the script that you need to
15:12 - run on your terminal that is
15:14 - npm run and then the name of that script
15:17 - which is compile sas
15:18 - it can be any name that you've given so
15:21 - from there i'm going to hit enter
15:24 - and by doing that you'll see it has
15:27 - compiled and then terminated the process
15:28 - and then if you check on the project
15:30 - you'll see we have a new folder called
15:31 - assets
15:33 - and say and then inside that's it we
15:34 - have another folder called css
15:36 - and you can see we have the two files we
15:38 - have style.css and then we have
15:41 - a source map and source maps are files
15:44 - that tell browsers or other tools that
15:46 - consume css
15:47 - how that css corresponds to the sas
15:49 - files from which it was generated
15:52 - so they make it possible to see and even
15:54 - edit your sas files
15:55 - in browsers so that means every sas file
15:59 - that we create inside the sss folder
16:01 - is going to generate a source map inside
16:05 - the folder where we keep all the
16:07 - compiled css
16:09 - so for testing purposes i'm going to
16:11 - write some styles on the sas
16:13 - file which is the style.css
16:16 - and then you're going to see how it's
16:17 - going to compile on the style.css
16:20 - so i'm going to open that file which is
16:22 - style.css to the side
16:23 - so that you can see in real time how
16:25 - it's going to compile
16:27 - so before i write any styles i'm going
16:30 - to run
16:30 - the script again
16:36 - and here you can see it has compiled and
16:39 - then it has terminated the process
16:41 - so we need to keep this script running
16:42 - every time that we do changes
16:44 - to the sas file or to that folder called
16:47 - scss
16:48 - so to make it work we're going to modify
16:50 - the script a bit so inside the package
16:52 - to json file
16:54 - we're going to modify the script again
16:55 - and then we're going to add the watch
16:57 - flag so that
16:58 - it can watch for the changes that you're
16:59 - going to do inside that file
17:01 - or inside that folder called scss
17:05 - so here on the script where we have the
17:06 - sas
17:08 - i'm going to create a space and then i'm
17:11 - going to add that
17:12 - flag which is minus minus watch
17:15 - so that flag is going to watch for the
17:17 - changes that you're going to do
17:19 - inside that folder or any for any file
17:21 - inside that folder called
17:23 - sss so i'm going to save
17:26 - and then i'm going to run the script
17:30 - again
17:32 - so now you can see the script has not
17:33 - terminated the process you can see
17:35 - sas is watching for changes you can
17:37 - press ctrl c
17:38 - to stop the script so you can see now
17:41 - it's watching for the changes that
17:43 - you're going to do inside that
17:44 - file so let's do some styles
17:47 - on that sas file and then you're going
17:49 - to see how it's going to compile in
17:51 - real time so here i'm going to create a
17:53 - variable called primary
17:56 - and then i'm going to assign the value
17:58 - or a hex value that is
18:00 - a red color so we have ff and the four
18:02 - zeros
18:05 - and then i'm going to assign it so we
18:08 - have
18:08 - a class called test one
18:12 - i'm going to assign it a color
18:16 - and then i'm going to assign it that
18:18 - primary color
18:21 - so immediately i save you'll see it's
18:23 - going to compile
18:24 - or watch for the changes and then
18:26 - compile it to our style sheet
18:29 - so i'm going to save and as you can see
18:32 - it has compiled and assigned that color
18:35 - so if we check now on the terminal
18:37 - you'll see
18:38 - it has already compiled and it's still
18:40 - watching for the changes
18:42 - that you're going to do so let's change
18:45 - let's change the color
18:48 - let's change to another color
18:54 - so i'm going to assign it
18:58 - a yellow color so we have ff0 and then
19:00 - i'm going to save
19:02 - and as you can see it has already
19:03 - compiled and that means
19:06 - it is watching for the changes that
19:07 - you're going to do inside that
19:09 - file so that means our script is working
19:13 - perfectly fine so and just like i said
19:16 - this one
19:17 - was just for testing purposes so i'm
19:19 - going to remove it
19:20 - and then i'm going to save again as you
19:23 - can see on the style
19:24 - nothing to compile the next step that
19:27 - i'm going to do is to customize
19:29 - bootstrap
19:29 - so here you're going to override some of
19:31 - the bootstrap defaults so that you can
19:33 - achieve the needs that you want
19:34 - on the project i'm going to create a
19:36 - custom source file
19:38 - which is going to keep all the variables
19:39 - that you're going to override in
19:40 - bootstrap
19:41 - and this is because it is not good
19:43 - practice to modify or edit the bootstrap
19:45 - call files
19:47 - so inside the sss folder and this is the
19:49 - folder that we said you're going to keep
19:50 - all the sauce files i'm going to create
19:52 - that
19:53 - file so i'm going to create it as a
19:56 - passion that means it will have an
19:58 - underscore
19:58 - and the underscore lets us know that the
20:00 - file is only a partial and should not be
20:02 - generated
20:03 - into a style sheet so we have the
20:05 - underscore and then custom
20:08 - dot ss
20:11 - so inside this file you're going to do
20:12 - copy some of the
20:14 - variables that you're going to override
20:16 - including the bootstrap itself
20:18 - so before you do the overage you're
20:20 - going to import bootstrap
20:22 - and then you're going to see some of the
20:24 - changes that you're going to do inside
20:25 - this file called demingkit.html
20:28 - so this is the file that you're going to
20:29 - see the changes that you're going to
20:31 - override
20:32 - it has some of the bootstrap components
20:34 - like the navbar which are using some of
20:36 - the primary colors
20:37 - we have things like buttons which are
20:40 - using some of the primary and the
20:41 - secondary colors
20:43 - and then we have things like tables we
20:47 - have borders
20:50 - and then if you scroll down here you
20:51 - have alerts so some of these components
20:53 - are using
20:55 - the bootstrap variables that you're
20:56 - going to override
20:58 - so first let's import the bootstrap and
21:00 - then you're going to link this file with
21:02 - the style sheet
21:06 - so we have the comment which is import
21:10 - bootstrap 5
21:14 - and then i'm going to import it using
21:15 - the import add rule
21:18 - so you have the imports
21:26 - so we have node modules and then you
21:29 - have bootstrap
21:31 - and then scss and then you have
21:34 - bootstrap.css so this is the mains file
21:36 - or the main booster file which has
21:38 - everything
21:40 - and then close it with a semicolon then
21:42 - from there we're going to import this
21:44 - custom source file to our main sas file
21:46 - which is the style dot
21:48 - ss so i'm going to open that file and
21:50 - then you're going to import it
21:52 - and use it as a module so here we have
21:54 - the use
21:55 - patrol and then custom
21:59 - and then i'm going to close that with a
22:01 - semicolon and then i'm going to save
22:04 - then i'm going to open this style.load
22:06 - css to the side
22:07 - we're going to see how it's going to be
22:08 - compiled in real time
22:10 - as you can see it has already compiled
22:12 - and now this is our style sheet
22:15 - so we're going to link that style sheet
22:18 - to the dimming kit so i'm going to paint
22:20 - that file
22:21 - and then on the head section i'm going
22:23 - to
22:25 - link that stylesheet so we have the
22:27 - assets
22:29 - css and then style.css
22:32 - so remember this file is available in
22:34 - the description if you want to follow
22:35 - along
22:36 - on this part so i'm going to save and
22:38 - then i'm going to go live
22:40 - and check on the browser how it looks
22:42 - like
22:44 - so this is our file the gamingkit.html
22:47 - you can see
22:48 - some of the defaults like the primary
22:49 - color is blue
22:51 - which is being used here on the navbar
22:53 - you can see the navbar is using that
22:54 - primary color as the blue
22:55 - and that is the defaults so we have
22:58 - things like buttons
22:59 - we have a lats we have table border we
23:02 - have both
23:02 - uh button borders so these are some of
23:06 - the things
23:06 - or some of the defaults that you're
23:08 - going to override
23:10 - using this file and you're going to see
23:12 - some of these
23:13 - changes in this file
23:17 - so remember here we're going to do the
23:19 - overrides
23:20 - for the primary color and replace the
23:22 - blue without primary colors which is
23:25 - purple
23:26 - and the pink color then from there going
23:29 - also to do the
23:30 - over it for the accordion button you can
23:32 - see this button you need to replace that
23:35 - with our plus icon so if you scroll down
23:38 - here on the
23:40 - testimonials you can see now
23:43 - you're going to replace this button
23:45 - which is the defaults to
23:47 - the plus and the dash cycle
23:51 - so you can see the default on the
23:52 - bootstrap we have this chevron up
23:54 - and the chevron down so you're going to
23:57 - override some of those defaults
23:59 - and this file is going to help us see
24:02 - some of the changes that you're going to
24:03 - do
24:05 - so the next thing now to do is to copy
24:07 - some of the
24:08 - things that you want to override the
24:10 - colors remember here
24:11 - we have used the blue the blue is the
24:13 - default
24:14 - so we're going to copy them from the
24:16 - bootstrap variables file which can be
24:18 - found inside the node modules
24:21 - and then we have the bootstrap scss
24:25 - and then down here we have the variables
24:28 - file
24:28 - so i'm going to open that so here you
24:31 - can see the primary color is assigned to
24:34 - that blue
24:35 - color as the default so i'm going to
24:38 - start with the
24:39 - gray colors and the white color so i'm
24:41 - going to copy the entire
24:42 - gray white and black colors
24:46 - to my custom
24:49 - so first i'm going to write a comment
24:53 - white and
24:57 - gray colors
25:05 - so then again we need to remove the
25:07 - default flag
25:08 - once you copy you must remove the
25:09 - default flag so i'm going to select all
25:11 - of them
25:14 - and then save so let's copy also
25:18 - the primary so that we can assign it our
25:21 - theme colors the one we have used in our
25:23 - layout so before you copy the primer we
25:27 - need to copy also the purple
25:29 - and the pink colors
25:34 - and that one i'm going to copy them at
25:38 - the top of that file
25:41 - so my theme colors
25:46 - paste and then
25:50 - let's copy also the primary and the
25:52 - secondary color
25:56 - so those are the two colors that we need
25:59 - others can remain as default
26:06 - so here we're going to sign i'll provide
26:09 - color to that
26:10 - purple
26:15 - and then for a secondary color we're
26:16 - going to change that
26:18 - to the pink color
26:21 - so also this one we need to remove the
26:23 - defaults
26:28 - and then i'm going to save we are going
26:30 - to see the real changes
26:33 - so now as you can see our theme they
26:35 - make it has changed the colors
26:37 - so now from blue to purple and also a
26:40 - secondary color from greyhound
26:41 - 900 to the pink so but this is not the
26:45 - color that you have used
26:46 - in our layout so again if you check from
26:48 - our layouts
26:50 - so we have this purple and this pink and
26:52 - these are different
26:54 - hex values so i have them here on my
26:56 - notepad so we're going to
26:57 - assign them to our gray color and our
27:00 - pink color
27:02 - so let's start with the purple and this
27:03 - one i'm going to modify a bit i'm going
27:05 - to call it
27:06 - purple dark because i have two colors
27:10 - so i'm going to duplicate that and then
27:12 - change from
27:15 - dark to light so for the first color
27:20 - i have it here this is my theme color so
27:22 - i'm going to copy
27:26 - paste we have the second color
27:32 - copy
27:34 - paste and then the pink color
27:40 - copy
27:44 - paste and then here we need to assign
27:47 - that color which is
27:49 - purple duck and then i'm going to save
27:53 - let's see the overheads in our naming
27:56 - kit.html
27:58 - so you can see now our dimming kit has
28:00 - reflected the colors that we have
28:01 - changed
28:02 - so these are the colors that are used on
28:04 - our layouts
28:06 - so again if you check here from the
28:08 - layout
28:10 - we need to do another override and that
28:12 - is
28:14 - the accordion buttons for collapsing so
28:18 - you can see here
28:19 - the default is what we have here on the
28:21 - demikit we have this
28:24 - this chevron app and then the chevron
28:27 - done so we need to replace that with our
28:28 - custom
28:31 - buttons which is the plus and
28:36 - the dash circle
28:41 - so just like we did with the colors i'm
28:42 - going to do the overrides for the
28:44 - accordion variable
28:46 - so let's copy that variable to our
28:48 - custom
28:49 - so inside the variables i'm going to
28:50 - search for that accordion variable
28:53 - so i'm going to write accordion
28:57 - and here you'll see we have a number of
28:58 - accordion variables
29:00 - so first i'm going to copy the variables
29:04 - responsible for the colors of the icons
29:07 - and here we have the accordion icon
29:08 - color and another one which is accordion
29:11 - icon active color
29:12 - so these are the two variables
29:13 - responsible for the icon colors
29:17 - so i'm going to copy the two and then
29:20 - inside my custom first i'm going to
29:23 - write a comment
29:24 - so we have the accordion
29:28 - overrides
29:33 - and then for the accordion icon color
29:36 - i'm going i'm going to assign it to our
29:37 - primary color
29:39 - so that is the primary variable
29:44 - and then for the active icon i'm going
29:46 - to assign it
29:47 - our secondary color so that is the
29:50 - secondary
29:52 - variable
29:55 - then we're going to copy another
29:56 - variable which is
29:59 - the variable for the icons so we have
30:01 - the two variables which is the
30:03 - accordion button icon which has this svg
30:06 - icon for the chevron app
30:08 - so if you look properly here you'll see
30:10 - we have the svg
30:12 - code for that
30:15 - chevron app and then for the active icon
30:17 - we have the chevron down so i'm going to
30:19 - copy the two
30:21 - variables and then you're going to
30:24 - replace
30:26 - the icons with the plus icon and the
30:28 - dash circle
30:29 - so inside the custom
30:35 - i'm going to replace and then remove the
30:37 - default flag
30:45 - and then you're going to replace this
30:48 - svg
30:49 - code with the plus icon code
30:54 - so the question is where are we going to
30:56 - get the svg code so there are so many
30:58 - sources that you can get the svg code
31:00 - but i highly recommend that you use the
31:01 - bootstrap icons
31:03 - so you can go to icons.getbootstrap.com
31:06 - so here you're going to search for the
31:07 - icons that you're going to replace with
31:08 - the default which is the chevron app and
31:10 - chevron down
31:12 - so here i'm going to start with the
31:14 - first icon
31:15 - for the chevron app and i'm going to
31:16 - replace that with the plus icon so i'm
31:18 - going to
31:19 - just type plus
31:22 - so here you'll see the different
31:23 - versions of the plus icon
31:25 - and we are only interested with the one
31:27 - with the circle and we have the plus
31:29 - circle
31:30 - so i'm going to click on that icon
31:33 - and here you'll see the different ways
31:34 - of using this icon and you're only
31:37 - interested
31:37 - with the svg code so i'm going to copy
31:39 - the html
31:41 - code for that icon
31:44 - and then i'm going to paste it on my
31:46 - notepad
31:50 - so here we're going to replace the
31:52 - dimension
31:53 - code so i'm going to copy for there you
31:55 - have you can see here we have the two
31:56 - path
31:58 - so i'm going to copy the path for the
32:00 - first dimension
32:01 - or the dimension for the first path and
32:04 - then
32:06 - i'm going to replace the chevron up
32:09 - so where we have the dimension only
32:11 - replace that i'm going to select it
32:15 - and then paste then i'm going to copy
32:20 - the second path the entire path
32:25 - and then again i'm going to paste it
32:29 - here and then
32:32 - you need to remove the double quotes and
32:34 - replace that with a single quote
32:40 - double quote replace that with a single
32:43 - quote
32:44 - i'm going to save that file and then i'm
32:47 - going to check
32:49 - from our dimming kit so here you can see
32:52 - it has already replaced
32:54 - or done the override for that icon you
32:56 - can see now we have the plus
32:58 - circle so let's go ahead and replace the
33:02 - second one which is the chevron down
33:05 - with the
33:05 - dash circle so again just like we did
33:08 - you're going back to
33:12 - the search and you're going to search
33:14 - for that circle
33:15 - or for that circle so here i'm going to
33:18 - type
33:20 - dash circle
33:24 - so we have the dash circle and here we
33:27 - have it
33:29 - so again you have different ways of
33:31 - using this icon we are only interested
33:33 - with html code for that svg
33:37 - so copy again on my notepad
33:42 - so just like we did i'm going to copy
33:44 - the dimension only for the first path
33:48 - and then again i'm going to replace for
33:50 - the second
33:52 - icon which is the chevron down
33:56 - paste
33:59 - and then they copy the second part the
34:01 - entire path
34:04 - and then again here paste remove the
34:07 - double quotes
34:08 - and replace that with a single quote
34:14 - single quote and then save so let's see
34:16 - the overage on our dimming kit
34:21 - and there you have it you can see it has
34:23 - replaced that
34:24 - now we have the dust circle for the
34:27 - active
34:28 - and the plastic for the
34:31 - inactive icon so i think we're done with
34:35 - that part
34:35 - the only thing we can do is just add
34:38 - some
34:39 - we can increase the font size of the
34:40 - icon so again you're going to copy the
34:43 - variables
34:44 - or the variable for that icon
34:47 - so here on the variables file you can
34:48 - see we have that variable for that
34:51 - icon width so i'm going to copy the
34:54 - accordion icon width
35:00 - copy to a custom
35:08 - so i'm going to replace the default
35:09 - which is 1.255 ram
35:12 - with 1.875 ram
35:17 - save check on the browser
35:20 - and there you have it you can see now
35:23 - it has increased the wind of the icon
35:28 - and that is exactly what we have on our
35:30 - layouts
35:32 - so i think we are done with that part
35:39 - welcome back in this video we are going
35:41 - to create the file structure for our
35:43 - project
35:44 - and this is to make sure that we have a
35:45 - code that is well organized and
35:47 - maintainable
35:48 - so i'm going to create all the sas files
35:50 - for the sections and the components
35:53 - so on the sss folder i'm going to create
35:55 - the two folders
35:56 - so the first folder i'm going to keep
35:58 - all the sas files for the sections
36:00 - and the second folder i'm going to keep
36:01 - all the sas files for the components
36:03 - links like buttons make sense and
36:06 - animations and so much more so let's
36:09 - start with the first folder which is the
36:11 - sections folder so inside the sss folder
36:16 - we have the sections
36:21 - and another folder also inside the sss
36:23 - folder
36:25 - and this one we're going to keep all the
36:26 - search files for the components
36:37 - so let's start by creating the sas files
36:39 - for the components and i
36:40 - am going to start with the first one
36:41 - which is the button so
36:43 - apache underscore buttons dot
36:47 - ss
36:52 - so we're going to keep all the code for
36:53 - the buttons on that file
36:55 - another file or another component file
37:00 - and this one we're going to keep all the
37:01 - animations so underscore
37:03 - animations dot scss
37:12 - another file or another component file
37:14 - and this one
37:15 - we're going to keep all the mixins
37:19 - so underscore makesense.css
37:39 - also another source file or another
37:41 - component file
37:43 - and this one you're going to keep all
37:44 - the typography so
37:46 - underscore typography
37:52 - dot ss
37:55 - so i think we're done with the
37:57 - components let's create the sas files
37:59 - for the sections
38:01 - so the first section is the number again
38:04 - underscore
38:06 - navbar.css
38:10 - so that is our first section of the
38:12 - layout
38:14 - so let's see the second section which is
38:17 - the intro section
38:22 - so underscore intro section
38:27 - dot scss
38:30 - let's see the that one so the third one
38:33 - we have this section
38:35 - for the trusted by companies like so i'm
38:37 - going to call it companies
38:43 - so we have underscore companies
38:48 - dot scss
38:53 - so we have the fourth section which is
38:55 - the our services
38:56 - or the services section
39:01 - underscore services
39:05 - dot scss
39:09 - so another section which is
39:13 - the testimonials
39:19 - so underscore testimonials.css
39:27 - another section which is the frequently
39:30 - asked questions
39:37 - so again underscore faq dot scss
39:42 - another section which is the latest work
39:45 - i'm going to call it portfolio
39:51 - and that's called portfolio dot
39:54 - scss another section
39:58 - which is the cts section i'm going to
40:01 - call it get started
40:12 - so underscore get started
40:16 - dot scss
40:19 - and finally we have the last section
40:22 - which is the footer
40:28 - underscore footer.css
40:35 - so the next step now is to import these
40:37 - partials to our main
40:38 - sas file which is the style.css
40:45 - so here i'm going to start with the
40:47 - components and i'm going to write a
40:48 - comment first
40:49 - which is imports the components
40:59 - so we have the use at rule
41:02 - and then the components folder
41:13 - and then you're going to start with the
41:15 - animations
41:16 - and then close it
41:20 - then i'm going to duplicate three times
41:24 - so we have the second component which is
41:28 - the buttons and then the that one
41:33 - which is the make sense and then
41:36 - we have the third one which is the
41:39 - typography
41:41 - so let's do the same for the sections
41:44 - comment first
41:45 - so import
41:48 - the sections
41:54 - so again the use our tool
41:58 - and then we have the sections folder
42:04 - so we're going to start with the number
42:05 - which is the first section of our
42:07 - layouts
42:08 - and then i'm going to close that and
42:10 - then duplicate eight times
42:12 - to total to nine so we have
42:15 - one two three four five
42:18 - six seven eight so the second section
42:23 - we're going to import
42:26 - the intro section we have the that
42:29 - section which is the company's
42:34 - the third one which is the services
42:40 - we have the fifth fifth section which is
42:43 - the testimonials
42:48 - then we have the next section which is
42:56 - so we have the frequently asked
42:58 - questions
43:03 - and then the next section which is
43:06 - the portfolio
43:09 - the next one is the get started
43:13 - and finally we have the last one which
43:16 - is
43:16 - the footer
43:20 - so i'm going to save that file
43:24 - so now this file is going to import all
43:26 - these partials with the code
43:29 - and we are done with that part
43:33 - welcome back in this video we are going
43:35 - to start creating our project
43:36 - and you're going to start with section
43:38 - one of all out which is the navbar
43:40 - so on the number we have a logo which is
43:43 - also known as the nav brand
43:44 - and then we have the menus and here we
43:46 - have a button with a
43:48 - phone number so let's get started and
43:51 - create something similar like what we
43:52 - have on the layout
43:54 - so inside the project i'm going to
43:56 - create a file called index.html
44:04 - and then i'm going to add html starter
44:07 - code
44:09 - using emits so you're going to do a few
44:12 - things on this
44:13 - file the first one is to make sure that
44:14 - you're using the correct viewports
44:17 - and then you're going to add the title
44:18 - and then link it with that style sheet
44:20 - and also add the javascript
44:24 - so let's start with the viewport and
44:26 - we're going to check it from the
44:27 - bootstrap documentation
44:29 - so here on the introduction we have
44:31 - something we call the
44:32 - starter template it says be sure to have
44:35 - your pages set up with the latest design
44:36 - and development standards
44:38 - that means using an html5 doctype and
44:41 - including a viewport meta tag for proper
44:43 - responsive behaviors
44:45 - put it all together and the pages should
44:46 - look like this
44:48 - so here we're going to copy the viewport
44:50 - meta tag
44:53 - and then replace with what we have here
44:55 - on the
44:56 - file
44:59 - so let's add the title and i'm going to
45:02 - write learning bootstrap
45:09 - version 5 with sas
45:16 - then we need also now to link the style
45:18 - sheet
45:20 - so you have the link and then assets
45:23 - folder
45:26 - css and then style.css
45:29 - then from there we're going to link the
45:31 - javascript and here
45:33 - from the documentation you have two
45:34 - options the first option is by using the
45:36 - bootstrap bundle
45:37 - which has the popper and the second
45:40 - option is by using them as separate
45:42 - files that is the pop-up and the
45:43 - bootstrap javascript
45:45 - so here again you have the option to
45:47 - either link them using the cdn
45:49 - or downloading the source files i've
45:51 - already downloaded the source files
45:53 - and i have them in my project so we have
45:55 - the assets and then we have this folder
45:57 - called
45:57 - js so i'm going to link that file using
46:00 - the bootstrap bundle
46:02 - dot js
46:05 - so below the end of the body i'm going
46:07 - to
46:09 - add the scripts
46:14 - so we have the source
46:18 - so we have the assets folder
46:25 - and then the js and then i'm going to
46:28 - link it with the bootstrap bundle.js
46:31 - so i'm going to save the file so the
46:34 - starter template is ready we can go
46:35 - ahead and create the navbar
46:37 - so i'm going to start with a comment so
46:40 - we have the start
46:43 - the number section
46:49 - so to save time i'm going to copy the
46:51 - code from the bootstrap documentation
46:55 - so here i'm going to go to components
46:58 - and then down here we have the navbar
47:02 - so here i'm going to scroll down till i
47:04 - find the version that i want
47:06 - so i'm going to copy the this code
47:12 - and then i'm going to
47:16 - paste so you can see now here
47:20 - we have a class called container fluid
47:22 - so in booster version 5
47:24 - a container must be within the navbar
47:28 - and you have the option to either use
47:30 - the the container
47:32 - fluid class or the container class so
47:34 - i'm going to use the container class
47:37 - so i'm going to save that and then
47:39 - you're going to see
47:41 - this page on our browser
47:45 - so i'm going to go live and here we have
47:48 - the navbar so we need to change the
47:50 - color so i'm going to change from bg
47:53 - light to bg primary
48:00 - so there you have it so before we start
48:03 - the number we need to do a few things on
48:05 - it the first one is to add the logo
48:08 - and then push these menus to the right
48:10 - and then make sure that the menus
48:12 - reflect what we have here
48:14 - on the layout
48:19 - so here we are going to start by pushing
48:21 - the menus to the right
48:22 - and here i'm going to add a class called
48:24 - justify content
48:26 - end so i'm going to add that class where
48:28 - we have the collapse
48:30 - class so we have that glass
48:34 - and then you're going to add the logo
48:37 - on the nav brand so you're going to use
48:41 - an image
48:43 - and here i'm going to create a folder
48:44 - called images so you're going to keep
48:46 - that logo inside that
48:49 - folder so we have the images and then
48:51 - the name of that logo which is
48:53 - logo.png
48:56 - and then we have the alt which is the
48:59 - logo image
49:01 - so let's create that folder so inside
49:04 - the projects
49:06 - [Music]
49:08 - we have the images
49:12 - then inside my project folder i'm going
49:13 - to copy that
49:15 - logo to my projects or to that folder
49:18 - so i'm going to drag inside my project
49:20 - folder
49:25 - and then i'm going also to drag it to
49:27 - that folder
49:29 - so we can see the results so far on the
49:32 - browser
49:33 - and there you have it you can see the
49:35 - logo and then the menus have been pushed
49:36 - to the
49:37 - right so we need to make sure that they
49:39 - reflect what we have on the layout
49:42 - so we have the home services
49:43 - testimonials frequently asked question
49:45 - portfolio contact
49:46 - and then the button
49:52 - so we have the second menu
49:55 - which is the services
50:01 - we have the that one
50:10 - testimonials
50:17 - so i'm going to duplicate the third one
50:22 - three times so we have the frequently
50:25 - asked question
50:27 - we have portfolio
50:31 - and then we have contacts
50:35 - and then we have that button so i'm
50:38 - going to
50:39 - to remove this one the disabled link
50:45 - so here we before we do that we're going
50:47 - to add the
50:48 - button at the end so we have the button
50:53 - the type of the button is button
51:01 - and then we have
51:04 - the class for that button
51:08 - so for now we're going to use rounded
51:10 - peel to give it that rounded shape
51:13 - we're going to add our own class
51:19 - and then here going to add the telephone
51:21 - number so we have the
51:24 - plus 1 and then 0
51:28 - 2 8 3 6 5
51:31 - 4 1 3.
51:34 - save let's see the result so far
51:38 - so there you have it now we can start
51:41 - styling so here we're going to do the
51:44 - styling on the sas file for this section
51:46 - which is the navbar.css so i'm going to
51:49 - open that file
51:50 - and then here i'm going to create a new
51:52 - class which you're going to add to the
51:53 - navbar
51:54 - i'm going to call this class menu
51:59 - so on the main we're going to create a
52:00 - gradient background
52:02 - so if you check here from the layout you
52:04 - can see
52:05 - here we have a gradient and these are
52:08 - two colors we have the primary on the
52:09 - left
52:10 - that is our primary color and then on
52:12 - the right we have that secondary color
52:15 - or the secondary variable so let's
52:18 - create that
52:18 - gradient so we have the background
52:23 - and then i'm going to use linear
52:25 - gradient
52:27 - so here we need to specify the direction
52:29 - of the color so going to say
52:31 - to write
52:34 - and then we're going to use rgba
52:41 - so we have our first color which is the
52:44 - primary with an opacity of 0.95
52:51 - then we need the second color again rgba
52:56 - which is our secondary color
53:00 - with an opacity of 0.95
53:06 - i'm going to save the file make sure the
53:07 - script is running and then add this
53:09 - class to the navbar
53:12 - so i'm going to remove the bg primary
53:14 - and replace with that
53:17 - menu class so i'm going to save
53:21 - let's see the results on the browser
53:27 - so what you're getting is an error for
53:29 - undefined variable
53:31 - and that is because the sas cannot be
53:33 - able to get the modules with the
53:34 - variables
53:36 - so to use mixins or variables of these
53:38 - modules we have to call them using
53:40 - namespaces and by default the namespace
53:42 - is the file name without the extension
53:45 - so here on the navbar we need to call
53:46 - that module which is the custom.css file
53:49 - so this is the module which has all the
53:50 - variables
53:51 - mixins and the bootstrap so here we have
53:54 - the
53:54 - use at rule and then we need to go back
53:58 - to directories so we have the two dots
54:00 - and then
54:01 - we have the custom so here we need to
54:04 - use the namespace
54:05 - and you have two options you can either
54:06 - use it as custom
54:08 - or just plain c so we're going to use it
54:12 - as custom
54:14 - and then close that and then i'm going
54:16 - to save
54:17 - let's see from the browser
54:20 - so still you're getting an error so to
54:22 - fix that we need to remove the namespace
54:25 - so here we're not going to use it with
54:26 - the namespace so we're going to use it
54:28 - as a star so the star tells us to remove
54:31 - the namespaces so i'm going to save
54:33 - let's see and
54:36 - there you have it you can see now it is
54:38 - working
54:40 - so let's continue styling so we need to
54:43 - add the color
54:44 - and do some padding on the menu items or
54:47 - the nav items
54:49 - so here you're going to nest it so we
54:52 - have the li
54:54 - we're going to do some padding
54:57 - so for the top and bottom you're going
54:59 - to put 0 and then
55:01 - left and right 0.7 ram
55:05 - save let's see and
55:08 - there you have it you can see now we
55:09 - have some padding on the nav items
55:13 - so let's change the color to white so we
55:15 - have the links
55:17 - so we have the color so here we need to
55:22 - put white
55:25 - and then some text transform
55:29 - to capitalize and then some
55:33 - font to it you're going to have 600
55:38 - so save let's see
55:42 - so you can see the menus are bold but
55:45 - the colors has not changed so here we're
55:48 - going to fix that
55:49 - with the important so we have the
55:52 - important on the color
55:54 - so i'm going to save and
55:57 - there you have it so let's create a
55:59 - mixing for this gradient because you're
56:01 - going to use it
56:02 - so many times so i'm going to open that
56:05 - component which is
56:06 - the mixing.css file
56:10 - so here going to copy this gradient
56:14 - so first let's create that mixing
56:17 - so we have the gradient
56:20 - mixing so that is a comment
56:25 - so we have the at mixing
56:29 - and the name of that mixing you're going
56:30 - to call it gradient
56:36 - so let's copy that background gradient
56:39 - so i'm going to
56:40 - cut actually cut and then here we're
56:43 - going to include
56:44 - it and then the name of that
56:47 - mixing is gradient
56:53 - so let's copy that gradient to the
56:56 - mixing
56:57 - so i'm going to save the two files
57:00 - so our gradient should remain intact or
57:03 - our number
57:04 - so here we're getting an error for
57:07 - undefined mixing so here
57:08 - on the mixing we need to include that
57:10 - module so
57:11 - just like we did with the number we need
57:13 - to include that module which is the
57:15 - custom.css file
57:18 - so it should be at the top so we're
57:21 - going to
57:22 - paste and then save let's see
57:26 - so still you're getting an error for
57:27 - undefined mixing this time
57:29 - so we need to also include that module
57:33 - on the navbar so the mixing components
57:37 - so again we have the use at rule
57:41 - and then we have
57:46 - sorry we have
57:50 - the components and then the mixins
57:53 - so again use it as star
57:57 - close save check on the browser
58:00 - and there you have it so without mixing
58:04 - now we can be able to reuse it
58:07 - everywhere we want to use that gradient
58:09 - so the next step now is to work on the
58:11 - button and we need to create something
58:14 - similar like what we have here on the
58:16 - layout
58:18 - so we're going to do that on the sas
58:19 - file for that component which is the
58:21 - buttons
58:22 - dot scss so here i'm going to create a
58:25 - new class
58:26 - which is going to style that button and
58:28 - i'm going to call it
58:29 - btn rounded
58:34 - so i'm going to start by setting the
58:36 - position
58:38 - to relative
58:42 - and then some padding
58:46 - for the top and bottom we're going to
58:47 - set that to 0.9
58:52 - ram and then left and right 1.25
58:56 - ram then some font weight
59:00 - i'm going to set that to 500
59:03 - and then margin i'm going to set that to
59:07 - zero
59:10 - i'm going to save then add that class
59:14 - to the button so we have the rounded
59:16 - pill and then
59:17 - btn rounded
59:21 - so save let's see from the browser
59:24 - and there you have it so we need to
59:26 - remove this dark border
59:28 - and replace that with the white border
59:31 - and then
59:32 - add this rounded circle which has this
59:34 - icon
59:38 - so here we're going to put that icon
59:40 - inside a span so i'm going to create a
59:42 - span
59:44 - and then on the buttons
59:47 - we are going to nest it the way we have
59:49 - done so we have the span inside the bit
59:51 - and rounded
59:52 - span
59:56 - so here i'm going to start by setting
59:57 - the position to absolute
60:01 - absolute and then background color of
60:05 - that
60:05 - rounded circle which is going to be
60:08 - primary
60:12 - then we need to set the width and the
60:14 - height
60:15 - of that rounded circle so we're going to
60:18 - use
60:18 - 2.5 ram we can change that if it's too
60:23 - large or too small and then also for the
60:26 - height
60:28 - 2.5 ram
60:35 - so then from there we're going to add
60:38 - the module they've done here on the
60:41 - navbar we need to include this
60:43 - module so i'm going to copy
60:47 - so remember here we have used this
60:48 - variable so we need to
60:50 - add it there and then save let's see
60:52 - from the browser
60:55 - so you can see now we have a span but
60:57 - that is not the position that you want
60:59 - it we want it inside the
61:01 - button so let's first change the border
61:03 - and then
61:05 - give it that position
61:09 - so for the border we are going to set
61:12 - the border
61:18 - so win the 0.1 ram solid
61:23 - and then the color you're going to use
61:25 - rgba
61:26 - which you're going to set that to white
61:32 - with an opacity of 0.6
61:36 - then we need to position this span
61:40 - so this one should be closed with a
61:42 - semicolon
61:45 - so for the top set that to 50 percent
61:51 - write
61:55 - 5px
61:59 - then we need to translate y that is
62:02 - transform
62:05 - translate y
62:09 - minus 50 percent
62:14 - so i'm going to save let's see
62:18 - so you can see now at least we have it
62:21 - on the position that you want but we
62:22 - need to make sure that it's rounded and
62:24 - then
62:24 - do some padding on the btn rounded
62:31 - so for the spawn you're going to set the
62:32 - border radius
62:34 - to 50
62:40 - and then on the bottom
62:44 - so this one should be 2.5 frame so
62:46 - you're going to set
62:48 - the padding for individual side so for
62:51 - the top you're going to
62:52 - leave it that to 0.9375
62:57 - and then left
63:00 - four points
63:04 - ram and then for the bottom 0.9375 ram
63:13 - the same with the top and then the other
63:16 - one you're going to leave it at
63:17 - 1.25 ram so i'm going to save let's see
63:22 - and there you have it that is our button
63:26 - so now from there we're going to add the
63:27 - phone icon and here we're going to use
63:29 - the font awesome icons
63:31 - so on html you're going to add that icon
63:33 - inside the span
63:35 - so we have the icon and then the class
63:38 - font or some solid
63:40 - and then the name of that icon is phone
63:42 - alt
63:46 - so here you're going to compile the font
63:49 - or some sas file
63:50 - so that you can be able to link that
63:52 - style sheet
63:53 - on the head section so inside the sss
63:56 - folder i'm going to create that sas file
63:58 - so i'm going to call it font awesome
64:02 - dot scss
64:05 - so here you're going to import four
64:07 - files so we have the first one
64:10 - so we have the user tool
64:13 - and then the node modules font awesome
64:18 - and then ss so you're going to start
64:20 - with the brands
64:22 - that is the phontosum for the brands
64:25 - and then close duplicates
64:29 - three times so the second second one
64:32 - we're going to import the
64:34 - regular and then we have the third one
64:39 - which is the font awesome dot css
64:42 - and then finally we have the solid
64:47 - so i'm going to save and then here you
64:50 - can see it has already compiled
64:53 - our font awesome dot css so we need to
64:55 - link that style sheet
64:56 - to the head section so you have the link
65:02 - and then assets
65:05 - css and then fontosum.css
65:08 - so from there now we're going to copy
65:10 - the web fonts to the to our assets
65:12 - folder
65:13 - and the fonts can be found inside the
65:15 - node
65:16 - modules so we're going to copy them from
65:18 - the
65:19 - font awesome folder
65:22 - so here we have that folder so i'm going
65:24 - to copy it to the assets folder
65:30 - so paste so now we'll be able to see
65:34 - our icon so i'm going to the browser and
65:37 - here you can see now we have that icon
65:41 - so the next step is to style that icon
65:44 - so inside the buttons
65:47 - we're going to nest it inside the span
65:48 - just like we have done on the html so we
65:50 - have the icon
65:52 - so the color should be white
65:56 - so we have the white variable
66:00 - and then also we need to position
66:04 - at the center so here you're going just
66:06 - to define
66:07 - or specify the font size
66:10 - or set the font size to one ram
66:14 - and then also the line height
66:18 - so you have the line height which you're
66:20 - going to set that 2.5
66:22 - frame so let's see save
66:26 - and there you have it so you can see now
66:28 - it is at the center of that
66:30 - circle and that is the position that we
66:32 - want it
66:35 - so let's add the background color for
66:37 - this
66:38 - button to white so on the btn round
66:42 - we are going to add that background
66:44 - color
66:47 - so we have white
66:51 - save let's see and there you have it
66:55 - so the next one now is to make sure that
66:57 - we create the hoover effect
66:58 - as you can see here from the layout so
67:01 - once you hover you'll see that
67:03 - gradients
67:06 - so let's work on that
67:11 - so here on the btn round we are going to
67:15 - create that hoover so we have the hover
67:21 - so the background color so here we're
67:25 - going to call the
67:26 - to use the mixing so we have to include
67:28 - it
67:30 - so include gradients
67:37 - save let's see so we're getting
67:41 - an error for undefined mixing so you
67:42 - need to include that module inside
67:44 - this file so just like we did with the
67:47 - navbar
67:48 - i'm going to copy that module copy
67:54 - paste
67:57 - and now you can see we have that hoover
68:00 - with that gradient so we need to change
68:01 - the color once you hover the
68:03 - button and also this rounded circle
68:08 - so on the hoover we need to set the
68:10 - color to white
68:12 - so we have color
68:16 - which is white so i'm going to save
68:18 - let's see from the browser
68:20 - so now you can see once you hover the
68:22 - button the color turns to white
68:24 - so now let's work on this circle so we
68:26 - need a dark circle once you hover there
68:28 - but the button
68:31 - so the span should be inside the hoover
68:33 - so we have
68:35 - the span and then the background color
68:40 - so we are going to use rgba and they're
68:43 - going to use a dark color
68:44 - so we have the black with an opacity of
68:48 - 0.6
68:51 - so i'm going to save let's see
68:54 - so if you hover now you can see our
68:56 - circuit turns to dark color
68:59 - and that is exactly what we need
69:02 - so if we check from the layout now you
69:04 - can see the only thing we need to do is
69:06 - bolden the text you can see ours
69:09 - is a bit light so we need to add to
69:12 - increase the font size the font weight
69:15 - so on the b10 round you need to increase
69:17 - the font weight to around 600
69:22 - or let me have 700 save let's see
69:27 - and there you have it
69:34 - so i think we are done with our parts so
69:37 - the next step now is to make sure that
69:38 - our navbar is fully responsive across
69:41 - variety of
69:41 - screen devices and to do that i'm going
69:43 - to right click and inspect elements
69:47 - so this is how our navbar looks like on
69:49 - moto g4
69:50 - and this is a device with a screen
69:52 - window of 360.
69:54 - so we click here on the navbar toggler
69:56 - you can be able to reveal the menu
69:58 - so first let's change the color of this
70:00 - navbar toggle to a light color
70:02 - so here we have the class which you're
70:04 - going to change from number light to
70:05 - navbar
70:06 - dark so
70:09 - save let's see and
70:12 - there you have it you can see now it
70:13 - just changed to that light color
70:17 - so something else is we can even hide
70:19 - the button on small devices
70:21 - and that is targeting devices with a
70:24 - screen width of 600 and below or
70:26 - 575 and below so to do that you can
70:30 - either write the media query on the
70:32 - button where we have that
70:33 - btn rounded
70:36 - so bootstrap has some of the mixing that
70:39 - you can use to create
70:41 - a media queries so here we can include
70:44 - that mixing
70:45 - at the top and only hide that button on
70:48 - small devices
70:49 - with a screen window of 600 and below so
70:52 - we have the include
70:53 - that mixing so the mixing is media
70:57 - breakpoint
71:01 - down if you're targeting small devices
71:04 - then you can write down
71:05 - if you're targeting large devices then
71:07 - you can say up
71:09 - so down and then the
71:12 - device we want to target is a small
71:14 - device so you need to use the initials
71:16 - which is
71:16 - sm and then here we need to write
71:20 - what you want to do so the properties
71:23 - we're going to set the display to learn
71:27 - so display none
71:32 - so i'm going to save let's say from the
71:35 - browser
71:37 - so now if you click on the navbar
71:39 - toggler you can't be able to see
71:41 - the button on small devices
71:45 - with a screen device or screen width of
71:47 - 600 and below
71:49 - so to confirm that we need to open our
71:51 - compile css
71:52 - that is the style.css i'm going to open
71:54 - to the side and see that media query
71:57 - so here i'm going to search for that
71:59 - class which is btn
72:02 - rounded so
72:05 - down here you can see that media query
72:06 - it has already compiled so media query
72:09 - marks win 575.98
72:11 - px and you can see the display is set to
72:14 - none
72:15 - so you can see here any device with a
72:17 - max window 575
72:19 - the display should be set to none so it
72:22 - will not be able to display that
72:23 - button so let me show you if you're
72:26 - targeting a large device
72:28 - so here we can change the media player
72:30 - breakpoint to media breakpoint up
72:35 - so save let's see the media query and
72:37 - here you can see the media query has
72:38 - changed to minimum width
72:40 - of 7 576. so if you check again from the
72:44 - browser now
72:46 - our button can be able to be seen on
72:48 - small devices
72:49 - but on large devices for example let's
72:51 - go to a large device like an ipad pro
72:54 - and you can see now we can be able to
72:56 - see the button
72:57 - so it depends on what you want to target
73:00 - so again here we need to change that to
73:02 - down because you only want
73:05 - the button to be displayed on
73:08 - large devices only so here targeting a
73:11 - small device to display
73:13 - none
73:16 - so i think we are now our navba is fully
73:20 - responsive
73:20 - and everything is working perfectly fine
73:27 - welcome back in this video we are going
73:29 - to create section 2 of our layout
73:31 - which is the intro section so here
73:33 - you're going to start by creating this
73:34 - intro heading and then on the right
73:37 - you're going to create this illustration
73:38 - and this animated button and also this
73:41 - wavy background
73:43 - so let's get started so on the html
73:46 - let's create that section
73:48 - so here i'm going to start with the
73:49 - comments which is
73:51 - start the intro
73:58 - section so here we have that section
74:02 - with an id of home and a class of
74:06 - intro section
74:10 - which will have a container
74:15 - and the row and i'm going to create the
74:19 - two columns so i'm going to group them
74:21 - we have call md6
74:25 - and another one called intros so here
74:28 - i'm going to say times
74:30 - 2 to create the two columns so i'm going
74:32 - to hit tab to create
74:34 - them at once
74:37 - so here i'm going to start with the
74:38 - content for the first column and then
74:40 - you're going to style it
74:41 - later so from the left we have this
74:45 - display
74:46 - or heading and then we have description
74:48 - and then the button
74:51 - so for the heading you're going to use
74:52 - h1 with a class of
74:54 - display two display two is a bootstrap
74:56 - heading class
74:59 - and then you're going to start that
75:01 - heading so you're going to use the span
75:05 - with a class of display tool
75:08 - and then you're going to modify that
75:10 - with intro
75:13 - so let me copy the text for the heading
75:16 - or the display copy
75:21 - and then paste and then i'm going to
75:24 - duplicate
75:25 - and then change that modifier to
75:28 - description
75:32 - so let me copy the text
75:41 - paste
75:45 - so let's create the button so here i'm
75:48 - going to copy from the navbar
75:53 - copy paste
75:56 - and then change the content and the icon
76:00 - so the content is get in touch
76:07 - and then the name of that icon is arrow
76:09 - right
76:16 - so this is how our content looks like on
76:18 - the browser so we need to do
76:20 - some styling on that heading
76:23 - in the description so on the typography
76:26 - i'm going to open that
76:27 - sas file so here we're going to use the
76:30 - block element modifier to style the
76:32 - heading
76:33 - and the description so we have that
76:35 - class called the display tool
76:40 - and here going to set the margin bottom
76:44 - to one rem and then text transform
76:51 - i'm going to set that to capitalize
76:54 - then you're going to modify the intro so
76:57 - you have that
76:58 - symbol or the app percent and then the
77:01 - two dash
77:02 - and then intro
77:06 - so we're going to set the display to
77:10 - inline block
77:13 - and then font weights
77:17 - i'm going to set that to 700.
77:20 - so let's do the same also for
77:24 - the description we have that and then
77:26 - the two dashes
77:27 - and then description
77:32 - so if you noticed here on the intro i
77:33 - didn't specify the font size so i wanted
77:36 - to use the
77:37 - display to font size that is available
77:40 - in bootstrap
77:42 - so for the description we're going to
77:43 - set the font size to one ram
77:46 - so we have the font size
77:50 - one ram
77:54 - and then here i'm going to set also the
77:56 - display
77:57 - to block
78:01 - so i'm going to save and then
78:05 - we need also to include the modules so
78:07 - i'm going to copy them from the
78:10 - buttons so i'm going to copy the
78:16 - the first one
78:21 - paste and then save so if you check now
78:25 - from the browser this
78:26 - is how our content looks like
78:30 - so we need to style the intro section
78:34 - so inside the sas file for that section
78:36 - which is the intro section we're going
78:38 - to
78:39 - set the background
78:43 - so first we need to include the two
78:45 - modules
78:47 - so we have the custom module
78:51 - and the mixing so i'm going to copy the
78:53 - two
78:59 - and then paste
79:04 - so we have that class intro section
79:10 - so here we need that gradient so
79:13 - we're going to include that mixing
79:17 - so we have include
79:20 - the name of that mixing is gradient
79:29 - then we need to do some padding so i'm
79:32 - going to use the shorthand and then only
79:34 - specify the top
79:35 - padding which is 10 ram for the rest i'm
79:38 - going to
79:39 - set that to 0 0 0
79:42 - and then also we need to set the
79:46 - width and the height so for the width
79:49 - 100 height
79:52 - also 100
79:56 - so i want the contents or the height to
79:58 - scale with the content
80:01 - so i'm going to save let's see from the
80:04 - browser
80:05 - and there you have it so we need to
80:07 - separate the number and
80:09 - the intersection so here we're going to
80:10 - put the shadow
80:12 - so we need some shadow on the navbar so
80:14 - on the html
80:17 - where we have the number i'm going to
80:18 - include that class or to add that class
80:20 - called shadow
80:22 - and another class called fixed stop
80:27 - save let's see so that is how it looks
80:31 - like now so we need to change the colors
80:33 - for the heading and the description
80:36 - so on the typography we are going to set
80:38 - the two colors
80:43 - so we have the color
80:47 - so we're going to use white save
80:51 - let's see so here we need to include
80:57 - or to add the margin top on the
81:00 - description
81:02 - so we have margin top
81:05 - so i'm going to set that to 1.2 ram
81:09 - so save let's see
81:13 - so instead of using these colors here
81:16 - so we're going to set them on the html
81:18 - so i'm going to remove
81:24 - and then set them on the html
81:29 - so here on the row i'm going to add a
81:32 - line item center
81:38 - and then also add that class text white
81:44 - and then i'm going to save let's see
81:48 - so it's still in so the next step now is
81:51 - to create the font style of this heading
81:54 - if you check from the layout you can see
81:56 - the font style is a bit different so
81:58 - here we're going to use the font called
81:59 - poppins
82:00 - which you're going to get it from google
82:01 - fonts so you can go to fonts.google.com
82:05 - and here you're going to search for that
82:07 - font called puppets so i'm going to type
82:09 - poppins
82:11 - and there it is i'm going to click on
82:13 - that link
82:15 - so here you need to select the styles
82:17 - that you want to use
82:18 - and i'm not going to use the italics so
82:20 - i'm going to select and start with the
82:22 - first one which is
82:23 - the regular 400 so i'm going to select
82:25 - it
82:26 - so once you select them they'll be
82:28 - displayed on this
82:30 - viewer and then you need to select the
82:32 - second one
82:33 - which is the medium 500 i'm going to
82:36 - select that style
82:38 - we have semiball 600 select
82:41 - we have the bold 700 i'm going to select
82:44 - that style
82:45 - we have the extra bold 800 select
82:49 - and finally i'm going to select the
82:50 - black 900
82:53 - so the next step now is to copy the code
82:57 - and paste it on the head section of all
83:00 - layouts
83:03 - so i'm going to copy
83:06 - and then on the html where we have the
83:09 - head section
83:12 - so paste
83:16 - and then from there let's go back to the
83:19 - google fonts and then you need to copy
83:22 - the rules so i'm going to copy that
83:26 - rule css rules to specify formulas
83:31 - and then on the typography
83:34 - we're going to paste it where we want to
83:36 - use that font family
83:38 - so we are going to paste on the display
83:41 - tool and then on the intro
83:45 - and then i'm going to save the two files
83:48 - check on the browser and
83:52 - there you have it so let's increase the
83:55 - font size
83:55 - of the description and also
83:58 - set the text transform to none on the
84:01 - description
84:07 - so here we need to increase the font
84:09 - size to 1.5
84:10 - and then set the text transform
84:19 - to none i'm going to save let's see
84:22 - and there you have it so for the text
84:26 - for the description we need to add
84:28 - a class for line height
84:34 - so here i'm going to add that class so
84:36 - we have lh
84:39 - base i'm going to use lhbs or
84:43 - lh
84:46 - large
84:49 - so let's see how la the large looks like
84:52 - so i'm going to save check on the
84:54 - browser
84:55 - so line height lag is a bit large so
84:58 - let's use
84:59 - line height base so i'm going to save
85:05 - so i think line height base is a bit
85:10 - better
85:13 - so i think we are done with that part so
85:16 - the next step now is to create
85:17 - the second column from the layout here
85:20 - you can see we have this illustration
85:22 - and this animated play button and once
85:25 - you click
85:26 - the animated button a video will pop up
85:27 - from youtube or any other source that
85:29 - you choose
85:30 - so let's work on that
85:34 - so i will start by copying this
85:36 - illustration to my project
85:38 - and here i have that illustration it's a
85:40 - png so i'm going to copy
85:42 - to my project so inside the images
85:46 - folder i'm going to create another
85:47 - folder called
85:48 - at
85:53 - so this way i'm going to keep all the
85:54 - illustrations
85:58 - and then paste
86:01 - so you can also get this illustration on
86:03 - this website called
86:05 - manypixels.co
86:07 - slash gallery so here you can search for
86:11 - that illustration you can also filter by
86:13 - categories types
86:14 - and also change the color so first let's
86:16 - change the color
86:18 - so here i'm going to use our one of the
86:20 - variables color
86:23 - and i'm going to use the purple light so
86:25 - i'm going to copy the x value
86:32 - copy and then here we need to change
86:35 - that value
86:37 - paste so before you search
86:41 - first make sure that you change the
86:42 - color and then here we're going to
86:44 - search for that illustration
86:45 - and just type coding
86:51 - so if you type that you'll be able to
86:52 - see that illustration and there it is
86:54 - so i'm going to click it so that i can
86:56 - be able to download you can either
86:57 - download it as a
86:58 - svg or a png so either way we'll work
87:06 - so once you do that then we can create
87:08 - that
87:10 - column or that content so inside the
87:13 - html
87:15 - so first you're going to start with the
87:16 - comment so we have this second column
87:19 - and i'm going to stay start
87:23 - the content for the video
87:30 - and then also for the first column
87:34 - start the content
87:38 - for the intro
87:46 - so here going to create a class called
87:48 - videobox
87:49 - which is going to keep all everything
87:53 - so we have videobox
88:00 - and then we have that image
88:05 - so we have the images folder
88:10 - and then ads and then
88:14 - intro section illustration.png
88:17 - and then we have the video illustration
88:27 - so we need also to add that glass for
88:30 - responsive images
88:35 - it's called image fluid
88:39 - so i'm going to save let's see from the
88:40 - browser
88:44 - and there you have it you can see now
88:46 - you have that illustration so let's push
88:48 - it to the
88:49 - right or to the end so here we're going
88:51 - to add a class called
88:53 - on the intros where you have that column
88:55 - you're going to add the text end class
88:58 - to push it to the end i'm going to save
89:02 - let's see and there you have it now you
89:05 - can see
89:06 - it's on the edge or the end so next
89:09 - let's add the play button
89:12 - so we're going to add the play button
89:13 - after the illustration
89:16 - and it will be inside the link so you
89:18 - have the link
89:22 - and then also inside the span
89:27 - so we have the icon and here we're going
89:29 - to use phonto some icons
89:31 - so we have the icon and then the class
89:33 - font or some solid
89:35 - and then the name of that icon is play
89:38 - circle
89:43 - so i'm going to save let's see from the
89:45 - browser
89:48 - so you can see this small icon here so
89:51 - we're going to style it
89:52 - so inside the intro section we're going
89:54 - to do the styling of that file
89:56 - and you're going to nest it the way
89:57 - we've done here on the html so we have
89:59 - the container for the content which is
90:00 - the intros
90:02 - and then we have the video box inside
90:03 - the intros we have the link
90:05 - inside the video box and then we have
90:07 - this pan inside the link and the icon
90:09 - inside the span so that's how you're
90:11 - going to do the nesting
90:13 - so on the intersection we're going to
90:16 - create that class
90:18 - so we have the intros as the container
90:20 - for the content
90:23 - and then we have the video box inside
90:25 - the intros
90:29 - and then we have the link inside the
90:32 - video box
90:33 - and then we have the span inside the
90:35 - link and then we have the icon
90:37 - inside the span
90:41 - so for the video box we are going to set
90:44 - the position to relative
90:51 - and then on the link you're going to set
90:55 - the position
90:56 - to absolute
91:04 - and then here we're going to set the
91:06 - font size on the
91:08 - icon and i'm going to use six ram
91:12 - you can change that later it's too small
91:14 - or too large and then
91:15 - the color i'm going to use a dark color
91:20 - but you're going to change it later so
91:21 - here we're going to use black
91:25 - so i'm going to save let's see there is
91:27 - also found the browser
91:30 - and there you have it you can see now we
91:32 - have that icon and that is not the
91:33 - position that you want
91:34 - to be so we need it at the center of the
91:36 - column or that the
91:39 - illustration so here we can use the
91:41 - bootstrap utilities
91:43 - for positioning that icon and
91:46 - in earlier version of bootstrap we only
91:47 - had a position static
91:49 - position relative position absolute
91:51 - position fixed position sticky
91:53 - in the new version now you can arrange
91:54 - your elements using these properties
91:56 - like the top
91:57 - for the vertical top position we have
91:59 - the stat for the horizontal left
92:00 - position in left to right
92:02 - we have the bottom for the vertical
92:04 - bottom position
92:05 - we have the end for the horizontal right
92:07 - position in left to right
92:09 - you can also just use these other values
92:12 - for the zero
92:13 - for zero edge position fifty for the
92:16 - fifty percentage position
92:18 - hundred four hundred percent edge
92:19 - position so you can see we have those
92:22 - properties here or the classes you can
92:24 - also
92:25 - center your elements using these new
92:27 - classes
92:28 - we have the translate middle and then
92:31 - you also have
92:33 - this applies to transformation translate
92:35 - x for the minus fifty percent and
92:37 - translate way for the minus
92:39 - 50 to the element which in combination
92:42 - with the edge positioning utilities
92:44 - allows you to absolute center and
92:46 - elements
92:47 - so you're going to be using some of
92:48 - these classes
92:50 - to position that icon but for now we
92:53 - need
92:54 - to write our own and here we're going to
92:56 - write it or create
92:57 - a mixing which are going to reuse this
92:59 - code
93:00 - so inside the makesense.css you're going
93:03 - to create that mixer
93:06 - so here is i'm going to start with the
93:08 - comment which is
93:09 - absolutes
93:13 - center
93:20 - so we have the at mixing
93:24 - and i'm going to call it absolute
93:28 - center
93:31 - so here going to set the position to
93:34 - absolute
93:40 - and then top 50
93:45 - 50 percent left also 50
93:54 - transform
93:57 - translate
94:00 - we have minus 50 percent
94:04 - and then minus 50 percent
94:08 - i'm going to save and then you're going
94:10 - to include this mixing
94:12 - on the link
94:15 - so i'm going to include that mixing
94:21 - absolute center so we have it here
94:26 - close and then i'm going to save so
94:29 - let's see from the browser
94:32 - and there you have it you can see now we
94:34 - have our icon at the center of that
94:36 - column so if you check from the layouts
94:40 - you can see now that is the position
94:43 - that our icon should be
94:45 - so let's change the color to reflect
94:47 - what we have on the layout so here we
94:49 - are going to use
94:50 - secondary
94:54 - save sorry we have the secondary
94:58 - save
95:02 - and there you have it you can see now we
95:04 - have that icon at the position that
95:06 - you want it so this mixing you can reuse
95:10 - it
95:10 - every time that you want to position
95:12 - something at the center that is position
95:14 - absolute
95:16 - so now let's use the bootstrap position
95:18 - utilities to position
95:20 - the icon so we're going to do it on the
95:22 - html
95:24 - so here on the link you're going to add
95:26 - the class
95:28 - and we're going to start with position
95:31 - absolute that is the class
95:39 - and then top 50.
95:42 - and then start 50.
95:50 - and then you need center to center the
95:52 - elements or the icon
95:54 - and you're going to use translate middle
95:59 - so we have it here i'm going to save and
96:03 - then where we have that
96:05 - position absolute you're going to remove
96:07 - it or just comment it
96:11 - so i'm going to save so let's see from
96:15 - the browser
96:17 - and as you can see our icon is still
96:19 - intact at the position that
96:20 - it was previously so next up we are
96:24 - going to create the background wave
96:26 - so from the layout here you can see we
96:27 - have this background wave at the bottom
96:28 - of that
96:29 - section so you're going to do this from
96:31 - the help of
96:32 - this website called getwaves.io
96:36 - so here you're going to make sure that
96:37 - we generate something close or something
96:38 - similar
96:39 - like what we have here on the layouts
96:43 - so you can use these two buttons to
96:44 - change the direction of the
96:46 - wave we have the one facing at the top
96:49 - and the one facing at the bottom
96:52 - here you can change the color and here
96:54 - you can play around with this button to
96:55 - generate random waves till you find the
96:57 - one
96:58 - that you want to use so we're going to
97:01 - change the direction facing the app
97:03 - and then i'm going to do play around
97:05 - with this but until i find the one close
97:07 - or similar to the one we have used here
97:09 - on the layout
97:11 - so i'm going to use this one i'm going
97:13 - to click to get the code
97:16 - so copy svg code
97:19 - and then on the html at the bottom of
97:21 - that section
97:24 - i'm going to paste
97:35 - and then i'm going to change this color
97:37 - from blue to white
97:40 - so hex value for white is fff
97:44 - or 6f and then i'm going to save
97:48 - check on the browser
97:52 - and there you have it now we have that
97:54 - background wave
97:57 - so the next step now is to animate this
97:59 - icon from the layout
98:00 - you can see the play button is animated
98:03 - so let's work on that
98:07 - so on the intro section we're going to
98:09 - create a class called
98:10 - border animation
98:18 - so here you're going to set the position
98:20 - to obsolete
98:24 - obsolete
98:28 - and then you're going to set the width
98:30 - and the height and you're going to use
98:31 - the same size we used
98:33 - on the fonts on that icon sorry which is
98:35 - six ram
98:37 - so we have the width
98:43 - we have 6 ram same with height
98:51 - 6 ram
98:58 - then we need the border
99:02 - we're going to start with the width
99:03 - which i'm going to set to 0.55
99:06 - frame solid
99:11 - color i'm going to use white
99:17 - so i'm going to save and then you're
99:18 - going to add this class
99:20 - to the html where we want that
99:24 - border to be so
99:27 - i'm going to create a span with a class
99:29 - of border animation class
99:36 - so i'm going to save let's see from the
99:38 - browser
99:44 - so you can see this border
99:47 - so let me change the color to be able to
99:49 - see it properly
99:51 - so i'm going to change from white to
99:53 - black
99:56 - save let's see
100:00 - so you can see this border so we need to
100:02 - change the color
100:03 - sorry we need to make it round so we
100:06 - need to change the border radius or set
100:08 - the border radius to
100:09 - 50 percent
100:16 - so we have border radius
100:22 - 50
100:25 - save let's see
100:28 - and there you have it so the next thing
100:32 - now is to position it to where we have
100:33 - this icon
100:35 - because it must be in that position same
100:37 - position with the icon
100:38 - so that can be able to animate position
100:41 - that you're going to set
100:42 - the top position to zero and also the
100:44 - left position to zero
100:48 - so we have left
100:52 - zero so i'm going to save
100:57 - let's see from the browser
101:01 - and there you have it now it is at the
101:02 - position where we have that icon
101:08 - so next i'm going to create an animation
101:10 - which is going to animate
101:11 - that border so inside the animations.css
101:14 - we're going to create an animation
101:16 - called pulse so i'm going to start with
101:18 - the comment which is
101:19 - pulse border
101:24 - so here we have the keyframes
101:29 - and i'm going to call it pulse
101:32 - border
101:36 - so from zero percent we are going to
101:39 - scale it
101:41 - from one so we have
101:44 - transform and then scale it one
101:48 - scale it one
101:53 - and then two hundred percent we're going
101:54 - to scale it to 1.5
102:00 - so we have
102:03 - scale 1.5
102:09 - then you're going to add this animation
102:12 - to our animation border class
102:16 - so animation name
102:21 - we have that pulse border
102:26 - it's going to last for one second linear
102:30 - infinite
102:32 - so you have linear infinite
102:36 - so i'm going to save let's see
102:40 - from the browser so you can see now
102:43 - animation is already working
102:47 - so we're going to create two animations
102:49 - so here on the html we're going to
102:54 - duplicate
102:57 - and then here going to modify that
102:58 - animation
103:03 - so we have the first border minus minus
103:06 - border one
103:10 - so here you're going to set the two
103:11 - borders with a different animation delay
103:15 - so we have animation delay for the first
103:16 - border
103:20 - which is going to last for one second
103:24 - and then for the second border
103:27 - minus minus border two
103:35 - animation delay
103:38 - so you have this animation delay 1.2
103:41 - seconds
103:43 - so even this one should be animation
103:44 - delay not animation
103:48 - animation delay
103:52 - so i'm going to save then on the html we
103:54 - need to nest it there we have done
103:57 - so here we're going to add for the first
104:00 - one we have
104:01 - border animation minus minus
104:05 - border one
104:13 - so i'm going to copy that to the second
104:16 - border
104:19 - so this one should be border two so i'm
104:21 - going to save let's see from the browser
104:25 - so we can't be able to see the border so
104:27 - what you're going to do here on the
104:28 - animation you're going to set the
104:29 - opacity
104:30 - for the first from zero
104:34 - we're going to set the opacity to one
104:36 - and then on the hundred percent we're
104:37 - going to set
104:38 - opacity to zero so you have opacity
104:46 - one
104:48 - i'm going to copy
104:51 - and then this one will be 0 200
104:55 - so i'm going to save let's see
104:58 - so now you can see we have the two
105:00 - borders so we need to change the delay
105:02 - animation delay so here on the intro
105:05 - section we need to change
105:06 - from 1.2 to 1.5
105:10 - and then also this one should last for
105:12 - 1.5
105:13 - so i'm going to save let's see
105:20 - and there you have it you can see now
105:21 - the two borders so let's change the
105:23 - color
105:24 - to white on the border
105:30 - save let's see
105:33 - and now as you can see that is our
105:35 - animation
105:38 - so if you check from the layout
105:41 - you can see we have achieved the same
105:43 - results
105:48 - and i think we are done with that part
105:52 - so the next thing is to create the video
105:54 - pop-up you can see from the layout
105:56 - once you click this animated play button
105:58 - a video will pop up from youtube or any
106:00 - other source that you choose
106:01 - it can even be a self-hosted video
106:04 - so to create that you're going to use a
106:06 - free javascript lightbox called
106:08 - g lightbox from brt digital
106:11 - so you can go to github and search for
106:13 - this brt digital or just
106:14 - g lightbox alternatively you can also go
106:17 - to
106:18 - npmjs and search for that package called
106:20 - g lightbox
106:22 - so here you see it says deletebox is a
106:24 - pure javascript lightbox
106:26 - it can display images iframes inline
106:29 - contents and videos with optional
106:30 - autoplay for youtube
106:32 - vimeo and even self hosted videos so you
106:34 - can see it has some good features
106:36 - it's fast and responsive that means it
106:38 - can work with any screen
106:40 - size we have the gallery support you can
106:42 - create multiple galleries
106:44 - we have video support for youtube vimeo
106:46 - and self-hosted videos with autoplay
106:49 - we have support for inline content
106:50 - iframe support keyboard navigation
106:53 - touch navigation zoomable images api
106:56 - that means you can control the light box
106:57 - with the provided methods
106:59 - and also it's dimmable that means you
107:01 - can create your skin or modify the
107:03 - animation
107:04 - with some minor css changes then on the
107:06 - usage we have different ways of using
107:08 - this
107:08 - lightbox you can install it using npm
107:11 - and you can also
107:12 - manually download the source files and
107:14 - then link the javascript in your html
107:17 - so i'm going to go with the second
107:18 - option that is to download the source
107:19 - files and then i'm going to link the
107:21 - javascript
107:22 - and the style sheet in my html i have
107:24 - downloaded the source files so i'm just
107:26 - going to copy the source files to my
107:28 - projects
107:29 - so here we have this folder called g
107:31 - lightbox master and this is the folder
107:32 - which has all the source files
107:34 - so inside that folder we have another
107:36 - folder called list
107:38 - and this is the folder which has the
107:39 - files that you're going to use
107:41 - so if you open that file you'll see we
107:42 - have the css folder
107:44 - which has the style sheet and we have
107:46 - the two versions
107:48 - and then also we have the js folder
107:49 - which has the javascript and again we
107:51 - have the two versions
107:53 - so i'm just going to copy the two
107:54 - folders to my projects
107:56 - so copy and then inside my projects
108:00 - so i'm going to keep them inside the
108:02 - assets folder
108:03 - and then inside their search folder i'm
108:05 - going to create another folder
108:08 - and i'm going to call it vendors so here
108:10 - i'm going to keep all the
108:13 - source files for vendors so we have
108:16 - vendors
108:21 - then inside that folder i'm going to
108:23 - paste
108:26 - so then from there now we're going to
108:27 - link the two files
108:29 - to the on the html so let's start with
108:32 - the javascripts
108:33 - and they're going to link link it at the
108:35 - bottom
108:37 - so here we have the scripts
108:42 - and then we have the source
108:46 - so we have the assets folder
108:49 - and then vendors and then js
108:54 - so you can use any of the two options
108:57 - i'm going to use the minified version
109:00 - and then we need also to link the style
109:02 - sheets
109:03 - on the head section
109:10 - so we have link and then we have the
109:13 - assets folder
109:16 - vendor and then css
109:20 - and again i'm going to use the minified
109:22 - version
109:24 - then from there we're going to set the
109:25 - lightbox options for the video
109:28 - you can see here we have the light box
109:29 - options and we have the options for the
109:32 - image
109:33 - and you can see the type is an image and
109:35 - then we have the options for the video
109:37 - and you can see the type is a video so
109:39 - here we have the link
109:40 - which is an option you need to set the
109:43 - link
109:44 - and then you have the type whether it's
109:46 - an image or video and then the source
109:48 - here you need to specify the source
109:50 - either from youtube female or
109:51 - self-hosted video
109:53 - and then we have the width you can also
109:54 - set the autoplay videos to true
109:57 - first you need to declare using the
109:58 - const keyword so i'm going to copy
110:00 - that declaration
110:04 - and then at the bottom we need to create
110:06 - another script
110:07 - immediately below the lightbox
110:10 - javascript
110:12 - so we have the script and the type
110:16 - is text
110:22 - javascript
110:29 - and then i'm going to paste so here you
110:32 - need to remove the
110:33 - touch navigation loop and the auto play
110:35 - videos
110:36 - and then you're going to replace that
110:37 - with the options that we have
110:39 - for the video so i'm going to copy
110:44 - just to save time
110:47 - and then we need to replace
110:50 - the link for the video
110:54 - so here i'm going to copy from one of my
110:56 - videos i have on youtube
110:59 - so you have two options you can either
111:00 - copy the url of the video
111:04 - or just click on this link that says
111:06 - here
111:08 - then you can copy the link
111:11 - so i'm going to replace that
111:16 - and then paste and then from there we
111:18 - need to add
111:20 - the g lightbox class where we have that
111:21 - animated play button
111:24 - so we have g lightbox
111:29 - so you need to add that class and then
111:31 - i'm going to save
111:32 - so let's see from the browser
111:38 - so now if you click the animated play
111:40 - button you'll be able to see
111:42 - the pop-up from youtube
111:46 - so you can see now we have that pop-up
111:48 - from youtube so here remember you can
111:50 - also set
111:51 - the auto play videos to true
111:54 - so you need to add that option so we
111:57 - have auto play
112:01 - videos
112:07 - we have true and then i'm going to save
112:10 - let's see again
112:13 - so now if you click again you'll be able
112:14 - to see the autoplay videos working
112:20 - and there you have it so in this video
112:22 - we're going to build a mod
112:25 - and the good thing about that lightbox
112:27 - you can see it's fully responsive and
112:29 - this one is a screen
112:31 - device with a screen window 316 you can
112:34 - see
112:35 - it's fully responsive so i'm going to
112:36 - switch to another device like a medium
112:37 - device
112:40 - and again you can see our our light box
112:44 - or the pop-up is fully responsive
112:48 - so with that we are
112:52 - so with that we are done with that part
112:55 - so the next thing nice to make sure that
112:57 - our section is fully responsive across
112:59 - variety of screen devices
113:00 - and to do that i'm going to right click
113:02 - and inspect elements
113:05 - so before you write any media query or
113:07 - do anything we're going to see how our
113:08 - sections look like
113:09 - on various devices so this one is moto
113:12 - g4
113:13 - it's a device with a screen window of
113:14 - 360.
113:16 - and the content is not bad so here we
113:19 - can decrease the font size a bit for the
113:20 - description
113:21 - so let's see from another device like
113:23 - pixel 2. here the content is not that
113:27 - bad
113:28 - what about iphone x
113:32 - not good ipad
113:37 - not good
113:41 - so what about surface duo
113:45 - not bad
113:48 - iphone 678 plus
113:52 - i think not bad but here we can
113:56 - decrease the font size of the
113:57 - description a bit
114:00 - so to make this work we are going to
114:01 - [Music]
114:03 - on the typography where we have the
114:04 - description we are going to decrease the
114:06 - font size for small devices
114:08 - that is any device with the screen width
114:10 - of 600 and below
114:12 - we're going to set the font size or
114:13 - decrease the font size
114:17 - so here we're going to focus first on
114:21 - mobile devices so we're going to set the
114:23 - font size to
114:24 - one ram and then here i'm going to write
114:28 - a media query which is going to target
114:30 - large devices so we have
114:32 - that mixing so include media breakpoint
114:46 - up so from large
114:50 - so you have to use those initials lg for
114:52 - large devices
114:54 - and then we are going to set the font
114:56 - size
115:00 - to 1.5 frame
115:04 - also we're going to set the
115:08 - display to inline block
115:12 - so here the display
115:15 - we're going to set that to inline block
115:24 - so i'm going to save and look at the
115:27 - content again
115:30 - so now you can see on this device which
115:33 - is an iphone 6 plus
115:35 - the description is a bit small and that
115:37 - is what i wanted
115:39 - so let's see from another device like
115:41 - moto g4
115:42 - still the same so what about an ipad
115:48 - as you can see the section is
115:51 - good on that device
115:55 - so let's see from an ipad pro
115:58 - and there you can see now the font size
116:00 - of that description is a bit big
116:05 - so it can even decrease to 1.4 m so let
116:08 - me decrease to 1.4
116:13 - save let's see
116:17 - yeah now you can see the content is not
116:18 - bad perfect
116:21 - so let me go back to moto g4
116:26 - perfect
116:29 - pixel 2 perfect
116:34 - surface duo perfect
116:43 - iphone 5s e i think
116:46 - we need to target i think it's all bad
116:52 - so with that i think our section is
116:55 - fully
116:56 - responsive and we can move on
117:02 - welcome back in this video we are going
117:04 - to create section 3 of
117:05 - our layout which is the companies so
117:08 - let's get started and create something
117:09 - similar like what we have here on the
117:10 - layout
117:11 - so on the html we're going to start that
117:13 - section
117:17 - so i'm going to start with a comment
117:20 - start
117:21 - the companies
117:31 - so here we have that section with a
117:33 - class with an id of
117:36 - companies and a class of
117:39 - companies
117:42 - it will have a container
117:50 - and a row
117:58 - so here we're going to start with that
118:00 - heading we have trusted by companies
118:02 - like
118:03 - so i'm going to copy
118:10 - so here we have h4 with a class of
118:14 - font-weight bold and a glass of lead
118:19 - and some margin so i'm going to use mp3
118:23 - margin bottom three
118:26 - and then the text
118:31 - tab and there you have it so i'm going
118:35 - to save
118:37 - so let's see from the browser result so
118:39 - far
118:41 - so this is our text so we need it at the
118:43 - center so i'm going to add
118:45 - on the row text center class
118:51 - so we have the text center
118:56 - save let's see
118:59 - and there you have it you can see we
119:00 - have our text at the center
119:03 - next i'm going to add the heading line
119:05 - from the layout here you can see we have
119:07 - a line below the heading or the display
119:09 - and actually these are two lines so we
119:11 - have the first line which is content
119:12 - before
119:13 - and the second line which is content
119:15 - after so let's work on that
119:17 - so on typography i'm going to add that
119:21 - class first i'm going to start with a
119:23 - comment which is
119:24 - heading line
119:29 - the class i'm going to call it heading
119:32 - line so this one is for the first line
119:35 - so we have content before
119:40 - and then we have the contents
119:46 - and then i'm going to set the width
119:50 - for the first line to 10 ram
119:54 - and then the height i'm going to set
119:56 - that to
119:58 - 0.1 ram
120:02 - then i'm going to set the display
120:06 - to block
120:10 - then some background color
120:16 - i'm going to use primary
120:20 - and then i'm going to duplicate this
120:21 - class for the content after
120:25 - so duplicate and then here we need after
120:30 - so this one is for the second line or
120:32 - the line below the first line
120:35 - so i'm going to save and then you're
120:37 - going to add that class
120:39 - below the heading
120:46 - and then i'm going to save let's see
120:47 - from the browser
120:51 - so we have the lines let me add some
120:53 - margins so that you can be able to see
120:54 - it properly so we have
120:56 - margin bottom five
120:59 - save let's see so now you can see we
121:03 - have our first line
121:04 - so because they are having the same
121:06 - width so i'm going to change for the
121:08 - second
121:10 - which i'm going to set to to ram
121:14 - and then for the width height i'm going
121:16 - to set that to 0.2
121:18 - save let's see
121:21 - and now you can see we have the line the
121:23 - first one and the second one
121:25 - so here we need to set some margin
121:31 - so for the second line i'm going to set
121:34 - some padding at the top
121:35 - so we have padding top i'm going to use
121:38 - 0.5
121:39 - ram and then i'm going to save
121:43 - let's see so now you can see we have the
121:47 - two lines
121:48 - the second one is a bit has a higher
121:51 - height than the
121:52 - first one so we need them at the center
121:54 - so here we're going to add
121:57 - so i'm going to select the two and then
122:00 - add the margin
122:03 - that is set the margin to zero outer
122:07 - for horizontal centering
122:10 - and then i'm going to save let's see
122:14 - and there you have it now you can see we
122:15 - have our line at the center
122:21 - so for the second line i'm going to add
122:23 - some margin at the bottom
122:24 - margin bottom to one rem
122:28 - save let's see
122:32 - and there you have it next i'm going to
122:34 - add
122:35 - the images or these logos to my project
122:38 - so we have the six
122:39 - logos so here i have a folder called
122:41 - companies you can see
122:43 - the logos are named company one all the
122:44 - way to company six so i'm going to copy
122:46 - the entire folder to my project
122:48 - so copy
122:51 - so i'm going to copy them inside the
122:52 - images folder
122:55 - so on the html you're going to create
122:57 - that content and i'm going to create
122:59 - another container so here we're going to
123:01 - start with a comment which is start
123:03 - the company's
123:12 - content
123:15 - so we have a container class
123:19 - which will have a row
123:23 - and then i'm going to create the six
123:24 - columns which will have the
123:26 - logos so here i'm going to group them
123:30 - so i'm going to use call md4
123:35 - and then another class or another
123:37 - container for the logos
123:38 - i'm going to call it companies then i'm
123:42 - going to use
123:42 - block element modifier to style that
123:46 - logos so we have the companies and then
123:48 - underscore underscore
123:50 - logo box
123:54 - then we need the images so we have the
123:57 - image
124:00 - and then the source of the images we
124:02 - have
124:05 - the images folder
124:08 - and then the companies folder which have
124:10 - the logos
124:13 - so if you check here again from the
124:15 - folder you'll see the company
124:17 - logos are named company one all the way
124:19 - to company six and they are in png
124:23 - so here we have to write that
124:26 - company minus dollar sign to assign each
124:30 - value
124:31 - and then dot png
124:35 - then we need an alt which will be
124:44 - company dollar sign logo
124:49 - then we need the title
124:53 - so the title will be company again
124:56 - dollar sign logo
125:01 - then we need a class called image fluid
125:04 - for responsive images
125:05 - so we have image fluid
125:10 - so here i'm going to say time 6 to
125:12 - generate the six columns with the
125:14 - content at once
125:15 - hit tab and there you have it you can
125:18 - see now we have
125:19 - the six columns with the contents
125:22 - so let me arrange them properly here
125:26 - and then i'm going to save let's see
125:28 - from the browser
125:31 - so now we have our logos the next step
125:34 - now is to style them
125:36 - so inside the companies.css file that is
125:39 - the sas file for that section so i'm
125:40 - going to open that and you're going to
125:42 - start by styling
125:44 - this class called companies because this
125:46 - is the container for the content
125:48 - on that section
125:51 - so we have the class
125:54 - companies so here i'm going to start by
125:58 - setting the padding
126:02 - sorry not padding top but padding you're
126:04 - going to use the shorthand
126:07 - for the top zero and then
126:12 - zero and then for the bottom you're
126:13 - going to set that to five frame
126:15 - and then zero for the left
126:19 - and then here we have the companies
126:22 - sorry
126:23 - we have this class remember how we have
126:26 - nested them we have the companies and
126:28 - then underscore underscore logo box
126:30 - so that's how you're going to nest it so
126:33 - we have
126:35 - my underscore underscore logo box
126:42 - because the logo box is the parent
126:44 - container of all the logos
126:46 - that is the images you can see here we
126:48 - have the logo box and then the images
126:51 - so here going to set the width so we
126:55 - have we are going to use max width
127:00 - we're going to set that 200 percent
127:06 - then we're going to set the height
127:09 - so here i'm going to use three ram you
127:12 - can change that
127:14 - then you're going to style the image
127:18 - so here again only to set the height so
127:20 - that it can scale to 3 ram so i'm going
127:22 - to set the height 200 percents
127:27 - so i'm going to save let's see from the
127:29 - browser
127:32 - and there you have it you can see now we
127:34 - have the images of scaled
127:36 - to the window of the column and the
127:38 - height of that
127:40 - which is rhythm so
127:43 - let's continue styling here so here i'm
127:45 - going to add some margin
127:47 - at the bottom
127:50 - i'm going to use two ram and then we
127:53 - need some padding
127:57 - i'm going to use 0.5 ram
128:02 - and then we have text align
128:06 - center and then not forgetting you to
128:10 - set the position to relative
128:16 - i'm going to save let's say from the
128:18 - browser
128:19 - and there you have it now you can see
128:21 - they have scaled so we need to add some
128:22 - shadow on the columns
128:24 - you can see from the layout here we need
128:26 - some shadow
128:30 - so on the html i'm going to select all
128:32 - the classes
128:33 - the logo box
128:37 - and then i'm going to add the shadow
128:38 - small so we have that glass
128:41 - shadow small
128:45 - so i'm going to save let's see
128:49 - and now as you can see we have the
128:51 - shadow
128:52 - so the next step knows to make sure that
128:54 - our section is fully responsive across
128:56 - variety of screen devices
128:58 - so i'm going to right click and inspect
129:00 - elements
129:02 - so you can see this one is moto g4 a
129:05 - screen window of 360 and
129:07 - the logos are screen scaling and fitting
129:09 - nicely in one column
129:11 - so i'm going to check it from another
129:13 - device like an ipad
129:16 - and you can see these are an ipad a
129:18 - screen window of 768
129:20 - and they're fitting nicely in three
129:22 - columns
129:24 - so i'm going to check it from another
129:25 - device larger than that
129:27 - so we have ipad pro and you can see
129:30 - also they are fitting nicely but here we
129:33 - have so much space that they can fit in
129:35 - one
129:36 - line so to fix that i'm going to
129:39 - add another color for target large
129:41 - devices so i'm going to select all the
129:43 - columns
129:44 - or the classes
129:48 - and then i'm going to add that class or
129:50 - that column that is called
129:53 - lg2 so i'm going to save
129:58 - save let's see
130:01 - so now they are fitting in one line so
130:04 - i'm going to
130:06 - change their screen width
130:11 - and here you can see again they're
130:12 - fitting in nicely in
130:14 - one line so i'm going to close the
130:16 - inspector
130:19 - and as you can see we have the logos
130:21 - fitting nicely in one
130:23 - line as we what we have here on the
130:25 - layout
130:26 - so the next thing is to make sure that
130:28 - once you hover the logos they turn to
130:30 - grayscale
130:33 - so let's create that hover effect so on
130:36 - the companies where we have
130:38 - the image
130:45 - we have the hoover
130:49 - so we have the filter
130:52 - property and then grayscale so i'm going
130:55 - to set that to 120
130:57 - save let's see so now if you try to
131:00 - hover the
131:01 - logos you see they're turning to
131:03 - grayscale
131:06 - so i think we're done with that part we
131:08 - can move on to the next step
131:13 - welcome back in this video we are going
131:14 - to create section 4 of the layout
131:16 - which is the services or our services so
131:19 - let's get started and make sure that we
131:20 - create something similar like what you
131:22 - have here on the layout
131:24 - so on the html i'm going to start that
131:26 - section
131:27 - first i'm going to start with a comment
131:29 - which is start
131:34 - section 4.
131:38 - the services
131:44 - so we have the section with an id of
131:48 - services and a class of
131:53 - our services
131:56 - which will have the container
132:01 - and the row so i'm going to hit tab
132:06 - so we are going to start with that
132:08 - heading so we have the
132:10 - our services and then this heading line
132:14 - copy so this one is h1
132:19 - with a class of display 3
132:26 - and a class of font-weight bold
132:33 - so i'm going to tab i'm going to save
132:37 - then we need that heading line so we
132:39 - have the class
132:42 - heading line and some margin at the
132:46 - bottom
132:46 - so mb5 so i'm going to save let's see
132:54 - so we have the heading so we need it at
132:56 - the center so here we're going to add
132:58 - the
132:58 - text center class so we have the text
133:02 - center i'm going to save let's see
133:08 - and there you have it
133:12 - so next we are going to create the font
133:13 - style of this heading so
133:15 - we're going to do the same way we did
133:16 - with display 2 on the introduction
133:20 - so we're going to add that font family
133:21 - called poppins
133:24 - so on typography we're going to create
133:26 - that
133:27 - display 3. so first is a comment which
133:30 - is
133:31 - display three
133:35 - and then you have that class display
133:38 - three
133:40 - so here i'm going to copy the font
133:41 - family from display too
133:47 - so copy and then you're going to paste
133:52 - save let's see
133:55 - and there you have it you can see now
133:58 - the heading
133:59 - is using that font family called poppins
134:04 - next we are going to create the two
134:06 - columns which have the two description
134:09 - and the border at the center so let's
134:11 - work on that
134:13 - so here i'm going to create another
134:16 - container
134:16 - for that content
134:22 - so i'm going to start with a comment
134:24 - which is start
134:26 - the description content
134:34 - so you have a container class
134:37 - [Music]
134:38 - which will have a row and the row will
134:42 - have
134:42 - some padding at the top so i'm going to
134:44 - use padding top
134:46 - three sorry two and some padding at the
134:49 - bottom
134:50 - so we have padding bottom two
134:53 - and then some margin at the top five
134:57 - and then some margin at the bottom so m
134:59 - b
135:00 - three and then we need the two columns
135:04 - so i'm going to
135:06 - group them so i'm going to use
135:10 - call md6
135:14 - and then i'm going to say times two to
135:16 - create the two at once hit tab
135:23 - so i'm going to start with the
135:24 - description for the first column
135:26 - so here we have a class called bg white
135:31 - and some padding so i'm going to use p3
135:34 - tab and then h2
135:38 - with a class of font-weight bold
135:42 - and a class of text capitalize
135:48 - and the class of text center
135:55 - so i'm going to copy the text from the
136:02 - layouts
136:05 - copy paste
136:10 - then for the second column the
136:11 - description for the second column
136:13 - again we have bg
136:16 - white and a class of
136:20 - some padding so we're going to use b4
136:24 - and then a class of text
136:28 - stats to align it at the left
136:34 - then you're going to create a paragraph
136:35 - with a class of font-weight lights
136:40 - and a class of
136:45 - text stats but you already have it on
136:48 - the bg head so i'm going to
136:50 - hit tab and then i'm going to copy that
136:53 - text from the layout
137:01 - paste
137:08 - i'm going to save let's see from the
137:09 - browser
137:12 - so there we have now our two description
137:15 - so the next thing now is to add this
137:17 - border at the center
137:18 - of the two columns so here i'm going to
137:20 - create a class called boulder right
137:22 - so in the first column i'm going to add
137:24 - that class which you're going to style
137:26 - it
137:27 - we have border right
137:30 - and then inside the typography we're
137:32 - going to style it
137:35 - let's start with the comment which is
137:38 - border right
137:42 - and then the class is buddha rights
137:48 - so we have that property boda right and
137:56 - i'm going to set
137:57 - the width to 0.1 ram
138:00 - solid and i'm going to use
138:04 - gray 300.
138:10 - and then here i'm going to set the
138:12 - height to 100
138:17 - so we have the height 100 percent
138:22 - so i'm going to save let's see from the
138:24 - browser
138:26 - and there you have it you can see now we
138:28 - have that border at the center of the
138:30 - two
138:30 - description next i'm going to create the
138:33 - three content for the services
138:35 - so from the layout here we have
138:36 - marketing web development
138:39 - and cloud hosting so for each service we
138:41 - have an icon
138:42 - heading text button and then an
138:44 - illustration same way with the second
138:46 - and the third one so let's work on that
138:52 - so here i'm going to start another
138:53 - container for that content
138:56 - so first you're going to start with the
138:58 - comment which is start
139:00 - the content
139:03 - for the services
139:13 - so here you're going to generate the
139:14 - three sections at once
139:16 - using emits so you can see here from the
139:18 - layout you have the two sections we have
139:20 - the first
139:21 - section which are the content and then
139:22 - on the right we have an illustration
139:24 - same way with the second and the dad
139:29 - so here we have a container
139:34 - and then we have a row so i'm going to
139:36 - group it
139:38 - the row will have two columns each so
139:40 - i'm going again to group them
139:42 - so we have for large devices you're
139:44 - going to use
139:46 - call lg6 and then for medium devices
139:50 - we're going to use
139:51 - call md6
139:57 - and then for small devices you're going
140:00 - to use call
140:04 - small 12 and then
140:08 - for extra small you're going to use
140:12 - call extra small 12
140:15 - and then we needed another container for
140:17 - the content
140:18 - so i'm going to call it services
140:23 - then we need margin at the top so i'm
140:25 - going to use margin top 4
140:29 - then from there we need now the
140:31 - container for the content that is the
140:33 - text
140:34 - so we have i'm going to call it services
140:38 - here we're going to use block element
140:39 - modifier underscore underscore
140:42 - contents so for the columns i'm going to
140:46 - say times two
140:47 - so that we have two columns for each row
140:50 - and then you're going to create the
140:53 - three rows
140:54 - or the three sections so i'm going to
140:55 - say times three
140:57 - so that means for each row we'll have
140:59 - two columns each
141:00 - so i'm going to hit tab and then it's
141:02 - going to generate for us all the three
141:04 - sections
141:06 - so you can see now we have the first row
141:09 - having the two columns
141:11 - the second row having the two columns
141:13 - for web development
141:15 - and then the that row or the that
141:17 - section having the two columns for cloud
141:19 - hosting
141:20 - so i'm going to comment them so that we
141:22 - can know where they start
141:24 - so we have start
141:28 - the marketing content
141:33 - tab so we have the second one
141:38 - so start the web development content
141:47 - and then finally the that one which is
141:50 - start
141:51 - the cloud hosting
141:56 - content
142:02 - so i'm going to start with the content
142:04 - for marketing and we have that content
142:06 - on the first column
142:08 - so here i'm going to add the content and
142:09 - then i'm going to style it later
142:12 - so we have the icon and then the heading
142:15 - and then the text and then this button
142:17 - and then on the second column we have
142:19 - this illustration
142:21 - so let's work on that so here i'm going
142:23 - to create a class called icon which is
142:24 - going to style
142:25 - that icon and then you're going to add
142:28 - that icon
142:29 - so we have the font or some solid class
142:31 - and then the name of that icon
142:33 - is paper plane
142:38 - tab then the second item is the heading
142:42 - so we have h3 with a class of display
142:45 - three
142:46 - so here i'm going to use block element
142:48 - modifier to style it so we have display
142:50 - three
142:51 - and and then minus minus title
142:56 - then i'm going to add some margin at the
142:58 - top so we have margin top one
143:01 - tab and then the heading is marketing
143:08 - that item is the text so we are going to
143:10 - have a paragraph with a class of line
143:12 - height
143:13 - large
143:17 - so here going to add some dummy text so
143:19 - we have lorem
143:21 - 28
143:29 - then you we have the button so here
143:32 - you're going to copy
143:33 - the button from the intro section
143:36 - so i'm going to scroll up and then copy
143:39 - the button
143:46 - so we have and then here i'm going to
143:50 - change
143:50 - the text to learn more
143:57 - so i'm going to save let's see how it
143:58 - looks like on the browser so far
144:02 - so this is our content so here going to
144:05 - add the border primary
144:06 - to the button so i'm going to add that
144:08 - class
144:09 - so we have border primary
144:14 - save let's see and there you have it
144:18 - so now we can go ahead and copy this
144:20 - content to the rest of the two sections
144:23 - so i'm going to copy the icon the
144:25 - heading the paragraph
144:27 - and the button
144:31 - so for the second column which is web
144:33 - development we have that content on the
144:35 - second
144:35 - column so i'm going to paste it on the
144:37 - second column
144:39 - and then for cloud hosting we have that
144:40 - content on the first column
144:43 - paste then i'm going to change the
144:46 - heading to cloud hosting
144:51 - and then also change the icon so that
144:54 - icon is called
144:56 - cloud
145:00 - upload alt
145:03 - and then we have web development
145:09 - and also going to change the icon to
145:11 - code
145:15 - so i'm going to save
145:18 - so let's see from the browser and these
145:20 - are our content looks like
145:22 - so we have marketing that is the content
145:25 - for marketing
145:26 - web development and cloud hosting
145:29 - next i'm going to add the illustrations
145:31 - and they already have them
145:32 - so i have a folder called services which
145:34 - has the three illustrations in png
145:37 - so i'm just going to copy the entire
145:38 - folder to my project
145:43 - so inside the services i'm going to
145:44 - paste
145:47 - so now we can go ahead now and add the
145:50 - illustrations so let's start with the
145:51 - marketing
145:53 - so for the first row we have the
145:56 - illustration on the second column
145:58 - so here we have an image with a class of
146:01 - image fluid
146:04 - and then we have an alt
146:08 - we have marketing
146:12 - illustration
146:18 - tab so we have the
146:21 - images folder which is the source
146:25 - and then the services and then service
146:28 - one dot png
146:29 - that is for marketing so i'm just going
146:32 - to copy this
146:36 - to web development so that we have the
146:39 - illustration on the first column
146:41 - paste and then you're going to change
146:45 - the value to service to
146:48 - and then change also the alt to web
146:51 - development
146:58 - i'll do the same to the third one which
147:00 - is cloud hosting so we have it on the
147:02 - second
147:03 - column
147:06 - paste change the value to service 3
147:11 - and also the alt which is cloud hosting
147:16 - illustration so i'm going to save let's
147:18 - see from the browser
147:21 - and there you have it now we have the
147:23 - three illustrations
147:28 - so the next step now is to style the
147:30 - content and you're going to do that on
147:31 - the sas file for that section which is
147:33 - the services.css
147:37 - so here i'm going to start with the
147:38 - container for the content which is the
147:40 - services class
147:44 - and then we need to do some correction
147:46 - on the html so at the beginning of that
147:48 - section
147:48 - we created a class called our services
147:51 - so let's rename that to just
147:52 - services
147:56 - and then save so
147:59 - on this container we're going to set to
148:00 - start by setting the
148:02 - position to relative
148:06 - and then some padding
148:10 - i'm going to use the shorthand top and
148:12 - bottom you're going to use one ram
148:14 - and then for left and right zero
148:18 - and then you're going to nested the web
148:19 - done on the html
148:21 - so we have this class called services
148:24 - underscore underscore content
148:27 - and then we have the icon inside the
148:30 - content
148:33 - so that's how we're going to nest it so
148:35 - we have
148:36 - underscore underscore content inside the
148:38 - services
148:41 - so here again we're going to save the
148:43 - padding for the contents
148:46 - to one ram all sides
148:50 - then some margin at the top
148:54 - i'm going to use 1.5 ram
148:59 - and then we need to style the icon so we
149:02 - have that icon class inside the content
149:06 - so for the font size we're going to set
149:08 - that to
149:10 - 2.5 ram you can change that letter if
149:13 - it's too
149:14 - big or too small and then the color
149:19 - we have primary
149:24 - so i'm going to save and then we need to
149:26 - use the module
149:27 - at the top so we have the use at rule
149:34 - and then custom so use it as
149:38 - star
149:42 - save let's see from the browser result
149:44 - so far
149:46 - and there you have it so we have our
149:49 - icon
149:50 - with a font size of five 2.5
149:55 - next we're going to style the heading so
149:57 - if you check here from the layout you
149:59 - can see
149:59 - the heading is as if it says two colors
150:02 - so we have some
150:03 - purple at the left and then on the right
150:05 - we have this pinkish color
150:07 - so here we're going to use background
150:08 - clipping
150:10 - so on typography we are going to style
150:13 - it the way we have done the html again
150:15 - so you can see we have display three so
150:17 - we're going to modify that
150:18 - display three so if you check again from
150:22 - the html here
150:23 - just to show you where we have the
150:25 - heading
150:27 - we have displayed three class and then
150:29 - minus minus title
150:31 - so you're going to modify it that we
150:33 - have done there
150:34 - so we have minus minus title
150:41 - so here i'm going to start with the font
150:42 - size
150:45 - i'm going to set that to 1.8 ram
150:52 - then text transform
150:55 - we're going to set that to capitalize
151:00 - and then font wait
151:03 - i'm going to use 600
151:07 - and then the font family so again to
151:08 - copy what we have here
151:15 - and then set the display to inline block
151:22 - so we have that background clip
151:26 - we're going to clip text
151:30 - so before we set the background clip we
151:32 - need to the background color
151:34 - so we have the background image
151:38 - we're going to use linear gradient
151:39 - because we need the two colors
151:42 - so the direction of the color is two
151:44 - right
151:47 - and then we have the first color primary
151:52 - second color secondary
152:00 - then we need to clip the text so here
152:02 - you're going to use a property called
152:05 - webkit text field color so we have
152:07 - webkit
152:09 - text field color and you're going to use
152:12 - transparent
152:15 - so i'm going to save let's see from the
152:17 - browser
152:21 - so here we need to set
152:25 - for the webkit
152:30 - background clip check on the browser
152:34 - and there you have it you can see now it
152:36 - has clipped that background color
152:39 - so here we need to set the display on
152:41 - the html
152:43 - to block so that they can be on separate
152:46 - lines
152:47 - so the html where we have the icon
152:51 - you're going to set the display to block
152:52 - so i'm going to select the three
152:55 - icon classes
153:00 - and then display block
153:05 - save let's see and there you have it
153:11 - so something else on the html we need to
153:13 - put to push
153:14 - the illustrations on the edge
153:20 - so we're going to select the second
153:23 - sorry the first one which is the
153:24 - marketing so we have that illustration
153:26 - we're going to add that class called
153:28 - text end where we have the column
153:31 - so we have the text end
153:34 - to push it to the edge
153:39 - and then for the web development you're
153:42 - going to also do the same
153:43 - on the illustration where we have that
153:45 - class sorry the column
153:49 - so we have the text stats
153:55 - and then also
153:59 - for the cloud hosting we have that
154:00 - illustration so we're going to set that
154:02 - to text end
154:05 - save let's see
154:09 - so now you can see the illustration have
154:11 - been pushed to the start
154:12 - and the end
154:18 - so something else is we need to do some
154:20 - correction on where we have the
154:22 - illustration
154:23 - so on the html let's start with the
154:25 - marketing
154:27 - so here we have that class called
154:29 - services underscore underscore content
154:31 - we need to change that to
154:33 - pick so that it represents the
154:37 - the illustration so let's do the same
154:40 - also for the second
154:42 - that is web development we're going to
154:44 - replace that with services underscore
154:46 - underscopic
154:48 - for picture and also the that one which
154:51 - is the
154:52 - cloud hosting i'm going to change that
154:53 - to
154:56 - pic
155:00 - then on the sass file we need to
155:03 - nest it that way we have done
155:07 - so we have
155:11 - underscore underscore peak so here
155:14 - you're going to set the max width
155:18 - to 100
155:23 - and then for the content we need to
155:26 - change the margin top to five ram
155:30 - so i'm going to save let's say from the
155:32 - browser
155:34 - so that is how our content looks like
155:37 - much better now
155:40 - next you're going to make sure that our
155:42 - section is fully responsive
155:43 - so i'm going to right click and inspect
155:45 - elements
155:47 - so this is how the section look like on
155:49 - moto g4
155:50 - that's our device with a screen window
155:52 - of 360.
155:54 - so you can see we have so much or big
155:55 - spaces between the contents
156:00 - so for the first one which is the space
156:02 - between the heading and the first
156:03 - description
156:04 - and this has to do with margin so let's
156:07 - go to the html
156:09 - so where we have the heading line you're
156:11 - going to change the margin bottom
156:12 - from mb5 to mb 1
156:16 - and then save let's see
156:20 - so you can see now the space has reduced
156:21 - a bit
156:23 - again also here we have the margin top
156:25 - where we have the first description
156:27 - let's change the margin top to zero
156:33 - save let's see so you can see now the
156:37 - space
156:38 - is much better the next one is the space
156:41 - between the second description and
156:43 - marketing so this is the content for
156:46 - the services so let's see from the html
156:52 - so again here you can see we have so
156:54 - many containers we have a container for
156:55 - the heading
156:56 - we have another container for the two
156:58 - description and another container for
157:01 - the services so let's remove the
157:03 - container where we have the
157:05 - description so so that they can share
157:07 - the container
157:08 - with the heading so let's remove
157:12 - this one and also this container
157:15 - so i'm going to save let's see
157:20 - so now the content is running nicely
157:24 - so the next one is the space between
157:27 - you can see here we have this space but
157:29 - still
157:31 - so here we're going to write a media
157:32 - breakpoint which is going to target
157:34 - large devices
157:35 - so on the sas file
157:39 - where we have the content we have margin
157:41 - top so here i'm going to create a media
157:43 - breakpoint which is going to target
157:45 - large devices we have that mixing
157:47 - include
157:49 - media breakpoint
157:54 - up
157:57 - so that is from large devices
158:02 - large so here i'm going to copy the
158:06 - margin top
158:07 - so we're going to set that to 5 ram
158:11 - and then the default you're going to set
158:13 - that to zero
158:17 - so i'm going to save let's see so you
158:20 - can see that one has already fixed that
158:23 - the next one is to work on the icon and
158:26 - the heading
158:27 - again here going to write another media
158:29 - breakpoint
158:32 - where we have the icon and the font size
158:35 - on typography so i'm going to copy this
158:37 - media breakpoint
158:39 - and use it where we have the icon
158:44 - so here on large devices you're going to
158:46 - set that to
158:49 - 2.5 and then the default you're going to
158:51 - set that to 1.5
158:53 - again on typography let's go to
158:55 - typography i have display three
158:59 - so let's copy that video breakpoint
159:04 - copy
159:09 - so here we're going to set the font size
159:10 - to 1.5 1.8
159:16 - 1.8
159:19 - and then for other devices it's going to
159:22 - remain to
159:23 - 0 to 1 ram and then i'm going to save
159:26 - let's see now
159:28 - so you can see that has already fixed
159:29 - that you can see the
159:31 - the icon and the heading they're a bit
159:34 - small now
159:35 - on small devices so i'm going to change
159:38 - another device
159:39 - larger than that let's see from an ipad
159:44 - also you can see the font size of the
159:46 - heading
159:47 - and the icon a bit small now so you can
159:50 - even reduce the font size of the text
159:55 - yeah let's do that so on the services
159:59 - inside the contents
160:03 - we have the paragraph that is the p
160:07 - font size
160:11 - so the default you're going to set that
160:12 - to 0.8 ram
160:15 - and then you're going to write another
160:16 - media breakpoint

166:34 - on the row
166:39 - then i'm going to save let's see
166:43 - so much better now next i'm going to add
166:46 - the background wave on this section
166:48 - so from the layout you can see we have a
166:50 - wave at the top of that
166:52 - section and another wave at the bottom
166:53 - of that section that means we have two
166:56 - waves so we're going to generate that
166:58 - from gatewaves dot io
167:00 - and here we're going to make sure that
167:01 - we generate something close or something
167:02 - similar like what we have on the left
167:05 - so here you're going to start with the
167:06 - top wave so i'm going to change the
167:08 - direction of the wave and then i'm going
167:11 - to play around with this
167:12 - icon till i find the one closed or

167:41 - and then at the bottom of that section
167:44 - paste then i'm going to change the again

167:50 - so we have the three f's or six f's i'm
167:53 - going to save let's see
167:56 - and now you can see that is our section
167:58 - with the two
167:59 - waves next i'm going to create the
168:02 - carousel
168:03 - so on the html i'm going to create
168:05 - another row for that content
168:08 - so i'm going to start with the comments
168:11 - start the carousel
168:14 - content
168:20 - so here i'm going to start a new row
168:23 - with a class of align item center
168:31 - so to save time i'm going to copy an
168:33 - example code from
168:35 - the bootstrap documentation
168:39 - so you can go to getbootstrap.com
168:43 - so this one is the bootstrap component
168:45 - so you can check on the components and
168:47 - then
168:47 - carousel so here i'm going to scroll
168:50 - down till i find the one
168:52 - that you're going to use so i'm going to
168:55 - copy the code
168:57 - for this one with captions so i'm going
168:59 - to copy this code
169:02 - and then i'm going to paste
169:05 - so next thing i'm going to do is just
169:08 - remove the
169:10 - the two carousel items and then be left
169:12 - to only one
169:15 - so i'm going to remove the second one
169:18 - and the third one
169:24 - and then i'm going also to remove the
169:27 - captions
169:34 - and also the indicators so i'm going
169:37 - also to remove the
169:38 - indicators
169:43 - also i'm going to remove the image and
169:46 - this class for colossal caption
169:50 - so i'm going to remove also that one
170:00 - so now let's go ahead and add our own
170:02 - carousel content
170:03 - so if you check from the layout here we
170:05 - have this container with the white
170:07 - background and that is the container for
170:09 - the text the two icons for the quotes
170:12 - and
170:12 - the stars then we have this client
170:14 - picture and then the client name and
170:16 - the role so that's how we're going to
170:18 - nest it and here we're going to use
170:20 - the block element modifier to nest it
170:23 - that way
170:24 - so first i'm going to list them the
170:26 - three containers
170:28 - so we have testimonials
170:34 - underscore underscore card so this is
170:36 - the container which will have the text
170:38 - the stars and the two icons for the
170:41 - quotes
170:45 - then i'm going to commend them so that
170:47 - we know where they start
170:49 - so we have
170:53 - testimonial
170:56 - card
171:01 - and then you're going to start again a
171:04 - comment
171:05 - we have the
171:10 - client picture
171:16 - so again we need a container for that
171:18 - which is testimonials
171:21 - underscore underscore picture
171:28 - and then we need the client's name
171:31 - enroll
171:38 - so again testimonials
171:42 - underscore underscore name
171:48 - so inside the card you're going to start
171:50 - with the text so we have a paragraph
171:52 - with a class of
171:53 - line height latch
171:57 - then we need that icon that is the left
172:00 - quote
172:00 - so we have the icon and then the font or
172:03 - some solid class
172:06 - and then the name of that icon is quote
172:12 - left
172:15 - then some dummy text so we have lorem
172:18 - 21
172:26 - and then we need the right quote
172:30 - so i'm just going to copy the first one
172:36 - and then this one is right
172:43 - then we need the stars so we have a
172:46 - class called ratings
172:50 - so we have the icon and then the font or
172:53 - some solid class
172:55 - and then the name of that icon is star
173:00 - so here i'm going to duplicate four more
173:03 - times

173:34 - so now we can add the pictures so here i
173:37 - have

174:31 - client just copy
174:37 - actually we need to make sure that the
174:38 - client name matches the name

174:44 - should not be that so i'm going to
174:45 - change the name

174:53 - so we have the name so i'm going to copy
174:55 - that

175:28 - so i'm going to save we can see how it
175:30 - looks like on the browser
175:34 - so this is how the content looks like so
175:36 - we're going to style it
175:40 - so let's make sure that we add to the
175:44 - rest of the
175:45 - client items that is the testimonial or
175:48 - carousel item so here i'm going to
175:50 - comment
175:51 - we have
175:55 - carousel item one
176:01 - then i'm going to duplicate carousel hm1
176:03 - for the second client

176:20 - and then change the client name so we
176:23 - have client 2.
176:26 - also the alt
176:29 - so you're going also to change the name
176:31 - so you can see from the layouts
176:36 - we have joy marette finance manager
176:46 - and then the role of that client is
176:48 - finance manager
176:56 - i'm going to duplicate carousel at m2

178:14 - so that is co ceo end founder
178:20 - so i'm going to save let's say
178:25 - so we have the corrosion items so the
178:28 - buttons can't work
178:29 - until we change the active class so the
178:32 - only
178:32 - corrosion item we need to be active is
178:34 - the first one
178:37 - so you can see here we have a crossover
178:39 - active so we need to change
178:42 - the rest so remove the active class
178:46 - for the second third and the fourth one
178:52 - so save
178:55 - so now if you click the controls you'll
178:58 - see
178:59 - they are working
179:02 - so the next step now is to style this
179:05 - section so on testimonials.css you're
179:09 - going to style it the way we have nested
179:11 - on the html
179:12 - so we're going to start
179:17 - with the first one which is the card so
179:19 - we have
179:20 - the underscore underscore card
179:26 - and then we have underscore underscore
179:29 - picture
179:34 - and then we have underscore underscore
179:40 - name
179:42 - so for the card we are going to set the
179:44 - background color to white
179:48 - so actually i'm going to use rgb
179:53 - so we have the white color
179:56 - with an opacity of 0.8
180:02 - then we need some padding so i'm going
180:04 - to set the padding to 2 ram
180:10 - that is for the top and bottom and then
180:13 - 1.25
180:15 - for the left and right
180:19 - then we need the border radius
180:25 - so i'm going to set that to 0.625
180:31 - ram and then some height you're going to
180:35 - set that to auto
180:42 - so we need to align text at the center
180:44 - so we have text align
180:50 - center
180:54 - so i'm going to save let's see how it
180:56 - looks like so far
180:59 - so that's how it's look like that is the
181:01 - container for the text
181:03 - and the two coats and the stars
181:09 - also inside the card we're going to
181:11 - style the two icons for the quotes
181:14 - and the star ratings so here we have the
181:17 - icon
181:19 - and here i'm going to start with the
181:20 - font size of that icon
181:23 - so here i'm going to use 1.5 ram
181:26 - and then the color
181:31 - so i'm going to use rgba we have primary
181:36 - with an opacity of 0.7
181:43 - then we also need to style the star
181:47 - ratings or the rating stars
181:50 - so we have that class inside the card
181:52 - also
181:57 - and then the icon is inside the ratings
181:59 - so we have
182:01 - the icon and you're going to set the
182:04 - color and the font size
182:07 - so for the color going to copy what
182:09 - you've used here on the
182:11 - icons for the quotes
182:15 - and then set the font size
182:18 - we're going to use one ram
182:22 - so i'm going to save let's see from the
182:24 - browser
182:28 - so there you have it you can see now
182:29 - they have changed the color
182:37 - next let's style the picture and here on
182:40 - the picture i'm going to start by
182:42 - setting
182:42 - the wind and the height so you have wind
182:47 - i'm going to set that to 6 ram we can
182:49 - change that if it's too small or too
182:51 - large
182:52 - also the same with height
182:55 - 6 ram and then we need to set the
182:58 - position to absolute
183:05 - so i'm going to save let's see
183:10 - so now that is the size of the picture
183:12 - so we need to make it
183:14 - circle or rounded so on the html we're
183:17 - going to add that rounded circle class
183:20 - on the image or the picture so i'm going
183:23 - to select the four
183:24 - classes
183:27 - and then i'm going to add rounded circle
183:33 - i'm going to save let's see
183:37 - so now you can see our pictures around
183:39 - it the next thing now is to position
183:41 - these pictures
183:43 - at the center of this white container
183:49 - so back on the testimonials where we
183:51 - have that picture
183:53 - so here we're going to set left
183:56 - we're going to use 50
184:01 - then we have transform
184:06 - translate we have minus 50 percent
184:11 - minus 50
184:14 - and then i'm going to save let's see
184:18 - and as you can see that is the position
184:20 - that you want it
184:22 - so the next thing is to add the border
184:25 - the rounded border
184:29 - so here we have the image
184:32 - and then we have the border
184:37 - so wind i'm going to use 0.325 ram
184:41 - solid and then color
184:46 - we're going to use rgba
184:50 - we have primary
184:55 - with an opacity of 0.7
185:00 - i'm going to save let's see
185:05 - and there you have it you can see now
185:06 - our picture has that border
185:09 - next you're going to style the name
185:13 - so we have the name here
185:17 - so i'm going to start with the padding
185:19 - top to give it some space
185:22 - so we have padding top i'm going to use
185:24 - forem
185:28 - we need some margin at the bottom so we
185:31 - have margin bottom
185:35 - i'm going to use one ram
185:38 - we need to align text at the center so
185:40 - we have text align
185:44 - center
185:47 - then we need some font to it
185:52 - so here i'm going to use 500
185:56 - and then the color of the text
186:00 - white
186:07 - so then you can see
186:11 - we're going to nest it they have down on
186:12 - the html so we have h3
186:17 - so here we can just set the padding top
186:23 - to 0.8 ram so i'm going to save let's
186:27 - see
186:31 - and there you have it i think forum is a
186:33 - bit it's too big
186:35 - so let me change that to three
186:40 - save so
186:43 - there is better so the next thing
186:46 - is to style the role
186:51 - so before we go to the role we need to
186:53 - add the text transform
186:56 - so we need to set that to capitalize
187:02 - and then we need now to style the role
187:05 - so we have a paragraph
187:08 - some padding at the bottom padding
187:11 - bottom
187:11 - you're going to set that to 2 ram
187:16 - then text transform you're going to set
187:19 - to capitalize
187:22 - so i'm going to save let's see
187:25 - and there you have it that is our role
187:30 - so the only thing i'm going to do is put
187:32 - some
187:33 - padding on the stars so on the html
187:37 - where we have the stars
187:41 - i'm going to select all the classes for
187:43 - ratings
187:45 - the four of them at once and then i'm
187:48 - going to add padding
187:49 - one save let's see
187:54 - so much better now
187:58 - next i'm going to customize the controls
188:00 - from the layout you can see we have the
188:02 - controls at the bottom
188:04 - so we're going to customize and replace
188:05 - the defaults which are on the sides you
188:07 - can see we have these
188:08 - two controls on the sides so let's work
188:11 - on that
188:14 - so at the bottom here you're going to
188:15 - remove the span
188:19 - for the two
188:25 - and then you're going to replace this
188:27 - class carousel control
188:30 - for the previous we're going to use the
188:31 - btn classes
188:33 - so here we have btn btn outline
188:40 - outline lights and then we need that
188:43 - icon
188:44 - that is the font awesome icon so we have
188:46 - the glass front or some solid
188:49 - and then the name of that icon is
188:54 - long arrow alt right so we have it here
188:59 - so this one is left and then i'm going
189:02 - to copy this class
189:04 - to the next button or to the next class
189:12 - paste and then
189:15 - you need to change that to right
189:19 - then i'm going to save let's see from
189:21 - the browser
189:24 - so now you can see we have the controls
189:26 - but we need them at the center
189:28 - so let also work on that so here i'm
189:31 - going to put them
189:32 - inside a container called the text
189:34 - center so i'm going to select all of
189:35 - them
189:36 - the two and then add text center class
189:42 - so we have text center
189:48 - and then paste them inside that
189:50 - container or that class
189:53 - and then i'm going to save let's see
189:57 - so now you can see we have the controls
189:59 - at the center
190:01 - and you can see once you click they are
190:04 - moving to the next
190:05 - glance or carousel item
190:10 - so the next step now is to make sure
190:12 - that our section is fully responsive so
190:14 - i'm going to right click
190:15 - and inspect elements
190:20 - so first again to see how it looks like
190:22 - on various devices you can see this one
190:24 - is moto g4
190:25 - again screen width 360.
190:28 - and you can see the content is fitting
190:30 - nicely on that
190:31 - screen device so let's see from another
190:34 - device
190:36 - like pixel 2 again you can see
190:39 - our content is fitting nicely
190:42 - let's see from an ipad again you can see
190:47 - the content is fitting nicely so even
190:49 - without writing
190:50 - the media breakpoints you can see our
190:52 - section is
190:54 - fully responsive so i'm going to look
190:56 - from another device
190:57 - like iphone 678 plus
191:01 - and as you can see our section is fully
191:04 - responsive
191:06 - so with that we can move on to the next
191:08 - section
191:11 - welcome back in this video we are going
191:13 - to create section 6 of the layout
191:15 - which is the frequently asked questions
191:18 - so we are going to use bootstrap
191:19 - component called
191:20 - accordion so once you click on the
191:22 - question then the accordion collapses
191:25 - and
191:25 - reveals the item so let's get started
191:28 - and create something similar like what
191:29 - we have here on the layout
191:31 - so on the html we are going to start
191:33 - that section first is a comment we have
191:37 - start section 6
191:42 - the frequently asked questions
191:52 - so i'm going to start the section with
191:55 - an id of
191:56 - frequently asked questions faq and a
191:58 - class of faq
192:01 - we need a container
192:05 - and also arrow
192:08 - tab so here you're going to start
192:12 - with the heading and then the heading
192:15 - line and then the subheading
192:18 - so here we have h1 with a class of
192:21 - display three
192:24 - and a class of font-weight bold
192:31 - so we have faq and here we also need to
192:34 - add another class which is
192:36 - text capitalize or text uppercase
192:41 - you can see up we have that class text
192:44 - uppercase
192:45 - and also on the row we need to add the
192:47 - text center class
192:54 - after the heading we have that heading
192:55 - line so we have that class
192:57 - heading line
193:02 - and then the sub heading which is a
193:05 - paragraph with a class of lead
193:11 - so i'm going to copy
193:17 - and then paste and then i'm going to
193:21 - save let's see
193:22 - from the browser
193:26 - and there you have it you have it you
193:27 - can see now we have that heading
193:30 - next i'm going to add the accordion
193:32 - content so
193:33 - on the html i'm going to create a new
193:35 - row for that content
193:37 - so we have the comment which is
193:39 - accordion
193:41 - content
193:47 - so i'm going to start a new row
193:50 - and some margin at the top so i'm going
193:51 - to choose margin top 5
193:55 - and then here you need to specify the
193:57 - column size that you want to use
193:59 - so that one will reflect on the size of
194:01 - the accordion that you're going to have
194:04 - so for now we can use call md 12.
194:08 - so that one will go full length
194:12 - so to save time i'm going to copy the
194:14 - example code from the bootstrap
194:15 - documentation
194:18 - so you can go to get bootstrap.com and
194:20 - then under the components you'll find
194:22 - accordion so here there are two examples
194:25 - that you can copy we have the first one
194:28 - and then we have the second one called
194:30 - the accordion flash
194:32 - so this one removes the default
194:33 - background color some borders and some
194:35 - rounded corners to render accordions
194:37 - edge to edge with their parent container
194:40 - so i'm going to copy the example for the
194:42 - first one
194:44 - so i'm going to copy the entire code and
194:47 - then paste
194:49 - and there you have it so here because we
194:53 - have four
194:54 - accordion items you can see from the
194:56 - layout
194:58 - you can see we have four so we need to
195:00 - duplicate one
195:01 - which is the third so we have from here
195:06 - i'm going to duplicate for the fourth
195:09 - accordion item
195:12 - so once you duplicate you must change
195:14 - some
195:15 - things like the id attributes you can
195:18 - see here
195:19 - collapse 3 we need to change that to 4.
195:24 - also you need to change the area
195:27 - labeled by so you need to change that to
195:32 - 4.
195:34 - also this one is three is four
195:45 - then i'm going to save let's see from
195:47 - the browser
195:51 - and that is our content so once you
195:53 - click then
195:54 - the accordion collapses and reveals the
195:56 - item
195:58 - so we have according to accordion item
196:01 - two we have accordion item three and
196:02 - finally accordion item
196:04 - four so let's comment this accordion
196:07 - item so that you can know where they
196:08 - start
196:09 - let's start with the first one so we
196:10 - have accordion item one
196:12 - so i'm going to comment that
196:16 - accordion item one
196:19 - that is a comment
196:22 - so i'm going to copy that comment for
196:24 - the rest of the accordion items
196:27 - we have the second one
196:34 - we have the third one
196:39 - and finally we have the fourth
196:45 - so now we are ready to customize the
196:48 - accordion
196:50 - so here we're going to customize a few
196:51 - things if you check from the layout here
196:53 - we're going to add
196:55 - some space between the accordion items
196:57 - so that we can separate the accordion
196:59 - items and then you're going to add
197:00 - shadow
197:01 - and then you're going to add some
197:02 - padding between the questions
197:05 - and then also we need to change the
197:07 - question to reflect what we have here on
197:08 - the left
197:09 - so let's work on that so first i'm going
197:13 - to
197:13 - select all the accordion items so that
197:15 - we can add the two classes
197:18 - so we're going to add shadow
197:21 - and then you're going to separate or add
197:23 - some space between the accordion items
197:25 - by using margin
197:26 - bottom so we have margin bottom three
197:29 - so i'm going to save let's see
197:34 - and there you have it you can see now we
197:36 - have some space between the accordion
197:38 - items and then
197:39 - that shadow so the next one is to make
197:41 - sure that the questions reflect what we
197:43 - have here on the left
197:44 - so we have the first question so i'm
197:47 - going to copy
197:48 - so i have changed the question i'm going
197:50 - to save let's say from the browser
197:53 - so now you can see the questions reflect
197:55 - what you have there on the layout
197:56 - so the next one is to add some padding
197:58 - between the questions
198:00 - so here we have accordion padding x and
198:03 - accordion padding y
198:06 - so to do that you're going to override
198:07 - some of the bootstrap defaults
198:09 - so you're going to go to the variables
198:11 - file which can be found inside the node
198:13 - modules
198:14 - and that is the bootstrap variables file
198:16 - and then bootstrap
198:17 - scss and then down here you have that
198:20 - file
198:21 - variables.css
198:24 - so here on the variables where we have
198:25 - the accordion we're going to copy
198:28 - the two variables that is according
198:30 - padding y and you can see the default is
198:32 - one ram
198:33 - and according paddingx and the default
198:36 - is 1.2
198:36 - ram so i'm going to copy the two
198:39 - variables
198:41 - and then inside the custom
198:46 - so where we have the according overheads
198:49 - i'm going to add that
198:51 - variables and then i'm going to remove
198:52 - the two defaults
198:55 - or the default flag so here you're going
198:58 - to override
199:00 - according padding y to 1.5 and also
199:04 - according padding x we're going also to
199:05 - override that to 1.5
199:08 - so both are going to use 1.5 ram so i'm
199:10 - going to save
199:12 - let's see and there you have it you can
199:15 - see now
199:16 - we have that padding and that is what we
199:20 - have here on the layout
199:22 - so you can see the space is the same
199:26 - next is to make sure that our section is
199:28 - fully responsive so i'm going to right
199:30 - click and
199:30 - inspect element so this is how the
199:34 - section look like
199:35 - on a screen window of 360. that's
199:38 - moto g4 and you can see the content is
199:41 - fitting nicely
199:43 - so i'm going to change to another screen
199:44 - device like ipad
199:46 - ipad again you can see our content is
199:50 - fitting nicely on that
199:51 - screen device so let's change to another
199:54 - one like
199:55 - iphone 6 7 8 plus
199:59 - again you can see our content is fitting
200:01 - nicely so even without
200:03 - creating or writing any media breakpoint
200:06 - our section is fully responsive
200:10 - so we can move on to the next section
200:16 - welcome back in this video we are going
200:18 - to create section 7 of the layout which
200:20 - is the portfolio
200:21 - so here going to showcase some of the
200:22 - latest projects that our fake
200:24 - company has created so here we have some
200:27 - buttons
200:28 - and then once you hover the project
200:29 - you'll see they reveal the project name
200:32 - and the category of that project so
200:34 - let's get started and create something
200:36 - similar like what you have here on the
200:37 - layout
200:38 - so on the html i'm going to start that
200:40 - section
200:42 - and i'm going to start with the comment
200:43 - as always so we have stat
200:48 - section 7
200:51 - the portfolio
200:58 - so let's start that section with an idea
201:02 - of
201:02 - portfolio
201:06 - and a class of portfolio
201:11 - we need a container
201:14 - and a row tab
201:19 - so here going to start with the heading
201:22 - we have the latest work and then heading
201:24 - line and then subheading
201:29 - so we have h1 with a class of
201:32 - display three and a class of font-weight
201:36 - bold
201:40 - so latest work
201:44 - so here i'm going also to add another
201:45 - class which is text capitalize
201:51 - and then the heading line below the
201:52 - heading so we have
201:54 - heading line
202:02 - then the subheading we have the
202:03 - paragraph with the class of lead
202:08 - some dummy text so lorem 12
202:12 - save let's see
202:17 - so we have our text now so let's put it
202:20 - on the center at the center
202:22 - so here on the row i'm going to add text
202:24 - center class
202:27 - save let's see so there you have it
202:30 - but now we need some space between the
202:34 - the previous section and the heading
202:38 - so on the row here i'm going to add some
202:39 - margin at the top so we have
202:41 - margin top five
202:45 - save let's see
202:50 - so now you can see we have some space
202:52 - between the previous section and
202:55 - that heading next i'm going to add
202:58 - the filter buttons so we have these
203:00 - buttons for filtering the categories
203:03 - so let's add the buttons
203:06 - so here i'm going to add another row for
203:08 - that content so we have
203:11 - filter buttons
203:18 - so a neuro with a class of text center
203:25 - and then a column so we're going to use
203:28 - call md12
203:34 - so here we have button
203:38 - with a class of btn
203:41 - and then btn outline primary
203:49 - and the type of the button is button
203:52 - so we have type which is button
204:11 - so so we have all
204:15 - and then i'm going to duplicate for the
204:18 - categories
204:21 - so the second category is websites
204:25 - the next one is design and then we have
204:28 - mockup
204:33 - so i'm going to save let's see from the
204:35 - browser
204:38 - and now you can see we have the buttons
204:40 - so what you're going to do is add some
204:42 - margin at the top so that you can have
204:45 - some space between the
204:47 - heading the subheading and the buttons
204:50 - so here we have the row we are going to
204:52 - add margin top
204:54 - three and then save let's see
205:00 - so i think we need to increase the
205:02 - margin so here i'm going to use margin
205:04 - top five
205:05 - and then margin bottom four and then
205:09 - some gutter so we're going to use gutter
205:11 - three
205:12 - and then save
205:16 - so now you can see we have some enough
205:19 - space
205:21 - next i'm going to add the content for
205:23 - their portfolio items
205:25 - from the layout here we have the nine
205:26 - columns which make up the nine portfolio
205:28 - items
205:29 - first i'm going to copy the portfolio
205:31 - images or the pictures to my project
205:34 - so here i have a folder called portfolio
205:35 - it has all the pictures for the
205:37 - portfolio
205:38 - they are named portfolio one all the way
205:39 - to portfolio nine
205:41 - and they are in jpeg so i'm going to
205:43 - copy the entire folder to my project
205:48 - so inside the images paste
205:52 - so now we have the pictures in our
205:53 - project now we can go ahead and add
205:56 - the portfolio items all that content
206:00 - so here you're going to create a new row
206:01 - for that content
206:03 - so i'm going to start with a comment
206:05 - which is that
206:08 - the portfolio content or portfolio items
206:15 - so here i'm going to create a new row
206:17 - and here i'm going to use emit to help
206:19 - us generate
206:20 - the 9 portfolio items at once so after
206:23 - draw we need the columns
206:25 - and here i'm going to group them and i'm
206:27 - going to create two
206:29 - breakpoints for large devices i'm going
206:32 - to use
206:33 - call lg4
206:37 - and then for medium devices i'm going to
206:40 - use call md6
206:43 - then we need the container for all the
206:45 - portfolio items
206:47 - so i'm going to call it portfolio box
206:52 - and then we need shadow so i'm going to
206:54 - add that shadow class
206:58 - and then we need the picture or the
207:00 - image
207:02 - so here again i'm going to group the
207:04 - picture the picture so we have the image
207:07 - and then the source of the images
207:11 - so we have a folder called images and
207:14 - then portfolio
207:15 - where we have the pictures
207:20 - so here we need the name of the files so
207:22 - we have
207:25 - portfolio minus
207:28 - dollar sign dot jpg
207:32 - so the dollar sign will assign each
207:34 - value so that
207:36 - we can have portfolio one to portfolio
207:38 - nine
207:39 - and they are in jpeg formats then we
207:42 - need the
207:43 - alt so we have portfolio
207:50 - dollar sign image
207:53 - and then also we need the title so we
207:56 - have
207:57 - title
208:01 - so we have portfolio
208:04 - dollar sign picture
208:09 - then we need the class for responsive
208:11 - image so we're going to use
208:13 - image fluid that one is a bootstrap
208:15 - response a
208:16 - bootstrap class for responsive images
208:19 - so we have image fluid
208:27 - then from there we need the container
208:29 - for the caption so i'm going to call it
208:34 - portfolio info
208:39 - and then we need the caption so we're
208:42 - going to create another class
208:44 - so we have div and then caption
208:50 - then from there we need the
208:54 - the caption so we're going to use h4
208:58 - so we have h4 and the text will be
209:01 - project name
209:04 - goes here and then dollar sign
209:09 - and also the category project you have
209:11 - the p
209:13 - and then the text will be category
209:18 - project
209:20 - so at the end here i'm going to say
209:22 - times nine
209:24 - and it's going to generate for us all
209:25 - the nine portfolio items
209:28 - with the content so here you can specify
209:30 - the number of
209:32 - columns or the portfolio items that you
209:33 - want it to generate so we have nine so
209:35 - i'm going to say times nine
209:37 - hit tab and here you can see now it has
209:41 - generated for us all the contents
209:43 - including the pictures and it has a send
209:46 - also the values so i'm going to save
209:50 - let's see from the browser
209:54 - and there you have it you can see now we
209:56 - have the nine portfolio items
210:02 - next i'm going to style the content and
210:05 - we have a sass file for that
210:07 - section which is portfolio.css so i'm
210:10 - going to open that file
210:12 - and here the first thing i'm going to do
210:13 - is to use the module
210:15 - so we have the use
210:18 - and then custom that is the first module
210:21 - you're going to use because of the
210:22 - variables
210:25 - so use it at the start and then
210:28 - also we're going to use the mixing
210:33 - so we have components and then mixing
210:39 - so again use it as star and then close
210:43 - so here i'm going to start by styling
210:45 - the class called
210:46 - portfolio
210:50 - so this is the class we have on the
210:51 - section if we check from the html we
210:53 - have that class
210:56 - here on the section
211:00 - so here i'm going to set the padding
211:03 - and i'm going to set 4m for the top and
211:06 - bottom
211:06 - and then 0 for the left and right
211:10 - then you're going also to style the
211:13 - text on the buttons so we need to set
211:16 - the
211:17 - text transform to capitalize
211:22 - so we have the button
211:27 - so text transform capitalize
211:32 - i'm going to save let's see
211:36 - so now we have the text set to
211:39 - capitalize and you can see now they are
211:40 - capitalized
211:43 - so the next thing is to style the
211:45 - portfolio box and that one is a
211:47 - standalone
211:49 - container so we have portfolio
211:55 - box so here i'm going to start with the
211:59 - position
212:00 - i'm going to set that to relative
212:06 - then we're going to set the width
212:09 - 200 percent so the width is going to
212:12 - scale to the
212:13 - wind of the columns so remember here on
212:16 - the html we have
212:18 - the two columns we have call lg4 and
212:22 - column d6
212:23 - so those are two different breakpoints
212:27 - and then also the height we're going to
212:29 - set that to
212:31 - 18.5 ram
212:35 - we can change that later to bigger too
212:37 - small
212:40 - so that means all our portfolio items
212:42 - will have an equal height
212:44 - so i'm going to save let's see from the
212:46 - browser
212:48 - so now you can see we have equal height
212:50 - on all portfolio items
212:53 - so the next thing is to style the images
212:57 - or the pictures to scale to the height
212:59 - of the portfolio box so here we're going
213:02 - to style it
213:03 - inside the portfolio box we have the
213:04 - image
213:06 - and here i'm going to set the width and
213:07 - the height to 100 percent
213:12 - 100 and also height
213:16 - so the height of the image is going to
213:17 - scale to the
213:19 - height of the parent container which is
213:21 - the
213:22 - portfolio box and we have set that to
213:24 - 18.5 ram
213:26 - so we have 100 save
213:29 - let's see so now you can see the
213:33 - pictures are scaled to the height of the
213:35 - parent container so the next thing is to
213:37 - hide
213:38 - some of the caption you can see they're
213:41 - overflowing
213:43 - so here you're going to use a property
213:45 - called overflow
213:46 - and you're going to set that to hidden
213:52 - save let's see
213:55 - and there you have it you can see now
213:56 - they are hidden
213:59 - let's also add some margin at the bottom
214:01 - so that we can separate the
214:03 - portfolio items
214:06 - so here we're going to set the margin
214:09 - bottom
214:11 - to 1.2 ram
214:14 - save let's see and
214:17 - there you have it you can see now we
214:18 - have some margin at the bottom
214:21 - to separate the portfolio items
214:27 - next i'm going to style the captions and
214:29 - also add the border at the top
214:31 - so if you check here from the layout you
214:32 - can see we have a board at the top
214:35 - and the captioning is only visible once
214:37 - you hover the portfolio item
214:39 - so let's work on that
214:42 - so here we're going again to nest it the
214:44 - way we have done on the html so we have
214:46 - the portfolio info
214:47 - inside the portfolio box so we have that
214:50 - class
214:53 - so this is the class or the container
214:55 - which has that background
214:57 - color so we have here going to set that
215:00 - background color
215:03 - so we have rgba so we have our primary
215:10 - an opacity of 0.75
215:14 - and then i'm going to set the width and
215:15 - the height 200 percent
215:17 - so we have width 100 percent
215:22 - and also height
215:29 - also here i'm going to set the position
215:32 - to absolute
215:39 - and then we have the caption inside
215:42 - the portfolio info so we have that class
215:49 - so here i'm going to set the text align
215:50 - to center
216:01 - so i'm going to save let's see
216:07 - so nothing to show so here we're going
216:09 - to set the top
216:10 - to zero
216:14 - so we need to set that top zero
216:17 - and then i'm going to save let's see
216:21 - so now you can see we have the caption
216:24 - and that's background so the next thing
216:27 - is to position
216:28 - the caption at the center of the
216:30 - portfolio item
216:33 - so on the caption you're going to
216:34 - include that mixer so we have
216:37 - include which is going to position it at
216:40 - the center
216:41 - and you have that mixing code absolute
216:46 - center
216:48 - going to save let's see so now you can
216:51 - see we have the caption at the center
216:53 - so let's change the color
217:00 - so we have white close
217:04 - save let's see and
217:07 - there you have it so let's change
217:11 - or set detect text transform to
217:13 - uppercase
217:14 - so that we can make sure that the
217:15 - caption are in uppercase like what you
217:17 - have here on the left
217:20 - so let's set that so inside the caption
217:23 - we have that h4
217:26 - so text transform we're going to set
217:29 - that to uppercase
217:34 - and then i'm going to save let's see
217:38 - and there you have it
217:44 - next we need to hide the captions and
217:47 - only make them visible
217:48 - once you hover the portfolio item
217:51 - so here we have the container for the
217:52 - caption which is portfolio info
217:54 - so here we need to set the opacity to
217:56 - zero
217:58 - and also visibility to hidden so we have
218:01 - opacity 0 and then
218:03 - visibility i'm going to set that to
218:07 - hidden so i'm going to save let's see
218:13 - so now you can see the captions have
218:15 - been hidden
218:17 - so we need the caption to be visible
218:19 - once you hover
218:20 - the portfolio item so down here we're
218:23 - going to create that over
218:28 - so we have the hoover effect
218:33 - and then you're going to call this class
218:38 - portfolio
218:41 - and then you're going to set the opacity
218:43 - to 1
218:45 - and visibility to visible so opacity
218:48 - 1 and visibility
218:52 - visible
218:56 - i'm going to save let's see
219:00 - so now if you hover the portfolio time
219:02 - you can see
219:04 - the captions are visible
219:11 - the next thing is to add the border top
219:14 - at the top we need the board at the top
219:15 - like what we have here on the left
219:18 - so you can see we have that board at the
219:20 - top so let's also
219:22 - set that so we need it
219:25 - at the portfolio box so border
219:31 - top i'm going to use 0.5 frame
219:34 - for the wind solid
219:39 - and then the color we're going to use
219:41 - purple light so we have that color on
219:43 - the customs as well
219:48 - purple light
219:51 - i'm going to save let's see
219:54 - so you can see now we have that border
219:56 - at the top
219:58 - so something else i'm going to do is to
220:00 - create a transition which you're going
220:02 - to apply on the hoover effect so you can
220:04 - see once you hover the
220:05 - portfolio item that hover is so dry
220:08 - so let's create a transition which
220:09 - you're going to apply so that we can
220:11 - have that smooth hoover effect
220:13 - on the portfolio items
220:17 - so here we're going to create a mixing
220:19 - which you're going to use
220:20 - where we need to use that transition so
220:23 - i'm going to open that mixing
220:26 - and then down here we're going to create
220:29 - that
220:30 - mixing so i'm going to start with a
220:32 - comment which is
220:35 - transition
220:44 - property
220:46 - so we have the mixing art mixing
220:51 - and the name of that mixing i'm going to
220:52 - call it
220:54 - transition property
221:03 - so we are going to use transition
221:06 - duration
221:11 - so we have that and here i'm going to
221:14 - set to 1000 milliseconds
221:18 - another property you need is the
221:20 - transition property so
221:21 - we have transition property
221:26 - so i'm going to set to all and then i'm
221:29 - going to save
221:31 - then you're going to include this mixing
221:33 - where we have that hoover effect
221:34 - or any other place that you want to use
221:36 - that transition
221:38 - so we have the portfolio and then here
221:42 - i'm going to include
221:44 - that mixing so we have include
221:49 - and then transition
221:54 - property
221:56 - so i'm going to save let's say from the
221:59 - browser
222:01 - so now you can see once i hover the
222:03 - portfolio item you can see we have that
222:05 - smooth
222:05 - over effect or that smooth transition
222:13 - so something else before we finish this
222:15 - part is to
222:17 - i'm going to set where we have the
222:20 - portfolio
222:22 - info so we have top zero and left
222:25 - zero so i'm going to set also that
222:28 - to zero and then where we have
222:32 - that caption the heading i'm going to
222:34 - set
222:35 - the display to block
222:41 - so i'm going to save
222:45 - so now if you hover the portfolio you
222:47 - can see
222:49 - we have that smooth effect
222:58 - so before i finish up on the portfolio
223:00 - i'm going to do a few changes on the
223:02 - height
223:02 - of the images because you're going to
223:04 - have some issues on the height of the
223:06 - images on smaller devices
223:08 - so i'm going to right click and then i'm
223:10 - going to click on inspect
223:11 - elements
223:16 - so especially on medium devices you can
223:18 - see this one is a medium device and you
223:20 - can see the height is not scaling nicely
223:21 - so i'm going to rotate
223:23 - this width or the screen
223:27 - and here you'll see just like i said
223:29 - you're going to have some issues with
223:31 - the height of the images
223:32 - they're not scaling nicely on different
223:35 - devices
223:36 - so to make that work we're going to use
223:38 - maximum width
223:39 - on the height where we have the
223:40 - portfolio box
223:43 - so instead of the height we're going to
223:45 - set that using the max height
223:47 - so i'm going to set that max height
223:49 - which is going to scale to 18.5 ram
223:52 - and then on the image i'm going to
223:54 - remove the height
223:56 - so i'm going just to comment it and then
223:59 - i'm going to save
224:00 - let's see whether it will fix that so
224:01 - save let's see
224:04 - so now just like i said you can see now
224:06 - the images are scaling nicely
224:08 - that is the height of the images so we
224:12 - don't have issues now with the height
224:13 - of the images on medium devices
224:19 - so i'm going to close the inspector and
224:22 - then i'm going to resize the browser
224:24 - window
224:26 - so you can see now we don't have the
224:27 - issues with the height of the images
224:32 - they are scaling nicely
224:36 - so something else is we need to add
224:39 - where we have the image that is on hover
224:43 - we need to scale the images a bit
224:46 - so where we have that hoover pseudo
224:49 - class
224:50 - we're going to add we're going to scale
224:53 - the images
224:54 - so we have transform
225:00 - and then scale and then i'm going to
225:02 - scale that to 1.5
225:05 - so i'm going to save let's see
225:08 - so close that before we do we save and
225:11 - then save
225:14 - so now if you hover the images you can
225:16 - see they are scaling a bit so i'm going
225:17 - to
225:18 - enlarge the browser window
225:23 - welcome back in this video we're going
225:25 - to create section 8 of the layout which
225:27 - is the get started also known as cta or
225:29 - call to action section so here you're
225:31 - going to start with the heading and then
225:32 - you're going to create the two equal
225:34 - columns
225:35 - with the left column having the cta info
225:37 - and then the right
225:38 - or the second column having the form so
225:41 - let's get started and create something
225:42 - similar like what we have on the left
225:44 - so on the html i'm going to start that
225:46 - section
225:48 - so i'm going to start with the comment
225:49 - as always so we have start
225:52 - section 8
225:55 - get started
226:02 - so we have that section
226:06 - with a with an id of contacts
226:09 - and a class of get started
226:14 - we need a container
226:19 - and arrow
226:22 - tab so here going to start with the
226:25 - heading
226:27 - so we have h1 with a class of display
226:30 - three
226:34 - and a class of it bold
226:37 - and a class of text capitalize
226:45 - so we have that text get started
226:51 - then on the row here we need to add the
226:53 - text center class
226:55 - so text center
226:59 - so after the heading we need the heading
227:02 - line so we have that class
227:04 - heading line
227:08 - and then the subheading so we have p
227:11 - with a class of line heights
227:13 - large and then some dummy text we have
227:16 - lorem 12
227:19 - and then i'm going to save let's see
227:21 - from the browser so far
227:25 - so now we have that text
227:28 - next i'm going to style this section and
227:31 - here we're going to set some padding
227:32 - and some background color so you can see
227:34 - here from the layout
227:35 - we're going to use this a gray color
227:38 - so let's work on that so we have a file
227:42 - for that section which is
227:43 - get started so i'm going to open that
227:46 - file
227:47 - and here the first thing i'm going to do
227:48 - is to use the modules so we have the
227:51 - custom module and the mixing module so
227:54 - we have the use
227:57 - and then custom
228:02 - so again use it as star
228:09 - also we need the mixing so we have again
228:12 - use
228:16 - components mixing
228:21 - use as star
228:25 - so i'm going to style the class we have
228:27 - on the section which is
228:28 - the get started so we have this class
228:37 - so here i'm going to set some padding
228:39 - top and bottom i'm going to set that to
228:41 - 4m
228:44 - and then left and right 0 then the
228:47 - background color
228:48 - we're going to use one of the gray
228:49 - colors
228:51 - so here i'm going to use gray 200.
228:59 - then i'm going to save let's see from
229:01 - the browser
229:05 - so there you have it next i'm going to
229:07 - create the two columns
229:09 - from the left here we have the two
229:10 - columns we have the left column with
229:12 - this gradient background
229:14 - which will have the cta info and then we
229:16 - have the red column with this
229:18 - white background which will have the
229:19 - form so let's work on that
229:23 - so on the html i'm going to create a new
229:24 - row for that content
229:28 - first let's start with a comment which
229:30 - is start
229:32 - the cta info or the cta content
229:41 - so i'm going to start a new row
229:45 - which will have the two columns so we
229:47 - have a row with a class of text white
229:52 - and then we have the two columns so i'm
229:54 - going to group them
229:56 - i'm going to start with call 12 and
229:59 - another column
230:00 - which i'm going to use called lg 6. then
230:06 - here at the end i'm going to say
230:07 - times two hit tab
230:11 - so on the first column we're going to
230:13 - have that gradient background
230:14 - and then on the second column we're
230:16 - going to have that white background
230:19 - so on the first column i'm going to add
230:20 - a class called gradient which you're
230:22 - going to create in a moment
230:23 - so gradient and then also shadow
230:27 - and some padding so i'm going to use p
230:30 - padding 3. and then on the second column
230:33 - we are going to have
230:34 - white background so we have bg white
230:37 - and then some shadow
230:40 - and also padding three
230:47 - then i'm going to create that gradient
230:49 - and we already have that
230:50 - mixing so i'm going to go to that file
230:53 - mixing.css
230:55 - so you're going to copy this gradient
230:57 - and then create it
230:58 - as a class so i'm going to copy
231:01 - and then on typography you're going to
231:04 - create it on that file
231:06 - so here we have our comment
231:10 - which is gradient bg
231:15 - and then we have that class gradient
231:19 - and then paste so i'm going to save
231:22 - let's see how it looks like on the
231:23 - browser
231:27 - so now you can see the two columns we
231:29 - have the left which has this
231:31 - gradient and then the right which has
231:33 - this white background
231:36 - next now we are going to add the content
231:38 - so inside the html
231:41 - on the first column we are going to
231:44 - create a class called
231:45 - cta info so this one will be the
231:47 - container for
231:48 - all the content that you're going to put
231:50 - on the first column
231:51 - so we have cta info and then
231:55 - we're going to set the width 200 percent
231:58 - so we have w100
232:03 - so here we're going to start with the
232:06 - content for
232:10 - left column so we have this hundred
232:11 - percent
232:13 - satisfaction guarantee so i'm going to
232:14 - copy that text
232:16 - and then i'm going to start h4 with a
232:18 - class of display four
232:22 - and a class of font-weight bold
232:27 - and then paste that text the next text
232:31 - you're going to add
232:32 - is the paragraph so we have this dummy
232:34 - text
232:36 - so we have paragraph with a class of
232:40 - line height large and then some dummy
232:44 - text so we have lorem
232:46 - 21
232:49 - and then after the paragraph we have
232:51 - this sub heading
232:53 - and then the list
232:57 - so here i'm going to have h3 with a
232:59 - class of display
233:01 - 3 and i'm going to modify that with
233:04 - brief
233:06 - so we're going to style it later and
233:09 - then the text
233:12 - and then from there we need the list so
233:13 - we have ul
233:15 - that is another list with a class of cta
233:19 - info underscore underscore
233:22 - list
233:25 - and then we have the list items so we
233:27 - have the li
233:29 - and then some dummy text lorem ipsum
233:33 - and then here i'm going to say times
233:36 - gray
233:37 - hit tab and now we have the
233:40 - text so i'm going to save let's see how
233:42 - it looks on the browser
233:46 - so now we have the content so here we
233:49 - need to make sure that they reflect what
233:50 - we have here on the
233:52 - layout so i'm going to copy
233:55 - the contents so we have
233:58 - the first list item paste
234:02 - so i've copied all the text or the list
234:05 - items
234:06 - so i'm going to save and check on the
234:07 - browser
234:11 - so now we have that text the next the
234:13 - next step is to style
234:15 - this content so on the sas file
234:19 - that is the get started.css we are going
234:21 - to create that
234:22 - container that is the cta info
234:27 - cta info
234:31 - so remember this is the container for
234:33 - all the content on the left column
234:36 - so we have that city info
234:41 - so here i'm going to set the padding
234:46 - to three ram all sides
234:49 - and then i'm also going to set the
234:50 - margin
234:54 - one ram top and bottom and then zero
234:56 - left and right
234:58 - from there going to style the list
235:03 - so we have underscore underscore list
235:08 - so here i'm going to start by setting
235:10 - the position to relative
235:21 - then i'm going to set the list style
235:24 - type to none
235:31 - and then display we're going to set that
235:33 - to
235:35 - block
235:39 - so i'm going to save let's say from the
235:40 - browser
235:43 - so that is how the content looks like
235:45 - now
235:47 - next i'm going to style the list items
235:50 - from the layout here you can see
235:52 - the list item are using this check icon
235:55 - and here we're going to use the unicode
235:56 - for this
235:57 - check icon so on the sas file you're
236:00 - going to nest it the way you have done
236:01 - on the html so we have the list item
236:03 - inside
236:04 - the class list so we have the li
236:07 - and then content before because the
236:11 - check icon must come before the list
236:13 - items
236:16 - so here you're going to start with the
236:18 - font family and you're going to use
236:21 - the font awesome file free so we have
236:24 - the double quotes
236:26 - and then fonts awesome
236:30 - five free
236:35 - then the contents
236:40 - and just like i said you're going to get
236:41 - the unicode from font or some
236:43 - documentation so
236:45 - we have that cheat sheet that is the
236:47 - front of some cheat sheet
236:51 - so here you're going to search for that
236:53 - icon
236:55 - so i'm just going to type check
236:58 - and then it's going to list for us all
237:00 - the versions of the check icon
237:03 - and you can see here we have that icon
237:05 - and then the unicode so the unicode of
237:07 - that
237:08 - icon is f00c so i'm going to copy that
237:14 - then on the content we're going to add
237:17 - the double quotes
237:19 - and then the backslash and then the
237:21 - unicode
237:22 - like that then we need to set the font
237:26 - to it
237:28 - and here you must set any value from 600
237:31 - and above so i'm going to use 600
237:36 - then i'm going to save let's see from
237:38 - the browser how it looks like
237:42 - and there you have it now you can see we
237:44 - have the check icon on the list items
237:46 - the next step now is to add some padding
237:49 - and some space between the icon
237:51 - and the list items
237:54 - so here i'm going to set margin right
238:00 - so i'm going to use 0.5 ram
238:05 - and then also set the font size
238:11 - so i'm going to use 1.2 ram
238:15 - and then on the list that is the list
238:18 - class
238:20 - i'm going to set paddingtop i'm going to
238:23 - use 0.5
238:24 - ram
238:28 - and then
238:31 - padding left i'm going to use 0.5 also
238:39 - and then some margin at the bottom
238:43 - i'm going to use 0.7 ram
238:47 - so i'm going to save let's see
238:50 - and there you have it now you can see we
238:52 - have some enough space between
238:55 - the content next i'm going to add the
238:58 - content for the second column
238:59 - so from the layout here we have this
239:01 - heading that says start your project
239:03 - and then the form so let's work on that
239:07 - so here just like we did with the first
239:09 - column i'm going to create a container
239:11 - for
239:11 - that content so i'm going to call this
239:12 - container form
239:15 - and then we're going to set the width
239:17 - 200 percent so we have w
239:19 - 100 and then some padding at the bottom
239:22 - so we have padding bottom two
239:26 - so we're going to start with that
239:28 - heading and here we're going to use the
239:30 - same heading that we used on the
239:31 - services
239:32 - so just to show you where we have that
239:34 - heading on the services
239:36 - you can see we have this heading with
239:38 - the background clip
239:39 - so these are two colors so we're going
239:41 - to use the same heading
239:42 - on that part
239:46 - so i'm going to have h4 with a class of
239:49 - display three and you're going to modify
239:52 - that with title
239:54 - and then some margin at the bottom so
239:56 - you have margin bottom
239:58 - five so you have that text
240:01 - which is start your project
240:07 - so i'm going to save let's see from the
240:09 - browser
240:12 - so now you can see we have that heading
240:14 - next let's start the
240:16 - form
240:21 - so before i add the form i must mention
240:23 - that in the new version that is booster
240:25 - version 5
240:25 - they dropped the use of the form group
240:27 - class so here we're going to use
240:29 - one of the utility classes to wrap up
240:31 - our form
240:32 - or the input fields so we have the form
240:36 - and then the action
240:41 - we're going to have that for now and
240:43 - then we have the
240:44 - class row
240:50 - so we have so here we're going to use
240:53 - margin bottom
240:54 - three so you must have that class so
240:58 - mp3 and then the inputs
241:03 - this one is for the first name and we
241:06 - have
241:07 - the type of the input which is text
241:13 - and then we need the placeholder
241:20 - so the placeholder is first name
241:27 - and then you also need the id
241:31 - input first name
241:36 - and then we need the class form control
241:42 - so i'm going to hit tab
241:49 - so here i'm going to duplicate for the
241:52 - last name
241:55 - and then i'm going to change the
241:57 - placeholder to last name
242:00 - and also the inputs
242:07 - and then i'm going also to duplicate
242:08 - again for the email
242:10 - so this one the input type is an email
242:14 - placeholder email
242:18 - address
242:24 - so we have the id input email
242:29 - and then i'm going to duplicate for the
242:31 - message
242:34 - so the type is
242:39 - actually it is not an input it's a text
242:41 - area so i'm going to remove that
242:43 - and then add text area
242:48 - so the name message
242:52 - id message
242:56 - and then you're going to add the class
242:58 - so i'm going to copy this form control
243:02 - and then add it on the text area
243:08 - and here we just only need rows eight
243:11 - so i'm going to set from ten to eight
243:14 - so i'm going to save let's see from the
243:15 - browser how it looks like
243:19 - so this is our form so we need to add
243:22 - some shadow and then make sure that our
243:24 - input feeder large
243:25 - like what we have here on the layout
243:31 - so i'm going to select the class for the
243:34 - four of them
243:36 - and then i'm going to add shadow
243:41 - and then we need also to add another
243:43 - class so i'm going to select
243:49 - and add form control large
243:55 - so this one is from control so i'm going
243:59 - to save let's see
244:02 - so now you can see our form
244:06 - so we need to add the placeholder where
244:08 - we have the message
244:12 - so i'm going to copy
244:24 - save let's see and there you have it
244:28 - the next one let's add the button
244:36 - text center so we have that class
244:40 - and then also going to set the display
244:42 - to grid
244:43 - so we have d grid and then
244:47 - some margin at the top so we have margin
244:49 - top one
244:52 - and then now we need that button so we
244:54 - have
244:55 - button and the type of the button
245:00 - is button
245:03 - and then the class we have btn
245:08 - btn primary
245:15 - and then rounded rounded pill
245:23 - and then we have
245:26 - padding top
245:29 - three and also padding top
245:33 - sorry padding bottom three so we have pb
245:36 - three so so that you can have some space
245:40 - between the content so i'm going to hit
245:42 - sub
245:44 - and then here we're going to add submit
245:49 - so let's see save
245:54 - and there you have it now you can see we
245:55 - have that button
245:58 - next you're going to add the you can see
246:00 - we have an icon
246:02 - so we're going to add that icon
246:06 - so that one should come after the text
246:08 - so we have
246:11 - the icon and then the class font or some
246:14 - solid
246:15 - and then the name of that icon is
246:18 - paper plane
246:23 - save let's say and there you have it
246:29 - next i'm going to style this content
246:32 - so on the get started so here i'm going
246:34 - to start with the comments
246:36 - so we have the form content
246:46 - so we have that class form and here i'm
246:50 - going to set
246:52 - the padding so we have
246:57 - i'm going to set padding to three ram
247:00 - so remember here on the cta info we set
247:03 - that to 3 ram also
247:05 - so i'm going to set that to 3 ram and
247:08 - then you're going to style
247:10 - the button so you have the button inside
247:15 - the form
247:19 - so here i'm going to set the border to
247:21 - none
247:26 - and then we have the color i'm going to
247:29 - use white
247:37 - and then we're going to style any link
247:40 - we're going to start with the color
247:42 - which i'm going to set that to white
247:47 - and then text decoration we're going to
247:50 - set that to none also
247:55 - and then text transform i'm going to set
247:59 - that to capitalize
248:02 - so i'm going to save let's see
248:06 - and there you have it you can see now we
248:07 - have our content
248:10 - next let's make sure that our form looks
248:12 - similar like what we have on the left
248:14 - and that is to have the first name and
248:16 - the last name in one row so here i'm
248:18 - going to create two equal columns which
248:20 - is going to split the two
248:22 - and also make our form fully responsive
248:24 - so let's work on that
248:27 - so remember here we have a class called
248:28 - row that means any column that you put
248:30 - inside the row will be displayed using
248:32 - flex
248:34 - so for the first name and the last name
248:35 - i'm going to select the two classes
248:38 - and then here i'm going to add a column
248:40 - which is going to split the two
248:42 - on large devices only and then on any
248:45 - other device then they're going to go to
248:46 - full width
248:47 - so i'm going to use call lg6
248:51 - and then for the email address and the
248:53 - message i'm going to use
248:55 - call lg 12. that means they'll go full
248:58 - width regardless of the screen width
249:00 - so we have call lg12
249:04 - save so let's see
249:09 - so here you can see already we have the
249:11 - first name and the last name
249:13 - being split into two and this one will
249:15 - only
249:16 - happen on large devices only so i'm
249:18 - going to right click and inspect
249:19 - elements
249:22 - so you can see this one is a device with
249:24 - a screen window of 360 and you can see
249:26 - already the first name and the last name
249:28 - are going full width
249:29 - so it's only on large devices where
249:31 - you're going to have the first name and
249:32 - the last name
249:33 - split into two so i'm going to change to
249:36 - another device and this one will be a
249:37 - medium device like an ipad
249:40 - and this is a screen window of 768 and
249:42 - you can see the input field are going
249:44 - full length
249:45 - we can even do the same way we have done
249:47 - on large devices where we have the first
249:48 - name and the last name
249:50 - split into two so here going to add
249:54 - a column which is going to create that
249:55 - media breakpoint for medium devices
249:57 - so here i'm going to add call md6
250:02 - and then i'm going to save let's see
250:06 - and there you have it you can see now on
250:07 - medium devices
250:09 - we have two columns or two columns for
250:12 - the first name and the last name
250:13 - and they are in the same row
250:16 - so with that i think our form is fully
250:19 - responsive across
250:21 - variety of screen devices
250:26 - welcome back in this video we're going
250:27 - to create section 9 of the layout which
250:30 - is the footer
250:30 - and on the footer we have four parts of
250:32 - the footer we have the top footer
250:34 - which has the contact info we have the
250:36 - mobile email and the location
250:39 - and then we have the social media part
250:41 - and then we have the company info and
250:43 - then at the bottom we have the copyright
250:44 - information
250:46 - so let's get started and create
250:47 - something similar like what we have on
250:48 - the layouts
250:50 - so on the html i'm going to start that
250:51 - section
250:53 - and i'm going to start with a comment as
250:55 - always
250:57 - so we have start
251:00 - section 9 the footer
251:08 - so here i'm going to to start that
251:10 - section so we have footer
251:13 - with a class of footer and a container
251:19 - and then i'm going to hit tab and then
251:22 - you're going to style that
251:23 - class so i'm going to save and then
251:26 - on the sas file for that section which
251:28 - is the footer.sss i'm going to open that
251:30 - file
251:32 - and then the first thing i'm going to do
251:34 - is to use the modules
251:36 - so we have the first one which is the
251:38 - custom
251:42 - so custom and then use it
251:45 - as star
251:48 - then we also have the mixing so we have
251:50 - the use
251:54 - components and then mixing
251:59 - use it as star
252:03 - so here i'm going to style the footer we
252:05 - have that class already
252:08 - and here i'm going to set paddingtop
252:13 - i'm going to set that to one ram
252:17 - then the background color
252:21 - so here we're going to create this color
252:23 - we don't have it on the custom source
252:24 - file
252:26 - so here i'm going to create a variable
252:28 - called footer specifically for that
252:31 - section so i'm going to save and then
252:33 - we need to create this variable on the
252:35 - custom sauce file so i'm going to open
252:37 - that file
252:39 - so this is a new color so i'm going to
252:40 - add it where we have the
252:42 - white and the gray colors let me just
252:45 - add on
252:46 - my theme colors so we have variable
252:51 - footer and then i'm going to assign it
252:54 - this color that is one f151
253:00 - close and then i'm going to save let's
253:04 - see from the browser
253:08 - and there you have it at the bottom here
253:09 - you can see we have that color
253:13 - so we're going to start with the top
253:15 - footer
253:16 - which has this contact info we have the
253:19 - icon
253:20 - the phone the working hours and then
253:25 - we have the email icon the email and
253:27 - then we have the location and the icon
253:30 - so you're going to start with that
253:32 - footer
253:34 - so in the html i'm going to use emmett
253:35 - to generate
253:37 - the three sections at once
253:40 - so here i'm going to start a new row and
253:43 - then i'm going to add
253:44 - the columns so i'm going to group them
253:46 - and here i'm going to use columns that
253:48 - are going to create
253:49 - different breakpoints for medium devices
253:52 - i'm going to use
253:53 - call md4
253:57 - for large devices i'm going to use call
254:00 - lg4
254:02 - and then we need the container for all
254:03 - that content so i'm going to call it
254:05 - contact box
254:08 - then we need some padding at the top so
254:10 - i'm going to add that class padding top
254:12 - one
254:13 - and then we need the container for the
254:15 - icon you can see here
254:17 - from the layout you have the icon the
254:19 - title and the subtitle same way with
254:21 - email and
254:22 - the location so here we're going to use
254:24 - block element modifier to nest it
254:27 - so again we have that class
254:31 - contact box and then underscore
254:34 - underscore icon
254:35 - so that one will be the container for
254:37 - the icon
254:38 - and then we need the container for the
254:40 - title and the subtitle so here i'm going
254:42 - to add a plus
254:43 - and then again contact box
254:47 - and that's called underscore info so the
254:50 - info will have
254:50 - the title and the subtitle then i'm
254:54 - going to add
254:54 - the title so we have the link with the
254:58 - class of contact box
255:01 - underscore underscore info and then i'm
255:04 - going to modify that with
255:05 - title so we have minus minus title
255:11 - and then we have the text so i'm going
255:13 - to have
255:14 - title goes here so we're going to
255:18 - replace that with the actual content
255:20 - for that title and then
255:23 - we need the subheading so here we're
255:25 - going to use paragraph
255:26 - with the class of contact box
255:30 - and that's called underscore info minus
255:34 - minus
255:34 - subtitle
255:38 - so the text we're going to use
255:42 - subtitle
255:45 - goes here again you're going to replace
255:47 - that with the actual contents
255:50 - so here at the end i'm going to say
255:52 - times three
255:53 - and then it's going to generate for us
255:55 - or the three section
255:57 - or the three columns at once with the
255:59 - content so hit tab
256:02 - and now you can see we have the first
256:07 - container that is for the
256:11 - phone or the mobile number and then we
256:13 - have the second one
256:16 - for the email and then the third one for
256:18 - the location so i'm going to comment
256:20 - them so that we can know where they
256:21 - start
256:22 - so we have the first column so it's i'm
256:26 - going to say stats
256:28 - or just content
256:33 - for the phone or for the mobile number
256:42 - and then we have contact for email
256:46 - content for email
256:52 - and then you have the that one which is
256:54 - content
256:56 - for
256:59 - location
257:03 - so i'm going to save let's see how it
257:04 - looks like on the browser
257:09 - so that is our content looks like so far
257:11 - so we're going to style it
257:13 - you can see we have the title goes here
257:14 - for the first one
257:16 - the second one and the third one next
257:18 - i'm going to add the icons
257:20 - from the layout here you can see we have
257:22 - the phone icon
257:24 - for the phone content we have the mail
257:26 - icon for the email content and then we
257:27 - have the location icon for the location
257:29 - content
257:30 - and these are svg icons and i must
257:33 - mention that there are different sources
257:34 - that you can get these
257:35 - svg icons but if you want to use the
257:37 - same icons that have used here then you
257:38 - need to go to
257:39 - tableau icons.com so you're going to
257:42 - start with the first icon which is the
257:43 - phone
257:44 - icon so we're just going to type phone
257:50 - and by doing that you'll be able to see
257:51 - that icon and you can see it here
257:53 - the name of that icon is phone call so
257:56 - i'm going to click it to copy the svg
257:58 - code
257:58 - so click and you can see now it says
258:00 - copied
258:02 - and then on the first column where we
258:05 - have the container for the icon i'm
258:07 - going to paste
258:07 - that code there so paste
258:11 - next we need the icon for the email
258:14 - so again you're going to type or search
258:16 - for that icon
258:18 - so i'm just going to type email
258:22 - and here you can see we have that icon
258:25 - you can see it here mail opened that is
258:27 - the name of that icon so i'm going to
258:29 - click it to copy
258:30 - the code so again where we have the
258:33 - icon
258:38 - that is the content for email we have
258:40 - that container
258:42 - paste the next one is the location icon
258:47 - so i'm going to search for that so again
258:50 - on the table icons i'm going to
258:52 - search for location
258:56 - and by doing that you'll be able to see
258:57 - the icon and you can see it here the
258:59 - name of that icon is map2
259:01 - that is map -2 copy
259:06 - and then on the icon container i'm going
259:09 - to paste
259:12 - so i'm going to save let's see from the
259:13 - browser how it looks like
259:16 - and there you have it you can see now we
259:17 - have the three icons
259:19 - so let's also replace the titles the
259:21 - subtitle with the actual content that we
259:23 - have on the left
259:24 - so let's start with the phone number so
259:26 - i'm going to copy
259:31 - so i'm going to
259:32 - [Music]
259:36 - and then we have the subtitle which is
259:38 - the working hours
259:40 - so let's do the same for the email and
259:44 - the location so copy
259:51 - so i've copied that let's also do the
259:53 - same for the location
260:03 - so i've replaced all the content so i'm
260:05 - going to save let's see
260:09 - and there you have it now you can see we
260:10 - have the actual content
260:12 - so the next step nice to style the
260:14 - content
260:16 - so we already have a sass file for that
260:17 - section which is footer.sss
260:20 - so here you're going to style the
260:22 - contact box which is the container for
260:24 - that content
260:26 - so let's start with the comment which is
260:28 - style
260:29 - the contact box
260:33 - content
260:37 - so we have that class contact box
260:48 - so here i'm going to set the position to
260:52 - relative
260:56 - then you're going to style it the way we
260:57 - have nested on the html
261:00 - so from the html you can see we have
261:01 - this class
261:03 - which is contact box underscore
261:05 - underscore icon
261:06 - and then we have contact box underscore
261:09 - underscore info
261:10 - which has the title and the subtitle
261:13 - so that's how we're going to style it so
261:17 - let's start with the icon we have
261:18 - underscore underscore icon
261:23 - and then another one is
261:26 - info so you have underscore underscore
261:28 - info
261:30 - which you're going to modify the title
261:32 - and the subtitle
261:35 - so for the title we're going to modify
261:38 - that
261:39 - so we have minus minus title
261:44 - and then also for the subtitle
261:47 - minus minus subtitle
261:53 - so here i'm going to start with the
261:54 - width and i'm going to set the width and
261:56 - the stroke
261:56 - that means on the html where we have the
261:58 - three icons
262:00 - we need to remove a few things and one
262:02 - of them is the wind and the height you
262:04 - can see it's already set to 444
262:06 - and also remove the stroke and that is
262:09 - the color
262:10 - of that stroke so let's start with the
262:13 - wind and the height so i'm going to
262:15 - select and then
262:16 - target the three icons so you have the
262:18 - second
262:19 - and then that one backspace
262:23 - and then also the stroke color
262:28 - so we have the stroke color so i'm going
262:30 - to remove it
262:35 - and then for the stroke wind you're
262:36 - going to set that to one so i'm going to
262:38 - remove the five
262:42 - and then save then you can go ahead and
262:45 - set
262:46 - the width of the icon so here i'm going
262:48 - to set the width
262:52 - so i'm going to use 4m
262:56 - and then the stroke
263:02 - i'm going to use primary
263:08 - so i'm going to save let's see from the
263:09 - browser
263:11 - and there you have it you can see now we
263:12 - have the three icons
263:15 - and the color of the icon has changed to
263:18 - purple so next let's style the title and
263:23 - the subtitle so for the info we're going
263:26 - to set the padding
263:30 - so i'm going to set the parting to 0.4
263:33 - ram
263:37 - and then for the title let's start with
263:40 - the color
263:44 - that is white
263:47 - and then text decoration
263:54 - none
263:56 - and then for the subtitle
263:59 - let's set the color
264:03 - so we're going to use one of the gray
264:04 - colors you can see from the layouts
264:08 - we have this gray color so we're going
264:10 - to use one of the gray colors
264:13 - so here we have gray 300
264:18 - so that is the color we're going to use
264:22 - and then we need also to set
264:25 - text decoration to none
264:29 - and also not forgetting the font size of
264:30 - the title and the subtitle so for the
264:33 - title we're going to set
264:36 - the font size to one ram
264:41 - or 1.4
264:45 - and then font size for the subtitle
264:49 - you're going to set that to one ram
264:51 - so i'm going to save let's see
264:56 - so that is how the content looks like i
264:58 - think gray 300 is not the correct
265:00 - color so let's try
265:04 - gray 600
265:07 - save let's see and there you have it
265:11 - so something else is we need to set the
265:13 - font weight
265:14 - of the title and the subtitle you can
265:17 - see they are a bit bold
265:20 - so i'm going to
265:24 - set here for the info so you have font
265:28 - to it
265:31 - i'm going to use 600 save
265:34 - let's see
265:38 - so much better now next i'm going to set
265:41 - the display for this content
265:43 - and this will create different
265:44 - breakpoints so that we can target
265:46 - different screen devices and this will
265:48 - also make our content fully responsive
265:51 - so on the html where we have the three
265:52 - columns i'm going to select the
265:54 - three and then here we're going to add
265:56 - the display
265:57 - utility classes which are going to
265:59 - create different breakpoints
266:01 - so for medium devices i'm going to set
266:03 - the display to block so we have d
266:05 - and then medium and then block
266:08 - for large devices we're going to set the
266:10 - display to flex so we have display
266:12 - large flex and then for small devices
266:16 - you're going to set the display to flex
266:18 - or any other device
266:19 - so you have display flex
266:23 - so i'm going to save let's say from the
266:24 - browser
266:26 - so you can see now the display has
266:28 - changed you can see now on large devices
266:30 - it
266:30 - is using the display flex so i'm going
266:32 - to right click so that we can check
266:34 - for other devices and inspect elements
266:38 - so you can see here these are this one
266:40 - is a medium device it's an ipad with a
266:42 - screen window of 768 you can see
266:45 - the display has set to block so you can
266:48 - see the icon is on top of the title and
266:50 - says the subtitle
266:51 - that means that display is working on
266:54 - that device
266:55 - so let's see from a small device so i'm
266:56 - going to switch device
266:59 - let's go for moto g4 so again here you
267:02 - can see
267:03 - the display is set to flex so i'm going
267:06 - to switch to another device
267:08 - another small device like galaxy s5
267:12 - again you can see the display is set to
267:15 - flex
267:16 - so the only thing you're going to do
267:17 - here is to reduce the for the width of
267:19 - the icons on small devices
267:22 - and medium devices
267:26 - so here i'm going to add a media
267:28 - breakpoint which is going to target
267:29 - large devices only
267:30 - so on the footer where we have that icon
267:35 - i'm going to add the midi breakpoint so
267:37 - we have include
267:41 - media breakpoints
267:46 - up and here you're going to to target
267:49 - from small device
267:52 - and then you're going to set the width
267:53 - to 4m
267:55 - so copy paste then
268:00 - on small device you're going to set that
268:02 - to 2 ram
268:04 - so i'm going to save let's see and now
268:07 - you can see the
268:09 - icons have reduced the size
268:12 - so the next thing is to also reduce the
268:14 - title and the subject on small devices
268:17 - so again here we're going to create
268:18 - create or include a midi breakpoint
268:20 - which is which is going to target large
268:22 - devices
268:23 - so i'm going to copy that media
268:24 - breakpoint and then add it where we have
268:26 - the title
268:29 - so here you're going to set the font
268:31 - size to 1.4 m
268:35 - and then one ram for small devices
268:39 - so this one will also apply to subtitles
268:41 - so i'm also going to copy
268:43 - where we have the subtitle so we need to
268:45 - include that media breakpoint
268:50 - and then where we have
268:53 - large devices are going to have one ram
268:55 - and then we are going to reduce
268:57 - the font size on small devices to weight
268:59 - 0.8
269:01 - and then i'm going to save or 0.9
269:06 - let's see and there you have it you can
269:09 - see now we have
269:11 - the title and the subtitle they're a bit
269:13 - small
269:14 - so let's switch to another device let's
269:16 - go for a medium device we have an ipad
269:20 - so again you can see the content is
269:22 - fully responsive
269:24 - let's go for a large device ipad pro
269:29 - again you can see the content is fully
269:31 - responsive
269:35 - so here i'm going to switch back to a
269:37 - small device
269:39 - and here the only thing i'm going to do
269:41 - is to make sure that the icon and the
269:43 - title are
269:43 - lining together so i'm going to add some
269:46 - padding where we have the icon
269:49 - so we have padding top
269:52 - so i'm going to set the padding top to
269:55 - 0.5
269:56 - ram so save let's see
270:01 - and there you have it i think we need
270:04 - also to
270:05 - reduce the font size of the subtitle so
270:08 - i think
270:09 - 0.9 is a bit large so here i'm going to
270:12 - set to 0.8
270:15 - and then save let's see
270:19 - so now i think everything is perfectly
270:21 - fine so
270:22 - on all devices our content now is fully
270:25 - responsive
270:26 - so we can move on to the next step
270:29 - next i'm going to create the content for
270:31 - the second part of the footer which is
270:33 - the social media
270:34 - so on the html i'm going to create a
270:35 - container for that content
270:39 - so here i'm going to start with a
270:40 - comment which is start
270:43 - the social media content
270:51 - so here i'm going to create a class
270:53 - called footer social media
270:54 - so you have footer dash social media
270:58 - so i'm going to use the two initials
271:03 - and then here going to style the
271:05 - background you can see here we have this
271:07 - light background
271:10 - so i'm going to add an inline style so
271:12 - we have style
271:15 - we have background color
271:18 - and then i'm going to use 21 21 21 so
271:22 - that is the hex value for that color
271:25 - then from there we need a container a
271:26 - row and the two columns you can see here
271:28 - we have
271:30 - the two columns we have the first column
271:31 - with this content that says connect with
271:33 - us on social media
271:34 - and then we have another column for the
271:36 - social icons
271:38 - or for the social media icons so we have
271:41 - a container
271:44 - and a row and then i'm going to add some
271:46 - padding so we have padding y
271:50 - i'm going to set that to 4
271:53 - and then text center so we need to add
271:57 - that class
271:58 - and then tab so here i'm going to create
272:02 - two and equal columns which are going to
272:03 - create
272:04 - different breakpoints so from the left
272:06 - you can see we have the first column
272:08 - which has this text that says connect
272:10 - with us on social media
272:11 - and then we have the second column which
272:13 - has these social media icons
272:16 - so here for large devices i'm going to
272:18 - use call
272:20 - lg5 that is for the first column
272:23 - and then for medium devices i'm going to
272:24 - use call md6
272:28 - and then some margin at the bottom so
272:29 - you need to add that class margin bottom
272:31 - 4 tab and then paste that text
272:38 - then for the second column on large
272:40 - devices i'm going to use call
272:41 - lg 7 so that they make it 12 so we have
272:46 - caller g7 and then color g5 for the
272:48 - first column
272:50 - and for medium devices i'm going to use
272:51 - call md6
272:54 - and then tab
272:58 - so here we're going to start with the
273:00 - facebook icon
273:02 - and then twitter github linkedin and
273:04 - then instagram
273:05 - so we're going to create them in that
273:06 - order
273:08 - so here we have the link and then the
273:10 - icon
273:12 - and then here we're going to use the
273:14 - font awesome brand class
273:16 - and then the name of that icon is
273:18 - facebook
273:21 - and then tab so i'm going to duplicate
273:24 - for
273:25 - the rest of the icons
273:28 - so for the second icon we have twitter
273:33 - that icon we have
273:37 - linkedin sorry we have github
273:45 - and then for the fourth one we have
273:47 - linkedin
273:49 - so we have linkedin
273:52 - and then the fifth one we have
273:56 - instagram
274:00 - so you have instagram and then i'm going
274:02 - to save let's see from the browser
274:06 - and there you have it you can see now we
274:07 - have that text
274:10 - oh sorry those icons but we don't see
274:12 - the text so here we need to add the
274:14 - class
274:15 - text white so here we have the row i'm
274:18 - going to add
274:21 - text white
274:24 - and then save let's see
274:28 - and there you have it so the next step
274:30 - now is to style
274:32 - that content so the footer.css
274:36 - we're going to style that class so at
274:39 - the bottom here i'm going to start with
274:40 - a comment which is
274:41 - style the social media
274:46 - content
274:50 - and then we have that class foota social
274:53 - media
274:56 - so here i'm going to style the links
274:58 - which includes the social media icons
275:00 - so i'm going to set the color to white
275:05 - so we have white
275:09 - then we have the icon
275:13 - inside the link so i'm going to set the
275:14 - font size
275:17 - to one ram which is the default
275:22 - and then some margin at the left
275:25 - to separate the icons we have margin
275:28 - left
275:30 - i'm going to use one ram
275:34 - so i'm going to save let's say from the
275:36 - browser
275:39 - and there you have it so the next step
275:41 - now is to make sure that we create a
275:43 - media
275:44 - or include a media breakpoint which is
275:45 - going to target large devices
275:47 - that is the font size of the icon
275:52 - so first i'm going to open the inspector
275:55 - right click and then inspect element so
275:57 - that you can see
275:59 - how it looks like on other devices so
276:01 - inspect element
276:03 - so here i'm going to include that media
276:05 - breakpoint and i'm going to copy what we
276:06 - have here
276:08 - copy
276:16 - and then here for large devices we're
276:18 - going to use 1.7
276:21 - or 1.6 and then i'm going to save so
276:25 - let's see from the browser
276:27 - so you can see now our content is
276:28 - fitting nicely on a small device
276:30 - screenwind 360. so i'm going to switch
276:33 - to another device
276:34 - like a medium device we have ipad
276:38 - again you can see our content is fitting
276:40 - nicely
276:41 - including the size of the fonts of the
276:44 - social media icons
276:49 - so something else is we need to fix
276:53 - that is the space between at the bottom
276:55 - where we have the
276:56 - social media content
276:59 - so i'm going to close the inspector so
277:02 - you can see here at the bottom we have
277:04 - so a big space so we need to fix that
277:08 - so in html where we have the first
277:10 - column we're going to add a class
277:12 - which is mb md0 so we have that class
277:16 - which is going to fix that so save let's
277:18 - see
277:21 - so now you can see we don't have that
277:22 - space
277:24 - so uh content is fully responsive and
277:26 - now we can move to the next
277:29 - part which is part so on the third part
277:32 - of the footer
277:32 - we have the four columns we have the
277:34 - first column with the company info and
277:36 - then we have the rest
277:37 - of the three with the links so let's
277:39 - work on that so on html i'm going to
277:43 - create a container for that content
277:45 - so we have a comment first which is
277:47 - start
277:50 - the content for company info
277:59 - that is for the company info
278:03 - so that is a comment
278:08 - so here i'm going to start that
278:09 - container
278:12 - which will have a row so we have the row
278:15 - with a class of text white
278:19 - and justify content center so we have
278:22 - that class
278:23 - so justify content center
278:30 - and then some margin at the top so here
278:32 - i'm going to use
278:33 - margin top three and then some padding
278:37 - at the bottom so we have padding bottom
278:40 - three and then tab
278:44 - so inside the row we need the four
278:47 - columns
278:48 - so we're going to start with the first
278:49 - one which is a bit large
278:51 - or a bit big than the rest of the three
278:55 - so that one you're going to to create it
278:57 - separately so we have
279:00 - so we're going to start with the call 12
279:03 - and then for
279:04 - small devices we're going to use call
279:09 - small 6.
279:12 - for large devices you're going to use
279:13 - call lg
279:15 - 6
279:18 - so you have six
279:22 - and then tab
279:27 - so inside the first column you're going
279:29 - to add the
279:31 - heading which is company name and then
279:33 - they
279:34 - info about that company and then this

279:55 - so we have company
279:58 - name then we need that line

280:07 - with a class of bg white
280:13 - and a class of display inline
280:16 - block
280:28 - and then submarine at the bottom so we
280:30 - have margin bottom
280:32 - we're going to use four and then tab
280:37 - and then we need to style it so we have
280:39 - style
280:42 - so we have width i'm going to use 60px
280:49 - and then height
280:52 - so height i'm going to set that to 2px
280:56 - 2 pixels so i'm going to save let's see
281:00 - from the browser how it looks like
281:05 - and there you have it you can see now we
281:06 - have that text
281:10 - so let's also add the text
281:14 - so we have it below the hr so we have
281:17 - paragraph
281:18 - with a class of finite large
281:22 - and then some dummy text so i'm going to
281:23 - use lorem
281:26 - 17 and then save let's see
281:32 - and there you have it so
281:36 - now we have that text i'm going to add
281:38 - the three
281:39 - remaining columns
281:48 - so here i'm going to use call 12
281:53 - and then for small devices i'm going to
281:54 - use call
281:57 - small 6 and then for large devices i'm
282:00 - going to use
282:01 - call large 2 that is called lg2
282:06 - and then some margin at the bottom so we
282:08 - have mb4
282:17 - so at the end here i'm going to say
282:18 - times three because we need three of
282:20 - them
282:20 - so hit tab so for the first column
282:24 - you're going to copy
282:25 - what we have here that is the heading
282:29 - the line the two
282:33 - so i'm going to paste for the three
282:35 - columns
282:38 - paste
282:41 - paste so for the second column we have
282:44 - heading as
282:46 - so let's see from the layout we have
282:49 - products
282:50 - useful links and then contacts so that
282:52 - is the order
282:56 - so we have the second heading so we have
282:58 - products
283:01 - and then useful links
283:08 - and then the that one which is contacts
283:14 - save let's see how it looks like
283:18 - and there you have it you can see now we
283:19 - have the three headings
283:22 - so the next one now is to add the list
283:24 - you can see
283:25 - we have the listing form of the
283:29 - the listing form of the links so let's
283:31 - add also
283:32 - those links
283:37 - so i'm going to start with the links for
283:39 - the products so we have another list
283:41 - with a class of
283:42 - list inline
283:47 - and then we need the list items so we
283:49 - have the li
283:51 - which will have a link inside and then
283:54 - some dummy text
283:55 - so i'm going to use lorem ipsum
284:01 - and then i'm going to hit tab
284:04 - so i'm going to duplicate for the three
284:06 - links
284:07 - so i'm going to duplicate three times so
284:09 - we have one
284:10 - two three so i'm going to save
284:14 - let's see from the browser how it looks
284:15 - like
284:18 - and there you have it you can see now we
284:19 - have the list or the links
284:23 - so let's also copy for the useful links
284:25 - and the contacts
284:26 - so i'm just going to copy the entire
284:28 - anode list
284:30 - to the rest of the columns so for the
284:32 - useful links
284:34 - paste and also for the contacts
284:37 - paste so for these full links you can
284:40 - see we have a different content from the
284:42 - layout here you can see
284:43 - the content is different so i'm going to
284:44 - copy this and then replace with what you
284:46 - have
284:48 - so copy
284:51 - and then i'm going to pause the video
284:53 - and then add them
284:55 - on to useful links
284:58 - so i've copied everything i'm going to
285:00 - save let's see from the browser
285:05 - and there you have it so the next step
285:07 - now is to style that content
285:09 - so here i'm going to start by styling
285:11 - the list items and i'm going to
285:12 - change the color to white and then
285:14 - remove the underline
285:16 - and also have some space to create some
285:18 - space between the list items
285:20 - so let's work on that so
285:24 - on the footer.success at the bottom here
285:26 - i'm going to start with the comment
285:27 - which is
285:28 - style the company info
285:36 - content so that is a comment
285:40 - and here i'm going to create a class
285:41 - which is going to style that list
285:43 - items so i'm going to call it company
285:46 - list
285:48 - so we have company list
285:54 - so i'm going to set the display to block
285:57 - so that is the first thing i'm going to
285:58 - do
286:04 - so you have block
286:07 - and then you're going to set the list
286:10 - style type to none so we have list
286:14 - type
286:18 - so i'm going to set that to none and
286:20 - also
286:21 - we need to set the position to relative
286:29 - then we need to style the list items so
286:32 - we have
286:33 - the ally inside the list style
286:36 - so i'm going to set the margin bottom
286:40 - so i'm going to use 0.5 ram
286:44 - and then text decoration i'm going to
286:47 - set to it
286:48 - to none to remove that underline
286:53 - and then we need also to style the links
286:55 - that are inside the list items
286:58 - so we have the color i'm going to change
287:00 - that to white or set it to white
287:06 - and then also text decoration
287:09 - we need to set that to none
287:14 - so the next thing now is to add this
287:16 - class to the list items that we have on
287:18 - the html
287:20 - so i'm going to select the ul class that
287:22 - is an ordered list
287:24 - for the three so we have the first one
287:27 - second one
287:27 - and the third one and then add that
287:29 - class
287:31 - company list
287:35 - and then i'm going to save let's see
287:37 - save
287:41 - and there you have it you can see now we
287:43 - have the list items
287:45 - so the next thing is to make sure that
287:46 - once you hover the list or the links
287:49 - they turn to our primary color so like
287:52 - what we have here on the layout
287:54 - so you can see from the left once you
287:55 - over the links return to that
287:59 - primary
288:04 - so on the list again we have the company
288:06 - list
288:09 - so we have the hoover
288:13 - and then i'm going to set the color to
288:15 - primary
288:19 - so we have primary and then i'm going to
288:23 - save let's see
288:26 - so now if you try to hover the links
288:28 - you'll see return to that
288:30 - primary
288:33 - so the next thing also is to add some
288:35 - space between
288:37 - the social media content and the company
288:40 - info so you can see we need some
288:41 - enough space or good space like what we
288:43 - have here on the left
288:47 - so here on the html i'm going to add
288:48 - some margin top
288:50 - where we have that container so i'm
288:52 - going to add that
288:53 - class margin top five
288:56 - so that one will fix that and then save
289:01 - and there you have it the next step now
289:03 - is to make sure that our content is
289:04 - fully responsive so i'm going to open
289:06 - the inspector
289:07 - so inspect element so that is how the
289:11 - content
289:11 - looks like on a medium device and that's
289:14 - an ipad screen wind
289:15 - 768 and you can see already the media
289:18 - breakpoint
289:19 - is already working so i'm going to
289:21 - switch to another device
289:23 - this one will be a small device so let's
289:24 - go to moto g4
289:28 - so again here you can see the content is
289:30 - fitting nicely
289:31 - on that screen device so let's switch to
289:35 - another one
289:36 - so let's go for a larger device ipad pro
289:41 - so again here you can see the content is
289:43 - also fitting nicely
289:45 - and it's fully responsive so even
289:48 - without
289:48 - writing a single media breakpoint you
289:50 - can see
289:52 - our columns are already creating the
289:54 - media breakpoints we have created
289:56 - so the only thing i'm going to do is to
289:58 - add the
290:00 - mx auto that is the class for horizontal
290:02 - centering on the columns that we have
290:04 - so i'm going to select all the columns
290:05 - and then add that class
290:07 - so we have the second one the third one
290:10 - and then the fourth one so we have that
290:12 - class mx auto
290:18 - so i'm going to save let's see
290:21 - so with that our content now is fully
290:24 - responsive and you can move on to the
290:25 - next
290:26 - part which is part 4 of the footer
290:29 - that is the bottom footer so on the
290:31 - bottom footer we have the copyright info
290:33 - and this is our fourth part of the
290:35 - footer so let's work on that
290:38 - so on the html i'm going to create a
290:39 - container for that content
290:41 - so let me start with the comment which
290:43 - is start
290:45 - the copyright
290:48 - info
290:54 - so here i'm going to create a class
290:55 - called
290:57 - footer bottom
291:04 - so inside that we need a cloud container
291:07 - so i'm going to create that container
291:12 - and arrow with a class of
291:16 - text center
291:19 - and a glass of text white
291:24 - and then tab
291:28 - so inside that row we need a class or a
291:30 - column so i'm going to use
291:32 - call 12
291:39 - then inside the column i'm going to
291:40 - create another class or another
291:42 - container for the copyright content
291:44 - so we have footer bottom
291:48 - and then underscore underscore
291:54 - copyrights
291:56 - so from the left here we have the
291:58 - copyright symbol
292:00 - and then the text
292:03 - so i'm going to copy the entire text
292:09 - and then you're going to start with that
292:11 - symbol
292:12 - so we have the code copy
292:18 - we have it here
292:22 - and then the text so we have copyright
292:25 - 2021 and then here we need
292:27 - a link so i'm going to create that link
292:36 - and then paste and then here also we
292:40 - need
292:41 - a link
292:46 - and then paste so i'm going to save
292:49 - let's see
292:50 - how it looks like on the browser
292:54 - so now you can see we have the text at
292:56 - the bottom and that is the copyright
292:58 - info
292:58 - so the next thing nice to style that
293:00 - content
293:02 - so on the footer.success i'm going to
293:04 - start by setting the background color
293:06 - for the footer bottom
293:10 - so let's go to that file and then at the
293:13 - bottom here i'm going to start with a
293:14 - comment which is
293:15 - style the copyrights
293:21 - footer or basically content
293:30 - so we have that class footer bottom
293:38 - so here we have the background color
293:44 - and i'm going to use black so we have
293:46 - that color
293:48 - on the sass file
293:52 - and then here i'm going to
293:56 - nest it the way i've done on the html so
293:58 - we have underscore underscore copyright
294:05 - so i'm going to set the color
294:08 - to gray 600 so we have that color
294:14 - gray 600 and then
294:17 - phone to it i'm going to set that to
294:20 - 400.
294:23 - then we need to style the links again
294:25 - inside the copyright
294:28 - so we have a link and i am going to set
294:31 - the color to gray 300.
294:37 - so we have gray 300.
294:45 - and then text decoration
294:49 - we're going to set that to none
294:56 - so i'm going to save let's see from the
294:58 - browser
295:01 - so now that is our copyright so we need
295:04 - to add some padding
295:06 - so on the html where we have that class
295:10 - i'm going to add padding top and padding
295:12 - bottom so we have padding top
295:13 - i'm going to set that to five and then
295:16 - padding bottom
295:17 - also five and then i'm going to save
295:20 - let's see again
295:23 - and there you have it now you can see
295:25 - it's much better
295:26 - so the next thing is to create the
295:28 - hoover
295:30 - so we need the links to turn to our
295:32 - primary color
295:34 - so on the footer inside the link
295:38 - you're going to create that hoover
295:40 - effect
295:42 - so we have hover
295:51 - so the color we're going to set that to
295:55 - primary
295:59 - and then text decoration we're going to
296:01 - set that to underline
296:06 - underline so i'm going to save let's see
296:12 - so now if you try to hover the links
296:13 - you'll see we have that hoover
296:16 - which is our primary color
296:23 - so we need also to make sure that our
296:26 - footer bottom or copyright info is fully
296:28 - responsive so i'm going to right click
296:30 - and inspect elements to see from other
296:32 - devices
296:35 - so that is how the content looks like on
296:38 - a small device
296:39 - which is with a screen window of 360.
296:43 - so i'm going to switch to another device
296:45 - another smaller device pixel 2.
296:49 - again you can see your content is
296:50 - fitting nicely on that device
296:52 - let's go for a medium device
296:56 - again our content is fitting nicely on
296:58 - that screen device
297:04 - so with that we can move on by
297:07 - creating the next item which is
297:11 - the back to top button so you can see it
297:14 - here we have this
297:15 - back to top so on html i'm going to
297:19 - create that
297:20 - button at the end of the footer
297:24 - so here we have a comment first which is
297:27 - back to top
297:31 - button
297:37 - so we're going to create a link so we
297:39 - have the link with a class of shadow
297:43 - and a class of btn primary
297:48 - to give it that purple color and then
297:51 - we need to give it that rounded circle
297:54 - so get what that class which is
297:56 - rounded circle
298:01 - so we have tab
298:07 - and then inside the link we need that
298:09 - icon
298:10 - so you can see here from the left
298:15 - so we have this chevron app icon and
298:18 - that is the font awesome icon
298:20 - so here we have the icon with the class
298:22 - of font or some solid
298:24 - and the name of that icon is chevron app
298:33 - so i'm going to save let's see how it
298:35 - looks like
298:38 - so on the left here at the bottom left
298:39 - you can see we have the icon already so
298:41 - the next thing now is to style it and
298:43 - make sure that you position it
298:45 - at the right bottom
298:50 - so inside the footer
298:56 - so the bottom here i'm going to start
298:57 - with the comment which is style
299:02 - the back top
299:08 - button
299:11 - so here i'm going to create a class
299:12 - which is going to position and style
299:14 - that button
299:15 - so i'm going to call it back to top
299:21 - so i'm going to set the position to
299:22 - fixed that is the first
299:24 - property that i'm going to have
299:27 - so we have fixed and then set the width
299:32 - and the height of that button so we have
299:36 - width
299:38 - i'm going to use the ram and also the
299:41 - height
299:44 - also 3 ram
299:48 - then i'm going to set the position from
299:51 - right so we have right
299:55 - 1.875 ram
299:59 - and also the position from bottom
300:05 - also i'm going to use 1.875
300:09 - ram
300:12 - also we need to set the z index
300:20 - so here i'm going to set a higher number
300:23 - so we have 99999
300:26 - and then i'm going to save and then we
300:29 - need to add this class where we have
300:30 - that
300:31 - button so after the rounded circle
300:35 - paste back to top class and then i'm
300:38 - going to save let's see from the browser
300:44 - and there you have it you can see now we
300:45 - have that rounded button
300:48 - so the next thing is to position this
300:49 - icon
300:51 - at the center of that circle or the
300:53 - rounded circle
300:57 - so here going to nest it we have icon
301:01 - and then we have the color and the font
301:03 - size
301:04 - so i'm going to set first the color
301:12 - so we have color
301:15 - so white and then the font size
301:21 - so the front of the font is i'm going to
301:22 - use one ram
301:26 - and then we need to position at the
301:27 - center so we're going to include that
301:29 - mixing so we have include
301:34 - and the name of that mixing is absolute
301:36 - center

Cleaned transcript:

bootstrap is one of the most popular css frameworks and sas is one of the most popular css preprocessors in this course patrick will teach you how to create a portfolio website using bootstrap 5 and sas hey everyone how you doing thanks for checking out this video my name is patrick from vex accord so in this video we're going to build a multipurpose layout with bootstrap version 5 and sas and the first thing you're going to do is to learn how to set up the sas environment so that can be able to work with sas then you're going to start building the project for a company called patrick's so we're going to start with the navbar which is the topmost part of this layout and then you're going to create a second section called the intro section so here you're going to create a brief introduction about the company and then on the right you're going to create this popup so you have this animated play button and once you click then a video will pop up from youtube or any other source that you choose from they're going to create another section called services so we're going to showcase some of the services our fake company is offering from there going to create another section called testimonials so we're going to showcase what our clients are saying about the company and then from there we're going to create another section called frequently asked questions so here we're going to use bootstrap component called accordion so once you click then the question collapses and reveals the answer from there we're going to create another section for latest work so here going to showcase some of the latest work of a company is has created and then we have these filtering buttons for filtering the categories for the portfolio from there we're going to create another section called get started so this one is similar to what you call call to action so we have this form and then finally we have the bottom part of the layout which is the footer then from there going to make sure that our layout is fully responsive across variety of screen devices so before we get started make sure you have some basic knowledge in html and css so stick around and let's get started welcome back in this video we are going to set up the sas environment and this is to make sure that we have the correct environment for working with sas so the first one is to install node.js it's an open source server environment nodejs allows you to run javascript on the server and it's free and it runs on various platforms so if your machine is not yet installed with node.js you can head over to the office website which is nodejs.org so here on the homepage for those who are using windows we have a download recommended for most users and this one is more than enough for this project alternatively you can also download the current one which has the latest features for other platforms like linux and mac you can check on this link that says downloads so here you need to download the one compatible with your platform or operating system and then once you download then you can install it on your machine and once you install then you need to open your terminal and run node minus minus version and this command will enable you to confirm whether your machine is installed with node.js alternatively you can also use node minus v so you can see mine is installed with version 15.50 it can be different in your case but make sure you see results like this so if you don't see results then it means your your machine is not yet installed with node.js so once you do that then we are ready to move to the next step and that is to create a file called package.json so this is a file which is going to help us manage all the dependencies or the packages that we're going to use on the entire project so first we need to create a folder which is going to keep our project files so on my desktop i'm going to create that folder so new folder and i'm going to call this folder bootstrap minus v5 for version 5 and then i'm going to open that folder and i'm going to open my terminal or terminal inside that project folder so right click open in terminal so i'm using git bash and here you can see now i'm inside my project folder and this is the path to that folder so here i'm going to run a command which is going to initialize the process of creating that file called package.json so that command is npm init for initialize so this one is a stepbystep process of creating that file so hit enter so here you'll see it says this utility will lock you through creating a package.json file it only covers the most common items and tries to guess sensible defaults so the first item here is the package name and you can see it has already assigned the name of that folder which is bootstrap minus v5 that is the name of the folder that you're going to keep all our projects so if you're not comfortable with that name then you can type that name for example let's say you want a name like my project then you can type it there and then hit enter so for me i'm comfortable with that name so that is the name of that package name and then you can also have the option to change the version so i'm comfortable with that description i'm going to write learning bootstrap version 5 with sas the next item entry point test command we're going to put it later git repository later keywords so here you can enter as many keywords as you want separating them with comma or space so i'm going to start with the first keyword which is boost drop space boot strap minus v5 space we have sas space lan bootstrap space and then lan sas so one word so i'm comfortable with those five keywords actually four five sorry and then i'm going to hit enter other that should probably be your name or your company name so i'm going to write my name enter a license and then here the items you need to double check so if you're comfortable then you can hit enter for ok so now we have completed that process and now if you check inside our project folder you'll see we have a file called package.json the next step that i'm going to do is to add or install the packages that you're going to use in our project so we're going to start with the first package which is that sas that's us is a preprocessor it's going to help us compile sas to css and then we're going to install bootstrap of course and then we have font awesome this one is going to help us with the icons and then we have the auto prefixer so the auto prefix is a plugin that saves you the monotony of adding prefixes to your css so let's start with that sas so you can go to this website which is npmjs.org and search for that package alternatively you can also go to github and search for that sas so here on the search bar i'm going to type that hyphen sas and by doing that you'll be able to see the results and we need the result that says a pure device javascript implementation of sas so i'm going to click on that and here you'll see the first thing is this package has been duplicated that means the package has been renamed to sas so earlier it was named as that sas but now it's been renamed to sas so if you scroll down here on the usage there are different ways of installing and using this package depending on your needs and your environment so you can see here you can install it globally using npm install minus gsas which will provide access to the sas executable you can also edit your project by using npm install and because you're using npm then you're going to install it using this command so i'm going to copy that command and then copy and then on the terminal first i'm going to clear and then i'm going to paste enter so by doing that you'll be able to see a new folder on our project folder called node modules which is going to keep all the packages that you're going to install so now as you can see we have that folder and if you look on the terminal you can see it has added 16 packages so let's look again on the node modules that folder you'll see we have that is some folders you can see we have some folders the 16 of them so i'm going to open this project on my vs code and here you'll see we have a new dev dependency on the package.json file so this one is sas version 1.32 0.12 so that is the but by the time i was doing this video it can be different by the time you're watching this video so the next package you're going to install so we have bootstrap so you could go to the official documentation which is getbootstrap.com so on the homepage here you'll see currently version five and then if you scroll down here you'll see the command that you're going to use to install bootstrap so down here we have the installation and here you can see we have that command npm install bootstrap so i'm going to copy that command and then on the terminal i'm going to paste and then i'm going to flag it with minus minus save so this one will save it as a dependency so it has added that package now if you look on the text editor you'll see we have a new dependency called bootstrap version 5. so the next package you're going to install is font awesome so you can go to the official website which is fontosam.com and then down here you need to click on start for free so i'm going to click that and then if you scroll down here you'll see we have npm so i'm going to click on npm and then you'll see version 5.153 so this is the version that we're going to use and then using this package we have different ways of using it and here we have the command for installing it so you can see we have npm installed minus miner save and then the name of that package which is font awesome free so i'm going to copy that command and then on my terminal first i'm going to clear and then i'm going to paste enter so you can see it has added that package now if you check on the text editor you can see we have a new dependency called font awesome version 5.153 the next package that i'm going to install is auto prefixer so you can go to npmjs.com and search for that package so on the search bar i'm going to type auto prefixer and i'm going to click on the first results that says pass css and add vendor prefixes to css rules using values from can i use website so i'm going to click on that and here you'll see we have this autoprefixer post css plugin to pass css and add vendor prefixes to css rules so if you scroll down you'll see we have the command for installing this package so i'm just going to to search for that so i'm going to type install so you can see we have that command so i'm going to copy and then on the terminal i'm going to paste then i'm going to flag it with minus minus save enter so it has added the packages nine to one packages so we check from the text editor you see now we have two new dependencies we have the auto prefix version 10 0.25 and we have post cli post css cli version 8.31 so with that we can start working on our project and we are going to install other packages as the need arises then from there the next step is to create an npm script which is going to compile our sas to css so on the scripts you can see we have a predefined script so i'm going to remove it and then i'm going to write my own so the first option on the script is the name of that script so we have the double quotes and then the name of that script so i'm going to call it compile colon and then sas and here you have the option to give it any keyword or name that you want to use then from there we have the command again we have the double quotes and you're going to start with sas the name of that package that we installed called the datsus and then space and then the source of your sas files so i'm going to create a folder called scss which is going to keep all the sas files and then you have the column and then the destination of where you want to keep your compile css so here i'm going to tell the script to create two folders the first one is the assets and then the second one is css so it's going to get my sas from the sss folder and then it's going to compile and keep that compile css to this folder called css so from there i'm going to save and then i'm going to create this folder called scss so inside the project i'm going to create that folder which is scss so from there we're going to put our script to test so inside the css folder i'm going to create a new sas file and i'm going to call it style dot scss so on the terminal before we write any style i'm going to start that script so on the terminal i'm going to run npm run compile sas so remember the name of that script if you check again on the package.json file you can see we have that the name of that script which is compiled call on sas so that's the script that you need to run on your terminal that is npm run and then the name of that script which is compile sas it can be any name that you've given so from there i'm going to hit enter and by doing that you'll see it has compiled and then terminated the process and then if you check on the project you'll see we have a new folder called assets and say and then inside that's it we have another folder called css and you can see we have the two files we have style.css and then we have a source map and source maps are files that tell browsers or other tools that consume css how that css corresponds to the sas files from which it was generated so they make it possible to see and even edit your sas files in browsers so that means every sas file that we create inside the sss folder is going to generate a source map inside the folder where we keep all the compiled css so for testing purposes i'm going to write some styles on the sas file which is the style.css and then you're going to see how it's going to compile on the style.css so i'm going to open that file which is style.css to the side so that you can see in real time how it's going to compile so before i write any styles i'm going to run the script again and here you can see it has compiled and then it has terminated the process so we need to keep this script running every time that we do changes to the sas file or to that folder called scss so to make it work we're going to modify the script a bit so inside the package to json file we're going to modify the script again and then we're going to add the watch flag so that it can watch for the changes that you're going to do inside that file or inside that folder called scss so here on the script where we have the sas i'm going to create a space and then i'm going to add that flag which is minus minus watch so that flag is going to watch for the changes that you're going to do inside that folder or any for any file inside that folder called sss so i'm going to save and then i'm going to run the script again so now you can see the script has not terminated the process you can see sas is watching for changes you can press ctrl c to stop the script so you can see now it's watching for the changes that you're going to do inside that file so let's do some styles on that sas file and then you're going to see how it's going to compile in real time so here i'm going to create a variable called primary and then i'm going to assign the value or a hex value that is a red color so we have ff and the four zeros and then i'm going to assign it so we have a class called test one i'm going to assign it a color and then i'm going to assign it that primary color so immediately i save you'll see it's going to compile or watch for the changes and then compile it to our style sheet so i'm going to save and as you can see it has compiled and assigned that color so if we check now on the terminal you'll see it has already compiled and it's still watching for the changes that you're going to do so let's change let's change the color let's change to another color so i'm going to assign it a yellow color so we have ff0 and then i'm going to save and as you can see it has already compiled and that means it is watching for the changes that you're going to do inside that file so that means our script is working perfectly fine so and just like i said this one was just for testing purposes so i'm going to remove it and then i'm going to save again as you can see on the style nothing to compile the next step that i'm going to do is to customize bootstrap so here you're going to override some of the bootstrap defaults so that you can achieve the needs that you want on the project i'm going to create a custom source file which is going to keep all the variables that you're going to override in bootstrap and this is because it is not good practice to modify or edit the bootstrap call files so inside the sss folder and this is the folder that we said you're going to keep all the sauce files i'm going to create that file so i'm going to create it as a passion that means it will have an underscore and the underscore lets us know that the file is only a partial and should not be generated into a style sheet so we have the underscore and then custom dot ss so inside this file you're going to do copy some of the variables that you're going to override including the bootstrap itself so before you do the overage you're going to import bootstrap and then you're going to see some of the changes that you're going to do inside this file called demingkit.html so this is the file that you're going to see the changes that you're going to override it has some of the bootstrap components like the navbar which are using some of the primary colors we have things like buttons which are using some of the primary and the secondary colors and then we have things like tables we have borders and then if you scroll down here you have alerts so some of these components are using the bootstrap variables that you're going to override so first let's import the bootstrap and then you're going to link this file with the style sheet so we have the comment which is import bootstrap 5 and then i'm going to import it using the import add rule so you have the imports so we have node modules and then you have bootstrap and then scss and then you have bootstrap.css so this is the mains file or the main booster file which has everything and then close it with a semicolon then from there we're going to import this custom source file to our main sas file which is the style dot ss so i'm going to open that file and then you're going to import it and use it as a module so here we have the use patrol and then custom and then i'm going to close that with a semicolon and then i'm going to save then i'm going to open this style.load css to the side we're going to see how it's going to be compiled in real time as you can see it has already compiled and now this is our style sheet so we're going to link that style sheet to the dimming kit so i'm going to paint that file and then on the head section i'm going to link that stylesheet so we have the assets css and then style.css so remember this file is available in the description if you want to follow along on this part so i'm going to save and then i'm going to go live and check on the browser how it looks like so this is our file the gamingkit.html you can see some of the defaults like the primary color is blue which is being used here on the navbar you can see the navbar is using that primary color as the blue and that is the defaults so we have things like buttons we have a lats we have table border we have both uh button borders so these are some of the things or some of the defaults that you're going to override using this file and you're going to see some of these changes in this file so remember here we're going to do the overrides for the primary color and replace the blue without primary colors which is purple and the pink color then from there going also to do the over it for the accordion button you can see this button you need to replace that with our plus icon so if you scroll down here on the testimonials you can see now you're going to replace this button which is the defaults to the plus and the dash cycle so you can see the default on the bootstrap we have this chevron up and the chevron down so you're going to override some of those defaults and this file is going to help us see some of the changes that you're going to do so the next thing now to do is to copy some of the things that you want to override the colors remember here we have used the blue the blue is the default so we're going to copy them from the bootstrap variables file which can be found inside the node modules and then we have the bootstrap scss and then down here we have the variables file so i'm going to open that so here you can see the primary color is assigned to that blue color as the default so i'm going to start with the gray colors and the white color so i'm going to copy the entire gray white and black colors to my custom so first i'm going to write a comment white and gray colors so then again we need to remove the default flag once you copy you must remove the default flag so i'm going to select all of them and then save so let's copy also the primary so that we can assign it our theme colors the one we have used in our layout so before you copy the primer we need to copy also the purple and the pink colors and that one i'm going to copy them at the top of that file so my theme colors paste and then let's copy also the primary and the secondary color so those are the two colors that we need others can remain as default so here we're going to sign i'll provide color to that purple and then for a secondary color we're going to change that to the pink color so also this one we need to remove the defaults and then i'm going to save we are going to see the real changes so now as you can see our theme they make it has changed the colors so now from blue to purple and also a secondary color from greyhound 900 to the pink so but this is not the color that you have used in our layout so again if you check from our layouts so we have this purple and this pink and these are different hex values so i have them here on my notepad so we're going to assign them to our gray color and our pink color so let's start with the purple and this one i'm going to modify a bit i'm going to call it purple dark because i have two colors so i'm going to duplicate that and then change from dark to light so for the first color i have it here this is my theme color so i'm going to copy paste we have the second color copy paste and then the pink color copy paste and then here we need to assign that color which is purple duck and then i'm going to save let's see the overheads in our naming kit.html so you can see now our dimming kit has reflected the colors that we have changed so these are the colors that are used on our layouts so again if you check here from the layout we need to do another override and that is the accordion buttons for collapsing so you can see here the default is what we have here on the demikit we have this this chevron app and then the chevron done so we need to replace that with our custom buttons which is the plus and the dash circle so just like we did with the colors i'm going to do the overrides for the accordion variable so let's copy that variable to our custom so inside the variables i'm going to search for that accordion variable so i'm going to write accordion and here you'll see we have a number of accordion variables so first i'm going to copy the variables responsible for the colors of the icons and here we have the accordion icon color and another one which is accordion icon active color so these are the two variables responsible for the icon colors so i'm going to copy the two and then inside my custom first i'm going to write a comment so we have the accordion overrides and then for the accordion icon color i'm going i'm going to assign it to our primary color so that is the primary variable and then for the active icon i'm going to assign it our secondary color so that is the secondary variable then we're going to copy another variable which is the variable for the icons so we have the two variables which is the accordion button icon which has this svg icon for the chevron app so if you look properly here you'll see we have the svg code for that chevron app and then for the active icon we have the chevron down so i'm going to copy the two variables and then you're going to replace the icons with the plus icon and the dash circle so inside the custom i'm going to replace and then remove the default flag and then you're going to replace this svg code with the plus icon code so the question is where are we going to get the svg code so there are so many sources that you can get the svg code but i highly recommend that you use the bootstrap icons so you can go to icons.getbootstrap.com so here you're going to search for the icons that you're going to replace with the default which is the chevron app and chevron down so here i'm going to start with the first icon for the chevron app and i'm going to replace that with the plus icon so i'm going to just type plus so here you'll see the different versions of the plus icon and we are only interested with the one with the circle and we have the plus circle so i'm going to click on that icon and here you'll see the different ways of using this icon and you're only interested with the svg code so i'm going to copy the html code for that icon and then i'm going to paste it on my notepad so here we're going to replace the dimension code so i'm going to copy for there you have you can see here we have the two path so i'm going to copy the path for the first dimension or the dimension for the first path and then i'm going to replace the chevron up so where we have the dimension only replace that i'm going to select it and then paste then i'm going to copy the second path the entire path and then again i'm going to paste it here and then you need to remove the double quotes and replace that with a single quote double quote replace that with a single quote i'm going to save that file and then i'm going to check from our dimming kit so here you can see it has already replaced or done the override for that icon you can see now we have the plus circle so let's go ahead and replace the second one which is the chevron down with the dash circle so again just like we did you're going back to the search and you're going to search for that circle or for that circle so here i'm going to type dash circle so we have the dash circle and here we have it so again you have different ways of using this icon we are only interested with html code for that svg so copy again on my notepad so just like we did i'm going to copy the dimension only for the first path and then again i'm going to replace for the second icon which is the chevron down paste and then they copy the second part the entire path and then again here paste remove the double quotes and replace that with a single quote single quote and then save so let's see the overage on our dimming kit and there you have it you can see it has replaced that now we have the dust circle for the active and the plastic for the inactive icon so i think we're done with that part the only thing we can do is just add some we can increase the font size of the icon so again you're going to copy the variables or the variable for that icon so here on the variables file you can see we have that variable for that icon width so i'm going to copy the accordion icon width copy to a custom so i'm going to replace the default which is 1.255 ram with 1.875 ram save check on the browser and there you have it you can see now it has increased the wind of the icon and that is exactly what we have on our layouts so i think we are done with that part welcome back in this video we are going to create the file structure for our project and this is to make sure that we have a code that is well organized and maintainable so i'm going to create all the sas files for the sections and the components so on the sss folder i'm going to create the two folders so the first folder i'm going to keep all the sas files for the sections and the second folder i'm going to keep all the sas files for the components links like buttons make sense and animations and so much more so let's start with the first folder which is the sections folder so inside the sss folder we have the sections and another folder also inside the sss folder and this one we're going to keep all the search files for the components so let's start by creating the sas files for the components and i am going to start with the first one which is the button so apache underscore buttons dot ss so we're going to keep all the code for the buttons on that file another file or another component file and this one we're going to keep all the animations so underscore animations dot scss another file or another component file and this one we're going to keep all the mixins so underscore makesense.css also another source file or another component file and this one you're going to keep all the typography so underscore typography dot ss so i think we're done with the components let's create the sas files for the sections so the first section is the number again underscore navbar.css so that is our first section of the layout so let's see the second section which is the intro section so underscore intro section dot scss let's see the that one so the third one we have this section for the trusted by companies like so i'm going to call it companies so we have underscore companies dot scss so we have the fourth section which is the our services or the services section underscore services dot scss so another section which is the testimonials so underscore testimonials.css another section which is the frequently asked questions so again underscore faq dot scss another section which is the latest work i'm going to call it portfolio and that's called portfolio dot scss another section which is the cts section i'm going to call it get started so underscore get started dot scss and finally we have the last section which is the footer underscore footer.css so the next step now is to import these partials to our main sas file which is the style.css so here i'm going to start with the components and i'm going to write a comment first which is imports the components so we have the use at rule and then the components folder and then you're going to start with the animations and then close it then i'm going to duplicate three times so we have the second component which is the buttons and then the that one which is the make sense and then we have the third one which is the typography so let's do the same for the sections comment first so import the sections so again the use our tool and then we have the sections folder so we're going to start with the number which is the first section of our layouts and then i'm going to close that and then duplicate eight times to total to nine so we have one two three four five six seven eight so the second section we're going to import the intro section we have the that section which is the company's the third one which is the services we have the fifth fifth section which is the testimonials then we have the next section which is so we have the frequently asked questions and then the next section which is the portfolio the next one is the get started and finally we have the last one which is the footer so i'm going to save that file so now this file is going to import all these partials with the code and we are done with that part welcome back in this video we are going to start creating our project and you're going to start with section one of all out which is the navbar so on the number we have a logo which is also known as the nav brand and then we have the menus and here we have a button with a phone number so let's get started and create something similar like what we have on the layout so inside the project i'm going to create a file called index.html and then i'm going to add html starter code using emits so you're going to do a few things on this file the first one is to make sure that you're using the correct viewports and then you're going to add the title and then link it with that style sheet and also add the javascript so let's start with the viewport and we're going to check it from the bootstrap documentation so here on the introduction we have something we call the starter template it says be sure to have your pages set up with the latest design and development standards that means using an html5 doctype and including a viewport meta tag for proper responsive behaviors put it all together and the pages should look like this so here we're going to copy the viewport meta tag and then replace with what we have here on the file so let's add the title and i'm going to write learning bootstrap version 5 with sas then we need also now to link the style sheet so you have the link and then assets folder css and then style.css then from there we're going to link the javascript and here from the documentation you have two options the first option is by using the bootstrap bundle which has the popper and the second option is by using them as separate files that is the popup and the bootstrap javascript so here again you have the option to either link them using the cdn or downloading the source files i've already downloaded the source files and i have them in my project so we have the assets and then we have this folder called js so i'm going to link that file using the bootstrap bundle dot js so below the end of the body i'm going to add the scripts so we have the source so we have the assets folder and then the js and then i'm going to link it with the bootstrap bundle.js so i'm going to save the file so the starter template is ready we can go ahead and create the navbar so i'm going to start with a comment so we have the start the number section so to save time i'm going to copy the code from the bootstrap documentation so here i'm going to go to components and then down here we have the navbar so here i'm going to scroll down till i find the version that i want so i'm going to copy the this code and then i'm going to paste so you can see now here we have a class called container fluid so in booster version 5 a container must be within the navbar and you have the option to either use the the container fluid class or the container class so i'm going to use the container class so i'm going to save that and then you're going to see this page on our browser so i'm going to go live and here we have the navbar so we need to change the color so i'm going to change from bg light to bg primary so there you have it so before we start the number we need to do a few things on it the first one is to add the logo and then push these menus to the right and then make sure that the menus reflect what we have here on the layout so here we are going to start by pushing the menus to the right and here i'm going to add a class called justify content end so i'm going to add that class where we have the collapse class so we have that glass and then you're going to add the logo on the nav brand so you're going to use an image and here i'm going to create a folder called images so you're going to keep that logo inside that folder so we have the images and then the name of that logo which is logo.png and then we have the alt which is the logo image so let's create that folder so inside the projects we have the images then inside my project folder i'm going to copy that logo to my projects or to that folder so i'm going to drag inside my project folder and then i'm going also to drag it to that folder so we can see the results so far on the browser and there you have it you can see the logo and then the menus have been pushed to the right so we need to make sure that they reflect what we have on the layout so we have the home services testimonials frequently asked question portfolio contact and then the button so we have the second menu which is the services we have the that one testimonials so i'm going to duplicate the third one three times so we have the frequently asked question we have portfolio and then we have contacts and then we have that button so i'm going to to remove this one the disabled link so here we before we do that we're going to add the button at the end so we have the button the type of the button is button and then we have the class for that button so for now we're going to use rounded peel to give it that rounded shape we're going to add our own class and then here going to add the telephone number so we have the plus 1 and then 0 2 8 3 6 5 4 1 3. save let's see the result so far so there you have it now we can start styling so here we're going to do the styling on the sas file for this section which is the navbar.css so i'm going to open that file and then here i'm going to create a new class which you're going to add to the navbar i'm going to call this class menu so on the main we're going to create a gradient background so if you check here from the layout you can see here we have a gradient and these are two colors we have the primary on the left that is our primary color and then on the right we have that secondary color or the secondary variable so let's create that gradient so we have the background and then i'm going to use linear gradient so here we need to specify the direction of the color so going to say to write and then we're going to use rgba so we have our first color which is the primary with an opacity of 0.95 then we need the second color again rgba which is our secondary color with an opacity of 0.95 i'm going to save the file make sure the script is running and then add this class to the navbar so i'm going to remove the bg primary and replace with that menu class so i'm going to save let's see the results on the browser so what you're getting is an error for undefined variable and that is because the sas cannot be able to get the modules with the variables so to use mixins or variables of these modules we have to call them using namespaces and by default the namespace is the file name without the extension so here on the navbar we need to call that module which is the custom.css file so this is the module which has all the variables mixins and the bootstrap so here we have the use at rule and then we need to go back to directories so we have the two dots and then we have the custom so here we need to use the namespace and you have two options you can either use it as custom or just plain c so we're going to use it as custom and then close that and then i'm going to save let's see from the browser so still you're getting an error so to fix that we need to remove the namespace so here we're not going to use it with the namespace so we're going to use it as a star so the star tells us to remove the namespaces so i'm going to save let's see and there you have it you can see now it is working so let's continue styling so we need to add the color and do some padding on the menu items or the nav items so here you're going to nest it so we have the li we're going to do some padding so for the top and bottom you're going to put 0 and then left and right 0.7 ram save let's see and there you have it you can see now we have some padding on the nav items so let's change the color to white so we have the links so we have the color so here we need to put white and then some text transform to capitalize and then some font to it you're going to have 600 so save let's see so you can see the menus are bold but the colors has not changed so here we're going to fix that with the important so we have the important on the color so i'm going to save and there you have it so let's create a mixing for this gradient because you're going to use it so many times so i'm going to open that component which is the mixing.css file so here going to copy this gradient so first let's create that mixing so we have the gradient mixing so that is a comment so we have the at mixing and the name of that mixing you're going to call it gradient so let's copy that background gradient so i'm going to cut actually cut and then here we're going to include it and then the name of that mixing is gradient so let's copy that gradient to the mixing so i'm going to save the two files so our gradient should remain intact or our number so here we're getting an error for undefined mixing so here on the mixing we need to include that module so just like we did with the number we need to include that module which is the custom.css file so it should be at the top so we're going to paste and then save let's see so still you're getting an error for undefined mixing this time so we need to also include that module on the navbar so the mixing components so again we have the use at rule and then we have sorry we have the components and then the mixins so again use it as star close save check on the browser and there you have it so without mixing now we can be able to reuse it everywhere we want to use that gradient so the next step now is to work on the button and we need to create something similar like what we have here on the layout so we're going to do that on the sas file for that component which is the buttons dot scss so here i'm going to create a new class which is going to style that button and i'm going to call it btn rounded so i'm going to start by setting the position to relative and then some padding for the top and bottom we're going to set that to 0.9 ram and then left and right 1.25 ram then some font weight i'm going to set that to 500 and then margin i'm going to set that to zero i'm going to save then add that class to the button so we have the rounded pill and then btn rounded so save let's see from the browser and there you have it so we need to remove this dark border and replace that with the white border and then add this rounded circle which has this icon so here we're going to put that icon inside a span so i'm going to create a span and then on the buttons we are going to nest it the way we have done so we have the span inside the bit and rounded span so here i'm going to start by setting the position to absolute absolute and then background color of that rounded circle which is going to be primary then we need to set the width and the height of that rounded circle so we're going to use 2.5 ram we can change that if it's too large or too small and then also for the height 2.5 ram so then from there we're going to add the module they've done here on the navbar we need to include this module so i'm going to copy so remember here we have used this variable so we need to add it there and then save let's see from the browser so you can see now we have a span but that is not the position that you want it we want it inside the button so let's first change the border and then give it that position so for the border we are going to set the border so win the 0.1 ram solid and then the color you're going to use rgba which you're going to set that to white with an opacity of 0.6 then we need to position this span so this one should be closed with a semicolon so for the top set that to 50 percent write 5px then we need to translate y that is transform translate y minus 50 percent so i'm going to save let's see so you can see now at least we have it on the position that you want but we need to make sure that it's rounded and then do some padding on the btn rounded so for the spawn you're going to set the border radius to 50 and then on the bottom so this one should be 2.5 frame so you're going to set the padding for individual side so for the top you're going to leave it that to 0.9375 and then left four points ram and then for the bottom 0.9375 ram the same with the top and then the other one you're going to leave it at 1.25 ram so i'm going to save let's see and there you have it that is our button so now from there we're going to add the phone icon and here we're going to use the font awesome icons so on html you're going to add that icon inside the span so we have the icon and then the class font or some solid and then the name of that icon is phone alt so here you're going to compile the font or some sas file so that you can be able to link that style sheet on the head section so inside the sss folder i'm going to create that sas file so i'm going to call it font awesome dot scss so here you're going to import four files so we have the first one so we have the user tool and then the node modules font awesome and then ss so you're going to start with the brands that is the phontosum for the brands and then close duplicates three times so the second second one we're going to import the regular and then we have the third one which is the font awesome dot css and then finally we have the solid so i'm going to save and then here you can see it has already compiled our font awesome dot css so we need to link that style sheet to the head section so you have the link and then assets css and then fontosum.css so from there now we're going to copy the web fonts to the to our assets folder and the fonts can be found inside the node modules so we're going to copy them from the font awesome folder so here we have that folder so i'm going to copy it to the assets folder so paste so now we'll be able to see our icon so i'm going to the browser and here you can see now we have that icon so the next step is to style that icon so inside the buttons we're going to nest it inside the span just like we have done on the html so we have the icon so the color should be white so we have the white variable and then also we need to position at the center so here you're going just to define or specify the font size or set the font size to one ram and then also the line height so you have the line height which you're going to set that 2.5 frame so let's see save and there you have it so you can see now it is at the center of that circle and that is the position that we want it so let's add the background color for this button to white so on the btn round we are going to add that background color so we have white save let's see and there you have it so the next one now is to make sure that we create the hoover effect as you can see here from the layout so once you hover you'll see that gradients so let's work on that so here on the btn round we are going to create that hoover so we have the hover so the background color so here we're going to call the to use the mixing so we have to include it so include gradients save let's see so we're getting an error for undefined mixing so you need to include that module inside this file so just like we did with the navbar i'm going to copy that module copy paste and now you can see we have that hoover with that gradient so we need to change the color once you hover the button and also this rounded circle so on the hoover we need to set the color to white so we have color which is white so i'm going to save let's see from the browser so now you can see once you hover the button the color turns to white so now let's work on this circle so we need a dark circle once you hover there but the button so the span should be inside the hoover so we have the span and then the background color so we are going to use rgba and they're going to use a dark color so we have the black with an opacity of 0.6 so i'm going to save let's see so if you hover now you can see our circuit turns to dark color and that is exactly what we need so if we check from the layout now you can see the only thing we need to do is bolden the text you can see ours is a bit light so we need to add to increase the font size the font weight so on the b10 round you need to increase the font weight to around 600 or let me have 700 save let's see and there you have it so i think we are done with our parts so the next step now is to make sure that our navbar is fully responsive across variety of screen devices and to do that i'm going to right click and inspect elements so this is how our navbar looks like on moto g4 and this is a device with a screen window of 360. so we click here on the navbar toggler you can be able to reveal the menu so first let's change the color of this navbar toggle to a light color so here we have the class which you're going to change from number light to navbar dark so save let's see and there you have it you can see now it just changed to that light color so something else is we can even hide the button on small devices and that is targeting devices with a screen width of 600 and below or 575 and below so to do that you can either write the media query on the button where we have that btn rounded so bootstrap has some of the mixing that you can use to create a media queries so here we can include that mixing at the top and only hide that button on small devices with a screen window of 600 and below so we have the include that mixing so the mixing is media breakpoint down if you're targeting small devices then you can write down if you're targeting large devices then you can say up so down and then the device we want to target is a small device so you need to use the initials which is sm and then here we need to write what you want to do so the properties we're going to set the display to learn so display none so i'm going to save let's say from the browser so now if you click on the navbar toggler you can't be able to see the button on small devices with a screen device or screen width of 600 and below so to confirm that we need to open our compile css that is the style.css i'm going to open to the side and see that media query so here i'm going to search for that class which is btn rounded so down here you can see that media query it has already compiled so media query marks win 575.98 px and you can see the display is set to none so you can see here any device with a max window 575 the display should be set to none so it will not be able to display that button so let me show you if you're targeting a large device so here we can change the media player breakpoint to media breakpoint up so save let's see the media query and here you can see the media query has changed to minimum width of 7 576. so if you check again from the browser now our button can be able to be seen on small devices but on large devices for example let's go to a large device like an ipad pro and you can see now we can be able to see the button so it depends on what you want to target so again here we need to change that to down because you only want the button to be displayed on large devices only so here targeting a small device to display none so i think we are now our navba is fully responsive and everything is working perfectly fine welcome back in this video we are going to create section 2 of our layout which is the intro section so here you're going to start by creating this intro heading and then on the right you're going to create this illustration and this animated button and also this wavy background so let's get started so on the html let's create that section so here i'm going to start with the comments which is start the intro section so here we have that section with an id of home and a class of intro section which will have a container and the row and i'm going to create the two columns so i'm going to group them we have call md6 and another one called intros so here i'm going to say times 2 to create the two columns so i'm going to hit tab to create them at once so here i'm going to start with the content for the first column and then you're going to style it later so from the left we have this display or heading and then we have description and then the button so for the heading you're going to use h1 with a class of display two display two is a bootstrap heading class and then you're going to start that heading so you're going to use the span with a class of display tool and then you're going to modify that with intro so let me copy the text for the heading or the display copy and then paste and then i'm going to duplicate and then change that modifier to description so let me copy the text paste so let's create the button so here i'm going to copy from the navbar copy paste and then change the content and the icon so the content is get in touch and then the name of that icon is arrow right so this is how our content looks like on the browser so we need to do some styling on that heading in the description so on the typography i'm going to open that sas file so here we're going to use the block element modifier to style the heading and the description so we have that class called the display tool and here going to set the margin bottom to one rem and then text transform i'm going to set that to capitalize then you're going to modify the intro so you have that symbol or the app percent and then the two dash and then intro so we're going to set the display to inline block and then font weights i'm going to set that to 700. so let's do the same also for the description we have that and then the two dashes and then description so if you noticed here on the intro i didn't specify the font size so i wanted to use the display to font size that is available in bootstrap so for the description we're going to set the font size to one ram so we have the font size one ram and then here i'm going to set also the display to block so i'm going to save and then we need also to include the modules so i'm going to copy them from the buttons so i'm going to copy the the first one paste and then save so if you check now from the browser this is how our content looks like so we need to style the intro section so inside the sas file for that section which is the intro section we're going to set the background so first we need to include the two modules so we have the custom module and the mixing so i'm going to copy the two and then paste so we have that class intro section so here we need that gradient so we're going to include that mixing so we have include the name of that mixing is gradient then we need to do some padding so i'm going to use the shorthand and then only specify the top padding which is 10 ram for the rest i'm going to set that to 0 0 0 and then also we need to set the width and the height so for the width 100 height also 100 so i want the contents or the height to scale with the content so i'm going to save let's see from the browser and there you have it so we need to separate the number and the intersection so here we're going to put the shadow so we need some shadow on the navbar so on the html where we have the number i'm going to include that class or to add that class called shadow and another class called fixed stop save let's see so that is how it looks like now so we need to change the colors for the heading and the description so on the typography we are going to set the two colors so we have the color so we're going to use white save let's see so here we need to include or to add the margin top on the description so we have margin top so i'm going to set that to 1.2 ram so save let's see so instead of using these colors here so we're going to set them on the html so i'm going to remove and then set them on the html so here on the row i'm going to add a line item center and then also add that class text white and then i'm going to save let's see so it's still in so the next step now is to create the font style of this heading if you check from the layout you can see the font style is a bit different so here we're going to use the font called poppins which you're going to get it from google fonts so you can go to fonts.google.com and here you're going to search for that font called puppets so i'm going to type poppins and there it is i'm going to click on that link so here you need to select the styles that you want to use and i'm not going to use the italics so i'm going to select and start with the first one which is the regular 400 so i'm going to select it so once you select them they'll be displayed on this viewer and then you need to select the second one which is the medium 500 i'm going to select that style we have semiball 600 select we have the bold 700 i'm going to select that style we have the extra bold 800 select and finally i'm going to select the black 900 so the next step now is to copy the code and paste it on the head section of all layouts so i'm going to copy and then on the html where we have the head section so paste and then from there let's go back to the google fonts and then you need to copy the rules so i'm going to copy that rule css rules to specify formulas and then on the typography we're going to paste it where we want to use that font family so we are going to paste on the display tool and then on the intro and then i'm going to save the two files check on the browser and there you have it so let's increase the font size of the description and also set the text transform to none on the description so here we need to increase the font size to 1.5 and then set the text transform to none i'm going to save let's see and there you have it so for the text for the description we need to add a class for line height so here i'm going to add that class so we have lh base i'm going to use lhbs or lh large so let's see how la the large looks like so i'm going to save check on the browser so line height lag is a bit large so let's use line height base so i'm going to save so i think line height base is a bit better so i think we are done with that part so the next step now is to create the second column from the layout here you can see we have this illustration and this animated play button and once you click the animated button a video will pop up from youtube or any other source that you choose so let's work on that so i will start by copying this illustration to my project and here i have that illustration it's a png so i'm going to copy to my project so inside the images folder i'm going to create another folder called at so this way i'm going to keep all the illustrations and then paste so you can also get this illustration on this website called manypixels.co slash gallery so here you can search for that illustration you can also filter by categories types and also change the color so first let's change the color so here i'm going to use our one of the variables color and i'm going to use the purple light so i'm going to copy the x value copy and then here we need to change that value paste so before you search first make sure that you change the color and then here we're going to search for that illustration and just type coding so if you type that you'll be able to see that illustration and there it is so i'm going to click it so that i can be able to download you can either download it as a svg or a png so either way we'll work so once you do that then we can create that column or that content so inside the html so first you're going to start with the comment so we have this second column and i'm going to stay start the content for the video and then also for the first column start the content for the intro so here going to create a class called videobox which is going to keep all everything so we have videobox and then we have that image so we have the images folder and then ads and then intro section illustration.png and then we have the video illustration so we need also to add that glass for responsive images it's called image fluid so i'm going to save let's see from the browser and there you have it you can see now you have that illustration so let's push it to the right or to the end so here we're going to add a class called on the intros where you have that column you're going to add the text end class to push it to the end i'm going to save let's see and there you have it now you can see it's on the edge or the end so next let's add the play button so we're going to add the play button after the illustration and it will be inside the link so you have the link and then also inside the span so we have the icon and here we're going to use phonto some icons so we have the icon and then the class font or some solid and then the name of that icon is play circle so i'm going to save let's see from the browser so you can see this small icon here so we're going to style it so inside the intro section we're going to do the styling of that file and you're going to nest it the way we've done here on the html so we have the container for the content which is the intros and then we have the video box inside the intros we have the link inside the video box and then we have this pan inside the link and the icon inside the span so that's how you're going to do the nesting so on the intersection we're going to create that class so we have the intros as the container for the content and then we have the video box inside the intros and then we have the link inside the video box and then we have the span inside the link and then we have the icon inside the span so for the video box we are going to set the position to relative and then on the link you're going to set the position to absolute and then here we're going to set the font size on the icon and i'm going to use six ram you can change that later it's too small or too large and then the color i'm going to use a dark color but you're going to change it later so here we're going to use black so i'm going to save let's see there is also found the browser and there you have it you can see now we have that icon and that is not the position that you want to be so we need it at the center of the column or that the illustration so here we can use the bootstrap utilities for positioning that icon and in earlier version of bootstrap we only had a position static position relative position absolute position fixed position sticky in the new version now you can arrange your elements using these properties like the top for the vertical top position we have the stat for the horizontal left position in left to right we have the bottom for the vertical bottom position we have the end for the horizontal right position in left to right you can also just use these other values for the zero for zero edge position fifty for the fifty percentage position hundred four hundred percent edge position so you can see we have those properties here or the classes you can also center your elements using these new classes we have the translate middle and then you also have this applies to transformation translate x for the minus fifty percent and translate way for the minus 50 to the element which in combination with the edge positioning utilities allows you to absolute center and elements so you're going to be using some of these classes to position that icon but for now we need to write our own and here we're going to write it or create a mixing which are going to reuse this code so inside the makesense.css you're going to create that mixer so here is i'm going to start with the comment which is absolutes center so we have the at mixing and i'm going to call it absolute center so here going to set the position to absolute and then top 50 50 percent left also 50 transform translate we have minus 50 percent and then minus 50 percent i'm going to save and then you're going to include this mixing on the link so i'm going to include that mixing absolute center so we have it here close and then i'm going to save so let's see from the browser and there you have it you can see now we have our icon at the center of that column so if you check from the layouts you can see now that is the position that our icon should be so let's change the color to reflect what we have on the layout so here we are going to use secondary save sorry we have the secondary save and there you have it you can see now we have that icon at the position that you want it so this mixing you can reuse it every time that you want to position something at the center that is position absolute so now let's use the bootstrap position utilities to position the icon so we're going to do it on the html so here on the link you're going to add the class and we're going to start with position absolute that is the class and then top 50. and then start 50. and then you need center to center the elements or the icon and you're going to use translate middle so we have it here i'm going to save and then where we have that position absolute you're going to remove it or just comment it so i'm going to save so let's see from the browser and as you can see our icon is still intact at the position that it was previously so next up we are going to create the background wave so from the layout here you can see we have this background wave at the bottom of that section so you're going to do this from the help of this website called getwaves.io so here you're going to make sure that we generate something close or something similar like what we have here on the layouts so you can use these two buttons to change the direction of the wave we have the one facing at the top and the one facing at the bottom here you can change the color and here you can play around with this button to generate random waves till you find the one that you want to use so we're going to change the direction facing the app and then i'm going to do play around with this but until i find the one close or similar to the one we have used here on the layout so i'm going to use this one i'm going to click to get the code so copy svg code and then on the html at the bottom of that section i'm going to paste and then i'm going to change this color from blue to white so hex value for white is fff or 6f and then i'm going to save check on the browser and there you have it now we have that background wave so the next step now is to animate this icon from the layout you can see the play button is animated so let's work on that so on the intro section we're going to create a class called border animation so here you're going to set the position to obsolete obsolete and then you're going to set the width and the height and you're going to use the same size we used on the fonts on that icon sorry which is six ram so we have the width we have 6 ram same with height 6 ram then we need the border we're going to start with the width which i'm going to set to 0.55 frame solid color i'm going to use white so i'm going to save and then you're going to add this class to the html where we want that border to be so i'm going to create a span with a class of border animation class so i'm going to save let's see from the browser so you can see this border so let me change the color to be able to see it properly so i'm going to change from white to black save let's see so you can see this border so we need to change the color sorry we need to make it round so we need to change the border radius or set the border radius to 50 percent so we have border radius 50 save let's see and there you have it so the next thing now is to position it to where we have this icon because it must be in that position same position with the icon so that can be able to animate position that you're going to set the top position to zero and also the left position to zero so we have left zero so i'm going to save let's see from the browser and there you have it now it is at the position where we have that icon so next i'm going to create an animation which is going to animate that border so inside the animations.css we're going to create an animation called pulse so i'm going to start with the comment which is pulse border so here we have the keyframes and i'm going to call it pulse border so from zero percent we are going to scale it from one so we have transform and then scale it one scale it one and then two hundred percent we're going to scale it to 1.5 so we have scale 1.5 then you're going to add this animation to our animation border class so animation name we have that pulse border it's going to last for one second linear infinite so you have linear infinite so i'm going to save let's see from the browser so you can see now animation is already working so we're going to create two animations so here on the html we're going to duplicate and then here going to modify that animation so we have the first border minus minus border one so here you're going to set the two borders with a different animation delay so we have animation delay for the first border which is going to last for one second and then for the second border minus minus border two animation delay so you have this animation delay 1.2 seconds so even this one should be animation delay not animation animation delay so i'm going to save then on the html we need to nest it there we have done so here we're going to add for the first one we have border animation minus minus border one so i'm going to copy that to the second border so this one should be border two so i'm going to save let's see from the browser so we can't be able to see the border so what you're going to do here on the animation you're going to set the opacity for the first from zero we're going to set the opacity to one and then on the hundred percent we're going to set opacity to zero so you have opacity one i'm going to copy and then this one will be 0 200 so i'm going to save let's see so now you can see we have the two borders so we need to change the delay animation delay so here on the intro section we need to change from 1.2 to 1.5 and then also this one should last for 1.5 so i'm going to save let's see and there you have it you can see now the two borders so let's change the color to white on the border save let's see and now as you can see that is our animation so if you check from the layout you can see we have achieved the same results and i think we are done with that part so the next thing is to create the video popup you can see from the layout once you click this animated play button a video will pop up from youtube or any other source that you choose it can even be a selfhosted video so to create that you're going to use a free javascript lightbox called g lightbox from brt digital so you can go to github and search for this brt digital or just g lightbox alternatively you can also go to npmjs and search for that package called g lightbox so here you see it says deletebox is a pure javascript lightbox it can display images iframes inline contents and videos with optional autoplay for youtube vimeo and even self hosted videos so you can see it has some good features it's fast and responsive that means it can work with any screen size we have the gallery support you can create multiple galleries we have video support for youtube vimeo and selfhosted videos with autoplay we have support for inline content iframe support keyboard navigation touch navigation zoomable images api that means you can control the light box with the provided methods and also it's dimmable that means you can create your skin or modify the animation with some minor css changes then on the usage we have different ways of using this lightbox you can install it using npm and you can also manually download the source files and then link the javascript in your html so i'm going to go with the second option that is to download the source files and then i'm going to link the javascript and the style sheet in my html i have downloaded the source files so i'm just going to copy the source files to my projects so here we have this folder called g lightbox master and this is the folder which has all the source files so inside that folder we have another folder called list and this is the folder which has the files that you're going to use so if you open that file you'll see we have the css folder which has the style sheet and we have the two versions and then also we have the js folder which has the javascript and again we have the two versions so i'm just going to copy the two folders to my projects so copy and then inside my projects so i'm going to keep them inside the assets folder and then inside their search folder i'm going to create another folder and i'm going to call it vendors so here i'm going to keep all the source files for vendors so we have vendors then inside that folder i'm going to paste so then from there now we're going to link the two files to the on the html so let's start with the javascripts and they're going to link link it at the bottom so here we have the scripts and then we have the source so we have the assets folder and then vendors and then js so you can use any of the two options i'm going to use the minified version and then we need also to link the style sheets on the head section so we have link and then we have the assets folder vendor and then css and again i'm going to use the minified version then from there we're going to set the lightbox options for the video you can see here we have the light box options and we have the options for the image and you can see the type is an image and then we have the options for the video and you can see the type is a video so here we have the link which is an option you need to set the link and then you have the type whether it's an image or video and then the source here you need to specify the source either from youtube female or selfhosted video and then we have the width you can also set the autoplay videos to true first you need to declare using the const keyword so i'm going to copy that declaration and then at the bottom we need to create another script immediately below the lightbox javascript so we have the script and the type is text javascript and then i'm going to paste so here you need to remove the touch navigation loop and the auto play videos and then you're going to replace that with the options that we have for the video so i'm going to copy just to save time and then we need to replace the link for the video so here i'm going to copy from one of my videos i have on youtube so you have two options you can either copy the url of the video or just click on this link that says here then you can copy the link so i'm going to replace that and then paste and then from there we need to add the g lightbox class where we have that animated play button so we have g lightbox so you need to add that class and then i'm going to save so let's see from the browser so now if you click the animated play button you'll be able to see the popup from youtube so you can see now we have that popup from youtube so here remember you can also set the auto play videos to true so you need to add that option so we have auto play videos we have true and then i'm going to save let's see again so now if you click again you'll be able to see the autoplay videos working and there you have it so in this video we're going to build a mod and the good thing about that lightbox you can see it's fully responsive and this one is a screen device with a screen window 316 you can see it's fully responsive so i'm going to switch to another device like a medium device and again you can see our our light box or the popup is fully responsive so with that we are so with that we are done with that part so the next thing nice to make sure that our section is fully responsive across variety of screen devices and to do that i'm going to right click and inspect elements so before you write any media query or do anything we're going to see how our sections look like on various devices so this one is moto g4 it's a device with a screen window of 360. and the content is not bad so here we can decrease the font size a bit for the description so let's see from another device like pixel 2. here the content is not that bad what about iphone x not good ipad not good so what about surface duo not bad iphone 678 plus i think not bad but here we can decrease the font size of the description a bit so to make this work we are going to on the typography where we have the description we are going to decrease the font size for small devices that is any device with the screen width of 600 and below we're going to set the font size or decrease the font size so here we're going to focus first on mobile devices so we're going to set the font size to one ram and then here i'm going to write a media query which is going to target large devices so we have that mixing so include media breakpoint up so from large so you have to use those initials lg for large devices and then we are going to set the font size to 1.5 frame also we're going to set the display to inline block so here the display we're going to set that to inline block so i'm going to save and look at the content again so now you can see on this device which is an iphone 6 plus the description is a bit small and that is what i wanted so let's see from another device like moto g4 still the same so what about an ipad as you can see the section is good on that device so let's see from an ipad pro and there you can see now the font size of that description is a bit big so it can even decrease to 1.4 m so let me decrease to 1.4 save let's see yeah now you can see the content is not bad perfect so let me go back to moto g4 perfect pixel 2 perfect surface duo perfect iphone 5s e i think we need to target i think it's all bad so with that i think our section is fully responsive and we can move on welcome back in this video we are going to create section 3 of our layout which is the companies so let's get started and create something similar like what we have here on the layout so on the html we're going to start that section so i'm going to start with a comment start the companies so here we have that section with a class with an id of companies and a class of companies it will have a container and a row so here we're going to start with that heading we have trusted by companies like so i'm going to copy so here we have h4 with a class of fontweight bold and a glass of lead and some margin so i'm going to use mp3 margin bottom three and then the text tab and there you have it so i'm going to save so let's see from the browser result so far so this is our text so we need it at the center so i'm going to add on the row text center class so we have the text center save let's see and there you have it you can see we have our text at the center next i'm going to add the heading line from the layout here you can see we have a line below the heading or the display and actually these are two lines so we have the first line which is content before and the second line which is content after so let's work on that so on typography i'm going to add that class first i'm going to start with a comment which is heading line the class i'm going to call it heading line so this one is for the first line so we have content before and then we have the contents and then i'm going to set the width for the first line to 10 ram and then the height i'm going to set that to 0.1 ram then i'm going to set the display to block then some background color i'm going to use primary and then i'm going to duplicate this class for the content after so duplicate and then here we need after so this one is for the second line or the line below the first line so i'm going to save and then you're going to add that class below the heading and then i'm going to save let's see from the browser so we have the lines let me add some margins so that you can be able to see it properly so we have margin bottom five save let's see so now you can see we have our first line so because they are having the same width so i'm going to change for the second which i'm going to set to to ram and then for the width height i'm going to set that to 0.2 save let's see and now you can see we have the line the first one and the second one so here we need to set some margin so for the second line i'm going to set some padding at the top so we have padding top i'm going to use 0.5 ram and then i'm going to save let's see so now you can see we have the two lines the second one is a bit has a higher height than the first one so we need them at the center so here we're going to add so i'm going to select the two and then add the margin that is set the margin to zero outer for horizontal centering and then i'm going to save let's see and there you have it now you can see we have our line at the center so for the second line i'm going to add some margin at the bottom margin bottom to one rem save let's see and there you have it next i'm going to add the images or these logos to my project so we have the six logos so here i have a folder called companies you can see the logos are named company one all the way to company six so i'm going to copy the entire folder to my project so copy so i'm going to copy them inside the images folder so on the html you're going to create that content and i'm going to create another container so here we're going to start with a comment which is start the company's content so we have a container class which will have a row and then i'm going to create the six columns which will have the logos so here i'm going to group them so i'm going to use call md4 and then another class or another container for the logos i'm going to call it companies then i'm going to use block element modifier to style that logos so we have the companies and then underscore underscore logo box then we need the images so we have the image and then the source of the images we have the images folder and then the companies folder which have the logos so if you check here again from the folder you'll see the company logos are named company one all the way to company six and they are in png so here we have to write that company minus dollar sign to assign each value and then dot png then we need an alt which will be company dollar sign logo then we need the title so the title will be company again dollar sign logo then we need a class called image fluid for responsive images so we have image fluid so here i'm going to say time 6 to generate the six columns with the content at once hit tab and there you have it you can see now we have the six columns with the contents so let me arrange them properly here and then i'm going to save let's see from the browser so now we have our logos the next step now is to style them so inside the companies.css file that is the sas file for that section so i'm going to open that and you're going to start by styling this class called companies because this is the container for the content on that section so we have the class companies so here i'm going to start by setting the padding sorry not padding top but padding you're going to use the shorthand for the top zero and then zero and then for the bottom you're going to set that to five frame and then zero for the left and then here we have the companies sorry we have this class remember how we have nested them we have the companies and then underscore underscore logo box so that's how you're going to nest it so we have my underscore underscore logo box because the logo box is the parent container of all the logos that is the images you can see here we have the logo box and then the images so here going to set the width so we have we are going to use max width we're going to set that 200 percent then we're going to set the height so here i'm going to use three ram you can change that then you're going to style the image so here again only to set the height so that it can scale to 3 ram so i'm going to set the height 200 percents so i'm going to save let's see from the browser and there you have it you can see now we have the images of scaled to the window of the column and the height of that which is rhythm so let's continue styling here so here i'm going to add some margin at the bottom i'm going to use two ram and then we need some padding i'm going to use 0.5 ram and then we have text align center and then not forgetting you to set the position to relative i'm going to save let's say from the browser and there you have it now you can see they have scaled so we need to add some shadow on the columns you can see from the layout here we need some shadow so on the html i'm going to select all the classes the logo box and then i'm going to add the shadow small so we have that glass shadow small so i'm going to save let's see and now as you can see we have the shadow so the next step knows to make sure that our section is fully responsive across variety of screen devices so i'm going to right click and inspect elements so you can see this one is moto g4 a screen window of 360 and the logos are screen scaling and fitting nicely in one column so i'm going to check it from another device like an ipad and you can see these are an ipad a screen window of 768 and they're fitting nicely in three columns so i'm going to check it from another device larger than that so we have ipad pro and you can see also they are fitting nicely but here we have so much space that they can fit in one line so to fix that i'm going to add another color for target large devices so i'm going to select all the columns or the classes and then i'm going to add that class or that column that is called lg2 so i'm going to save save let's see so now they are fitting in one line so i'm going to change their screen width and here you can see again they're fitting in nicely in one line so i'm going to close the inspector and as you can see we have the logos fitting nicely in one line as we what we have here on the layout so the next thing is to make sure that once you hover the logos they turn to grayscale so let's create that hover effect so on the companies where we have the image we have the hoover so we have the filter property and then grayscale so i'm going to set that to 120 save let's see so now if you try to hover the logos you see they're turning to grayscale so i think we're done with that part we can move on to the next step welcome back in this video we are going to create section 4 of the layout which is the services or our services so let's get started and make sure that we create something similar like what you have here on the layout so on the html i'm going to start that section first i'm going to start with a comment which is start section 4. the services so we have the section with an id of services and a class of our services which will have the container and the row so i'm going to hit tab so we are going to start with that heading so we have the our services and then this heading line copy so this one is h1 with a class of display 3 and a class of fontweight bold so i'm going to tab i'm going to save then we need that heading line so we have the class heading line and some margin at the bottom so mb5 so i'm going to save let's see so we have the heading so we need it at the center so here we're going to add the text center class so we have the text center i'm going to save let's see and there you have it so next we are going to create the font style of this heading so we're going to do the same way we did with display 2 on the introduction so we're going to add that font family called poppins so on typography we're going to create that display 3. so first is a comment which is display three and then you have that class display three so here i'm going to copy the font family from display too so copy and then you're going to paste save let's see and there you have it you can see now the heading is using that font family called poppins next we are going to create the two columns which have the two description and the border at the center so let's work on that so here i'm going to create another container for that content so i'm going to start with a comment which is start the description content so you have a container class which will have a row and the row will have some padding at the top so i'm going to use padding top three sorry two and some padding at the bottom so we have padding bottom two and then some margin at the top five and then some margin at the bottom so m b three and then we need the two columns so i'm going to group them so i'm going to use call md6 and then i'm going to say times two to create the two at once hit tab so i'm going to start with the description for the first column so here we have a class called bg white and some padding so i'm going to use p3 tab and then h2 with a class of fontweight bold and a class of text capitalize and the class of text center so i'm going to copy the text from the layouts copy paste then for the second column the description for the second column again we have bg white and a class of some padding so we're going to use b4 and then a class of text stats to align it at the left then you're going to create a paragraph with a class of fontweight lights and a class of text stats but you already have it on the bg head so i'm going to hit tab and then i'm going to copy that text from the layout paste i'm going to save let's see from the browser so there we have now our two description so the next thing now is to add this border at the center of the two columns so here i'm going to create a class called boulder right so in the first column i'm going to add that class which you're going to style it we have border right and then inside the typography we're going to style it let's start with the comment which is border right and then the class is buddha rights so we have that property boda right and i'm going to set the width to 0.1 ram solid and i'm going to use gray 300. and then here i'm going to set the height to 100 so we have the height 100 percent so i'm going to save let's see from the browser and there you have it you can see now we have that border at the center of the two description next i'm going to create the three content for the services so from the layout here we have marketing web development and cloud hosting so for each service we have an icon heading text button and then an illustration same way with the second and the third one so let's work on that so here i'm going to start another container for that content so first you're going to start with the comment which is start the content for the services so here you're going to generate the three sections at once using emits so you can see here from the layout you have the two sections we have the first section which are the content and then on the right we have an illustration same way with the second and the dad so here we have a container and then we have a row so i'm going to group it the row will have two columns each so i'm going again to group them so we have for large devices you're going to use call lg6 and then for medium devices we're going to use call md6 and then for small devices you're going to use call small 12 and then for extra small you're going to use call extra small 12 and then we needed another container for the content so i'm going to call it services then we need margin at the top so i'm going to use margin top 4 then from there we need now the container for the content that is the text so we have i'm going to call it services here we're going to use block element modifier underscore underscore contents so for the columns i'm going to say times two so that we have two columns for each row and then you're going to create the three rows or the three sections so i'm going to say times three so that means for each row we'll have two columns each so i'm going to hit tab and then it's going to generate for us all the three sections so you can see now we have the first row having the two columns the second row having the two columns for web development and then the that row or the that section having the two columns for cloud hosting so i'm going to comment them so that we can know where they start so we have start the marketing content tab so we have the second one so start the web development content and then finally the that one which is start the cloud hosting content so i'm going to start with the content for marketing and we have that content on the first column so here i'm going to add the content and then i'm going to style it later so we have the icon and then the heading and then the text and then this button and then on the second column we have this illustration so let's work on that so here i'm going to create a class called icon which is going to style that icon and then you're going to add that icon so we have the font or some solid class and then the name of that icon is paper plane tab then the second item is the heading so we have h3 with a class of display three so here i'm going to use block element modifier to style it so we have display three and and then minus minus title then i'm going to add some margin at the top so we have margin top one tab and then the heading is marketing that item is the text so we are going to have a paragraph with a class of line height large so here going to add some dummy text so we have lorem 28 then you we have the button so here you're going to copy the button from the intro section so i'm going to scroll up and then copy the button so we have and then here i'm going to change the text to learn more so i'm going to save let's see how it looks like on the browser so far so this is our content so here going to add the border primary to the button so i'm going to add that class so we have border primary save let's see and there you have it so now we can go ahead and copy this content to the rest of the two sections so i'm going to copy the icon the heading the paragraph and the button so for the second column which is web development we have that content on the second column so i'm going to paste it on the second column and then for cloud hosting we have that content on the first column paste then i'm going to change the heading to cloud hosting and then also change the icon so that icon is called cloud upload alt and then we have web development and also going to change the icon to code so i'm going to save so let's see from the browser and these are our content looks like so we have marketing that is the content for marketing web development and cloud hosting next i'm going to add the illustrations and they already have them so i have a folder called services which has the three illustrations in png so i'm just going to copy the entire folder to my project so inside the services i'm going to paste so now we can go ahead now and add the illustrations so let's start with the marketing so for the first row we have the illustration on the second column so here we have an image with a class of image fluid and then we have an alt we have marketing illustration tab so we have the images folder which is the source and then the services and then service one dot png that is for marketing so i'm just going to copy this to web development so that we have the illustration on the first column paste and then you're going to change the value to service to and then change also the alt to web development i'll do the same to the third one which is cloud hosting so we have it on the second column paste change the value to service 3 and also the alt which is cloud hosting illustration so i'm going to save let's see from the browser and there you have it now we have the three illustrations so the next step now is to style the content and you're going to do that on the sas file for that section which is the services.css so here i'm going to start with the container for the content which is the services class and then we need to do some correction on the html so at the beginning of that section we created a class called our services so let's rename that to just services and then save so on this container we're going to set to start by setting the position to relative and then some padding i'm going to use the shorthand top and bottom you're going to use one ram and then for left and right zero and then you're going to nested the web done on the html so we have this class called services underscore underscore content and then we have the icon inside the content so that's how we're going to nest it so we have underscore underscore content inside the services so here again we're going to save the padding for the contents to one ram all sides then some margin at the top i'm going to use 1.5 ram and then we need to style the icon so we have that icon class inside the content so for the font size we're going to set that to 2.5 ram you can change that letter if it's too big or too small and then the color we have primary so i'm going to save and then we need to use the module at the top so we have the use at rule and then custom so use it as star save let's see from the browser result so far and there you have it so we have our icon with a font size of five 2.5 next we're going to style the heading so if you check here from the layout you can see the heading is as if it says two colors so we have some purple at the left and then on the right we have this pinkish color so here we're going to use background clipping so on typography we are going to style it the way we have done the html again so you can see we have display three so we're going to modify that display three so if you check again from the html here just to show you where we have the heading we have displayed three class and then minus minus title so you're going to modify it that we have done there so we have minus minus title so here i'm going to start with the font size i'm going to set that to 1.8 ram then text transform we're going to set that to capitalize and then font wait i'm going to use 600 and then the font family so again to copy what we have here and then set the display to inline block so we have that background clip we're going to clip text so before we set the background clip we need to the background color so we have the background image we're going to use linear gradient because we need the two colors so the direction of the color is two right and then we have the first color primary second color secondary then we need to clip the text so here you're going to use a property called webkit text field color so we have webkit text field color and you're going to use transparent so i'm going to save let's see from the browser so here we need to set for the webkit background clip check on the browser and there you have it you can see now it has clipped that background color so here we need to set the display on the html to block so that they can be on separate lines so the html where we have the icon you're going to set the display to block so i'm going to select the three icon classes and then display block save let's see and there you have it so something else on the html we need to put to push the illustrations on the edge so we're going to select the second sorry the first one which is the marketing so we have that illustration we're going to add that class called text end where we have the column so we have the text end to push it to the edge and then for the web development you're going to also do the same on the illustration where we have that class sorry the column so we have the text stats and then also for the cloud hosting we have that illustration so we're going to set that to text end save let's see so now you can see the illustration have been pushed to the start and the end so something else is we need to do some correction on where we have the illustration so on the html let's start with the marketing so here we have that class called services underscore underscore content we need to change that to pick so that it represents the the illustration so let's do the same also for the second that is web development we're going to replace that with services underscore underscopic for picture and also the that one which is the cloud hosting i'm going to change that to pic then on the sass file we need to nest it that way we have done so we have underscore underscore peak so here you're going to set the max width to 100 and then for the content we need to change the margin top to five ram so i'm going to save let's say from the browser so that is how our content looks like much better now next you're going to make sure that our section is fully responsive so i'm going to right click and inspect elements so this is how the section look like on moto g4 that's our device with a screen window of 360. so you can see we have so much or big spaces between the contents so for the first one which is the space between the heading and the first description and this has to do with margin so let's go to the html so where we have the heading line you're going to change the margin bottom from mb5 to mb 1 and then save let's see so you can see now the space has reduced a bit again also here we have the margin top where we have the first description let's change the margin top to zero save let's see so you can see now the space is much better the next one is the space between the second description and marketing so this is the content for the services so let's see from the html so again here you can see we have so many containers we have a container for the heading we have another container for the two description and another container for the services so let's remove the container where we have the description so so that they can share the container with the heading so let's remove this one and also this container so i'm going to save let's see so now the content is running nicely so the next one is the space between you can see here we have this space but still so here we're going to write a media breakpoint which is going to target large devices so on the sas file where we have the content we have margin top so here i'm going to create a media breakpoint which is going to target large devices we have that mixing include media breakpoint up so that is from large devices large so here i'm going to copy the margin top so we're going to set that to 5 ram and then the default you're going to set that to zero so i'm going to save let's see so you can see that one has already fixed that the next one is to work on the icon and the heading again here going to write another media breakpoint where we have the icon and the font size on typography so i'm going to copy this media breakpoint and use it where we have the icon so here on large devices you're going to set that to 2.5 and then the default you're going to set that to 1.5 again on typography let's go to typography i have display three so let's copy that video breakpoint copy so here we're going to set the font size to 1.5 1.8 1.8 and then for other devices it's going to remain to 0 to 1 ram and then i'm going to save let's see now so you can see that has already fixed that you can see the the icon and the heading they're a bit small now on small devices so i'm going to change another device larger than that let's see from an ipad also you can see the font size of the heading and the icon a bit small now so you can even reduce the font size of the text yeah let's do that so on the services inside the contents we have the paragraph that is the p font size so the default you're going to set that to 0.8 ram and then you're going to write another media breakpoint so here we are going to set that to one ram one ram that will target only the large devices so i'm going to save let's see so you can see now much much better i think we can increase the font size of the heading so let's set that to 1.1 or 1.2 save let's see so i think now everything is much better so let's change to another device ipad pro that's a large device so you can see the contents is nicely fitting moto g4 again you can see the content is nicely fitting on that screen device so that means our section is fully fully responsive and you can move on to the next section welcome back in this video we are going to create section 5 of the layout which is the testimonials so here we are going to use bootstrap component called carousel so let's get started and create something similar like what you have on the layout so on the html we are going to start that section so first we are going to write a comment which is

zero and then we need that gradient color so here going to include that mixing so we have the include the name of that mixing is gradient so i'm going to save let's see how the section look like so this is how the section looks like we need to change the color so on the html where we have the text i'm going to add text white on the row then i'm going to save let's see so much better now next i'm going to add the background wave on this section so from the layout you can see we have a wave at the top of that section and another wave at the bottom of that section that means we have two waves so we're going to generate that from gatewaves dot io and here we're going to make sure that we generate something close or something similar like what we have on the left so here you're going to start with the top wave so i'm going to change the direction of the wave and then i'm going to play around with this icon till i find the one closed or similar to the one you're looking for so there it is i'm going to copy the code copy and then at the top of that section i'm going to paste then i'm going to change the hex value to white let's generate for the bottom section so here i'm going to change the direction and then i'm going to copy the code again and then at the bottom of that section paste then i'm going to change the again the x value to white so we have the three f's or six f's i'm going to save let's see and now you can see that is our section with the two waves next i'm going to create the carousel so on the html i'm going to create another row for that content so i'm going to start with the comments start the carousel content so here i'm going to start a new row with a class of align item center so to save time i'm going to copy an example code from the bootstrap documentation so you can go to getbootstrap.com so this one is the bootstrap component so you can check on the components and then carousel so here i'm going to scroll down till i find the one that you're going to use so i'm going to copy the code for this one with captions so i'm going to copy this code and then i'm going to paste so next thing i'm going to do is just remove the the two carousel items and then be left to only one so i'm going to remove the second one and the third one and then i'm going also to remove the captions and also the indicators so i'm going also to remove the indicators also i'm going to remove the image and this class for colossal caption so i'm going to remove also that one so now let's go ahead and add our own carousel content so if you check from the layout here we have this container with the white background and that is the container for the text the two icons for the quotes and the stars then we have this client picture and then the client name and the role so that's how we're going to nest it and here we're going to use the block element modifier to nest it that way so first i'm going to list them the three containers so we have testimonials underscore underscore card so this is the container which will have the text the stars and the two icons for the quotes then i'm going to commend them so that we know where they start so we have testimonial card and then you're going to start again a comment we have the client picture so again we need a container for that which is testimonials underscore underscore picture and then we need the client's name enroll so again testimonials underscore underscore name so inside the card you're going to start with the text so we have a paragraph with a class of line height latch then we need that icon that is the left quote so we have the icon and then the font or some solid class and then the name of that icon is quote left then some dummy text so we have lorem 21 and then we need the right quote so i'm just going to copy the first one and then this one is right then we need the stars so we have a class called ratings so we have the icon and then the font or some solid class and then the name of that icon is star so here i'm going to duplicate four more times two three four five then i'm going to add the picture and first i'm going to copy the pictures to my project i already have them so here i have a folder called testimonials you can see we have client one to client five they are in jpeg so i'm going to copy the entire folder to my project so inside the images i'm going to paste so now we can add the pictures so here i have an image with a class of image fluid for responsive image and then alt so i'm going to write client minus dollar sign or sign each value picture and then hit tab so we have the source which is images and then testimonials we have client1.jpg so i'm going to save then we need to add the client name so here i'm going to use h3 so let's see from the layout so i'm going to start with cleveland so that is the first client just copy actually we need to make sure that the client name matches the name so client one is a mail so that one should not be that so i'm going to change the name so let me see again so we have the name so i'm going to copy that paste then the client roll so here i'm going to use the paragraph with a class of lead so what is the role see you in founder ceo and founder so actually this color should be font with light so i'm going to save we can see how it looks like on the browser so this is how the content looks like so we're going to style it so let's make sure that we add to the rest of the client items that is the testimonial or carousel item so here i'm going to comment we have carousel item one then i'm going to duplicate carousel hm1 for the second client so duplicate for the second client and then i'm going to change the comment to carousel item 2 and then change the client name so we have client 2. also the alt so you're going also to change the name so you can see from the layouts we have joy marette finance manager and then the role of that client is finance manager i'm going to duplicate carousel at m2 for the that client so duplicate and then this one is carousel item three so we have client name three client three for the alt and then for the name so i'm going to paste that name and then the role is global finance sorry global brand manager so i'm going to duplicate corrosion item 3 for the fourth client duplicates and then this one is carousel 184 we have client for alt client four and then the name so best so that is co ceo end founder so i'm going to save let's say so we have the corrosion items so the buttons can't work until we change the active class so the only corrosion item we need to be active is the first one so you can see here we have a crossover active so we need to change the rest so remove the active class for the second third and the fourth one so save so now if you click the controls you'll see they are working so the next step now is to style this section so on testimonials.css you're going to style it the way we have nested on the html so we're going to start with the first one which is the card so we have the underscore underscore card and then we have underscore underscore picture and then we have underscore underscore name so for the card we are going to set the background color to white so actually i'm going to use rgb so we have the white color with an opacity of 0.8 then we need some padding so i'm going to set the padding to 2 ram that is for the top and bottom and then 1.25 for the left and right then we need the border radius so i'm going to set that to 0.625 ram and then some height you're going to set that to auto so we need to align text at the center so we have text align center so i'm going to save let's see how it looks like so far so that's how it's look like that is the container for the text and the two coats and the stars also inside the card we're going to style the two icons for the quotes and the star ratings so here we have the icon and here i'm going to start with the font size of that icon so here i'm going to use 1.5 ram and then the color so i'm going to use rgba we have primary with an opacity of 0.7 then we also need to style the star ratings or the rating stars so we have that class inside the card also and then the icon is inside the ratings so we have the icon and you're going to set the color and the font size so for the color going to copy what you've used here on the icons for the quotes and then set the font size we're going to use one ram so i'm going to save let's see from the browser so there you have it you can see now they have changed the color next let's style the picture and here on the picture i'm going to start by setting the wind and the height so you have wind i'm going to set that to 6 ram we can change that if it's too small or too large also the same with height 6 ram and then we need to set the position to absolute so i'm going to save let's see so now that is the size of the picture so we need to make it circle or rounded so on the html we're going to add that rounded circle class on the image or the picture so i'm going to select the four classes and then i'm going to add rounded circle i'm going to save let's see so now you can see our pictures around it the next thing now is to position these pictures at the center of this white container so back on the testimonials where we have that picture so here we're going to set left we're going to use 50 then we have transform translate we have minus 50 percent minus 50 and then i'm going to save let's see and as you can see that is the position that you want it so the next thing is to add the border the rounded border so here we have the image and then we have the border so wind i'm going to use 0.325 ram solid and then color we're going to use rgba we have primary with an opacity of 0.7 i'm going to save let's see and there you have it you can see now our picture has that border next you're going to style the name so we have the name here so i'm going to start with the padding top to give it some space so we have padding top i'm going to use forem we need some margin at the bottom so we have margin bottom i'm going to use one ram we need to align text at the center so we have text align center then we need some font to it so here i'm going to use 500 and then the color of the text white so then you can see we're going to nest it they have down on the html so we have h3 so here we can just set the padding top to 0.8 ram so i'm going to save let's see and there you have it i think forum is a bit it's too big so let me change that to three save so there is better so the next thing is to style the role so before we go to the role we need to add the text transform so we need to set that to capitalize and then we need now to style the role so we have a paragraph some padding at the bottom padding bottom you're going to set that to 2 ram then text transform you're going to set to capitalize so i'm going to save let's see and there you have it that is our role so the only thing i'm going to do is put some padding on the stars so on the html where we have the stars i'm going to select all the classes for ratings the four of them at once and then i'm going to add padding one save let's see so much better now next i'm going to customize the controls from the layout you can see we have the controls at the bottom so we're going to customize and replace the defaults which are on the sides you can see we have these two controls on the sides so let's work on that so at the bottom here you're going to remove the span for the two and then you're going to replace this class carousel control for the previous we're going to use the btn classes so here we have btn btn outline outline lights and then we need that icon that is the font awesome icon so we have the glass front or some solid and then the name of that icon is long arrow alt right so we have it here so this one is left and then i'm going to copy this class to the next button or to the next class paste and then you need to change that to right then i'm going to save let's see from the browser so now you can see we have the controls but we need them at the center so let also work on that so here i'm going to put them inside a container called the text center so i'm going to select all of them the two and then add text center class so we have text center and then paste them inside that container or that class and then i'm going to save let's see so now you can see we have the controls at the center and you can see once you click they are moving to the next glance or carousel item so the next step now is to make sure that our section is fully responsive so i'm going to right click and inspect elements so first again to see how it looks like on various devices you can see this one is moto g4 again screen width 360. and you can see the content is fitting nicely on that screen device so let's see from another device like pixel 2 again you can see our content is fitting nicely let's see from an ipad again you can see the content is fitting nicely so even without writing the media breakpoints you can see our section is fully responsive so i'm going to look from another device like iphone 678 plus and as you can see our section is fully responsive so with that we can move on to the next section welcome back in this video we are going to create section 6 of the layout which is the frequently asked questions so we are going to use bootstrap component called accordion so once you click on the question then the accordion collapses and reveals the item so let's get started and create something similar like what we have here on the layout so on the html we are going to start that section first is a comment we have start section 6 the frequently asked questions so i'm going to start the section with an id of frequently asked questions faq and a class of faq we need a container and also arrow tab so here you're going to start with the heading and then the heading line and then the subheading so here we have h1 with a class of display three and a class of fontweight bold so we have faq and here we also need to add another class which is text capitalize or text uppercase you can see up we have that class text uppercase and also on the row we need to add the text center class after the heading we have that heading line so we have that class heading line and then the sub heading which is a paragraph with a class of lead so i'm going to copy and then paste and then i'm going to save let's see from the browser and there you have it you have it you can see now we have that heading next i'm going to add the accordion content so on the html i'm going to create a new row for that content so we have the comment which is accordion content so i'm going to start a new row and some margin at the top so i'm going to choose margin top 5 and then here you need to specify the column size that you want to use so that one will reflect on the size of the accordion that you're going to have so for now we can use call md 12. so that one will go full length so to save time i'm going to copy the example code from the bootstrap documentation so you can go to get bootstrap.com and then under the components you'll find accordion so here there are two examples that you can copy we have the first one and then we have the second one called the accordion flash so this one removes the default background color some borders and some rounded corners to render accordions edge to edge with their parent container so i'm going to copy the example for the first one so i'm going to copy the entire code and then paste and there you have it so here because we have four accordion items you can see from the layout you can see we have four so we need to duplicate one which is the third so we have from here i'm going to duplicate for the fourth accordion item so once you duplicate you must change some things like the id attributes you can see here collapse 3 we need to change that to 4. also you need to change the area labeled by so you need to change that to 4. also this one is three is four then i'm going to save let's see from the browser and that is our content so once you click then the accordion collapses and reveals the item so we have according to accordion item two we have accordion item three and finally accordion item four so let's comment this accordion item so that you can know where they start let's start with the first one so we have accordion item one so i'm going to comment that accordion item one that is a comment so i'm going to copy that comment for the rest of the accordion items we have the second one we have the third one and finally we have the fourth so now we are ready to customize the accordion so here we're going to customize a few things if you check from the layout here we're going to add some space between the accordion items so that we can separate the accordion items and then you're going to add shadow and then you're going to add some padding between the questions and then also we need to change the question to reflect what we have here on the left so let's work on that so first i'm going to select all the accordion items so that we can add the two classes so we're going to add shadow and then you're going to separate or add some space between the accordion items by using margin bottom so we have margin bottom three so i'm going to save let's see and there you have it you can see now we have some space between the accordion items and then that shadow so the next one is to make sure that the questions reflect what we have here on the left so we have the first question so i'm going to copy so i have changed the question i'm going to save let's say from the browser so now you can see the questions reflect what you have there on the layout so the next one is to add some padding between the questions so here we have accordion padding x and accordion padding y so to do that you're going to override some of the bootstrap defaults so you're going to go to the variables file which can be found inside the node modules and that is the bootstrap variables file and then bootstrap scss and then down here you have that file variables.css so here on the variables where we have the accordion we're going to copy the two variables that is according padding y and you can see the default is one ram and according paddingx and the default is 1.2 ram so i'm going to copy the two variables and then inside the custom so where we have the according overheads i'm going to add that variables and then i'm going to remove the two defaults or the default flag so here you're going to override according padding y to 1.5 and also according padding x we're going also to override that to 1.5 so both are going to use 1.5 ram so i'm going to save let's see and there you have it you can see now we have that padding and that is what we have here on the layout so you can see the space is the same next is to make sure that our section is fully responsive so i'm going to right click and inspect element so this is how the section look like on a screen window of 360. that's moto g4 and you can see the content is fitting nicely so i'm going to change to another screen device like ipad ipad again you can see our content is fitting nicely on that screen device so let's change to another one like iphone 6 7 8 plus again you can see our content is fitting nicely so even without creating or writing any media breakpoint our section is fully responsive so we can move on to the next section welcome back in this video we are going to create section 7 of the layout which is the portfolio so here going to showcase some of the latest projects that our fake company has created so here we have some buttons and then once you hover the project you'll see they reveal the project name and the category of that project so let's get started and create something similar like what you

the row i'm going to add text center class save let's see so there you have it but now we need some space between the the previous section and the heading so on the row here i'm going to add some margin at the top so we have margin top five save let's see so now you can see we have some space between the previous section and that heading next i'm going to add the filter buttons so we have these buttons for filtering the categories so let's add the buttons so here i'm going to add another row for that content so we have filter buttons so a neuro with a class of text center and then a column so we're going to use call md12 so here we have button with a class of btn and then btn outline primary and the type of the button is button so we have type which is button so so we have all and then i'm going to duplicate for the categories so the second category is websites the next one is design and then we have mockup so i'm going to save let's see from the browser and now you can see we have the buttons so what you're going to do is add some margin at the top so that you can have some space between the heading the subheading and the buttons so here we have the row we are going to add margin top three and then save let's see so i think we need to increase the margin so here i'm going to use margin top five and then margin bottom four and then some gutter so we're going to use gutter three and then save so now you can see we have some enough space next i'm going to add the content for their portfolio items from the layout here we have the nine columns which make up the nine portfolio items first i'm going to copy the portfolio images or the pictures to my project so here i have a folder called portfolio it has all the pictures for the portfolio they are named portfolio one all the way to portfolio nine and they are in jpeg so i'm going to copy the entire folder to my project so inside the images paste so now we have the pictures in our project now we can go ahead and add the portfolio items all that content so here you're going to create a new row for that content so i'm going to start with a comment which is that the portfolio content or portfolio items so here i'm going to create a new row and here i'm going to use emit to help us generate the 9 portfolio items at once so after draw we need the columns and here i'm going to group them and i'm going to create two breakpoints for large devices i'm going to use call lg4 and then for medium devices i'm going to use call md6 then we need the container for all the portfolio items so i'm going to call it portfolio box and then we need shadow so i'm going to add that shadow class and then we need the picture or the image so here again i'm going to group the picture the picture so we have the image and then the source of the images so we have a folder called images and then portfolio where we have the pictures so here we need the name of the files so we have portfolio minus dollar sign dot jpg so the dollar sign will assign each value so that we can have portfolio one to portfolio nine and they are in jpeg formats then we need the alt so we have portfolio dollar sign image and then also we need the title so we have title so we have portfolio dollar sign picture then we need the class for responsive image so we're going to use image fluid that one is a bootstrap response a bootstrap class for responsive images so we have image fluid then from there we need the container for the caption so i'm going to call it portfolio info and then we need the caption so we're going to create another class so we have div and then caption then from there we need the the caption so we're going to use h4 so we have h4 and the text will be project name goes here and then dollar sign and also the category project you have the p and then the text will be category project so at the end here i'm going to say times nine and it's going to generate for us all the nine portfolio items with the content so here you can specify the number of columns or the portfolio items that you want it to generate so we have nine so i'm going to say times nine hit tab and here you can see now it has generated for us all the contents including the pictures and it has a send also the values so i'm going to save let's see from the browser and there you have it you can see now we have the nine portfolio items next i'm going to style the content and we have a sass file for that section which is portfolio.css so i'm going to open that file and here the first thing i'm going to do is to use the module so we have the use and then custom that is the first module you're going to use because of the variables so use it at the start and then also we're going to use the mixing so we have components and then mixing so again use it as star and then close so here i'm going to start by styling the class called portfolio so this is the class we have on the section if we check from the html we have that class here on the section so here i'm going to set the padding and i'm going to set 4m for the top and bottom and then 0 for the left and right then you're going also to style the text on the buttons so we need to set the text transform to capitalize so we have the button so text transform capitalize i'm going to save let's see so now we have the text set to capitalize and you can see now they are capitalized so the next thing is to style the portfolio box and that one is a standalone container so we have portfolio box so here i'm going to start with the position i'm going to set that to relative then we're going to set the width 200 percent so the width is going to scale to the wind of the columns so remember here on the html we have the two columns we have call lg4 and column d6 so those are two different breakpoints and then also the height we're going to set that to 18.5 ram we can change that later to bigger too small so that means all our portfolio items will have an equal height so i'm going to save let's see from the browser so now you can see we have equal height on all portfolio items so the next thing is to style the images or the pictures to scale to the height of the portfolio box so here we're going to style it inside the portfolio box we have the image and here i'm going to set the width and the height to 100 percent 100 and also height so the height of the image is going to scale to the height of the parent container which is the portfolio box and we have set that to 18.5 ram so we have 100 save let's see so now you can see the pictures are scaled to the height of the parent container so the next thing is to hide some of the caption you can see they're overflowing so here you're going to use a property called overflow and you're going to set that to hidden save let's see and there you have it you can see now they are hidden let's also add some margin at the bottom so that we can separate the portfolio items so here we're going to set the margin bottom to 1.2 ram save let's see and there you have it you can see now we have some margin at the bottom to separate the portfolio items next i'm going to style the captions and also add the border at the top so if you check here from the layout you can see we have a board at the top and the captioning is only visible once you hover the portfolio item so let's work on that so here we're going again to nest it the way we have done on the html so we have the portfolio info inside the portfolio box so we have that class so this is the class or the container which has that background color so we have here going to set that background color so we have rgba so we have our primary an opacity of 0.75 and then i'm going to set the width and the height 200 percent so we have width 100 percent and also height also here i'm going to set the position to absolute and then we have the caption inside the portfolio info so we have that class so here i'm going to set the text align to center so i'm going to save let's see so nothing to show so here we're going to set the top to zero so we need to set that top zero and then i'm going to save let's see so now you can see we have the caption and that's background so the next thing is to position the caption at the center of the portfolio item so on the caption you're going to include that mixer so we have include which is going to position it at the center and you have that mixing code absolute center going to save let's see so now you can see we have the caption at the center so let's change the color so we have white close save let's see and there you have it so let's change or set detect text transform to uppercase so that we can make sure that the caption are in uppercase like what you have here on the left so let's set that so inside the caption we have that h4 so text transform we're going to set that to uppercase and then i'm going to save let's see and there you have it next we need to hide the captions and only make them visible once you hover the portfolio item so here we have the container for the caption which is portfolio info so here we need to set the opacity to zero and also visibility to hidden so we have opacity 0 and then visibility i'm going to set that to hidden so i'm going to save let's see so now you can see the captions have been hidden so we need the caption to be visible once you hover the portfolio item so down here we're going to create that over so we have the hoover effect and then you're going to call this class portfolio and then you're going to set the opacity to 1 and visibility to visible so opacity 1 and visibility visible i'm going to save let's see so now if you hover the portfolio time you can see the captions are visible the next thing is to add the border top at the top we need the board at the top like what we have here on the left so you can see we have that board at the top so let's also set that so we need it at the portfolio box so border top i'm going to use 0.5 frame for the wind solid and then the color we're going to use purple light so we have that color on the customs as well purple light i'm going to save let's see so you can see now we have that border at the top so something else i'm going to do is to create a transition which you're going to apply on the hoover effect so you can see once you hover the portfolio item that hover is so dry so let's create a transition which you're going to apply so that we can have that smooth hoover effect on the portfolio items so here we're going to create a mixing which you're going to use where we need to use that transition so i'm going to open that mixing and then down here we're going to create that mixing so i'm going to start with a comment which is transition property so we have the mixing art mixing and the name of that mixing i'm going to call it transition property so we are going to use transition duration so we have that and here i'm going to set to 1000 milliseconds another property you need is the transition property so we have transition property so i'm going to set to all and then i'm going to save then you're going to include this mixing where we have that hoover effect or any other place that you want to use that transition so we have the portfolio and then here i'm going to include that mixing so we have include and then transition property so i'm going to save let's say from the browser so now you can see once i hover the portfolio item you can see we have that smooth over effect or that smooth transition so something else before we finish this part is to i'm going to set where we have the portfolio info so we have top zero and left zero so i'm going to set also that to zero and then where we have that caption the heading i'm going to set the display to block so i'm going to save so now if you hover the portfolio you can see we have that smooth effect so before i finish up on the portfolio i'm going to do a few changes on the height of the images because you're going to have some issues on the height of the images on smaller devices so i'm going to right click and then i'm going to click on inspect elements so especially on medium devices you can see this one is a medium device and you can see the height is not scaling nicely so i'm going to rotate this width or the screen and here you'll see just like i said you're going to have some issues with the height of the images they're not scaling nicely on different devices so to make that work we're going to use maximum width on the height where we have the portfolio box so instead of the height we're going to set that using the max height so i'm going to set that max height which is going to scale to 18.5 ram and then on the image i'm going to remove the height so i'm going just to comment it and then i'm going to save let's see whether it will fix that so save let's see so now just like i said you can see now the images are scaling nicely that is the height of the images so we don't have issues now with the height of the images on medium devices so i'm going to close the inspector and then i'm going to resize the browser window so you can see now we don't have the issues with the height of the images they are scaling nicely so something else is we need to add where we have the image that is on hover we need to scale the images a bit so where we have that hoover pseudo class we're going to add we're going to scale the images so we have transform and then scale and then i'm going to scale that to 1.5 so i'm going to save let's see so close that before we do we save and then save so now if you hover the images you can see they are scaling a bit so i'm going to enlarge the browser window welcome back in this video we're going to create section 8 of the layout which is the get started also known as cta or call to action section so here you're going to start with the heading and then you're going to create the two equal columns with the left column having the cta info and then the right or the second column having the form so let's get started and create something similar like what we have on the left so on the html i'm going to start that section so i'm going to start with the comment as always so we have start section 8 get started so we have that section with a with an id of contacts and a class of get started we need a container and arrow tab so here going to start with the heading so we have h1 with a class of display three and a class of it bold and a class of text capitalize so we have that text get started then on the row here we need to add the text center class so text center so after the heading we need the heading line so we have that class heading line and then the subheading so we have p with a class of line heights large and then some dummy text we have lorem 12 and then i'm going to save let's see from the browser so far so now we have that text next i'm going to style this section and here we're going to set some padding and some background color so you can see here from the layout we're going to use this a gray color so let's work on that so we have a file for that section which is get started so i'm going to open that file and here the first thing i'm going to do is to use the modules so we have the custom module and the mixing module so we have the use and then custom so again use it as star also we need the mixing so we have again use components mixing use as star so i'm going to style the class we have on the section which is the get started so we have this class so here i'm going to set some padding top and bottom i'm going to set that to 4m and then left and right 0 then the background color we're going to use one of the gray colors so here i'm going to use gray 200. then i'm going to save let's see from the browser so there you have it next i'm going to create the two columns from the left here we have the two columns we have the left column with this gradient background which will have the cta info and then we have the red column with this white background which will have the form so let's work on that so on the html i'm going to create a new row for that content first let's start with a comment which is start the cta info or the cta content so i'm going to start a new row which will have the two columns so we have a row with a class of text white and then we have the two columns so i'm going to group them i'm going to start with call 12 and another column which i'm going to use called lg 6. then here at the end i'm going to say times two hit tab so on the first column we're going to have that gradient background and then on the second column we're going to have that white background so on the first column i'm going to add a class called gradient which you're going to create in a moment so gradient and then also shadow and some padding so i'm going to use p padding 3. and then on the second column we are going to have white background so we have bg white and then some shadow and also padding three then i'm going to create that gradient and we already have that mixing so i'm going to go to that file mixing.css so you're going to copy this gradient and then create it as a class so i'm going to copy and then on typography you're going to create it on that file so here we have our comment which is gradient bg and then we have that class gradient and then paste so i'm going to save let's see how it looks like on the browser so now you can see the two columns we have the left which has this gradient and then the right which has this white background next now we are going to add the content so inside the html on the first column we are going to create a class called cta info so this one will be the container for all the content that you're going to put on the first column so we have cta info and then we're going to set the width 200 percent so we have w100 so here we're going to start with the content for left column so we have this hundred percent satisfaction guarantee so i'm going to copy that text and then i'm going to start h4 with a class of display four and a class of fontweight bold and then paste that text the next text you're going to add is the paragraph so we have this dummy text so we have paragraph with a class of line height large and then some dummy text so we have lorem 21 and then after the paragraph we have this sub heading and then the list so here i'm going to have h3 with a class of display 3 and i'm going to modify that with brief so we're going to style it later and then the text and then from there we need the list so we have ul that is another list with a class of cta info underscore underscore list and then we have the list items so we have the li and then some dummy text lorem ipsum and then here i'm going to say times gray hit tab and now we have the text so i'm going to save let's see how it looks on the browser so now we have the content so here we need to make sure that they reflect what we have here on the layout so i'm going to copy the contents so we have the first list item paste so i've copied all the text or the list items so i'm going to save and check on the browser so now we have that text the next the next step is to style this content so on the sas file that is the get started.css we are going to create that container that is the cta info cta info so remember this is the container for all the content on the left column so we have that city info so here i'm going to set the padding to three ram all sides and then i'm also going to set the margin one ram top and bottom and then zero left and right from there going to style the list so we have underscore underscore list so here i'm going to start by setting the position to relative then i'm going to set the list style type to none and then display we're going to set that to block so i'm going to save let's say from the browser so that is how the content looks like now next i'm going to style the list items from the layout here you can see the list item are using this check icon and here we're going to use the unicode for this check icon so on the sas file you're going to nest it the way you have done on the html so we have the list item inside the class list so we have the li and then content before because the check icon must come before the list items so here you're going to start with the font family and you're going to use the font awesome file free so we have the double quotes and then fonts awesome five free then the contents and just like i said you're going to get the unicode from font or some documentation so we have that cheat sheet that is the front of some cheat sheet so here you're going to search for that icon so i'm just going to type check and then it's going to list for us all the versions of the check icon and you can see here we have that icon and then the unicode so the unicode of that icon is f00c so i'm going to copy that then on the content we're going to add the double quotes and then the backslash and then the unicode like that then we need to set the font to it and here you must set any value from 600 and above so i'm going to use 600 then i'm going to save let's see from the browser how it looks like and there you have it now you can see we have the check icon on the list items the next step now is to add some padding and some space between the icon and the list items so here i'm going to set margin right so i'm going to use 0.5 ram and then also set the font size so i'm going to use 1.2 ram and then on the list that is the list class i'm going to set paddingtop i'm going to use 0.5 ram and then padding left i'm going to use 0.5 also and then some margin at the bottom i'm going to use 0.7 ram so i'm going to save let's see and there you have it now you can see we have some enough space between the content next i'm going to add the content for the second column so from the layout here we have this heading that says start your project and then the form so let's work on that so here just like we did with the first column i'm going to create a container for that content so i'm going to call this container form and then we're going to set the width 200 percent so we have w 100 and then some padding at the bottom so we have padding bottom two so we're going to start with that heading and here we're going to use the same heading that we used on the services so just to show you where we have that heading on the services you can see we have this heading with the background clip so these are two colors so we're going to use the same heading on that part so i'm going to have h4 with a class of display three and you're going to modify that with title and then some margin at the bottom so you have margin bottom five so you have that text which is start your project so i'm going to save let's see from the browser so now you can see we have that heading next let's start the form so before i add the form i must mention that in the new version that is booster version 5 they dropped the use of the form group class so here we're going to use one of the utility classes to wrap up our form or the input fields so we have the form and then the action we're going to have that for now and then we have the class row so we have so here we're going to use margin bottom three so you must have that class so mp3 and then the inputs this one is for the first name and we have the type of the input which is text and then we need the placeholder so the placeholder is first name and then you also need the id input first name and then we need the class form control so i'm going to hit tab so here i'm going to duplicate for the last name and then i'm going to change the placeholder to last name and also the inputs and then i'm going also to duplicate again for the email so this one the input type is an email placeholder email address so we have the id input email and then i'm going to duplicate for the message so the type is actually it is not an input it's a text area so i'm going to remove that and then add text area so the name message id message and then you're going to add the class so i'm going to copy this form control and then add it on the text area and here we just only need rows eight so i'm going to set from ten to eight so i'm going to save let's see from the browser how it looks like so this is our form so we need to add some shadow and then make sure that our input feeder large like what we have here on the layout so i'm going to select the class for the four of them and then i'm going to add shadow and then we need also to add another class so i'm going to select and add form control large so this one is from control so i'm going to save let's see so now you can see our form so we need to add the placeholder where we have the message so i'm going to copy save let's see and there you have it the next one let's add the button text center so we have that class and then also going to set the display to grid so we have d grid and then some margin at the top so we have margin top one and then now we need that button so we have button and the type of the button is button and then the class we have btn btn primary and then rounded rounded pill and then we have padding top three and also padding top sorry padding bottom three so we have pb three so so that you can have some space between the content so i'm going to hit sub and then here we're going to add submit so let's see save and there you have it now you can see we have that button next you're going to add the you can see we have an icon so we're going to add that icon so that one should come after the text so we have the icon and then the class font or some solid and then the name of that icon is paper plane save let's say and there you have it next i'm going to style this content so on the get started so here i'm going to start with the comments so we have the form content so we have that class form and here i'm going to set the padding so we have i'm going to set padding to three ram so remember here on the cta info we set that to 3 ram also so i'm going to set that to 3 ram and then you're going to style the button so you have the button inside the form so here i'm going to set the border to none and then we have the color i'm going to use white and then we're going to style any link we're going to start with the color which i'm going to set that to white and then text decoration we're going to set that to none also and then text transform i'm going to set that to capitalize so i'm going to save let's see and there you have it you can see now we have our content next let's make sure that our form looks similar like what we have on the left and that is to have the first name and the last name in one row so here i'm going to create two equal columns which is going to split the two and also make our form fully responsive so let's work on that so remember here we have a class called row that means any column that you put inside the row will be displayed using flex so for the first name and the last name i'm going to select the two classes and then here i'm going to add a column which is going to split the two on large devices only and then on any other device then they're going to go to full width so i'm going to use call lg6 and then for the email address and the message i'm going to use call lg 12. that means they'll go full width regardless of the screen width so we have call lg12 save so let's see so here you can see already we have the first name and the last name being split into two and this one will only happen on large devices only so i'm going to right click and inspect elements so you can see this one is a device with a screen window of 360 and you can see already the first name and the last name are going full width so it's only on large devices where you're going to have the first name and the last name split into two so i'm going to change to another device and this one will be a medium device like an ipad and this is a screen window of 768 and you can see the input field are going full length we can even do the same way we have done on large devices where we have the first name and the last name split into two so here going to add a column which is going to create that media breakpoint for medium devices so here i'm going to add call md6 and then i'm going to save let's see and there you have it you can see now on medium devices we have two columns or two columns for the first name and the last name and they are in the same row so with that i think our form is fully responsive across variety of screen devices welcome back in this video we're going to create section 9 of the layout which is the footer and on the footer we have four parts of the footer we have the top footer which has the contact info we have the mobile email and the location and then we have the social media part and then we have the company info and then at the bottom we have the copyright information so let's get started and create something similar like what we have on the layouts so on the html i'm going to start that section and i'm going to start with a comment as always so we have start section 9 the footer so here i'm going to to start that section so we have footer with a class of footer and a container and then i'm going to hit tab and then you're going to style that class so i'm going to save and then on the sas file for that section which is the footer.sss i'm going to open that file and then the first thing i'm going to do is to use the modules so we have the first one which is the custom so custom and then use it as star then we also have the mixing so we have the use components and then mixing use it as star so here i'm going to style the footer we have that class already and here i'm going to set paddingtop i'm going to set that to one ram then the background color so here we're going to create this color we don't have it on the custom source file so here i'm going to create a variable called footer specifically for that section so i'm going to save and then we need to create this variable on the custom sauce file so i'm going to open that file so this is a new color so i'm going to add it where we have the white and the gray colors let me just add on my theme colors so we have variable footer and then i'm going to assign it this color that is one f151 close and then i'm going to save let's see from the browser and there you have it at the bottom here you can see we have that color so we're going to start with the top footer which has this contact info we have the icon the phone the working hours and then we have the email icon the email and then we have the location and the icon so you're going to start with that footer so in the html i'm going to use emmett to generate the three sections at once so here i'm going to start a new row and then i'm going to add the columns so i'm going to group them and here i'm going to use columns that are going to create different breakpoints for medium devices i'm going to use call md4 for large devices i'm going to use call lg4 and then we need the container for all that content so i'm going to call it contact box then we need some padding at the top so i'm going to add that class padding top one and then we need the container for the icon you can see here from the layout you have the icon the title and the subtitle same way with email and the location so here we're going to use block element modifier to nest it so again we have that class contact box and then underscore underscore icon so that one will be the container for the icon and then we need the container for the title and the subtitle so here i'm going to add a plus and then again contact box and that's called underscore info so the info will have the title and the subtitle then i'm going to add the title so we have the link with the class of contact box underscore underscore info and then i'm going to modify that with title so we have minus minus title and then we have the text so i'm going to have title goes here so we're going to replace that with the actual content for that title and then we need the subheading so here we're going to use paragraph with the class of contact box and that's called underscore info minus minus subtitle so the text we're going to use subtitle goes here again you're going to replace that with the actual contents so here at the end i'm going to say times three and then it's going to generate for us or the three section or the three columns at once with the content so hit tab and now you can see we have the first container that is for the phone or the mobile number and then we have the second one for the email and then the third one for the location so i'm going to comment them so that we can know where they start so we have the first column so it's i'm going to say stats or just content for the phone or for the mobile number and then we have contact for email content for email and then you have the that one which is content for location so i'm going to save let's see how it looks like on the browser so that is our content looks like so far so we're going to style it you can see we have the title goes here for the first one the second one and the third one next i'm going to add the icons from the layout here you can see we have the phone icon for the phone content we have the mail icon for the email content and then we have the location icon for the location content and these are svg icons and i must mention that there are different sources that you can get these svg icons but if you want to use the same icons that have used here then you need to go to tableau icons.com so you're going to start with the first icon which is the phone icon so we're just going to type phone and by doing that you'll be able to see that icon and you can see it here the name of that icon is phone call so i'm going to click it to copy the svg code so click and you can see now it says copied and then on the first column where we have the container for the icon i'm going to paste that code there so paste next we need the icon for the email so again you're going to type or search for that icon so i'm just going to type email and here you can see we have that icon you can see it here mail opened that is the name of that icon so i'm going to click it to copy the code so again where we have the icon that is the content for email we have that container paste the next one is the location icon so i'm going to search for that so again on the table icons i'm going to search for location and by doing that you'll be able to see the icon and you can see it here the name of that icon is map2 that is map 2 copy and then on the icon container i'm going to paste so i'm going to save let's see from the browser how it looks like and there you have it you can see now we have the three icons so let's also replace the titles the subtitle with the actual content that we have on the left so let's start with the phone number so i'm going to copy so i'm going to and then we have the subtitle which is the working hours so let's do the same for the email and the location so copy so i've copied that let's also do the same for the location so i've replaced all the content so i'm going to save let's see and there you have it now you can see we have the actual content so the next step nice to style the content so we already have a sass file for that section which is footer.sss so here you're going to style the contact box which is the container for that content so let's start with the comment which is style the contact box content so we have that class contact box so here i'm going to set the position to relative then you're going to style it the way we have nested on the html so from the html you can see we have this class which is contact box underscore underscore icon and then we have contact box underscore underscore info which has the title and the subtitle so that's how we're going to style it so let's start with the icon we have underscore underscore icon and then another one is info so you have underscore underscore info which you're going to modify the title and the subtitle so for the title we're going to modify that so we have minus minus title and then also for the subtitle minus minus subtitle so here i'm going to start with the width and i'm going to set the width and the stroke that means on the html where we have the three icons we need to remove a few things and one of them is the wind and the height you can see it's already set to 444 and also remove the stroke and that is the color of that stroke so let's start with the wind and the height so i'm going to select and then target the three icons so you have the second and then that one backspace and then also the stroke color so we have the stroke color so i'm going to remove it and then for the stroke wind you're going to set that to one so i'm going to remove the five and then save then you can go ahead and set the width of the icon so here i'm going to set the width so i'm going to use 4m and then the stroke i'm going to use primary so i'm going to save let's see from the browser and there you have it you can see now we have the three icons and the color of the icon has changed to purple so next let's style the title and the subtitle so for the info we're going to set the padding so i'm going to set the parting to 0.4 ram and then for the title let's start with the color that is white and then text decoration none and then for the subtitle let's set the color so we're going to use one of the gray colors you can see from the layouts we have this gray color so we're going to use one of the gray colors so here we have gray 300 so that is the color we're going to use and then we need also to set text decoration to none and also not forgetting the font size of the title and the subtitle so for the title we're going to set the font size to one ram or 1.4 and then font size for the subtitle you're going to set that to one ram so i'm going to save let's see so that is how the content looks like i think gray 300 is not the correct color so let's try gray 600 save let's see and there you have it so something else is we need to set the font weight of the title and the subtitle you can see they are a bit bold so i'm going to set here for the info so you have font to it i'm going to use 600 save let's see so much better now next i'm going to set the display for this content and this will create different breakpoints so that we can target different screen devices and this will also make our content fully responsive so on the html where we have the three columns i'm going to select the three and then here we're going to add the display utility classes which are going to create different breakpoints so for medium devices i'm going to set the display to block so we have d and then medium and then block for large devices we're going to set the display to flex so we have display large flex and then for small devices you're going to set the display to flex or any other device so you have display flex so i'm going to save let's say from the browser so you can see now the display has changed you can see now on large devices it is using the display flex so i'm going to right click so that we can check for other devices and inspect elements so you can see here these are this one is a medium device it's an ipad with a screen window of 768 you can see the display has set to block so you can see the icon is on top of the title and says the subtitle that means that display is working on that device so let's see from a small device so i'm going to switch device let's go for moto g4 so again here you can see the display is set to flex so i'm going to switch to another device another small device like galaxy s5 again you can see the display is set to flex so the only thing you're going to do here is to reduce the for the width of the icons on small devices and medium devices so here i'm going to add a media breakpoint which is going to target large devices only so on the footer where we have that icon i'm going to add the midi breakpoint so we have include media breakpoints up and here you're going to to target from small device and then you're going to set the width to 4m so copy paste then on small device you're going to set that to 2 ram so i'm going to save let's see and now you can see the icons have reduced the size so the next thing is to also reduce the title and the subject on small devices so again here we're going to create create or include a midi breakpoint which is which is going to target large devices so i'm going to copy that media breakpoint and then add it where we have the title so here you're going to set the font size to 1.4 m and then one ram for small devices so this one will also apply to subtitles so i'm also going to copy where we have the subtitle so we need to include that media breakpoint and then where we have large devices are going to have one ram and then we are going to reduce the font size on small devices to weight 0.8 and then i'm going to save or 0.9 let's see and there you have it you can see now we have the title and the subtitle they're a bit small so let's switch to another device let's go for a medium device we have an ipad so again you can see the content is fully responsive let's go for a large device ipad pro again you can see the content is fully responsive so here i'm going to switch back to a small device and here the only thing i'm going to do is to make sure that the icon and the title are lining together so i'm going to add some padding where we have the icon so we have padding top so i'm going to set the padding top to 0.5 ram so save let's see and there you have it i think we need also to reduce the font size of the subtitle so i think 0.9 is a bit large so here i'm going to set to 0.8 and then save let's see so now i think everything is perfectly fine so on all devices our content now is fully responsive so we can move on to the next step next i'm going to create the content for the second part of the footer which is the social media so on the html i'm going to create a container for that content so here i'm going to start with a comment which is start the social media content so here i'm going to create a class called footer social media so you have footer dash social media so i'm going to use the two initials and then here going to style the background you can see here we have this light background so i'm going to add an inline style so we have style we have background color and then i'm going to use 21 21 21 so that is the hex value for that color then from there we need a container a row and the two columns you can see here we have the two columns we have the first column with this content that says connect with us on social media and then we have another column for the social icons or for the social media icons so we have a container and a row and then i'm going to add some padding so we have padding y i'm going to set that to 4 and then text center so we need to add that class and then tab so here i'm going to create two and equal columns which are going to create different breakpoints so from the left you can see we have the first column which has this text that says connect with us on social media and then we have the second column which has these social media icons so here for large devices i'm going to use call lg5 that is for the first column and then for medium devices i'm going to use call md6 and then some margin at the bottom so you need to add that class margin bottom 4 tab and then paste that text then for the second column on large devices i'm going to use call lg 7 so that they make it 12 so we have caller g7 and then color g5 for the first column and for medium devices i'm going to use call md6 and then tab so here we're going to start with the facebook icon and then twitter github linkedin and then instagram so we're going to create them in that order so here we have the link and then the icon and then here we're going to use the font awesome brand class and then the name of that icon is facebook and then tab so i'm going to duplicate for the rest of the icons so for the second icon we have twitter that icon we have linkedin sorry we have github and then for the fourth one we have linkedin so we have linkedin and then the fifth one we have instagram so you have instagram and then i'm going to save let's see from the browser and there you have it you can see now we have that text oh sorry those icons but we don't see the text so here we need to add the class text white so here we have the row i'm going to add text white and then save let's see and there you have it so the next step now is to style that content so the footer.css we're going to style that class so at the bottom here i'm going to start with a comment which is style the social media content and then we have that class foota social media so here i'm going to style the links which includes the social media icons so i'm going to set the color to white so we have white then we have the icon inside the link so i'm going to set the font size to one ram which is the default and then some margin at the left to separate the icons we have margin left i'm going to use one ram so i'm going to save let's say from the browser and there you have it so the next step now is to make sure that we create a media or include a media breakpoint which is going to target large devices that is the font size of the icon so first i'm going to open the inspector right click and then inspect element so that you can see how it looks like on other devices so inspect element so here i'm going to include that media breakpoint and i'm going to copy what we have here copy and then here for large devices we're going to use 1.7 or 1.6 and then i'm going to save so let's see from the browser so you can see now our content is fitting nicely on a small device screenwind 360. so i'm going to switch to another device like a medium device we have ipad again you can see our content is fitting nicely including the size of the fonts of the social media icons so something else is we need to fix that is the space between at the bottom where we have the social media content so i'm going to close the inspector so you can see here at the bottom we have so a big space so we need to fix that so in html where we have the first column we're going to add a class which is mb md0 so we have that class which is going to fix that so save let's see so now you can see we don't have that space so uh content is fully responsive and now we can move to the next part which is part so on the third part of the footer we have the four columns we have the first column with the company info and then we have the rest of the three with the links so let's work on that so on html i'm going to create a container for that content so we have a comment first which is start the content for company info that is for the company info so that is a comment so here i'm going to start that container which will have a row so we have the row with a class of text white and justify content center so we have that class so justify content center and then some margin at the top so here i'm going to use margin top three and then some padding at the bottom so we have padding bottom three and then tab so inside the row we need the four columns so we're going to start with the first one which is a bit large or a bit big than the rest of the three so that one you're going to to create it separately so we have so we're going to start with the call 12 and then for small devices we're going to use call small 6. for large devices you're going to use call lg 6 so you have six and then tab so inside the first column you're going to add the heading which is company name and then they info about that company and then this line so we have h5 with a class of text capitalized and a class of fun to it bold so we have company name then we need that line so that one is a hra hr with a class of bg white and a class of display inline block and then submarine at the bottom so we have margin bottom we're going to use four and then tab and then we need to style it so we have style so we have width i'm going to use 60px and then height so height i'm going to set that to 2px 2 pixels so i'm going to save let's see from the browser how it looks like and there you have it you can see now we have that text so let's also add the text so we have it below the hr so we have paragraph with a class of finite large and then some dummy text so i'm going to use lorem 17 and then save let's see and there you have it so now we have that text i'm going to add the three remaining columns so here i'm going to use call 12 and then for small devices i'm going to use call small 6 and then for large devices i'm going to use call large 2 that is called lg2 and then some margin at the bottom so we have mb4 so at the end here i'm going to say times three because we need three of them so hit tab so for the first column you're going to copy what we have here that is the heading the line the two so i'm going to paste for the three columns paste paste so for the second column we have heading as so let's see from the layout we have products useful links and then contacts so that is the order so we have the second heading so we have products and then useful links and then the that one which is contacts save let's see how it looks like and there you have it you can see now we have the three headings so the next one now is to add the list you can see we have the listing form of the the listing form of the links so let's add also those links so i'm going to start with the links for the products so we have another list with a class of list inline and then we need the list items so we have the li which will have a link inside and then some dummy text so i'm going to use lorem ipsum and then i'm going to hit tab so i'm going to duplicate for the three links so i'm going to duplicate three times so we have one two three so i'm going to save let's see from the browser how it looks like and there you have it you can see now we have the list or the links so let's also copy for the useful links and the contacts so i'm just going to copy the entire anode list to the rest of the columns so for the useful links paste and also for the contacts paste so for these full links you can see we have a different content from the layout here you can see the content is different so i'm going to copy this and then replace with what you have so copy and then i'm going to pause the video and then add them on to useful links so i've copied everything i'm going to save let's see from the browser and there you have it so the next step now is to style that content so here i'm going to start by styling the list items and i'm going to change the color to white and then remove the underline and also have some space to create some space between the list items so let's work on that so on the footer.success at the bottom here i'm going to start with the comment which is style the company info content so that is a comment and here i'm going to create a class which is going to style that list items so i'm going to call it company list so we have company list so i'm going to set the display to block so that is the first thing i'm going to do so you have block and then you're going to set the list style type to none so we have list type so i'm going to set that to none and also we need to set the position to relative then we need to style the list items so we have the ally inside the list style so i'm going to set the margin bottom so i'm going to use 0.5 ram and then text decoration i'm going to set to it to none to remove that underline and then we need also to style the links that are inside the list items so we have the color i'm going to change that to white or set it to white and then also text decoration we need to set that to none so the next thing now is to add this class to the list items that we have on the html so i'm going to select the ul class that is an ordered list for the three so we have the first one second one and the third one and then add that class company list and then i'm going to save let's see save and there you have it you can see now we have the list items so the next thing is to make sure that once you hover the list or the links they turn to our primary color so like what we have here on the layout so you can see from the left once you over the links return to that primary so on the list again we have the company list so we have the hoover and then i'm going to set the color to primary so we have primary and then i'm going to save let's see so now if you try to hover the links you'll see return to that primary so the next thing also is to add some space between the social media content and the company info so you can see we need some enough space or good space like what we have here on the left so here on the html i'm going to add some margin top where we have that container so i'm going to add that class margin top five so that one will fix that and then save and there you have it the next step now is to make sure that our content is fully responsive so i'm going to open the inspector so inspect element so that is how the content looks like on a medium device and that's an ipad screen wind 768 and you can see already the media breakpoint is already working so i'm going to switch to another device this one will be a small device so let's go to moto g4 so again here you can see the content is fitting nicely on that screen device so let's switch to another one so let's go for a larger device ipad pro so again here you can see the content is also fitting nicely and it's fully responsive so even without writing a single media breakpoint you can see our columns are already creating the media breakpoints we have created so the only thing i'm going to do is to add the mx auto that is the class for horizontal centering on the columns that we have so i'm going to select all the columns and then add that class so we have the second one the third one and then the fourth one so we have that class mx auto so i'm going to save let's see so with that our content now is fully responsive and you can move on to the next part which is part 4 of the footer that is the bottom footer so on the bottom footer we have the copyright info and this is our fourth part of the footer so let's work on that so on the html i'm going to create a container for that content so let me start with the comment which is start the copyright info so here i'm going to create a class called footer bottom so inside that we need a cloud container so i'm going to create that container and arrow with a class of text center and a glass of text white and then tab so inside that row we need a class or a column so i'm going to use call 12 then inside the column i'm going to create another class or another container for the copyright content so we have footer bottom and then underscore underscore copyrights so from the left here we have the copyright symbol and then the text so i'm going to copy the entire text and then you're going to start with that symbol so we have the code copy we have it here and then the text so we have copyright 2021 and then here we need a link so i'm going to create that link and then paste and then here also we need a link and then paste so i'm going to save let's see how it looks like on the browser so now you can see we have the text at the bottom and that is the copyright info so the next thing nice to style that content so on the footer.success i'm going to start by setting the background color for the footer bottom so let's go to that file and then at the bottom here i'm going to start with a comment which is style the copyrights footer or basically content so we have that class footer bottom so here we have the background color and i'm going to use black so we have that color on the sass file and then here i'm going to nest it the way i've done on the html so we have underscore underscore copyright so i'm going to set the color to gray 600 so we have that color gray 600 and then phone to it i'm going to set that to 400. then we need to style the links again inside the copyright so we have a link and i am going to set the color to gray 300. so we have gray 300. and then text decoration we're going to set that to none so i'm going to save let's see from the browser so now that is our copyright so we need to add some padding so on the html where we have that class i'm going to add padding top and padding bottom so we have padding top i'm going to set that to five and then padding bottom also five and then i'm going to save let's see again and there you have it now you can see it's much better so the next thing is to create the hoover so we need the links to turn to our primary color so on the footer inside the link you're going to create that hoover effect so we have hover so the color we're going to set that to primary and then text decoration we're going to set that to underline underline so i'm going to save let's see so now if you try to hover the links you'll see we have that hoover which is our primary color so we need also to make sure that our footer bottom or copyright info is fully responsive so i'm going to right click and inspect elements to see from other devices so that is how the content looks like on a small device which is with a screen window of 360. so i'm going to switch to another device another smaller device pixel 2. again you can see your content is fitting nicely on that device let's go for a medium device again our content is fitting nicely on that screen device so with that we can move on by creating the next item which is the back to top button so you can see it here we have this back to top so on html i'm going to create that button at the end of the footer so here we have a comment first which is back to top button so we're going to create a link so we have the link with a class of shadow and a class of btn primary to give it that purple color and then we need to give it that rounded circle so get what that class which is rounded circle so we have tab and then inside the link we need that icon so you can see here from the left so we have this chevron app icon and that is the font awesome icon so here we have the icon with the class of font or some solid and the name of that icon is chevron app so i'm going to save let's see how it looks like so on the left here at the bottom left you can see we have the icon already so the next thing now is to style it and make sure that you position it at the right bottom so inside the footer so the bottom here i'm going to start with the comment which is style the back top button so here i'm going to create a class which is going to position and style that button so i'm going to call it back to top so i'm going to set the position to fixed that is the first property that i'm going to have so we have fixed and then set the width and the height of that button so we have width i'm going to use the ram and also the height also 3 ram then i'm going to set the position from right so we have right 1.875 ram and also the position from bottom also i'm going to use 1.875 ram also we need to set the z index so here i'm going to set a higher number so we have 99999 and then i'm going to save and then we need to add this class where we have that button so after the rounded circle paste back to top class and then i'm going to save let's see from the browser and there you have it you can see now we have that rounded button so the next thing is to position this icon at the center of that circle or the rounded circle so here going to nest it we have icon and then we have the color and the font size so i'm going to set first the color so we have color so white and then the font size so the front of the font is i'm going to use one ram and then we need to position at the center so we're going to include that mixing so we have include and the name of that mixing is absolute center and then close i'm going to save let's see and there you have it now you can see you have the icon at the center of that rounded circle or the button so now if you click the button you'll be able to scroll to the top and you can see the button is already working so click again and there you have it so with that we are done with that part and we've come to the end of this project if you made it to this far congratulations hope you've learned a lot from this project and if you have questions please post them on the comments thanks for
