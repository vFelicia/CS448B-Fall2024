00:25 - foundation version 6 made by zurb let's
00:29 - get straight into the crash course i'm

00:36 - dot
00:37 - zerb.com it should bring you to this
00:40 - website if it doesn't look like this

00:47 - we're gonna download the complete
00:49 - because it just gives us everything
00:52 - click download it should give you a zip
00:54 - file down here now you're gonna go to
00:56 - your desktop and you're going to click
00:58 - you're going to right click
00:59 - go to new
01:00 - folder
01:02 - you're going to name i'm going to name
01:03 - this foundation you can name it whatever
01:05 - you want
01:06 - back to your browser
01:10 - and go to
01:12 - your um your foundation download file
01:15 - click extract all
01:17 - click browse
01:18 - go to desktop click foundation
01:21 - click select folder
01:23 - and then click extract
01:25 - and what that does is basically
01:27 - takes all the files that we just
01:28 - downloaded and put it into our desktop
01:30 - file called foundation and we come down
01:33 - here and we read
01:34 - a little bit about it
01:36 - and how it works and it down here and it
01:38 - shows sites and emails you can also do
01:40 - foundation for emails but for this
01:42 - tutorial we're just going to do sites so
01:44 - we're going to want to do is you're
01:46 - going to go over to getting started then
01:48 - you're going to click
01:49 - sites
01:50 - kitchen sync
01:51 - and you should be in this giant long
01:53 - list called kitchen sink now kitchen
01:56 - sink is every element available in
01:58 - foundation all on one page as you see if
02:01 - you scroll down there's tons of tons of
02:03 - stuff you can put on to it we're going
02:05 - to go through all of it what you're
02:07 - going to want to do now is you're going
02:08 - to want to go down to your editor i'm
02:09 - using adam in this example
02:14 - and you're going to want to click open a
02:16 - project
02:19 - and we're going to select on foundation
02:23 - it should bring us
02:27 - okay so what we get is this
02:29 - large html file
02:32 - pretty long
02:34 - so what we're gonna want to do is we're
02:35 - going to want to
02:37 - delete everything
02:38 - out of the body tags
02:40 - keep the body tags
02:42 - delete everything inside of the body
02:43 - tags
02:44 - except for the javascript
02:50 - and you should be left with
02:55 - this
02:56 - okay so what we want to going to do next
02:59 - is we're going to build some simple form
03:00 - validation
03:02 - inside of foundation
03:04 - now we're gonna just start off with some
03:06 - form tags so we're gonna
03:08 - select that
03:10 - we're gonna write perform just like that
03:14 - we're gonna put some javascript data
03:16 - values in here so we're gonna put data
03:18 - dash
03:19 - abide
03:20 - and no validate
03:23 - we're gonna put a div inside of here
03:24 - we're gonna give it a class called grid
03:28 - x and grid
03:30 - dash margin
03:32 - dash x
03:34 - now inside of that dip we're gonna put
03:36 - another div and we're just gonna give it
03:38 - a class of cell we're gonna make another
03:39 - div we're gonna give it a class called
03:41 - alert
03:43 - blur
03:45 - all out
03:47 - we're gonna give it a style
03:49 - display
03:51 - none
03:53 - we're gonna go back and we're gonna add
03:54 - some javascript values data dash abide
03:59 - dash
04:00 - alert
04:02 - okay so next you're going to make
04:03 - another div
04:05 - and you're going to call it you're going
04:07 - to get a class of grid
04:11 - x
04:12 - and grid
04:14 - margin
04:16 - x and it's the same thing as this one up
04:18 - here it's just how foundation sorts out
04:20 - its uh their divs you're gonna put
04:23 - another div in here
04:24 - you're gonna give it a class called cell
04:27 - small
04:28 - dash 12. what you're going to do next is
04:30 - inside of this div you're going to put a
04:32 - label
04:37 - and you're going to put number
04:41 - number
04:43 - required
04:44 - now you're going to write an input tag
04:48 - and set the type to text or keep it as
04:51 - text and then put a placeholder of one
04:54 - two three four since we are validating
04:56 - numbers and we want the user to know
04:58 - what kind of input to put
05:00 - and then you're gonna put something
05:01 - called area dash describe
05:06 - describe
05:09 - i'm gonna set it equal
05:11 - and inside these are you're gonna put
05:13 - example
05:15 - help
05:17 - text
05:19 - make sure you capitalize the last two in
05:21 - camel case
05:22 - next you're going to put a required
05:24 - pattern so you're going to type in
05:25 - required
05:27 - and then you're going to put a space and
05:28 - then pattern
05:30 - and you're going to set it equal to
05:31 - number
05:33 - and then you can just take out this name
05:35 - and value
05:36 - it's not needed inside of there
05:38 - now next you're going to make a span
05:42 - and you're going to give it a class
05:45 - of form
05:46 - dash air
05:52 - and inside of this you can basically put
05:53 - whatever you want for when the user
05:56 - misspells something or something so you
05:57 - can say
05:58 - yo you've
06:00 - forgot something
06:04 - um
06:13 - like that so when there's an error
06:15 - message it'll just give you this
06:17 - this is basically the error message and
06:20 - after the span make sure you close out
06:22 - the label
06:33 - and after that label you can put
06:35 - paragraph tag
06:37 - and uh give it a class of help text so
06:40 - we're gonna put class
06:41 - help dash
06:43 - text
06:44 - save it and then you're gonna give it an
06:46 - id
06:50 - of example
06:52 - help
06:54 - text to make sure you camel case those
06:56 - and then next you're going to put
06:58 - whatever you want
06:59 - however you want to help the user so i'm
07:01 - gonna put
07:02 - here is
07:03 - how
07:04 - you fill
07:06 - it out
07:09 - and then just save it it's whatever help
07:11 - text you really want to put into it okay
07:13 - so next you're gonna wanna make a div
07:16 - you're going to give it the class the
07:18 - same one as the one up here you can just
07:20 - copy it and paste
07:24 - save it you're going to put a label
07:29 - and you're just gonna put password
07:33 - required
07:38 - and then after that you're gonna put an
07:39 - input
07:42 - and you're gonna put the type as pass
07:45 - word
07:47 - make sure the label is outside
07:50 - on the very end
07:54 - make sure you add an
07:56 - id and set it to password
08:00 - and you can set the placeholder to
08:02 - whatever you want
08:03 - as long as it looks like a password so
08:05 - like um
08:08 - like let's say if this was a password
08:10 - and we're gonna do the same thing we did
08:12 - up here
08:13 - with the
08:15 - area described by so we're just gonna
08:17 - copy this
08:19 - and paste it down here and then we're
08:22 - gonna write after it required and we
08:24 - could take out these name and values
08:26 - because we don't need them
08:27 - and after that we're going to put a span
08:32 - and
08:35 - add a class to it
08:39 - and in that class we're going to call it
08:41 - form
08:42 - air
08:43 - and then we're just going to put i'm
08:46 - required
08:49 - make sure your span and label end after
08:51 - that if you want you can indent them and
08:54 - after the span and label we're going to
08:55 - put a paragraph tag we're going to give
08:57 - it the class as help text
09:05 - and then we're going to give them the id
09:08 - as example
09:10 - help text
09:11 - camel cased
09:12 - inside of this we're going to put enter
09:15 - a
09:15 - password
09:18 - please
09:22 - now if you open it up in your browser
09:24 - the html file
09:26 - you see you get these two uh input
09:28 - fields in here now if you're the type in
09:30 - something other than numbers let's say
09:32 - abc and press enter
09:34 - it's going to say yo you forgot
09:36 - something
09:37 - and if you go to this password area and
09:39 - you just press enter
09:43 - it's going to say i'm required
09:45 - so
09:47 - it basically validates your form to make
09:48 - sure there's an input now these are just
09:50 - placeholders but other than the
09:53 - placeholders it's pretty much empty and
09:56 - you press enter and it says i'm required
09:58 - and if you put letters inside of the
10:00 - numbers
10:01 - it's gonna say you forgot something in
10:03 - your form
10:07 - so that's just some simple form
10:09 - validation for numbers and passwords you
10:11 - can always just change it as you see in
10:13 - the code it's pretty much a pattern
10:15 - up here
10:17 - and we can even add a comment right here
10:21 - um we just say uh about
10:26 - error message
10:31 - ballot
10:39 - right here and this is basically what
10:41 - validates it
10:42 - and then down here
10:47 - is the number
10:49 - valid
10:50 - date
10:53 - and then after that there is the
11:00 - password
11:02 - validate
11:05 - and basically what you can do is you can
11:06 - copy any of these and just change the
11:09 - classes and stuff you can always check
11:11 - the foundation website too it'll also
11:13 - tell you how to change it but these are
11:16 - just some simple form validation for uh
11:18 - foundation
11:20 - okay so up next is the accordion menu or
11:23 - just the accordion and so we're just
11:25 - gonna add a comment down here
11:27 - we're just gonna call it
11:40 - and i'm just gonna tab it down here so
11:43 - basically what we're gonna first do is
11:44 - put it in an unordered list
11:46 - and we're gonna put a class up here
11:48 - we're gonna call it accordion
11:52 - and then
11:54 - we're gonna put a data value called
11:56 - data
11:58 - core in
12:04 - inside of here we're going to put a list
12:06 - item tag and then we're going to give it
12:08 - class name
12:10 - called
12:11 - accordion
12:13 - item
12:14 - is
12:15 - active
12:17 - and then we're just going to give it a
12:18 - javascript value called data
12:22 - accordion item
12:25 - after that we're going to put a link so
12:27 - we're just going to type in a
12:28 - an anchor tag we're going to give it a
12:30 - class
12:33 - and we're going to give it the class
12:34 - called accordion
12:37 - title we're just gonna call this one
12:39 - accordion
12:41 - one
12:42 - and then after that we're gonna put
12:44 - a div
12:45 - we're gonna give this one a class called
12:47 - accordion
12:49 - dash content
12:53 - and then we're going to give it a
12:54 - javascript value called data
12:56 - dash tab dash content
12:59 - and then after this we're going to put a
13:01 - paragraph tag
13:04 - and we're gonna go give it a class
13:10 - next we're gonna put a paragraph tag
13:12 - and we're just gonna say hello
13:15 - world for this one and then we're just
13:17 - gonna put a link and we're just going to
13:20 - put
13:21 - link in it and it's just going to be an
13:23 - empty link
13:25 - now if we go to our website and reload
13:27 - we get this little panel right here but
13:29 - as you see there's only one so we're
13:31 - going to go back into our code and copy
13:33 - and paste it so we get more accordions
13:37 - so see we're back in here and we're
13:38 - going to copy and paste
13:41 - all of this
13:43 - actually we're only going to copy and
13:44 - paste what's inside of the list item
13:48 - we're just going to do it three times
13:51 - and then at the end you're just gonna
13:52 - put the closing tag for the unordered
13:54 - list
13:55 - and then if you go back to your code you
13:57 - see here you can minimize each tab
14:01 - so it's like an accordion and you can
14:03 - open them up by going like this
14:07 - it's pretty cool so we so we're gonna
14:08 - customize it a little bit more so
14:10 - instead of this being panel one
14:12 - we're gonna put panel two we're gonna
14:14 - take out this uh dummy text
14:19 - and we're gonna call this one panel
14:23 - two this one back to panel one
14:25 - this one panel three we're gonna take
14:27 - out all this dummy text
14:34 - and now if we go back to it
14:36 - we reload
14:38 - we get all of these
14:42 - where it's like this and we can
14:45 - customize it even more
14:46 - changing these
14:50 - i'm saving it
14:52 - and then we reload and you see you get
14:54 - it all organized with its content inside
14:57 - of it so accordion one panel one they're
14:59 - just empty links
15:02 - and you can open up each one and it
15:04 - gives you a new panel now up next are
15:07 - something called badges
15:09 - badges are
15:10 - an interesting kind of
15:12 - uh element inside of foundation so i'm
15:14 - just gonna show you what they are
15:17 - so let's just put a comment
15:20 - saying
15:21 - badges
15:27 - and we're gonna make a span tag
15:30 - we're gonna give it a class
15:32 - we're gonna call it primary
15:35 - badge and inside of that we're just
15:37 - gonna put
15:38 - the letter a as capitalized so we can
15:41 - view it
15:42 - and if you go over to your browser and
15:44 - you click reload
15:46 - you see down here
15:51 - down in the bottom left corner of your
15:53 - screen you should see the letter a and
15:56 - tying up inside of a little circle
16:00 - now
16:02 - we can copy this code
16:05 - make another version of it
16:10 - instead of primary we can do something
16:11 - called secondary
16:17 - secondary badge and then we can just put
16:20 - a b go back to the page and reload
16:24 - you get this
16:28 - you get this gray badge down here
16:57 - do
17:17 - now i've added a a div that has a margin
17:20 - bottom of 200 pixels just so you guys
17:21 - can view the badges easily
17:23 - now if we go down here and make another
17:25 - span or copy and paste it instead of
17:28 - primary or secondary we're going to do
17:30 - warning
17:32 - and then we're going to put this one
17:34 - with a c
17:35 - save it go to your web page
17:39 - and click reload and you'll get a yellow
17:41 - one with the letter c inside of it
17:45 - now if you go back to your code make
17:47 - another one there's also another class
17:49 - called
17:50 - alert
17:52 - and alert badge and
17:54 - success badge
17:58 - and if you reload you see you have all
18:00 - different colors of badges and the
18:02 - purpose of a badge
18:04 - is kind of like when something goes
18:05 - successfully or some sort of warning it
18:07 - shows up this badge next to like some
18:10 - words saying your form did not validate
18:13 - and it's
18:14 - has a red badge to it it can signify
18:16 - something about your form or about
18:18 - something you're trying to fill out
18:21 - these are also just great little
18:23 - decorations but if i zoom out
18:25 - to
18:26 - normal you can almost barely see them
18:29 - and i don't know why that is i don't
18:32 - think it's meant for reading i think i
18:34 - think it's meant just for the color and
18:36 - for signifying that something's not
18:38 - correctly filled out so up next we have
18:40 - buttons and we're just going to start
18:42 - off by putting a comment saying buttons
18:46 - or just button
18:50 - we're going to start off by obviously
18:51 - making a button
18:52 - and we're going to keep the type as
18:54 - button but we're going to take away the
18:57 - the name of the button
19:00 - because we don't need the name then
19:01 - we're going to give it a class
19:03 - called button now if you look at your uh
19:06 - website and you reload it you see down
19:08 - here you get an empty blue box that's
19:11 - because you have to put text inside of
19:13 - it so we're just gonna put
19:15 - button
19:16 - and if you go back
19:18 - and reload
19:20 - you see you have a button down here
19:23 - now i'm gonna add that padding back in
19:25 - here
19:35 - just so that we can get so you can see
19:37 - it clearly
19:39 - we reload
19:40 - as you see it's down here now you can
19:42 - give each button a type of class that
19:44 - changes the color or look of the button
19:47 - so for example if we copy this
19:49 - paste it and put
19:53 - a second or um
19:56 - success
19:57 - button
20:02 - and you reload it gives you a blue
20:04 - button
20:05 - if we were to paste it again and say
20:08 - alert
20:10 - button with a space
20:12 - and reload it you would get a red one
20:14 - you can also do the same for uh sizing
20:16 - so you can do
20:18 - tiny
20:19 - button
20:21 - and it gives you a tinier button
20:25 - or you could do
20:30 - a large
20:31 - button
20:33 - will give you even bigger button
20:41 - and you can even do things like expanded
20:43 - button so if we go to the class and put
20:46 - expanded
20:48 - button
20:50 - reload you see it takes up the whole
20:51 - width of the screen you can also have a
20:54 - small button too so it's in between the
20:56 - tiny and large button
20:58 - so if you just put small button and you
21:00 - reload you get this medium sized button
21:03 - and these are basically all the buttons
21:05 - obviously they're not linked to anything
21:07 - because we didn't uh
21:09 - put a hyper reference into here but you
21:11 - can link these two different things such
21:13 - as exists
21:15 - such as a success page or
21:18 - an error page take up the whole bottom
21:20 - of a
21:21 - portfolio object
21:24 - or you can just have different sizing
21:26 - buttons and colors they all have
21:28 - automatic hover and whenever it's like a
21:30 - green button or a black button it'll
21:32 - turn to white text or black text
21:35 - next we're going to do something called
21:36 - call outs now callouts are like little
21:38 - messages that show up on your screen
21:40 - they're not really messages they're more
21:41 - like sections so i'ma show you what they
21:43 - are and how they're useful
21:47 - now we're gonna um
21:49 - just put a comment like always
21:51 - and we're gonna just call this call out
21:54 - and then just indent it here
21:58 - and then we're gonna make a div and
22:00 - we're gonna have the class as call out
22:05 - we're gonna put an h5
22:09 - and we're just gonna say hello
22:11 - world
22:13 - and then we're gonna put a paragraph tag
22:15 - we're just gonna say this is a call out
22:19 - we're gonna save it
22:20 - and you know just for fun we're gonna
22:22 - put a link
22:24 - we're just gonna say link
22:27 - now if we go to our browser you see down
22:30 - here we have a call out it's just a
22:32 - simple little section that we have that
22:34 - says hello world this is a call out and
22:36 - a link which does nothing
22:38 - and
22:39 - but what we can do with it is we can
22:41 - change it so let's copy this
22:48 - and we're going to set um actually
22:51 - just copy the
22:53 - the callout part not the um
22:55 - the margin
22:56 - we're gonna do call out warning
23:01 - and it gives us this yellow call out now
23:03 - we can do this for success and alert too
23:06 - so if we do
23:09 - call out
23:11 - success
23:13 - and
23:14 - call out
23:15 - alert
23:17 - and we reload you get the green one and
23:20 - the red one which are just basically um
23:24 - like
23:25 - like the buttons and the badges success
23:27 - and
23:28 - um warning
23:29 - now there's also a secondary one that
23:32 - shows the gray if we um
23:34 - but call out
23:36 - suck on dairy
23:37 - we save it we reload you get this
23:39 - grayish kind of one
23:42 - now another thing too about this is
23:44 - there's also a primary one where you can
23:45 - set it back to its default called calm
23:48 - call out primary
23:50 - and if you save and you reload you get
23:52 - back to this blue one there's the
23:53 - difference between just call out and
23:55 - call out primary and secondary obviously
23:58 - alert warning and success are completely
24:00 - different but you always have to watch
24:02 - out for these um these class changes
24:06 - so in foundation there's
24:08 - things called close boxes or just
24:10 - closeouts what you can basically do with
24:12 - them is you can add them to callouts for
24:14 - example
24:15 - and you can be able to close out of a
24:17 - call out and wipe it from your screen
24:19 - and i'm going to show you how to do that
24:20 - so what you're going to want to do is
24:21 - you're going to want to add a data value
24:23 - after your class called
24:25 - data
24:27 - dash close
24:30 - level
24:32 - then after that you're going to want to
24:33 - add a button
24:35 - so just type in a button
24:37 - and you can keep the type as button
24:39 - and you can take out the name
24:43 - you're going to add a data value to this
24:45 - called data close
24:49 - we're going to add an area label before
24:51 - the data close so area
24:54 - dash
24:56 - label
24:58 - i'm going to set that equal to
25:02 - you're gonna write close
25:05 - alert
25:08 - and you're gonna give it a class called
25:09 - close button
25:22 - and save the file
25:24 - after this you're going to make a span
25:28 - inside of the first span tag you need to
25:30 - put area
25:31 - dash
25:32 - hidden
25:34 - and you can set it equal to true
25:36 - colon
25:38 - and then save the file now you're going
25:40 - to want to put this span you're going to
25:42 - copy it
25:46 - and then you're going to put it
25:48 - inside of the closed i mean
25:50 - you're going to put it inside of the
25:51 - button
25:54 - and then you're going to save
25:55 - now if you go to your website now if you
25:58 - check your web browser you should see
25:59 - this little x over here and when you
26:02 - click it
26:03 - it just disappears now when you reload
26:06 - the page
26:07 - it obviously comes back because it's not
26:09 - saved into your local data or caches but
26:12 - there's a way you can do that but you
26:14 - can basically exit out of any call out
26:17 - you want just by adding those data
26:18 - variables and the classes now make sure
26:21 - you do wrap the variables into the div
26:24 - so make sure there's one large div
26:25 - around the whole thing like in here i
26:27 - added a div so it would close off the
26:30 - call out make sure you put a div so you
26:32 - close out the call out and the close
26:34 - button
26:35 - and the span and yeah basically that's
26:38 - how you add an exit out button or a
26:41 - a closeout tab on any call out okay so
26:45 - up next we're going to do a drop down
26:46 - pane
26:47 - now drop down pane is basically where
26:49 - you click the button
26:51 - and it shows a little message below it
26:53 - these can be used for many things such
26:55 - as errors with badges or
26:57 - panels you can use this as a little help
26:59 - text so we're gonna i'm gonna show you
27:01 - how to do this
27:03 - so first we're gonna scroll down
27:05 - after all the call outs we're gonna make
27:07 - a comment
27:09 - or tab it in
27:11 - and we're gonna call it drop down
27:14 - pane
27:20 - and save it and then first we're going
27:21 - to put a button
27:24 - we're going to leave the type alone
27:26 - we're just going to take out the name so
27:28 - we don't need it
27:30 - we're going to give it a class called
27:31 - button
27:33 - so class
27:35 - button this just gives primary button
27:37 - standards
27:38 - we're gonna put data
27:40 - dash toggle
27:42 - and set it equal to
27:45 - we're gonna name it to example
27:47 - dash drop down
27:52 - and now inside of this button we're just
27:54 - gonna put
27:55 - um
27:57 - drop
27:58 - actually we're just gonna say toggle
28:02 - drop
28:03 - down
28:05 - and after this button we're going to
28:06 - make a div
28:11 - it's going to have the class drop
28:13 - down
28:14 - dash pane
28:17 - we're going to give it the id
28:18 - of example
28:21 - dash drop down and then we're going to
28:23 - give it data dash drop
28:26 - down and then we're just going to call
28:28 - this one
28:28 - drop down
28:31 - pain
28:33 - and if we go to our website this should
28:35 - be working
28:37 - and down in the bottom right you should
28:38 - see this little button saying toggle
28:40 - drop down
28:41 - if you click it and scroll down you get
28:43 - this little text bubble saying drop down
28:45 - pane
28:46 - now if we center this it works a little
28:48 - easier and if we add padding so we're
28:50 - going to do that just to show for a full
28:51 - example
28:54 - now we're going to give this um
28:57 - now we're going to put this in inside of
28:59 - the larger div so we're going to put div
29:02 - we're going to copy all of this
29:06 - inside of here
29:08 - and we're going to just um we're not
29:10 - going to give this a class we're just
29:11 - going to do inline styling
29:13 - we're going to do um
29:15 - display
29:17 - flex
29:22 - and then we're going to do just if i
29:24 - dash
29:25 - content
29:27 - center
29:29 - and text dash align
29:32 - center
29:36 - and we're just going to add
29:40 - margin
29:42 - 15 pixels
29:44 - if we save this this should give it a
29:45 - nice look to it so as you see it has
29:48 - pretty good but we're going to add some
29:49 - more margin to it so that it centers
29:52 - more up
29:54 - we're just going to say 25
29:57 - and if you reload
29:59 - it looks nicer now if you click it you
30:01 - get this little text below it saying
30:03 - drop down pane
30:05 - now if we want to see the full example
30:07 - we're going to add about
30:09 - 50 and then we're just going to do from
30:11 - margin we're going to do margin bottom
30:13 - that way we get what we want we reload
30:16 - we click
30:18 - it says drop down pane
30:20 - and we've clicked the button again it
30:21 - goes away just like a help text or an
30:24 - error
30:25 - so up next is floating classes and we're
30:27 - going to be floating buttons to left or
30:29 - right so first we're going to add
30:31 - a comment and we're going to just say
30:35 - flow
30:38 - buttons we're going to put floating
30:40 - buttons
30:41 - and then just indent it a little
30:43 - and then what you're going to do first
30:45 - is just put you're going to put button
30:47 - you're going to take out the type
30:51 - and you're gonna actually you can keep
30:52 - the type you're gonna take out the name
30:56 - you're gonna add class
31:00 - as just button
31:03 - then you're gonna put
31:05 - a space and then float dash left
31:09 - and then you're gonna put inside of the
31:10 - button just some text saying float
31:13 - left and if you go to your browser you
31:14 - should have a button floating to the
31:16 - left now as you see down here you have a
31:18 - button floating to the left also you
31:19 - don't always have to use just the normal
31:21 - um
31:22 - primary button you can always go like
31:25 - you can always go
31:27 - uh
31:28 - success button
31:32 - and make it a green button or even a an
31:34 - alert button so alert button
31:38 - left
31:40 - and then you can just copy this
31:45 - and let's say we want this to be a
31:47 - success button
31:50 - and we're just going to make it float to
31:52 - the right
31:54 - we're just going to change the text
31:56 - saying right
31:57 - we go back to our tab
31:59 - reload you have a green button floating
32:01 - on the right
32:02 - and a red button floating on the left
32:05 - and those are basically the floating
32:06 - classes for buttons so up next are
32:09 - labels and
32:11 - labels are basically almost like the
32:13 - badges but you can actually put a word
32:15 - inside of them and be able to read the
32:17 - word so i'm gonna show you what that is
32:19 - so we're gonna make a comment and we're
32:21 - just gonna put
32:23 - labels
32:26 - and then indent so what you're going to
32:28 - first want to do is you're going to put
32:29 - a span you're going to give it a class
32:31 - called
32:32 - primary
32:35 - label
32:36 - and then inside of that you're going to
32:37 - put primary
32:42 - label
32:44 - and then you save it if you go to your
32:46 - browser
32:47 - as you see at the bottom you see this
32:48 - little blue thing called primary label
32:51 - now if we go back
32:54 - and we copy it and you can put things
32:56 - like
32:57 - success
33:00 - and just keep pasting it you can do um
33:03 - you copy it and you can paste it you can
33:05 - put
33:06 - um
33:07 - warning
33:11 - you could put
33:12 - alert
33:15 - and you can even do um secondary
33:20 - if you save it and go view it in your
33:21 - browser
33:23 - you see in the bottom left you have all
33:25 - these labels right here and they're not
33:26 - buttons so you can't really click on
33:28 - them and expect to go somewhere the more
33:30 - like the badges where they're just there
33:31 - to show you like a message of some sort
33:33 - but like a very small message
33:35 - such as success or virus or hello
33:39 - so they're they're kind of useful but
33:41 - sometimes they're not so up next we're
33:43 - doing off campuses now off campuses are
33:46 - those things you
33:47 - kind of see when you're on mobile
33:49 - devices so for example you're trying to
33:51 - look at the menu but you're on your
33:52 - phone you usually have it off canvas
33:55 - appear and it's the three little lines
33:56 - that you click on opens up a side canvas
33:59 - or an off canvas
34:00 - and also referred to as off menus or
34:04 - side menus we're going to learn how to
34:05 - make one of those in foundation first
34:07 - you're going to start off with div tags
34:08 - obviously you're going to give it a
34:10 - class called off
34:11 - dash canvas
34:13 - dash
34:14 - wrapper
34:16 - and you're going to give it another div
34:17 - and the class is going to be off canvas
34:22 - enter
34:24 - off canvas
34:25 - wrapper
34:26 - dash inner you're going to save that i'm
34:30 - going to give it the data type
34:32 - data
34:34 - off
34:38 - wrapper
34:39 - after this you're going to put another
34:40 - div and you're going to give this one a
34:42 - class name of off dash can
34:45 - s
34:46 - position
34:51 - dash left
34:52 - you're going to add an id
34:54 - called off
34:56 - canvas
34:58 - left and then you're going to add data
35:01 - off dash off dash
35:04 - and this
35:06 - and then after all that we're going to
35:07 - leave those divs empty for now after
35:09 - that
35:10 - they're going to add a button
35:13 - you're going to take out the name
35:15 - like we usually do
35:17 - i'm gonna give it a class
35:22 - we're just gonna
35:23 - put it as the button class or the
35:25 - primary button
35:26 - we're gonna add
35:28 - data
35:30 - toggle we're going to set it equal to
35:33 - off
35:34 - can this
35:36 - left and then we're just going to put in
35:38 - here
35:40 - open or we're just going to put uh off
35:43 - canvas
35:45 - forgot to add the comment so we're just
35:47 - gonna add that really quick or just say
35:49 - off
35:50 - cam
35:52 - this
35:54 - save it now if you go to your browser
35:56 - you should see this button down here and
35:57 - when you click it it gives you this off
35:59 - canvas kind of look but it has no
36:01 - content inside of that so we're going to
36:02 - add that really quick so over here in
36:05 - these inner divs all the way into the
36:06 - middle we're just going to put an h2 tag
36:10 - and we're just say hello
36:12 - world
36:15 - and then we're just gonna put an h4 just
36:18 - saying
36:18 - docs or we're just put html
36:24 - and then another h4 saying css
36:35 - um just another one
36:37 - called java script and save that
36:43 - reload and we click off canvas and gives
36:45 - us this little side menu we could bank
36:47 - we can make these links too just by
36:52 - adding opening and closing tags to the
36:54 - very ends copying and pasting them
37:08 - adding placeholders as hashtags
37:14 - save it
37:15 - and you reload
37:17 - and now they're links and you click on
37:18 - them and it just brings you back to the
37:21 - top of the page
37:23 - open it and this is just these are just
37:27 - links and this is an off campus menu but
37:29 - when you minimize it if we inspect and
37:32 - we go to
37:34 - mobile let's just go to a google pixel
37:36 - 2.
37:37 - when we click
37:38 - off canvas it looks like one of those
37:41 - menus that you would have for a phone
37:43 - so and this works on any phone we can go
37:45 - all the way down to an uh
37:47 - an iphone 5se and it still works which
37:50 - are usually the smaller phones so it's
37:52 - good to know that these still work on
37:54 - all devices so up next is pagnation now
37:58 - pagnation is like a type of navigation
38:00 - that hangs out at the bottom and you can
38:02 - go through multiple pages
38:04 - usually at the bottom of product pages
38:06 - or blog pages you can go through
38:08 - multiple pages without having to
38:09 - navigate through the top navigation bar
38:12 - i'm going to show you how to do that
38:13 - down here we're just going to make a
38:15 - another comment as usual just so we can
38:18 - divide up our code
38:25 - we're just going to say pagnation bar
38:28 - indented a little
38:30 - and then we're gonna start off with an
38:32 - unordered list give it a class
38:35 - of
38:36 - tag and nation we're gonna give it a
38:39 - roll
38:40 - and set it equal to navigation and then
38:43 - we're gonna put area
38:46 - and then
38:47 - set it equal to
38:48 - pagination with the capital p inside of
38:51 - this we're going to put in list item
38:54 - we're going to give it a class
38:56 - called disable
38:59 - inside of this we're going to put
39:00 - previous and inside of this
39:03 - uh list item we're going to put a span
39:05 - tag
39:13 - we're gonna give it a class
39:15 - called show dash
39:18 - four dash sr and then we're just gonna
39:20 - put page in between this span tag and we
39:23 - could just close off the ends like that
39:25 - and then after this you're gonna you're
39:27 - gonna copy this
39:30 - and paste it below you're gonna change
39:32 - the class name to current
39:37 - actually you're not gonna put any you're
39:39 - not gonna put anything between those so
39:40 - you're gonna take out the previous
39:42 - you're gonna just put you are
39:45 - on or on
39:47 - page and then in between the span and
39:49 - the list item you're just gonna put one
39:51 - after that you're gonna put another list
39:52 - item list item
39:54 - you're just gonna put a list item a link
39:55 - inside of this
39:57 - you're going to set it to just the
39:59 - hashtag as the placeholder you put area
40:01 - label
40:05 - and set it equal to page
40:07 - two in between you're gonna just put a
40:09 - two between the anchor tag and then
40:11 - you're just gonna copy and paste this
40:15 - and you're just gonna change the numbers
40:16 - from two to three
40:18 - to four
40:20 - and you can just take out this last one
40:21 - we only need to go to
40:22 - four you can change this to
40:25 - three
40:27 - four so next you're gonna add a list
40:29 - item you're gonna give it a class of
40:31 - ellipse
40:37 - and you're gonna do it area
40:40 - hidden
40:42 - equal
40:44 - you're gonna just do true
40:46 - and you're just gonna leave this as that
40:49 - and you're gonna copy just two of these
40:52 - and then you just put in for now we'll
40:54 - just put uh
40:56 - pages 12
40:57 - and
40:58 - 13.
40:59 - we're going to change this for that
41:04 - after that you're going to copy this
41:07 - this item right here
41:09 - you're going to paste it you're going to
41:11 - set the area labeled to capital next
41:13 - space page make sure the page is not
41:17 - capitalized and then after that instead
41:18 - of 13 you're just gonna put next and
41:20 - then you're gonna copy this uh span
41:22 - right here
41:25 - you're gonna paste it after next
41:29 - instead of uh putting you are on page
41:32 - you're just gonna put page if you reload
41:34 - your web page you should get this down
41:36 - here that looks like a little navigation
41:39 - that you would have for a website as you
41:41 - see the disabled class works perfectly
41:43 - with previous and then you can go on to
41:45 - next pages and stuff except for we only
41:47 - have one page so it's not going to go
41:48 - anywhere but uh we're going to style it
41:51 - stylize this a little bit more so
41:53 - you go to your um unordered list we're
41:56 - going to add a style tag we're going to
41:58 - say display
42:01 - flex
42:03 - and then we're gonna put justify
42:06 - content
42:08 - and then we're gonna set it to center
42:12 - and if we go back to our web browser
42:15 - we reload it it should be in the middle
42:17 - just like most web pages would look like
42:19 - now flexbox does work pretty well with
42:22 - uh foundation i haven't found any errors
42:24 - with it
42:25 - as you can see i easily centered that
42:27 - div or that um unordered list into the
42:29 - middle with no problem so foundation
42:31 - does work pretty well with uh flexbox
42:35 - and this is uh what a pagnation looks
42:36 - like on a web browser and that's how you
42:39 - make it in foundation so up next is
42:41 - progress bars now um
42:43 - just a disclaimer in my opinion bulma's
42:46 - uh
42:47 - progress bars are much better than
42:49 - foundations but we're still gonna learn
42:51 - them anyway just to see the difference
42:53 - between the two so let's just go ahead
42:55 - and make them um you're gonna go down
42:57 - here just make a comment
43:00 - uh progress
43:08 - and then down here you're gonna make a
43:09 - div
43:10 - you're gonna give it a class of primary
43:13 - progress
43:16 - save that and you're going to go inside
43:19 - so inside of this div you're going to
43:20 - make another dip and you're going to put
43:21 - the class name at progress
43:25 - meter
43:26 - and then style
43:28 - with
43:30 - 25
43:32 - inside of this you're going to put
43:36 - paragraph tag
43:38 - you're going to put 25 percent you're
43:40 - gonna give this paragraph tag a class
43:42 - it's gonna be progress
43:45 - dash meter
43:47 - dash text
43:48 - and this is gonna be all there is to
43:50 - your progress bar now if you check your
43:52 - browser now if you check your browser
43:54 - you see you have this progress bar in
43:56 - here
43:56 - and
43:57 - you can customize it even more with the
43:59 - warning and success labels as here
44:02 - all we have to do is copy it
44:07 - and we just put a warning
44:10 - progress when we reload it we have a
44:12 - yellow one
44:13 - we do this the same for
44:16 - alert
44:19 - and we could do this the same for
44:22 - success
44:24 - and if we reload you have all these
44:26 - different colors there is not a
44:28 - secondary one because the background's
44:29 - already gray so it'd be kind of useless
44:32 - you wouldn't be able to tell the
44:33 - difference between the progress so they
44:35 - just decided not to have a secondary one
44:38 - now the ways you change the the progress
44:40 - on the bars is you go up to this width
44:42 - styling and you just change it to
44:44 - whatever percent you want and then down
44:46 - here in the paragraph you want to change
44:48 - it to match that so this primary
44:49 - progress should now be at 50
44:52 - change any of these so we change this to
44:56 - 65
45:00 - change this one to
45:02 - 3 percent
45:06 - and yeah basically if we reload you have
45:09 - all different types of widths and stuff
45:11 - and different colors for different types
45:13 - of labeling
45:15 - and yeah that's basically it for
45:16 - progress bars
45:17 - so um next are switches now switches are
45:20 - kind of pointless without a back end but
45:22 - i'm still going to show you the front
45:23 - end and how they're used in foundation
45:28 - so first we're going to make a comment
45:30 - right as always
45:33 - my foundation
45:35 - uh switch
45:38 - and then we're gonna save that we're
45:40 - gonna make a div we're gonna give this a
45:42 - class called tiny
45:44 - switch
45:46 - we're gonna put an input we're gonna
45:48 - give this a class of
45:51 - switch
45:53 - dash input and save it we're gonna give
45:56 - it an id
45:57 - of
45:58 - tiny switch
46:01 - and then we're going to change the type
46:03 - from text
46:05 - to check
46:07 - box and we're going to change the name
46:08 - to
46:09 - example
46:11 - switch
46:12 - and we can take out the value as well
46:15 - now after that we're gonna put a label
46:16 - we're gonna add a class to it and this
46:18 - one's gonna be called switch
46:20 - dash
46:22 - paddle
46:23 - let's save that and then we're gonna put
46:25 - four
46:26 - small switch
46:28 - we're gonna put a span inside of the
46:30 - label
46:33 - we're gonna give it a class
46:35 - it's gonna be show dash
46:38 - four dash sr and inside of this we're
46:41 - going to put small
46:42 - porsche
46:44 - only
46:45 - we're going to capitalize each of these
46:47 - and this should basically give you a
46:50 - switch now if you go ahead and check
46:51 - your browser
46:53 - so in your browser you're going to see
46:54 - this little switch down here and it
46:56 - this is all it does
46:58 - kind of uh misleading but it still looks
47:01 - cool to play with click it a million
47:03 - times if you'd like
47:04 - with some back end i guess it'd be kind
47:06 - of cool you can fill it out as a form
47:08 - so like yes no yes no
47:12 - now you can also add different classes
47:14 - so that you can make them bigger or
47:15 - smaller
47:16 - so we're basically going to copy this
47:21 - we're going to paste it down here we're
47:23 - going to change every tiny
47:25 - too small so we're just going to go
47:27 - ahead and
47:30 - take every tiny
47:33 - we're going to go
47:34 - small
47:36 - and then save it and if you reload you
47:38 - have another one that's slightly bigger
47:40 - than the first one and we do the same
47:42 - thing and make it bigger we're just
47:43 - going to copy this
47:47 - and we're going to find everywhere where
47:48 - it says small
47:52 - and the way i'm doing this is i'm
47:53 - holding ctrl while i'm clicking
47:57 - and you're just going to backspace and
48:00 - put
48:00 - large
48:05 - and you're going to save that you're
48:06 - going to reload and you're going to have
48:07 - a very large button
48:09 - or switch
48:11 - and this is basically how switches work
48:13 - in foundation up next we're going to
48:15 - make tables now tables look a little
48:17 - different in
48:18 - uh foundation and i'll you'll see why in
48:21 - a minute but uh we're just gonna go
48:22 - ahead and start making that now so
48:25 - obviously
48:26 - you know the drill we're just gonna make
48:28 - some
48:30 - comment
48:32 - so we can keep organized
48:38 - and
48:39 - then and then you're gonna put a table
48:41 - tag
48:43 - just like that
48:44 - and then t head or table head and then
48:48 - we're going to make a table row
48:50 - now we're going to make a table header
48:51 - we're going to give it a width
48:55 - of 200.
48:57 - we're just going to name this table
48:59 - header and then we're going to do
49:01 - another table header we're just gonna
49:03 - add no width to this and just say
49:05 - table
49:07 - header now we're gonna copy and paste
49:09 - this one
49:11 - twice
49:13 - we're gonna change this one to 150 we're
49:16 - going to change
49:18 - this one the 150 as well
49:21 - now after the table head we're going to
49:22 - make a table body
49:25 - and then we're going to make a table row
49:26 - and then table data
49:28 - and inside of this data we're gonna put
49:30 - just some text some filler text so we're
49:32 - just gonna say content
49:35 - goes here
49:38 - and next one we're just gonna do table
49:40 - data
49:41 - lorem ispium and we're just gonna
49:44 - minimize this down a little bit
49:51 - so it's not too long and then we can
49:52 - just copy this one
49:56 - and paste it twice over there and after
49:58 - that we're gonna copy this
50:01 - and paste it three more times
50:04 - or two more times as you see we have a
50:06 - perfectly made table over here you see
50:09 - the first row goes gray or a light gray
50:12 - the second one goes full white and then
50:14 - it's a pattern after that
50:16 - and basically what we did is we made one
50:18 - with a certain amount of width and
50:20 - basically organizes it like in a css
50:23 - grid so that it goes one
50:25 - large and then two small ones and this
50:28 - is basically how a table works in
50:30 - foundation
50:31 - so up next is the title bar now the
50:33 - title bar is very responsive navigation
50:36 - usually used on mobile and web apps
50:40 - or mobile websites when you're designing
50:42 - for mobile first they usually have the
50:44 - little cutout on the side where the
50:46 - breadcrumbs that you can easily navigate
50:48 - through and they're very responsive so
50:50 - i'm gonna show you how to make one in
50:51 - foundation
50:53 - so just going to make comment title
50:56 - bar
50:58 - like that
51:01 - indent and then you're going to give it
51:03 - a class called title dash bar
51:08 - inside of there you're gonna make
51:09 - another div and it's gonna be called
51:11 - title dash r gosh left because we're
51:15 - gonna make it to the left we're gonna
51:16 - put a button we're gonna leave the type
51:18 - as button but we can take out the name
51:22 - we're gonna give it a class
51:26 - we're gonna call this menu
51:31 - icon we're gonna put a span after this
51:36 - this is going to have a class called
51:38 - title dash bar
51:40 - left inside of here we're just going to
51:42 - put foundation and then
51:44 - after that div inside of the title bar
51:47 - div but not inside of the title bar left
51:49 - we're gonna make another div we're gonna
51:51 - call this one title
51:53 - dash bar
51:54 - dash right
51:56 - we're gonna put a button
51:58 - we're gonna take out the name
52:02 - we're gonna put a class in here we
52:04 - called menu
52:06 - i put a dash in between and this should
52:08 - give you your little title bar and if
52:09 - you check your browser should have this
52:11 - little title bar now you want to uh
52:14 - obviously put at the top of your web
52:15 - page so it looks like a title now i
52:17 - added some margins so it looks like it's
52:18 - at the top of the page it's really not
52:20 - it's just
52:22 - uh it's just some margin but it looks
52:24 - like it's at the top of a page and this
52:26 - is basically what it looks like the
52:27 - pages don't do anything but you can
52:29 - actually connect the off canvas to those
52:32 - um those
52:34 - to the menu icons and they can open up
52:37 - side menus especially if you're on
52:38 - mobile that can be useful and this is
52:40 - all responsive if i were to go like this
52:44 - it's all responsive there's not much to
52:46 - respond about but
52:48 - it it's still responsive if you have
52:50 - actual navigations inside of this black
52:53 - bar right here
52:54 - it becomes responsive
52:56 - and yeah that's basically how you make a
52:58 - navigation slash title bar in foundation
53:00 - so up next is a tool tip and a tool tip
53:03 - is like um you'll see them in wikipedia
53:05 - a lot and it kind of gives you a general
53:08 - definition of a word that the user might
53:10 - not quite understand right away so i'm
53:13 - gonna show you how to do that
53:15 - now we're just gonna make a comment
53:17 - we're gonna call this tool
53:20 - tip
53:22 - and we're gonna make a paragraph tag
53:24 - because it is a sentence and we're just
53:26 - gonna put the
53:28 - and we're going to space it but we're
53:30 - going to take out that space now inside
53:31 - of this paragraph tag we're going to put
53:33 - a span
53:36 - now the span is going to have a data
53:37 - type called data
53:40 - dash tool tip and then it's going to
53:43 - have area
53:44 - that has pop up we're going to set that
53:47 - equal to true we're going to set a class
53:51 - to has dash tip now we're going to say
53:54 - data dash
53:56 - disable dash hover we're going to set
53:59 - that equal to
54:01 - false and then we're going to put tab
54:03 - index
54:04 - and we're going to set tab index equal
54:06 - to 1 and then we're going to put title
54:09 - fantasy
54:10 - word
54:12 - for a
54:13 - beetle
54:17 - and then this is just another word for a
54:19 - beetle i just copied and pasted it and
54:21 - then this is just some filler text i
54:23 - found well we're just going to do laura
54:25 - mistbium we're going to save that and if
54:27 - you go into your browser
54:29 - and you reload you see down here you get
54:31 - the sentence and oops make sure you put
54:33 - a space after the
54:36 - title
54:39 - not a space uh after the uh
54:41 - the definition word and if you reload
54:44 - you get this and when you hover over it
54:46 - says fancy word for a beetle and it's
54:48 - just a basic definition of what it is
54:50 - you'll see these a lot on wikipedia you
54:52 - can add these to your docs on your
54:53 - website or whatever and that's how it
54:55 - works in foundation so up next is
54:57 - something called html templates and
55:00 - foundation foundation has their own set
55:02 - of templates they have a total of eight
55:05 - if you go to foundation.zurb.com
55:08 - templates.html you'll find these html
55:10 - templates now there's a total of eight
55:12 - and you can download any of them or you
55:14 - can just watch the demo they have news
55:17 - magazines real estate e-commerce blogs
55:20 - portfolios and product pages and a few
55:22 - more these are very helpful if you're
55:23 - just trying to create a portfolio for
55:25 - your business or for getting a job and
55:27 - you don't have too much experience and
55:29 - you just need something to get out there
55:30 - with today we're just going to do the
55:32 - portfolio so you're going to click see
55:34 - demo and as you see this is what the
55:36 - portfolio looks like or the template and
55:38 - if we right click and click view page
55:41 - source
55:42 - there's all this code right here we're
55:44 - going to click control a
55:46 - control c
55:47 - so basically what we're going to do is
55:49 - we're going to click control a
55:51 - and control v
55:53 - and you're going to save it now the
55:54 - first thing you're going to notice is
55:56 - everything is in one straight line and
55:59 - nothing is organized like we are
56:00 - organizing it earlier and that's okay
56:03 - you just need an atom package or a
56:05 - package to go along with your code
56:06 - there's gonna be a link in the
56:07 - description it's an atom package called
56:09 - atom beautify and this organizes your
56:11 - code just like we were doing with all
56:13 - the indentations and white space now uh
56:16 - you can install this package just by
56:18 - clicking install and open with atom and
56:21 - it should install like that
56:23 - if not you can uh install using npm um
56:26 - or the apm command line and just install
56:30 - it that way
56:31 - but it's so much easier if you just
56:32 - clicked install here but once you've
56:35 - installed this you should be able to go
56:36 - to your code and click packages adam
56:39 - beautify and then click beautify
56:42 - what this does is it organizes all the
56:44 - code automatically
56:45 - with all of its indentations and stuff
56:48 - now if you go to your file folder and
56:50 - you click your text or your document you
56:53 - should find this as your document not
56:55 - the link anymore
56:57 - and here's where we will reload and edit
57:00 - our website
57:02 - so we can just minimize out of this
57:04 - minimize out of that
57:06 - and the first things we can change is
57:08 - the title we're going to change this to
57:10 - portfolio
57:12 - so
57:13 - portfolio save we can leave all these
57:16 - links alone
57:24 - we can leave all these script tags alone
57:28 - as you see it it just does its own
57:30 - functionality
57:32 - and you see
57:34 - off canvas position left reveal for
57:36 - large this is what the off campus looks
57:38 - like
57:39 - in this website but there's not a button
57:41 - to open it so it's just always open
57:44 - so we're going to edit this uh off
57:45 - canvas first the height is a hundred
57:47 - percent
57:49 - then down here we're just going to
57:50 - change this to
57:52 - liam
57:53 - stockton
57:55 - save that and then this is a little bio
57:57 - it looks like right
58:00 - yeah it's a little bio
58:01 - so i'm gonna copy and paste the bio from
58:04 - my portfolio so this is my portfolio and
58:06 - we're just gonna go to about
58:08 - and i'm gonna just copy this
58:12 - and then i don't need that anymore then
58:14 - we're gonna go down here i'm gonna paste
58:16 - it into this paragraph tag
58:18 - and then if we save it
58:20 - reload i have my own about down here
58:23 - now you can obviously write your own and
58:24 - you probably should
58:26 - and just change the span below to you
58:29 - know
58:30 - stockton save that
58:35 - then down here there's a call out
58:38 - call out primary what this call out is
58:40 - is this thing up here
58:42 - and they set the width so that it takes
58:44 - up the entire
58:46 - um
58:47 - heading basically and so we're going to
58:49 - change this
58:52 - we're going to just change this to
58:54 - x and
59:01 - expand your creativity
59:03 - and it's just going to have some words
59:04 - down here
59:06 - we're just going to change this text to
59:08 - something whatever you really want it's
59:09 - going to come up here so you just can
59:12 - kind of choose what you want to say up
59:14 - here
59:15 - i'm going to just write some stuff so i
59:17 - wrote this just a little phrase right
59:19 - here and if we go ahead and reload you
59:21 - see we get this over here
59:23 - and now we need to move on to the
59:25 - pictures so i pulled an image from my um
59:29 - my personal images and i'ma just paste
59:31 - it into here
59:34 - and we're gonna rename this
59:36 - to
59:37 - me
59:38 - and it's a jpeg file
59:40 - so down in or we're gonna go back up to
59:43 - the image
59:44 - instead of this right here we're just
59:46 - going to do me dot jpg
59:49 - if we reload
59:50 - there's a picture of me up here now
59:53 - now if um as far as these projects go we
59:57 - need to find images for them
59:59 - so over here are basically projects now
60:02 - of course you're not going to have like
60:04 - 12 projects as it's shown here
60:07 - but uh you're going to at least have at
60:09 - least three or four good ones so we're
60:11 - going to take out some of these
60:14 - so if we go down here we're gonna look
60:16 - for it
60:18 - there's all these cells so we can take
60:20 - out the first one two three four
60:23 - five
60:24 - six
60:25 - we'll just take out the first six and
60:28 - save it and we could take out two more
60:29 - because it kind of looks weird actually
60:31 - no
60:32 - we're just gonna uh copy and paste these
60:34 - two
60:36 - paste them back because we need them
60:38 - if we reload you should have only eight
60:41 - and what we're gonna do is we're gonna
60:42 - fill in these projects
60:46 - so we're just gonna put um
60:51 - uh
60:52 - we're just gonna put port
60:53 - folio as a project
60:56 - and then
60:59 - we're gonna make it a link
61:12 - the portfolio is one project
61:15 - we're going to make this one
61:17 - javascript
61:19 - book
61:20 - marker
61:21 - that's another project
61:24 - and we just replace this pasting
61:27 - and we're going to put this one as let's
61:29 - just say
61:31 - personal
61:32 - website
61:36 - or we're going to do a personal
61:39 - blog and we're gonna save that as a
61:41 - website
61:43 - and these are just different projects
61:45 - that i'm filling in as obviously you can
61:47 - come up with your own projects these are
61:48 - just things that i've done
61:56 - javascript
61:58 - um
62:06 - javascript calculator
62:09 - and we're just going to put one here
62:11 - we're just going to put
62:13 - python
62:15 - e logger
62:18 - we need three more
62:20 - word
62:22 - press
62:25 - plug
62:26 - ends
62:30 - actually we need to make this a link so
62:32 - we're gonna do
62:34 - word press
62:38 - plugins
62:41 - down here we're just gonna put uh
62:47 - react
62:49 - js
62:51 - projects
62:53 - and down here we're just going to do u
62:55 - dot js
62:56 - projects
62:58 - if we reload you see we have oops this
63:02 - one is not a link make sure you make
63:04 - them all links
63:05 - because you want to link to your uh
63:07 - project obviously
63:09 - so we're just going to do
63:11 - this
63:12 - reload and you see they're all links
63:14 - they don't go anywhere you can put your
63:16 - own links so i'm gonna just link these
63:18 - so i've linked some of my uh personal
63:20 - projects in here so if we click
63:21 - portfolio you get to my portfolio
63:24 - click javascript bookmarker you get to
63:26 - all my projects
63:27 - now what we need to do is add pictures
63:30 - or thumbnails so that they want to click
63:32 - on them
63:33 - so this is where we go to google
63:36 - images
63:38 - we need to search for port
63:41 - folio
63:43 - we need it
63:44 - um
63:45 - so we're just search for portfolio
63:48 - and then
63:49 - in tools we're gonna click size
63:52 - and then exactly
63:54 - 550
63:55 - by 550
63:57 - because that's what's over in here
63:59 - and it even tells you the pixel size so
64:02 - i found this image it's not really an
64:03 - image of a portfolio but it's going to
64:05 - work for now since it's just a stock
64:07 - image so we're going to right click and
64:09 - click um copy image address and then
64:12 - we're gonna put it in for each of these
64:16 - placehold dot it pictures
64:18 - you're just gonna paste it in
64:21 - and you can even do the control version
64:24 - and just
64:27 - paste it in like that
64:29 - you do it however you want it's just how
64:31 - you paste it in and replace the
64:33 - the thumbnail pictures with this link
64:35 - that we have if we go over and we reload
64:37 - you see we have a bunch of phones and
64:40 - this doesn't look very nice so we're
64:42 - gonna um
64:44 - add some variety to it
64:48 - so we're just gonna keep finding random
64:49 - images and we're just gonna keep copying
64:52 - the image address and replacing them
64:54 - with different
64:55 - uh thumbnails
64:57 - all images will be in the link in the
64:59 - description
65:02 - i'm just finding random images and
65:05 - clicking copy image address and just
65:08 - pasting them in
65:09 - that way it doesn't all look the same we
65:11 - can get some variety to our portfolio
65:16 - as you see if i reload
65:18 - okay so once you're done copying all
65:20 - these images and finding them
65:23 - you should have a variety like this
65:25 - now um if you want to find these images
65:27 - you can find them in the description i
65:29 - found most of them from just google
65:31 - images so it's not that hard to find
65:34 - but do remember that you have to cite
65:36 - and credit each of these authors they're
65:38 - not you can't just take these images you
65:40 - can always put it down in your footer
65:42 - somewhere
65:43 - but uh just make sure you credit these
65:45 - uh people
65:47 - who took the pictures or made the
65:48 - pictures just so you don't get
65:50 - copyrighted claimed or even sued okay so
65:52 - after this you're going to look at this
65:54 - contact me and you're going to want to
65:56 - change uh the text obviously because
65:59 - it's just dummy text we're going to go
66:01 - ahead and change the text so it says
66:04 - contact me and we're going to change out
66:06 - this text
66:07 - so we're just going to say contact me

66:48 - we're not gonna use dribble we're just
66:50 - gonna do youtube
66:54 - instagram
67:00 - and we're gonna do twitter
67:03 - i'm gonna just paste in these links
67:06 - and instagram
67:08 - save that and we go back and we reload
67:10 - you see we have each of these and if you
67:12 - click on them
67:13 - they lead to your social media in this
67:15 - case my youtube channel
67:18 - this form does not work um
67:20 - obviously you need to set up some back
67:22 - end there is a way you can plug in
67:23 - mailchimp into foundations um
67:27 - into foundations uh back in but and for
67:29 - this tutorial we're just doing front end
67:31 - so we're not going to do that but we're
67:32 - going to go ahead and look at the form
67:34 - and you can change the uh
67:36 - placeholder so it says um
67:40 - type
67:41 - here
67:42 - or we can just say message
67:44 - here
67:48 - and if we go back and reload instead of
67:49 - ola designer it's going to say message
67:51 - here
67:53 - now we have a simple portfolio made in
67:55 - foundation right here and it looks
67:58 - pretty good it's pretty good for a
67:59 - starter portfolio even if you don't have
68:01 - much experience with foundation or with
68:03 - any of these
68:04 - you still can make a pretty good
68:06 - portfolio using an html template and
68:08 - foundation you're probably wondering
68:11 - great i can build a website with a
68:13 - template i know all the factors of
68:15 - foundation and all of its responsiveness
68:17 - but how do i build a website from
68:19 - scratch and that's exactly what we're
68:21 - gonna do right now so right now we're
68:23 - going to build a website from scratch so
68:24 - completely no templates no um
68:27 - no copying pasting all just pure code so
68:30 - we're going to open up a new uh tab and
68:32 - doc uh in adam
68:35 - and we're gonna um open the project as
68:38 - foundation
68:40 - we're just gonna open up our
68:42 - foundation
68:44 - and then we're just gonna exit out of
68:46 - all of these tabs and we're gonna keep
68:49 - this untitled um tab right here we're
68:51 - gonna press uh control shift s
68:55 - and then we're gonna name this one port
68:57 - folio
68:59 - dot html
69:01 - we're gonna save that and then we're
69:03 - gonna make control n
69:05 - and then we're going to put ctrl shift s
69:07 - i'm going to name this one style.css
69:11 - this is going to be our new folders for
69:13 - this new website we're going to make
69:14 - we're going to keep the old folders just
69:16 - so we can refer back to other elements
69:18 - of foundation if we ever need to so what
69:21 - we're going to do first we're just going
69:22 - to type in some basic html
69:24 - just type in the words html it should
69:26 - shortcut to just this
69:28 - uh nice 10 lines of code it'll give you
69:30 - just the the head
69:32 - title body and closing and opening html
69:36 - tags we're going to give html
69:39 - a class called
69:42 - called no dash js we're going to add
69:46 - some more meta tags so we're just going
69:48 - to go
69:49 - meta oops
69:52 - meta tag then we're going to set um
69:56 - and we're going to set http
69:59 - equivalent set at the x equals ua and
70:02 - then dash com compatible and then we're
70:04 - going to set content ie equals
70:07 - edge
70:09 - save that and after that we're going to
70:11 - add another meta tag
70:12 - its name is going to be view
70:15 - port
70:18 - viewport like that now we're going to
70:20 - set content to
70:23 - width equals device
70:26 - width and we're going to add a comma
70:27 - we're going to set initial scale
70:30 - equal to 1.0 and that should be it for
70:34 - that meta tag and now we're going to
70:35 - give it a title we're going to call this
70:38 - portfolio
70:44 - save that and now we're going to link in
70:46 - our links so we're going to just put
70:48 - link tags going to keep style sheet and
70:50 - we're going to put in
70:53 - tss
70:56 - foundation
70:58 - dot css and after that we're gonna put
71:00 - another link and it's gonna be the same
71:01 - thing except for it's gonna be css slash
71:04 - app css that way it has css for mobile
71:06 - too after that we're gonna link our
71:08 - style sheet that's up here right now so
71:11 - we're just going to put in link
71:13 - and then it's going to be just style.css
71:17 - because we didn't put in any folders as
71:19 - you see here it's out right here in the
71:21 - open it's not in any folders so that
71:23 - should set up our head part now we're
71:25 - going to go into the actual code for the
71:27 - body so we're going to start off with a
71:29 - div i'm going to call it title
71:31 - bar and we're going to add another div
71:33 - we're going to give it a class of title
71:35 - bar left
71:37 - so title
71:39 - our
71:40 - left because we're gonna have a title
71:41 - bar on the left we're gonna add another
71:42 - div and the class is gonna be off
71:45 - canvas
71:46 - and then position
71:49 - left
71:51 - so we're gonna we're basically making a
71:53 - um
71:54 - a off canvas menu kind of thing so that
71:57 - when you're on mobile it can work for
71:58 - off canvas as well and then we're gonna
72:00 - add an id
72:02 - not an idea and i d be equal to off
72:06 - can this
72:08 - left
72:09 - and then we're going to add a data
72:11 - off
72:13 - canvas
72:14 - like that now inside of here we're going
72:16 - to add an unloaded list we're going to
72:18 - give this our list a class
72:21 - and it's going to be sub menu gonna be
72:23 - sub menu
72:25 - menu and then bird
72:28 - too cool
72:29 - so it's a vertical menu and then it's
72:30 - gonna have data
72:35 - data submenu now we're going to add list
72:37 - item and inside of these list items are
72:39 - going to be links
72:44 - so we're going to copy this now and
72:46 - we're going to paste it five times or
72:48 - four times and you should have five um
72:51 - link menus
72:53 - now you're just gonna put home
72:55 - skills
72:56 - projects
73:03 - about
73:04 - and then
73:05 - contact so we can navigate through them
73:08 - later we're just going to put home
73:11 - skills
73:15 - projects
73:19 - about
73:21 - and contact
73:24 - and this we're going to put ids in these
73:26 - sections down further into the website
73:28 - so we can navigate to them when we do
73:30 - get there but we're not there just yet
73:32 - so after this unordered list we're gonna
73:33 - put a div and inside of here we're gonna
73:35 - put a button
73:36 - and we can just take out the
73:38 - or we don't have to take out any of this
73:40 - we're gonna put data toggle and then
73:42 - it's gonna equal off
73:45 - canvas left and we don't need the div in
73:47 - this class right here so we can just
73:49 - take that out just to organize it and
73:51 - we're going to give this a class
73:53 - not cool
73:54 - class
73:55 - of menu dash icon and we don't need this
74:00 - type or actually no we don't need this
74:01 - name
74:04 - after that we're gonna put a span
74:06 - it's gonna have a class
74:09 - of title
74:11 - r
74:12 - title we're gonna put
74:14 - portfolio
74:16 - inside of there so inside of the body
74:18 - we're gonna um
74:20 - we're gonna put a div
74:22 - and we're gonna and inside of this div
74:24 - we're gonna give it an id
74:28 - of
74:29 - home and this is what i was talking
74:31 - about up here
74:32 - so when you click the home it's going to
74:33 - lead you down to this div and then we're
74:35 - going to give it a class
74:38 - of hero
74:40 - section
74:41 - and hero
74:42 - section is not in foundation so we're
74:45 - going to add our own personal css that's
74:47 - why we made the file earlier but we'll
74:49 - get to that in a second inside of here
74:51 - we're going to put another div and we're
74:53 - going to put the class as hero dash
74:56 - section dash text
74:59 - and then we're going to put
75:02 - each one and we're going to put your
75:04 - name or in this case my name then we're
75:06 - going to do an h5
75:08 - i'm going to do front and
75:11 - web developer now obviously you can add
75:14 - this to whatever you do uh this is just
75:16 - for the tutorial and so what we need to
75:18 - do now is we need to stylize this so
75:20 - you're gonna go up and click on your css
75:22 - file it's not there you can click this
75:24 - little arrow and click style that css
75:27 - and it'll bring you there
75:29 - um
75:29 - so what we're going to do first we're
75:31 - going to do a hero we're going to
75:33 - 0-section
75:35 - and go like that now before i start
75:37 - typing realize that it may seem like a
75:39 - lot of css but it's 10 times shorter if
75:42 - you were doing it without foundation so
75:45 - just have that in mind i'm going to do
75:47 - background
75:49 - and then url
75:50 - parentheses and i'm gonna copy and paste
75:53 - the image url i found earlier um the
75:55 - link will be in the description
75:57 - obviously we're gonna put parentheses
75:59 - and just paste it in
76:01 - and then at the very end we're gonna put
76:02 - fifty percent
76:04 - no repeat
76:06 - put a semicolon and press enter i'm
76:09 - going to do background
76:12 - size and then cover i'm going to do
76:14 - height
76:16 - 96 vh which is a vertical horizontal
76:20 - is what that means and then
76:23 - text line
76:24 - center and then we're going to do some
76:26 - web kits for the internet explorer users
76:29 - display
76:31 - i'm going to do dash web kit dash flex
76:36 - you're gonna do display
76:38 - and then ms-flex
76:41 - box
76:44 - and make sure you put a dash before that
76:46 - and then after this we're just gonna do
76:48 - normal
76:49 - display
76:50 - flex and then after that you can put
76:52 - webkit dash align
76:55 - dash items and you can just put
76:58 - center and then we're gonna tab and put
77:00 - ms dash flex dash align
77:04 - center
77:07 - and then we're just gonna do normal
77:10 - align items
77:12 - center
77:13 - make sure you put semicolons after all
77:15 - this and after this we're going to put
77:17 - we're going to go back from our
77:18 - indentation put webkit
77:22 - dash defy dash content
77:26 - and we'll just put center and then after
77:29 - that we're going to tap and put dash ms
77:31 - dash flex dash pack
77:34 - center
77:36 - and after that we're just going to do uh
77:37 - justify content center and what this
77:40 - code basically does all these web kits
77:41 - and stuff are basically so that other
77:44 - users can use them as well sometimes it
77:46 - doesn't work on all computers but the
77:48 - webkits make sure that it does work on
77:50 - computers that use internet explorer
77:53 - windows edge or microsoft edge even
77:56 - sometimes web browsers like that are a
77:58 - little bit more complicated
78:00 - so uh web kits tend to help with that
78:03 - and after this we're just going to put
78:05 - euro
78:08 - section
78:09 - and then we're just going to add the
78:10 - second class hero
78:11 - section
78:13 - text and this puts it in a hierarchy so
78:15 - that only text inside of the hero
78:18 - section will work
78:19 - and then we're just gonna add brackets
78:21 - and we're gonna have the color
78:22 - u f e f e
78:25 - we have text
78:27 - shadow one pixel one pixel two pixel and
78:31 - then we add color to it as zero a zero a
78:34 - zero a semicolon and this is all the css
78:37 - we're gonna need for right now so we can
78:39 - go back to our html now before we open
78:41 - it in the browser we need to come down
78:43 - here and add our javascript
78:46 - so we're gonna go in the body we're just
78:48 - gonna kind of indent so we're gonna make
78:50 - a script tag and we're just gonna take
78:52 - out this break right here
78:56 - we're gonna put it as js
78:59 - slash vendor
79:03 - slash
79:04 - jquery js and we're just gonna copy this
79:08 - paste it three more times
79:11 - should have four script tags just change
79:14 - this to what
79:16 - input change this to
79:19 - foundation
79:20 - dot js and this one to
79:25 - app.js
79:27 - and now it should work if we go ahead
79:29 - and check our browser you should get
79:31 - this looking right here now this is a
79:33 - pretty good home page you have our own
79:36 - custom-made heroes section
79:38 - um
79:39 - our little welcome and if you come up
79:42 - here to the navigation you get this side
79:44 - menu right here with all of the
79:46 - basically navigation of the website and
79:49 - if you click home not gonna bring this
79:51 - anywhere because this is already home
79:53 - so but that would work if we were to
79:55 - scroll down
79:56 - and have more parts of the website that
79:59 - would work
80:00 - after this we're gonna add another
80:02 - div we're going to give it
80:05 - an id
80:11 - of skills
80:13 - which we will use later for the
80:14 - navigation and we're going to give it a
80:16 - class of
80:18 - skills
80:21 - we're going to add an h2
80:24 - with the style of
80:27 - text
80:28 - line
80:29 - s
80:31 - then colon center semicolon inside of
80:34 - here we're going to put skills and after
80:37 - this we're going to add an h3 called
80:40 - html and after this we're going to add
80:42 - some progress bars and that's going to
80:44 - show how well we know the skill for this
80:47 - portfolio i'm going to add a div
80:49 - we're going to give this class a and
80:51 - it's going to have primary
80:54 - progress
80:56 - as its class and then roll is going to
80:59 - be progress
81:01 - bar
81:03 - tab index
81:05 - equals zero now we're going to set area
81:09 - value
81:11 - now equal to or we're gonna take out
81:13 - this dash and set it equal to
81:16 - zero actually we're gonna set it equal
81:17 - to 25
81:18 - and we're gonna copy this
81:25 - and we're gonna paste it instead of now
81:27 - we're gonna put
81:28 - min and we're gonna set it to
81:31 - zero we're gonna set we're gonna paste
81:33 - it again instead of now we're gonna put
81:36 - text we're gonna set it equal to 25
81:39 - percent
81:45 - we're gonna paste it again we're gonna
81:46 - set max
81:48 - as instead of now and we're gonna set it
81:50 - to
81:52 - a hundred and then we're gonna uh take
81:55 - this back
81:56 - and we're gonna press enter
81:59 - so there's room inside of this div
82:02 - i'm gonna add another div can it be
82:03 - called progress
82:05 - dash meter
82:06 - and then
82:07 - style
82:09 - we're going to set width
82:11 - to width to 90 percent and then
82:13 - paragraph tag
82:17 - set
82:18 - class equal to
82:19 - progress
82:21 - dash meter
82:23 - text
82:24 - and this should give us one of the
82:26 - progress bars if we check our browser we
82:28 - reload we scroll down we see we get this
82:30 - little uh progress bar down here and
82:32 - then we're gonna uh
82:34 - make a div up here after skills and call
82:37 - it skills
82:38 - dash enter
82:40 - and we're gonna copy
82:42 - uh the progress bar and everything with
82:44 - that
82:45 - inside of here and then we're gonna go
82:47 - into our css tab and uh stylize this
82:50 - skills thing so we're just gonna go
82:52 - skills
82:56 - um curly bracket and then we're gonna
82:58 - set
82:59 - height
83:00 - to 35 vh and then text align
83:05 - center
83:06 - and then background and set it we're
83:08 - going to set it to
83:11 - 4d5768 and then put a semicolon and then
83:14 - we're going to set the skills inner
83:16 - class
83:20 - to width of 50
83:23 - and then margin
83:24 - left 25
83:31 - and then
83:32 - padding bottom 5 pixels and what this
83:35 - basically does is it takes um the normal
83:39 - hero section it makes it smaller
83:41 - and then everything inside of it is
83:42 - going to be centered in the middle
83:44 - inside of a smaller box you go to your
83:46 - browser and reload you should see it
83:48 - like so that this is like all one
83:51 - section and then the the progress bars
83:53 - are in a smaller section inside of it
83:55 - that's what the skills inner
83:57 - class is for so now we can basically
84:00 - copy and paste everything from the h3
84:03 - html tags down to the end of the
84:06 - primary progress so we're just gonna
84:09 - copy this and paste it
84:11 - three times
84:13 - like that and i'm gonna change this to
84:16 - css3
84:18 - and this one to
84:20 - java
84:21 - script
84:22 - es6
84:25 - and then if you want you can change
84:27 - probably should change each of these so
84:29 - let's say each our css is only
84:32 - 85
84:34 - and we change the text down here so 85
84:36 - percent
84:37 - and then javascript let's say it's only
84:40 - 75 percent
84:42 - or just change these values down here if
84:45 - you go to your browser
84:47 - and you reload you should have three
84:48 - more progress bars with different values
84:51 - in them or the values you set to it
84:54 - so um
84:55 - here it shows that html is known ninety
84:58 - percent
84:59 - and i know it css three
85:02 - eighty five percent of the way and
85:03 - javascript es6 about 75 percent of the
85:06 - way now this is just hypothetical for
85:08 - this portfolio but you can change these
85:10 - values to whatever you'd like
85:13 - so after all these divs we're gonna put
85:15 - a div
85:16 - we're gonna give it a class of projects
85:19 - and then we're gonna
85:21 - give it an id of
85:28 - go down here and save that and inside of
85:30 - here we're going to give it a div and a
85:32 - class called project
85:34 - dash box and then we're going to do a
85:37 - a tag or an anchor tag inside of the
85:39 - anchor tag you're gonna do an image now
85:42 - i found this image offline if you want
85:44 - it it's down in the description along
85:46 - with everything else
85:47 - and
85:49 - so i just copied the uh image address
85:52 - and i pasted it and now we're going to
85:54 - add some alt text of port
85:58 - polio
86:00 - after that you're going to put
86:02 - an h2 tag and set the style
86:07 - to uh
86:08 - text dash align
86:12 - center and then
86:14 - we're just gonna put project as filler
86:16 - we're gonna do um
86:19 - we're just gonna do uh
86:22 - personal
86:23 - blog and then after this we're gonna
86:25 - copy
86:26 - this project box
86:28 - two more times
86:29 - we're gonna change the text from uh
86:32 - personal blog to
86:34 - java script
86:36 - bookmarker
86:38 - then we're just going to do um portfolio
86:43 - because i have a second portfolio and if
86:45 - we go ahead and check our browser so
86:47 - before we check the browser we're going
86:48 - to go to our style.css and we're going
86:50 - to make a projects
86:54 - and project
86:57 - project
86:59 - box
87:00 - and we're going to style these so for
87:02 - this one we're going to display
87:04 - flex
87:07 - make sure it's a semicolon and we're
87:09 - going to justify content into the center
87:12 - i'm going to do flex direction and we're
87:14 - going to do row and then
87:17 - flex wrap
87:19 - and then we're gonna do wrap that way if
87:22 - the browser gets smaller it will wrap
87:24 - and make it into a column instead of row
87:26 - and then we're just gonna set the height
87:28 - to 100
87:29 - percent and down in the project box
87:31 - we're going to do
87:32 - margin
87:34 - 15 pixels we're going to do with
87:38 - 250 pixels
87:40 - and height
87:42 - 250 pixels i'm going to order
87:46 - we're gonna do border
87:47 - radius 25 pixels and then background
87:51 - color
87:52 - is going to be black
87:55 - make sure you set this project box to
87:58 - image i forgot about that so the styling
88:00 - won't work correctly without the image
88:03 - um that's just uh targeting the image
88:05 - part of the box we're gonna go ahead and
88:07 - change uh javascript bookmarker because
88:09 - it's kind of a long title and we're just
88:11 - gonna put um
88:14 - js book marker and reload and you should
88:17 - have it looking like this
88:20 - now um you can obviously switch out the
88:21 - pictures i just you i just used the same
88:24 - one for all three just for convenience
88:26 - you should probably change each one of
88:28 - these to your own pictures
88:30 - of your actual uh project but for now
88:32 - this is good
88:34 - after this we're going to add a div
88:36 - and we're going to call it um
88:38 - we're going to give it a class of about
88:41 - and we're going to give it an id
88:44 - of about and then we're going to put a
88:46 - div inside of it call and give it a
88:47 - class of about
88:49 - box i'm going to put an h2 tag in here
88:52 - call it about and then a paragraph tag
88:54 - and then i'mma copy and paste my about
88:56 - from earlier so i'm gonna just paste
88:57 - that in here and then
88:59 - go back and now we're gonna go into the
89:01 - styling
89:02 - and we're gonna add
89:04 - a class of
89:06 - about
89:09 - and about
89:12 - box
89:13 - just set the height
89:15 - to 35 vh
89:17 - not 25 35 and then we're going to set
89:21 - text align
89:22 - center set background color
89:25 - for the background color we're just
89:27 - going to use the same color we did for
89:28 - skills
89:30 - we're just going to paste it down here
89:32 - in semicolon we're going to display flex
89:36 - we're going to align items and then into
89:39 - the center and then we're gonna go down
89:40 - to the about box we're gonna give it a
89:42 - background color we're gonna set it to
89:44 - five e
89:46 - four seven
89:48 - nine nine semicolon and then order
89:51 - radius 25 pixels and then height of 20
89:55 - vh makes you semicolon and then width
89:59 - is going to be 50 and then
90:02 - we're going to margin left
90:03 - about 25 pixels or a percent and just
90:06 - add a little bit of a padding bottom of
90:08 - five pixels
90:10 - change this four seven to
90:12 - seven four i messed up there it will
90:14 - give you purple if you type in four
90:16 - seven so make sure it's seven four you
90:17 - should get this blue color if you reload
90:19 - like this
90:21 - and it gives you a nice soft kind of
90:22 - grayish blue color that kind of looks
90:24 - nice on the eyes and also matches these
90:26 - pictures which i did not plan
90:28 - if you don't like the color scheme you
90:29 - can always change it there wasn't too
90:31 - much designing going into this um
90:33 - website it was mostly just to test every
90:36 - foundation function now one more thing
90:38 - we're just gonna um add another about
90:41 - box
90:42 - so about dash box
90:45 - comma
90:46 - paragraph tag and we're just going to
90:47 - set the padding on this for 5 pixels if
90:50 - you go back to your browser and you
90:51 - reload you see it just gives a nice
90:53 - padding to the
90:54 - the text of the so you can read it so
90:56 - after this we're going to give it
90:58 - another div we're going to add class to
91:01 - contact we're going to give it an id
91:04 - of contact it's just going to be an h2
91:08 - of contact
91:13 - i just put user at domain for the email
91:16 - this is gonna be
91:17 - email
91:19 - just because i'm not gonna put my actual
91:20 - email but you guys should put your
91:22 - actual email if you want your employer
91:24 - to contact you also you don't have to
91:26 - put uh email
91:28 - sometimes it might get confusing it
91:29 - might annoy the user and then we're just
91:31 - gonna put paragraph and we're gonna put
91:33 - a phone number so i'm just putting some
91:35 - random
91:36 - numbers
91:39 - so actually we're just gonna go one two
91:40 - three
91:41 - four five six
91:43 - seven eight nine
91:45 - euro
91:46 - like that i don't know if that's a real
91:48 - phone number i wouldn't find out and
91:50 - after this we're gonna go to our style
91:53 - and we're gonna add a class of contact
91:58 - i'm going to set a background color to
92:01 - uh hashtag
92:02 - 006 ea d
92:05 - and then we're going to set a height
92:07 - of 20 vh
92:10 - and then
92:12 - text align
92:13 - center
92:15 - and then after that if you check your
92:17 - browser and you reload you should have
92:19 - this little blue thing down here contact
92:21 - and then email and phone number and
92:23 - obviously style is that easier this is
92:25 - just like looking like kind of a call
92:27 - out kind of after your body and you're
92:29 - going to type in a footer tag now we're
92:31 - going to just make a quick little footer
92:34 - just for convenience and it's just going
92:35 - to say shadow
92:37 - tech
92:39 - i copied and pasted a copyright sign
92:41 - offline
92:42 - and you can just save that you're going
92:43 - to go back to your style and you're just
92:45 - going to add
92:47 - footer
92:49 - and then you're just going to do text
92:51 - align
92:52 - center
92:55 - and then just set a background color and
92:57 - for convenience just gray
93:00 - and after that if you check your website
93:02 - you should have a fully completed
93:04 - um
93:05 - simple portfolio that was made
93:08 - completely from scratch completely from
93:10 - foundation and it was only in about 80
93:12 - lines of css
93:14 - and around roughly 92 lines of html
93:18 - which is very small for a portfolio our
93:21 - html template was way more than that and
93:24 - this was this is a lot more than the
93:26 - template as well so you get more for
93:28 - less basically so more content for less
93:32 - lines of code for both uh portfolio and
93:34 - css so now that you've built your
93:36 - website in foundation there's a few more
93:39 - things that i think you guys should
93:40 - check out because they're kind of cool
93:42 - and it might be useful so if you go to
93:44 - foundation's website
93:46 - and you click getting started
93:48 - and then you click sites
93:50 - you see you get this little um
93:53 - page here
93:54 - and well this is where we found the html
93:57 - templates and there's some other things
93:59 - called building blocks
94:01 - now as it may seem you can literally
94:03 - click see code
94:05 - and add this to your um
94:08 - to your website and you can basically
94:10 - give ratings
94:13 - based off of you know like what you
94:16 - would be rating it on basically like you
94:19 - can copy this code click copy copy and
94:21 - copy and just paste each one in
94:24 - and you'd have to add your own
94:25 - javascript through a script tag inside
94:28 - of your uh website but that shouldn't be
94:30 - much of a problem and it basically gives
94:32 - you all the code
94:34 - for the um what it the building block is
94:37 - so in this case it's a star rating block
94:39 - and these are created by other people as
94:40 - you see this person
94:42 - made this but
94:44 - you can have your own profiles i guess
94:48 - but if you go back there's different
94:50 - things so you can go to navigation you
94:52 - can have these cool little uh
94:53 - navigations that people have made in
94:55 - foundation
94:57 - um
94:58 - status
95:04 - you can add status alerts and uh graphs
95:06 - and stuff
95:08 - um you can also do control
95:11 - and see social icons
95:13 - there's a lot of social buttons
95:16 - look at the social buttons
95:18 - easy so you can literally copy which
95:20 - parts you want so if i only wanted
95:22 - facebook twitter and youtube
95:25 - and instagram i would just copy these
95:27 - and then
95:28 - just copy all this because if you want
95:30 - to add more you can add more
95:32 - basically take out which links you want
95:34 - out and you can link in your own social
95:36 - media
95:37 - inside of these hashtags
95:43 - there's also mobile dashboards
95:46 - and instead of making our own hero we've
95:49 - could have we could have gone here
95:51 - and just clicked full screen hero
95:55 - and copy this code
95:57 - down here
95:59 - and could have done it that way
96:02 - but we decided to make it our own since
96:04 - we were creating our own website from
96:06 - scratch but if you do want to make
96:08 - another hero you can just come in here
96:10 - to the building blocks and find full
96:13 - screen hero
96:15 - and just edit it that way
96:19 - if you go back
96:23 - we go back all the way to where it says
96:25 - html templates you're gonna click uh
96:27 - resources and down here there's all
96:29 - sorts of add-ons for angular and for
96:32 - text editors and wordpress
96:34 - all this back-end stuff and this is
96:36 - where we would connect the back end with
96:38 - like our buttons and stuff
96:40 - where is it
96:42 - down here django
96:43 - your net.net and uh it looks like other
96:47 - backend stuff like flask for python
96:50 - php um
96:52 - ass foundation
96:54 - anyway up here you can see there's uh
96:56 - icon fonts
96:58 - which are just some like random stuff i
97:00 - guess you could put into your website
97:02 - svg icons
97:04 - oh so like social media icons
97:07 - and if you click getting started this is
97:08 - where we downloaded uh you can click
97:11 - kitchen sink and obviously go through
97:12 - kitchen sink
97:14 - you click home
97:15 - it gives you like a description of how
97:17 - foundation works so uh 50 code reduction
97:21 - so half the size of foundation five this
97:23 - is foundation six so they've upgraded it
97:26 - and if you keep scrolling through you
97:27 - can read all about their development
97:30 - and how foundation is apparently the
97:32 - best uh front-end framework that's
97:34 - responsive in the world is what they
97:36 - claim so throughout this entire course
97:38 - or crash course we've learned a lot and
97:40 - let's go over what we have learned so we
97:42 - went through all of kitchen sync which
97:44 - gave us every element of foundation all
97:47 - in one let's say document and we saved
97:51 - that website just as foundation after
97:53 - that we went on to html templates and we
97:56 - basically learned how foundation is
97:58 - structured using one of their templates
98:00 - and we edited the template so that it
98:02 - looks like our personal pro portfolio
98:04 - then after that we basically made our
98:06 - own portfolio from scratch
98:09 - and we made it so that we coded the
98:11 - entire thing we basically coded the
98:13 - entire portfolio from scratch not using
98:16 - any templates or anything just using
98:17 - foundation and it gave us a 50
98:20 - code reduction from the normal portfolio
98:22 - without foundation so basically um
98:25 - that's all for foundation i know this
98:27 - was a kind of a long crash course
98:30 - especially just for foundation but i
98:31 - made sure that you guys got all the
98:33 - content of foundation so don't forget to
98:35 - leave a like down below it helps a lot
98:38 - and comment down if you have any
98:39 - questions

Cleaned transcript:

hi guys welcome back to today i'm doing a crash course on foundation now foundation is a css responsive framework that makes every website available on mobile tablet and desktop devices my name is shadow and i'm going to be showing you guys today how to implement a css sponsor framework called foundation now for this tutorial i'm using specifically foundation version 6 made by zurb let's get straight into the crash course i'm gonna go to google or your browser and you're gonna type in foundation dot zerb.com it should bring you to this website if it doesn't look like this might have been outdated so we're gonna go ahead and click download we're gonna download the complete because it just gives us everything click download it should give you a zip file down here now you're gonna go to your desktop and you're going to click you're going to right click go to new folder you're going to name i'm going to name this foundation you can name it whatever you want back to your browser and go to your um your foundation download file click extract all click browse go to desktop click foundation click select folder and then click extract and what that does is basically takes all the files that we just downloaded and put it into our desktop file called foundation and we come down here and we read a little bit about it and how it works and it down here and it shows sites and emails you can also do foundation for emails but for this tutorial we're just going to do sites so we're going to want to do is you're going to go over to getting started then you're going to click sites kitchen sync and you should be in this giant long list called kitchen sink now kitchen sink is every element available in foundation all on one page as you see if you scroll down there's tons of tons of stuff you can put on to it we're going to go through all of it what you're going to want to do now is you're going to want to go down to your editor i'm using adam in this example and you're going to want to click open a project and we're going to select on foundation it should bring us okay so what we get is this large html file pretty long so what we're gonna want to do is we're going to want to delete everything out of the body tags keep the body tags delete everything inside of the body tags except for the javascript and you should be left with this okay so what we want to going to do next is we're going to build some simple form validation inside of foundation now we're gonna just start off with some form tags so we're gonna select that we're gonna write perform just like that we're gonna put some javascript data values in here so we're gonna put data dash abide and no validate we're gonna put a div inside of here we're gonna give it a class called grid x and grid dash margin dash x now inside of that dip we're gonna put another div and we're just gonna give it a class of cell we're gonna make another div we're gonna give it a class called alert blur all out we're gonna give it a style display none we're gonna go back and we're gonna add some javascript values data dash abide dash alert okay so next you're going to make another div and you're going to call it you're going to get a class of grid x and grid margin x and it's the same thing as this one up here it's just how foundation sorts out its uh their divs you're gonna put another div in here you're gonna give it a class called cell small dash 12. what you're going to do next is inside of this div you're going to put a label and you're going to put number number required now you're going to write an input tag and set the type to text or keep it as text and then put a placeholder of one two three four since we are validating numbers and we want the user to know what kind of input to put and then you're gonna put something called area dash describe describe i'm gonna set it equal and inside these are you're gonna put example help text make sure you capitalize the last two in camel case next you're going to put a required pattern so you're going to type in required and then you're going to put a space and then pattern and you're going to set it equal to number and then you can just take out this name and value it's not needed inside of there now next you're going to make a span and you're going to give it a class of form dash air and inside of this you can basically put whatever you want for when the user misspells something or something so you can say yo you've forgot something um like that so when there's an error message it'll just give you this this is basically the error message and after the span make sure you close out the label and after that label you can put paragraph tag and uh give it a class of help text so we're gonna put class help dash text save it and then you're gonna give it an id of example help text to make sure you camel case those and then next you're going to put whatever you want however you want to help the user so i'm gonna put here is how you fill it out and then just save it it's whatever help text you really want to put into it okay so next you're gonna wanna make a div you're going to give it the class the same one as the one up here you can just copy it and paste save it you're going to put a label and you're just gonna put password required and then after that you're gonna put an input and you're gonna put the type as pass word make sure the label is outside on the very end make sure you add an id and set it to password and you can set the placeholder to whatever you want as long as it looks like a password so like um like let's say if this was a password and we're gonna do the same thing we did up here with the area described by so we're just gonna copy this and paste it down here and then we're gonna write after it required and we could take out these name and values because we don't need them and after that we're going to put a span and add a class to it and in that class we're going to call it form air and then we're just going to put i'm required make sure your span and label end after that if you want you can indent them and after the span and label we're going to put a paragraph tag we're going to give it the class as help text and then we're going to give them the id as example help text camel cased inside of this we're going to put enter a password please now if you open it up in your browser the html file you see you get these two uh input fields in here now if you're the type in something other than numbers let's say abc and press enter it's going to say yo you forgot something and if you go to this password area and you just press enter it's going to say i'm required so it basically validates your form to make sure there's an input now these are just placeholders but other than the placeholders it's pretty much empty and you press enter and it says i'm required and if you put letters inside of the numbers it's gonna say you forgot something in your form so that's just some simple form validation for numbers and passwords you can always just change it as you see in the code it's pretty much a pattern up here and we can even add a comment right here um we just say uh about error message ballot right here and this is basically what validates it and then down here is the number valid date and then after that there is the password validate and basically what you can do is you can copy any of these and just change the classes and stuff you can always check the foundation website too it'll also tell you how to change it but these are just some simple form validation for uh foundation okay so up next is the accordion menu or just the accordion and so we're just gonna add a comment down here we're just gonna call it and i'm just gonna tab it down here so basically what we're gonna first do is put it in an unordered list and we're gonna put a class up here we're gonna call it accordion and then we're gonna put a data value called data core in inside of here we're going to put a list item tag and then we're going to give it class name called accordion item is active and then we're just going to give it a javascript value called data accordion item after that we're going to put a link so we're just going to type in a an anchor tag we're going to give it a class and we're going to give it the class called accordion title we're just gonna call this one accordion one and then after that we're gonna put a div we're gonna give this one a class called accordion dash content and then we're going to give it a javascript value called data dash tab dash content and then after this we're going to put a paragraph tag and we're gonna go give it a class next we're gonna put a paragraph tag and we're just gonna say hello world for this one and then we're just gonna put a link and we're just going to put link in it and it's just going to be an empty link now if we go to our website and reload we get this little panel right here but as you see there's only one so we're going to go back into our code and copy and paste it so we get more accordions so see we're back in here and we're going to copy and paste all of this actually we're only going to copy and paste what's inside of the list item we're just going to do it three times and then at the end you're just gonna put the closing tag for the unordered list and then if you go back to your code you see here you can minimize each tab so it's like an accordion and you can open them up by going like this it's pretty cool so we so we're gonna customize it a little bit more so instead of this being panel one we're gonna put panel two we're gonna take out this uh dummy text and we're gonna call this one panel two this one back to panel one this one panel three we're gonna take out all this dummy text and now if we go back to it we reload we get all of these where it's like this and we can customize it even more changing these i'm saving it and then we reload and you see you get it all organized with its content inside of it so accordion one panel one they're just empty links and you can open up each one and it gives you a new panel now up next are something called badges badges are an interesting kind of uh element inside of foundation so i'm just gonna show you what they are so let's just put a comment saying badges and we're gonna make a span tag we're gonna give it a class we're gonna call it primary badge and inside of that we're just gonna put the letter a as capitalized so we can view it and if you go over to your browser and you click reload you see down here down in the bottom left corner of your screen you should see the letter a and tying up inside of a little circle now we can copy this code make another version of it instead of primary we can do something called secondary secondary badge and then we can just put a b go back to the page and reload you get this you get this gray badge down here do now i've added a a div that has a margin bottom of 200 pixels just so you guys can view the badges easily now if we go down here and make another span or copy and paste it instead of primary or secondary we're going to do warning and then we're going to put this one with a c save it go to your web page and click reload and you'll get a yellow one with the letter c inside of it now if you go back to your code make another one there's also another class called alert and alert badge and success badge and if you reload you see you have all different colors of badges and the purpose of a badge is kind of like when something goes successfully or some sort of warning it shows up this badge next to like some words saying your form did not validate and it's has a red badge to it it can signify something about your form or about something you're trying to fill out these are also just great little decorations but if i zoom out to normal you can almost barely see them and i don't know why that is i don't think it's meant for reading i think i think it's meant just for the color and for signifying that something's not correctly filled out so up next we have buttons and we're just going to start off by putting a comment saying buttons or just button we're going to start off by obviously making a button and we're going to keep the type as button but we're going to take away the the name of the button because we don't need the name then we're going to give it a class called button now if you look at your uh website and you reload it you see down here you get an empty blue box that's because you have to put text inside of it so we're just gonna put button and if you go back and reload you see you have a button down here now i'm gonna add that padding back in here just so that we can get so you can see it clearly we reload as you see it's down here now you can give each button a type of class that changes the color or look of the button so for example if we copy this paste it and put a second or um success button and you reload it gives you a blue button if we were to paste it again and say alert button with a space and reload it you would get a red one you can also do the same for uh sizing so you can do tiny button and it gives you a tinier button or you could do a large button will give you even bigger button and you can even do things like expanded button so if we go to the class and put expanded button reload you see it takes up the whole width of the screen you can also have a small button too so it's in between the tiny and large button so if you just put small button and you reload you get this medium sized button and these are basically all the buttons obviously they're not linked to anything because we didn't uh put a hyper reference into here but you can link these two different things such as exists such as a success page or an error page take up the whole bottom of a portfolio object or you can just have different sizing buttons and colors they all have automatic hover and whenever it's like a green button or a black button it'll turn to white text or black text next we're going to do something called call outs now callouts are like little messages that show up on your screen they're not really messages they're more like sections so i'ma show you what they are and how they're useful now we're gonna um just put a comment like always and we're gonna just call this call out and then just indent it here and then we're gonna make a div and we're gonna have the class as call out we're gonna put an h5 and we're just gonna say hello world and then we're gonna put a paragraph tag we're just gonna say this is a call out we're gonna save it and you know just for fun we're gonna put a link we're just gonna say link now if we go to our browser you see down here we have a call out it's just a simple little section that we have that says hello world this is a call out and a link which does nothing and but what we can do with it is we can change it so let's copy this and we're going to set um actually just copy the the callout part not the um the margin we're gonna do call out warning and it gives us this yellow call out now we can do this for success and alert too so if we do call out success and call out alert and we reload you get the green one and the red one which are just basically um like like the buttons and the badges success and um warning now there's also a secondary one that shows the gray if we um but call out suck on dairy we save it we reload you get this grayish kind of one now another thing too about this is there's also a primary one where you can set it back to its default called calm call out primary and if you save and you reload you get back to this blue one there's the difference between just call out and call out primary and secondary obviously alert warning and success are completely different but you always have to watch out for these um these class changes so in foundation there's things called close boxes or just closeouts what you can basically do with them is you can add them to callouts for example and you can be able to close out of a call out and wipe it from your screen and i'm going to show you how to do that so what you're going to want to do is you're going to want to add a data value after your class called data dash close level then after that you're going to want to add a button so just type in a button and you can keep the type as button and you can take out the name you're going to add a data value to this called data close we're going to add an area label before the data close so area dash label i'm going to set that equal to you're gonna write close alert and you're gonna give it a class called close button and save the file after this you're going to make a span inside of the first span tag you need to put area dash hidden and you can set it equal to true colon and then save the file now you're going to want to put this span you're going to copy it and then you're going to put it inside of the closed i mean you're going to put it inside of the button and then you're going to save now if you go to your website now if you check your web browser you should see this little x over here and when you click it it just disappears now when you reload the page it obviously comes back because it's not saved into your local data or caches but there's a way you can do that but you can basically exit out of any call out you want just by adding those data variables and the classes now make sure you do wrap the variables into the div so make sure there's one large div around the whole thing like in here i added a div so it would close off the call out make sure you put a div so you close out the call out and the close button and the span and yeah basically that's how you add an exit out button or a a closeout tab on any call out okay so up next we're going to do a drop down pane now drop down pane is basically where you click the button and it shows a little message below it these can be used for many things such as errors with badges or panels you can use this as a little help text so we're gonna i'm gonna show you how to do this so first we're gonna scroll down after all the call outs we're gonna make a comment or tab it in and we're gonna call it drop down pane and save it and then first we're going to put a button we're going to leave the type alone we're just going to take out the name so we don't need it we're going to give it a class called button so class button this just gives primary button standards we're gonna put data dash toggle and set it equal to we're gonna name it to example dash drop down and now inside of this button we're just gonna put um drop actually we're just gonna say toggle drop down and after this button we're going to make a div it's going to have the class drop down dash pane we're going to give it the id of example dash drop down and then we're going to give it data dash drop down and then we're just going to call this one drop down pain and if we go to our website this should be working and down in the bottom right you should see this little button saying toggle drop down if you click it and scroll down you get this little text bubble saying drop down pane now if we center this it works a little easier and if we add padding so we're going to do that just to show for a full example now we're going to give this um now we're going to put this in inside of the larger div so we're going to put div we're going to copy all of this inside of here and we're going to just um we're not going to give this a class we're just going to do inline styling we're going to do um display flex and then we're going to do just if i dash content center and text dash align center and we're just going to add margin 15 pixels if we save this this should give it a nice look to it so as you see it has pretty good but we're going to add some more margin to it so that it centers more up we're just going to say 25 and if you reload it looks nicer now if you click it you get this little text below it saying drop down pane now if we want to see the full example we're going to add about 50 and then we're just going to do from margin we're going to do margin bottom that way we get what we want we reload we click it says drop down pane and we've clicked the button again it goes away just like a help text or an error so up next is floating classes and we're going to be floating buttons to left or right so first we're going to add a comment and we're going to just say flow buttons we're going to put floating buttons and then just indent it a little and then what you're going to do first is just put you're going to put button you're going to take out the type and you're gonna actually you can keep the type you're gonna take out the name you're gonna add class as just button then you're gonna put a space and then float dash left and then you're gonna put inside of the button just some text saying float left and if you go to your browser you should have a button floating to the left now as you see down here you have a button floating to the left also you don't always have to use just the normal um primary button you can always go like you can always go uh success button and make it a green button or even a an alert button so alert button left and then you can just copy this and let's say we want this to be a success button and we're just going to make it float to the right we're just going to change the text saying right we go back to our tab reload you have a green button floating on the right and a red button floating on the left and those are basically the floating classes for buttons so up next are labels and labels are basically almost like the badges but you can actually put a word inside of them and be able to read the word so i'm gonna show you what that is so we're gonna make a comment and we're just gonna put labels and then indent so what you're going to first want to do is you're going to put a span you're going to give it a class called primary label and then inside of that you're going to put primary label and then you save it if you go to your browser as you see at the bottom you see this little blue thing called primary label now if we go back and we copy it and you can put things like success and just keep pasting it you can do um you copy it and you can paste it you can put um warning you could put alert and you can even do um secondary if you save it and go view it in your browser you see in the bottom left you have all these labels right here and they're not buttons so you can't really click on them and expect to go somewhere the more like the badges where they're just there to show you like a message of some sort but like a very small message such as success or virus or hello so they're they're kind of useful but sometimes they're not so up next we're doing off campuses now off campuses are those things you kind of see when you're on mobile devices so for example you're trying to look at the menu but you're on your phone you usually have it off canvas appear and it's the three little lines that you click on opens up a side canvas or an off canvas and also referred to as off menus or side menus we're going to learn how to make one of those in foundation first you're going to start off with div tags obviously you're going to give it a class called off dash canvas dash wrapper and you're going to give it another div and the class is going to be off canvas enter off canvas wrapper dash inner you're going to save that i'm going to give it the data type data off wrapper after this you're going to put another div and you're going to give this one a class name of off dash can s position dash left you're going to add an id called off canvas left and then you're going to add data off dash off dash and this and then after all that we're going to leave those divs empty for now after that they're going to add a button you're going to take out the name like we usually do i'm gonna give it a class we're just gonna put it as the button class or the primary button we're gonna add data toggle we're going to set it equal to off can this left and then we're just going to put in here open or we're just going to put uh off canvas forgot to add the comment so we're just gonna add that really quick or just say off cam this save it now if you go to your browser you should see this button down here and when you click it it gives you this off canvas kind of look but it has no content inside of that so we're going to add that really quick so over here in these inner divs all the way into the middle we're just going to put an h2 tag and we're just say hello world and then we're just gonna put an h4 just saying docs or we're just put html and then another h4 saying css um just another one called java script and save that reload and we click off canvas and gives us this little side menu we could bank we can make these links too just by adding opening and closing tags to the very ends copying and pasting them adding placeholders as hashtags save it and you reload and now they're links and you click on them and it just brings you back to the top of the page open it and this is just these are just links and this is an off campus menu but when you minimize it if we inspect and we go to mobile let's just go to a google pixel 2. when we click off canvas it looks like one of those menus that you would have for a phone so and this works on any phone we can go all the way down to an uh an iphone 5se and it still works which are usually the smaller phones so it's good to know that these still work on all devices so up next is pagnation now pagnation is like a type of navigation that hangs out at the bottom and you can go through multiple pages usually at the bottom of product pages or blog pages you can go through multiple pages without having to navigate through the top navigation bar i'm going to show you how to do that down here we're just going to make a another comment as usual just so we can divide up our code we're just going to say pagnation bar indented a little and then we're gonna start off with an unordered list give it a class of tag and nation we're gonna give it a roll and set it equal to navigation and then we're gonna put area and then set it equal to pagination with the capital p inside of this we're going to put in list item we're going to give it a class called disable inside of this we're going to put previous and inside of this uh list item we're going to put a span tag we're gonna give it a class called show dash four dash sr and then we're just gonna put page in between this span tag and we could just close off the ends like that and then after this you're gonna you're gonna copy this and paste it below you're gonna change the class name to current actually you're not gonna put any you're not gonna put anything between those so you're gonna take out the previous you're gonna just put you are on or on page and then in between the span and the list item you're just gonna put one after that you're gonna put another list item list item you're just gonna put a list item a link inside of this you're going to set it to just the hashtag as the placeholder you put area label and set it equal to page two in between you're gonna just put a two between the anchor tag and then you're just gonna copy and paste this and you're just gonna change the numbers from two to three to four and you can just take out this last one we only need to go to four you can change this to three four so next you're gonna add a list item you're gonna give it a class of ellipse and you're gonna do it area hidden equal you're gonna just do true and you're just gonna leave this as that and you're gonna copy just two of these and then you just put in for now we'll just put uh pages 12 and 13. we're going to change this for that after that you're going to copy this this item right here you're going to paste it you're going to set the area labeled to capital next space page make sure the page is not capitalized and then after that instead of 13 you're just gonna put next and then you're gonna copy this uh span right here you're gonna paste it after next instead of uh putting you are on page you're just gonna put page if you reload your web page you should get this down here that looks like a little navigation that you would have for a website as you see the disabled class works perfectly with previous and then you can go on to next pages and stuff except for we only have one page so it's not going to go anywhere but uh we're going to style it stylize this a little bit more so you go to your um unordered list we're going to add a style tag we're going to say display flex and then we're gonna put justify content and then we're gonna set it to center and if we go back to our web browser we reload it it should be in the middle just like most web pages would look like now flexbox does work pretty well with uh foundation i haven't found any errors with it as you can see i easily centered that div or that um unordered list into the middle with no problem so foundation does work pretty well with uh flexbox and this is uh what a pagnation looks like on a web browser and that's how you make it in foundation so up next is progress bars now um just a disclaimer in my opinion bulma's uh progress bars are much better than foundations but we're still gonna learn them anyway just to see the difference between the two so let's just go ahead and make them um you're gonna go down here just make a comment uh progress and then down here you're gonna make a div you're gonna give it a class of primary progress save that and you're going to go inside so inside of this div you're going to make another dip and you're going to put the class name at progress meter and then style with 25 inside of this you're going to put paragraph tag you're going to put 25 percent you're gonna give this paragraph tag a class it's gonna be progress dash meter dash text and this is gonna be all there is to your progress bar now if you check your browser now if you check your browser you see you have this progress bar in here and you can customize it even more with the warning and success labels as here all we have to do is copy it and we just put a warning progress when we reload it we have a yellow one we do this the same for alert and we could do this the same for success and if we reload you have all these different colors there is not a secondary one because the background's already gray so it'd be kind of useless you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the progress so they just decided not to have a secondary one now the ways you change the the progress on the bars is you go up to this width styling and you just change it to whatever percent you want and then down here in the paragraph you want to change it to match that so this primary progress should now be at 50 change any of these so we change this to 65 change this one to 3 percent and yeah basically if we reload you have all different types of widths and stuff and different colors for different types of labeling and yeah that's basically it for progress bars so um next are switches now switches are kind of pointless without a back end but i'm still going to show you the front end and how they're used in foundation so first we're going to make a comment right as always my foundation uh switch and then we're gonna save that we're gonna make a div we're gonna give this a class called tiny switch we're gonna put an input we're gonna give this a class of switch dash input and save it we're gonna give it an id of tiny switch and then we're going to change the type from text to check box and we're going to change the name to example switch and we can take out the value as well now after that we're gonna put a label we're gonna add a class to it and this one's gonna be called switch dash paddle let's save that and then we're gonna put four small switch we're gonna put a span inside of the label we're gonna give it a class it's gonna be show dash four dash sr and inside of this we're going to put small porsche only we're going to capitalize each of these and this should basically give you a switch now if you go ahead and check your browser so in your browser you're going to see this little switch down here and it this is all it does kind of uh misleading but it still looks cool to play with click it a million times if you'd like with some back end i guess it'd be kind of cool you can fill it out as a form so like yes no yes no now you can also add different classes so that you can make them bigger or smaller so we're basically going to copy this we're going to paste it down here we're going to change every tiny too small so we're just going to go ahead and take every tiny we're going to go small and then save it and if you reload you have another one that's slightly bigger than the first one and we do the same thing and make it bigger we're just going to copy this and we're going to find everywhere where it says small and the way i'm doing this is i'm holding ctrl while i'm clicking and you're just going to backspace and put large and you're going to save that you're going to reload and you're going to have a very large button or switch and this is basically how switches work in foundation up next we're going to make tables now tables look a little different in uh foundation and i'll you'll see why in a minute but uh we're just gonna go ahead and start making that now so obviously you know the drill we're just gonna make some comment so we can keep organized and then and then you're gonna put a table tag just like that and then t head or table head and then we're going to make a table row now we're going to make a table header we're going to give it a width of 200. we're just going to name this table header and then we're going to do another table header we're just gonna add no width to this and just say table header now we're gonna copy and paste this one twice we're gonna change this one to 150 we're going to change this one the 150 as well now after the table head we're going to make a table body and then we're going to make a table row and then table data and inside of this data we're gonna put just some text some filler text so we're just gonna say content goes here and next one we're just gonna do table data lorem ispium and we're just gonna minimize this down a little bit so it's not too long and then we can just copy this one and paste it twice over there and after that we're gonna copy this and paste it three more times or two more times as you see we have a perfectly made table over here you see the first row goes gray or a light gray the second one goes full white and then it's a pattern after that and basically what we did is we made one with a certain amount of width and basically organizes it like in a css grid so that it goes one large and then two small ones and this is basically how a table works in foundation so up next is the title bar now the title bar is very responsive navigation usually used on mobile and web apps or mobile websites when you're designing for mobile first they usually have the little cutout on the side where the breadcrumbs that you can easily navigate through and they're very responsive so i'm gonna show you how to make one in foundation so just going to make comment title bar like that indent and then you're going to give it a class called title dash bar inside of there you're gonna make another div and it's gonna be called title dash r gosh left because we're gonna make it to the left we're gonna put a button we're gonna leave the type as button but we can take out the name we're gonna give it a class we're gonna call this menu icon we're gonna put a span after this this is going to have a class called title dash bar left inside of here we're just going to put foundation and then after that div inside of the title bar div but not inside of the title bar left we're gonna make another div we're gonna call this one title dash bar dash right we're gonna put a button we're gonna take out the name we're gonna put a class in here we called menu i put a dash in between and this should give you your little title bar and if you check your browser should have this little title bar now you want to uh obviously put at the top of your web page so it looks like a title now i added some margins so it looks like it's at the top of the page it's really not it's just uh it's just some margin but it looks like it's at the top of a page and this is basically what it looks like the pages don't do anything but you can actually connect the off canvas to those um those to the menu icons and they can open up side menus especially if you're on mobile that can be useful and this is all responsive if i were to go like this it's all responsive there's not much to respond about but it it's still responsive if you have actual navigations inside of this black bar right here it becomes responsive and yeah that's basically how you make a navigation slash title bar in foundation so up next is a tool tip and a tool tip is like um you'll see them in wikipedia a lot and it kind of gives you a general definition of a word that the user might not quite understand right away so i'm gonna show you how to do that now we're just gonna make a comment we're gonna call this tool tip and we're gonna make a paragraph tag because it is a sentence and we're just gonna put the and we're going to space it but we're going to take out that space now inside of this paragraph tag we're going to put a span now the span is going to have a data type called data dash tool tip and then it's going to have area that has pop up we're going to set that equal to true we're going to set a class to has dash tip now we're going to say data dash disable dash hover we're going to set that equal to false and then we're going to put tab index and we're going to set tab index equal to 1 and then we're going to put title fantasy word for a beetle and then this is just another word for a beetle i just copied and pasted it and then this is just some filler text i found well we're just going to do laura mistbium we're going to save that and if you go into your browser and you reload you see down here you get the sentence and oops make sure you put a space after the title not a space uh after the uh the definition word and if you reload you get this and when you hover over it says fancy word for a beetle and it's just a basic definition of what it is you'll see these a lot on wikipedia you can add these to your docs on your website or whatever and that's how it works in foundation so up next is something called html templates and foundation foundation has their own set of templates they have a total of eight if you go to foundation.zurb.com templates.html you'll find these html templates now there's a total of eight and you can download any of them or you can just watch the demo they have news magazines real estate ecommerce blogs portfolios and product pages and a few more these are very helpful if you're just trying to create a portfolio for your business or for getting a job and you don't have too much experience and you just need something to get out there with today we're just going to do the portfolio so you're going to click see demo and as you see this is what the portfolio looks like or the template and if we right click and click view page source there's all this code right here we're going to click control a control c so basically what we're going to do is we're going to click control a and control v and you're going to save it now the first thing you're going to notice is everything is in one straight line and nothing is organized like we are organizing it earlier and that's okay you just need an atom package or a package to go along with your code there's gonna be a link in the description it's an atom package called atom beautify and this organizes your code just like we were doing with all the indentations and white space now uh you can install this package just by clicking install and open with atom and it should install like that if not you can uh install using npm um or the apm command line and just install it that way but it's so much easier if you just clicked install here but once you've installed this you should be able to go to your code and click packages adam beautify and then click beautify what this does is it organizes all the code automatically with all of its indentations and stuff now if you go to your file folder and you click your text or your document you should find this as your document not the link anymore and here's where we will reload and edit our website so we can just minimize out of this minimize out of that and the first things we can change is the title we're going to change this to portfolio so portfolio save we can leave all these links alone we can leave all these script tags alone as you see it it just does its own functionality and you see off canvas position left reveal for large this is what the off campus looks like in this website but there's not a button to open it so it's just always open so we're going to edit this uh off canvas first the height is a hundred percent then down here we're just going to change this to liam stockton save that and then this is a little bio it looks like right yeah it's a little bio so i'm gonna copy and paste the bio from my portfolio so this is my portfolio and we're just gonna go to about and i'm gonna just copy this and then i don't need that anymore then we're gonna go down here i'm gonna paste it into this paragraph tag and then if we save it reload i have my own about down here now you can obviously write your own and you probably should and just change the span below to you know stockton save that then down here there's a call out call out primary what this call out is is this thing up here and they set the width so that it takes up the entire um heading basically and so we're going to change this we're going to just change this to x and expand your creativity and it's just going to have some words down here we're just going to change this text to something whatever you really want it's going to come up here so you just can kind of choose what you want to say up here i'm going to just write some stuff so i wrote this just a little phrase right here and if we go ahead and reload you see we get this over here and now we need to move on to the pictures so i pulled an image from my um my personal images and i'ma just paste it into here and we're gonna rename this to me and it's a jpeg file so down in or we're gonna go back up to the image instead of this right here we're just going to do me dot jpg if we reload there's a picture of me up here now now if um as far as these projects go we need to find images for them so over here are basically projects now of course you're not going to have like 12 projects as it's shown here but uh you're going to at least have at least three or four good ones so we're going to take out some of these so if we go down here we're gonna look for it there's all these cells so we can take out the first one two three four five six we'll just take out the first six and save it and we could take out two more because it kind of looks weird actually no we're just gonna uh copy and paste these two paste them back because we need them if we reload you should have only eight and what we're gonna do is we're gonna fill in these projects so we're just gonna put um uh we're just gonna put port folio as a project and then we're gonna make it a link the portfolio is one project we're going to make this one javascript book marker that's another project and we just replace this pasting and we're going to put this one as let's just say personal website or we're going to do a personal blog and we're gonna save that as a website and these are just different projects that i'm filling in as obviously you can come up with your own projects these are just things that i've done javascript um javascript calculator and we're just going to put one here we're just going to put python e logger we need three more word press plug ends actually we need to make this a link so we're gonna do word press plugins down here we're just gonna put uh react js projects and down here we're just going to do u dot js projects if we reload you see we have oops this one is not a link make sure you make them all links because you want to link to your uh project obviously so we're just going to do this reload and you see they're all links they don't go anywhere you can put your own links so i'm gonna just link these so i've linked some of my uh personal projects in here so if we click portfolio you get to my portfolio click javascript bookmarker you get to all my projects now what we need to do is add pictures or thumbnails so that they want to click on them so this is where we go to google images we need to search for port folio we need it um so we're just search for portfolio and then in tools we're gonna click size and then exactly 550 by 550 because that's what's over in here and it even tells you the pixel size so i found this image it's not really an image of a portfolio but it's going to work for now since it's just a stock image so we're going to right click and click um copy image address and then we're gonna put it in for each of these placehold dot it pictures you're just gonna paste it in and you can even do the control version and just paste it in like that you do it however you want it's just how you paste it in and replace the the thumbnail pictures with this link that we have if we go over and we reload you see we have a bunch of phones and this doesn't look very nice so we're gonna um add some variety to it so we're just gonna keep finding random images and we're just gonna keep copying the image address and replacing them with different uh thumbnails all images will be in the link in the description i'm just finding random images and clicking copy image address and just pasting them in that way it doesn't all look the same we can get some variety to our portfolio as you see if i reload okay so once you're done copying all these images and finding them you should have a variety like this now um if you want to find these images you can find them in the description i found most of them from just google images so it's not that hard to find but do remember that you have to cite and credit each of these authors they're not you can't just take these images you can always put it down in your footer somewhere but uh just make sure you credit these uh people who took the pictures or made the pictures just so you don't get copyrighted claimed or even sued okay so after this you're going to look at this contact me and you're going to want to change uh the text obviously because it's just dummy text we're going to go ahead and change the text so it says contact me and we're going to change out this text so we're just going to say contact me through my social media or through the form um i will try i will respond within 72 hours or we're just going to say uh 24 hours so i just put some text contact me through social media or through the forum i'll try my best to respond within 24 hours and now we now we just need to check this so um change this social media so but uh we're not gonna use dribble we're just gonna do youtube instagram and we're gonna do twitter i'm gonna just paste in these links and instagram save that and we go back and we reload you see we have each of these and if you click on them they lead to your social media in this case my youtube channel this form does not work um obviously you need to set up some back end there is a way you can plug in mailchimp into foundations um into foundations uh back in but and for this tutorial we're just doing front end so we're not going to do that but we're going to go ahead and look at the form and you can change the uh placeholder so it says um type here or we can just say message here and if we go back and reload instead of ola designer it's going to say message here now we have a simple portfolio made in foundation right here and it looks pretty good it's pretty good for a starter portfolio even if you don't have much experience with foundation or with any of these you still can make a pretty good portfolio using an html template and foundation you're probably wondering great i can build a website with a template i know all the factors of foundation and all of its responsiveness but how do i build a website from scratch and that's exactly what we're gonna do right now so right now we're going to build a website from scratch so completely no templates no um no copying pasting all just pure code so we're going to open up a new uh tab and doc uh in adam and we're gonna um open the project as foundation we're just gonna open up our foundation and then we're just gonna exit out of all of these tabs and we're gonna keep this untitled um tab right here we're gonna press uh control shift s and then we're gonna name this one port folio dot html we're gonna save that and then we're gonna make control n and then we're going to put ctrl shift s i'm going to name this one style.css this is going to be our new folders for this new website we're going to make we're going to keep the old folders just so we can refer back to other elements of foundation if we ever need to so what we're going to do first we're just going to type in some basic html just type in the words html it should shortcut to just this uh nice 10 lines of code it'll give you just the the head title body and closing and opening html tags we're going to give html a class called called no dash js we're going to add some more meta tags so we're just going to go meta oops meta tag then we're going to set um and we're going to set http equivalent set at the x equals ua and then dash com compatible and then we're going to set content ie equals edge save that and after that we're going to add another meta tag its name is going to be view port viewport like that now we're going to set content to width equals device width and we're going to add a comma we're going to set initial scale equal to 1.0 and that should be it for that meta tag and now we're going to give it a title we're going to call this portfolio save that and now we're going to link in our links so we're going to just put link tags going to keep style sheet and we're going to put in tss foundation dot css and after that we're gonna put another link and it's gonna be the same thing except for it's gonna be css slash app css that way it has css for mobile too after that we're gonna link our style sheet that's up here right now so we're just going to put in link and then it's going to be just style.css because we didn't put in any folders as you see here it's out right here in the open it's not in any folders so that should set up our head part now we're going to go into the actual code for the body so we're going to start off with a div i'm going to call it title bar and we're going to add another div we're going to give it a class of title bar left so title our left because we're gonna have a title bar on the left we're gonna add another div and the class is gonna be off canvas and then position left so we're gonna we're basically making a um a off canvas menu kind of thing so that when you're on mobile it can work for off canvas as well and then we're gonna add an id not an idea and i d be equal to off can this left and then we're going to add a data off canvas like that now inside of here we're going to add an unloaded list we're going to give this our list a class and it's going to be sub menu gonna be sub menu menu and then bird too cool so it's a vertical menu and then it's gonna have data data submenu now we're going to add list item and inside of these list items are going to be links so we're going to copy this now and we're going to paste it five times or four times and you should have five um link menus now you're just gonna put home skills projects about and then contact so we can navigate through them later we're just going to put home skills projects about and contact and this we're going to put ids in these sections down further into the website so we can navigate to them when we do get there but we're not there just yet so after this unordered list we're gonna put a div and inside of here we're gonna put a button and we can just take out the or we don't have to take out any of this we're gonna put data toggle and then it's gonna equal off canvas left and we don't need the div in this class right here so we can just take that out just to organize it and we're going to give this a class not cool class of menu dash icon and we don't need this type or actually no we don't need this name after that we're gonna put a span it's gonna have a class of title r title we're gonna put portfolio inside of there so inside of the body we're gonna um we're gonna put a div and we're gonna and inside of this div we're gonna give it an id of home and this is what i was talking about up here so when you click the home it's going to lead you down to this div and then we're going to give it a class of hero section and hero section is not in foundation so we're going to add our own personal css that's why we made the file earlier but we'll get to that in a second inside of here we're going to put another div and we're going to put the class as hero dash section dash text and then we're going to put each one and we're going to put your name or in this case my name then we're going to do an h5 i'm going to do front and web developer now obviously you can add this to whatever you do uh this is just for the tutorial and so what we need to do now is we need to stylize this so you're gonna go up and click on your css file it's not there you can click this little arrow and click style that css and it'll bring you there um so what we're going to do first we're going to do a hero we're going to 0section and go like that now before i start typing realize that it may seem like a lot of css but it's 10 times shorter if you were doing it without foundation so just have that in mind i'm going to do background and then url parentheses and i'm gonna copy and paste the image url i found earlier um the link will be in the description obviously we're gonna put parentheses and just paste it in and then at the very end we're gonna put fifty percent no repeat put a semicolon and press enter i'm going to do background size and then cover i'm going to do height 96 vh which is a vertical horizontal is what that means and then text line center and then we're going to do some web kits for the internet explorer users display i'm going to do dash web kit dash flex you're gonna do display and then msflex box and make sure you put a dash before that and then after this we're just gonna do normal display flex and then after that you can put webkit dash align dash items and you can just put center and then we're gonna tab and put ms dash flex dash align center and then we're just gonna do normal align items center make sure you put semicolons after all this and after this we're going to put we're going to go back from our indentation put webkit dash defy dash content and we'll just put center and then after that we're going to tap and put dash ms dash flex dash pack center and after that we're just going to do uh justify content center and what this code basically does all these web kits and stuff are basically so that other users can use them as well sometimes it doesn't work on all computers but the webkits make sure that it does work on computers that use internet explorer windows edge or microsoft edge even sometimes web browsers like that are a little bit more complicated so uh web kits tend to help with that and after this we're just going to put euro section and then we're just going to add the second class hero section text and this puts it in a hierarchy so that only text inside of the hero section will work and then we're just gonna add brackets and we're gonna have the color u f e f e we have text shadow one pixel one pixel two pixel and then we add color to it as zero a zero a zero a semicolon and this is all the css we're gonna need for right now so we can go back to our html now before we open it in the browser we need to come down here and add our javascript so we're gonna go in the body we're just gonna kind of indent so we're gonna make a script tag and we're just gonna take out this break right here we're gonna put it as js slash vendor slash jquery js and we're just gonna copy this paste it three more times should have four script tags just change this to what input change this to foundation dot js and this one to app.js and now it should work if we go ahead and check our browser you should get this looking right here now this is a pretty good home page you have our own custommade heroes section um our little welcome and if you come up here to the navigation you get this side menu right here with all of the basically navigation of the website and if you click home not gonna bring this anywhere because this is already home so but that would work if we were to scroll down and have more parts of the website that would work after this we're gonna add another div we're going to give it an id of skills which we will use later for the navigation and we're going to give it a class of skills we're going to add an h2 with the style of text line s then colon center semicolon inside of here we're going to put skills and after this we're going to add an h3 called html and after this we're going to add some progress bars and that's going to show how well we know the skill for this portfolio i'm going to add a div we're going to give this class a and it's going to have primary progress as its class and then roll is going to be progress bar tab index equals zero now we're going to set area value now equal to or we're gonna take out this dash and set it equal to zero actually we're gonna set it equal to 25 and we're gonna copy this and we're gonna paste it instead of now we're gonna put min and we're gonna set it to zero we're gonna set we're gonna paste it again instead of now we're gonna put text we're gonna set it equal to 25 percent we're gonna paste it again we're gonna set max as instead of now and we're gonna set it to a hundred and then we're gonna uh take this back and we're gonna press enter so there's room inside of this div i'm gonna add another div can it be called progress dash meter and then style we're going to set width to width to 90 percent and then paragraph tag set class equal to progress dash meter text and this should give us one of the progress bars if we check our browser we reload we scroll down we see we get this little uh progress bar down here and then we're gonna uh make a div up here after skills and call it skills dash enter and we're gonna copy uh the progress bar and everything with that inside of here and then we're gonna go into our css tab and uh stylize this skills thing so we're just gonna go skills um curly bracket and then we're gonna set height to 35 vh and then text align center and then background and set it we're going to set it to 4d5768 and then put a semicolon and then we're going to set the skills inner class to width of 50 and then margin left 25 and then padding bottom 5 pixels and what this basically does is it takes um the normal hero section it makes it smaller and then everything inside of it is going to be centered in the middle inside of a smaller box you go to your browser and reload you should see it like so that this is like all one section and then the the progress bars are in a smaller section inside of it that's what the skills inner class is for so now we can basically copy and paste everything from the h3 html tags down to the end of the primary progress so we're just gonna copy this and paste it three times like that and i'm gonna change this to css3 and this one to java script es6 and then if you want you can change probably should change each of these so let's say each our css is only 85 and we change the text down here so 85 percent and then javascript let's say it's only 75 percent or just change these values down here if you go to your browser and you reload you should have three more progress bars with different values in them or the values you set to it so um here it shows that html is known ninety percent and i know it css three eighty five percent of the way and javascript es6 about 75 percent of the way now this is just hypothetical for this portfolio but you can change these values to whatever you'd like so after all these divs we're gonna put a div we're gonna give it a class of projects and then we're gonna give it an id of go down here and save that and inside of here we're going to give it a div and a class called project dash box and then we're going to do a a tag or an anchor tag inside of the anchor tag you're gonna do an image now i found this image offline if you want it it's down in the description along with everything else and so i just copied the uh image address and i pasted it and now we're going to add some alt text of port polio after that you're going to put an h2 tag and set the style to uh text dash align center and then we're just gonna put project as filler we're gonna do um we're just gonna do uh personal blog and then after this we're gonna copy this project box two more times we're gonna change the text from uh personal blog to java script bookmarker then we're just going to do um portfolio because i have a second portfolio and if we go ahead and check our browser so before we check the browser we're going to go to our style.css and we're going to make a projects and project project box and we're going to style these so for this one we're going to display flex make sure it's a semicolon and we're going to justify content into the center i'm going to do flex direction and we're going to do row and then flex wrap and then we're gonna do wrap that way if the browser gets smaller it will wrap and make it into a column instead of row and then we're just gonna set the height to 100 percent and down in the project box we're going to do margin 15 pixels we're going to do with 250 pixels and height 250 pixels i'm going to order we're gonna do border radius 25 pixels and then background color is going to be black make sure you set this project box to image i forgot about that so the styling won't work correctly without the image um that's just uh targeting the image part of the box we're gonna go ahead and change uh javascript bookmarker because it's kind of a long title and we're just gonna put um js book marker and reload and you should have it looking like this now um you can obviously switch out the pictures i just you i just used the same one for all three just for convenience you should probably change each one of these to your own pictures of your actual uh project but for now this is good after this we're going to add a div and we're going to call it um we're going to give it a class of about and we're going to give it an id of about and then we're going to put a div inside of it call and give it a class of about box i'm going to put an h2 tag in here call it about and then a paragraph tag and then i'mma copy and paste my about from earlier so i'm gonna just paste that in here and then go back and now we're gonna go into the styling and we're gonna add a class of about and about box just set the height to 35 vh not 25 35 and then we're going to set text align center set background color for the background color we're just going to use the same color we did for skills we're just going to paste it down here in semicolon we're going to display flex we're going to align items and then into the center and then we're gonna go down to the about box we're gonna give it a background color we're gonna set it to five e four seven nine nine semicolon and then order radius 25 pixels and then height of 20 vh makes you semicolon and then width is going to be 50 and then we're going to margin left about 25 pixels or a percent and just add a little bit of a padding bottom of five pixels change this four seven to seven four i messed up there it will give you purple if you type in four seven so make sure it's seven four you should get this blue color if you reload like this and it gives you a nice soft kind of grayish blue color that kind of looks nice on the eyes and also matches these pictures which i did not plan if you don't like the color scheme you can always change it there wasn't too much designing going into this um website it was mostly just to test every foundation function now one more thing we're just gonna um add another about box so about dash box comma paragraph tag and we're just going to set the padding on this for 5 pixels if you go back to your browser and you reload you see it just gives a nice padding to the the text of the so you can read it so after this we're going to give it another div we're going to add class to contact we're going to give it an id of contact it's just going to be an h2 of contact i just put user at domain for the email this is gonna be email just because i'm not gonna put my actual email but you guys should put your actual email if you want your employer to contact you also you don't have to put uh email sometimes it might get confusing it might annoy the user and then we're just gonna put paragraph and we're gonna put a phone number so i'm just putting some random numbers so actually we're just gonna go one two three four five six seven eight nine euro like that i don't know if that's a real phone number i wouldn't find out and after this we're gonna go to our style and we're gonna add a class of contact i'm going to set a background color to uh hashtag 006 ea d and then we're going to set a height of 20 vh and then text align center and then after that if you check your browser and you reload you should have this little blue thing down here contact and then email and phone number and obviously style is that easier this is just like looking like kind of a call out kind of after your body and you're going to type in a footer tag now we're going to just make a quick little footer just for convenience and it's just going to say shadow tech i copied and pasted a copyright sign offline and you can just save that you're going to go back to your style and you're just going to add footer and then you're just going to do text align center and then just set a background color and for convenience just gray and after that if you check your website you should have a fully completed um simple portfolio that was made completely from scratch completely from foundation and it was only in about 80 lines of css and around roughly 92 lines of html which is very small for a portfolio our html template was way more than that and this was this is a lot more than the template as well so you get more for less basically so more content for less lines of code for both uh portfolio and css so now that you've built your website in foundation there's a few more things that i think you guys should check out because they're kind of cool and it might be useful so if you go to foundation's website and you click getting started and then you click sites you see you get this little um page here and well this is where we found the html templates and there's some other things called building blocks now as it may seem you can literally click see code and add this to your um to your website and you can basically give ratings based off of you know like what you would be rating it on basically like you can copy this code click copy copy and copy and just paste each one in and you'd have to add your own javascript through a script tag inside of your uh website but that shouldn't be much of a problem and it basically gives you all the code for the um what it the building block is so in this case it's a star rating block and these are created by other people as you see this person made this but you can have your own profiles i guess but if you go back there's different things so you can go to navigation you can have these cool little uh navigations that people have made in foundation um status you can add status alerts and uh graphs and stuff um you can also do control and see social icons there's a lot of social buttons look at the social buttons easy so you can literally copy which parts you want so if i only wanted facebook twitter and youtube and instagram i would just copy these and then just copy all this because if you want to add more you can add more basically take out which links you want out and you can link in your own social media inside of these hashtags there's also mobile dashboards and instead of making our own hero we've could have we could have gone here and just clicked full screen hero and copy this code down here and could have done it that way but we decided to make it our own since we were creating our own website from scratch but if you do want to make another hero you can just come in here to the building blocks and find full screen hero and just edit it that way if you go back we go back all the way to where it says html templates you're gonna click uh resources and down here there's all sorts of addons for angular and for text editors and wordpress all this backend stuff and this is where we would connect the back end with like our buttons and stuff where is it down here django your net.net and uh it looks like other backend stuff like flask for python php um ass foundation anyway up here you can see there's uh icon fonts which are just some like random stuff i guess you could put into your website svg icons oh so like social media icons and if you click getting started this is where we downloaded uh you can click kitchen sink and obviously go through kitchen sink you click home it gives you like a description of how foundation works so uh 50 code reduction so half the size of foundation five this is foundation six so they've upgraded it and if you keep scrolling through you can read all about their development and how foundation is apparently the best uh frontend framework that's responsive in the world is what they claim so throughout this entire course or crash course we've learned a lot and let's go over what we have learned so we went through all of kitchen sync which gave us every element of foundation all in one let's say document and we saved that website just as foundation after that we went on to html templates and we basically learned how foundation is structured using one of their templates and we edited the template so that it looks like our personal pro portfolio then after that we basically made our own portfolio from scratch and we made it so that we coded the entire thing we basically coded the entire portfolio from scratch not using any templates or anything just using foundation and it gave us a 50 code reduction from the normal portfolio without foundation so basically um that's all for foundation i know this was a kind of a long crash course especially just for foundation but i made sure that you guys got all the content of foundation so don't forget to leave a like down below it
