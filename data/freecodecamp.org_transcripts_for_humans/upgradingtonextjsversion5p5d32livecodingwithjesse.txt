With timestamps:

00:07 - everybody welcome to live coding with
00:10 - Jesse and I was just finishing up with
00:13 - my lunch that's why I was two minutes
00:19 - late huh
00:26 - today we're gonna upgrade next js2 the
00:30 - latest version which is version 5 so
00:37 - let's see it doesn't look like it's
00:40 - gonna be too difficult but sometimes
00:47 - when you upgrade things other things
00:49 - break so maybe we'll work through some
00:52 - of that who knows maybe we'll upgrade
00:53 - everything will work and it'll be
00:55 - awesome and then left to figure out
00:57 - something else to do for the rest of the
00:58 - show let me get my g feel ready for my
01:05 - my caffeine hopefully I won't be yawning
01:08 - too much as always G fuel you can
01:15 - sponsor me if you want there's a music
01:20 - on and let's get started
01:31 - and yeah sorry I didn't stream yesterday
01:33 - I just I had meetings at like awkward
01:36 - times that didn't really allow me to
01:38 - have enough time in between that I felt
01:41 - like I could do a decent stream and then
01:44 - I end up that my later meeting didn't
01:47 - start till later than I thought but I
01:50 - didn't know it was gonna start later
01:53 - until too close to the meeting time so I
01:55 - probably could have gotten a stream in
01:58 - maybe next time I'll just try to fit one
02:00 - in and you know maybe a short stream is
02:04 - better than no stream I don't know let
02:06 - me know what you all think if you'd
02:09 - rather have like a half-hour long stream
02:12 - on those days when I have a lot of
02:14 - meetings instead of our normal you know
02:17 - hour hour and a half stream let me give
02:23 - you my screen here and I will point out
02:30 - after we do the upgrade then I want to
02:34 - talk a little bit about what's changed
02:35 - in our routing so Nikki did some really
02:41 - cool stuff with the router and I added
02:43 - just some slight modifications so I'd
02:46 - like to go over that a little bit later
02:49 - on first things first let's check out
02:55 - our well first thing let's let's start
02:58 - our timer
03:04 - here we are so after 25 minutes I'm
03:07 - gonna go to the live chat answer any
03:09 - questions you'll have so just hang in
03:11 - there and please be patient and I will
03:13 - get to your question all right so first
03:15 - things first let's just check out our
03:16 - package J so to see where we're coming
03:18 - from and this could probably be a bit
03:23 - bigger we don't really need a terminal
03:26 - just now and we won't need this for a
03:30 - little while so let's see what version
03:32 - of next week are using swarm for point
03:34 - two point three but what we want to do
03:38 - is move on to five right so here is the
03:47 - blog post announcing version five make
03:52 - it a bit bigger spread it out a little
03:56 - it's still pretty small on the screen
03:58 - huh all right maybe that's it so there's
04:03 - a lot of stuff in this post I'm not
04:06 - gonna just scroll and read this out on
04:08 - the stream but I will copy and paste the
04:10 - link into the live chat so you can see
04:13 - it and then I also put the link in the
04:15 - description to this video so if you're
04:17 - watching the recording later on just
04:18 - check the description you can go right
04:20 - to this blog post to read more there's
04:23 - some new features build times are not
04:25 - going to be faster they've they've set
04:30 - up webpack now I'm not huge on web pack
04:33 - set up in terms like I don't know all
04:36 - the ins and outs of how to do it but it
04:39 - seems as if now they're routing you know
04:43 - front and back-end stuff through web
04:46 - pack and now you can do things like do
04:50 - all this different stuff with CSS so we
04:53 - can do less set CSS CSS modules and they
04:56 - even have these plugins now so I'm gonna
04:58 - skip but you're welcome to read that on
05:02 - your own if you like but now they have
05:04 - these these plugins have CSS loaders for
05:07 - you know sass or or less right so that
05:11 - might be cool we could maybe instantly
05:14 - have some sass
05:17 - features in our in our next app so that
05:22 - would I wouldn't like that we have run
05:25 - sass with react before but it wasn't as
05:28 - easy as just putting a plug in and
05:30 - there's typescript support now I'd only
05:33 - use typescript so we're not going to
05:35 - really take advantage of that but if you
05:36 - like typescript now that is now
05:41 - available and let's see CSS
05:46 - preprocessors you just talked about that
05:52 - talked about module overloading which I
05:57 - don't really know that much about it it
05:59 - sounded cool though
06:02 - optional source maps in production so
06:09 - it's kind of cool there's some cool
06:12 - thing there are some things that I'm
06:13 - thinking like y'all probably use this
06:15 - and there are other things there like
06:17 - this is kind of cool not sure if I use
06:18 - it or not but all in all it seems like a
06:21 - pretty good pretty good update this
06:25 - Zones thing seems interesting basically
06:30 - running like multiple apps on one domain
06:34 - and then just having it be like
06:37 - obviously you can do subdomains and that
06:39 - multiple apps but this is talking about
06:41 - doing a subdirectory right you know so
06:44 - mydomain.com slash settings would be a
06:47 - completely different app living on a
06:48 - completely different server than
06:50 - mydomain.com so that i know that seems
06:55 - pretty cool new Docs and now it's easier
07:06 - to contribute to the docs which is cool
07:08 - let's see what else here's the one about
07:11 - the faster build time so they were able
07:13 - to achieve 23.6% faster production build
07:17 - times on their site on site what does it
07:21 - site dot see uh I can't remember what
07:24 - the site is yeah site site Co
07:33 - better caching for imports so they
07:35 - basically it from what I read it seems
07:40 - like before
07:42 - like on different builds your imports
07:45 - would have like different numbers at the
07:48 - end here so user would have to download
07:49 - that again but now what would happen is
07:52 - like if nothing changed in here when you
07:54 - have another build these numbers
07:55 - wouldn't change and so user wouldn't
07:57 - have to redownload that maybe I'm
08:03 - reading that wrong let me know if I'm if
08:05 - I'm missing that but that's what it
08:06 - seemed like what's going on here which
08:08 - is which is really cool I could have a
08:10 - you know definitely save your users some
08:12 - some data especially if they're on
08:14 - mobile that's a big deal but also you
08:18 - could achieve some you have quicker load
08:20 - times fragments all right so I don't
08:27 - know if we'll switch things up to this
08:30 - yet or not but it seems to me like we
08:35 - don't need to use some of the things
08:36 - that we were using in order to put in
08:40 - like title tags and things like that
08:43 - I believe maybe I'm wrong about this but
08:45 - it seems like it's built in now to next
08:49 - a different way to customize things like
08:51 - that better errors which is great
08:54 - because y'all know I get a lot of those
08:56 - so now maybe it'll be easier alright
09:00 - cool so that's my quick overview from
09:03 - you know from me reading about this
09:05 - earlier that that's what I remembered
09:08 - so now let's let's update so I'm gonna
09:12 - grab these and let's go back oops wrong
09:19 - one I've been migrating more data over
09:21 - so as always have more data so I'm gonna
09:27 - do a yarn add and I'm gonna paste these
09:33 - in so in case you can't read them I'm
09:34 - gonna read them out quickly so we have
09:36 - next at latest and then react at latest
09:40 - and react on
09:42 - at latest so let's hit enter and see
09:46 - what happens whoa actually hold on a
09:48 - second let's take this out of here let's
09:53 - go to a different branch and then hit
09:55 - enter that's weird let's get out of here
10:17 - get checkout and then do the B flag
10:20 - which I believe this will create the
10:22 - branch and put me on that branch at the
10:24 - same time which is always useful so you
10:26 - don't accidentally start committing
10:27 - things to the branch that you're on like
10:30 - master not realizing that you didn't
10:33 - move to the other branch which happens
10:35 - it's happened to me before okay so this
10:40 - is close branch next five awesome so now
10:47 - we have a new branch it's called next
10:49 - five and oops you decide yarn and there
10:58 - we are now let's hit enter and see what
11:01 - happens
11:10 - cool does very quick nice all right
11:16 - we'll verify here in our package.json
11:20 - not that I don't trust that it worked
11:22 - but let's see so we do we have next
11:25 - five great it looks like react and react
11:28 - Dom we're already at the latest versions
11:30 - which is nice and anything else change I
11:37 - don't think so this was these parts were
11:41 - probably just Auto formatting or
11:43 - something all right cool oh it looks
11:49 - like the stream wasn't working no why is
11:54 - the stream not working
12:00 - alright so it's definitely not like the
12:02 - CPU I'm not getting the fans running let
12:05 - me try I'm gonna try to plug in the
12:10 - ethernet cable I think I get faster
12:18 - speeds for the ethernet I that at least
12:20 - that's what I've been told I never
12:23 - really tested it out but I unplugged it
12:25 - because I can't migrate data over the
12:29 - ethernet cord for whatever reason now I
12:33 - can't find it
12:34 - I lost my Ethernet I'm have to stand up
12:38 - and cover the camera here so hold on
12:59 - all right hopefully that will help
13:04 - no I'm seeing drop down to nothing
13:08 - all right now we're back up maybe it
13:15 - just dropped down to nothing because it
13:16 - was switching over hopefully we'll be
13:19 - good all right okay cool so now let's
13:29 - just see what's happening with this
13:32 - now that we've upgraded let me find
13:36 - where I have this running there so have
13:40 - it up here
13:48 - I've lost it there it is okay so here's
13:58 - our app and I was on this page which
14:01 - didn't work before so I'm not worried
14:03 - about that but let's check the homepage
14:05 - and let's get our console up so we can
14:09 - see errors all right not bad not bad
14:17 - that works now let's try some routes
14:23 - all right faculty awesome that works let
14:33 - me restart the server as well just to be
14:36 - sure because with a with an update like
14:40 - that I like to do like a manual restart
14:46 - just to be sure let's refresh there we
14:53 - are okay there's some errors here so a
14:58 - free Actos server cool all right let me
15:05 - go back to the home page interesting
15:09 - all right so even our home page isn't
15:12 - working so let's try this out one thing
15:17 - we could do is go back to the
15:20 - documentation first that might not be a
15:24 - bad idea
15:25 - so let's go here and see what we might
15:33 - need to change
16:06 - all right I'm going pretty quickly
16:08 - through this so maybe missing something
16:09 - but it didn't seem like there was
16:11 - anything that said hey you need to
16:13 - change this for this to work
16:30 - okay let's see Harshit says try
16:40 - reinstalling react dom yeah we could
16:44 - reinstall that I mean we were trying to
16:47 - update that at the same time and let's
16:54 - see yeah I seen on the live chat so vibe
16:58 - vibe have really wants me to answer a
17:01 - question so just hold on I'm gonna do
17:03 - questions in about ten minutes okay we
17:10 - could
17:20 - yeah let's do Rex could not resolve
17:26 - react on server in node modules reactive
17:30 - hallo hey here's Alicia do why not do
17:37 - this the old RM RF node modules and then
17:41 - just reinstall maybe maybe it'll work
17:46 - and maybe it'll save a lot of time so
17:48 - let's do that if you never use this
17:50 - before sometimes it can fix all your
17:53 - problems
17:54 - you don't necessarily know what the
17:55 - problem was but it does fix it so let's
18:01 - try it
18:02 - RM RF oh wait okay our says you
18:09 - found he found the air okay alright node
18:12 - modules your life has been spared from
18:14 - now it's in the babble RC all right
18:19 - let's check it out
18:32 - I guess I could turn on where we have a
18:38 - concern on Angra so you all can see the
18:42 - errors as well I'm gonna pace this over
18:50 - so you can click on the link I just
18:53 - paste it in the live chat and then you
18:55 - can have beautiful errors right on your
18:59 - screen just like I do
19:13 - alright well let's take a look then for
19:17 - a second here at our babble or si
19:33 - all right so it says try commenting out
19:35 - the module resolvers stuff so we can
19:39 - probably call them out coming out
19:43 - everything here right
19:52 - or actually just this right
20:15 - we can't comment out in JSON so let me
20:19 - just remove it then
20:32 - all right
20:38 - let me restart the server just to be
20:45 - sure
20:56 - cool all right that worked let's check
21:01 - out some other pages nope
21:09 - all right so this isn't working probably
21:11 - because we're actually using some graph
21:13 - QL stuff here but this is a different
21:21 - error than we had before so I think this
21:23 - error was caused by us removing all that
21:27 - stuff about plugins so I'm going to put
21:33 - this back in and see what Wow well you
21:45 - see what we can do so evidently we need
21:52 - this part for all of our our pages to
21:56 - work except the home page so we can't
21:59 - just take it out
22:16 - it's so hard who's probably the one
22:21 - that made this file in the first place
22:24 - is saying remove the dollar sign so I
22:29 - will try that
22:30 - hey there we go it works let's try a
22:36 - different page film study No
23:03 - let's try another one
23:05 - I'm not 100% sure that that route worked
23:07 - anyway all right yeah it must be
23:18 - shoot
23:31 - why did that other page work I don't
23:37 - know why it works for a minute oh all
23:48 - right so I should say and restart yeah
23:50 - so we didn't restart yeah let's let's
23:52 - try that
23:52 - I didn't restart because it looked like
23:54 - it worked automatically so let's give it
23:58 - a shot here
24:09 - nope still there's
24:24 - I'm gonna get out of this view so I can
24:29 - zoom in a bit more ever so i'll ReactOS
24:41 - okay i'm gonna remove hard should say
24:44 - and remove the this little guy - sorry
24:49 - about that hard I wasn't paying
24:51 - attention in the live chat okay
24:55 - no let's restart it
25:19 - mmm
25:36 - all right so let me check my timer all
25:40 - right we got about two minutes left and
25:41 - then I'll go back to the live chat and I
25:44 - answer some questions but it's saying
25:47 - the dependency was not found
26:00 - I'm thinking it still might be worth it
26:03 - to do our MRF and reload everything not
26:14 - really a big deal for me I've got lots
26:17 - of bandwidth
26:46 - all right so I've just deleted all my
26:49 - node modules please don't run RM RF if
26:54 - you're not a hundred percent sure you
26:56 - want everything deleted in that
26:58 - particular folder because it will be
27:02 - deleted forever you won't be able to get
27:03 - it back but I can get all my node
27:09 - modules back just by typing yarn so
27:12 - that's what I'm gonna do and the timer
27:18 - should be going off very soon so
27:29 - let's see I don't think we're gonna get
27:32 - anything else done 30 seconds oh cool it
27:37 - finished I don't think it finished fast
27:39 - enough let's restart this
28:05 - dependency not found hmm all right well
28:15 - that's it for that session so let me
28:17 - take a 5-minute break I'm gonna go back
28:19 - to the live chat if anybody has any
28:20 - ideas for how we can fix this error that
28:25 - we're getting please put it in the live
28:26 - chat now I'll come back to it we'll give
28:28 - it another shot after the five minutes
28:30 - are up
28:31 - also it's really hot in my office so I'm
28:34 - going to take my sweater off see Gander
28:43 - says anyone else going to watch the
28:45 - SpaceX heavy Falcon launch as well maybe
28:49 - I don't know what time it's on the
28:52 - anybody know what time it's on for
28:54 - Eastern Time
29:00 - don't worry about if you don't know I
29:02 - won't take me that long to look it up
29:04 - but it might be cool to watch with my
29:06 - kids later on as long as it's not too
29:08 - late old so I says hello everyone hey
29:13 - how's it going thanks for watching and I
29:16 - miss everyone I don't know about you I
29:18 - don't have anybody missed me but now
29:20 - that I'm talking with you oh and
29:21 - everything I did I miss I miss y'all I
29:25 - tell you what it's really really easy
29:27 - for me when I come in to just be lazy
29:30 - and say like I'm not gonna stream today
29:32 - you know I gotta you know get the
29:35 - thumbnail ready for the video put the
29:37 - info and schedule the stream you know
29:39 - and it's not really that much all that
29:43 - can be done in less than 20 minutes you
29:45 - know probably less than 15 but sometimes
29:51 - it's easy for me to be lazy and not
29:52 - stream like yesterday probably could
29:55 - have squeezed one in but it's like oh
29:59 - well if it's not the right conditions
30:01 - let's just not do it
30:02 - but once I'm actually here with you all
30:05 - I really love it so anyway just wanted
30:10 - to tell you how much I appreciate you
30:16 - she AB ass please give me a complete
30:21 - guideline to be a developer I'm not sure
30:25 - I can give you a complete guideline and
30:27 - in the time that we have right now but I
30:30 - would say as a rough kind of outline
30:34 - learn HTML and CSS probably learn things
30:37 - in this order if you want to be a
30:38 - front-end developer or even a full-stack
30:41 - developer learn things and do it in this
30:43 - order HTML CSS basics right you don't
30:47 - need to get too in-depth then go into
30:49 - JavaScript it's probably not a bad idea
30:52 - to learn a little bit of jQuery it's it
30:55 - can get your confidence up and
30:56 - realistically you'll probably be able to
30:58 - find a lot of jobs that require jQuery
31:01 - so depending on what your circumstances
31:03 - are it might be beneficial to you
31:05 - otherwise just stick with JavaScript and
31:09 - start building things if you want to be
31:12 - full stack and moving to back-end then
31:14 - learn node that'll be the easiest jump
31:16 - for you to make from javis like
31:18 - client-side JavaScript to get into the
31:20 - backend and then you'll probably want to
31:23 - learn a little bit more about api's and
31:24 - databases and things if you want to just
31:26 - stick with front-end though
31:28 - stick with your JavaScript and then if
31:30 - you want to check out something like
31:32 - angular or react or view to help help
31:35 - you out you'll go with that if you want
31:37 - to be able to follow on with these
31:38 - streams definitely check out react and
31:39 - it probably couldn't hurt to check out
31:42 - some sort of UI framework like material
31:44 - UI fusing react or materialized CSS or
31:47 - bootstrap or foundation or something
31:50 - like that depending on how much you like
31:52 - the design CSS side of things if you
31:55 - really like doing it yourself then maybe
31:56 - you don't want to use a framework but in
31:59 - any case it is it's good to at least be
32:01 - knowledgeable of those frameworks and
32:03 - how things are done in them because
32:05 - those are like common design patterns
32:07 - the users are familiar with so even if
32:09 - you don't want to use them I still think
32:12 - it's it's a good idea to be familiar
32:14 - with them so anyway that's like kind of
32:16 - my just outline of what to learn if you
32:20 - want to ask me know maybe I'll do a
32:23 - video of more
32:24 - in-depth stuff if anyone's interested in
32:26 - that let me know would you like me to do
32:28 - a video or a series of videos outlining
32:32 - a good plan for what to learn and when
32:35 - to become a developer if you like it
32:39 - just leave some in the live chat leave
32:40 - something in the comments of the video
32:42 - or something like that
32:43 - and then if enough of you are interested
32:45 - then I'll kind of make more of an effort
32:47 - to to do that also I says maybe in short
32:54 - streams you could do question and answer
32:55 - actually that's not a bad idea if I'm
32:58 - doing a short one maybe I'll just say
32:59 - like hey this is just a cute I stream
33:02 - yeah yeah cuz it is kind of difficult to
33:05 - get much work done and just like a half
33:07 - an hour but question answer would be
33:10 - pretty easy that's a pretty good idea
33:14 - thanks Brooke says about the routing I'm
33:18 - sure that code can be rewritten about
33:20 - half the lines while being clearer and
33:22 - more performant Oh Nicki don't I I know
33:26 - I already told you in the the comments
33:29 - to that PR but I think it was genius I
33:33 - mean it was really good is the only
33:35 - thing I had to change and I we can talk
33:38 - more about it is routes that weren't
33:41 - included in that that object where we're
33:46 - actually bringing up an error so I just
33:50 - had to put a change it up just a little
33:52 - bit to make sure that those routes
33:54 - actually did end up going to the
33:56 - universal route but other than that it
34:01 - was was great all right let's get back
34:06 - to the code and let me write down where
34:12 - I'm leaving off
34:18 - Yeah right and if anybody's interested
34:23 - in doing some refactoring with that you
34:25 - know hey you know feel free to take a
34:29 - shot at it you know as long as the
34:32 - functionality remains the same and it's
34:33 - still readable that would be awesome
34:38 - let's see here we go okay I'm gonna
34:43 - check the bottom of the live chat
34:44 - quickly to see if anyone had any more
34:47 - ideas about Harsin it looks like Harshit
34:52 - made a pull request
34:53 - I didn't even merge this it's already
35:01 - made a pull request let's check it out
35:04 - all right let's go to github and once I
35:14 - get in here I will make it bigger there
35:17 - we are and best feather okay cool so
35:23 - let's check out the file first so we can
35:25 - see so harsh it has put in roots source
35:32 - no way that's awesome so that was the
35:33 - only thing to change all right hard
35:35 - do you want to get credit for this pull
35:37 - request I will merge it in or do you
35:39 - want me to just copy and paste this let
35:42 - me know I'm more than happy to give you
35:46 - credit and actually merge this pull
35:47 - request see
35:59 - our she says just copy and paste okay
36:02 - that's cool
36:21 - urgent says I made this as you might
36:24 - have forgot the carrots hole file why do
36:28 - I need to do the whole file it just
36:31 - changed one thing
36:48 - hold on a second modules over alias
36:55 - okay so right above alias
37:04 - I know you thought you thought I was
37:07 - gonna forget all the stuff that I change
37:09 - right
37:10 - but that control-z is my friend all
37:19 - right hey well at least we got a fresh
37:23 - new node modules folder right so
37:32 - restarting
37:53 - hmm
37:55 - it's not working for me yes that will
37:58 - check I'm gonna pull over harsh it's
38:05 - code on my other screen so I can compare
38:08 - exactly what it was
38:27 - okay so it is exactly the same I mean
38:30 - the formatting is a little different but
39:11 - oh yeah still same air
39:23 - same thing okay hmm
39:40 - michael says is react Apollo even in
39:43 - node modules I I would imagine it would
39:52 - be let's check it out don't need it at
39:57 - blank file there what's this this is
40:00 - some cool stuff I'll have to share that
40:02 - with you soon I thought I already had it
40:09 - open I guess not
40:10 - there's my package.json there we are
40:13 - that's a good thought though Michael
40:16 - it's worth checking it out
40:19 - Apollo yep yep react Apollo here
40:46 - modules can't resolve react on server in
41:01 - we react Apollo
41:15 - we could dive into node module and here
41:19 - see what's going on
41:33 - here's the thing I don't get I like
41:35 - really we didn't change react Dom we
41:41 - didn't change react Apollo that's what
41:46 - we're getting the air from react on
41:49 - server and react Apollo that kind of
42:00 - bothers me
42:13 - I would get another arrow down here I
42:16 - know it's hard to see
43:16 - yeah this was sure fine it's never
43:19 - modules tab who lives have Jess
43:44 - okay arch says try removing what is that
43:51 - called the caret sign and the dollar
43:52 - sign after this all right let's give
43:59 - that a shot my Babel save dad
44:31 - no same thing all right so let's change
44:37 - that back I don't like to you know so
44:42 - this is what that that file is looking
44:45 - for react om server so react Apollo
44:51 - somewhere it's searching for react on
44:57 - server
45:18 - alright it looks like this dream cut out
45:21 - but now it's back alright
45:23 - sorry about the stream I just I don't
45:26 - know what's going on with it today I
45:27 - haven't changed anything about OBS
45:30 - settings I don't know
45:33 - okay so harsh is saying remove the cache
45:37 - from the node modules which I did not do
45:41 - before so let's do RM RF node modules
45:44 - slash cache and the next one
45:57 - why is it not found of course it's there
45:59 - maybe it's just something with the
46:00 - copying
46:17 - area
46:34 - that's weird so Microsoft Outlook is
46:37 - giving me a notification right now for a
46:40 - meeting that was cancelled it even tells
46:42 - me cancelled and it's not I was telling
46:45 - me I have 11 minutes to get this meeting
46:47 - with that seems like it's something it
46:51 - should not be doing
46:58 - see all right
47:02 - so say that wasn't it as well
47:07 - yeah same error and you know
47:19 - raluchi she was the ADA
47:50 - okay so saying
48:20 - that's odd
48:33 - all right so yes I don't you'll see that
48:35 - when I mouse over doesn't that look like
48:37 - an odd path
48:50 - yes
49:33 - all right so in react Dom or server
49:37 - digest is just this we also have
51:07 - I mean the only thing I can see is that
51:12 - react Apollo is once a an older version
51:17 - of react Dom
51:34 - I mean again that just it doesn't make
51:37 - that much sense because let's sit this
51:41 - no I Donnie Eric for working with Saddam
51:47 - down here it has a different version
52:06 - hmm
52:14 - all right let me let me go with the left
52:16 - has to go saying Michael is saying why
52:18 - not just reinstall react Dom server like
52:21 - the message says I mean well I mean
52:26 - technically we just reinstalled
52:27 - everything right when we removed all our
52:32 - node modules
53:03 - see
54:02 - it looks like someone else had a similar
54:04 - problem with a previous version of next
54:07 - so there's an issue a closed issue on
54:10 - next J s repo trying to scroll down to
54:15 - see what what happened with that
54:53 - yes
55:11 - I kind of thought we'd have errors I
55:14 - just thought I would have a little bit
55:18 - easier time getting through it alright
55:24 - so I'm going to paste in the to live
55:27 - chat the issue that I'm seeing right now
55:29 - in case anyone else is interested and
55:31 - then I'll pull it over onto the screen
55:33 - so you can see you can see what I'm
55:37 - looking at right now so I was a little
55:40 - skeptical because this issue was from
55:42 - June of 2017 so I figured like an issue
55:46 - that old has probably already been taken
55:48 - care of but it looks like it maybe
55:51 - wasn't so even after the issue was
55:53 - closed we have the issue still happening
55:57 - oh this is still happening in beta
56:03 - version of next
56:30 - mm-hmm in this case if the app is built
56:35 - everything works but in development it
56:39 - doesn't work
56:48 - all right so there is a fix
56:56 - Oh Gander has to go hey again or thanks
57:00 - for joining us I'll see you later
57:03 - John Hanson says I saw some stuff on the
57:06 - web similar issue NPM babble plug-in
57:09 - module was over and create an alias
57:11 - module resolver for reacts Apollo in
57:14 - Belvoir see
57:47 - mm-hmm I'm just not finding really new
57:52 - issues I'd rather have something newer
57:56 - but I mean I guess potentially if this
57:59 - issue just happened again with this
58:02 - release then there's there's not gonna
58:04 - be a lot oh wow
58:10 - almost to the end of another 25-minute
58:13 - session here really glad I did this in a
58:20 - separate branch
58:32 - I think it's a really really long shot
58:35 - that this will works and so much has
58:37 - changed since this version of next but I
58:40 - think it's worth a shot let's see
58:49 - ying-ying ye so I'm not sure how to
58:52 - pronounce your name so why ing j IE
58:56 - please let me know how to pronounce it
58:58 - I'd love to pronounce it correctly for
58:59 - you but anyway it says there's no super
59:02 - chat here now I haven't done the super
59:04 - chat at all is there an advantage to
59:06 - doing the super chat if so let me know
59:14 - alright let me make this file really
59:18 - quickly just to see if it works and then
59:20 - I'll go back and go through everything
59:22 - the live chat so it's saying do this and
59:25 - where that's it's closed up these node
59:31 - modules modules close this
60:07 - ooh
60:09 - if you
60:18 - you know what this isn't gonna work this
60:24 - person's issue also I had to do with
60:31 - change effectuation of different sized
60:33 - shoes
60:38 - and it also had to do with type scripts
60:58 - hmm
61:03 - oh okay so it seems like super with
61:07 - super chat you can make so you can get
61:10 - donations that's pretty cool I'm not
61:15 - gonna start doing it for free code camp
61:17 - stream unless that's what Quincy wants
61:20 - so right now I'm not gonna use it but
61:23 - I'll definitely keep that in mind that's
61:25 - that's pretty interesting all right
61:29 - her shirt says he's got it so I'm gonna
61:31 - wait for more on that from Harshit and
61:34 - in the meantime I'm gonna go up to latch
61:36 - at where I left off and I'm gonna answer
61:38 - some questions
61:52 - Nietzsche says Oh wowthat's today
61:54 - bleeding-edge stuff right here yeah it
61:56 - just came out I actually thank Harshad
61:58 - for hearts just sent me a message was it
62:02 - a message no I think it was an issue I
62:04 - should open an issue on this repo saying
62:06 - that next five came out so I saw that
62:10 - check it out this morning if the
62:11 - holidays maybe this would be cool for a
62:13 - stream
62:37 - let's see
62:45 - on Hill says hi hey how's it going son
62:53 - bassist Jesse the hacker in which
62:56 - company do you work right now I work for
62:58 - a small University called Franciscan
63:00 - University of stupid about five of us
63:11 - there are so many frameworks of
63:13 - JavaScript like react angular of UJS
63:16 - ember meteor etc we have to learn all of
63:20 - them to become a good developer oh no
63:23 - way no way you don't have to learn all
63:24 - of them you could be a good developer no
63:27 - none of them and just use JavaScript or
63:31 - you could just learn one of them and be
63:33 - really good in fact I would think if you
63:36 - knew all of them you probably wouldn't
63:38 - be really good at any of them usually
63:42 - take specialization to become really
63:44 - good so yeah don't worry about that you
63:46 - don't I mean it'd be good to know a
63:48 - little bit about each one just so that
63:50 - you can accurately assess whether which
63:53 - one would be best for a particular
63:54 - project that you you're about to work on
63:58 - but don't you certainly don't have to
64:01 - really learn every one of them and it
64:06 - says hey hey how's it going
64:08 - glad you could make it for the latch at
64:25 - Gander has said the RM RF node modules
64:28 - doesn't fix as much as it used to
64:31 - since NPM self-clean since version 5 all
64:35 - right good to know good to know maybe I
64:38 - won't be so quick to try it next time
64:40 - then
64:52 - again just said the SpaceX launch is
64:55 - actually going on like right now liftoff
65:00 - is at 2:20 Eastern Time
65:03 - alright cool well I'm gonna try to end
65:05 - the stream before then so y'all can
65:06 - watch the launch if you want to I'm high
65:14 - school Creole said I thought you just
65:15 - had a hangover from watching the
65:16 - Superbowl not actually I didn't even
65:18 - watch the Super Bowl this year
65:20 - I just watched like a kids movie with
65:23 - with my kids and went to sleep I'm
65:30 - actually a Pittsburgh Steelers fan and
65:32 - they weren't in it and just wasn't that
65:36 - into it this year James says Jessie
65:41 - beard is looking awesome this beard is
65:44 - looking awesome bro I appreciate it
65:47 - thank you it is getting a little long
65:49 - and you can't thankfully you can't tell
65:51 - on the camera at least I can't tell from
65:54 - seeing OBS but it's starting to get a
65:57 - little gray I got some gray hairs right
66:00 - here on the chin my wife laughs when she
66:03 - sees that so I don't know we'll see how
66:08 - it looks once the stars turned gray
66:09 - maybe I'll look better
66:10 - who knows I'll look more distinguished
66:15 - right with gray
66:32 - divya says it's completely off-topic but
66:37 - do people use react with django apps i
66:40 - have never heard of anyone usually react
66:43 - with django but i mean that that it
66:46 - certainly people could be doing it i
66:49 - just don't know about it i don't know
66:51 - much at all about django I've never used
66:53 - it so i'm i probably can't give you a
66:55 - good answer has anyone else heard of
66:58 - anything like that allen word says
67:05 - thumbs up for the video on getting
67:07 - started and motivation on day 21 of 100
67:10 - days of code and life got in the way and
67:13 - had to take a week off now it's hard to
67:15 - get started again thanks for everything
67:16 - you rock I really appreciate you telling
67:19 - me that and I'm glad that you liked the
67:23 - video hopefully it's helping you out
67:25 - maybe I'll have to I'll have to make
67:29 - another one here because I've added in
67:31 - some things into my daily routine that
67:33 - have really helped since I made that
67:35 - video and I think it could be helpful
67:37 - for some people so maybe I have to make
67:41 - a part 2 or something along those lines
67:45 - yeah but I appreciate you telling me
67:48 - that when I get feedback like that then
67:49 - I mean it's good because I know what
67:52 - what kind of content is helpful for
67:54 - people Aleksey says hey hey how's it
68:03 - going world's us why didn't you just
68:06 - leave next yes version 4 we certainly
68:09 - could have left next version 4 version 5
68:11 - did have some improvements that I liked
68:14 - so it was easier to integrate sass the
68:18 - build speed was faster so I don't know
68:23 - did we have to probably not but it I
68:27 - mean while we're still developing it
68:29 - it's a heck of a lot easier I think now
68:31 - before everything's are all built out to
68:33 - update like this that way if we do have
68:37 - problems there's just less code to look
68:41 - through to try to find the problem
68:44 - I mean if we really can't figure this
68:45 - out we can always just flip back to the
68:47 - master branch and come back and try
68:50 - again at some another time but I still
68:52 - have a lot of data in my grade so I
68:54 - don't really need to work on this repo
68:56 - you know right away
68:59 - so we'll see I it's worth giving it a
69:03 - little bit more time all right it just
69:10 - automatically popped me back down to the
69:14 - bottom of the live chat and I see that
69:19 - Harshit is typing in all caps which
69:22 - means that he's got something for me oh
69:28 - you know I had to leave so it was too
69:32 - late here I gotta go to sleep all right
69:33 - well good night Anna thanks for joining
69:36 - us let's see see this got it we're gonna
69:44 - see this oh I should says do the work
69:51 - around in there
70:01 - so hard were you talking about that
70:03 - workaround that I was just going to make
70:37 - so like this in the issues okay oh I
70:50 - should that's a good point arch it says
70:51 - remember to back up the WordPress
70:53 - install because it could set me back
70:54 - that is very very good point
71:19 - I'll shoot I know I did that because
71:25 - this was supposed to be typescript
71:38 - now this type shift even gonna work for
71:41 - me in here will automatically work with
71:43 - next five or you have to set that up I
71:45 - guess we'll find out really soon
71:59 - we had a flash of content yeah remove
72:05 - that show all right remove the any
72:22 - okay
72:26 - the suppose I could take the typescript
72:28 - off of here now
73:11 - all right so we still have some stuff
73:15 - going on suspected digit because of you
73:21 - syntax error number all right we got
73:24 - some syntax errors stuff going on here
73:26 - but we it worked let's try some other
73:35 - pages now I'm not happy yet because I'm
73:45 - I'm like waiting to see if something
73:50 - else breaks I'm not convinced yet all
73:55 - right now I'm pretty convinced all right
74:03 - all right cool now I can smile and be
74:08 - happy
74:11 - cool
74:12 - all right so this was pretty cool
74:19 - hopefully this will be helpful for
74:20 - anybody who's trying to upgrade now I
74:24 - guess not everybody's gonna have the
74:25 - same configuration that we had so it
74:27 - probably won't happen for a lot of
74:29 - people I don't know but here was the
74:33 - deal right so we upgraded and we ended
74:39 - up having to add next dot config dot J s
74:43 - file ok just down here in our main
74:46 - folder right and we had to put module
74:49 - exports and looks this deletes some
74:54 - aliases so this is what we had to put in
74:59 - there alright now this will be in the
75:01 - repo soon once I push this so you can
75:07 - you know copy and paste this use this
75:09 - file if you need to for what you're
75:11 - doing and hopefully it'll help you cool
75:19 - Oh Nikki's Nikki's computer crashed
75:27 - basically because of the same error and
75:30 - so Nikki missed the fix so this is the
75:33 - fix this right here so I'll I'll push
75:40 - this let's push this now do you think
75:44 - we're safe enough now to merge this into
75:46 - master
76:07 - hmm
76:28 - what are you what would we call a commit
76:30 - that's just updating packages
76:42 - there are dependencies
76:56 - michael says don't merge it yet alright
76:58 - well I'll just keep it on this branch
77:00 - for now
77:15 - all right so we're just gonna say this
77:17 - is build I mean really the the the piece
77:22 - of this that we could most immediately
77:24 - benefit from anyway is that we'll have
77:26 - faster build time so that kind of makes
77:30 - sense
77:38 - oops I should saying it's a chore so we
77:51 - should say put it under chore all right
78:06 - all right thanks up
78:29 - are there any breaking changes there
78:33 - were we fixed them yes it does affect
78:38 - any an open issue what issue is that
78:45 - let's see I don't remember what issue of
78:52 - us have to look it up
79:02 - seventy-five
79:20 - uh you know we have to pass all the
79:22 - tests
79:34 - did we pass yay all right
79:51 - all right cool so we do have a branch in
79:55 - our github repo now that is for next
79:58 - five so if you want to see any of the
80:00 - stuff that we just did today
80:02 - check out that next five branch we're
80:04 - not gonna merge it yet Michael I think
80:09 - as has the right idea here is not to
80:12 - merge it yet double check make sure
80:14 - things work give it a little bit more
80:17 - time to test then we can merge it when
80:19 - we're when we're sure all right cool let
80:25 - me try to get through the rest of the
80:26 - questions in the live chat and no I said
80:32 - I'd try to be done before the rocket
80:34 - launch sorry about that
80:36 - totally understand if you were watching
80:38 - this and watch the launch I'll still go
80:46 - through and answer the questions though
81:30 - all right let's see you know what I
81:34 - don't think I marked where I left off I
81:35 - just have to read some of it
81:55 - Niq alright I see now where Nicky said
81:58 - that the lab saw the blue screen of
82:01 - death out of the blue on this last hub
82:25 - nick says this looks hard I learned PHP
82:29 - well PHP looks hard to me so that's yes
82:34 - it just depends on what you're more used
82:36 - to working with Oh harsh it says the
82:40 - Instagram uses Django with react well
82:43 - that's that's a really big example thank
82:45 - you for bringing that up
82:51 - Lexi says can you run react alongside
82:53 - with express in next Jas
82:56 - yeah that's we have let me show you my
82:59 - server the server JS file here yeah so
83:04 - we've got Express running we have next
83:06 - running obviously react so it's all it's
83:10 - all running together nick says where can
83:14 - I learn about cyber security for free
83:16 - thanks for your apply I don't know for
83:21 - sure I've not taken cyber security curse
83:23 - courses well I think that but I did do
83:25 - some of the course on Udacity so I
83:30 - believe Udacity has some courses or at
83:33 - least one course on cyber security that
83:36 - you can take for free I imagine there
83:39 - are a lot of courses on on udemy that
83:42 - probably aren't free so I would check
83:44 - out the one for Udacity from what I
83:46 - remember of it it was actually taught by
83:48 - some people who are really kind of like
83:52 - big names in the field of cyber security
83:55 - they have literally written you know the
83:59 - authoritative books on cybersecurity so
84:02 - check that out first
84:05 - I'd say that's probably a good place to
84:07 - start
84:12 - also says while you're doing your
84:13 - project are you concerned about security
84:16 - website like CSRF attacks equal Jacksons
84:21 - or that is not a possibility a front-end
84:24 - developer or at least Fernandez should
84:26 - know these this stuff yeah so we
84:30 - definitely try to keep that stuff in
84:32 - mind for just purely front-end stuff
84:37 - it's
84:38 - there are different things to be
84:40 - concerned about but you know potentially
84:45 - by using so this is where I see the big
84:49 - advantage of using established like
84:52 - pre-made things as as opposed to
84:55 - creating everything on our own you build
84:59 - things from scratch they just haven't
85:00 - been tested but if we're using things
85:02 - that that have been tested like for
85:04 - instance wordpress order managing
85:08 - content through wordpress very well none
85:12 - frequently updated mostly updates a lot
85:16 - of the updates have security updates in
85:19 - them as well so we don't have to purse
85:22 - like act like know all the different
85:24 - threats out there as long as we have a
85:27 - reliable you know maintainer so the
85:32 - people who maintain wordpress are pretty
85:35 - on top of things one of the biggest
85:37 - threats for WordPress is plugins that
85:40 - are out of date so in terms of plugins
85:43 - I'm very careful about what I install
85:45 - and what I use and if it's a plug-in
85:47 - that doesn't seem like it will be
85:49 - updated or it's no longer maintained I
85:51 - make sure I take a look at the code you
85:54 - know as best as I can with my limited
85:56 - knowledge of PHP and and try to really
85:59 - understand what's happening so yeah so I
86:06 - guess I say I'm worried about it that's
86:09 - one of the reasons why I think upgrading
86:11 - plugins and things is important
86:13 - especially if you become aware that
86:15 - there's a security issue I do have some
86:18 - people in the computer science
86:20 - department and that are interested in
86:24 - doing some penetration testing so
86:27 - hopefully we can get that set up and
86:30 - working and you know so people that are
86:35 - more knowledgeable about security than I
86:37 - am can really kind of check things out
86:39 - and make recommendations
86:48 - okay I'm gonna have to go pretty quick
86:51 - and wrap this up so I just got a message
86:54 - that the head of the department needs to
86:55 - meet with me because and it may have to
86:59 - do with this website so definitely don't
87:04 - want to keep her waiting
87:16 - I know says this project is getting good
87:19 - that is nice see they keep pushing okay
87:23 - michael says they keep pushing to launch
87:25 - back now it's a 90 minutes okay well at
87:27 - least we didn't miss it okay I got to
87:35 - the end of the live chat sorry I'm have
87:37 - to just cut it off right there so maybe
87:39 - join us for another chat if you have
87:41 - some more questions thank you so much
87:43 - for all the help and working through
87:44 - these issues thankfully we you know we
87:46 - got it all working but I really
87:49 - appreciate all the help and I should be
87:52 - back tomorrow until then have a great
87:55 - day

Cleaned transcript:

everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse and I was just finishing up with my lunch that's why I was two minutes late huh today we're gonna upgrade next js2 the latest version which is version 5 so let's see it doesn't look like it's gonna be too difficult but sometimes when you upgrade things other things break so maybe we'll work through some of that who knows maybe we'll upgrade everything will work and it'll be awesome and then left to figure out something else to do for the rest of the show let me get my g feel ready for my my caffeine hopefully I won't be yawning too much as always G fuel you can sponsor me if you want there's a music on and let's get started and yeah sorry I didn't stream yesterday I just I had meetings at like awkward times that didn't really allow me to have enough time in between that I felt like I could do a decent stream and then I end up that my later meeting didn't start till later than I thought but I didn't know it was gonna start later until too close to the meeting time so I probably could have gotten a stream in maybe next time I'll just try to fit one in and you know maybe a short stream is better than no stream I don't know let me know what you all think if you'd rather have like a halfhour long stream on those days when I have a lot of meetings instead of our normal you know hour hour and a half stream let me give you my screen here and I will point out after we do the upgrade then I want to talk a little bit about what's changed in our routing so Nikki did some really cool stuff with the router and I added just some slight modifications so I'd like to go over that a little bit later on first things first let's check out our well first thing let's let's start our timer here we are so after 25 minutes I'm gonna go to the live chat answer any questions you'll have so just hang in there and please be patient and I will get to your question all right so first things first let's just check out our package J so to see where we're coming from and this could probably be a bit bigger we don't really need a terminal just now and we won't need this for a little while so let's see what version of next week are using swarm for point two point three but what we want to do is move on to five right so here is the blog post announcing version five make it a bit bigger spread it out a little it's still pretty small on the screen huh all right maybe that's it so there's a lot of stuff in this post I'm not gonna just scroll and read this out on the stream but I will copy and paste the link into the live chat so you can see it and then I also put the link in the description to this video so if you're watching the recording later on just check the description you can go right to this blog post to read more there's some new features build times are not going to be faster they've they've set up webpack now I'm not huge on web pack set up in terms like I don't know all the ins and outs of how to do it but it seems as if now they're routing you know front and backend stuff through web pack and now you can do things like do all this different stuff with CSS so we can do less set CSS CSS modules and they even have these plugins now so I'm gonna skip but you're welcome to read that on your own if you like but now they have these these plugins have CSS loaders for you know sass or or less right so that might be cool we could maybe instantly have some sass features in our in our next app so that would I wouldn't like that we have run sass with react before but it wasn't as easy as just putting a plug in and there's typescript support now I'd only use typescript so we're not going to really take advantage of that but if you like typescript now that is now available and let's see CSS preprocessors you just talked about that talked about module overloading which I don't really know that much about it it sounded cool though optional source maps in production so it's kind of cool there's some cool thing there are some things that I'm thinking like y'all probably use this and there are other things there like this is kind of cool not sure if I use it or not but all in all it seems like a pretty good pretty good update this Zones thing seems interesting basically running like multiple apps on one domain and then just having it be like obviously you can do subdomains and that multiple apps but this is talking about doing a subdirectory right you know so mydomain.com slash settings would be a completely different app living on a completely different server than mydomain.com so that i know that seems pretty cool new Docs and now it's easier to contribute to the docs which is cool let's see what else here's the one about the faster build time so they were able to achieve 23.6% faster production build times on their site on site what does it site dot see uh I can't remember what the site is yeah site site Co better caching for imports so they basically it from what I read it seems like before like on different builds your imports would have like different numbers at the end here so user would have to download that again but now what would happen is like if nothing changed in here when you have another build these numbers wouldn't change and so user wouldn't have to redownload that maybe I'm reading that wrong let me know if I'm if I'm missing that but that's what it seemed like what's going on here which is which is really cool I could have a you know definitely save your users some some data especially if they're on mobile that's a big deal but also you could achieve some you have quicker load times fragments all right so I don't know if we'll switch things up to this yet or not but it seems to me like we don't need to use some of the things that we were using in order to put in like title tags and things like that I believe maybe I'm wrong about this but it seems like it's built in now to next a different way to customize things like that better errors which is great because y'all know I get a lot of those so now maybe it'll be easier alright cool so that's my quick overview from you know from me reading about this earlier that that's what I remembered so now let's let's update so I'm gonna grab these and let's go back oops wrong one I've been migrating more data over so as always have more data so I'm gonna do a yarn add and I'm gonna paste these in so in case you can't read them I'm gonna read them out quickly so we have next at latest and then react at latest and react on at latest so let's hit enter and see what happens whoa actually hold on a second let's take this out of here let's go to a different branch and then hit enter that's weird let's get out of here get checkout and then do the B flag which I believe this will create the branch and put me on that branch at the same time which is always useful so you don't accidentally start committing things to the branch that you're on like master not realizing that you didn't move to the other branch which happens it's happened to me before okay so this is close branch next five awesome so now we have a new branch it's called next five and oops you decide yarn and there we are now let's hit enter and see what happens cool does very quick nice all right we'll verify here in our package.json not that I don't trust that it worked but let's see so we do we have next five great it looks like react and react Dom we're already at the latest versions which is nice and anything else change I don't think so this was these parts were probably just Auto formatting or something all right cool oh it looks like the stream wasn't working no why is the stream not working alright so it's definitely not like the CPU I'm not getting the fans running let me try I'm gonna try to plug in the ethernet cable I think I get faster speeds for the ethernet I that at least that's what I've been told I never really tested it out but I unplugged it because I can't migrate data over the ethernet cord for whatever reason now I can't find it I lost my Ethernet I'm have to stand up and cover the camera here so hold on all right hopefully that will help no I'm seeing drop down to nothing all right now we're back up maybe it just dropped down to nothing because it was switching over hopefully we'll be good all right okay cool so now let's just see what's happening with this now that we've upgraded let me find where I have this running there so have it up here I've lost it there it is okay so here's our app and I was on this page which didn't work before so I'm not worried about that but let's check the homepage and let's get our console up so we can see errors all right not bad not bad that works now let's try some routes all right faculty awesome that works let me restart the server as well just to be sure because with a with an update like that I like to do like a manual restart just to be sure let's refresh there we are okay there's some errors here so a free Actos server cool all right let me go back to the home page interesting all right so even our home page isn't working so let's try this out one thing we could do is go back to the documentation first that might not be a bad idea so let's go here and see what we might need to change all right I'm going pretty quickly through this so maybe missing something but it didn't seem like there was anything that said hey you need to change this for this to work okay let's see Harshit says try reinstalling react dom yeah we could reinstall that I mean we were trying to update that at the same time and let's see yeah I seen on the live chat so vibe vibe have really wants me to answer a question so just hold on I'm gonna do questions in about ten minutes okay we could yeah let's do Rex could not resolve react on server in node modules reactive hallo hey here's Alicia do why not do this the old RM RF node modules and then just reinstall maybe maybe it'll work and maybe it'll save a lot of time so let's do that if you never use this before sometimes it can fix all your problems you don't necessarily know what the problem was but it does fix it so let's try it RM RF oh wait okay our says you found he found the air okay alright node modules your life has been spared from now it's in the babble RC all right let's check it out I guess I could turn on where we have a concern on Angra so you all can see the errors as well I'm gonna pace this over so you can click on the link I just paste it in the live chat and then you can have beautiful errors right on your screen just like I do alright well let's take a look then for a second here at our babble or si all right so it says try commenting out the module resolvers stuff so we can probably call them out coming out everything here right or actually just this right we can't comment out in JSON so let me just remove it then all right let me restart the server just to be sure cool all right that worked let's check out some other pages nope all right so this isn't working probably because we're actually using some graph QL stuff here but this is a different error than we had before so I think this error was caused by us removing all that stuff about plugins so I'm going to put this back in and see what Wow well you see what we can do so evidently we need this part for all of our our pages to work except the home page so we can't just take it out it's so hard who's probably the one that made this file in the first place is saying remove the dollar sign so I will try that hey there we go it works let's try a different page film study No let's try another one I'm not 100% sure that that route worked anyway all right yeah it must be shoot why did that other page work I don't know why it works for a minute oh all right so I should say and restart yeah so we didn't restart yeah let's let's try that I didn't restart because it looked like it worked automatically so let's give it a shot here nope still there's I'm gonna get out of this view so I can zoom in a bit more ever so i'll ReactOS okay i'm gonna remove hard should say and remove the this little guy sorry about that hard I wasn't paying attention in the live chat okay no let's restart it mmm all right so let me check my timer all right we got about two minutes left and then I'll go back to the live chat and I answer some questions but it's saying the dependency was not found I'm thinking it still might be worth it to do our MRF and reload everything not really a big deal for me I've got lots of bandwidth all right so I've just deleted all my node modules please don't run RM RF if you're not a hundred percent sure you want everything deleted in that particular folder because it will be deleted forever you won't be able to get it back but I can get all my node modules back just by typing yarn so that's what I'm gonna do and the timer should be going off very soon so let's see I don't think we're gonna get anything else done 30 seconds oh cool it finished I don't think it finished fast enough let's restart this dependency not found hmm all right well that's it for that session so let me take a 5minute break I'm gonna go back to the live chat if anybody has any ideas for how we can fix this error that we're getting please put it in the live chat now I'll come back to it we'll give it another shot after the five minutes are up also it's really hot in my office so I'm going to take my sweater off see Gander says anyone else going to watch the SpaceX heavy Falcon launch as well maybe I don't know what time it's on the anybody know what time it's on for Eastern Time don't worry about if you don't know I won't take me that long to look it up but it might be cool to watch with my kids later on as long as it's not too late old so I says hello everyone hey how's it going thanks for watching and I miss everyone I don't know about you I don't have anybody missed me but now that I'm talking with you oh and everything I did I miss I miss y'all I tell you what it's really really easy for me when I come in to just be lazy and say like I'm not gonna stream today you know I gotta you know get the thumbnail ready for the video put the info and schedule the stream you know and it's not really that much all that can be done in less than 20 minutes you know probably less than 15 but sometimes it's easy for me to be lazy and not stream like yesterday probably could have squeezed one in but it's like oh well if it's not the right conditions let's just not do it but once I'm actually here with you all I really love it so anyway just wanted to tell you how much I appreciate you she AB ass please give me a complete guideline to be a developer I'm not sure I can give you a complete guideline and in the time that we have right now but I would say as a rough kind of outline learn HTML and CSS probably learn things in this order if you want to be a frontend developer or even a fullstack developer learn things and do it in this order HTML CSS basics right you don't need to get too indepth then go into JavaScript it's probably not a bad idea to learn a little bit of jQuery it's it can get your confidence up and realistically you'll probably be able to find a lot of jobs that require jQuery so depending on what your circumstances are it might be beneficial to you otherwise just stick with JavaScript and start building things if you want to be full stack and moving to backend then learn node that'll be the easiest jump for you to make from javis like clientside JavaScript to get into the backend and then you'll probably want to learn a little bit more about api's and databases and things if you want to just stick with frontend though stick with your JavaScript and then if you want to check out something like angular or react or view to help help you out you'll go with that if you want to be able to follow on with these streams definitely check out react and it probably couldn't hurt to check out some sort of UI framework like material UI fusing react or materialized CSS or bootstrap or foundation or something like that depending on how much you like the design CSS side of things if you really like doing it yourself then maybe you don't want to use a framework but in any case it is it's good to at least be knowledgeable of those frameworks and how things are done in them because those are like common design patterns the users are familiar with so even if you don't want to use them I still think it's it's a good idea to be familiar with them so anyway that's like kind of my just outline of what to learn if you want to ask me know maybe I'll do a video of more indepth stuff if anyone's interested in that let me know would you like me to do a video or a series of videos outlining a good plan for what to learn and when to become a developer if you like it just leave some in the live chat leave something in the comments of the video or something like that and then if enough of you are interested then I'll kind of make more of an effort to to do that also I says maybe in short streams you could do question and answer actually that's not a bad idea if I'm doing a short one maybe I'll just say like hey this is just a cute I stream yeah yeah cuz it is kind of difficult to get much work done and just like a half an hour but question answer would be pretty easy that's a pretty good idea thanks Brooke says about the routing I'm sure that code can be rewritten about half the lines while being clearer and more performant Oh Nicki don't I I know I already told you in the the comments to that PR but I think it was genius I mean it was really good is the only thing I had to change and I we can talk more about it is routes that weren't included in that that object where we're actually bringing up an error so I just had to put a change it up just a little bit to make sure that those routes actually did end up going to the universal route but other than that it was was great all right let's get back to the code and let me write down where I'm leaving off Yeah right and if anybody's interested in doing some refactoring with that you know hey you know feel free to take a shot at it you know as long as the functionality remains the same and it's still readable that would be awesome let's see here we go okay I'm gonna check the bottom of the live chat quickly to see if anyone had any more ideas about Harsin it looks like Harshit made a pull request I didn't even merge this it's already made a pull request let's check it out all right let's go to github and once I get in here I will make it bigger there we are and best feather okay cool so let's check out the file first so we can see so harsh it has put in roots source no way that's awesome so that was the only thing to change all right hard do you want to get credit for this pull request I will merge it in or do you want me to just copy and paste this let me know I'm more than happy to give you credit and actually merge this pull request see our she says just copy and paste okay that's cool urgent says I made this as you might have forgot the carrots hole file why do I need to do the whole file it just changed one thing hold on a second modules over alias okay so right above alias I know you thought you thought I was gonna forget all the stuff that I change right but that controlz is my friend all right hey well at least we got a fresh new node modules folder right so restarting hmm it's not working for me yes that will check I'm gonna pull over harsh it's code on my other screen so I can compare exactly what it was okay so it is exactly the same I mean the formatting is a little different but oh yeah still same air same thing okay hmm michael says is react Apollo even in node modules I I would imagine it would be let's check it out don't need it at blank file there what's this this is some cool stuff I'll have to share that with you soon I thought I already had it open I guess not there's my package.json there we are that's a good thought though Michael it's worth checking it out Apollo yep yep react Apollo here modules can't resolve react on server in we react Apollo we could dive into node module and here see what's going on here's the thing I don't get I like really we didn't change react Dom we didn't change react Apollo that's what we're getting the air from react on server and react Apollo that kind of bothers me I would get another arrow down here I know it's hard to see yeah this was sure fine it's never modules tab who lives have Jess okay arch says try removing what is that called the caret sign and the dollar sign after this all right let's give that a shot my Babel save dad no same thing all right so let's change that back I don't like to you know so this is what that that file is looking for react om server so react Apollo somewhere it's searching for react on server alright it looks like this dream cut out but now it's back alright sorry about the stream I just I don't know what's going on with it today I haven't changed anything about OBS settings I don't know okay so harsh is saying remove the cache from the node modules which I did not do before so let's do RM RF node modules slash cache and the next one why is it not found of course it's there maybe it's just something with the copying area that's weird so Microsoft Outlook is giving me a notification right now for a meeting that was cancelled it even tells me cancelled and it's not I was telling me I have 11 minutes to get this meeting with that seems like it's something it should not be doing see all right so say that wasn't it as well yeah same error and you know raluchi she was the ADA okay so saying that's odd all right so yes I don't you'll see that when I mouse over doesn't that look like an odd path yes all right so in react Dom or server digest is just this we also have I mean the only thing I can see is that react Apollo is once a an older version of react Dom I mean again that just it doesn't make that much sense because let's sit this no I Donnie Eric for working with Saddam down here it has a different version hmm all right let me let me go with the left has to go saying Michael is saying why not just reinstall react Dom server like the message says I mean well I mean technically we just reinstalled everything right when we removed all our node modules see it looks like someone else had a similar problem with a previous version of next so there's an issue a closed issue on next J s repo trying to scroll down to see what what happened with that yes I kind of thought we'd have errors I just thought I would have a little bit easier time getting through it alright so I'm going to paste in the to live chat the issue that I'm seeing right now in case anyone else is interested and then I'll pull it over onto the screen so you can see you can see what I'm looking at right now so I was a little skeptical because this issue was from June of 2017 so I figured like an issue that old has probably already been taken care of but it looks like it maybe wasn't so even after the issue was closed we have the issue still happening oh this is still happening in beta version of next mmhmm in this case if the app is built everything works but in development it doesn't work all right so there is a fix Oh Gander has to go hey again or thanks for joining us I'll see you later John Hanson says I saw some stuff on the web similar issue NPM babble plugin module was over and create an alias module resolver for reacts Apollo in Belvoir see mmhmm I'm just not finding really new issues I'd rather have something newer but I mean I guess potentially if this issue just happened again with this release then there's there's not gonna be a lot oh wow almost to the end of another 25minute session here really glad I did this in a separate branch I think it's a really really long shot that this will works and so much has changed since this version of next but I think it's worth a shot let's see yingying ye so I'm not sure how to pronounce your name so why ing j IE please let me know how to pronounce it I'd love to pronounce it correctly for you but anyway it says there's no super chat here now I haven't done the super chat at all is there an advantage to doing the super chat if so let me know alright let me make this file really quickly just to see if it works and then I'll go back and go through everything the live chat so it's saying do this and where that's it's closed up these node modules modules close this ooh if you you know what this isn't gonna work this person's issue also I had to do with change effectuation of different sized shoes and it also had to do with type scripts hmm oh okay so it seems like super with super chat you can make so you can get donations that's pretty cool I'm not gonna start doing it for free code camp stream unless that's what Quincy wants so right now I'm not gonna use it but I'll definitely keep that in mind that's that's pretty interesting all right her shirt says he's got it so I'm gonna wait for more on that from Harshit and in the meantime I'm gonna go up to latch at where I left off and I'm gonna answer some questions Nietzsche says Oh wowthat's today bleedingedge stuff right here yeah it just came out I actually thank Harshad for hearts just sent me a message was it a message no I think it was an issue I should open an issue on this repo saying that next five came out so I saw that check it out this morning if the holidays maybe this would be cool for a stream let's see on Hill says hi hey how's it going son bassist Jesse the hacker in which company do you work right now I work for a small University called Franciscan University of stupid about five of us there are so many frameworks of JavaScript like react angular of UJS ember meteor etc we have to learn all of them to become a good developer oh no way no way you don't have to learn all of them you could be a good developer no none of them and just use JavaScript or you could just learn one of them and be really good in fact I would think if you knew all of them you probably wouldn't be really good at any of them usually take specialization to become really good so yeah don't worry about that you don't I mean it'd be good to know a little bit about each one just so that you can accurately assess whether which one would be best for a particular project that you you're about to work on but don't you certainly don't have to really learn every one of them and it says hey hey how's it going glad you could make it for the latch at Gander has said the RM RF node modules doesn't fix as much as it used to since NPM selfclean since version 5 all right good to know good to know maybe I won't be so quick to try it next time then again just said the SpaceX launch is actually going on like right now liftoff is at 220 Eastern Time alright cool well I'm gonna try to end the stream before then so y'all can watch the launch if you want to I'm high school Creole said I thought you just had a hangover from watching the Superbowl not actually I didn't even watch the Super Bowl this year I just watched like a kids movie with with my kids and went to sleep I'm actually a Pittsburgh Steelers fan and they weren't in it and just wasn't that into it this year James says Jessie beard is looking awesome this beard is looking awesome bro I appreciate it thank you it is getting a little long and you can't thankfully you can't tell on the camera at least I can't tell from seeing OBS but it's starting to get a little gray I got some gray hairs right here on the chin my wife laughs when she sees that so I don't know we'll see how it looks once the stars turned gray maybe I'll look better who knows I'll look more distinguished right with gray divya says it's completely offtopic but do people use react with django apps i have never heard of anyone usually react with django but i mean that that it certainly people could be doing it i just don't know about it i don't know much at all about django I've never used it so i'm i probably can't give you a good answer has anyone else heard of anything like that allen word says thumbs up for the video on getting started and motivation on day 21 of 100 days of code and life got in the way and had to take a week off now it's hard to get started again thanks for everything you rock I really appreciate you telling me that and I'm glad that you liked the video hopefully it's helping you out maybe I'll have to I'll have to make another one here because I've added in some things into my daily routine that have really helped since I made that video and I think it could be helpful for some people so maybe I have to make a part 2 or something along those lines yeah but I appreciate you telling me that when I get feedback like that then I mean it's good because I know what what kind of content is helpful for people Aleksey says hey hey how's it going world's us why didn't you just leave next yes version 4 we certainly could have left next version 4 version 5 did have some improvements that I liked so it was easier to integrate sass the build speed was faster so I don't know did we have to probably not but it I mean while we're still developing it it's a heck of a lot easier I think now before everything's are all built out to update like this that way if we do have problems there's just less code to look through to try to find the problem I mean if we really can't figure this out we can always just flip back to the master branch and come back and try again at some another time but I still have a lot of data in my grade so I don't really need to work on this repo you know right away so we'll see I it's worth giving it a little bit more time all right it just automatically popped me back down to the bottom of the live chat and I see that Harshit is typing in all caps which means that he's got something for me oh you know I had to leave so it was too late here I gotta go to sleep all right well good night Anna thanks for joining us let's see see this got it we're gonna see this oh I should says do the work around in there so hard were you talking about that workaround that I was just going to make so like this in the issues okay oh I should that's a good point arch it says remember to back up the WordPress install because it could set me back that is very very good point I'll shoot I know I did that because this was supposed to be typescript now this type shift even gonna work for me in here will automatically work with next five or you have to set that up I guess we'll find out really soon we had a flash of content yeah remove that show all right remove the any okay the suppose I could take the typescript off of here now all right so we still have some stuff going on suspected digit because of you syntax error number all right we got some syntax errors stuff going on here but we it worked let's try some other pages now I'm not happy yet because I'm I'm like waiting to see if something else breaks I'm not convinced yet all right now I'm pretty convinced all right all right cool now I can smile and be happy cool all right so this was pretty cool hopefully this will be helpful for anybody who's trying to upgrade now I guess not everybody's gonna have the same configuration that we had so it probably won't happen for a lot of people I don't know but here was the deal right so we upgraded and we ended up having to add next dot config dot J s file ok just down here in our main folder right and we had to put module exports and looks this deletes some aliases so this is what we had to put in there alright now this will be in the repo soon once I push this so you can you know copy and paste this use this file if you need to for what you're doing and hopefully it'll help you cool Oh Nikki's Nikki's computer crashed basically because of the same error and so Nikki missed the fix so this is the fix this right here so I'll I'll push this let's push this now do you think we're safe enough now to merge this into master hmm what are you what would we call a commit that's just updating packages there are dependencies michael says don't merge it yet alright well I'll just keep it on this branch for now all right so we're just gonna say this is build I mean really the the the piece of this that we could most immediately benefit from anyway is that we'll have faster build time so that kind of makes sense oops I should saying it's a chore so we should say put it under chore all right all right thanks up are there any breaking changes there were we fixed them yes it does affect any an open issue what issue is that let's see I don't remember what issue of us have to look it up seventyfive uh you know we have to pass all the tests did we pass yay all right all right cool so we do have a branch in our github repo now that is for next five so if you want to see any of the stuff that we just did today check out that next five branch we're not gonna merge it yet Michael I think as has the right idea here is not to merge it yet double check make sure things work give it a little bit more time to test then we can merge it when we're when we're sure all right cool let me try to get through the rest of the questions in the live chat and no I said I'd try to be done before the rocket launch sorry about that totally understand if you were watching this and watch the launch I'll still go through and answer the questions though all right let's see you know what I don't think I marked where I left off I just have to read some of it Niq alright I see now where Nicky said that the lab saw the blue screen of death out of the blue on this last hub nick says this looks hard I learned PHP well PHP looks hard to me so that's yes it just depends on what you're more used to working with Oh harsh it says the Instagram uses Django with react well that's that's a really big example thank you for bringing that up Lexi says can you run react alongside with express in next Jas yeah that's we have let me show you my server the server JS file here yeah so we've got Express running we have next running obviously react so it's all it's all running together nick says where can I learn about cyber security for free thanks for your apply I don't know for sure I've not taken cyber security curse courses well I think that but I did do some of the course on Udacity so I believe Udacity has some courses or at least one course on cyber security that you can take for free I imagine there are a lot of courses on on udemy that probably aren't free so I would check out the one for Udacity from what I remember of it it was actually taught by some people who are really kind of like big names in the field of cyber security they have literally written you know the authoritative books on cybersecurity so check that out first I'd say that's probably a good place to start also says while you're doing your project are you concerned about security website like CSRF attacks equal Jacksons or that is not a possibility a frontend developer or at least Fernandez should know these this stuff yeah so we definitely try to keep that stuff in mind for just purely frontend stuff it's there are different things to be concerned about but you know potentially by using so this is where I see the big advantage of using established like premade things as as opposed to creating everything on our own you build things from scratch they just haven't been tested but if we're using things that that have been tested like for instance wordpress order managing content through wordpress very well none frequently updated mostly updates a lot of the updates have security updates in them as well so we don't have to purse like act like know all the different threats out there as long as we have a reliable you know maintainer so the people who maintain wordpress are pretty on top of things one of the biggest threats for WordPress is plugins that are out of date so in terms of plugins I'm very careful about what I install and what I use and if it's a plugin that doesn't seem like it will be updated or it's no longer maintained I make sure I take a look at the code you know as best as I can with my limited knowledge of PHP and and try to really understand what's happening so yeah so I guess I say I'm worried about it that's one of the reasons why I think upgrading plugins and things is important especially if you become aware that there's a security issue I do have some people in the computer science department and that are interested in doing some penetration testing so hopefully we can get that set up and working and you know so people that are more knowledgeable about security than I am can really kind of check things out and make recommendations okay I'm gonna have to go pretty quick and wrap this up so I just got a message that the head of the department needs to meet with me because and it may have to do with this website so definitely don't want to keep her waiting I know says this project is getting good that is nice see they keep pushing okay michael says they keep pushing to launch back now it's a 90 minutes okay well at least we didn't miss it okay I got to the end of the live chat sorry I'm have to just cut it off right there so maybe join us for another chat if you have some more questions thank you so much for all the help and working through these issues thankfully we you know we got it all working but I really appreciate all the help and I should be back tomorrow until then have a great day
