00:00 - this week i've been practicing more my
00:02 - design muscles
00:04 - [Music]
00:17 - [Music]
00:23 - my
00:26 - [Music]
00:49 - do
00:54 - [Music]
01:00 - [Music]
01:02 - it's monday 7pm i've just gathered five
01:04 - brownie points and i'm missing six to my
01:07 - 500 browning challenge majority day of
01:10 - today was preoccupied with my design
01:12 - project that i have just started
01:14 - from learning and my challenges i took
01:18 - part in helping people on guitar and i'm
01:22 - going running right now using the rest
01:24 - of sun from today
01:25 - [Music]
01:44 - it's tuesday and the second day i have
01:47 - been working on the design of the new
01:49 - project
01:51 - the biggest problem that i face is a
01:54 - lack of self-confidence
01:56 - so i'm learning right now
02:00 - how to
02:02 - how to sell
02:04 - the the projects i do the designs i do
02:07 - and also how to believe in in you know
02:10 - in yourself it's a bit hard especially
02:12 - when
02:13 - you cannot show the projects to
02:16 - you know all over the world because they
02:18 - are not your projects and sometimes
02:20 - you have to keep them for yourself and
02:22 - for your clients only
02:25 - believing that you are good at what you
02:26 - do
02:28 - pretty hard because you know that you
02:30 - always can be better
02:40 - i'm trying to build my self-confidence
02:42 - the work that we are doing as designers
02:45 - or developers is just
02:46 - you know some person of the final
02:48 - product and the rest is selling and
02:52 - telling the story about it and explain
02:54 - why we chose this way not the other way
02:56 - so you have to rely on
02:58 - what you think before you deliver to the
03:00 - client and later you can
03:02 - iterate over it
03:04 - [Music]
03:17 - ladies and gentlemen it's wednesday and
03:20 - i'm missing one brownie point to my 500
03:23 - brownie challenge so
03:25 - it's pretty exciting
03:27 - [Music]
03:47 - [Music]
03:52 - yeah
03:54 - i
03:55 - i made it i got a 500 brownie points
04:00 - during these three days i
04:01 - gathered the missing points and i just
04:04 - completed my challenge
04:05 - my challenge was to reach 500 brownie
04:07 - points before going to the next level
04:09 - that in my case is data visualization
04:11 - certification my last brownie point was
04:15 - gathered
04:17 - well in javascript room so help
04:19 - javascript maybe it's a sign to start
04:22 - being more present than
04:30 - myself
04:34 - [Music]
04:43 - down
04:45 - [Music]
05:47 - down
05:51 - [Music]
05:59 - it's friday yesterday in the evening i
06:03 - set
06:03 - my brackets
06:06 - to work in sas brackets has nice
06:09 - extensions and you can write themselves
06:11 - and later you'll get uh your assassin's
06:14 - css that's great because the code editor
06:18 - makes majority of stuff for me it's
06:20 - enough to set the json file
06:23 - and
06:24 - remember about it in each project you
06:26 - use sauce
06:27 - i have less and less time right now for
06:30 - my company that's cooking so i prefer
06:31 - myself a whack good coffee
06:34 - and a treat it's dark chocolate with
06:36 - fruit
06:40 - let's get back to work i have to finish
06:42 - right now the empty states and the
06:44 - design
06:46 - that i'm working on and i will also have
06:49 - to
06:50 - connect uh the the screens into
06:52 - prototype
06:53 - majority of this week i spend an
06:54 - experience design and just a little bit
06:56 - of time in the code editor that's the
06:59 - week mostly devoted to design because
07:00 - i'm working on a new project i got
07:02 - another graphic designer
07:05 - i learned
07:06 - at the same time code so how to
07:08 - implement my solutions
07:10 - and
07:11 - design so knowing at least a bit of ux
07:15 - always helps somebody asked in the
07:17 - comments how i do the projects from
07:19 - scratch i start with designs
07:22 - what i mean by starting with designs is
07:24 - starting firstly with the users and the
07:26 - goal
07:27 - so analyzing who is it for and how this
07:31 - product that will be designed and
07:32 - implemented in code how does it solve
07:36 - their problems you have to put yourself
07:38 - as if in user's shoes and think
07:42 - what would i want to do right now
07:45 - where would i like to go from this point
07:48 - to the other one what would be the other
07:50 - point what i'm what am i looking for in
07:53 - this particular page
07:55 - user journeys
07:57 - and imagining
07:59 - like from which screen would i go to
08:01 - which one
08:03 - it's really important not to forget
08:06 - about something when i do the designs
08:08 - forum for my projects very often as i
08:11 - showed in some of the videos
08:13 - i finished at something like that
08:18 - which is a kind of uh
08:20 - of sketch right the truth is that if i
08:23 - implement it and it's my side project
08:26 - and it's really small project
08:28 - like kind of website or small app i
08:32 - didn't need
08:34 - high fidelity prototypes because
08:37 - i was also implementing it
08:39 - but when i do it for the clients
08:42 - i go to the tools such as experience
08:44 - design or protio i will provide all of
08:47 - the links
08:48 - in the video description below
08:52 - so there are various ways of learning ux
08:54 - by chance one of them
08:56 - is following the twitter accounts and
08:58 - you know just only looking at what's uh
09:01 - what's interesting for you uh there are
09:03 - awesome um there are some places uh and
09:07 - people to follow our organizations one
09:10 - of them is
09:11 - neil's norman group they published a
09:13 - great report very interesting ones
09:16 - great resource for those who are
09:19 - interested is also luke vublavsky and
09:21 - he's really really great guy on when it
09:24 - comes to giving the talks and
09:28 - being a
09:29 - user advocate at his side you will find
09:32 - a lot of awesome articles presentations
09:35 - and you will also
09:37 - find a lot of
09:38 - great talks that he gave and
09:42 - at youtube
09:43 - so you can look at youtube another great
09:46 - source of ux knowledge is for example
09:48 - medium
09:49 - so i follow for example ux planet and
09:53 - there are great articles i love
09:55 - especially those written by this guy so
09:58 - nick is really
10:00 - great
10:01 - when it comes to examples and providing
10:05 - meaningful explanations
10:07 - at ux
10:09 - panel that is another type 2
10:11 - you'll find a lot a lot of free ebooks
10:16 - and um
10:18 - this is also knowledge that is like as
10:21 - if compensated in one place blister part
10:24 - um another very famous uh
10:27 - place to look for great articles
10:29 - i know that there are some developers
10:31 - who say i'm a developer i'm not a
10:34 - designer so i don't you know give a
10:37 - about this stuff about design because
10:38 - it's not my thing and in that team there
10:40 - will be people responsible for ui and
10:44 - you know i will not have to do it uh
10:47 - i'm not the kind of person like that so
10:49 - i want to also get to know um
10:52 - some at least basics from the design and
10:56 - the usability and accessibility stuff
10:59 - you don't have to be experienced
11:00 - designer you don't have to be a graphic
11:02 - designer but you can make your projects
11:05 - stand out by knowing these few simple
11:08 - rules
11:10 - start with a user and their goals so
11:12 - start with the audience and who will be
11:14 - really using this product
11:16 - take care about visual hierarchy make
11:19 - sure your text your content is readable
11:23 - make sure that something that needs
11:25 - needs to stand out stands out
11:28 - provide just in time feedback try to
11:30 - make your navigation intuitive and call
11:33 - to actions at the right place in the
11:35 - right moment i also focus on being
11:36 - consistent so if i use for example the
11:40 - action color that is like
11:42 - mint green i will always use this main
11:44 - thing
11:45 - for the
11:46 - action provide just in time information
11:49 - so do not provide long tutorials before
11:52 - the user even starts using the product
11:54 - make users feel secure and sure so
11:57 - explain what's needed and do not require
11:59 - too much another pretty crucial thing is
12:02 - to make it responsive so start mobile
12:04 - first it will be easier for you to
12:05 - design uh the project for your desktop
12:08 - version because on mobile you have less
12:10 - screen and as a result if you have
12:13 - suddenly more of the screen it would be
12:15 - easier to fit to fit the elements in
12:18 - test test test so test with users tests
12:21 - on various devices test in various
12:23 - browsers
12:24 - remember about empty states so the
12:26 - situation when a user uh comes into your
12:29 - app for the first time and you know
12:31 - there's no data provided if you want to
12:33 - improve your projects
12:35 - and besides learning to code you also
12:37 - want to get to know
12:38 - at least a bit about user experience
12:40 - design i recommend to start with this
12:42 - book that is don't make me think
12:44 - and generate this offer because uh it's
12:46 - really a great book when it comes to
12:50 - the basics of the basics
12:53 - this week i was mostly working on the
12:55 - clients project and it was a design
12:57 - project so i was uh practicing my skills
13:00 - and experience design this week i have
13:03 - also reached another milestone that is
13:05 - 500 brownie points in the freakout camp
13:08 - community
13:09 - and this way i opened myself the way to
13:11 - the next challenges there i also
13:14 - prepared brackets for
13:16 - working with sas
13:18 - and i created the wrapper for the new
13:20 - project
13:21 - the biggest problem of this week was
13:22 - self-confidence
13:25 - next week i will be implementing finally
13:27 - implementing my um
13:29 - about portfolio page and i will be using
13:32 - flexbox sas keep on doing learn at least
13:35 - a bit about design especially user
13:38 - experience design and see you next week
13:46 - [Music]
13:48 - you
