00:00 - in this video i'll be introducing the
00:02 - very last algebraic law of sets known as
00:04 - de morgan's law de morgan's law was
00:07 - founded by augustus de morgan and it
00:09 - states that the complement of a union
00:13 - is the intersection of the complements
00:16 - or it says that the complement of the
00:19 - intersection is the union of the
00:21 - complements so we're going to prove that
00:23 - the complement of
00:25 - the union of a and b
00:27 - is
00:28 - the in is in fact equal to
00:31 - the
00:32 - uh complement of a intersected with the
00:35 - complement of b so to do this we have to
00:37 - show that uh the complement of a union b
00:39 - is a subset of a complement intersection
00:41 - b complement and vice versa so let's get
00:44 - started uh suppose that x is an element
00:48 - of a union b complement
00:50 - if that's the case then by definition x
00:52 - is not an element of a union b
00:55 - and if x is not an element of a union b
00:57 - that is if x is not an element of the
01:00 - region a union b which is the red here
01:03 - then surely x is not an element of a
01:06 - and x is not an element of b and if
01:08 - that's the case then by definition x is
01:11 - not an element of a complement and x is
01:13 - not an element of b complement
01:15 - therefore x is not
01:18 - an element of a complement intersection
01:20 - b complement
01:21 - so if we go to the other side here
01:24 - we start by saying let's let's suppose
01:26 - that x is an element of a complement
01:28 - intersection b complement
01:30 - then by definition x is an element of a
01:33 - complement and x is element of b
01:35 - complement by definition of the
01:37 - complements x is not an element of a and
01:40 - x is not an element of b
01:42 - and
01:43 - with the same logic x is not an element
01:46 - of
01:46 - a union b
01:48 - because x is not an element of this
01:50 - region and x is not an element of this
01:52 - region so surely it's not an element of
01:55 - the two regions combined
01:57 - and by definition of complements x is an
02:00 - element of a union b complement
