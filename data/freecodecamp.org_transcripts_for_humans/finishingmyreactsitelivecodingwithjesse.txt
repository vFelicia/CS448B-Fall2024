00:08 - hey everyone it's Jessie and today is
00:12 - the last day that I will be working on
00:17 - this project so so far for all of my
00:21 - streams for free code camp I've been
00:23 - working on this one project this react
00:27 - site and today's the last day so I'm
00:31 - really excited I'm excited to move on to
00:34 - my next project I'm not actually
00:36 - entirely sure what my next project will
00:39 - be there's a couple of different options
00:41 - my boss is still on his honeymoon I
00:44 - think he gets back today
00:46 - she might be um by now I'm not sure but
00:49 - he'll be in tomorrow and then we'll
00:52 - we'll decide together what my next
00:54 - project will be but there's a good
00:55 - chance it'll be another react another
00:59 - react site so before I get started today
01:05 - I just want to give a birthday shout out
01:08 - to a friend of mine
01:13 - Zach Levin Dorf who's I hope he doesn't
01:16 - mind me giving this shout out like this
01:18 - but I just wanted to mention him on on
01:21 - this stream because if it wasn't for him
01:23 - I probably would not be here doing this
01:25 - stream like I wouldn't be a developer at
01:27 - all so I don't know maybe five years ago
01:33 - or so something like like that I really
01:37 - needed a job and I was about to take a
01:39 - job that I didn't even really want to do
01:41 - but it was just going to be something to
01:43 - pay the bills and he offered me a job
01:49 - doing basically subcontracting work for
01:52 - him and he had like a media marketing
01:55 - company and
01:57 - he I had known him before and I had
02:01 - known his family so he knew that I was a
02:04 - decent guy and so he gave me a chance
02:06 - even though I hadn't built any websites
02:08 - for a really long time
02:11 - and he actually would would tell me like
02:15 - hey I'll pay you for so many hours just
02:17 - go learn how to do this and I'll pay you
02:18 - for it which was really cool because I
02:22 - really you know I had a few kids at the
02:24 - time and I really needed the money and I
02:27 - didn't have a lot of a lot of time to go
02:30 - and learn on my own I needed to be
02:32 - working so that really helped so for a
02:35 - few years I did a lot of work with him
02:37 - and anyway so I'm not sure if he's gonna
02:41 - watch or not I told him I was gonna give
02:42 - him a shout-out so I just wanted to to
02:46 - tell him happy birthday and just let
02:50 - everybody know how important it is he
02:51 - was kind of like a mentor to me at a
02:54 - time when I was just starting out and
02:55 - not really sure what I wanted to do so
02:58 - if you have a chance to do something
03:00 - like that for someone definitely do that
03:09 - it doesn't have to be I guess like an
03:11 - official mentor like you know he he
03:14 - wasn't my mentor officially Wicker we
03:16 - worked together but he taught me a lot
03:19 - about freelancing in general you know
03:21 - how to handle clients and contracts and
03:23 - billing and you know a lot of things
03:25 - like that a lot about WordPress and
03:28 - about search engine optimization and and
03:33 - he was he's a really good designer as
03:36 - well so he taught me a lot about design
03:37 - and yes that was that was cool we had we
03:43 - spent we spent a lot of time we would
03:46 - just stay up all night and work on build
03:48 - websites and those were some of the best
03:52 - learning experiences you know because we
03:55 - would take a break and get something to
03:56 - eat
03:56 - and just and talk for awhile in between
04:01 - coding sessions and that was really
04:03 - important for me when I was just
04:05 - starting out so if you ever have a
04:06 - chance to do that with somebody that's
04:08 - just starting out
04:09 - it'll definitely make a big difference
04:11 - to them it might not might not be that
04:13 - big of a deal to you it might not be
04:15 - that hard for you to do but it can make
04:17 - a big impact on someone so I hope that I
04:21 - can have that same impact on somebody
04:23 - one day and kind of pay it forward but
04:29 - I'm gonna check the live chat yeah
04:31 - actually
04:32 - Patrick is asking what happened to the
04:34 - viewer count yeah this is really weird
04:39 - so usually at the beginning of the
04:42 - streams the analytics there's some lag
04:46 - time or something so it shows like zero
04:47 - viewers for a minute or so but actually
04:50 - this is really this is really odd
04:53 - because it's showing three viewers and
04:55 - it should have already refreshed so
05:00 - anyway yeah Patrick I don't know what
05:02 - happened the last time something like
05:04 - this happened I didn't realize it but I
05:07 - think I was streaming during like
05:08 - Facebook's livestream of of one of their
05:12 - conferences so maybe maybe there's
05:19 - something happening that I'm missing I
05:21 - don't really know but I did let me
05:27 - double check I usually put the link on
05:31 - on Twitter yeah I did at 2:00 p.m.
05:34 - Eastern time I put the link on Twitter I
05:39 - put the right time okay did everything I
05:46 - the the tweet has it hasn't gone out to
05:49 - that many people but yeah I did
05:55 - everything right I mean I did send it
05:56 - out you know less than an hour ago but
06:03 - yeah I don't really know what's what's
06:06 - going on but it's fine with me I still
06:09 - need to do the work anyway so I mean I
06:13 - hope I didn't do anything wrong and
06:14 - people are like I hope people aren't
06:16 - getting blocked out of seeing this but
06:21 - let me I guess really quickly I'm going
06:26 - to go on another browser and try to to
06:29 - watch the stream I should be able to
06:35 - just maybe do an incognito window and
06:42 - let's see
06:53 - all right so I'm gonna go on my other
06:55 - screen I'm going to freak out camp yeah
06:57 - it does say live now free code camp I'm
07:02 - gonna try to click it okay cool I was
07:07 - able to get in and watch so but it does
07:09 - say yeah there's only six people
07:11 - watching that's crazy
07:12 - alright well anyway you know actually
07:17 - the the title that I gave the video was
07:20 - not really enticing I just said it was
07:23 - finishing my react site so maybe people
07:26 - aren't really interested in seeing me
07:29 - finish this usually I'm more a more
07:31 - descriptive title so maybe maybe that's
07:36 - why or maybe there's something else live
07:38 - that's really important I mean did
07:40 - something crazy happen on the news and
07:42 - I'm just not aware of it I don't know
07:45 - anyway I'm gonna go ahead and get
07:47 - started
07:49 - so as the title says I am just trying to
07:53 - finish up the site today so I'm gonna
07:56 - show you here's my Trello board and the
07:59 - link to this is in the description so in
08:00 - case you really do want to check out the
08:03 - board it's it's public also like I did
08:07 - yesterday to start out with if you're
08:09 - interested in seeing my facial
08:11 - expressions as I code and seeing a
08:13 - little bit of what my office looks like
08:15 - you can check me out on on Instagram on
08:19 - my phone I'm live-streaming
08:20 - on Instagram the the view like looking
08:25 - right at my face as I as I code so the
08:31 - link to my Instagram is also in the in
08:34 - the description but as you can see right
08:37 - now I'm working on this JW player so I
08:40 - had changed from a YouTube embed and
08:43 - this was over the weekend I think I
08:45 - changed from a YouTube embed to JW
08:48 - player embed the problem was the normal
08:50 - embed that that's a script tag it loads
08:54 - the first time you load the home page
08:56 - but then after that when you use the
08:59 - client-side routing it doesn't load so
09:03 - there's there's not really anything like
09:05 - I can
09:06 - initialize it and component did mount or
09:08 - anything as far as I know I had thought
09:11 - about maybe trying to do something like
09:13 - that but I found a plugin I'm sorry like
09:21 - a react component for JW player and I
09:25 - set it up I had a little bit of trouble
09:27 - getting the right info but Sebastian is
09:30 - usually in the in the live streams
09:36 - he had mentioned like why don't I just
09:40 - check out the the actual JavaScript file
09:43 - that I was that I was pulling in from
09:47 - the normal embed and if I scroll down to
09:51 - the bottom there was a bunch of info
09:52 - there so using that info and then
09:55 - rereading the documentation on the on
09:58 - the component I was able to get it
10:01 - working the problem is it's not
10:03 - displaying like the full width of the
10:06 - screen like the other one was like I
10:08 - wanted it to so I need to figure out
10:10 - what's going on right now I'm just kind
10:13 - of comparing the CSS for the old layouts
10:17 - doing it in the new way and trying to
10:19 - match it up is exactly is it because I
10:21 - can I thought I had it messed up exactly
10:23 - but it's still not working so I'm gonna
10:25 - give it maybe just one more Pomodoro
10:29 - session and if I can't get it done then
10:32 - I'm gonna go with Plan B which is I'm
10:36 - not gonna use client-side routing for
10:39 - when people go to the home page I really
10:41 - don't want to do that because then I'm
10:43 - losing a lot of the advantages of you
10:46 - know the speed of being able to just do
10:48 - the client-side routing but I don't
10:51 - really have time right now
10:52 - to spend a whole lot of time on this and
10:55 - it it just needs to be done so that's
10:59 - the plan hopefully I can get it working
11:01 - though I really don't want to go with
11:03 - with Plan B and disable that client-side
11:07 - routing and what I mean by that is it's
11:09 - gonna actually refresh the page and so
11:11 - that way the video will play again
11:13 - because it'll have a full page refresh
11:17 - and as you
11:19 - can see I have basically this is it this
11:21 - is all that really needs done and
11:23 - actually everything on this list doesn't
11:25 - absolutely need to be done so some of
11:27 - the things I just really want to get
11:29 - done like we had the geolocation to sort
11:31 - events by distance this was never
11:33 - something that was asked for on the site
11:36 - this was just something that I thought
11:38 - was a really obvious feature that should
11:40 - be on the site so if I can't get to this
11:42 - this art the geolocation already works I
11:44 - just need to have some indication in the
11:47 - user interface that you can do that
11:49 - because right now there's there's no
11:51 - indication at all that you can click on
11:54 - distance and sort by distance so I'm
11:59 - sorry click on location and sort by
12:00 - distance in the same way with the tables
12:04 - you can sort things in the tables by
12:06 - clicking on the table headers but
12:08 - there's no indication that you can do
12:09 - that so right now it's more of like an
12:11 - easter egg on the site so if I need to I
12:15 - can put off some of these probably in a
12:18 - few months I'll be able to come back and
12:20 - work on some of these things again but
12:22 - for now probably have looks like four
12:26 - four and a half Pomodoro sessions
12:29 - according to my estimates that I should
12:32 - be able to get this done so it might
12:34 - take more or less depending on how
12:36 - accurate my estimates are and then
12:38 - that's in addition not including this
12:41 - other Pomodoro session so I'm guessing
12:43 - probably like 6:00 to probably about six
12:46 - sessions that's a 25 minutes a session
12:49 - with some breaks in between that's about
12:52 - three hours since I'll be streaming for
12:55 - a lot of that time I'm gonna say
12:56 - probably four hours of work since I
12:59 - usually have questions and things
13:01 - although if I continue to only have six
13:03 - viewers there probably won't be that
13:06 - many questions so though I could see
13:10 - Alberto is in the stream hey Alberto
13:13 - glad that you could you could join us
13:19 - okay this reminds me when I first
13:21 - started streaming and I would have is
13:23 - actually worse when I first started
13:25 - sometimes I'd be no one watching or just
13:26 - one person watching so maybe I'll get
13:30 - more done since I won't have as much
13:32 - activity in the stream I am a little bit
13:35 - nervous that like some terrible thing
13:37 - happened and everybody's watching the
13:39 - news and I don't know about it but I
13:41 - would think my co-workers would let me
13:45 - know like I'd be getting something my
13:47 - phone would be buzzing and with with
13:50 - news updates I suppose but it is a
13:53 - little weird alright so let's go with
14:00 - this oh I did want to say to my my very
14:03 - first video for free code camp now has
14:06 - over 10,000 views so it's really excited
14:08 - about that I noticed yesterday that it
14:10 - had I hadn't checked the view count in a
14:13 - long time and I noticed that I was I
14:15 - needed less than 50 views to get to
14:17 - 10,000 so I was excited so I kept kept
14:21 - watching it so this morning when I
14:22 - checked it I had I think ten thousand
14:24 - and three views so that was really cool
14:28 - so thanks everyone for for watching and
14:31 - everybody that that viewed it and it has
14:33 - a bunch of thumbs up mostly thumbs up
14:35 - not too many thumbs down so that's
14:38 - really really cool
14:41 - let's let me bring over let me start my
14:47 - my Pomodoro timer so let's pull I'll
14:51 - pull this over here and I guess here's
14:56 - what I'm going to do for right now I'm
14:58 - gonna bring over dev tools for both
15:02 - versions so on on the left hand side
15:06 - this is the new way that I'm embedding
15:09 - using the JW player react component and
15:16 - this is the older way using just this
15:18 - script tag so let me let me know if this
15:23 - font size is too small it looks a bit
15:25 - small but since I'm I don't want to make
15:28 - it too big because I need to be able to
15:30 - see both these things so just let me
15:31 - know I I could probably make it a little
15:33 - bit bigger and it'll still work but
15:36 - really what I want to do is I'm gonna
15:39 - look at this this is the first component
15:43 - that really gets
15:46 - it gets added dynamically alright so
15:50 - that's the one that I want to compare
15:52 - because everything else that's
15:53 - containing it is exactly the same
15:55 - because these are components that I have
15:57 - direct control over so let's look at
16:00 - this top level component I think this is
16:02 - all we'll have to to edit potentially
16:06 - maybe if if I get these exactly the same
16:09 - in terms of their CSS properties and it
16:11 - still doesn't work I'll have to dig down
16:13 - in farther and see that maybe some
16:16 - something down in here you know it looks
16:19 - the same right now actually I may have
16:26 - just figured it out just kind of
16:28 - inadvertently what is this JW aspect
16:37 - JW aspect all right let me check a
16:42 - little bit excited I think I may have
16:44 - just figured this out so let me all
16:47 - right so with height:auto that's what it
16:48 - needs to be let's set this to
16:51 - display:block and we need this padding
16:56 - top
17:04 - we need 50 6.25% oh man
17:11 - that works awesome let me pull this over
17:16 - really quick all right so it worked
17:18 - before I just saw nothing and ice that's
17:23 - really awesome I think I want to I want
17:28 - to see if there are some options for me
17:30 - to take take away this I don't need that
17:32 - in there and let's see what happens ok
17:34 - cool the controls come up great oh man
17:41 - what what good luck the fact I wasn't
17:45 - even gonna dig down in there and check
17:47 - it out but that was it it was the very
17:48 - first thing I looked at ok so I need to
17:53 - probably the best way to do this is just
17:55 - in my in my CSS file I'm just going to
17:59 - add this I'm gonna target this class J
18:03 - to the aspect I just want to make sure
18:04 - really quickly that that same class
18:06 - isn't used I don't see it being used
18:16 - yeah that was good okay so I think if I
18:19 - just started getting this JW aspect
18:20 - class and actually let me just I'm just
18:25 - gonna copy that I'm gonna set it to
18:28 - display:block and then I'm going to add
18:31 - this padding and that should be it that
18:34 - should fix it so I had to comment I hate
18:39 - to use important too often but I I had
18:43 - to override it cuz there's there may be
18:47 - some way for me to change that through
18:49 - the through the react component there
18:53 - probably is some way but at this point
18:56 - you know this is this will work so I'm
19:00 - just gonna go with that and the odds of
19:05 - me actually having to use this component
19:07 - and future projects are really small so
19:10 - I just don't really want to dig that
19:14 - deep into it to learn it later on if I
19:16 - need it then that's fine I'll you know
19:19 - maybe I will dig deeper but for now I
19:22 - don't want to be here all night working
19:26 - on this so let's try it out I'm gonna
19:29 - save that and then I have to do after
19:35 - you hard refresh cuz the hot like reload
19:38 - doesn't work with my stylesheet hey
19:45 - zanna's here hey how's it going
19:53 - did I start early Oh actually you know
19:57 - what I think I did I think I know what I
20:05 - did let me go into my settings really
20:07 - quickly here no I didn't it is right
20:14 - today at 2:00 p.m. I thought that I
20:17 - accidentally set it for 2:00 a.m.
20:19 - instead of 2:00 p.m. but I didn't it it
20:22 - is 2:00 p.m. and I'm pretty sure that I
20:26 - did set it to promote it from one of my
20:31 - channel page for me yeah I did the
20:34 - settings right for a second uh-huh
20:39 - that's odd I did just get a notification
20:41 - on my phone from free code camp because
20:44 - I'm logged in on my personal account on
20:46 - my phone yeah then I didn't get the
20:51 - notification I got was from one of those
20:53 - videos and I did not get a notification
20:57 - about my livestream on my phone that's
21:04 - odd
21:07 - so there's there's actually a decent
21:10 - amount of activity on Twitter of people
21:12 - liking and retweeting the the link that
21:15 - I shared on Twitter for this but hmm oh
21:28 - well I'm not not too worried about it I
21:32 - mean if we get if nobody watches for
21:35 - like a week in a row then maybe I'll
21:37 - worry a little bit but for now I think
21:43 - it's okay
21:54 - okay yeah maybe it's just a weird thing
21:57 - with the notifications I didn't realize
22:00 - that many people relied on the
22:01 - notifications from YouTube so I don't
22:05 - think I can make it notification go out
22:07 - let me check the settings just really
22:10 - quickly broadcast alert yeah all the
22:19 - broadcast alert options are like
22:22 - technical difficulties or delays or
22:24 - something like that so I don't want to
22:27 - send one of those cuz that's not really
22:30 - accurate alright so
22:45 - let's see I'm checking out the live chat
22:49 - quickly Emilia lass is that scrolling
22:55 - effect part of react
22:56 - it is like extra smooth which scrolling
23:00 - effect just the normal scroll or like
23:04 - this this effect if you're talking about
23:09 - this navigation effect this is from it's
23:14 - not part of react this is like a custom
23:22 - it's just a little bit of JavaScript
23:24 - that does that so I think it's in I have
23:30 - Jess yeah this stick the sticky nav
23:37 - function so if you check out the the git
23:39 - repo the link to that's in the
23:42 - description and look in the app j/s file
23:46 - check out the function sticky enough and
23:49 - it's just a modified version of so mark
23:53 - synth did this on code pen and so I just
23:57 - modified it for for this use case and
24:01 - it's it's really short like you can see
24:07 - not very many lines at all and it's a
24:11 - nice effect so but I'm not even sure
24:13 - that you're talking about let's see if
24:20 - Patrick said you that his YouTube
24:22 - notifications have been all screwed up
24:24 - for all the channels for at least a week
24:27 - said the notifications end up being
24:29 - delayed
24:33 - Amelia said got the same notifications
24:36 - so maybe for these some people the
24:38 - notifications are just messed up the
24:45 - scroll okay so Amelia was saying the
24:47 - scroll for this video okay so that was
24:55 - that was what wooden Atia was talking
24:59 - about cool yeah the it's actually a cool
25:02 - effect what happens is there are two
25:06 - knives so this this nav gets cloned so
25:10 - there are actually two completely
25:12 - different elements so the one stays with
25:16 - its normal position and then the other
25:19 - one once you get to a certain point the
25:20 - other one goes with this position would
25:28 - be position fixed so I mean you can
25:30 - check it out there's actually some
25:32 - decent commenting and that's when this
25:37 - is from mark mark self put in the
25:40 - comments and I left them in there so if
25:43 - you've watched me you know I'm not great
25:45 - with commenting I'm gonna try to get
25:47 - better and upcoming projects but it
25:51 - should be pretty pretty easy to work out
25:56 - if you're familiar with jQuery then you
25:59 - should be able to work out what's going
26:00 - on okay
26:03 - so we've added this
26:13 - it wasn't refreshing can anybody guess
26:16 - why it wasn't refreshing it's still my
26:20 - dev server so I tried a little bit to
26:25 - get my dev server to work so I went in
26:28 - and remove like the the files that video
26:33 - all had said to try to remove and that
26:35 - didn't do anything but I didn't go so
26:37 - far as to clone the repo into a
26:39 - different folder just I was just working
26:43 - on other things and that did not work
26:51 - let me see what happened here
26:57 - all right I might have to put some
27:01 - importance in there let's see what
27:06 - happened
27:11 - well yep I just I even need to make this
27:15 - more specific or I'll pray I'll just
27:20 - make it more specific
27:28 - so let's add this in actually that's
27:41 - yeah it's I need to do this okay now go
27:50 - to refresh yeah there we go alright so
27:54 - you can see I refreshed it everything
27:59 - looks good
28:00 - last thing I need to do I mean probably
28:03 - should test it it was it was pretty good
28:07 - last thing I want to do is get rid of
28:10 - this so I'm gonna have to go to the
28:11 - documentation to have up on my other
28:15 - screen so I'll bring it over here and I
28:18 - have it a bit zoomed in I make it a bit
28:24 - smaller so there's a bunch of options so
28:30 - let's see they're probably already an
28:37 - option
28:51 - maybe there's not
28:55 - I figured there would be an option to
28:57 - hide the name of the video maybe run
29:02 - through it again
29:28 - all right yeah so my next idea then is
29:33 - figure out what what part of this
29:40 - controls like what element displays this
29:46 - and then maybe I can just get rid of it
29:49 - with CSS title yes
30:03 - all right so that works so we're just
30:13 - gonna get this JW title and we're gonna
30:16 - set it to display:none I'm gonna do that
30:18 - right in our CSS file so I'm just gonna
30:22 - copy this and get rid of this and I
30:31 - think it was called
30:33 - yeah JW title that was pretty
30:39 - straightforward so I'm going to save
30:41 - that and let's refresh to make sure that
30:45 - it's working all right
30:49 - awesome that works all right so that
30:51 - looks exactly the same as the other one
30:54 - did and if we use our client-side
30:57 - routing it should still work so I've
30:58 - gone to the bout now I'm gonna go back
31:00 - no page refresh and we still have our
31:03 - video awesome and let me check my great
31:09 - so even with me taking a little break to
31:12 - check the live chat that still didn't
31:15 - even take one Pomodoro session so we're
31:20 - ahead of schedule now
31:21 - so that really only took half I can get
31:26 - rid of these great move that's it done
31:33 - all right now let's figure out out of
31:35 - these what what's the most important I'm
31:39 - gonna move these to the bottom this geo
31:41 - locations
31:43 - what else the filters here because you
31:48 - know like I said these were things that
31:49 - I thought would be useful they're not
31:51 - really what what anyone's expecting for
31:57 - the site this can go down here too
32:02 - yeah I think maybe my boss had asked for
32:06 - this a long time ago so this is gonna be
32:10 - easy to put it I'll put this on the
32:11 - bottom I'm not really sure linked to
32:15 - directions yeah I'm not even really sure
32:18 - what I'm supposed to link to I have to
32:21 - go back through my emails and stuff to
32:23 - figure that out so we'll just leave that
32:24 - on the bottom for now too and anything
32:29 - that has like the categories and tags
32:31 - I'm gonna move this down because right
32:35 - now there's definitely not enough enough
32:38 - posts to warrant having categories and
32:41 - tags so if I don't get that in I think
32:45 - it'll be alright because I think even in
32:48 - a few months there's still not really
32:51 - going to be that much on here to warrant
32:53 - this because that you know they have the
32:55 - same staff that's going to be updating
32:57 - this site it's also going to be doing
32:59 - things for the learning management
33:01 - system and that actually did launch on
33:04 - Saturday
33:05 - like it was supposed to I'm assuming I
33:08 - didn't I didn't hear anything to the
33:09 - contrary so that did launch
33:18 - someone else had had joined in the
33:22 - livestream on Instagram so I didn't
33:26 - notice that I want to try to notice when
33:29 - somebody comes in on Instagram just to
33:31 - let them know what's up because
33:33 - otherwise people might not they're just
33:37 - gonna see my face with headphones on and
33:39 - I'm just talking to no one so that might
33:42 - look a little bit weird I'm talking
33:43 - about things they can't see I wish there
33:48 - was a way to like have a message up on
33:50 - the screen on Instagram just so I could
33:52 - let people know like hey I'm doing this
33:54 - live stream on YouTube if you want to
33:57 - see the code but as far as I know
33:58 - there's not a way to do that alright so
34:03 - basically from here down from here down
34:09 - don't have to worry about it
34:12 - all so yeah this is gonna go way at the
34:14 - bottom alright because I think this is
34:17 - another thing that I thought would be
34:19 - useful to have the link in the footer so
34:22 - if it doesn't get down nobody's gonna
34:23 - miss it add image to courses page okay
34:34 - yeah I'll leave that I'm just gonna move
34:38 - it down a bit because all these are go
34:41 - together
34:42 - alright so right now the news page is
34:46 - not there's no link to the news page you
34:48 - would have to type in the URL this would
34:51 - be like khattak addicts column slash
34:52 - news you can get to the news page like
34:54 - that so we're gonna check out the news
34:58 - page right now just to get you an idea
35:01 - of what's what still needs done I'm it
35:06 - looked at it in a little while okay so
35:08 - like is on the list we need to find an
35:11 - image edit the image so that it'll fit
35:14 - in this space I think I need something
35:16 - that's 2,000 pixels wide I can't
35:19 - remember the height off the hook it up
35:20 - so we'll find the image will edit the
35:23 - image we'll put it in here we have
35:26 - already our titles
35:30 - that are getting pulled in and I guess I
35:35 - don't have
35:47 - okay I'll see all right so I had had the
35:50 - idea of making the posts setting it so
35:54 - that you could have a post that only
35:56 - appeared on the home page and didn't
35:58 - show up in the news page and that was
36:00 - because some of these posts only just
36:03 - link somewhere else in the site and they
36:04 - just have a short sentence saying what
36:07 - it does so I didn't think it would even
36:09 - be worth it to have them show up here
36:11 - and then when you click on it it would
36:13 - go you know to a full page like this but
36:18 - then nothing would be displayed or maybe
36:21 - just one sentence now the problem with
36:23 - that is nothing will really show up at
36:31 - all and this was the whole reason we
36:34 - never shared the news page before I'm
36:38 - like I'm a little hesitant to even make
36:39 - this news page live because we still
36:43 - don't have anything here I know there
36:48 - was some content all right we're gonna
36:51 - do the work to get this news page ready
36:54 - but if I can't find some good content to
36:59 - go in here then maybe I'll maybe I'll
37:03 - wait
37:03 - I could always put something in there
37:05 - that would check to see how many posts
37:08 - are available and maybe change this link
37:13 - so that when we do get posts later on
37:15 - it'll automatically change and link to
37:17 - the right page and then that way I don't
37:19 - have to come in and edit it
37:34 - I'm not sure it happened there
37:45 - okay let me
37:56 - I'm going to commit what we did with the
37:58 - with the video use
38:31 - okay all right hey we're up to nine
38:35 - viewers now so we're getting up there
38:42 - it looks like and Tawana is asking it
38:48 - other videos at the beginning the
38:50 - projects and Zanna yes there's a thanks
38:52 - thanks for answering Zanna yeah check
38:55 - out there are also a few videos of the
38:59 - very beginning the project are on my
39:01 - youtube channel in the link to that is
39:03 - it's also in the description for this
39:05 - video on I see Amelia Amelia just
39:10 - answered that as well so once again I
39:16 - forgot to look down and see so thanks
39:19 - Amelia yeah
39:30 - all right so yeah Zanna said it's the
39:34 - feeling when one moves one card to to
39:37 - the done yeah that's a good feeling to
39:39 - move it over to done just look at this
39:42 - doesn't it sleep you get to the end of
39:45 - the project that looks amazing like this
39:48 - is all that's left to do I mean I know I
39:51 - have all this stuff that's like if I had
39:53 - a lot of time I would do this but
39:55 - ignoring this for a minute it's just
39:58 - really cool it feels really good I mean
40:00 - look at all this stuff in the done
40:03 - column just really cool to have all that
40:07 - I mean look that's you know over well
40:10 - over 200 Pomodoro sessions completed
40:13 - really cool that feels great all right
40:16 - well let's just start let's start
40:18 - getting these done so everything that
40:20 - has to do with music it's ticking and
40:22 - yeah are we don't I'm not gonna change
40:24 - that yet and so we have this finished
40:28 - and yeah so we'll do this then we'll
40:33 - move on to this we'll see how much time
40:35 - we have and go from there and let me try
40:44 - to keep accurate estimates of my time so
40:50 - I'm currently closing in on a hundred
40:52 - and fifty hours of development time for
40:55 - this that's a kind of a rough estimate I
40:59 - usually underestimate a bit because that
41:01 - doesn't include any meetings phone calls
41:04 - or emails about this which there were a
41:06 - lot so I think this is gonna end up
41:11 - including all the meetings and
41:13 - everything this is probably going to end
41:14 - up being close to 200 hours of
41:16 - development time for this Patrick asked
41:23 - what Chrome extension I'm using for the
41:25 - Trello thing and I always forget what it
41:29 - is let me look actually is it this one
41:33 - yeah okay so it's scrum for Trello so
41:38 - that's the
41:40 - so that's scrum SCR um Patrick I'm sure
41:45 - you know what scrum is but in case
41:46 - somebody's watching it's not familiar
41:47 - with scrum it SCR um for Trello all
41:55 - right let me get my my timer went off so
41:59 - since there's not a lot going on in the
42:01 - live chat right now although now we're
42:03 - up to eleven viewers so we're getting
42:06 - not nearly as many as we normally have
42:08 - but we're getting there
42:11 - let's see also just a heads up if you
42:15 - see any if if you happen to watch the
42:18 - Instagram thing although no I don't
42:20 - think anyone right now and you see
42:22 - somebody behind me my co-workers were
42:24 - plotting to to get on YouTube or
42:28 - Instagram or something by sneaking in
42:30 - and and looking they're gonna have a
42:32 - hard time though because I did lock my
42:34 - doors so but that was their plot alright
42:38 - so let's start up another Pomodoro
42:41 - session let's grab an image for this I
42:44 - need to find I think I have I don't
42:54 - remember where I have all the images I
42:56 - think they're my Google Drive
43:04 - and actually I did I got an SVG version
43:07 - of the logo as well that if we have time
43:10 - I'm gonna put in there so John Hanson
43:13 - who's often in the live chat converted
43:16 - the the loge of this logo into an SVG
43:20 - right now it's a ping I think so he sent
43:24 - me that and I'm going to while I'm in my
43:30 - Google Drive I'm just gonna download
43:31 - that as well
43:32 - since we might be using it Knox Aven I
43:41 - haven't really even had a chance to
43:42 - check it out yet but I'm a big fan of
43:46 - SVG's whenever I can use them I think it
43:49 - will end up looking that I don't know
43:51 - how it looks on your screen but on my
43:52 - screen this just does not look crisp at
43:54 - all until i if i zoom in like this it
43:57 - looks kind of crisp but it's just it
44:01 - doesn't look great so what did you off
44:06 - to check the file sizes and everything
44:08 - I'm pretty sure the SVG will end up
44:10 - being smaller but we'll we'll check that
44:14 - out in a minute right now I need to find
44:17 - hopefully I can find the so I'll bring
44:23 - it over on this screen when I find it
44:24 - just in case I have a lot of stuff from
44:26 - clients in my drive so I don't want to
44:28 - accidentally show anything from clients
44:30 - that I shouldn't on YouTube
44:37 - that's what my my son always asked if he
44:40 - can like play video games on my
44:42 - computers and stuff when I'm when I'm
44:44 - logged in and I always saw him like you
44:48 - can you can't like you could destroy so
44:50 - many people's websites if you got on my
44:54 - computer so especially I have a lot of
44:57 - things in LastPass so you know he
45:00 - wouldn't necessarily have to know the
45:01 - passwords with LastPass if he could
45:06 - figure out how to fill in everything
45:08 - with like he's only seven so but he got
45:11 - to be careful about that let me see
45:14 - so I think I found the right folder all
45:18 - right I did so let me bring this over
45:21 - and let's check out some of these images
45:25 - all right let me see how can i I'll zoom
45:31 - in a bit so what page this is the news
45:35 - page I'll say right away this image they
45:44 - didn't like this image before the people
45:47 - in charge the catechetical Institute as
45:49 - there's like a header image because I
45:53 - don't know because some of the stuff was
45:56 - out they just didn't like that some
45:57 - things were out of focus on other things
45:58 - weren't out of focus which I don't
46:00 - really know we could do anything about
46:01 - that like obviously you can't have the
46:02 - entire picture in focus if it's you know
46:05 - things are in the background also
46:08 - depending on the screen dimensions some
46:12 - people's you know their heads will get
46:14 - will won't be visible so they didn't
46:16 - like that as well so I think anything
46:18 - with people it's probably out so we just
46:21 - need to look at some of these shots of
46:23 - campus so that limits us to these and
46:29 - some of them have already been used
46:33 - you see also things like this that have
46:36 - an obvious focus they're probably going
46:38 - to be out of the question because once
46:40 - again if part of it gets cut off that
46:42 - they don't like that so like this isn't
46:45 - gonna work
46:46 - say I'm a bit limited
46:55 - actually I wonder about this one I don't
46:58 - think we've used this one
46:59 - let me check quickly see if we've used
47:04 - this one
47:11 - that looks decent I know they really
47:14 - want to use pictures of campus because
47:17 - the people that are going to be using
47:19 - their learning management system will
47:20 - most likely not visit campus so they
47:22 - want to give them a feeling of that this
47:25 - really is attached to a physical campus
47:27 - and not like it online only school
47:30 - that's that's how they explain their
47:33 - desire to have lots of the images of
47:36 - campus Timmy I'm gonna go through
47:39 - quickly and just make sure we're not
47:41 - using how we are using it shoot okay so
47:47 - using that this is different but it
47:51 - really looks the same let me see if we
47:53 - were using this I think we are let's
47:57 - check it out
48:00 - yep we're using that one too maybe not
48:04 - that one but it looks pretty close it's
48:09 - gonna settle think it's the same one no
48:13 - it's not the same one unless there's
48:15 - things getting cut off on the size oh
48:17 - maybe it is the same one yeah okay
48:22 - yeah that is the same one
48:34 - I think we're using this one too let me
48:38 - check the courses events
48:45 - resources to say
49:05 - yep that's it
49:09 - I've already already picked all the ones
49:11 - that'll work
49:12 - let's see this one now I'm using this
49:15 - one alright so that kind of leaves this
49:18 - as being one of the only ones that we
49:21 - haven't used yet I guess I'm really
49:24 - hesitant to use it because in some
49:27 - important parts of the picture are gonna
49:29 - be cut off but I don't really want to
49:35 - spend too much time worrying about this
49:42 - see this one
49:50 - I don't know if I could get a good crop
49:52 - on this so that it would work
50:04 - I guess I might be able to let me
50:08 - alright let's open this in Pixlr and I
50:14 - want to double-check the dimensions that
50:16 - I need
50:37 - oh yeah XANA I am choosing a header
50:40 - sorry I didn't I'm in check over there
50:48 - look Patrick's just got a bunch of
50:51 - YouTube notifications all at once so
50:55 - maybe maybe something was happening
51:06 - Ren's ass how long is this going Ren's a
51:10 - set of five minutes ago so if you're
51:13 - still there ends at least this is
51:16 - probably gonna go till 4:00 maybe later
51:21 - we'll just see how it goes
51:26 - Zanna says she does this in yeah I
51:28 - I actually I do use like for all
51:31 - the the thumbnails for my videos I do
51:35 - those in but it's just it's really
51:38 - convenient for minor things to just open
51:40 - this in the browser and I I don't have
51:42 - to worry about having things downloaded
51:44 - and so this this works for a lot of the
51:47 - stuff that I normally need to do but I
51:51 - do like a light I actually had
51:55 - never used it before and then when I
51:56 - first started streaming for free code
51:58 - camp they they have do their thumbnails
52:03 - in so both sent me both who does
52:07 - the JavaScript video sent me the
52:09 - template file so I had to learn how to
52:12 - use but he was really cool about it
52:14 - he actually he made a tutorial video for
52:16 - me so that I could learn how to edit
52:19 - things in so that was super helpful
52:21 - and it was really nice of him I could
52:24 - even hear like his kids were in the
52:25 - background and stuff so he took time out
52:27 - of his out of this time with his family
52:30 - to do the tutorial so those are really
52:34 - good guy if you get a chance to watch
52:36 - this videos check them out let's see
52:40 - sorry my other screen I'm going through
52:42 - my files trying to find where my there
52:48 - we go
52:50 - where these images are so that I can
52:52 - figure out what I need
52:59 - okay it looks like I need 2,000 by 500
53:07 - yeah
53:09 - all right so 2,000 by 500 what I need so
53:14 - let's adjust the image size
53:19 - okay so we're already at two thousand
53:21 - that's great now we just need to crop
53:25 - 500 out of here foot size okay
53:48 - mmm Wow all right so I guess I'll try to
53:54 - get this this cross this is a cool spot
53:58 - on campus they call it the Rosary circle
54:00 - so they actually have the same number of
54:04 - like bushes around here as there are
54:06 - beads on a rosary so that's kind of cool
54:09 - I had never knew that I had seen this
54:12 - for years and never realized that that's
54:14 - what it was until I started actually
54:18 - started working here but that's what it
54:22 - is that's kind of cool it's easier to
54:27 - tell like from an aerial shot than when
54:29 - you're actually walking around it
54:33 - alright I think that's
54:40 - that'll probably be about what we want
54:44 - all right so let's save this and use
54:55 - title
55:00 - know what an error card
55:03 - come on I don't want to save it's a
55:08 - Google Drive let's try to save it maybe
55:10 - that's why the error occurred that's
55:13 - kind of a really big file I if I have
55:17 - time I need to compress these images
55:21 - there's some other images on the site
55:23 - that I really want to cut down as well
55:43 - all right now let's try this out so
55:47 - where we had news where its title how
55:54 - did I have this
56:17 - I'm not even sure if I'm still using
56:19 - this maybe I am news yeah this was this
56:34 - is kind of a mess I really wanted to be
56:36 - able to just pass this in as a prop but
56:39 - I guess you can't do that if you're
56:41 - using the style JSX so so that's why I
56:48 - have this which seems crazy but it's
56:51 - because I couldn't pass it as a prop and
56:53 - I'm sure if I would have thought about
56:54 - it longer I could have figured out some
56:56 - way to make it work but for now that's
57:02 - that's just how it is let's go back here
57:05 - and see that's really weird why did that
57:11 - happen okay sometimes when I do it just
57:17 - does like a hot reload the styles that
57:21 - are in the dish style JSX tags don't get
57:24 - applied let's go back to our news page
57:33 - yeah
57:37 - so maybe it's not that's not where
57:48 - hmm
57:56 - then I'm not change the right spot let's
58:00 - see
58:03 - all right so yeah this is entitle the
58:06 - title component and C News News title
58:11 - okay oh I know what I didn't put it in
58:17 - the new folder I put it right in the
58:18 - image folder mm-hm
58:26 - still not working
58:46 - let's make sure that this is actually
58:48 - called news
58:56 - maybe I didn't put in news
59:10 - okay yes I've given the ID courses here
59:13 - to Maine so maybe I just didn't do that
59:14 - for news yet
59:25 - there we go all right great okay so we
59:29 - have that section all right as I move
59:33 - that around that's not bad I mean this
59:37 - no one's gonna have a screen like this
59:40 - I'm not worried about it but let's maybe
59:43 - see how it looks on this screen okay
59:47 - that's I can I can live with that
59:50 - so on most screen dimensions you can see
59:54 - you can still see the cross there I
59:56 - think they'll be happy with that awesome
60:04 - so yeah that definitely took longer than
60:08 - I hoped it took a bit longer than the
60:13 - one half but some let's go ahead and
60:17 - commit commit to change
60:35 - my livestream on Instagram stopped so I
60:40 - did it yesterday I think Instagram has a
60:42 - one hour time limit it seems like
60:44 - because I've been streaming for one hour
60:46 - so good to know and yesterday I didn't
60:53 - realize you could do this but you can
60:56 - make your livestream available for 24
60:58 - hours so I did do that so in case
61:00 - anybody does want to see it it's
61:03 - available it will be available for the
61:06 - next 24 hours so I'm trying to find my
61:11 - there it is my console
61:19 - whoa you sir okay that's our new file
61:24 - great
61:54 - all right great so that's done I'm gonna
61:59 - say I'm gonna just round this up and say
62:04 - that this did take one it almost took
62:12 - one
62:16 - or maybe yeah I didn't do a whole lot of
62:21 - looking at the live chat so I could
62:23 - could knock some time off for that but I
62:25 - think that took about one alright let's
62:28 - make news page alright so basically for
62:32 - this one I just want to clean up the
62:34 - page a little bit display what needs to
62:36 - be displayed this is no longer on hold
62:47 - let's see I want to briefly look through
62:56 - some of my I can't find it I had open my
63:05 - oh there we go my messages from my boss
63:10 - just to get through really quickly and
63:13 - see if the information that I needed was
63:22 - there no I don't think it is
63:30 - all right so I guess I could check my
63:34 - email quickly too if you remember I said
63:37 - there there was some extra information
63:38 - that could go here for some new posts so
63:52 - I want to find that but it's it's been a
63:54 - while
64:15 - yeah oh well it's not a big deal
64:19 - you know anyone could enter in that
64:22 - information from WordPress now it'll all
64:24 - get pulled in it's a wordpress so
64:26 - that'll be fun let's see we do need to
64:33 - check these out we need to edit these
64:36 - pages a bit I don't want the title to
64:40 - appear like this because if if you get a
64:43 - long title for a post it looks really
64:46 - weird and it extends out so it's just
64:48 - we're gonna change up how this the
64:51 - single news page works but for now I
64:59 - want to check out why I'm not getting
65:02 - the excerpt to display here and I guess
65:09 - it's not we don't really need it a
65:15 - hundred percent but usually that's
65:17 - something that's kind of expected
65:40 - all right so let's see what we're doing
65:42 - here
65:51 - okay so we're not we're not sending the
65:53 - excerpt in and let's see what it looks
66:00 - like on and WordPress
66:17 - all right so this is all the information
66:18 - I'm getting I'm putting in there in
66:21 - WordPress
66:41 - okay so this explains why we have no
66:44 - content because right now all we have is
66:50 - the excerpt and we have nothing in the
66:55 - actual content we also have no
67:03 - categories yet
67:12 - see
67:25 - which I think of the best thing to do
67:44 - okay let's see I'm gonna do my my short
67:48 - break here and check the live chat
67:53 - that'll give me a minute to think about
67:55 - what I want to do with this I'm gonna
68:04 - record what I did on my other screen
68:07 - here
68:20 - all right so I'm go back to the live
68:23 - chat Wow still only nine viewers
68:29 - yeah it must maybe it didn't alert
68:32 - people
68:52 - haha yeah you get Patrick must have
68:54 - heard the Bell the three o'clock Bell
68:57 - for for prayer time
69:12 - okay Umberto says that he never received
69:14 - an alert either hmm that must have been
69:20 - the problem then for some reason the
69:23 - alert did not go out that this would be
69:26 - this would be live so oh well I'm gonna
69:34 - double-check one more time let's see
69:36 - promotion promote on my channel page
69:47 - hmm
70:00 - yeah yeah all the settings are the same
70:03 - as I normally do
70:31 - mm-hmm okay so Joseph said he didn't get
70:36 - an alert either Umberto said looking at
70:39 - the alert option for this channel it
70:41 - looks like he got reset to off that's
70:43 - odd
70:45 - did get the alert okay so when I did I
70:48 - did do a stream earlier on my own my own
70:51 - channel and Joseph said he did get that
70:56 - alert okay that must be it then not
71:05 - really sure what I can do about that
71:07 - maybe later on I could try to look it up
71:12 - see if that's happened to anyone else
71:15 - before so I'm not if it if it keeps
71:21 - happening then I'll be a little bit more
71:24 - worried about it but I guess it'll be
71:26 - not that worried if it just happens the
71:29 - one time
71:40 - okay let's sum so yes there's not
71:45 - there's not that much going on in the
71:46 - live chat so I don't I'll be right on
71:49 - time usually I always go over my
71:54 - allotted time for checking the live chat
71:57 - at this time I don't think I will
72:13 - okay
72:39 - I think I probably will try to end this
72:43 - stream at like 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time at
72:49 - the latest because my the head of my
72:52 - department did want to kind of just meet
72:56 - and have me give her like a recap of
72:58 - what I did with this site so I want to
73:04 - make sure I finish up the stream before
73:05 - she for she wants to do that so she
73:08 - actually she might be stopping by my
73:10 - office in a little bit for that so just
73:14 - to let you all know probably would be at
73:17 - most two hour stream all right so my
73:23 - thoughts were basically it doesn't even
73:28 - make sense to have these right now be
73:31 - late
73:33 - you know cuz right now you know the the
73:39 - point of these is just to be basically
73:46 - links with with a little bit of text to
73:52 - you know right here so they're not even
73:57 - really meant meant to be like blog post
74:09 - oh I just had an idea
74:15 - all right here's what I'm thinking so
74:18 - right now these link to other places
74:23 - mostly I think within the site some of
74:27 - them to external places so what if when
74:34 - this option was checked
74:46 - if this is check that it's supposed to
74:49 - appear on a home page only then instead
74:59 - of only appearing on the home page it
75:01 - could also appear here but when you
75:02 - click the link it would go to the place
75:04 - would that be too confusing since this
75:07 - is apparently a blog page
75:25 - I don't know maybe I shouldn't so my
75:27 - original thought was that if something
75:30 - was basically not really a blog post it
75:32 - was just meant to link somewhere and
75:34 - then this would be checked and it would
75:35 - only show up on the home page and not
75:36 - back here the problem then is that right
75:39 - now we only have things like that we
75:41 - don't have any legitimate posts
76:01 - yeah I think I'll just go with that so
76:03 - here's what's gonna here's what I'm
76:04 - gonna do
76:05 - I'll check the live chat in a second to
76:07 - see if anyone is kind of has any opinion
76:11 - on this but what I'm gonna do is at
76:15 - least for now I'm just gonna put some
76:18 - test data in here just to see how this
76:21 - looks and if it looked okay I'm gonna
76:24 - just have it so that if it's checked if
76:28 - this box is checked for homepage only it
76:31 - won't show up here and they'll just have
76:36 - to put in you know put in things that'll
76:39 - show up at some point all right so let's
76:46 - go into yeah we'll do it we'll go to the
76:50 - news page and let's see if those content
76:57 - render it let's go so we have this is
77:05 - okay
77:16 - see how do I have this listed excerpt I
77:22 - think I'm going to grab this excerpt and
77:25 - make it what appears here below below
77:31 - this date so there's just a very short
77:34 - description
77:43 - so I need to pull in
78:03 - I think that's probably what it is find
78:07 - out in a second
78:54 - okay
79:02 - all right it's not bad
79:06 - that's pretty good I'm not sure about
79:09 - the dates I don't know what do you think
79:15 - about how the date looks to me at Denise
79:19 - I need to do something with it
79:39 - alright I'm gonna check the live chat
79:41 - quickly see what you all think
80:19 - okay all right so
80:29 - looks like looks like some people are
80:31 - saying if I don't have any content leave
80:33 - these in or potentially I could just put
80:36 - in some message saying there's no
80:37 - content if there's nothing I think I'll
80:40 - end up doing that saying there's no
80:41 - content just because I think that's
80:45 - going to be easier than trying to change
80:47 - with these link - I don't know maybe
80:52 - about the same but I just kind of don't
80:53 - want I don't want to make it so these
80:58 - link to internal pages I want to keep
81:02 - this as like a normal blog would
81:06 - function oops
81:32 - oh cool yeah Patrick just like this
81:37 - Patrick made some fireworks
81:39 - Foofa which a lot really cool I like
81:44 - that that looks really cool I'm gonna
81:48 - show my kids that they will love that I
81:54 - feel like I could spent so much time
81:56 - just watching that I need to like I need
82:02 - to minimize that quickly before I get
82:04 - any more distracted thanks for sharing
82:06 - that Patrick that was cool
82:17 - okay Umberto's says with the date-style
82:20 - thinking maybe like a lower color loaf
82:26 - yeah maybe yeah let's just let's open up
82:31 - dev tools here and just play around a
82:33 - little bit see what how we can give it a
82:35 - look
82:53 - hmm
82:56 - Oh
82:59 - see
83:25 - okay I could do the gold color and see
83:29 - how that looks
83:30 - I think this does need some padding
84:06 - what is going on
84:33 - ha letting me to look at the live shed I
84:37 - know you all caught what I was doing and
84:41 - now I feel like an idiot because I can't
84:48 - tell right from left
85:44 - all right
85:46 - I think that looks a little better
85:56 - you seem like here that this extends
86:00 - beyond you know where the title is so I
86:03 - wanted to line those up
86:07 - all right I'm I'm satisfied with that I
86:12 - think this is one of those things right
86:14 - I could spend a long time like changing
86:17 - one pixel here and there but I don't I
86:22 - don't know that it would be worth it
86:24 - so let's use this
86:34 - this was a spin
86:54 - I think I can actually just say span I
86:58 - don't have any other spans here and for
87:06 - some reason things that I pull in from
87:12 - the API that the styles that are in here
87:16 - don't get applied to that or at least
87:24 - they haven't been making they're
87:26 - supposed to and I'm doing something
87:27 - wrong
87:33 - oops
87:43 - all right let's see if that works yep
87:47 - great
87:50 - all right so that works
87:57 - now let's take a look at this interior
88:00 - page
88:10 - and let me before I commit this I'm
88:12 - gonna look at the live chat just in case
88:14 - I missed something
88:31 - okay Santa's and give something like
88:35 - read more yeah we could have something a
88:40 - little link that says read more made
88:43 - throughout
88:51 - we could have that I am I don't know
88:56 - what do you think do you think I should
88:57 - have that is that necessary throughout
88:59 - the site anytime that there's text in
89:01 - red it's a link so I mean we do have at
89:11 - least a pattern of things in in red
89:14 - being links I don't let me know what you
89:18 - think if if I really should put a read
89:20 - more link you know here that people can
89:25 - click on
90:01 - okay
90:04 - all right so
90:10 - all right so maybe I should put in a
90:13 - read more link all right let's do that
90:15 - let's put a read more link in and so
90:20 - that would be
90:33 - because here we'll put a span and now
90:38 - I'm gonna have to do
90:47 - maybe I'll just I'll leave this a span
90:50 - or I have the same styling as the date
90:56 - let me see
91:13 - because for now I think that'll be okay
91:25 - so I am gonna make this a link but for
91:28 - now I just want to see what it looks
91:29 - like
92:12 - hmm
92:22 - so definitely have to
92:49 - let's see
93:29 - all right see Alex
93:38 - all right that's not bad what do you
93:41 - think
93:53 - whoa saying there are two live streams
93:55 - now for free code camp yeah I've never
93:59 - seen that before either let me check
94:02 - that out
94:43 - okay it looks like from the channel it
94:46 - looks like that though isn't live but he
94:49 - did put a video up
94:58 - yeah an hour ago okay
95:11 - okay so it was just delayed okay cool
95:20 - hey John how's it going glad you could
95:23 - join us and thanks for that SVG I'm
95:28 - gonna try to get that in if I can if I
95:31 - have time today I really appreciate that
95:41 - Blake thanks for watching I'm not sure
95:45 - that I've seen you in the live chat
95:48 - before if I if you have been in the live
95:51 - chat and I just didn't remember I'm
95:52 - sorry about that but otherwise welcome
95:55 - and thanks for joining in okay so it
96:02 - seems like the consensus is that the
96:03 - read more looks good so let's actually
96:05 - make it a link now so we can just grab
96:12 - this
96:20 - let's see
96:34 - all right let's see how that up and I
96:37 - turned it blue it's very very sad
96:56 - area
96:59 - okay so that's cool resources yep so
97:05 - that's working how we wanted to alright
97:07 - great so that looks good now now I can
97:11 - commit
97:46 - okay
97:56 - all right and our Pomodoro session is
98:00 - almost up and let's see single news page
98:12 - that was what we're gonna move on to let
98:15 - me add on let's see alright so I mean
98:28 - we've we have actually completed this
98:33 - according to what this task was but I'm
98:40 - just gonna lump in the changing that
98:44 - single news page as well I don't want
98:46 - them don't want to make another card I
98:48 - have some time left in my estimate so
98:51 - it's possible that I just have assumed I
98:53 - was gonna do that as part of this before
98:55 - I made this so long ago I really can't
98:58 - looks like I added this card to ready
99:02 - for development on May 10 so I do know
99:04 - how long ago I actually made the card
99:08 - let's see a short break alright I think
99:12 - actually so think I'm actually I'm gonna
99:17 - go to the live chat answer some
99:19 - questions and then probably I'm gonna
99:24 - finish up then so I don't really want to
99:26 - start another Pomodoro cycle and another
99:29 - thing because then that'll put me over
99:32 - the the two-hour mark for this video so
99:36 - I do want to leave time to to wrap wrap
99:41 - up what I'm doing and then meet with my
99:46 - department head and give an overview of
99:50 - what all was done and I think I just got
99:54 - a text from my wife a few minutes ago
99:56 - that
99:59 - she has to do something at 4:30 yeah so
100:04 - I've never I'm gonna answer some
100:06 - questions and wrap it up and then call
100:09 - my wife to figure out if if that if the
100:13 - text she just sent me means that I need
100:14 - to be home very soon or what so I'm not
100:19 - sure with them he's but yeah let me
100:22 - check in the live chat here and see if
100:24 - I've missed anything I know there's not
100:25 - a whole lot of people here I'm like
100:30 - somewhat afraid that everybody's going
100:32 - to get a delayed notification for this
100:34 - and right when I'm about to end the
100:37 - stream
100:37 - you know everybody will join in at that
100:39 - point because they will have just gotten
100:40 - the notification so I kind of hope that
100:43 - doesn't happen I'd hate to bail on
100:47 - everybody right away all right so let me
100:53 - let's see what's in the chat here
101:11 - okay Susanna mentioned the read more
101:14 - link could actually make the the text
101:18 - like drop down and it just pushes
101:20 - everything else down but it would no
101:22 - longer up in a new post so I do I like
101:25 - Patrick says he likes that idea as well
101:28 - but so right now what will end up
101:34 - happening is that assuming that the
101:41 - people put inputting data follow what
101:43 - the instructions I'm gonna give them so
101:45 - I'm gonna make them a video to go
101:47 - through all of this you know how to how
101:50 - to update all content in WordPress and
101:52 - how it will look I am gonna say you know
101:55 - make sure if you don't have a lot of
101:57 - content you check the box so that it
101:59 - won't appear on the the news page and
102:06 - that way I will avoid having a page
102:10 - that's just mostly blank but I do want I
102:14 - like the idea of the accordion except I
102:17 - want people to be able to link directly
102:19 - to a blog post so especially like to
102:25 - share it on social media or something
102:26 - and for that it needs to have its own
102:29 - page I mean potentially it could do like
102:32 - some sort of like hash at the end of the
102:34 - URL but but then you know you still
102:37 - wouldn't get the data being pulled into
102:40 - social media properly so I think it
102:43 - should have its own page and just
102:46 - hopefully they take my advice and only
102:50 - make a full page you know post
102:57 - I'm gonna recommend that every like
103:00 - legitimate blog post needs to have at
103:02 - least 300 words that's usually when I
103:07 - use I used to do a lot of search engine
103:09 - optimization like copywriting and so
103:12 - like ghost blogging and things for
103:13 - companies and I always said like every
103:17 - post needs to be at least 300 words I
103:19 - didn't want it to appear to be like
103:20 - shallow content so that's that's what
103:24 - I'm gonna recommend okay I see as Anna
103:33 - says if it's a longer post it could open
103:35 - a new post so it could be either or I
103:38 - yeah I do like that idea I'm probably
103:40 - not gonna do it just because at this
103:41 - point I'm running out of time
103:44 - so I'll probably just keep it as is for
103:46 - now
104:06 - okay so food says awesome work Jessie
104:10 - thanks I appreciate that and thanks for
104:14 - joining in the the live chat thanks for
104:16 - watching
104:19 - Blake s what's the link for the timer
104:23 - it's just tomato timer comm see if I can
104:31 - yeah so tomato timer com tomato - timer
104:35 - comm yeah no problem
104:45 - pooch says what advice would you give to
104:48 - someone who's learning wordpress along
104:50 - with code yeah that's actually kind of
104:55 - how I learned I would say this
105:03 - definitely seems to be like a wordpress
105:05 - way of doing things and that's I mean in
105:08 - terms of they have like these these
105:11 - hooks and everything is done through
105:13 - that so in terms of like how you write
105:15 - PHP I guess just be aware that the
105:18 - WordPress way of doing it isn't you know
105:21 - that's specific to WordPress and that
105:23 - isn't used everywhere so just kind of be
105:25 - aware of that and then I would you know
105:28 - when you can do projects that don't
105:30 - involve WordPress you know try that
105:32 - because there's a lot of things that
105:34 - WordPress does for you that if you're
105:37 - gonna do a project from scratch you know
105:40 - you need to worry about so things like
105:41 - like routing WordPress does that for you
105:45 - but you know normally if you're doing a
105:47 - project just from scratch with just
105:49 - JavaScript you'd have to come up with
105:51 - some sort of routing system like
105:54 - templating so there's just so many
105:56 - built-in things with WordPress that if
105:58 - you only stuck with WordPress you
105:59 - wouldn't even realize what goes into
106:01 - that or how to do that so that would be
106:05 - my advice is I think WordPress is great
106:08 - it lets you build nice-looking really
106:13 - nice-looking sites you know really
106:14 - functional sites without having to worry
106:17 - so much about all
106:18 - other stuff and without really having to
106:20 - know about back-end things but if if you
106:24 - really want to kind of learn how
106:25 - everything works then I would try to do
106:27 - some things not in WordPress and it'll
106:32 - just give you a much better idea of what
106:34 - goes in and you will you'll actually
106:36 - appreciate everything that WordPress
106:37 - does for you so that's that's kind of my
106:42 - my advice and also like learn how to use
106:45 - some of the build tools that you would
106:47 - use normally on a JavaScript project
106:49 - that you wouldn't normally use with
106:51 - WordPress so I'm talking about like you
106:56 - know using let's say like gulp or web
107:00 - pack or something
107:02 - all from the you know learning how to
107:04 - use the command line using git I think
107:07 - those sort of things are they're not
107:09 - used as commonly with WordPress because
107:12 - you don't you can start up a wordpress
107:15 - site without that and you can work on it
107:17 - without it so it's not quite as common
107:20 - but I think those are important things
107:21 - to know so that would be my advice
107:24 - hopefully that helped a bit
107:34 - okay so John actually said it was a very
107:37 - delayed notification you know I'm gonna
107:40 - have to really be more disciplined about
107:43 - scheduling the time for the video
107:45 - earlier in the day usually what I what
107:49 - I've done is like I just put it off
107:52 - until later on and then that gives me a
107:54 - better idea of what I'm actually going
107:55 - to be working on so I can I can write a
107:58 - better description for the video but I
108:00 - think maybe it would be better to maybe
108:05 - my my titles and descriptions aren't
108:07 - quite accurate but if I were to let's
108:10 - say it like you know maybe 9:00 9:00
108:14 - a.m. you know Eastern Time or 10 I would
108:18 - have the video already scheduled and it
108:20 - would already be notifying maybe maybe
108:23 - then there'd be a better chance of the
108:25 - notifications coming maybe when I wait
108:27 - till the last minute it's just you know
108:30 - that's causing the delay I don't really
108:33 - know I mean you would think that you
108:34 - could start the stream you know and then
108:36 - a minute later the notification would go
108:38 - out but maybe that's it so I'm gonna
108:40 - make a better effort to not wait until
108:44 - the last minute get the stream schedule
108:47 - and then because I usually know like as
108:52 - soon as I get into work I have a decent
108:54 - idea of whether or not I'll be able to
108:56 - stream at the proper time you know 2
108:58 - p.m. Eastern so I should be able to
109:00 - schedule and if I have to change it
109:03 - later on that I do change it but maybe
109:07 - that will help
109:15 - okay so Patrick says that he thinks that
109:18 - the 300 word count for search engine
109:20 - optimization is outdated and it's
109:22 - actually longer now okay that's good to
109:24 - know
109:25 - okay Zanna says like 500 words maybe
109:28 - I'll recommend 500 then I think to
109:32 - recommend I'll go ahead and recommend
109:36 - about 500 I was just thinking I don't
109:42 - want to make it too daunting of a task
109:44 - for them but then on second thought I I
109:47 - thought you know throughout this entire
109:49 - process for the site I kept on saying it
109:52 - would be better if we had less text so I
109:55 - kind of think it's not really gonna be a
109:58 - problem for them to hit that 500 word
109:59 - count since they seem to be going over
110:03 - the amount of text that I that I think
110:07 - they should have in most of the other
110:08 - parts of the site so thanks for that
110:11 - I'll go with 500 words I haven't done
110:13 - like real SEO work in so long and that
110:16 - feel it changes so often that I don't
110:19 - really feel confident that I'm up on the
110:21 - latest things I'm sure there's probably
110:23 - some fundamental things that pretty much
110:25 - stay the same and I'd be good with that
110:27 - but I wouldn't I wouldn't say that I'm
110:30 - nearly as knowledgeable about current
110:34 - trends and SEO as I used to be used to
110:37 - be I used to be able to get sites to the
110:39 - you know right to the top of the first
110:42 - page and in small markets
110:45 - you know usually within you know within
110:49 - months I could I could for sure get him
110:51 - up I had like I had like a plan and if
110:56 - you just stuck to the plan you know it
110:59 - seemed like it always worked
111:00 - like I said in small markets not in like
111:03 - high competition places but usually like
111:09 - when that starts happening and you can
111:11 - continually consistently get sites
111:13 - ranked higher with the formula then
111:15 - things change the algorithms changed and
111:18 - I wasn't like spamming bad content my my
111:22 - philosophy and
111:24 - when copywriting was always yes you want
111:27 - to do it so you can get ranked higher
111:29 - but I always wanted to give users
111:31 - something useful to them and meaningful
111:34 - even if my main purpose in writing is
111:37 - just to get you know more to get rank
111:42 - higher and the search engine rankings
111:44 - then I still wanted to provide some
111:47 - benefit so I think that's really what
111:49 - it's about is if you provide something
111:52 - beneficial and substantial consistently
111:55 - then eventually you will rank higher as
111:58 - long as you're doing the fundamental
111:59 - things like you know you have your HTML
112:00 - formatted properly and things like that
112:02 - title tags title tags always found to be
112:06 - really important I assume they're still
112:09 - important
112:17 - all right Gaurav says looks good man
112:19 - thanks thanks I appreciate that
112:29 - yeah then I said I hope they won't ask
112:32 - you to write their content - yeah it
112:34 - definitely won't be I don't write
112:36 - content anymore I'm not really it's I'm
112:39 - not into that so I I do not offer that
112:43 - service to clients anymore yeah so
112:49 - there's a dimension since they expect
112:51 - design tests from you yeah I still I do
112:53 - design and that's out of necessity
112:55 - because there's no one else that can do
112:57 - design but we have we have we actually
112:59 - have writers on staff in my department
113:01 - so since we have writers we have graphic
113:06 - designers but they just stick with print
113:07 - stuff mostly so and we have writers but
113:13 - we don't have a web designer so I end up
113:17 - doing the web design as well
113:28 - yeah John says it's hard to convince
113:30 - people to have good and relevant tax
113:32 - count on websites everyone wants to go
113:34 - for the minimalist white-on-white look
113:36 - yeah I mean I like minimalist in general
113:41 - but I do you you need to have a certain
113:46 - word count I think on on a page but
113:50 - there were some pages where I kept I
113:53 - wanted to keep a large font size so I'm
113:56 - convinced that the one of the keys to
113:59 - having people actually read your content
114:01 - is to have a decent sized font so like
114:05 - I'm not really comfortable going below
114:07 - like 18 pixels for most font sizes
114:11 - because it's just hard to read I mean it
114:16 - really it depends on your screen and how
114:18 - far away you are from your screen
114:19 - different things like that but basically
114:20 - like I'm way less likely to read
114:24 - something if the font is small and I
114:26 - have to like really focus on it and I
114:29 - have I have good vision I've good
114:31 - eyesight you know I'm young so I can
114:34 - imagine people who have difficult you
114:36 - know they don't have good vision or
114:37 - they're older like it's got to be
114:39 - terrible for them to try to read this
114:40 - small font so having said that if you're
114:44 - gonna go with a large font you have to
114:47 - cut down the amount of text otherwise it
114:49 - just seems like an overwhelming amount
114:51 - of text because you have this large font
114:54 - size now so I like to increase font size
114:56 - decrease the amount of text and then
114:58 - it'll be easier for people to read and
115:00 - there'll be less that they have to read
115:02 - so it's more likely that they'll read a
115:04 - higher percentage of the content on
115:07 - every page so I think that's my
115:11 - philosophy on things maybe I may be
115:16 - mistaken but
115:23 - see
115:29 - all right cool yeah so John mentioned
115:35 - the Meta Description tag is ignored by
115:38 - search engine yeah so if you're still
115:41 - using the Meta Description tag on your
115:42 - site just stop it's not used by search
115:47 - engines well I shouldn't say stop here's
115:53 - my feeling that Meta Description tag if
115:55 - you don't use it a search engine will
115:58 - just pull content from your site anyway
116:00 - and it'll probably be relevant and it'll
116:02 - match up with whatever the search term
116:04 - was so you can add it if you really want
116:09 - to specify what the description would be
116:12 - but it's totally not necessary so I
116:17 - guess it just depends on what you want
116:19 - I've gone back and forth on it sometimes
116:21 - depending on whether you know depending
116:24 - on what I want so if you have a certain
116:27 - like marketing message that you really
116:29 - want to appear then I guess you use use
116:31 - it otherwise like don't worry as much
116:34 - about it because the search engine will
116:37 - pull what they want
116:47 - yeah Johnson yeah thanks for clarifying
116:51 - yeah I didn't mean let me clarify that
116:55 - because I don't mean so John is rightly
116:58 - bringing up that it's the the meta or
117:02 - the keywords so like the meta keywords
117:04 - are not crawled like so those won't be
117:07 - called the description will they'll see
117:10 - the description another use of
117:11 - description but it won't count in terms
117:13 - of your your ranking so it's it's not
117:20 - like it's invisible to search engines
117:24 - but it won't like don't keywords stuff
117:27 - your description right because that's
117:29 - not going to do anything for you in
117:31 - terms of search ranking right your
117:33 - description in a way that's going to
117:35 - appeal to your users okay don't don't
117:38 - consider search engines when you're
117:40 - doing your description does that make
117:43 - more sense
117:43 - I probably shouldn't talk about SEO at
117:48 - all anyway since I'm not I'm not really
117:51 - up on it so like I said I haven't done
117:55 - anything with search engine optimization
117:57 - in probably two years so don't don't
118:01 - take what I say as as accurate anymore
118:14 - but I think it's it's been true for a
118:17 - long time so it's true to say don't use
118:20 - meta keywords if you do use the Meta
118:25 - Description write it to your users don't
118:28 - worry about search engines because they
118:30 - won't use that as a ranking factor the
118:35 - title tag is important to have the
118:40 - proper wording in because at least it's
118:44 - been my experience that the title tag is
118:46 - actually very important in terms of what
118:49 - keywords you actually rank for and your
118:52 - header tags alright so I'm not I'm not
119:03 - gonna comment any more on on search
119:05 - engine optimization because I I think
119:08 - saying less is better at this point
119:09 - because I don't want to mess any one
119:11 - site up by giving incorrect advice on on
119:15 - that but I'm thinking I'm gonna I'm
119:20 - gonna wrap up this stream thanks for
119:24 - watching like I said I'm gonna try to
119:28 - schedule the streams earlier so you all
119:30 - can get hopefully get the notifications
119:33 - on time and not late so I apologize for
119:38 - that I hadn't anticipated that that
119:40 - would happen I'm not entirely sure why
119:43 - it happened but just in case it was
119:46 - because of the timing of me starting
119:50 - scheduling the stream I'll try to do it
119:52 - earlier so tomorrow I will be back with
119:57 - an entirely new project I'm not exactly
119:59 - sure what it'll be but it'll be new so
120:03 - thank you so much to everyone who helped
120:05 - out with this project I think it turned
120:07 - out really well and way better with your
120:10 - help than it ever could have been with
120:12 - just me working on it I really
120:14 - appreciate that and yeah I think that's
120:22 - that's it for today's stream see
120:24 - tomorrow and have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone it's Jessie and today is the last day that I will be working on this project so so far for all of my streams for free code camp I've been working on this one project this react site and today's the last day so I'm really excited I'm excited to move on to my next project I'm not actually entirely sure what my next project will be there's a couple of different options my boss is still on his honeymoon I think he gets back today she might be um by now I'm not sure but he'll be in tomorrow and then we'll we'll decide together what my next project will be but there's a good chance it'll be another react another react site so before I get started today I just want to give a birthday shout out to a friend of mine Zach Levin Dorf who's I hope he doesn't mind me giving this shout out like this but I just wanted to mention him on on this stream because if it wasn't for him I probably would not be here doing this stream like I wouldn't be a developer at all so I don't know maybe five years ago or so something like like that I really needed a job and I was about to take a job that I didn't even really want to do but it was just going to be something to pay the bills and he offered me a job doing basically subcontracting work for him and he had like a media marketing company and he I had known him before and I had known his family so he knew that I was a decent guy and so he gave me a chance even though I hadn't built any websites for a really long time and he actually would would tell me like hey I'll pay you for so many hours just go learn how to do this and I'll pay you for it which was really cool because I really you know I had a few kids at the time and I really needed the money and I didn't have a lot of a lot of time to go and learn on my own I needed to be working so that really helped so for a few years I did a lot of work with him and anyway so I'm not sure if he's gonna watch or not I told him I was gonna give him a shoutout so I just wanted to to tell him happy birthday and just let everybody know how important it is he was kind of like a mentor to me at a time when I was just starting out and not really sure what I wanted to do so if you have a chance to do something like that for someone definitely do that it doesn't have to be I guess like an official mentor like you know he he wasn't my mentor officially Wicker we worked together but he taught me a lot about freelancing in general you know how to handle clients and contracts and billing and you know a lot of things like that a lot about WordPress and about search engine optimization and and he was he's a really good designer as well so he taught me a lot about design and yes that was that was cool we had we spent we spent a lot of time we would just stay up all night and work on build websites and those were some of the best learning experiences you know because we would take a break and get something to eat and just and talk for awhile in between coding sessions and that was really important for me when I was just starting out so if you ever have a chance to do that with somebody that's just starting out it'll definitely make a big difference to them it might not might not be that big of a deal to you it might not be that hard for you to do but it can make a big impact on someone so I hope that I can have that same impact on somebody one day and kind of pay it forward but I'm gonna check the live chat yeah actually Patrick is asking what happened to the viewer count yeah this is really weird so usually at the beginning of the streams the analytics there's some lag time or something so it shows like zero viewers for a minute or so but actually this is really this is really odd because it's showing three viewers and it should have already refreshed so anyway yeah Patrick I don't know what happened the last time something like this happened I didn't realize it but I think I was streaming during like Facebook's livestream of of one of their conferences so maybe maybe there's something happening that I'm missing I don't really know but I did let me double check I usually put the link on on Twitter yeah I did at 200 p.m. Eastern time I put the link on Twitter I put the right time okay did everything I the the tweet has it hasn't gone out to that many people but yeah I did everything right I mean I did send it out you know less than an hour ago but yeah I don't really know what's what's going on but it's fine with me I still need to do the work anyway so I mean I hope I didn't do anything wrong and people are like I hope people aren't getting blocked out of seeing this but let me I guess really quickly I'm going to go on another browser and try to to watch the stream I should be able to just maybe do an incognito window and let's see all right so I'm gonna go on my other screen I'm going to freak out camp yeah it does say live now free code camp I'm gonna try to click it okay cool I was able to get in and watch so but it does say yeah there's only six people watching that's crazy alright well anyway you know actually the the title that I gave the video was not really enticing I just said it was finishing my react site so maybe people aren't really interested in seeing me finish this usually I'm more a more descriptive title so maybe maybe that's why or maybe there's something else live that's really important I mean did something crazy happen on the news and I'm just not aware of it I don't know anyway I'm gonna go ahead and get started so as the title says I am just trying to finish up the site today so I'm gonna show you here's my Trello board and the link to this is in the description so in case you really do want to check out the board it's it's public also like I did yesterday to start out with if you're interested in seeing my facial expressions as I code and seeing a little bit of what my office looks like you can check me out on on Instagram on my phone I'm livestreaming on Instagram the the view like looking right at my face as I as I code so the link to my Instagram is also in the in the description but as you can see right now I'm working on this JW player so I had changed from a YouTube embed and this was over the weekend I think I changed from a YouTube embed to JW player embed the problem was the normal embed that that's a script tag it loads the first time you load the home page but then after that when you use the clientside routing it doesn't load so there's there's not really anything like I can initialize it and component did mount or anything as far as I know I had thought about maybe trying to do something like that but I found a plugin I'm sorry like a react component for JW player and I set it up I had a little bit of trouble getting the right info but Sebastian is usually in the in the live streams he had mentioned like why don't I just check out the the actual JavaScript file that I was that I was pulling in from the normal embed and if I scroll down to the bottom there was a bunch of info there so using that info and then rereading the documentation on the on the component I was able to get it working the problem is it's not displaying like the full width of the screen like the other one was like I wanted it to so I need to figure out what's going on right now I'm just kind of comparing the CSS for the old layouts doing it in the new way and trying to match it up is exactly is it because I can I thought I had it messed up exactly but it's still not working so I'm gonna give it maybe just one more Pomodoro session and if I can't get it done then I'm gonna go with Plan B which is I'm not gonna use clientside routing for when people go to the home page I really don't want to do that because then I'm losing a lot of the advantages of you know the speed of being able to just do the clientside routing but I don't really have time right now to spend a whole lot of time on this and it it just needs to be done so that's the plan hopefully I can get it working though I really don't want to go with with Plan B and disable that clientside routing and what I mean by that is it's gonna actually refresh the page and so that way the video will play again because it'll have a full page refresh and as you can see I have basically this is it this is all that really needs done and actually everything on this list doesn't absolutely need to be done so some of the things I just really want to get done like we had the geolocation to sort events by distance this was never something that was asked for on the site this was just something that I thought was a really obvious feature that should be on the site so if I can't get to this this art the geolocation already works I just need to have some indication in the user interface that you can do that because right now there's there's no indication at all that you can click on distance and sort by distance so I'm sorry click on location and sort by distance in the same way with the tables you can sort things in the tables by clicking on the table headers but there's no indication that you can do that so right now it's more of like an easter egg on the site so if I need to I can put off some of these probably in a few months I'll be able to come back and work on some of these things again but for now probably have looks like four four and a half Pomodoro sessions according to my estimates that I should be able to get this done so it might take more or less depending on how accurate my estimates are and then that's in addition not including this other Pomodoro session so I'm guessing probably like 600 to probably about six sessions that's a 25 minutes a session with some breaks in between that's about three hours since I'll be streaming for a lot of that time I'm gonna say probably four hours of work since I usually have questions and things although if I continue to only have six viewers there probably won't be that many questions so though I could see Alberto is in the stream hey Alberto glad that you could you could join us okay this reminds me when I first started streaming and I would have is actually worse when I first started sometimes I'd be no one watching or just one person watching so maybe I'll get more done since I won't have as much activity in the stream I am a little bit nervous that like some terrible thing happened and everybody's watching the news and I don't know about it but I would think my coworkers would let me know like I'd be getting something my phone would be buzzing and with with news updates I suppose but it is a little weird alright so let's go with this oh I did want to say to my my very first video for free code camp now has over 10,000 views so it's really excited about that I noticed yesterday that it had I hadn't checked the view count in a long time and I noticed that I was I needed less than 50 views to get to 10,000 so I was excited so I kept kept watching it so this morning when I checked it I had I think ten thousand and three views so that was really cool so thanks everyone for for watching and everybody that that viewed it and it has a bunch of thumbs up mostly thumbs up not too many thumbs down so that's really really cool let's let me bring over let me start my my Pomodoro timer so let's pull I'll pull this over here and I guess here's what I'm going to do for right now I'm gonna bring over dev tools for both versions so on on the left hand side this is the new way that I'm embedding using the JW player react component and this is the older way using just this script tag so let me let me know if this font size is too small it looks a bit small but since I'm I don't want to make it too big because I need to be able to see both these things so just let me know I I could probably make it a little bit bigger and it'll still work but really what I want to do is I'm gonna look at this this is the first component that really gets it gets added dynamically alright so that's the one that I want to compare because everything else that's containing it is exactly the same because these are components that I have direct control over so let's look at this top level component I think this is all we'll have to to edit potentially maybe if if I get these exactly the same in terms of their CSS properties and it still doesn't work I'll have to dig down in farther and see that maybe some something down in here you know it looks the same right now actually I may have just figured it out just kind of inadvertently what is this JW aspect JW aspect all right let me check a little bit excited I think I may have just figured this out so let me all right so with heightauto that's what it needs to be let's set this to displayblock and we need this padding top we need 50 6.25% oh man that works awesome let me pull this over really quick all right so it worked before I just saw nothing and ice that's really awesome I think I want to I want to see if there are some options for me to take take away this I don't need that in there and let's see what happens ok cool the controls come up great oh man what what good luck the fact I wasn't even gonna dig down in there and check it out but that was it it was the very first thing I looked at ok so I need to probably the best way to do this is just in my in my CSS file I'm just going to add this I'm gonna target this class J to the aspect I just want to make sure really quickly that that same class isn't used I don't see it being used yeah that was good okay so I think if I just started getting this JW aspect class and actually let me just I'm just gonna copy that I'm gonna set it to displayblock and then I'm going to add this padding and that should be it that should fix it so I had to comment I hate to use important too often but I I had to override it cuz there's there may be some way for me to change that through the through the react component there probably is some way but at this point you know this is this will work so I'm just gonna go with that and the odds of me actually having to use this component and future projects are really small so I just don't really want to dig that deep into it to learn it later on if I need it then that's fine I'll you know maybe I will dig deeper but for now I don't want to be here all night working on this so let's try it out I'm gonna save that and then I have to do after you hard refresh cuz the hot like reload doesn't work with my stylesheet hey zanna's here hey how's it going did I start early Oh actually you know what I think I did I think I know what I did let me go into my settings really quickly here no I didn't it is right today at 200 p.m. I thought that I accidentally set it for 200 a.m. instead of 200 p.m. but I didn't it it is 200 p.m. and I'm pretty sure that I did set it to promote it from one of my channel page for me yeah I did the settings right for a second uhhuh that's odd I did just get a notification on my phone from free code camp because I'm logged in on my personal account on my phone yeah then I didn't get the notification I got was from one of those videos and I did not get a notification about my livestream on my phone that's odd so there's there's actually a decent amount of activity on Twitter of people liking and retweeting the the link that I shared on Twitter for this but hmm oh well I'm not not too worried about it I mean if we get if nobody watches for like a week in a row then maybe I'll worry a little bit but for now I think it's okay okay yeah maybe it's just a weird thing with the notifications I didn't realize that many people relied on the notifications from YouTube so I don't think I can make it notification go out let me check the settings just really quickly broadcast alert yeah all the broadcast alert options are like technical difficulties or delays or something like that so I don't want to send one of those cuz that's not really accurate alright so let's see I'm checking out the live chat quickly Emilia lass is that scrolling effect part of react it is like extra smooth which scrolling effect just the normal scroll or like this this effect if you're talking about this navigation effect this is from it's not part of react this is like a custom it's just a little bit of JavaScript that does that so I think it's in I have Jess yeah this stick the sticky nav function so if you check out the the git repo the link to that's in the description and look in the app j/s file check out the function sticky enough and it's just a modified version of so mark synth did this on code pen and so I just modified it for for this use case and it's it's really short like you can see not very many lines at all and it's a nice effect so but I'm not even sure that you're talking about let's see if Patrick said you that his YouTube notifications have been all screwed up for all the channels for at least a week said the notifications end up being delayed Amelia said got the same notifications so maybe for these some people the notifications are just messed up the scroll okay so Amelia was saying the scroll for this video okay so that was that was what wooden Atia was talking about cool yeah the it's actually a cool effect what happens is there are two knives so this this nav gets cloned so there are actually two completely different elements so the one stays with its normal position and then the other one once you get to a certain point the other one goes with this position would be position fixed so I mean you can check it out there's actually some decent commenting and that's when this is from mark mark self put in the comments and I left them in there so if you've watched me you know I'm not great with commenting I'm gonna try to get better and upcoming projects but it should be pretty pretty easy to work out if you're familiar with jQuery then you should be able to work out what's going on okay so we've added this it wasn't refreshing can anybody guess why it wasn't refreshing it's still my dev server so I tried a little bit to get my dev server to work so I went in and remove like the the files that video all had said to try to remove and that didn't do anything but I didn't go so far as to clone the repo into a different folder just I was just working on other things and that did not work let me see what happened here all right I might have to put some importance in there let's see what happened well yep I just I even need to make this more specific or I'll pray I'll just make it more specific so let's add this in actually that's yeah it's I need to do this okay now go to refresh yeah there we go alright so you can see I refreshed it everything looks good last thing I need to do I mean probably should test it it was it was pretty good last thing I want to do is get rid of this so I'm gonna have to go to the documentation to have up on my other screen so I'll bring it over here and I have it a bit zoomed in I make it a bit smaller so there's a bunch of options so let's see they're probably already an option maybe there's not I figured there would be an option to hide the name of the video maybe run through it again all right yeah so my next idea then is figure out what what part of this controls like what element displays this and then maybe I can just get rid of it with CSS title yes all right so that works so we're just gonna get this JW title and we're gonna set it to displaynone I'm gonna do that right in our CSS file so I'm just gonna copy this and get rid of this and I think it was called yeah JW title that was pretty straightforward so I'm going to save that and let's refresh to make sure that it's working all right awesome that works all right so that looks exactly the same as the other one did and if we use our clientside routing it should still work so I've gone to the bout now I'm gonna go back no page refresh and we still have our video awesome and let me check my great so even with me taking a little break to check the live chat that still didn't even take one Pomodoro session so we're ahead of schedule now so that really only took half I can get rid of these great move that's it done all right now let's figure out out of these what what's the most important I'm gonna move these to the bottom this geo locations what else the filters here because you know like I said these were things that I thought would be useful they're not really what what anyone's expecting for the site this can go down here too yeah I think maybe my boss had asked for this a long time ago so this is gonna be easy to put it I'll put this on the bottom I'm not really sure linked to directions yeah I'm not even really sure what I'm supposed to link to I have to go back through my emails and stuff to figure that out so we'll just leave that on the bottom for now too and anything that has like the categories and tags I'm gonna move this down because right now there's definitely not enough enough posts to warrant having categories and tags so if I don't get that in I think it'll be alright because I think even in a few months there's still not really going to be that much on here to warrant this because that you know they have the same staff that's going to be updating this site it's also going to be doing things for the learning management system and that actually did launch on Saturday like it was supposed to I'm assuming I didn't I didn't hear anything to the contrary so that did launch someone else had had joined in the livestream on Instagram so I didn't notice that I want to try to notice when somebody comes in on Instagram just to let them know what's up because otherwise people might not they're just gonna see my face with headphones on and I'm just talking to no one so that might look a little bit weird I'm talking about things they can't see I wish there was a way to like have a message up on the screen on Instagram just so I could let people know like hey I'm doing this live stream on YouTube if you want to see the code but as far as I know there's not a way to do that alright so basically from here down from here down don't have to worry about it all so yeah this is gonna go way at the bottom alright because I think this is another thing that I thought would be useful to have the link in the footer so if it doesn't get down nobody's gonna miss it add image to courses page okay yeah I'll leave that I'm just gonna move it down a bit because all these are go together alright so right now the news page is not there's no link to the news page you would have to type in the URL this would be like khattak addicts column slash news you can get to the news page like that so we're gonna check out the news page right now just to get you an idea of what's what still needs done I'm it looked at it in a little while okay so like is on the list we need to find an image edit the image so that it'll fit in this space I think I need something that's 2,000 pixels wide I can't remember the height off the hook it up so we'll find the image will edit the image we'll put it in here we have already our titles that are getting pulled in and I guess I don't have okay I'll see all right so I had had the idea of making the posts setting it so that you could have a post that only appeared on the home page and didn't show up in the news page and that was because some of these posts only just link somewhere else in the site and they just have a short sentence saying what it does so I didn't think it would even be worth it to have them show up here and then when you click on it it would go you know to a full page like this but then nothing would be displayed or maybe just one sentence now the problem with that is nothing will really show up at all and this was the whole reason we never shared the news page before I'm like I'm a little hesitant to even make this news page live because we still don't have anything here I know there was some content all right we're gonna do the work to get this news page ready but if I can't find some good content to go in here then maybe I'll maybe I'll wait I could always put something in there that would check to see how many posts are available and maybe change this link so that when we do get posts later on it'll automatically change and link to the right page and then that way I don't have to come in and edit it I'm not sure it happened there okay let me I'm going to commit what we did with the with the video use okay all right hey we're up to nine viewers now so we're getting up there it looks like and Tawana is asking it other videos at the beginning the projects and Zanna yes there's a thanks thanks for answering Zanna yeah check out there are also a few videos of the very beginning the project are on my youtube channel in the link to that is it's also in the description for this video on I see Amelia Amelia just answered that as well so once again I forgot to look down and see so thanks Amelia yeah all right so yeah Zanna said it's the feeling when one moves one card to to the done yeah that's a good feeling to move it over to done just look at this doesn't it sleep you get to the end of the project that looks amazing like this is all that's left to do I mean I know I have all this stuff that's like if I had a lot of time I would do this but ignoring this for a minute it's just really cool it feels really good I mean look at all this stuff in the done column just really cool to have all that I mean look that's you know over well over 200 Pomodoro sessions completed really cool that feels great all right well let's just start let's start getting these done so everything that has to do with music it's ticking and yeah are we don't I'm not gonna change that yet and so we have this finished and yeah so we'll do this then we'll move on to this we'll see how much time we have and go from there and let me try to keep accurate estimates of my time so I'm currently closing in on a hundred and fifty hours of development time for this that's a kind of a rough estimate I usually underestimate a bit because that doesn't include any meetings phone calls or emails about this which there were a lot so I think this is gonna end up including all the meetings and everything this is probably going to end up being close to 200 hours of development time for this Patrick asked what Chrome extension I'm using for the Trello thing and I always forget what it is let me look actually is it this one yeah okay so it's scrum for Trello so that's the so that's scrum SCR um Patrick I'm sure you know what scrum is but in case somebody's watching it's not familiar with scrum it SCR um for Trello all right let me get my my timer went off so since there's not a lot going on in the live chat right now although now we're up to eleven viewers so we're getting not nearly as many as we normally have but we're getting there let's see also just a heads up if you see any if if you happen to watch the Instagram thing although no I don't think anyone right now and you see somebody behind me my coworkers were plotting to to get on YouTube or Instagram or something by sneaking in and and looking they're gonna have a hard time though because I did lock my doors so but that was their plot alright so let's start up another Pomodoro session let's grab an image for this I need to find I think I have I don't remember where I have all the images I think they're my Google Drive and actually I did I got an SVG version of the logo as well that if we have time I'm gonna put in there so John Hanson who's often in the live chat converted the the loge of this logo into an SVG right now it's a ping I think so he sent me that and I'm going to while I'm in my Google Drive I'm just gonna download that as well since we might be using it Knox Aven I haven't really even had a chance to check it out yet but I'm a big fan of SVG's whenever I can use them I think it will end up looking that I don't know how it looks on your screen but on my screen this just does not look crisp at all until i if i zoom in like this it looks kind of crisp but it's just it doesn't look great so what did you off to check the file sizes and everything I'm pretty sure the SVG will end up being smaller but we'll we'll check that out in a minute right now I need to find hopefully I can find the so I'll bring it over on this screen when I find it just in case I have a lot of stuff from clients in my drive so I don't want to accidentally show anything from clients that I shouldn't on YouTube that's what my my son always asked if he can like play video games on my computers and stuff when I'm when I'm logged in and I always saw him like you can you can't like you could destroy so many people's websites if you got on my computer so especially I have a lot of things in LastPass so you know he wouldn't necessarily have to know the passwords with LastPass if he could figure out how to fill in everything with like he's only seven so but he got to be careful about that let me see so I think I found the right folder all right I did so let me bring this over and let's check out some of these images all right let me see how can i I'll zoom in a bit so what page this is the news page I'll say right away this image they didn't like this image before the people in charge the catechetical Institute as there's like a header image because I don't know because some of the stuff was out they just didn't like that some things were out of focus on other things weren't out of focus which I don't really know we could do anything about that like obviously you can't have the entire picture in focus if it's you know things are in the background also depending on the screen dimensions some people's you know their heads will get will won't be visible so they didn't like that as well so I think anything with people it's probably out so we just need to look at some of these shots of campus so that limits us to these and some of them have already been used you see also things like this that have an obvious focus they're probably going to be out of the question because once again if part of it gets cut off that they don't like that so like this isn't gonna work say I'm a bit limited actually I wonder about this one I don't think we've used this one let me check quickly see if we've used this one that looks decent I know they really want to use pictures of campus because the people that are going to be using their learning management system will most likely not visit campus so they want to give them a feeling of that this really is attached to a physical campus and not like it online only school that's that's how they explain their desire to have lots of the images of campus Timmy I'm gonna go through quickly and just make sure we're not using how we are using it shoot okay so using that this is different but it really looks the same let me see if we were using this I think we are let's check it out yep we're using that one too maybe not that one but it looks pretty close it's gonna settle think it's the same one no it's not the same one unless there's things getting cut off on the size oh maybe it is the same one yeah okay yeah that is the same one I think we're using this one too let me check the courses events resources to say yep that's it I've already already picked all the ones that'll work let's see this one now I'm using this one alright so that kind of leaves this as being one of the only ones that we haven't used yet I guess I'm really hesitant to use it because in some important parts of the picture are gonna be cut off but I don't really want to spend too much time worrying about this see this one I don't know if I could get a good crop on this so that it would work I guess I might be able to let me alright let's open this in Pixlr and I want to doublecheck the dimensions that I need oh yeah XANA I am choosing a header sorry I didn't I'm in check over there look Patrick's just got a bunch of YouTube notifications all at once so maybe maybe something was happening Ren's ass how long is this going Ren's a set of five minutes ago so if you're still there ends at least this is probably gonna go till 400 maybe later we'll just see how it goes Zanna says she does this in yeah I I actually I do use like for all the the thumbnails for my videos I do those in but it's just it's really convenient for minor things to just open this in the browser and I I don't have to worry about having things downloaded and so this this works for a lot of the stuff that I normally need to do but I do like a light I actually had never used it before and then when I first started streaming for free code camp they they have do their thumbnails in so both sent me both who does the JavaScript video sent me the template file so I had to learn how to use but he was really cool about it he actually he made a tutorial video for me so that I could learn how to edit things in so that was super helpful and it was really nice of him I could even hear like his kids were in the background and stuff so he took time out of his out of this time with his family to do the tutorial so those are really good guy if you get a chance to watch this videos check them out let's see sorry my other screen I'm going through my files trying to find where my there we go where these images are so that I can figure out what I need okay it looks like I need 2,000 by 500 yeah all right so 2,000 by 500 what I need so let's adjust the image size okay so we're already at two thousand that's great now we just need to crop 500 out of here foot size okay mmm Wow all right so I guess I'll try to get this this cross this is a cool spot on campus they call it the Rosary circle so they actually have the same number of like bushes around here as there are beads on a rosary so that's kind of cool I had never knew that I had seen this for years and never realized that that's what it was until I started actually started working here but that's what it is that's kind of cool it's easier to tell like from an aerial shot than when you're actually walking around it alright I think that's that'll probably be about what we want all right so let's save this and use title know what an error card come on I don't want to save it's a Google Drive let's try to save it maybe that's why the error occurred that's kind of a really big file I if I have time I need to compress these images there's some other images on the site that I really want to cut down as well all right now let's try this out so where we had news where its title how did I have this I'm not even sure if I'm still using this maybe I am news yeah this was this is kind of a mess I really wanted to be able to just pass this in as a prop but I guess you can't do that if you're using the style JSX so so that's why I have this which seems crazy but it's because I couldn't pass it as a prop and I'm sure if I would have thought about it longer I could have figured out some way to make it work but for now that's that's just how it is let's go back here and see that's really weird why did that happen okay sometimes when I do it just does like a hot reload the styles that are in the dish style JSX tags don't get applied let's go back to our news page yeah so maybe it's not that's not where hmm then I'm not change the right spot let's see all right so yeah this is entitle the title component and C News News title okay oh I know what I didn't put it in the new folder I put it right in the image folder mmhm still not working let's make sure that this is actually called news maybe I didn't put in news okay yes I've given the ID courses here to Maine so maybe I just didn't do that for news yet there we go all right great okay so we have that section all right as I move that around that's not bad I mean this no one's gonna have a screen like this I'm not worried about it but let's maybe see how it looks on this screen okay that's I can I can live with that so on most screen dimensions you can see you can still see the cross there I think they'll be happy with that awesome so yeah that definitely took longer than I hoped it took a bit longer than the one half but some let's go ahead and commit commit to change my livestream on Instagram stopped so I did it yesterday I think Instagram has a one hour time limit it seems like because I've been streaming for one hour so good to know and yesterday I didn't realize you could do this but you can make your livestream available for 24 hours so I did do that so in case anybody does want to see it it's available it will be available for the next 24 hours so I'm trying to find my there it is my console whoa you sir okay that's our new file great all right great so that's done I'm gonna say I'm gonna just round this up and say that this did take one it almost took one or maybe yeah I didn't do a whole lot of looking at the live chat so I could could knock some time off for that but I think that took about one alright let's make news page alright so basically for this one I just want to clean up the page a little bit display what needs to be displayed this is no longer on hold let's see I want to briefly look through some of my I can't find it I had open my oh there we go my messages from my boss just to get through really quickly and see if the information that I needed was there no I don't think it is all right so I guess I could check my email quickly too if you remember I said there there was some extra information that could go here for some new posts so I want to find that but it's it's been a while yeah oh well it's not a big deal you know anyone could enter in that information from WordPress now it'll all get pulled in it's a wordpress so that'll be fun let's see we do need to check these out we need to edit these pages a bit I don't want the title to appear like this because if if you get a long title for a post it looks really weird and it extends out so it's just we're gonna change up how this the single news page works but for now I want to check out why I'm not getting the excerpt to display here and I guess it's not we don't really need it a hundred percent but usually that's something that's kind of expected all right so let's see what we're doing here okay so we're not we're not sending the excerpt in and let's see what it looks like on and WordPress all right so this is all the information I'm getting I'm putting in there in WordPress okay so this explains why we have no content because right now all we have is the excerpt and we have nothing in the actual content we also have no categories yet see which I think of the best thing to do okay let's see I'm gonna do my my short break here and check the live chat that'll give me a minute to think about what I want to do with this I'm gonna record what I did on my other screen here all right so I'm go back to the live chat Wow still only nine viewers yeah it must maybe it didn't alert people haha yeah you get Patrick must have heard the Bell the three o'clock Bell for for prayer time okay Umberto says that he never received an alert either hmm that must have been the problem then for some reason the alert did not go out that this would be this would be live so oh well I'm gonna doublecheck one more time let's see promotion promote on my channel page hmm yeah yeah all the settings are the same as I normally do mmhmm okay so Joseph said he didn't get an alert either Umberto said looking at the alert option for this channel it looks like he got reset to off that's odd did get the alert okay so when I did I did do a stream earlier on my own my own channel and Joseph said he did get that alert okay that must be it then not really sure what I can do about that maybe later on I could try to look it up see if that's happened to anyone else before so I'm not if it if it keeps happening then I'll be a little bit more worried about it but I guess it'll be not that worried if it just happens the one time okay let's sum so yes there's not there's not that much going on in the live chat so I don't I'll be right on time usually I always go over my allotted time for checking the live chat at this time I don't think I will okay I think I probably will try to end this stream at like 400 p.m. Eastern Time at the latest because my the head of my department did want to kind of just meet and have me give her like a recap of what I did with this site so I want to make sure I finish up the stream before she for she wants to do that so she actually she might be stopping by my office in a little bit for that so just to let you all know probably would be at most two hour stream all right so my thoughts were basically it doesn't even make sense to have these right now be late you know cuz right now you know the the point of these is just to be basically links with with a little bit of text to you know right here so they're not even really meant meant to be like blog post oh I just had an idea all right here's what I'm thinking so right now these link to other places mostly I think within the site some of them to external places so what if when this option was checked if this is check that it's supposed to appear on a home page only then instead of only appearing on the home page it could also appear here but when you click the link it would go to the place would that be too confusing since this is apparently a blog page I don't know maybe I shouldn't so my original thought was that if something was basically not really a blog post it was just meant to link somewhere and then this would be checked and it would only show up on the home page and not back here the problem then is that right now we only have things like that we don't have any legitimate posts yeah I think I'll just go with that so here's what's gonna here's what I'm gonna do I'll check the live chat in a second to see if anyone is kind of has any opinion on this but what I'm gonna do is at least for now I'm just gonna put some test data in here just to see how this looks and if it looked okay I'm gonna just have it so that if it's checked if this box is checked for homepage only it won't show up here and they'll just have to put in you know put in things that'll show up at some point all right so let's go into yeah we'll do it we'll go to the news page and let's see if those content render it let's go so we have this is okay see how do I have this listed excerpt I think I'm going to grab this excerpt and make it what appears here below below this date so there's just a very short description so I need to pull in I think that's probably what it is find out in a second okay all right it's not bad that's pretty good I'm not sure about the dates I don't know what do you think about how the date looks to me at Denise I need to do something with it alright I'm gonna check the live chat quickly see what you all think okay all right so looks like looks like some people are saying if I don't have any content leave these in or potentially I could just put in some message saying there's no content if there's nothing I think I'll end up doing that saying there's no content just because I think that's going to be easier than trying to change with these link I don't know maybe about the same but I just kind of don't want I don't want to make it so these link to internal pages I want to keep this as like a normal blog would function oops oh cool yeah Patrick just like this Patrick made some fireworks Foofa which a lot really cool I like that that looks really cool I'm gonna show my kids that they will love that I feel like I could spent so much time just watching that I need to like I need to minimize that quickly before I get any more distracted thanks for sharing that Patrick that was cool okay Umberto's says with the datestyle thinking maybe like a lower color loaf yeah maybe yeah let's just let's open up dev tools here and just play around a little bit see what how we can give it a look hmm Oh see okay I could do the gold color and see how that looks I think this does need some padding what is going on ha letting me to look at the live shed I know you all caught what I was doing and now I feel like an idiot because I can't tell right from left all right I think that looks a little better you seem like here that this extends beyond you know where the title is so I wanted to line those up all right I'm I'm satisfied with that I think this is one of those things right I could spend a long time like changing one pixel here and there but I don't I don't know that it would be worth it so let's use this this was a spin I think I can actually just say span I don't have any other spans here and for some reason things that I pull in from the API that the styles that are in here don't get applied to that or at least they haven't been making they're supposed to and I'm doing something wrong oops all right let's see if that works yep great all right so that works now let's take a look at this interior page and let me before I commit this I'm gonna look at the live chat just in case I missed something okay Santa's and give something like read more yeah we could have something a little link that says read more made throughout we could have that I am I don't know what do you think do you think I should have that is that necessary throughout the site anytime that there's text in red it's a link so I mean we do have at least a pattern of things in in red being links I don't let me know what you think if if I really should put a read more link you know here that people can click on okay all right so all right so maybe I should put in a read more link all right let's do that let's put a read more link in and so that would be because here we'll put a span and now I'm gonna have to do maybe I'll just I'll leave this a span or I have the same styling as the date let me see because for now I think that'll be okay so I am gonna make this a link but for now I just want to see what it looks like hmm so definitely have to let's see all right see Alex all right that's not bad what do you think whoa saying there are two live streams now for free code camp yeah I've never seen that before either let me check that out okay it looks like from the channel it looks like that though isn't live but he did put a video up yeah an hour ago okay okay so it was just delayed okay cool hey John how's it going glad you could join us and thanks for that SVG I'm gonna try to get that in if I can if I have time today I really appreciate that Blake thanks for watching I'm not sure that I've seen you in the live chat before if I if you have been in the live chat and I just didn't remember I'm sorry about that but otherwise welcome and thanks for joining in okay so it seems like the consensus is that the read more looks good so let's actually make it a link now so we can just grab this let's see all right let's see how that up and I turned it blue it's very very sad area okay so that's cool resources yep so that's working how we wanted to alright great so that looks good now now I can commit okay all right and our Pomodoro session is almost up and let's see single news page that was what we're gonna move on to let me add on let's see alright so I mean we've we have actually completed this according to what this task was but I'm just gonna lump in the changing that single news page as well I don't want them don't want to make another card I have some time left in my estimate so it's possible that I just have assumed I was gonna do that as part of this before I made this so long ago I really can't looks like I added this card to ready for development on May 10 so I do know how long ago I actually made the card let's see a short break alright I think actually so think I'm actually I'm gonna go to the live chat answer some questions and then probably I'm gonna finish up then so I don't really want to start another Pomodoro cycle and another thing because then that'll put me over the the twohour mark for this video so I do want to leave time to to wrap wrap up what I'm doing and then meet with my department head and give an overview of what all was done and I think I just got a text from my wife a few minutes ago that she has to do something at 430 yeah so I've never I'm gonna answer some questions and wrap it up and then call my wife to figure out if if that if the text she just sent me means that I need to be home very soon or what so I'm not sure with them he's but yeah let me check in the live chat here and see if I've missed anything I know there's not a whole lot of people here I'm like somewhat afraid that everybody's going to get a delayed notification for this and right when I'm about to end the stream you know everybody will join in at that point because they will have just gotten the notification so I kind of hope that doesn't happen I'd hate to bail on everybody right away all right so let me let's see what's in the chat here okay Susanna mentioned the read more link could actually make the the text like drop down and it just pushes everything else down but it would no longer up in a new post so I do I like Patrick says he likes that idea as well but so right now what will end up happening is that assuming that the people put inputting data follow what the instructions I'm gonna give them so I'm gonna make them a video to go through all of this you know how to how to update all content in WordPress and how it will look I am gonna say you know make sure if you don't have a lot of content you check the box so that it won't appear on the the news page and that way I will avoid having a page that's just mostly blank but I do want I like the idea of the accordion except I want people to be able to link directly to a blog post so especially like to share it on social media or something and for that it needs to have its own page I mean potentially it could do like some sort of like hash at the end of the URL but but then you know you still wouldn't get the data being pulled into social media properly so I think it should have its own page and just hopefully they take my advice and only make a full page you know post I'm gonna recommend that every like legitimate blog post needs to have at least 300 words that's usually when I use I used to do a lot of search engine optimization like copywriting and so like ghost blogging and things for companies and I always said like every post needs to be at least 300 words I didn't want it to appear to be like shallow content so that's that's what I'm gonna recommend okay I see as Anna says if it's a longer post it could open a new post so it could be either or I yeah I do like that idea I'm probably not gonna do it just because at this point I'm running out of time so I'll probably just keep it as is for now okay so food says awesome work Jessie thanks I appreciate that and thanks for joining in the the live chat thanks for watching Blake s what's the link for the timer it's just tomato timer comm see if I can yeah so tomato timer com tomato timer comm yeah no problem pooch says what advice would you give to someone who's learning wordpress along with code yeah that's actually kind of how I learned I would say this definitely seems to be like a wordpress way of doing things and that's I mean in terms of they have like these these hooks and everything is done through that so in terms of like how you write PHP I guess just be aware that the WordPress way of doing it isn't you know that's specific to WordPress and that isn't used everywhere so just kind of be aware of that and then I would you know when you can do projects that don't involve WordPress you know try that because there's a lot of things that WordPress does for you that if you're gonna do a project from scratch you know you need to worry about so things like like routing WordPress does that for you but you know normally if you're doing a project just from scratch with just JavaScript you'd have to come up with some sort of routing system like templating so there's just so many builtin things with WordPress that if you only stuck with WordPress you wouldn't even realize what goes into that or how to do that so that would be my advice is I think WordPress is great it lets you build nicelooking really nicelooking sites you know really functional sites without having to worry so much about all other stuff and without really having to know about backend things but if if you really want to kind of learn how everything works then I would try to do some things not in WordPress and it'll just give you a much better idea of what goes in and you will you'll actually appreciate everything that WordPress does for you so that's that's kind of my my advice and also like learn how to use some of the build tools that you would use normally on a JavaScript project that you wouldn't normally use with WordPress so I'm talking about like you know using let's say like gulp or web pack or something all from the you know learning how to use the command line using git I think those sort of things are they're not used as commonly with WordPress because you don't you can start up a wordpress site without that and you can work on it without it so it's not quite as common but I think those are important things to know so that would be my advice hopefully that helped a bit okay so John actually said it was a very delayed notification you know I'm gonna have to really be more disciplined about scheduling the time for the video earlier in the day usually what I what I've done is like I just put it off until later on and then that gives me a better idea of what I'm actually going to be working on so I can I can write a better description for the video but I think maybe it would be better to maybe my my titles and descriptions aren't quite accurate but if I were to let's say it like you know maybe 900 900 a.m. you know Eastern Time or 10 I would have the video already scheduled and it would already be notifying maybe maybe then there'd be a better chance of the notifications coming maybe when I wait till the last minute it's just you know that's causing the delay I don't really know I mean you would think that you could start the stream you know and then a minute later the notification would go out but maybe that's it so I'm gonna make a better effort to not wait until the last minute get the stream schedule and then because I usually know like as soon as I get into work I have a decent idea of whether or not I'll be able to stream at the proper time you know 2 p.m. Eastern so I should be able to schedule and if I have to change it later on that I do change it but maybe that will help okay so Patrick says that he thinks that the 300 word count for search engine optimization is outdated and it's actually longer now okay that's good to know okay Zanna says like 500 words maybe I'll recommend 500 then I think to recommend I'll go ahead and recommend about 500 I was just thinking I don't want to make it too daunting of a task for them but then on second thought I I thought you know throughout this entire process for the site I kept on saying it would be better if we had less text so I kind of think it's not really gonna be a problem for them to hit that 500 word count since they seem to be going over the amount of text that I that I think they should have in most of the other parts of the site so thanks for that I'll go with 500 words I haven't done like real SEO work in so long and that feel it changes so often that I don't really feel confident that I'm up on the latest things I'm sure there's probably some fundamental things that pretty much stay the same and I'd be good with that but I wouldn't I wouldn't say that I'm nearly as knowledgeable about current trends and SEO as I used to be used to be I used to be able to get sites to the you know right to the top of the first page and in small markets you know usually within you know within months I could I could for sure get him up I had like I had like a plan and if you just stuck to the plan you know it seemed like it always worked like I said in small markets not in like high competition places but usually like when that starts happening and you can continually consistently get sites ranked higher with the formula then things change the algorithms changed and I wasn't like spamming bad content my my philosophy and when copywriting was always yes you want to do it so you can get ranked higher but I always wanted to give users something useful to them and meaningful even if my main purpose in writing is just to get you know more to get rank higher and the search engine rankings then I still wanted to provide some benefit so I think that's really what it's about is if you provide something beneficial and substantial consistently then eventually you will rank higher as long as you're doing the fundamental things like you know you have your HTML formatted properly and things like that title tags title tags always found to be really important I assume they're still important all right Gaurav says looks good man thanks thanks I appreciate that yeah then I said I hope they won't ask you to write their content yeah it definitely won't be I don't write content anymore I'm not really it's I'm not into that so I I do not offer that service to clients anymore yeah so there's a dimension since they expect design tests from you yeah I still I do design and that's out of necessity because there's no one else that can do design but we have we have we actually have writers on staff in my department so since we have writers we have graphic designers but they just stick with print stuff mostly so and we have writers but we don't have a web designer so I end up doing the web design as well yeah John says it's hard to convince people to have good and relevant tax count on websites everyone wants to go for the minimalist whiteonwhite look yeah I mean I like minimalist in general but I do you you need to have a certain word count I think on on a page but there were some pages where I kept I wanted to keep a large font size so I'm convinced that the one of the keys to having people actually read your content is to have a decent sized font so like I'm not really comfortable going below like 18 pixels for most font sizes because it's just hard to read I mean it really it depends on your screen and how far away you are from your screen different things like that but basically like I'm way less likely to read something if the font is small and I have to like really focus on it and I have I have good vision I've good eyesight you know I'm young so I can imagine people who have difficult you know they don't have good vision or they're older like it's got to be terrible for them to try to read this small font so having said that if you're gonna go with a large font you have to cut down the amount of text otherwise it just seems like an overwhelming amount of text because you have this large font size now so I like to increase font size decrease the amount of text and then it'll be easier for people to read and there'll be less that they have to read so it's more likely that they'll read a higher percentage of the content on every page so I think that's my philosophy on things maybe I may be mistaken but see all right cool yeah so John mentioned the Meta Description tag is ignored by search engine yeah so if you're still using the Meta Description tag on your site just stop it's not used by search engines well I shouldn't say stop here's my feeling that Meta Description tag if you don't use it a search engine will just pull content from your site anyway and it'll probably be relevant and it'll match up with whatever the search term was so you can add it if you really want to specify what the description would be but it's totally not necessary so I guess it just depends on what you want I've gone back and forth on it sometimes depending on whether you know depending on what I want so if you have a certain like marketing message that you really want to appear then I guess you use use it otherwise like don't worry as much about it because the search engine will pull what they want yeah Johnson yeah thanks for clarifying yeah I didn't mean let me clarify that because I don't mean so John is rightly bringing up that it's the the meta or the keywords so like the meta keywords are not crawled like so those won't be called the description will they'll see the description another use of description but it won't count in terms of your your ranking so it's it's not like it's invisible to search engines but it won't like don't keywords stuff your description right because that's not going to do anything for you in terms of search ranking right your description in a way that's going to appeal to your users okay don't don't consider search engines when you're doing your description does that make more sense I probably shouldn't talk about SEO at all anyway since I'm not I'm not really up on it so like I said I haven't done anything with search engine optimization in probably two years so don't don't take what I say as as accurate anymore but I think it's it's been true for a long time so it's true to say don't use meta keywords if you do use the Meta Description write it to your users don't worry about search engines because they won't use that as a ranking factor the title tag is important to have the proper wording in because at least it's been my experience that the title tag is actually very important in terms of what keywords you actually rank for and your header tags alright so I'm not I'm not gonna comment any more on on search engine optimization because I I think saying less is better at this point because I don't want to mess any one site up by giving incorrect advice on on that but I'm thinking I'm gonna I'm gonna wrap up this stream thanks for watching like I said I'm gonna try to schedule the streams earlier so you all can get hopefully get the notifications on time and not late so I apologize for that I hadn't anticipated that that would happen I'm not entirely sure why it happened but just in case it was because of the timing of me starting scheduling the stream I'll try to do it earlier so tomorrow I will be back with an entirely new project I'm not exactly sure what it'll be but it'll be new so thank you so much to everyone who helped out with this project I think it turned out really well and way better with your help than it ever could have been with just me working on it I really appreciate that and yeah I think that's that's it for today's stream see tomorrow and have a great day
