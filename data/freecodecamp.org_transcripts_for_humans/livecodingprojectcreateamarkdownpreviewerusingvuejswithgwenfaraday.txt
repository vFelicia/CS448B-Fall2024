01:33 - hi everyone
01:34 - how are you
01:36 - if you don't know me my name is gwen
01:38 - and i run a youtube channel called
01:40 - faraday academy where i do mostly vue.js
01:44 - and python django content
01:46 - videos and live streams on there
01:49 - and free code camp is letting me stream
01:51 - from their channel again today now last
01:54 - week i
01:56 - built
01:57 - one of the projects
01:59 - the quote machine using basic html and
02:03 - view js
02:04 - and i received some
02:07 - um
02:08 - comments and issues and one pr from that
02:13 - so thank you for all your contributions
02:15 - so i've updated it over the last week
02:18 - and now this week i'm going to be
02:19 - working on the markdown previewer
02:23 - so here's the repo i'm just going to
02:26 - post it in the chat
02:28 - and
02:29 - you can take a look that has all the
02:31 - code from
02:33 - last week and also whatever code that i
02:36 - write from today
02:38 - so yeah if you don't know this is one of
02:40 - free code camp's projects
02:43 - there are front end projects that you
02:44 - usually build with react on their
02:46 - platform but you can really build it
02:49 - with any type of javascript framework so
02:51 - today i'm going to be using view
02:53 - and the view
02:55 - ui
02:57 - framework incline
02:59 - so it's similar to bootstrap
03:01 - it's really good for
03:03 - responsive design and it's also
03:07 - one of the simpler frameworks but still
03:09 - robust enough to have
03:11 - a grid system and a lot of the
03:13 - components that you would need so i'm
03:15 - going to be using
03:16 - this framework today
03:18 - and
03:19 - yeah let me go into the terminal
03:22 - so
03:23 - i have the main repo
03:26 - with all the different markdown preview
03:29 - quote machine and all the different
03:31 - folders in it so i'm going to go into
03:33 - the markdown
03:35 - previewer folder
03:39 - all right
03:40 - let's see
03:45 - by the way if you're here feel free to
03:46 - say hi make comments
03:48 - suggestions anything during the stream
03:52 - all right so now i have markdown
03:54 - previewer
03:56 - and
03:57 - let me see what's in here so right now
03:59 - it's just my readme and mockup so i'm
04:00 - going to create an app folder with my
04:02 - view app and today instead of html i'm
04:05 - going to be using the
04:07 - view cli
04:08 - to create this so if you go to the
04:10 - vue.js website you can just install vue
04:14 - with npm
04:16 - if you want to globally or use npx and
04:18 - then you have access to the vcli so i'm
04:21 - going to do view create
04:23 - a new app and
04:25 - what should i call this i'll call this
04:31 - markdown
04:34 - previewer
04:39 - invalid oh they can't it can't contain
04:42 - capital letters all right so
04:46 - let's see if that works all right cool
04:48 - and now it's taking me through asking me
04:51 - what options i want to install so i'm
04:53 - just going to do the default
04:55 - because i'm not going to need routing
04:56 - and state management and stuff
05:01 - all right
05:03 - so that's installing
05:08 - it'll take a minute
05:12 - and then i'll open this up in a code
05:14 - editor
05:16 - let me go ahead and pull up the ink line
05:18 - getting started
05:22 - so
05:23 - these are all the ways that i can
05:24 - install it the vcli that should be the
05:27 - easiest so i'm just going to add this as
05:29 - a plug-in
05:30 - right after i finish installing
05:38 - all right
05:39 - i don't know if i'm seeing the chat have
05:41 - there been any chat messages
05:43 - let me see
05:46 - i guess not okay
05:50 - so i move the
05:54 - oh
05:56 - that's weird
05:58 - i didn't realize it would follow me
06:00 - around on different screens that's
06:01 - interesting
06:04 - all right
06:20 - installing packages
06:23 - oh and the markdown library i looked at
06:27 - a couple just to see which ones were
06:29 - updated the markdown library that i'm
06:31 - going to use is
06:33 - view markdown
06:36 - the last update was about a year and a
06:38 - half ago but it
06:40 - seems to still
06:42 - be working well and it has a live demo
06:44 - so this is the one i'm going to install
06:46 - and use
06:49 - all right cool
06:50 - so now i have the folder
06:53 - markdown previewer
06:55 - and i'll go in there
06:57 - okay now i'm in my folder and let me
06:59 - open my code editor
07:04 - okay
07:06 - so
07:08 - let's see
07:12 - okay so now i have a new vue.js
07:15 - application
07:16 - with the hello world let me run this
07:18 - first actually so let me do npm
07:22 - run
07:23 - serve
07:26 - and then
07:27 - i can open it up in the browser
07:30 - localhost
07:31 - 8080.
07:36 - okay cool so that's working now i'm
07:38 - going to have to stop the server because
07:40 - i want to add incline
07:42 - so i'm going to copy this
07:45 - and
07:47 - stop the server and view add incline
07:53 - there are uncommitted changes yes i
07:55 - still want to proceed
07:57 - because i haven't done anything to the
07:58 - repo yet
08:04 - okay
08:08 - so i'm installing incline
08:14 - and the next thing i want to install
08:16 - before i rerun the server is view
08:18 - markdown
08:19 - so i'm going to go ahead and get the
08:22 - install for this
08:24 - npm install
08:27 - view markdown all right
08:53 - oh i don't know why it's showing this
08:55 - other screen
08:57 - um
08:59 - i was trying to see if
09:00 - there was chat but that's okay
09:03 - um
09:05 - i'll just be talking to myself let's see
09:08 - markdown preview okay so that installed
09:12 - and now i'll do
09:15 - um
09:17 - let's see
09:20 - oh yeah let me run the server again
09:28 - and
09:32 - it's building it's building
09:39 - there you go
09:46 - there we go
09:49 - all right
09:51 - so now i'm going to start setting up the
09:54 - component
09:56 - so in my
09:57 - um if i go into a markdown previewer in
10:00 - that repo
10:01 - i have just a basic um
10:06 - yeah just a basic like side by side
10:08 - right mark down and see the preview on
10:11 - the other side
10:13 - and this is actually i looked back at my
10:15 - old free code camp projects from five
10:18 - years ago and this is the exact same
10:19 - thing that i built in react five years
10:22 - ago so i just borrowed the same
10:25 - design basically for this one
10:27 - so
10:29 - let me go
10:31 - to
10:32 - incline actually and i'm going to set up
10:34 - the grid system for the page
10:37 - so
10:38 - this is exactly um
10:40 - like bootstrap column wise
10:43 - so it has 12 columns and everything
10:47 - and let me just
10:53 - okay let me just take
10:56 - the grid
10:59 - all of the components for inkline are
11:00 - wrapped in i
11:02 - so
11:03 - it's just like most other view
11:05 - frameworks
11:07 - like beautify is v dash container
11:09 - element is e dash container and
11:12 - incline is i dash container
11:14 - all right
11:15 - so
11:17 - let me actually copy all of this the
11:20 - container row and column
11:23 - and
11:24 - i'll go to the app component
11:27 - now i'm going to delete everything
11:29 - that's in there
11:31 - and
11:32 - i'm also going to
11:35 - delete hello world
11:38 - delete the component
11:40 - and delete all of this styling that i'm
11:43 - not going to need
11:46 - all right so in here
11:49 - let me
11:53 - do oops do an eye container
11:57 - i row
12:02 - and let me close the container
12:06 - okay
12:07 - so
12:08 - now i have a row and in this row i want
12:10 - to have two columns
12:13 - because i want a column for
12:15 - this big text field where i input the
12:18 - markdown and the formatted text on the
12:20 - other side
12:21 - so let me go ahead and add that
12:26 - so
12:26 - [Music]
12:28 - um yeah a different column so
12:30 - i'll do
12:31 - actually i'll just copy that
12:37 - okay so now i have two columns and
12:39 - inside of the first column
12:42 - and actually i don't want these to be
12:45 - full width so this is taking up all 12
12:47 - columns so i'm going to put from small
12:49 - screen size up
12:52 - let's see to take up six columns
12:56 - all right and then the same thing on
12:57 - this one so
12:59 - for small
13:01 - and then i'll take up
13:02 - six columns
13:06 - all right
13:09 - cool and now inside of the first one let
13:11 - me find a text area
13:13 - in incline so let me look for
13:16 - text
13:19 - area
13:22 - all right
13:26 - sure why it's not closing there we go
13:29 - so clearable text disabled i just want
13:31 - the basic text area let me grab this one
13:33 - and eventually i'll set a height on it
13:36 - um
13:38 - okay let me grab
13:39 - that
13:42 - and then
13:44 - basically just need to remodel it
13:47 - somewhere
13:50 - so
13:51 - let's see v model to value so i need to
13:54 - create a value
13:56 - so let me add a value variable
13:58 - in
13:59 - data
14:01 - too much
14:03 - okay so let me add
14:05 - data function
14:07 - and return
14:09 - the data variable which will be an empty
14:12 - string to start with
14:15 - and
14:17 - put that on separate lines make it a
14:18 - little bit nicer
14:24 - okay
14:26 - um
14:27 - let's
14:28 - see going to put enter
14:32 - mark down here
14:36 - and it models to the value
14:39 - which
14:40 - oh i accidentally put data there let me
14:42 - put
14:43 - let me actually put text
14:49 - there so now it's text
14:53 - and
14:54 - let me check see if that's working
14:58 - okay cool
14:59 - so i can enter something here
15:02 - and then in my view dev tools
15:06 - i should be able to see
15:10 - the text here
15:14 - a container i row i column
15:18 - i text okay so in the app component i
15:20 - can see
15:22 - the let me move my face
15:26 - i can see the
15:28 - data is equal to whatever i type in it's
15:31 - mapping
15:34 - okay so the two-way data binding is
15:36 - working
15:38 - and
15:39 - now i need to put
15:41 - some kind of a margin top
15:44 - to
15:44 - bring this down and also a vertical
15:47 - divider in between both columns
15:51 - um it's already giving me because i'm
15:53 - using the container element
15:55 - um
15:58 - it's already giving me a nice
16:01 - let's see
16:03 - container yeah it's giving me a really
16:05 - nice margin on the outside
16:07 - so i just need that same margin on the
16:09 - top really
16:11 - so let me
16:12 - add that
16:15 - on the container
16:18 - i'm going to add a class and let me just
16:20 - look
16:21 - in ink line
16:24 - what the spacing
16:26 - actually i'll search for it let me see
16:28 - if they have spacing
16:30 - oops
16:31 - spacing or margin
16:37 - okay so it has sas sas variables that i
16:39 - can use
16:43 - um
16:45 - sas variables for spacing
16:50 - okay
16:53 - now i wonder if i put sas and oh no i
16:56 - didn't actually
16:58 - install sas with this app that's fine
17:00 - i'll add my own spacing in that case
17:04 - because when i set up the vcli i just
17:06 - set up
17:07 - the
17:08 - default
17:10 - so there's just
17:12 - linting and stuff basically
17:15 - so let me do style
17:19 - and
17:22 - i'll give this a class
17:24 - of
17:26 - i guess i'll just call it container
17:30 - and i'm going to style that container so
17:35 - style the container
17:37 - as
17:40 - margin top
17:41 - of
17:42 - 40 pixels
17:49 - okay
17:50 - that adds some margin top and then i'm
17:53 - going to add a title here
17:56 - so
17:58 - i can't remember what i did on the
17:59 - mock-ups
18:01 - i think oh i just said markdown okay
18:04 - let me add that title then
18:06 - it'll be in the same column right above
18:08 - the text area so
18:10 - i'll do h1
18:13 - mark down
18:18 - okay i think that looks pretty good
18:22 - and now i have
18:24 - this and now let me add the vertical
18:26 - line here
18:28 - so
18:30 - let's see if it has a
18:32 - vertical line
18:37 - vertical
18:44 - vertical grid flex
18:48 - okay
18:49 - well i guess not
18:52 - so that's fine
18:55 - um i guess i'll add that later let me
18:57 - then
18:58 - just
18:59 - copy
19:01 - this
19:02 - title and then i'll put
19:08 - formatted
19:10 - formatted text here
19:15 - okay
19:16 - so that's fine and then i'll add
19:19 - i guess a border to one of the
19:23 - one of the sides
19:25 - and
19:26 - hope that it's even
19:28 - let's see
19:30 - in the column so i should add it to the
19:32 - column i guess
19:34 - so if i add a border here
19:37 - let me just try it out in the browser
19:40 - so
19:41 - let me move
19:43 - one second
19:46 - let me
19:48 - wonder if i can
19:50 - oh there we go
19:52 - all right
19:53 - so let me add
19:55 - a border
19:58 - right
20:00 - of
20:02 - one pixel solid
20:05 - okay i think that looks pretty good
20:08 - because of the padding
20:10 - that the
20:12 - um
20:15 - that the columns are giving me so it's
20:18 - pushing it
20:19 - it's giving it the same amount of
20:20 - padding pretty much on either side i
20:22 - think so
20:24 - okay so now i have to add that here
20:28 - and so let me add
20:30 - for column here let me add a custom
20:32 - class i'll just call it column
20:36 - and then down here
20:39 - i'm going to add
20:41 - dot
20:42 - column
20:45 - and i'll say
20:47 - does it border
20:50 - right
20:51 - of
20:54 - one pixel solid
20:57 - oh yeah
20:58 - semicolon there
21:00 - okay and that should default to black
21:02 - oh no
21:03 - okay so
21:06 - i think
21:08 - um
21:10 - so this must have the same class of
21:12 - column because it's giving me two
21:15 - so i thought maybe
21:17 - incline would give it a class of i
21:18 - column or something
21:21 - but no it's just column
21:23 - uh which is fine
21:25 - so let me give it
21:27 - i'll just call it custom
21:29 - no no let me call it something what i'm
21:31 - actually doing with it let me call it
21:35 - border right
21:37 - and then i'll
21:38 - update this down here to
21:42 - border right
21:46 - all right
21:50 - okay cool so now it has the border let
21:52 - me set a height on this then
21:54 - on the input
21:57 - so let me go back to text
22:00 - text area
22:03 - and i'll search for height
22:06 - nope
22:08 - um so i might have to just set the
22:10 - height attribute
22:13 - sizes this is just setting the text
22:15 - sizes
22:20 - um
22:21 - yeah it doesn't seem like they have a
22:24 - prop they accept a prop for height so i
22:26 - guess that's just styling
22:28 - which makes sense
22:30 - so
22:32 - i text area
22:34 - um let me put
22:37 - a class here
22:40 - which
22:42 - will be
22:46 - text area
22:50 - um
22:55 - or i'll call it text area height
22:59 - all right so here i'll do
23:02 - a class text area
23:05 - height
23:07 - and then
23:09 - let me say height
23:12 - is
23:14 - i don't know 400 pixels let's see what
23:16 - that looks like
23:18 - oh wait that didn't save
23:22 - um oh wait i
23:24 - made a typo there
23:28 - okay
23:31 - so
23:34 - 400 pixels well that changed the
23:37 - vertical line but it didn't really
23:39 - change
23:40 - um
23:42 - this
23:45 - the text area
23:46 - so i wonder if i just pass
23:48 - in let me see
23:51 - let me edit the
23:53 - html here
23:55 - so if i just say height
23:57 - directly inside the element
23:59 - i think i can do 400
24:04 - nope
24:06 - because it's draggable but
24:08 - i'd rather just have the height
24:10 - i might have to
24:12 - oh that's kind of cool
24:14 - you can just drag it doesn't expand past
24:16 - its container good
24:19 - so
24:20 - let me look up real quick text
24:22 - setting text area height
24:35 - should i size text area
24:37 - so it seems like you can just do width
24:39 - and height
24:46 - um
24:50 - yeah why can't i use width and height am
24:52 - i doing this wrong
24:53 - you have 400 pixels
24:56 - and let me just do a text area class
24:58 - because
25:00 - text area height as a class seems weird
25:04 - okay so i have i text area
25:07 - and now let me
25:10 - refresh
25:12 - okay well it's not changing the height
25:16 - um i can try one more thing
25:18 - otherwise i'll just
25:20 - move on
25:21 - um
25:23 - let me try setting height directly here
25:27 - because maybe it's just an undocumented
25:29 - api i don't know
25:33 - okay no that didn't work get rid of that
25:35 - all right so i'll just leave that alone
25:37 - for now then
25:39 - and figure out how to do that later
25:43 - anyway so
25:45 - i have
25:47 - the text
25:48 - from here
25:50 - and now i need to
25:52 - get the mark
25:53 - or turn it into formatted markdown on
25:56 - this side
25:57 - so
25:58 - let me
26:00 - um
26:01 - so i already installed the markdown
26:03 - library
26:04 - so
26:06 - actually i need to
26:07 - pull in the component
26:09 - so let me just look at the markdown
26:11 - library
26:14 - okay so i just import it import the
26:16 - component and then register it as a
26:18 - component so
26:19 - let me copy that
26:22 - um
26:25 - and then
26:26 - oops
26:28 - so in script
26:30 - i'll import markdown and then here
26:34 - i can register
26:37 - view
26:40 - markdown
26:43 - okay
26:47 - cool and then it's basically
26:51 - saying to pass in the
26:53 - markdown text into
26:56 - the component so into the default slot
26:59 - so i'll just copy this
27:01 - and put it
27:02 - right here
27:05 - okay first let me see if this displays
27:08 - on the page
27:11 - so
27:13 - let's see
27:14 - can't resolve
27:16 - uh
27:18 - bamboo one time
27:20 - that's interesting
27:23 - bevel doesn't seem to have anything to
27:24 - do with this
27:27 - markdown previewer
27:30 - let me see
27:32 - yeah it's just saying to install view
27:33 - markdown
27:39 - and
27:40 - nothing else okay let me look in the
27:42 - issues
27:43 - um what is it saying module not found
27:46 - error can't resolve babel runtime
27:49 - core
27:50 - get iterator
27:53 - okay
27:54 - so
27:55 - let me copy this real quick
27:58 - and
28:04 - here
28:05 - nope
28:07 - let me see
28:13 - um
28:14 - module not found
28:16 - let me see what it is in the terminal
28:20 - these dependencies were not found
28:24 - babble runtime all right
28:27 - let me try typing that in so these
28:31 - dependency or let me just type in babel
28:34 - babble
28:36 - run time
28:39 - cannot find module battle runtime all
28:42 - right
28:50 - this is
28:52 - electron but that's i mean that's the
28:54 - same error i'm getting
28:58 - delete node modules didn't seem to work
29:00 - for people
29:02 - um
29:09 - this is a popular answer npm install
29:11 - save deb
29:15 - let's see
29:16 - yeah i guess that makes sense
29:18 - install babel runtime and i wonder why
29:20 - they wouldn't list it as a dependency
29:22 - they had to install
29:24 - um let me let me install that
29:28 - i guess i'll install it as a regular
29:29 - dependency if this library is going to
29:32 - need it all the time
29:34 - so let me see
29:36 - if i install babel
29:38 - runtime
29:48 - all right
29:57 - installing
29:58 - all right now let me try running
30:01 - the dev server again
30:19 - um all right
30:29 - still
30:29 - [Music]
30:31 - okay
30:32 - let's see if that works
30:36 - okay sweet so
30:39 - this is good
30:40 - it's showing
30:41 - the markdown that i passed in here
30:44 - of course it's not real markdown let me
30:46 - write something in markdown and see let
30:49 - me just make this text bold
30:52 - so now the default should be bold
30:56 - and it's not bold
30:59 - okay it's bold now i had to refresh
31:03 - um all right cool
31:04 - so
31:05 - the markdown is working now i just have
31:07 - to get
31:08 - this text inside of this
31:11 - markdown field
31:13 - so
31:14 - let me just
31:16 - see if i can pass in the v model
31:22 - so
31:24 - my text variable
31:33 - and it doesn't seem to be
31:36 - updating so let me set a default text
31:39 - here and see if that works
31:42 - let me do
31:44 - hello
31:46 - there
31:52 - okay cool
31:58 - oh yeah oh yeah that's right i was like
32:00 - how did i tip it in there because it's v
32:02 - modeling to text
32:04 - okay so i think it just doesn't update
32:07 - as i'm typing it's not
32:10 - um
32:12 - the v model should be updating so
32:15 - let me look let me make sure that v
32:17 - model is updating my view dev tools
32:21 - in my app component
32:22 - yeah so the v model is updating my data
32:25 - my text variable
32:27 - is updating but
32:29 - it's not showing new output here
32:32 - so i wonder how i can get it to
32:34 - re-render
32:36 - where's my library
32:38 - let's see
32:43 - i'm guessing
32:45 - there's something here about
32:46 - re-rendering
32:48 - the disk folder contains
32:50 - view
32:52 - okay
32:55 - um
33:01 - okay i think this is it
33:04 - watches
33:05 - which is an array
33:08 - html refresh automatically when the prop
33:10 - in this array changes
33:13 - okay i think this is what i want then
33:16 - let me just see
33:21 - source
33:28 - i wonder so i think instead of
33:31 - um
33:33 - using a default slot maybe i can pass in
33:38 - the string as source
33:43 - but in slots i could probably do things
33:45 - like emojis
33:48 - i'm not sure actually let me just see
33:51 - with watches let me pass an array to it
33:54 - so
33:55 - let me go
33:58 - let's see
34:02 - let me go to
34:06 - my mark down
34:09 - put this on two lines
34:14 - and
34:16 - watches equals
34:19 - oh one second
34:23 - um
34:42 - okay
34:43 - cool so that worked
34:46 - um i just wanted to fix the display but
34:50 - i think that zoomed in a little bit too
34:54 - okay
34:55 - so
34:56 - now let me come back to watches
34:58 - and
35:01 - um oh wait i need to
35:05 - pass an array here so this should be
35:07 - javascript
35:08 - oops
35:10 - and
35:13 - i
35:14 - think the syntax
35:18 - is
35:21 - all right so let's see if this works
35:24 - let me
35:26 - pass in text
35:30 - and
35:34 - let me refresh
35:39 - nope it doesn't work so
35:42 - the syntax must be
35:44 - let me just see so i'm passing in
35:47 - this prop
35:49 - watches to text so when the text
35:52 - variable changes the html should
35:53 - re-render
35:55 - but it's not
35:59 - so
36:00 - let's see what am i doing wrong
36:04 - enable html syntax okay so these are all
36:07 - defaulted to true
36:10 - anyway um
36:19 - dispatch when render finishes these are
36:22 - the
36:24 - events so i don't want to watch for the
36:27 - events
36:29 - um
36:30 - let me see
36:33 - well let me see if they have yeah they
36:35 - have an example folder
36:37 - so let me go into the example of
36:40 - index.html
36:43 - and
36:45 - okay yeah so instead of the slot
36:48 - they're passing in the string as source
36:50 - let me zoom in here
36:52 - the passing in the string is source
36:56 - um
36:59 - anchor
37:00 - [Music]
37:03 - oh here okay so they have like
37:06 - four different examples here oh they
37:09 - have a lot of different examples
37:13 - um
37:16 - okay
37:23 - let's see
37:25 - set interval
37:28 - mounted this dot source
37:32 - um
37:36 - but this i think
37:38 - oh
37:42 - so this set interval i think
37:46 - is telling it
37:48 - it's updating this dot source every time
37:53 - um
37:54 - so i wonder if i put it if i pass it in
37:57 - as source if it's going to watch for
37:58 - changes
37:59 - let me try that
38:02 - let me
38:03 - get rid of that
38:05 - and watches
38:09 - and then do source
38:11 - as text
38:12 - and then i'm gonna
38:14 - um
38:15 - find that if you find that
38:18 - okay so now let's see if that's watching
38:20 - for changes i don't know
38:26 - yeah sweet okay
38:28 - cool
38:30 - that was easy so now if i press enter
38:34 - enter and let me do
38:37 - header oh cool
38:38 - awesome that wasn't too bad
38:41 - header 2
38:45 - and then i can do
38:46 - [Music]
38:47 - a
38:48 - checklist
38:54 - awesome
38:55 - it's
38:56 - completely functional
38:59 - um markdown
39:01 - sweet that wasn't too bad
39:04 - um
39:07 - let's see
39:09 - what could i change yeah in the mock-ups
39:13 - for some reason i thought maybe i'm
39:14 - gonna want to click format manually but
39:17 - actually i think this is good
39:19 - that it just automatically updates and
39:22 - previews that's much better than
39:23 - clicking a button
39:25 - okay cool so
39:27 - um let me just see if i can
39:29 - [Music]
39:31 - get this
39:33 - to set a height
39:35 - for some reason i'm not
39:37 - sure okay style height
39:45 - is changing as i drag it the style
39:48 - height
39:49 - so
39:53 - i wonder because when i search for
39:55 - height here on text area it just doesn't
39:56 - say anything about setting the height
40:00 - even in the examples
40:04 - oops
40:05 - did i do something
40:08 - okay
40:08 - my screen just went funny all right so
40:12 - even in the examples
40:14 - i don't know why i'm caught up on the
40:15 - height of it
40:17 - text field so i felt i feel like i
40:19 - should be able to just set it
40:21 - well here i mean it's setting it on
40:22 - style
40:24 - so
40:26 - i have a class of text area so
40:31 - um
40:35 - let's let me see if i can set
40:39 - height
40:40 - i have 400 pixels here
40:43 - um
40:44 - i wonder if that's being overwritten by
40:48 - um
40:51 - incline though
40:52 - by the incline framework
40:55 - this is so weird
40:59 - let me try putting a regular text area
41:01 - just outside of the container
41:04 - i'm going to say text
41:06 - text area
41:08 - and
41:12 - yeah just a plain text area oh let me
41:15 - give it a class
41:17 - let's say class of
41:20 - text area
41:30 - where is it yeah this one this regular
41:32 - plain text area
41:34 - i have is
41:36 - 400 pixels so it's something about
41:39 - um incline
41:41 - that's
41:43 - not accepting that class
41:46 - um let me try
41:48 - one more thing let me try to use a class
41:50 - that
41:52 - they're already oh i guess they aren't
41:54 - assigning a class to it
42:03 - oh because form input so there's a
42:06 - wrapper class
42:08 - around it
42:09 - they wrap it in form input group
42:13 - and then they wrap it in form input
42:16 - so let me try to change the height of
42:18 - one of the other ones
42:22 - oh
42:24 - let me try to change this one
42:28 - okay so if i change apparently so if i
42:30 - change form input
42:32 - the wrapper around
42:34 - text area
42:35 - [Music]
42:36 - that should be good
42:38 - so let me
42:40 - access
42:42 - or reference the form input class
42:45 - uh
42:47 - and
42:48 - i'll get rid of this extra class
42:52 - okay
42:53 - let me see if that works
42:56 - it still doesn't work
42:59 - form input
43:01 - so i think i need to
43:05 - um
43:06 - i'm going to try one more thing so
43:09 - is this
43:10 - set this as a module
43:13 - uh
43:13 - [Music]
43:14 - no i can't remember
43:16 - so there was something that you could do
43:21 - for dynamically updated classes
43:25 - actually i wonder if incline takes a set
43:27 - of classes that you can pass in
43:30 - let me search
43:33 - nope they don't have anything about
43:35 - classes here so i guess
43:38 - the only thing with incline is to
43:44 - um
43:46 - yeah basically update the sas variables
43:51 - which
43:52 - i don't have sas in my application
43:55 - although
43:58 - i did
43:59 - yeah when i
44:01 - i'm importing all of the sas
44:04 - variables here and registering the
44:05 - components and everything
44:10 - um okay
44:12 - so
44:15 - let me think
44:18 - i think there's so there's something in
44:21 - view
44:22 - for css
44:24 - and i think it's called
44:26 - module
44:29 - view css module in component
44:36 - uh it's been so long since i used this
44:41 - um
44:45 - maybe it wasn't called module
44:55 - let's see
44:56 - so i'm looking for the style tag
45:02 - yeah it is called module okay
45:08 - css modules
45:12 - then add the module attribute
45:15 - okay then it should be available
45:19 - on
45:20 - this
45:21 - let me zoom in it should be available
45:23 - now on the dollar sign style
45:26 - i wonder if that's going to change in v3
45:30 - let me try that so
45:33 - this style tag is scoped so i'm going to
45:35 - add another style tag
45:38 - that i will put as a module
45:41 - oops
45:42 - so style
45:46 - um
45:49 - mod
45:50 - module
45:53 - and
45:55 - close it
45:57 - and now
45:58 - let me take
46:02 - this
46:04 - and here i'm going to put
46:07 - text
46:08 - area
46:11 - and height of 400 pixels okay let me
46:14 - just make sure
46:15 - they're defining it as a class
46:21 - yeah they are they're defining it as a
46:22 - class
46:23 - so let me
46:27 - um try that
46:30 - let me now go to text area
46:34 - and do class
46:37 - equals
46:41 - style
46:42 - dot
46:43 - text
46:45 - area
46:48 - and actually i'm thinking
46:50 - this might not work because i'm passing
46:53 - this into incline and i don't know which
46:55 - of the three
46:57 - dom elements it renders are going to get
46:59 - that class
47:01 - i have no idea
47:05 - all right so let me try
47:10 - yeah i think it's giving the class to a
47:12 - different element
47:15 - which is
47:19 - let's see
47:22 - app text area yeah it's giving the class
47:25 - to the parent element
47:27 - not to the child
47:29 - elements so this form input group is
47:31 - getting the class but i need it on form
47:33 - input
47:34 - um
47:37 - all right i guess the only other thing i
47:38 - can try is
47:41 - to see if someone else has had this
47:43 - issue
47:45 - on incline
47:47 - let's see text area
47:52 - height
48:01 - and nobody nobody nobody
48:06 - nobody's even said anything about text
48:09 - area
48:10 - all right so that's something that
48:13 - i will have to
48:15 - figure out after the stream or if
48:17 - someone has a recommendation then you
48:18 - can let me know about it
48:23 - oh well
48:27 - um yeah so i think
48:30 - this is pretty much it
48:32 - um
48:37 - if there are no comments in the chat
48:38 - then i think i'll just go ahead and push
48:40 - this code
48:42 - and
48:44 - yeah
48:45 - let me stop the
48:47 - view server
48:50 - let me do git
48:52 - status
48:55 - um
48:56 - markdown previewer oh right right so
49:00 - when i created a
49:03 - generated a view project
49:07 - in
49:08 - this directory
49:11 - um
49:13 - oh i thought it created a new git
49:16 - for me but i guess it didn't because the
49:18 - parent has a get directory as a git
49:20 - project already so let me
49:22 - go up
49:25 - and up
49:27 - to my free code camp projects and i'll
49:29 - do git status
49:31 - git add this new project that i have
49:35 - commit
49:39 - code
49:41 - from live stream on
49:44 - june
49:46 - 25th
49:48 - for
49:49 - markdown
49:50 - previewer
49:56 - okay that looks good now i'll push it
50:06 - okay
50:08 - and
50:11 - sweet so now i have the
50:13 - markdown previewer code
50:15 - from today
50:19 - all right so if there are no
50:21 - comments or chat messages
50:23 - it was a very quiet day next week i'll
50:26 - be building the drum machine
50:29 - at the same time if you want to tune in
50:31 - for that
50:33 - and yeah feel free to
50:35 - make a comment raise an issue
50:38 - on this repo and yeah give me feedback
50:42 - or whatever i'll be doing the view cli
50:44 - again for
50:46 - the
50:46 - [Music]
50:47 - drum machine next week
50:49 - and then for i guess the rest of the
50:52 - free code camp projects they get a
50:54 - little bit
50:56 - more complicated with each one so i'll
50:58 - start adding in other things like
51:01 - view router view x and maybe even by the
51:03 - end of this view three will will come
51:05 - out so then i can do something with v3
51:08 - yeah so thanks for watching everyone if
51:11 - you were snooping and watching i can't
51:13 - see
51:14 - who's watching or anything but
51:16 - i hope you enjoyed this got something
51:18 - out of it uh don't forget to check out
51:19 - my channel faraday academy and have a
51:23 - great day everybody take care

Cleaned transcript:

hi everyone how are you if you don't know me my name is gwen and i run a youtube channel called faraday academy where i do mostly vue.js and python django content videos and live streams on there and free code camp is letting me stream from their channel again today now last week i built one of the projects the quote machine using basic html and view js and i received some um comments and issues and one pr from that so thank you for all your contributions so i've updated it over the last week and now this week i'm going to be working on the markdown previewer so here's the repo i'm just going to post it in the chat and you can take a look that has all the code from last week and also whatever code that i write from today so yeah if you don't know this is one of free code camp's projects there are front end projects that you usually build with react on their platform but you can really build it with any type of javascript framework so today i'm going to be using view and the view ui framework incline so it's similar to bootstrap it's really good for responsive design and it's also one of the simpler frameworks but still robust enough to have a grid system and a lot of the components that you would need so i'm going to be using this framework today and yeah let me go into the terminal so i have the main repo with all the different markdown preview quote machine and all the different folders in it so i'm going to go into the markdown previewer folder all right let's see by the way if you're here feel free to say hi make comments suggestions anything during the stream all right so now i have markdown previewer and let me see what's in here so right now it's just my readme and mockup so i'm going to create an app folder with my view app and today instead of html i'm going to be using the view cli to create this so if you go to the vue.js website you can just install vue with npm if you want to globally or use npx and then you have access to the vcli so i'm going to do view create a new app and what should i call this i'll call this markdown previewer invalid oh they can't it can't contain capital letters all right so let's see if that works all right cool and now it's taking me through asking me what options i want to install so i'm just going to do the default because i'm not going to need routing and state management and stuff all right so that's installing it'll take a minute and then i'll open this up in a code editor let me go ahead and pull up the ink line getting started so these are all the ways that i can install it the vcli that should be the easiest so i'm just going to add this as a plugin right after i finish installing all right i don't know if i'm seeing the chat have there been any chat messages let me see i guess not okay so i move the oh that's weird i didn't realize it would follow me around on different screens that's interesting all right installing packages oh and the markdown library i looked at a couple just to see which ones were updated the markdown library that i'm going to use is view markdown the last update was about a year and a half ago but it seems to still be working well and it has a live demo so this is the one i'm going to install and use all right cool so now i have the folder markdown previewer and i'll go in there okay now i'm in my folder and let me open my code editor okay so let's see okay so now i have a new vue.js application with the hello world let me run this first actually so let me do npm run serve and then i can open it up in the browser localhost 8080. okay cool so that's working now i'm going to have to stop the server because i want to add incline so i'm going to copy this and stop the server and view add incline there are uncommitted changes yes i still want to proceed because i haven't done anything to the repo yet okay so i'm installing incline and the next thing i want to install before i rerun the server is view markdown so i'm going to go ahead and get the install for this npm install view markdown all right oh i don't know why it's showing this other screen um i was trying to see if there was chat but that's okay um i'll just be talking to myself let's see markdown preview okay so that installed and now i'll do um let's see oh yeah let me run the server again and it's building it's building there you go there we go all right so now i'm going to start setting up the component so in my um if i go into a markdown previewer in that repo i have just a basic um yeah just a basic like side by side right mark down and see the preview on the other side and this is actually i looked back at my old free code camp projects from five years ago and this is the exact same thing that i built in react five years ago so i just borrowed the same design basically for this one so let me go to incline actually and i'm going to set up the grid system for the page so this is exactly um like bootstrap column wise so it has 12 columns and everything and let me just okay let me just take the grid all of the components for inkline are wrapped in i so it's just like most other view frameworks like beautify is v dash container element is e dash container and incline is i dash container all right so let me actually copy all of this the container row and column and i'll go to the app component now i'm going to delete everything that's in there and i'm also going to delete hello world delete the component and delete all of this styling that i'm not going to need all right so in here let me do oops do an eye container i row and let me close the container okay so now i have a row and in this row i want to have two columns because i want a column for this big text field where i input the markdown and the formatted text on the other side so let me go ahead and add that so um yeah a different column so i'll do actually i'll just copy that okay so now i have two columns and inside of the first column and actually i don't want these to be full width so this is taking up all 12 columns so i'm going to put from small screen size up let's see to take up six columns all right and then the same thing on this one so for small and then i'll take up six columns all right cool and now inside of the first one let me find a text area in incline so let me look for text area all right sure why it's not closing there we go so clearable text disabled i just want the basic text area let me grab this one and eventually i'll set a height on it um okay let me grab that and then basically just need to remodel it somewhere so let's see v model to value so i need to create a value so let me add a value variable in data too much okay so let me add data function and return the data variable which will be an empty string to start with and put that on separate lines make it a little bit nicer okay um let's see going to put enter mark down here and it models to the value which oh i accidentally put data there let me put let me actually put text there so now it's text and let me check see if that's working okay cool so i can enter something here and then in my view dev tools i should be able to see the text here a container i row i column i text okay so in the app component i can see the let me move my face i can see the data is equal to whatever i type in it's mapping okay so the twoway data binding is working and now i need to put some kind of a margin top to bring this down and also a vertical divider in between both columns um it's already giving me because i'm using the container element um it's already giving me a nice let's see container yeah it's giving me a really nice margin on the outside so i just need that same margin on the top really so let me add that on the container i'm going to add a class and let me just look in ink line what the spacing actually i'll search for it let me see if they have spacing oops spacing or margin okay so it has sas sas variables that i can use um sas variables for spacing okay now i wonder if i put sas and oh no i didn't actually install sas with this app that's fine i'll add my own spacing in that case because when i set up the vcli i just set up the default so there's just linting and stuff basically so let me do style and i'll give this a class of i guess i'll just call it container and i'm going to style that container so style the container as margin top of 40 pixels okay that adds some margin top and then i'm going to add a title here so i can't remember what i did on the mockups i think oh i just said markdown okay let me add that title then it'll be in the same column right above the text area so i'll do h1 mark down okay i think that looks pretty good and now i have this and now let me add the vertical line here so let's see if it has a vertical line vertical vertical grid flex okay well i guess not so that's fine um i guess i'll add that later let me then just copy this title and then i'll put formatted formatted text here okay so that's fine and then i'll add i guess a border to one of the one of the sides and hope that it's even let's see in the column so i should add it to the column i guess so if i add a border here let me just try it out in the browser so let me move one second let me wonder if i can oh there we go all right so let me add a border right of one pixel solid okay i think that looks pretty good because of the padding that the um that the columns are giving me so it's pushing it it's giving it the same amount of padding pretty much on either side i think so okay so now i have to add that here and so let me add for column here let me add a custom class i'll just call it column and then down here i'm going to add dot column and i'll say does it border right of one pixel solid oh yeah semicolon there okay and that should default to black oh no okay so i think um so this must have the same class of column because it's giving me two so i thought maybe incline would give it a class of i column or something but no it's just column uh which is fine so let me give it i'll just call it custom no no let me call it something what i'm actually doing with it let me call it border right and then i'll update this down here to border right all right okay cool so now it has the border let me set a height on this then on the input so let me go back to text text area and i'll search for height nope um so i might have to just set the height attribute sizes this is just setting the text sizes um yeah it doesn't seem like they have a prop they accept a prop for height so i guess that's just styling which makes sense so i text area um let me put a class here which will be text area um or i'll call it text area height all right so here i'll do a class text area height and then let me say height is i don't know 400 pixels let's see what that looks like oh wait that didn't save um oh wait i made a typo there okay so 400 pixels well that changed the vertical line but it didn't really change um this the text area so i wonder if i just pass in let me see let me edit the html here so if i just say height directly inside the element i think i can do 400 nope because it's draggable but i'd rather just have the height i might have to oh that's kind of cool you can just drag it doesn't expand past its container good so let me look up real quick text setting text area height should i size text area so it seems like you can just do width and height um yeah why can't i use width and height am i doing this wrong you have 400 pixels and let me just do a text area class because text area height as a class seems weird okay so i have i text area and now let me refresh okay well it's not changing the height um i can try one more thing otherwise i'll just move on um let me try setting height directly here because maybe it's just an undocumented api i don't know okay no that didn't work get rid of that all right so i'll just leave that alone for now then and figure out how to do that later anyway so i have the text from here and now i need to get the mark or turn it into formatted markdown on this side so let me um so i already installed the markdown library so actually i need to pull in the component so let me just look at the markdown library okay so i just import it import the component and then register it as a component so let me copy that um and then oops so in script i'll import markdown and then here i can register view markdown okay cool and then it's basically saying to pass in the markdown text into the component so into the default slot so i'll just copy this and put it right here okay first let me see if this displays on the page so let's see can't resolve uh bamboo one time that's interesting bevel doesn't seem to have anything to do with this markdown previewer let me see yeah it's just saying to install view markdown and nothing else okay let me look in the issues um what is it saying module not found error can't resolve babel runtime core get iterator okay so let me copy this real quick and here nope let me see um module not found let me see what it is in the terminal these dependencies were not found babble runtime all right let me try typing that in so these dependency or let me just type in babel babble run time cannot find module battle runtime all right this is electron but that's i mean that's the same error i'm getting delete node modules didn't seem to work for people um this is a popular answer npm install save deb let's see yeah i guess that makes sense install babel runtime and i wonder why they wouldn't list it as a dependency they had to install um let me let me install that i guess i'll install it as a regular dependency if this library is going to need it all the time so let me see if i install babel runtime all right installing all right now let me try running the dev server again um all right still okay let's see if that works okay sweet so this is good it's showing the markdown that i passed in here of course it's not real markdown let me write something in markdown and see let me just make this text bold so now the default should be bold and it's not bold okay it's bold now i had to refresh um all right cool so the markdown is working now i just have to get this text inside of this markdown field so let me just see if i can pass in the v model so my text variable and it doesn't seem to be updating so let me set a default text here and see if that works let me do hello there okay cool oh yeah oh yeah that's right i was like how did i tip it in there because it's v modeling to text okay so i think it just doesn't update as i'm typing it's not um the v model should be updating so let me look let me make sure that v model is updating my view dev tools in my app component yeah so the v model is updating my data my text variable is updating but it's not showing new output here so i wonder how i can get it to rerender where's my library let's see i'm guessing there's something here about rerendering the disk folder contains view okay um okay i think this is it watches which is an array html refresh automatically when the prop in this array changes okay i think this is what i want then let me just see source i wonder so i think instead of um using a default slot maybe i can pass in the string as source but in slots i could probably do things like emojis i'm not sure actually let me just see with watches let me pass an array to it so let me go let's see let me go to my mark down put this on two lines and watches equals oh one second um okay cool so that worked um i just wanted to fix the display but i think that zoomed in a little bit too okay so now let me come back to watches and um oh wait i need to pass an array here so this should be javascript oops and i think the syntax is all right so let's see if this works let me pass in text and let me refresh nope it doesn't work so the syntax must be let me just see so i'm passing in this prop watches to text so when the text variable changes the html should rerender but it's not so let's see what am i doing wrong enable html syntax okay so these are all defaulted to true anyway um dispatch when render finishes these are the events so i don't want to watch for the events um let me see well let me see if they have yeah they have an example folder so let me go into the example of index.html and okay yeah so instead of the slot they're passing in the string as source let me zoom in here the passing in the string is source um anchor oh here okay so they have like four different examples here oh they have a lot of different examples um okay let's see set interval mounted this dot source um but this i think oh so this set interval i think is telling it it's updating this dot source every time um so i wonder if i put it if i pass it in as source if it's going to watch for changes let me try that let me get rid of that and watches and then do source as text and then i'm gonna um find that if you find that okay so now let's see if that's watching for changes i don't know yeah sweet okay cool that was easy so now if i press enter enter and let me do header oh cool awesome that wasn't too bad header 2 and then i can do a checklist awesome it's completely functional um markdown sweet that wasn't too bad um let's see what could i change yeah in the mockups for some reason i thought maybe i'm gonna want to click format manually but actually i think this is good that it just automatically updates and previews that's much better than clicking a button okay cool so um let me just see if i can get this to set a height for some reason i'm not sure okay style height is changing as i drag it the style height so i wonder because when i search for height here on text area it just doesn't say anything about setting the height even in the examples oops did i do something okay my screen just went funny all right so even in the examples i don't know why i'm caught up on the height of it text field so i felt i feel like i should be able to just set it well here i mean it's setting it on style so i have a class of text area so um let's let me see if i can set height i have 400 pixels here um i wonder if that's being overwritten by um incline though by the incline framework this is so weird let me try putting a regular text area just outside of the container i'm going to say text text area and yeah just a plain text area oh let me give it a class let's say class of text area where is it yeah this one this regular plain text area i have is 400 pixels so it's something about um incline that's not accepting that class um let me try one more thing let me try to use a class that they're already oh i guess they aren't assigning a class to it oh because form input so there's a wrapper class around it they wrap it in form input group and then they wrap it in form input so let me try to change the height of one of the other ones oh let me try to change this one okay so if i change apparently so if i change form input the wrapper around text area that should be good so let me access or reference the form input class uh and i'll get rid of this extra class okay let me see if that works it still doesn't work form input so i think i need to um i'm going to try one more thing so is this set this as a module uh no i can't remember so there was something that you could do for dynamically updated classes actually i wonder if incline takes a set of classes that you can pass in let me search nope they don't have anything about classes here so i guess the only thing with incline is to um yeah basically update the sas variables which i don't have sas in my application although i did yeah when i i'm importing all of the sas variables here and registering the components and everything um okay so let me think i think there's so there's something in view for css and i think it's called module view css module in component uh it's been so long since i used this um maybe it wasn't called module let's see so i'm looking for the style tag yeah it is called module okay css modules then add the module attribute okay then it should be available on this let me zoom in it should be available now on the dollar sign style i wonder if that's going to change in v3 let me try that so this style tag is scoped so i'm going to add another style tag that i will put as a module oops so style um mod module and close it and now let me take this and here i'm going to put text area and height of 400 pixels okay let me just make sure they're defining it as a class yeah they are they're defining it as a class so let me um try that let me now go to text area and do class equals style dot text area and actually i'm thinking this might not work because i'm passing this into incline and i don't know which of the three dom elements it renders are going to get that class i have no idea all right so let me try yeah i think it's giving the class to a different element which is let's see app text area yeah it's giving the class to the parent element not to the child elements so this form input group is getting the class but i need it on form input um all right i guess the only other thing i can try is to see if someone else has had this issue on incline let's see text area height and nobody nobody nobody nobody's even said anything about text area all right so that's something that i will have to figure out after the stream or if someone has a recommendation then you can let me know about it oh well um yeah so i think this is pretty much it um if there are no comments in the chat then i think i'll just go ahead and push this code and yeah let me stop the view server let me do git status um markdown previewer oh right right so when i created a generated a view project in this directory um oh i thought it created a new git for me but i guess it didn't because the parent has a get directory as a git project already so let me go up and up to my free code camp projects and i'll do git status git add this new project that i have commit code from live stream on june 25th for markdown previewer okay that looks good now i'll push it okay and sweet so now i have the markdown previewer code from today all right so if there are no comments or chat messages it was a very quiet day next week i'll be building the drum machine at the same time if you want to tune in for that and yeah feel free to make a comment raise an issue on this repo and yeah give me feedback or whatever i'll be doing the view cli again for the drum machine next week and then for i guess the rest of the free code camp projects they get a little bit more complicated with each one so i'll start adding in other things like view router view x and maybe even by the end of this view three will will come out so then i can do something with v3 yeah so thanks for watching everyone if you were snooping and watching i can't see who's watching or anything but i hope you enjoyed this got something out of it uh don't forget to check out my channel faraday academy and have a great day everybody take care
