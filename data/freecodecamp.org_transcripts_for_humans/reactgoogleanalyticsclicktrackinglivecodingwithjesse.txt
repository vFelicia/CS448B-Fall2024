With timestamps:

00:06 - hey everybody it's Jesse and I've been
00:10 - gone for a while been on vacation so I
00:12 - hope everyone had a great week last week
00:14 - I thought about streaming while I was on
00:19 - vacation but there's no way Wi-Fi would
00:22 - have made it work would have been able
00:23 - to handle it
00:24 - it could barely handle like streaming
00:27 - Netflix at times so I did release one
00:33 - video on my own channel so if you
00:36 - haven't seen that yet you can check that
00:38 - out there's a link to my channel in the
00:41 - description for this video just really
00:43 - short kind of explaining how I got to be
00:46 - a front-end developer today I want to
00:54 - set up some click tracking so I was
00:59 - asked to track the clicks for every link
01:03 - that goes back to our main website from
01:09 - this website so it shouldn't be too
01:11 - difficult so we're already using we're
01:16 - already using a let me just let me show
01:22 - you what it is it's you know like an NPM
01:24 - module that we've imported and it's
01:27 - called react ga
01:29 - so here's reusing and we did do I did do
01:38 - a stream where we initially set this up
01:40 - or at least I remember doing a stream
01:43 - where I was trying to get this to work
01:44 - and I couldn't get it I don't think I
01:48 - get it to work out the way I wanted it
01:50 - to work but at some point I got this
01:53 - trying to get up to the top here so this
01:56 - is what we're going to be working with
01:57 - today and I included a link to this in
02:00 - the description as well so you can check
02:03 - it out if you want there's really only
02:05 - one part of you know it's pretty
02:09 - well-documented there's only one part of
02:11 - the
02:12 - that we're going to look at today that
02:16 - we're even going to need and it's the
02:19 - click tracking part let's see there we
02:26 - go this part I think we're going to try
02:28 - to use the component version of the
02:32 - click tracking there shouldn't be too
02:34 - many links that we have to edit so this
02:37 - should work
02:38 - hey everybody ok I see in the live chat
02:43 - everybody saying hi oh is hello from
02:49 - Brazil awesome
02:50 - welcome Oh Sean says back after so long
03:00 - and I'm left far behind what haven't
03:04 - done anything for a week so not quite as
03:07 - behind as as it could have been alright
03:10 - alright so we got our viewer count is is
03:13 - up to decent number here so I think
03:16 - we're going to get started first thing I
03:19 - do want to show you all is a course a
03:27 - course that I'm going to be taking and
03:33 - it looks it looked good and it's
03:37 - definitely definitely what I'm working
03:43 - on now so I'm just go throw this in here
03:45 - I don't know if you saw this I think I
03:47 - saw it on Twitter first and then
03:49 - actually then I noticed the email I got
03:51 - from Udacity after that but I noticed I
03:55 - saw on Twitter of quite a few retweets
03:59 - of this course on Udacity so if you've
04:04 - never done anything with Udacity before
04:06 - it has a lot of free online courses in a
04:10 - lot of different areas not just web
04:11 - development but this will be the first
04:16 - time I'm actually going to pay for the
04:19 - nanodegree
04:19 - so I've already already made my payment
04:23 - the course is $500
04:25 - and I'm not like officially recommending
04:29 - this or anything I haven't even taken it
04:32 - yet so I'm not sure if it's good but
04:33 - since I'm building in react and I know
04:35 - there's going to be a lot of sites that
04:37 - I will be doing in the future with react
04:40 - I thought it would be cool to take this
04:42 - so just wanted to share that it hasn't
04:46 - even started yet as you can see there's
04:48 - a countdown timer here so I will let you
04:50 - all know how the course is this one is
04:52 - unique a lot of the courses in Udacity
04:55 - are like totally self-paced this one is
04:57 - actually it has a definite start and end
05:00 - time and you have to get everything done
05:03 - within that amount of time so hopefully
05:06 - I can do that my schedule is like pretty
05:09 - busy but I'm hoping to be able to to
05:13 - stick to this you know this schedule
05:15 - this for months scheduled for this
05:16 - course and yeah don't let you know how
05:20 - it goes and if anybody else has signed
05:22 - up for this let me know or if you end up
05:25 - signing up later on let me know whoops
05:31 - there we go
05:32 - all right
05:46 - okay so I do have one question and the
05:49 - live chat about the analytics that thing
05:53 - that we're using the react GA the
05:57 - question from Philip is what are the
05:59 - advantage of you of coding with this
06:01 - overusing tag manager well in my case
06:06 - we're not set up with tag manager right
06:09 - now so all of our sites
06:11 - none of our sites are using tag manager
06:13 - that might change in the future but at
06:15 - least the easy answer is I might I'm
06:18 - it's just not set up like that I'm not
06:20 - the one that actually sets up a lot of
06:23 - these I set up some of these Google
06:24 - Analytics properties but not all of them
06:26 - so I didn't set up a lot of the sites
06:31 - when I started working here it was
06:32 - already set up so anyway we might move
06:35 - to tag manager in the future but for now
06:39 - we're going to use this I have from what
06:45 - I have read about tag manager it does
06:47 - seem like everything is easier with tag
06:50 - manager especially if you have a lot to
06:53 - manage and it would just be insane to do
06:55 - all this manually so I know that's not
06:59 - really a great answer sorry it's not a
07:03 - great answer but I don't really want to
07:08 - try to you know say any more about it
07:11 - when I'm not knowledgeable enough to
07:12 - give you a good answer
07:16 - looking for there we go footer I know we
07:20 - have some outbound links in the footer
07:22 - that we're going to be using so we'll
07:25 - just start there
07:26 - I'm trying anywhere else we have one in
07:29 - that in the header as well that maybe
07:33 - all the places that we need to to do
07:36 - this for so this is actually going to be
07:39 - a shorter video than normal I have a
07:41 - meeting at 3:00 so that there might be
07:44 - so some changes coming to this site that
07:46 - we've been working on for the last few
07:48 - week and all the meeting today and
07:52 - another meeting Thursday afternoon which
07:55 - I probably won't be able to stream
07:56 - Thursday afternoon because of it but
07:59 - based on what happens in the
08:00 - to meetings it's possible there could be
08:03 - significant changes coming to the site
08:05 - which I don't know to tell you the truth
08:08 - it doesn't excite me too much
08:11 - I mean this sites not perfect but I kind
08:14 - of like where we have it the direction
08:16 - we're going with it and I don't want to
08:21 - have to redo things that we've already
08:23 - done I wouldn't mind adding new features
08:25 - that'd be nice but I'd hate to you know
08:28 - go back over things since we put so much
08:29 - time into it so many long hours it would
08:33 - it would be a little bit terrible to
08:35 - have to go back in and I either
08:37 - completely take out or redo things that
08:40 - we spent so much time on so I'll let you
08:42 - know how that goes all right so I'm
08:47 - gonna move this these instructions over
08:52 - to my other screen so that I can look at
08:55 - these while we're while I'm coding so
08:57 - like I said before the link to the
08:59 - instructions remember following is in
09:01 - the show description so it looks like
09:06 - and we're going to test this and I
09:09 - picked this on purpose because I think
09:11 - this is going to be simple I think it's
09:13 - gonna be pretty easy and I don't have a
09:16 - lot of time to stream today so it looks
09:18 - like all we're gonna have to do is make
09:21 - sure that we include react GA here and
09:28 - then we're going to use the react GA dot
09:32 - outbound link component and all we have
09:35 - to do we bring it in for a second since
09:38 - I'm talking about it all we have to do
09:41 - then is then add an event label and a
09:46 - two
09:50 - so basically so instead of like an a tag
09:53 - we'll replace it with this tag and then
09:57 - we put in the link text as normal so
10:01 - hopefully that works and we'll test it
10:03 - out I have my Google Analytics open
10:06 - already on my other window I'll bring
10:08 - that in when it's time to test it but
10:11 - that's the plan so I'm just going to
10:14 - grab I want to check out in our
10:19 - analytics J's file import all right Y
10:26 - type it when I can just copy and paste
10:28 - so I'm going to take that and then I'm
10:32 - going to go back up here to footer and
10:36 - [Music]
10:37 - I'm going to report that as well and now
10:40 - let's find over yet
10:45 - here we go so this is what we want - any
10:49 - links to the main website or what we
10:51 - want to actually let me let me check one
10:55 - of my Trello board this is where we have
10:58 - everything that needs to be done and has
11:01 - already been done all the tasks for the
11:02 - site yep it is just Franciscan dot edu
11:11 - okay I just wanted to double-check
11:13 - before we started doing this that I had
11:16 - the right length so let's change this to
11:23 - react ta dot outbound
11:31 - and same thing here okay now we need I'm
11:43 - going to copy some of this here
11:55 - I guess we just need to label alright so
11:58 - I'm assuming it doesn't show this in the
12:02 - instructions but I'm assuming we can
12:04 - still have a title tag and it would just
12:06 - go right here so I'm going to leave the
12:07 - title tag in there that's pretty
12:10 - standard on a link tag so hopefully that
12:13 - still works so I guess for the label
12:19 - we'll just say to francisc and I wonder
12:29 - if I can and you know about this to main
12:37 - site all right that's basically what we
12:40 - call it around here Franciscan dot e to
12:42 - use is always either called the dot edu
12:44 - or the main site so that'll work for us
12:48 - and you can change this href to a two
12:55 - all right
12:56 - like I said I said I don't know if this
13:04 - title having a title here or mess it up
13:06 - it doesn't say anything about it and
13:08 - documentation so I'm going to leave it
13:10 - in there for now see if it works so
13:12 - everything else should work I'm going to
13:14 - say this I do want to check out to make
13:17 - sure that it doesn't mess with the
13:22 - display
13:28 - all right so it looks like I'm gonna
13:31 - bring this over so y'all can see it so
13:34 - this is the link that I changed down
13:37 - here and it looks like the title is
13:41 - still working awesome I'm going to click
13:46 - it what pop uh plugs yes I always allow
13:56 - pop-ups from low blows all right so it
14:06 - looks like it's trying to go there so
14:07 - the main site just happens to be really
14:10 - slow great so that went to the right
14:12 - place now let's bring over our analytics
14:19 - our analytics dashboard here so if you
14:23 - haven't seen the new Google Analytics
14:25 - dashboard this is it so this is actually
14:29 - the first time I saw it I haven't
14:30 - checked analytics since this happened
14:33 - this is pretty recent within the last I
14:35 - don't know a week or so right so we
14:43 - should be able to go it looks like all
14:44 - this stuff over here is still the same
14:46 - so hopefully it is let's see events
14:51 - let's see if we had an event happen
14:58 - hmm sick we didn't have anything happen
15:03 - it's it's possible that I'm not going to
15:08 - see it until I make this live
15:18 - so let's so actually working on some
15:23 - stuff earlier that I forgot to commit so
15:34 - let me bring this over I'm just going to
15:37 - do a
15:45 - I'm going to commit this I'm going to
15:47 - push it to github and we're actually
15:49 - we're going to pull this live the stuff
15:51 - I was working on some stuff earlier but
15:53 - I've tested it out I think everything's
15:55 - working well most of it was just really
15:58 - minor things so let's do
16:20 - all right so I was working on the events
16:22 - page and I'm not going to say anything
16:25 - about the link tracking yet I'm not sure
16:28 - if it even works
16:35 - but it's a good sign that we didn't get
16:37 - an error message at least okay now
16:41 - here's our servers alright let's see if
16:50 - you get the IP here we go
17:00 - I turned my computer off and turn it
17:04 - back on and for some reason my normally
17:07 - I have a history of all the commands and
17:10 - it's separated per tab but it's not it's
17:14 - not working out like it normally does
17:18 - all right so let's update so if you
17:31 - remember from previous episodes we have
17:34 - load balancing happening so just to
17:37 - explain in case anyone missed it all
17:39 - we're doing right now with this long
17:41 - string of commands which I just copy and
17:44 - paste it in we're stopping nginx we're
17:47 - stopping the react app we're going into
17:51 - the directory where our project lives
17:55 - and we're pulling in the changes from
17:57 - github we're installing anything that
18:01 - there's new any new packages that need
18:03 - to be installed we're building it and
18:06 - then starting it again
18:07 - and then starting engine X that ensures
18:11 - that our load balancer routes everything
18:15 - to the other server while this is down
18:16 - and then when this is back up then we
18:21 - can go to the other server and do the
18:23 - same thing
18:30 - and while this is how whoops while this
18:35 - is happening I can catch up on the live
18:38 - chat since I've been ignoring you all so
18:40 - far sorry I just feel the pressure today
18:44 - to be done since I have that meeting so
18:48 - let's uh let me go back okay there's not
18:53 - a lot I thought I missed it a lot in the
18:55 - live chat but it looks like there's not
18:56 - a whole lot that I missed so I'm going
18:59 - to go through really quick a with
19:01 - someone from Dominican Republic awesome
19:03 - hello from India Andrew asks why
19:08 - master's degrees are so expensive online
19:10 - I mean that I think they're expensive
19:14 - everywhere online or on ground it's
19:16 - degrees or dis for me being expensive
19:18 - nowadays yeah I mean I was unless you
19:24 - really need a master's degree for a job
19:26 - that you want then I wouldn't do it I
19:30 - know people to just get done with their
19:33 - undergraduate degree and they aren't
19:34 - sure what to do so they just decide to
19:36 - stay and get their master's degree I
19:38 - mean if if your family's rich maybe
19:41 - that's okay but but for me that's that's
19:49 - not what I did
19:50 - this too much I mean few scholarships
19:53 - maybe that would work out but it's just
19:56 - too expensive especially if you're not
19:58 - if you don't have you know a pretty good
20:01 - chance of getting a good-paying job from
20:03 - it alright if someone says hello from
20:09 - Iran hello awesome
20:14 - alright Philip earlier Philip that asks
20:17 - a question about google tag manager and
20:19 - he did mention he said it is much easier
20:22 - so something I yeah I know I didn't
20:25 - fully answer that question but
20:28 - definitely if you are setting up a site
20:30 - in a Google Analytics property for the
20:32 - first time and you could do it however
20:33 - you want I recommend checking out tag
20:35 - manager everything I've seen about it
20:39 - looks great and
20:41 - I at some point I would it would be nice
20:44 - to switch everything that we're doing
20:46 - here over to tag manager oh no I just
20:57 - checked out I'm sure you all saw this
20:59 - but I just checked out the the output
21:05 - here in the terminal and it looks like
21:10 - local changes would be overwritten by
21:13 - the marriage please commit your changes
21:14 - which stash them before you can merge oh
21:21 - goodness
21:33 - okay
21:43 - all right this is I know what happened
21:47 - okay so someone else that works with me
21:49 - here when I was on vacation tried to
21:53 - make changes directly to the server so
21:58 - these are those changes I've forgotten
22:00 - about that so I actually don't I don't
22:04 - want to keep these changes
22:20 - - let me actually I wish I don't think
22:31 - he changed anything that I need to keep
22:33 - I think I'm good and I can just get rid
22:36 - of these changes so let's see I wonder
22:40 - how he did it he must have just used
22:43 - like Nano or something to edit these
22:45 - uh-huh okay yeah I I was just thinking
22:58 - that Patrick Patrick just put in the lab
23:00 - chat get diff that's yeah I was I was
23:03 - thinking the only thing that I probably
23:09 - I do want to keep is this image all
23:18 - right
23:20 - let's uh
23:31 - actually let me check let me check
23:35 - quickly on I want to see what the
23:41 - difference is went between this image so
23:46 - I just want to know what changed with it
23:53 - all right so here's the one page this is
23:56 - the live page and here's the image I
23:59 - think this is the image that we're
24:00 - talking about here and then this is the
24:10 - one
24:16 - they these look nearly identical right
24:21 - what is the difference here
24:39 - okay there's one difference in the names
24:45 - so we definitely do want to keep this
24:48 - alright so actually we do need to keep
24:50 - these changes and all right so all right
24:59 - well this makes things slightly more
25:01 - difficult and I wonder if the other
25:05 - server is the same
25:22 - all right so it's actually not really
25:26 - that bad that this happened because as I
25:29 - always say when I make mistakes then you
25:33 - don't have to make them you can just see
25:35 - what I did and how I messed it up and
25:36 - can avoid it hopefully so I yeah so
25:41 - don't edit files on the server directly
25:45 - that's a moral of the story and if it
25:51 - does happen don't forget about it so
25:54 - let's just yep it's on here too
26:30 - okay all right so here's what I'm
26:35 - thinking
26:35 - here's what I'm going to try to do I'm
26:39 - going to commit these changes
26:49 - on one of the servers on just one of the
26:52 - servers and I'm going to push them shoot
27:00 - it's like pushing I guess I'll just I'll
27:10 - commit it I'll merge everything and then
27:12 - I'll push it back up to the main git
27:13 - repo and then I'll pull it down to the
27:16 - other server and then I'll have to pull
27:20 - everything back down locally does that
27:22 - make sense I think that yeah that'll I
27:28 - think that'll work
27:29 - okay so actually
27:40 - okay it looks like the changes are just
27:44 - really really minor all right
27:47 - [Music]
28:09 - tell me who you are what
28:20 - I have to say Who I am alright then
28:26 - let's say UI
28:40 - I can't believe a change so simple ended
28:45 - up not being simple I finally thought I
28:48 - was going to have an easy one but okay
29:05 - so at least I can go back to the live
29:07 - chat while this is working alright great
29:09 - so I'm going to do get pull and I'll
29:26 - remember that one okay now unfortunately
29:36 - I won't really be able to see it on
29:49 - okay I guess if I want to try to test I
29:53 - was just thinking about testing these
29:54 - out I can just pull this down and then
30:01 - we can make sure that it's working so
30:04 - I'm gonna bring this over this is our
30:05 - local version just my server not working
30:10 - let's see
30:29 - okay
30:37 - this is our new one no it's not right
30:42 - this is still yeah it's yeah it's only
30:45 - one so okay so that's our new one
30:48 - so did fully changes down what's the
30:55 - other thing we have one of the lines up
30:58 - here I'm not going to try to find a line
31:00 - but
31:09 - all right so it looks like that's cool
31:12 - that works now we can go ahead with
31:17 - starting to get pull and I need to we
31:27 - got stopped right in the middle of that
31:29 - long line of command so we got stopped
31:31 - right at the get pull part so I'm just
31:37 - going to copy the rest of the command
31:39 - and paste it in there so we're going to
31:41 - do the art NPM install we're going to
31:44 - run a build process and then we're going
31:47 - to start ok so a little little
31:54 - inconvenience there but pretty much
31:57 - passed it all right
32:04 - so Sebastian says five hundred yeah
32:07 - maybe I'll stick to youtube tutorials
32:09 - he's refering to the Udacity course yeah
32:12 - I had the I signed up for it last week
32:18 - when I was on vacation and I actually
32:20 - had the page open to sign up for the
32:23 - course on my laptop for like two days
32:26 - before I made the decision finally to do
32:28 - it but I thought I don't know I thought
32:33 - it would motivate me since lately I've
32:35 - been really slacking on doing tutorials
32:37 - on my own I thought it would motivate me
32:40 - if I actually spent the money to do the
32:43 - course so the plan my plan is to wake up
32:46 - early before my kids wake up which can
32:49 - be challenging but to wake up early and
32:52 - do oh man more more problems so my plan
33:02 - is to wake up early and maybe like do a
33:04 - workout I have like a exercise bike in
33:06 - my basement so maybe I can do my work
33:10 - for this course while I'm doing you know
33:13 - a little workout in the morning and then
33:15 - maybe again like on my lunch break
33:17 - I'll do the course so I could probably
33:19 - get in like around 2 hours everyday if
33:22 - we
33:23 - with a course and then a little bit on
33:25 - Saturday I think it said like estimate
33:27 - is made 12 hours a week so if I do that
33:30 - then it should be good Monday or Monday
33:33 - through Saturday I put in 2 hours a day
33:35 - and it should be my twelve hours and it
33:36 - should work so hopefully it works out
33:39 - like that all right let's check out
33:43 - what's happening here
34:03 - who
34:20 - well this is not not good here
34:32 - so our build is not working
35:14 - all right Patrick says another reason
35:19 - not to make changes directly in
35:21 - production this is justification for a
35:24 - load balancer stuff you went through I
35:26 - was just thinking the same thing Patrick
35:28 - so yes if you I think I mentioned
35:32 - earlier but this site is using a load
35:33 - balancer so if one servers down
35:35 - everything gets directed to another
35:37 - server so right now the site I'm
35:39 - assuming is still up because the other
35:41 - server is fine so since we just since I
35:44 - don't know what just happened with this
35:46 - server then at least the site still up
35:50 - and somebody else asked something like
35:52 - like with what are you doing and I
35:55 - edited that but basically what we were
36:00 - trying to do is something really simple
36:02 - and it should have worked
36:04 - but basically some changes were made on
36:09 - directly on the server that it seems
36:11 - have messed some things up so we're
36:13 - trying to sort that out
36:16 - so let me
36:30 - this is just really weird
36:47 - um she
36:53 - this Patek is Jason
37:05 - yeah it's not like nothing's changed in
37:08 - my package.json I haven't really added I
37:12 - was trying to think if I added any
37:15 - packages since the last time I pushed
37:18 - anything to the server and I think no I
37:20 - really I don't think I've added anything
37:23 - on the master branch all the stuff that
37:26 - we've been doing has been on separate
37:30 - branches and it's not actually even been
37:33 - merged in one master so yeah so this
37:41 - should be let's see
38:04 - I realize we'll probably get the exact
38:06 - same issue but it's worth the try
38:10 - occasionally run something a second time
38:12 - and for some reason it works I also want
38:19 - to run this locally just to see if
38:24 - something's I do have you aren't
38:33 - installed locally so but I want to try
38:35 - to do it this in the same way way did it
38:42 - work that time you gotta be kidding me
38:48 - there's no way all right let's all right
38:53 - so the next command would be
39:04 - it works alright alright this is if
39:13 - anybody knows what just happened here
39:15 - fill me in but it's obviously the first
39:18 - time this was run we got all these
39:21 - errors the second time I got nothing oh
39:26 - well so I'm going to continue with the
39:29 - rest of the commands to restart this
39:31 - server
39:32 - and then we'll check it out so at this
39:42 - point we should just restart we're using
39:45 - PM 2 to start things up ok and what I
39:55 - want to do is I want to try to go
40:04 - directly to this IP I think if I go
40:08 - directly to that IP address I can get
40:10 - right to that server and won't get
40:13 - switched over to the other server so we
40:17 - want it to look like so basically we'll
40:23 - be able to tell if we've gone right to
40:24 - that server if it's worked if we if this
40:26 - area has changed significantly
40:38 - and say yep there we go okay so
40:43 - everything has changed correctly I'm
40:48 - just going to inspect really quick to
40:50 - see if we're getting any weird errors
40:56 - okay so we're getting this weird error a
40:58 - page does not exist speaking the truth
41:01 - and love conference so I'm trying to
41:04 - prefetch this page and maybe prefetching
41:08 - doesn't work with the dynamically yet so
41:16 - let me I do want to test this link hmm
41:22 - all right so that link doesn't work it's
41:25 - this actually did work locally so I did
41:28 - test it earlier this is from something I
41:31 - tried to do earlier today all right so
41:34 - aside from that which can be changed
41:40 - really quickly aside from that this is
41:47 - pretty much working so it's working
41:49 - enough that we can at least try to to
41:52 - test what we were going to we were
41:54 - initially trying to test so let me find
41:58 - my analytics and let's see actually
42:06 - let's make sure that we're one for today
42:13 - yeah
42:18 - looks like
42:26 - see two main site okay
42:29 - so it looks like we didn't have to do it
42:31 - in fact I completely forgot that by
42:35 - default Google Analytics doesn't show
42:37 - you the stuff from the current day so it
42:40 - was actually just showing me from like
42:42 - the last week or so I forget what the
42:45 - range was so when I set it to show
42:47 - today's stuff it actually did work from
42:50 - localist so that part worked so since
42:56 - we've kind of gotten into this big mess
42:58 - now anyway with the servers I am going
43:02 - to fix that quickly but basically this
43:05 - works so let's go back and let's add
43:10 - this
43:10 - I'm not going to update the other server
43:13 - just yet which is going to it shouldn't
43:18 - cause a problem for the two minutes that
43:21 - it's going to take to fix this so let's
43:26 - go over let's go over here back to our
43:32 - page and we need to do two things one on
43:41 - events we need to not prefetch let's see
43:51 - photos up here someone let me it's dumb
43:54 - yeah it's down here okay so and
43:58 - eventually all this stuff will be out of
44:00 - our code anyway and it will be pulled in
44:02 - through the WordPress API but for now
44:06 - for now let's get rid of this this
44:09 - prefetch
44:18 - and I'm wondering now should I get rid
44:20 - of whatever I should get rid of all of
44:26 - it let's just let's see I'm going to say
44:32 - that hopefully that'll fix the issue now
44:38 - you know it might not because we're
44:40 - still getting the 404 so
44:48 - let me bring it back that error here so
44:53 - the error is trying to go to saying this
45:00 - doesn't exist let's see if we'll get the
45:04 - same error see if we can go on our our
45:16 - test version of this which I'll pull it
45:18 - over so the test version let's inspect
45:23 - this okay so I'm not getting that error
45:31 - and our test version but I'm still I'm
45:36 - getting the 404 but then it then it
45:39 - works okay so now I am getting that
45:43 - error see I'm getting this error here so
45:45 - here's what we're going to do let's go
45:55 - that's that's really odd
46:01 - it's an odd air so basically I'm just
46:06 - going to remove this link and I'm not
46:09 - going to use the link I'm just going to
46:10 - use a regular a tag and we'll try that
46:19 - out and see if that works so
46:32 - see
46:37 - - oh right
47:02 - all right let me check we're getting to
47:04 - the end I'm going to have to finish up
47:06 - soon for my three o'clock meeting so I'm
47:08 - going to check the live chat quickly
47:10 - just see if there's any questions you
47:13 - all have let's see all Patrick mentioned
47:21 - you could put that in a bastion alias oh
47:23 - that long string of commands that I
47:25 - copied and pasted in when we were trying
47:27 - to shut off the server and then update
47:30 - it and restart it he says you can put
47:32 - that in a bash alias and you can I do
47:34 - recommend doing that I just haven't done
47:36 - it yet but I do want to do that for now
47:42 - and especially because it's just me
47:43 - working on it for the most part it's
47:47 - just easy for me to just copy it over
47:50 - but it would be a better idea to to make
47:57 - a batch alias for it okay
48:01 - so we've taken this we've just made it a
48:04 - regular a tag let's click it and see
48:07 - what happens so I'm gonna see that looks
48:11 - good alright that looks good only bad
48:16 - thing is we're not getting our
48:17 - client-side routing you see we got a
48:19 - full page refresh I don't like that but
48:22 - I think it's ok it's ok for now I'm not
48:28 - sure if we can have the client-side
48:30 - routing when we've because for this
48:33 - we've used custom so we've edited our
48:37 - server ojs file and we've used some
48:40 - custom routing to use parameterised
48:42 - routing so that's like outside the scope
48:44 - of what next does so I'm thinking maybe
48:48 - the next client-side routing system
48:51 - can't work with that I don't know but
48:54 - for now this is good this gives us what
48:57 - we what we want for the most part so I'm
49:01 - going to stick with that and let's go
49:06 - back to alright so we had we were
49:09 - working in footage is so this worked I
49:13 - do want to make sure
49:16 - I want to see where else we have this
49:22 - goodness
49:23 - I wonder it's just going to you very
49:30 - much sooner
49:30 - yeah I don't think we need to track all
49:34 - these links like obviously to the
49:37 - privacy policy and things like that we
49:40 - don't need to track that so I think
49:42 - we're good we're good tracking that you
49:44 - said we have one in the sit in the head
49:48 - I mean maybe the nav yeah oops
50:00 - and there's my Google my calendar for my
50:08 - meeting
50:09 - oh yeah um okay so we need to track this
50:20 - yeah I need to check this let me make
50:23 - sure I'm a cantina okay I have ten
50:25 - minutes so let's do the same thing with
50:28 - this one hopefully it our class name
50:37 - stuff still works as well let's pull in
50:43 - this and we at nav
51:00 - and
51:00 - [Music]
51:05 - this react actually with time today you
51:10 - know I'm not going to do this right now
51:12 - because two things one I want to answer
51:18 - your questions and live chat also I want
51:21 - to make sure I sort out this server
51:22 - thing before I have my meeting so we'll
51:26 - stop here because I can always basically
51:29 - we've got it working so for the purpose
51:31 - of you know figuring out how to do this
51:34 - we've done it we've accomplished it we
51:35 - just need to apply the same thing to a
51:37 - few other places so that's worked what
51:40 - we need to do now is push our change up
51:46 - to github so the change we made to the
51:56 - to the length so we got rid of the
51:59 - prefetching to get rid of the
52:00 - client-side routing we just used to read
52:02 - your link and then that that fix the
52:04 - errors we were getting
52:21 - okay
52:30 - shoot okay so you see the areas we're
52:33 - getting where we define some things and
52:37 - never used it basically we added this
52:40 - and nav and we're not going to use it
52:41 - yet so we'll just add that back in at
52:43 - some point and then in footer not footer
52:47 - events we added in the link but then now
52:53 - we're not going to use that anymore so
52:59 - very useful to to check this stuff out
53:05 - beforehand and
53:07 - [Music]
53:25 - whoa okay I just saw this in the lab
53:29 - chat so Sebastian says check issue
53:31 - number 71 for react GA it says browsers
53:35 - block react GA length hmm
53:42 - that might be an issue I'm still going
53:45 - to push this change to fix the other
53:46 - thing but I'm going to come back to that
53:48 - after my meeting though and check out
53:50 - that issue because that could definitely
53:52 - a problem all right okay so if you're
54:01 - not familiar with github
54:02 - we've just committed our changes and
54:05 - then we're pushing them up to github on
54:09 - the master branch now I can go in here
54:13 - to our server and let me run our our set
54:21 - of commands that we've been copying so
54:27 - actually go back out the commands assume
54:32 - that I'm not already in the directory
54:36 - for the project
54:38 - so hopefully this all works now we don't
54:45 - get any errors we can test it quickly
54:49 - and hopefully it works all right let me
54:52 - go through world boss asks you have a
54:56 - bachelors yes I do have a bachelor's
54:59 - degree I have a bachelor's degree in
55:02 - business
55:13 - sharmi says usually master's degree for
55:16 - people who love to do research or an
55:18 - academics or the company requires that
55:20 - for our position yeah you're right a lot
55:22 - of times higher degrees are for research
55:24 - stuff I know at least the United States
55:27 - a lot of people get master's degrees in
55:28 - business and then they can get higher up
55:31 - in their organization even though they
55:33 - don't do any research that's so that's
55:37 - you know the only other reason that I've
55:38 - seen for them else like if you want to
55:41 - teach like normally they don't let you
55:43 - teach anything at a university unless
55:45 - you add the very least have a master's
55:47 - degree prefer a doctorate so that's
55:50 - another reason why some people get them
55:52 - all right so let's check it out
55:56 - and what do we have it maybe I pulled it
56:00 - over to a different place I think this
56:08 - was the one where we actually went see
56:13 - that pulled us over to the other server
56:15 - let me try to let me great try to grab
56:19 - the IP address again see if we can get
56:21 - straight there
56:33 - so see without with our load balancers
56:35 - right now is taking us to the older
56:36 - version of the site that's on our other
56:38 - server let's see hmm still taking us CEO
56:48 - sir
57:03 - mmm
57:10 - all right well let's
57:22 - let's see shoot I run this again okay
58:00 - okay so now we should be good to run run
58:12 - these commands okay all right back to
58:25 - the latch at get in this I have two
58:27 - minutes so sorry if I can't get to all
58:29 - your questions
58:30 - [Music]
58:44 - okay so it looks like looks like I'm
58:53 - going to I am going to need to check out
58:55 - the issue where with blouse browsers
58:57 - blocking blocking the links from react
59:02 - GA so um Patrick says it might be a
59:06 - target --blank issue so I'm going to
59:09 - test that out after my meeting sorry
59:15 - didn't really have a Q&A this time get
59:18 - to it definitely next time hopefully I
59:22 - won't have another meeting tomorrow but
59:23 - anyway thank you all for for watching
59:26 - thanks for your help my meetings in one
59:30 - minute so I have to go but I should be
59:32 - back should be back tomorrow and if
59:36 - anybody has any helpful links I know you
59:41 - guys were talking about some issues and
59:42 - stuff please post it in the live chat or
59:45 - message me on Twitter or something
59:47 - because I do want to figure out this
59:48 - problem as soon as my meeting is over
59:55 - all right but anyway I'll see you
59:58 - tomorrow have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody it's Jesse and I've been gone for a while been on vacation so I hope everyone had a great week last week I thought about streaming while I was on vacation but there's no way WiFi would have made it work would have been able to handle it it could barely handle like streaming Netflix at times so I did release one video on my own channel so if you haven't seen that yet you can check that out there's a link to my channel in the description for this video just really short kind of explaining how I got to be a frontend developer today I want to set up some click tracking so I was asked to track the clicks for every link that goes back to our main website from this website so it shouldn't be too difficult so we're already using we're already using a let me just let me show you what it is it's you know like an NPM module that we've imported and it's called react ga so here's reusing and we did do I did do a stream where we initially set this up or at least I remember doing a stream where I was trying to get this to work and I couldn't get it I don't think I get it to work out the way I wanted it to work but at some point I got this trying to get up to the top here so this is what we're going to be working with today and I included a link to this in the description as well so you can check it out if you want there's really only one part of you know it's pretty welldocumented there's only one part of the that we're going to look at today that we're even going to need and it's the click tracking part let's see there we go this part I think we're going to try to use the component version of the click tracking there shouldn't be too many links that we have to edit so this should work hey everybody ok I see in the live chat everybody saying hi oh is hello from Brazil awesome welcome Oh Sean says back after so long and I'm left far behind what haven't done anything for a week so not quite as behind as as it could have been alright alright so we got our viewer count is is up to decent number here so I think we're going to get started first thing I do want to show you all is a course a course that I'm going to be taking and it looks it looked good and it's definitely definitely what I'm working on now so I'm just go throw this in here I don't know if you saw this I think I saw it on Twitter first and then actually then I noticed the email I got from Udacity after that but I noticed I saw on Twitter of quite a few retweets of this course on Udacity so if you've never done anything with Udacity before it has a lot of free online courses in a lot of different areas not just web development but this will be the first time I'm actually going to pay for the nanodegree so I've already already made my payment the course is $500 and I'm not like officially recommending this or anything I haven't even taken it yet so I'm not sure if it's good but since I'm building in react and I know there's going to be a lot of sites that I will be doing in the future with react I thought it would be cool to take this so just wanted to share that it hasn't even started yet as you can see there's a countdown timer here so I will let you all know how the course is this one is unique a lot of the courses in Udacity are like totally selfpaced this one is actually it has a definite start and end time and you have to get everything done within that amount of time so hopefully I can do that my schedule is like pretty busy but I'm hoping to be able to to stick to this you know this schedule this for months scheduled for this course and yeah don't let you know how it goes and if anybody else has signed up for this let me know or if you end up signing up later on let me know whoops there we go all right okay so I do have one question and the live chat about the analytics that thing that we're using the react GA the question from Philip is what are the advantage of you of coding with this overusing tag manager well in my case we're not set up with tag manager right now so all of our sites none of our sites are using tag manager that might change in the future but at least the easy answer is I might I'm it's just not set up like that I'm not the one that actually sets up a lot of these I set up some of these Google Analytics properties but not all of them so I didn't set up a lot of the sites when I started working here it was already set up so anyway we might move to tag manager in the future but for now we're going to use this I have from what I have read about tag manager it does seem like everything is easier with tag manager especially if you have a lot to manage and it would just be insane to do all this manually so I know that's not really a great answer sorry it's not a great answer but I don't really want to try to you know say any more about it when I'm not knowledgeable enough to give you a good answer looking for there we go footer I know we have some outbound links in the footer that we're going to be using so we'll just start there I'm trying anywhere else we have one in that in the header as well that maybe all the places that we need to to do this for so this is actually going to be a shorter video than normal I have a meeting at 300 so that there might be so some changes coming to this site that we've been working on for the last few week and all the meeting today and another meeting Thursday afternoon which I probably won't be able to stream Thursday afternoon because of it but based on what happens in the to meetings it's possible there could be significant changes coming to the site which I don't know to tell you the truth it doesn't excite me too much I mean this sites not perfect but I kind of like where we have it the direction we're going with it and I don't want to have to redo things that we've already done I wouldn't mind adding new features that'd be nice but I'd hate to you know go back over things since we put so much time into it so many long hours it would it would be a little bit terrible to have to go back in and I either completely take out or redo things that we spent so much time on so I'll let you know how that goes all right so I'm gonna move this these instructions over to my other screen so that I can look at these while we're while I'm coding so like I said before the link to the instructions remember following is in the show description so it looks like and we're going to test this and I picked this on purpose because I think this is going to be simple I think it's gonna be pretty easy and I don't have a lot of time to stream today so it looks like all we're gonna have to do is make sure that we include react GA here and then we're going to use the react GA dot outbound link component and all we have to do we bring it in for a second since I'm talking about it all we have to do then is then add an event label and a two so basically so instead of like an a tag we'll replace it with this tag and then we put in the link text as normal so hopefully that works and we'll test it out I have my Google Analytics open already on my other window I'll bring that in when it's time to test it but that's the plan so I'm just going to grab I want to check out in our analytics J's file import all right Y type it when I can just copy and paste so I'm going to take that and then I'm going to go back up here to footer and I'm going to report that as well and now let's find over yet here we go so this is what we want any links to the main website or what we want to actually let me let me check one of my Trello board this is where we have everything that needs to be done and has already been done all the tasks for the site yep it is just Franciscan dot edu okay I just wanted to doublecheck before we started doing this that I had the right length so let's change this to react ta dot outbound and same thing here okay now we need I'm going to copy some of this here I guess we just need to label alright so I'm assuming it doesn't show this in the instructions but I'm assuming we can still have a title tag and it would just go right here so I'm going to leave the title tag in there that's pretty standard on a link tag so hopefully that still works so I guess for the label we'll just say to francisc and I wonder if I can and you know about this to main site all right that's basically what we call it around here Franciscan dot e to use is always either called the dot edu or the main site so that'll work for us and you can change this href to a two all right like I said I said I don't know if this title having a title here or mess it up it doesn't say anything about it and documentation so I'm going to leave it in there for now see if it works so everything else should work I'm going to say this I do want to check out to make sure that it doesn't mess with the display all right so it looks like I'm gonna bring this over so y'all can see it so this is the link that I changed down here and it looks like the title is still working awesome I'm going to click it what pop uh plugs yes I always allow popups from low blows all right so it looks like it's trying to go there so the main site just happens to be really slow great so that went to the right place now let's bring over our analytics our analytics dashboard here so if you haven't seen the new Google Analytics dashboard this is it so this is actually the first time I saw it I haven't checked analytics since this happened this is pretty recent within the last I don't know a week or so right so we should be able to go it looks like all this stuff over here is still the same so hopefully it is let's see events let's see if we had an event happen hmm sick we didn't have anything happen it's it's possible that I'm not going to see it until I make this live so let's so actually working on some stuff earlier that I forgot to commit so let me bring this over I'm just going to do a I'm going to commit this I'm going to push it to github and we're actually we're going to pull this live the stuff I was working on some stuff earlier but I've tested it out I think everything's working well most of it was just really minor things so let's do all right so I was working on the events page and I'm not going to say anything about the link tracking yet I'm not sure if it even works but it's a good sign that we didn't get an error message at least okay now here's our servers alright let's see if you get the IP here we go I turned my computer off and turn it back on and for some reason my normally I have a history of all the commands and it's separated per tab but it's not it's not working out like it normally does all right so let's update so if you remember from previous episodes we have load balancing happening so just to explain in case anyone missed it all we're doing right now with this long string of commands which I just copy and paste it in we're stopping nginx we're stopping the react app we're going into the directory where our project lives and we're pulling in the changes from github we're installing anything that there's new any new packages that need to be installed we're building it and then starting it again and then starting engine X that ensures that our load balancer routes everything to the other server while this is down and then when this is back up then we can go to the other server and do the same thing and while this is how whoops while this is happening I can catch up on the live chat since I've been ignoring you all so far sorry I just feel the pressure today to be done since I have that meeting so let's uh let me go back okay there's not a lot I thought I missed it a lot in the live chat but it looks like there's not a whole lot that I missed so I'm going to go through really quick a with someone from Dominican Republic awesome hello from India Andrew asks why master's degrees are so expensive online I mean that I think they're expensive everywhere online or on ground it's degrees or dis for me being expensive nowadays yeah I mean I was unless you really need a master's degree for a job that you want then I wouldn't do it I know people to just get done with their undergraduate degree and they aren't sure what to do so they just decide to stay and get their master's degree I mean if if your family's rich maybe that's okay but but for me that's that's not what I did this too much I mean few scholarships maybe that would work out but it's just too expensive especially if you're not if you don't have you know a pretty good chance of getting a goodpaying job from it alright if someone says hello from Iran hello awesome alright Philip earlier Philip that asks a question about google tag manager and he did mention he said it is much easier so something I yeah I know I didn't fully answer that question but definitely if you are setting up a site in a Google Analytics property for the first time and you could do it however you want I recommend checking out tag manager everything I've seen about it looks great and I at some point I would it would be nice to switch everything that we're doing here over to tag manager oh no I just checked out I'm sure you all saw this but I just checked out the the output here in the terminal and it looks like local changes would be overwritten by the marriage please commit your changes which stash them before you can merge oh goodness okay all right this is I know what happened okay so someone else that works with me here when I was on vacation tried to make changes directly to the server so these are those changes I've forgotten about that so I actually don't I don't want to keep these changes let me actually I wish I don't think he changed anything that I need to keep I think I'm good and I can just get rid of these changes so let's see I wonder how he did it he must have just used like Nano or something to edit these uhhuh okay yeah I I was just thinking that Patrick Patrick just put in the lab chat get diff that's yeah I was I was thinking the only thing that I probably I do want to keep is this image all right let's uh actually let me check let me check quickly on I want to see what the difference is went between this image so I just want to know what changed with it all right so here's the one page this is the live page and here's the image I think this is the image that we're talking about here and then this is the one they these look nearly identical right what is the difference here okay there's one difference in the names so we definitely do want to keep this alright so actually we do need to keep these changes and all right so all right well this makes things slightly more difficult and I wonder if the other server is the same all right so it's actually not really that bad that this happened because as I always say when I make mistakes then you don't have to make them you can just see what I did and how I messed it up and can avoid it hopefully so I yeah so don't edit files on the server directly that's a moral of the story and if it does happen don't forget about it so let's just yep it's on here too okay all right so here's what I'm thinking here's what I'm going to try to do I'm going to commit these changes on one of the servers on just one of the servers and I'm going to push them shoot it's like pushing I guess I'll just I'll commit it I'll merge everything and then I'll push it back up to the main git repo and then I'll pull it down to the other server and then I'll have to pull everything back down locally does that make sense I think that yeah that'll I think that'll work okay so actually okay it looks like the changes are just really really minor all right tell me who you are what I have to say Who I am alright then let's say UI I can't believe a change so simple ended up not being simple I finally thought I was going to have an easy one but okay so at least I can go back to the live chat while this is working alright great so I'm going to do get pull and I'll remember that one okay now unfortunately I won't really be able to see it on okay I guess if I want to try to test I was just thinking about testing these out I can just pull this down and then we can make sure that it's working so I'm gonna bring this over this is our local version just my server not working let's see okay this is our new one no it's not right this is still yeah it's yeah it's only one so okay so that's our new one so did fully changes down what's the other thing we have one of the lines up here I'm not going to try to find a line but all right so it looks like that's cool that works now we can go ahead with starting to get pull and I need to we got stopped right in the middle of that long line of command so we got stopped right at the get pull part so I'm just going to copy the rest of the command and paste it in there so we're going to do the art NPM install we're going to run a build process and then we're going to start ok so a little little inconvenience there but pretty much passed it all right so Sebastian says five hundred yeah maybe I'll stick to youtube tutorials he's refering to the Udacity course yeah I had the I signed up for it last week when I was on vacation and I actually had the page open to sign up for the course on my laptop for like two days before I made the decision finally to do it but I thought I don't know I thought it would motivate me since lately I've been really slacking on doing tutorials on my own I thought it would motivate me if I actually spent the money to do the course so the plan my plan is to wake up early before my kids wake up which can be challenging but to wake up early and do oh man more more problems so my plan is to wake up early and maybe like do a workout I have like a exercise bike in my basement so maybe I can do my work for this course while I'm doing you know a little workout in the morning and then maybe again like on my lunch break I'll do the course so I could probably get in like around 2 hours everyday if we with a course and then a little bit on Saturday I think it said like estimate is made 12 hours a week so if I do that then it should be good Monday or Monday through Saturday I put in 2 hours a day and it should be my twelve hours and it should work so hopefully it works out like that all right let's check out what's happening here who well this is not not good here so our build is not working all right Patrick says another reason not to make changes directly in production this is justification for a load balancer stuff you went through I was just thinking the same thing Patrick so yes if you I think I mentioned earlier but this site is using a load balancer so if one servers down everything gets directed to another server so right now the site I'm assuming is still up because the other server is fine so since we just since I don't know what just happened with this server then at least the site still up and somebody else asked something like like with what are you doing and I edited that but basically what we were trying to do is something really simple and it should have worked but basically some changes were made on directly on the server that it seems have messed some things up so we're trying to sort that out so let me this is just really weird um she this Patek is Jason yeah it's not like nothing's changed in my package.json I haven't really added I was trying to think if I added any packages since the last time I pushed anything to the server and I think no I really I don't think I've added anything on the master branch all the stuff that we've been doing has been on separate branches and it's not actually even been merged in one master so yeah so this should be let's see I realize we'll probably get the exact same issue but it's worth the try occasionally run something a second time and for some reason it works I also want to run this locally just to see if something's I do have you aren't installed locally so but I want to try to do it this in the same way way did it work that time you gotta be kidding me there's no way all right let's all right so the next command would be it works alright alright this is if anybody knows what just happened here fill me in but it's obviously the first time this was run we got all these errors the second time I got nothing oh well so I'm going to continue with the rest of the commands to restart this server and then we'll check it out so at this point we should just restart we're using PM 2 to start things up ok and what I want to do is I want to try to go directly to this IP I think if I go directly to that IP address I can get right to that server and won't get switched over to the other server so we want it to look like so basically we'll be able to tell if we've gone right to that server if it's worked if we if this area has changed significantly and say yep there we go okay so everything has changed correctly I'm just going to inspect really quick to see if we're getting any weird errors okay so we're getting this weird error a page does not exist speaking the truth and love conference so I'm trying to prefetch this page and maybe prefetching doesn't work with the dynamically yet so let me I do want to test this link hmm all right so that link doesn't work it's this actually did work locally so I did test it earlier this is from something I tried to do earlier today all right so aside from that which can be changed really quickly aside from that this is pretty much working so it's working enough that we can at least try to to test what we were going to we were initially trying to test so let me find my analytics and let's see actually let's make sure that we're one for today yeah looks like see two main site okay so it looks like we didn't have to do it in fact I completely forgot that by default Google Analytics doesn't show you the stuff from the current day so it was actually just showing me from like the last week or so I forget what the range was so when I set it to show today's stuff it actually did work from localist so that part worked so since we've kind of gotten into this big mess now anyway with the servers I am going to fix that quickly but basically this works so let's go back and let's add this I'm not going to update the other server just yet which is going to it shouldn't cause a problem for the two minutes that it's going to take to fix this so let's go over let's go over here back to our page and we need to do two things one on events we need to not prefetch let's see photos up here someone let me it's dumb yeah it's down here okay so and eventually all this stuff will be out of our code anyway and it will be pulled in through the WordPress API but for now for now let's get rid of this this prefetch and I'm wondering now should I get rid of whatever I should get rid of all of it let's just let's see I'm going to say that hopefully that'll fix the issue now you know it might not because we're still getting the 404 so let me bring it back that error here so the error is trying to go to saying this doesn't exist let's see if we'll get the same error see if we can go on our our test version of this which I'll pull it over so the test version let's inspect this okay so I'm not getting that error and our test version but I'm still I'm getting the 404 but then it then it works okay so now I am getting that error see I'm getting this error here so here's what we're going to do let's go that's that's really odd it's an odd air so basically I'm just going to remove this link and I'm not going to use the link I'm just going to use a regular a tag and we'll try that out and see if that works so see oh right all right let me check we're getting to the end I'm going to have to finish up soon for my three o'clock meeting so I'm going to check the live chat quickly just see if there's any questions you all have let's see all Patrick mentioned you could put that in a bastion alias oh that long string of commands that I copied and pasted in when we were trying to shut off the server and then update it and restart it he says you can put that in a bash alias and you can I do recommend doing that I just haven't done it yet but I do want to do that for now and especially because it's just me working on it for the most part it's just easy for me to just copy it over but it would be a better idea to to make a batch alias for it okay so we've taken this we've just made it a regular a tag let's click it and see what happens so I'm gonna see that looks good alright that looks good only bad thing is we're not getting our clientside routing you see we got a full page refresh I don't like that but I think it's ok it's ok for now I'm not sure if we can have the clientside routing when we've because for this we've used custom so we've edited our server ojs file and we've used some custom routing to use parameterised routing so that's like outside the scope of what next does so I'm thinking maybe the next clientside routing system can't work with that I don't know but for now this is good this gives us what we what we want for the most part so I'm going to stick with that and let's go back to alright so we had we were working in footage is so this worked I do want to make sure I want to see where else we have this goodness I wonder it's just going to you very much sooner yeah I don't think we need to track all these links like obviously to the privacy policy and things like that we don't need to track that so I think we're good we're good tracking that you said we have one in the sit in the head I mean maybe the nav yeah oops and there's my Google my calendar for my meeting oh yeah um okay so we need to track this yeah I need to check this let me make sure I'm a cantina okay I have ten minutes so let's do the same thing with this one hopefully it our class name stuff still works as well let's pull in this and we at nav and this react actually with time today you know I'm not going to do this right now because two things one I want to answer your questions and live chat also I want to make sure I sort out this server thing before I have my meeting so we'll stop here because I can always basically we've got it working so for the purpose of you know figuring out how to do this we've done it we've accomplished it we just need to apply the same thing to a few other places so that's worked what we need to do now is push our change up to github so the change we made to the to the length so we got rid of the prefetching to get rid of the clientside routing we just used to read your link and then that that fix the errors we were getting okay shoot okay so you see the areas we're getting where we define some things and never used it basically we added this and nav and we're not going to use it yet so we'll just add that back in at some point and then in footer not footer events we added in the link but then now we're not going to use that anymore so very useful to to check this stuff out beforehand and whoa okay I just saw this in the lab chat so Sebastian says check issue number 71 for react GA it says browsers block react GA length hmm that might be an issue I'm still going to push this change to fix the other thing but I'm going to come back to that after my meeting though and check out that issue because that could definitely a problem all right okay so if you're not familiar with github we've just committed our changes and then we're pushing them up to github on the master branch now I can go in here to our server and let me run our our set of commands that we've been copying so actually go back out the commands assume that I'm not already in the directory for the project so hopefully this all works now we don't get any errors we can test it quickly and hopefully it works all right let me go through world boss asks you have a bachelors yes I do have a bachelor's degree I have a bachelor's degree in business sharmi says usually master's degree for people who love to do research or an academics or the company requires that for our position yeah you're right a lot of times higher degrees are for research stuff I know at least the United States a lot of people get master's degrees in business and then they can get higher up in their organization even though they don't do any research that's so that's you know the only other reason that I've seen for them else like if you want to teach like normally they don't let you teach anything at a university unless you add the very least have a master's degree prefer a doctorate so that's another reason why some people get them all right so let's check it out and what do we have it maybe I pulled it over to a different place I think this was the one where we actually went see that pulled us over to the other server let me try to let me great try to grab the IP address again see if we can get straight there so see without with our load balancers right now is taking us to the older version of the site that's on our other server let's see hmm still taking us CEO sir mmm all right well let's let's see shoot I run this again okay okay so now we should be good to run run these commands okay all right back to the latch at get in this I have two minutes so sorry if I can't get to all your questions okay so it looks like looks like I'm going to I am going to need to check out the issue where with blouse browsers blocking blocking the links from react GA so um Patrick says it might be a target blank issue so I'm going to test that out after my meeting sorry didn't really have a Q&A this time get to it definitely next time hopefully I won't have another meeting tomorrow but anyway thank you all for for watching thanks for your help my meetings in one minute so I have to go but I should be back should be back tomorrow and if anybody has any helpful links I know you guys were talking about some issues and stuff please post it in the live chat or message me on Twitter or something because I do want to figure out this problem as soon as my meeting is over all right but anyway I'll see you tomorrow have a great day
