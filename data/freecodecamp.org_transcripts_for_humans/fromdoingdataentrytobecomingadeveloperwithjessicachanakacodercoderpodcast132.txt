With timestamps:

00:00 - the first one to two years were
00:02 - incredibly stressful because I
00:04 - constantly felt like I was going to fail
00:08 - and they were going to fire me for
00:10 - incompetence so it was a lot of Googling
00:13 - it was a lot of like looking up at deack
00:15 - overflow trying to do as much research
00:18 - on my own before I actually asked one of
00:21 - the other developers because I was also
00:23 - very afraid of annoying the other
00:25 - developers if I bug them too much with
00:27 - questions so it was like
00:30 - I would say it was pretty difficult for
00:32 - me at that time but I was learning so
00:34 - much like I think my brain was just like
00:36 - expanding with the amount of things I
00:38 - would learn
00:50 - [Music]
01:11 - welcome back to the free Cod Camp
01:13 - podcast I'm Quincy Larsson teacher and
01:15 - founder of freecodecamp.org each week
01:18 - we're bringing you Insight from
01:19 - developers Founders and ambitious people
01:22 - getting into Tech this week we're joined
01:24 - by Jessica Chand AKA coder coder she's a
01:29 - soft software engineer who has worked in
01:31 - the field for more than a decade and
01:33 - interestingly she studied Photography in
01:35 - school and she never even took a
01:37 - programming class uh and yet she's had
01:40 - this illustrious career so we're going
01:42 - to learn a lot from her welcome Jessica
01:45 - yeah thanks so much for having me yeah I
01:48 - uh I've been a longtime admirer of your
01:51 - work uh of the caliber of your husband's
01:54 - animation sound design like all the
01:56 - production you put into these amazing uh
01:59 - video courses that you create and just
02:01 - your fun sense of humor and like it's
02:04 - just like if there was like a word to
02:06 - describe Cod or quer I would describe it
02:08 - as
02:09 - like fun I mean that may seem kind of
02:11 - like a like a short word to describe it
02:13 - but it is fun to watch your videos
02:16 - that's awesome yeah thank you that is
02:18 - definitely one one thing we we aim for
02:20 - with the the videos yeah so I want to
02:23 - like go way back as we always do and
02:25 - just start with like kind of how you got
02:27 - into Tech because my understanding is
02:29 - you don't have any formal training en
02:31 - coding and in fact like your career kind
02:35 - of like evaporated early on as the field
02:38 - just fundamentally changed and uh you
02:40 - you found yourself like working kind of
02:42 - like in those kind of temp office type
02:44 - jobs and stuff uh for quite a while like
02:47 - but before we get to that like maybe you
02:49 - can talk a little bit about your early
02:50 - days and your early
02:53 - Ambitions yeah so as you said I didn't
02:56 - you know go to school for anything
02:58 - programming wise but I was always into
03:01 - computers even from a pretty young age
03:04 - um like I remember going to the library
03:06 - and checking out like a book on basic
03:08 - programming and trying to like do that
03:10 - on the computer at home um and then also
03:13 - in I think it was middle school or High
03:15 - School my sister and I ran a BBS this is
03:19 - pre internet days a bullet and board
03:20 - system so that was and that was
03:23 - something that I kind of set up myself
03:25 - um and yeah that was super fun um back
03:30 - in the back in those days yeah how do
03:32 - bbs's work I mean I know because I used
03:34 - to use them but but like what is running
03:38 - it a BBS like uh of course that's like a
03:40 - major plot point in the show Halt and
03:42 - Catch Fire like uh they set up a BBS in
03:45 - the 80s but maybe maybe you could talk
03:47 - about what that was like cuz yeah how
03:51 - did you get special software did you
03:53 - have like a special
03:54 - server um we ran it off of one of the
03:57 - computers that we had at home so we had
03:59 - two computers at home so one of them you
04:01 - would have to run the software to run
04:03 - the BBS and people would actually have
04:05 - to physically call your the phone number
04:08 - attached to the computer in order to
04:11 - connect to the BBS from their computer
04:14 - um with these different protocols and
04:16 - everything was sort of asy art you know
04:20 - very slow slow speeds like 2400 bod
04:23 - modems and all that kind of stuff um but
04:27 - yeah you could log into the BBS you
04:29 - could there were message boards there
04:31 - were games you could play they were
04:33 - actually really fun you could also
04:34 - upload and download files so yeah it was
04:37 - just a way for people to find community
04:40 - and just like you know have fun in their
04:41 - spare time yeah and what kind of
04:45 - software did you have on that because I
04:46 - remember like when I dial into a BBS
04:48 - there would be like places you could
04:49 - like leave messages for other people
04:51 - kind of like a like an altnet uh uset
04:54 - like precursor uh but there were also
04:57 - lots of interactive games where you
04:58 - could only do so much every day so it
05:00 - like encouraged you to come back the
05:01 - next day and like bu buff up the stats
05:04 - of your character and like explore it
05:06 - was like kind of like text based
05:07 - Adventure type stuff yeah for sure um I
05:11 - ran it off of a software called Renegade
05:14 - so you could you didn't have to code it
05:16 - from scratch so you could download these
05:18 - BBS software packages I guess and then
05:21 - install them on your computer and so you
05:24 - didn't have to do any actual programming
05:25 - to really set it up you just had to kind
05:27 - of install it and configure it um so
05:31 - yeah no programming needed what do
05:33 - people use it
05:35 - for I used it to play games they were
05:37 - really fun um there was like legend of
05:40 - the red dragon the sort of D and D
05:42 - themed game where you you know fought
05:44 - monsters and try to get gold um there's
05:48 - also kind of a Star Wars themed game
05:49 - called trade Wars where you would trade
05:52 - different um resources and you could
05:55 - like save up to get like the
05:57 - Enterprise type uh ship and they like
06:01 - fangi and stuff yeah it was it was fun
06:04 - fun times that's pretty cool so it's
06:06 - basically like kind of like a Commerce
06:07 - simulator where you you have like uh
06:10 - yeah that sounds fun and how many people
06:13 - could use the BBS concurrently like did
06:15 - you have multiple phone lines um it was
06:18 - limited to one person per phone line and
06:20 - we only had one phone
06:21 - line
06:23 - so yeah how did how did uh your parents
06:26 - feel about like having that phone line
06:28 - tied up all the time we yeah we're
06:30 - pretty I would I guess privileged
06:32 - because my parents were willing to pay
06:34 - for a second phone line that was
06:36 - dedicated to the
06:38 - BBS um but yeah I limited to one person
06:40 - at a time which is kind of mind-blowing
06:44 - you know considering nowadays everything
06:45 - is like happening at the same time yeah
06:48 - maybe you could talk about like how you
06:49 - get the word out as a kid like did you
06:51 - just tell your friends at school or like
06:53 - how did people discover that there was
06:54 - this phone number they could dial into
06:56 - with their modem and play games and
06:58 - stuff I think there were places you
07:00 - could list your BBS but my sister and I
07:02 - were members of other local bbs's and
07:06 - had made friends and stuff so you just
07:08 - kind of tell your friends about your own
07:10 - BBS and because ours was smaller it was
07:13 - you were less likely to get a busy
07:15 - signal when you tried to call in which I
07:17 - think the friends really liked so it was
07:19 - kind of like a just like a hangout place
07:23 - um for like us and our online friends
07:25 - yeah I mean that's so cool because it's
07:27 - like very local I mean it yeah I don't
07:30 - know if there's like a an equivalent on
07:31 - the internet right now because
07:33 - everything is concurrent like just
07:35 - because I'm looking at somebody's
07:36 - Instagram feed doesn't mean somebody
07:38 - else can't also look at it right or any
07:40 - sort of synchronous like chat type
07:42 - experience like using slack or using uh
07:45 - Discord or something like that like
07:47 - everything you just take for granted
07:48 - that it's like a multi-tenant operation
07:51 - right um yeah so yeah I can imagine all
07:54 - the constraints in terms and and also
07:55 - the fact that it's like dealing with
07:57 - extremely low amounts of data so
07:59 - everything text ask text yeah that's so
08:02 - cool like it was a different world how
08:05 - did you even discover like how did it
08:08 - like pop in your mind because I would
08:09 - use other people's bbs's but it never
08:11 - occurred to me like I should create a
08:12 - BBS on my own like what do you remember
08:15 - like was there like some uh moment of
08:17 - Revelation like I could do
08:19 - this I think looking back I think I've
08:22 - always had this interest in building
08:26 - things
08:27 - so before I became web developer I
08:30 - taught myself HTML and basic CSS in high
08:33 - school like this is back in the geoc C's
08:35 - days and I just would kind of make blogs
08:39 - for myself but it wasn't because I had
08:41 - all these things I wanted to say it's
08:42 - because I just enjoyed setting up the
08:45 - the blog websites and I remember my
08:46 - friend was like sort of making fun of me
08:49 - a little bit because I kept just like
08:50 - having new blogs and I would have to
08:52 - send her like the new link every time um
08:54 - but it didn't really sort of cement in
08:57 - my understanding that like I enjoyed
08:59 - making making you know blogs after blogs
09:01 - cuz I enjoyed building websites um but
09:04 - yeah I think I just always liked making
09:06 - things and Building
09:08 - Things yeah well um maybe you can talk a
09:12 - little bit about like your early days
09:14 - and and you know what your aspirations
09:16 - were around High School
09:19 - age um I think in high school I was
09:22 - probably I was a very goody two shoes
09:25 - and I think I wanted to be a doctor um
09:28 - cuz my dad he's tired now but he was a
09:30 - doctor um so I think that was kind of
09:34 - the the limits of my aspirations for
09:37 - some reason I didn't realize that like
09:39 - you could be a web developer or a
09:41 - programmer back then I'm not sure why
09:44 - but I just I didn't really think about
09:46 - you know what job out of all the jobs in
09:48 - the world can I do I think I just sort
09:50 - of had a very limited sort mind mindset
09:52 - at that point yeah and I think that's
09:55 - that's a common thing uh among like a
09:57 - lot of people that come on the fre
09:59 - cocaine podcast is like they have like
10:01 - this mentality like oh I'll be like a
10:03 - doctor or a lawyer or a dentist or or
10:05 - some kind of other type of engineer like
10:07 - because that's what the people you know
10:10 - that are older than me seem to be doing
10:11 - in these Social Circles and they seem to
10:13 - be doing well they've got like the house
10:15 - and they they've got you know stable
10:17 - income and they they're eventually going
10:18 - to be able to retire and stuff like that
10:20 - so so you kind of look at those people
10:21 - and you're like wow if I just had a lot
10:23 - of money and I could basically just do
10:25 - whatever I want and like have like a
10:27 - really good you know sound system or
10:28 - whatever it was you know we aspired to
10:30 - when we were kids you you kind of like
10:33 - look at the job as just something you do
10:35 - as a means to an end to just have a
10:37 - relaxing enjoyable life and and be able
10:39 - to have a family and stuff like that
10:40 - like that's how a lot of people I think
10:44 - look at uh when they're younger they're
10:46 - just like okay what do I do that like
10:48 - being a doctor you get tons of respect
10:50 - right uh like people call you
10:54 - doctor right and and like if if if
10:57 - somebody like has like a collapses on
10:59 - the sidewalk or something they're like
11:00 - is there a doctor and you run over and
11:01 - everybody parts to make way for you so I
11:04 - can definitely understand why like I
11:05 - would definitely say that's the most
11:07 - common thing that people who come on the
11:08 - free C Camp podcast want to be when they
11:10 - grow up as a doctor uh but for you that
11:13 - that wasn't in the cards and it probably
11:15 - wasn't for academic reasons but like why
11:18 - did you ultimately not decide to
11:21 - pursue yeah um yeah I think the the
11:26 - doctor thing didn't last very long um so
11:29 - College I took I think intro to
11:32 - chemistry and I almost failed it and I
11:34 - think after that class I was like I
11:36 - don't think this is for me because I
11:37 - knew the classes would only get harder
11:38 - and harder with like organic chemistry
11:40 - and like all this kind of stuff so I
11:43 - dropped that and then I didn't know what
11:45 - to major in and I eventually took a
11:48 - drawing class and I loved it and this
11:51 - art is something that I had done you
11:54 - know since high school I took a lot of
11:56 - Art and photography classes in high
11:58 - school and I just you know really
12:00 - enjoyed that so I thought oh maybe I'll
12:04 - try majoring in art so that's kind of
12:06 - how I got into majoring in photography
12:09 - in school that's so interesting like I I
12:12 - just assume because you're like frankly
12:13 - you're like a really smart person like I
12:16 - definitely look at you and say she's
12:17 - probably like way smarter than me um and
12:20 - the reason I think that uh you know like
12:24 - if you look at like the caliber of your
12:26 - work and the way you carry yourself and
12:28 - talk and and stuff like this person is
12:29 - extremely organized and so I just
12:32 - presumed oh it's probably not an
12:33 - academic reason do you ever wonder if
12:35 - like that was like a weer class or some
12:37 - sort of like like that if you could have
12:39 - actually probably like powered through
12:42 - uh doing like Premed and then medical
12:44 - school and stuff like that or do you
12:45 - genuinely think it wasn't you didn't
12:46 - have it in
12:47 - you I think I could have I think the the
12:50 - problem this is I think this is just my
12:53 - personal
12:54 - situation I like didn't have a really
12:57 - big social life in high school I didn't
12:59 - really have that many friends that I
13:00 - would hang out with so the only thing I
13:02 - had to do was study and read books so
13:04 - that's basically all I did when I was
13:06 - younger then I went to college and you
13:08 - know college is like this new experience
13:10 - you meet all these new people so I had a
13:12 - lot of friends and so I in high school I
13:15 - didn't have to really have time
13:17 - management skills where I'm choosing to
13:19 - study over doing something fun but in
13:21 - college I ended up doing a lot of fun
13:24 - things as opposed to studying so I would
13:26 - like routinely hang out with people and
13:28 - then I would have to stay up till like
13:30 - 3:00 a.m. studying and trying to finish
13:32 - my work um or I would just stay up till
13:35 - 3:00 a.m. cuz I was hanging out with
13:36 - people so like yeah I did not have great
13:40 - time management skills like at all um
13:43 - when I was in college which is sad to
13:45 - say but that's kind of what happened so
13:47 - I think that's that's the reason why it
13:49 - didn't really work out but I I don't
13:51 - think I would have enjoyed all the
13:53 - different science classes to be
13:55 - honest yeah yeah so you're into art um
14:00 - so to to resolve that tangent you're
14:01 - into art and uh you're interested uh
14:04 - like like where does this drawing class
14:07 - take you in terms of like what's your
14:08 - progression as a creative thinker and
14:11 - and
14:13 - maker um yeah so I think the drawing
14:16 - class the the
14:18 - professor actually was like asking me
14:21 - she she was a painter who was doing like
14:23 - a temporary thing at my school and she
14:26 - was like I why are you not majoring in
14:29 - art so I think I just took that as a big
14:31 - compliment which you know was and that's
14:33 - kind of how I decided to you know major
14:37 - in that um but in terms of artistic uh
14:42 - skills or whatever I think that I
14:45 - actually didn't learn very much
14:47 - photography at all because my professor
14:49 - was very hands-off so he would just say
14:51 - all right go take pictures and then we
14:52 - would take pictures and develop them and
14:53 - print them and then we would like hang
14:55 - them up and have critiques and that was
14:57 - it he didn't really like teach us very
14:59 - much so I actually taught
15:01 - myself more after college um cuz I lived
15:05 - in Boston for a long time and I was
15:08 - unemployed for about a month after I
15:09 - moved there so all I did was walk around
15:11 - the city and with my little Sony point
15:14 - and shoot camera and I just like shot
15:16 - photos all around the city for you know
15:19 - that became one of my hobbies and I
15:21 - think that kind of practice over and
15:24 - over helped me to really develop better
15:27 - photographic skills
15:29 - so I'm yeah I feel like you can teach
15:33 - yourself a lot just through trying
15:35 - things yeah 100% I I can I can get
15:39 - behind that sentiment because that's how
15:41 - I like kind of root Force learning
15:42 - coding and other things like that and it
15:44 - sounds like so one interesting note
15:46 - about what you're there was actually a
15:48 - study like and I'm always like really
15:52 - load the quote like social science
15:54 - studies because they can't necessarily
15:55 - be uh reproduced the finings can't be
15:58 - reproduced NE early but uh I think there
16:01 - was like they B it was photography and
16:05 - and they they had like some Professor
16:06 - who basically said like told some of the
16:08 - students like I want you to just take
16:10 - one picture but I want it to be a really
16:12 - good one and the other one just go take
16:13 - a ton of pictures and it turned out that
16:15 - the people that just incidentally took a
16:17 - whole lot of pictures like they were
16:19 - practicing and their their photos were
16:21 - better subjectively how how do you judge
16:23 - a better photo but like yeah the the the
16:26 - researchers found that like the the
16:28 - students or the professors like like
16:30 - that I'm sorry I'm totally butchering
16:31 - the findings but the point of the study
16:33 - was that like it you know you can stand
16:36 - all day there and talk about the theory
16:38 - what what you know makes for a good
16:40 - composition of a shot what's like the
16:42 - hierarchy and like all these other
16:43 - different considerations right I know
16:44 - nothing about photography uh
16:46 - but but at the same time like if you
16:49 - just go out and practice the actual
16:50 - skill maybe a lot of this you'll into it
16:52 - and you'll build it up so maybe your
16:53 - professor was kind of like the the
16:55 - equivalent of like those old uh you know
16:57 - um the master from the Kung Fu movies
17:00 - like standing there pass you know you
17:05 - know basically just just giving you like
17:08 - very vinary feedback on your work but it
17:10 - does sound like you some critique right
17:13 - um but but like maybe he had kind of
17:16 - internalized that like to become a good
17:19 - photographer you just got to go out and
17:20 - take a lot of photos right a lot of a
17:22 - lot of shots on goal so to speak um yeah
17:25 - that's cool so you you were living in
17:27 - Boston so this is after college we can
17:29 - we can go to Life After College right
17:33 - like for a photography major um which I
17:39 - mean I I think if you took like all the
17:40 - different college majors and you rank
17:41 - them like you know Premed and like
17:43 - software engineering and things like
17:44 - that like computer science I think is
17:46 - like the highest compensating degree you
17:47 - can study overall like over like the
17:49 - next 20 years like something like that
17:51 - but
17:53 - like if you were to stack rank those
17:56 - like I'm pretty sure photography would
17:58 - be toward the bottom in terms of like
18:01 - remunerative careers I apologize if you
18:03 - can hear like some lawnmowing stuff this
18:05 - is just like that one day of the month
18:07 - can you is that coming through to you at
18:08 - all I cannot hear it so I think you're
18:11 - good yeah well it dodged I don't have to
18:14 - go out and like politely asked the
18:16 - gentleman to like come back later okay
18:20 - so um yeah so I guess my point is like
18:24 - no no shade at all the photography
18:25 - Majors like I uh you know I'm an English
18:27 - major so that's also toward the bottom
18:29 - of the list but like when you arrive at
18:31 - Boston what are you thinking like why
18:33 - did you move to Boston first of all cuz
18:35 - that's like a big expensive city and
18:37 - like you said you were unemployed for a
18:39 - month like did you have a job lined up
18:41 - or what what were your what was your
18:42 - thinking at this point in your life I I
18:45 - went I was like kind of already in the
18:47 - New England area and some of my friends
18:49 - had moved to Boston already so it seemed
18:52 - like the next logical step to just kind
18:54 - of move to the nearest big city um but
18:56 - yeah I looking back I can't I almost
18:59 - can't believe I did this but I just was
19:01 - like okay I'll just move there I'll find
19:02 - a job once I'm there um and the only
19:06 - thought I had was I'm going to try to be
19:07 - an artist because that was the only like
19:11 - I guess job that they really talked
19:14 - about at school they didn't really train
19:16 - us
19:17 - to yeah think about other jobs like you
19:21 - know I don't know going into advertising
19:22 - or other things like that being a
19:24 - commercial photographer like everything
19:26 - was about about the fine art stuff
19:29 - so anyway in Boston I was just looking
19:32 - for jobs related to photography and so I
19:35 - just called up all the Photo Labs in the
19:37 - area and one of them like ended up
19:39 - giving me a job so that's kind of how I
19:41 - fell into I worked in a commercial photo
19:44 - lab and yeah that was a that was a fun
19:48 - experience but I did not make much money
19:49 - at all so when you say like a photo lab
19:52 - like where you going to get your photos
19:53 - developed like with the chemicals and
19:55 - stuff yep yeah so they they serviced
19:59 - commercial um photographers so it was a
20:03 - really large lab the professional
20:05 - photographers would come in with all
20:07 - their roles of film from their shoots
20:08 - and we would develop them we had a film
20:10 - guy who just all he did all day was
20:12 - develop all the film um and my job was
20:15 - to make contact sheets from the strips
20:17 - of film where you can see it's like the
20:20 - size of the negatives but you can see
20:21 - what's on them um before
20:23 - printing um so that was one of my jobs
20:26 - but yeah that was a it was a really fun
20:28 - experience but but definitely not
20:30 - doesn't exist as much anymore today yeah
20:33 - yeah I mean with the EV a digital
20:35 - photography that like kind of like
20:37 - probably made that industry go the way
20:39 - of like buggy whips like there are still
20:42 - some people that sell buggy whips like
20:44 - there there are like multi hundredy old
20:46 - companies that produce these buggy whips
20:48 - and it could be that like 100 years from
20:50 - now there are still Photo Labs but
20:52 - they're going to be probably very Niche
20:55 - yes and yeah it's not like a giant
20:57 - industry anymore right uh like I
20:59 - wouldn't be surprised if that that
21:00 - industry had undergone like a 90% you
21:03 - know reduction over the past 20 years
21:05 - for sure if not more so okay so you're
21:08 - working in this photo lab uh servicing
21:10 - uh professional uh you know
21:12 - photographers probably like wedding
21:13 - photographers the people that do like
21:15 - yearbook I don't know like who who are
21:18 - the commercial what are what are the
21:19 - jobs in photography how did how did the
21:21 - photography industry work at the time um
21:24 - from what I could tell just from the
21:25 - people coming in they were like um
21:27 - commercial portrait photographers they
21:29 - do you know newspaper and magazine
21:31 - photos there were wedding photographers
21:34 - um and there also some just like fine
21:36 - artists who would come in um and they
21:38 - would have us print their their photos
21:41 - for them um so it was it was kind of a
21:43 - range I'm sure there were some like
21:45 - hobbyist photographers who were just
21:47 - kind of doing it for fun too yeah did
21:50 - did you have any ankling like hey I
21:51 - could do what they're doing and like go
21:53 - out and like make kind of like a
21:55 - consultancy out of this or like be a
21:57 - freelance photographer
21:59 - I don't know why well I sort of tried I
22:01 - did sort of second shooting for some
22:04 - wedding photographers and I interned
22:06 - with one of the commercial photographers
22:07 - who came in but for some reason it never
22:10 - really stuck with me in terms of oh this
22:12 - is something I want to
22:13 - do um it just seemed like I think I just
22:17 - didn't know how to even break into the
22:19 - field and I didn't have enough of a
22:22 - maybe desire to be a photographer to do
22:26 - the research to figure out how to do the
22:27 - business side of things things
22:30 - so yeah yeah I mean this is kind of
22:33 - like sorry I didn't mean to interrupt
22:35 - you there's a little bit of legy uh yeah
22:38 - this is like an indictment of higher
22:40 - education that you studied photography
22:43 - for like four years and you still have
22:45 - like no idea how to actually like go out
22:46 - and make money as a photographer and and
22:49 - you're not even sure that you would want
22:51 - to even if you knew how but you know
22:54 - college just kind of put you onto this
22:56 - track and they give you a major
22:58 - important major and then there's so much
23:00 - momentum behind it and it's so hard to
23:02 - switch but I mean it does sound to me
23:04 - kind of
23:05 - like
23:07 - uh if I can like be probably over
23:10 - prescriptive in hand wavy but it sounds
23:11 - like you know uh you said you didn't
23:15 - have a a big interesting social life uh
23:18 - when you were younger you go to college
23:20 - college is where a lot of people if
23:21 - you're fortunate enough to go to college
23:23 - like their social life kind of burgeons
23:24 - and the whole world opens up right it's
23:27 - not just like High School never ends
23:29 - type uh you know clicky things it's like
23:31 - real people kind of like becoming
23:34 - friends and and around common interests
23:36 - and stuff like that and a lot of that
23:37 - kind of like high school nonsense kind
23:39 - of like breaks down to an extent like
23:42 - once you get out of like fraternity
23:43 - sority spheres and stuff uh and I'm not
23:46 - trying to like knock those or anything
23:48 - but like I was never in a fraternity and
23:49 - like I didn't have a lot of respect for
23:51 - like the fraternities and stuff like we
23:53 - we always kind of looked a SCS at them
23:55 - if that's how you pronounce the word
23:57 - like oh you know like that's like we're
23:58 - here to learn you know like like I kind
24:01 - of like elevated myself above like the
24:03 - people doing like you know drinking
24:05 - excessively and stuff like that so um
24:08 - but it sounds like you had kind of like
24:10 - a social Awakening in college and then
24:13 - uh maybe the fact that that that was all
24:16 - happening distracted you from academics
24:18 - to an extent and when the professor was
24:21 - like oh you should consider being an
24:22 - artist or wanting to switch to Art
24:24 - you're like sure it doesn't sound like
24:26 - there was like a ton of Liberation and
24:29 - like long-term planning during those
24:32 - four years would you agree with that
24:33 - sentiment I I don't want to
24:34 - mischaracterize it no I would definitely
24:36 - agree I think I just didn't know what
24:38 - was possible so you don't know what you
24:40 - don't know and I didn't really
24:43 - understand how I needed to think about
24:45 - trying to find a
24:47 - career or you know choosing you know
24:50 - which one I wanted to do um so I think
24:53 - it was yeah a lot of fumbling and just
24:56 - not really knowing what what I wanted in
24:59 - life I think back
25:00 - then but you're in Boston this very
25:03 - expensive city uh very you know
25:05 - prestigious City like that's where like
25:08 - Harvard is MIT there's so many uh like
25:11 - big important companies based out of
25:13 - Boston there's so much research being
25:15 - done there it's it's like a really
25:17 - important and it's one of the oldest
25:18 - cities in the United States so it's got
25:20 - like this very long stored history and
25:23 - um and you're just kind of working at a
25:26 - photo lab and like
25:29 - did you feel like ambition going to and
25:32 - from work every day like at what point
25:34 - did the more ambitious Jessica Chan
25:36 - start to materialize the one that we all
25:38 - know and respect
25:40 - today I think it took a while I think I
25:43 - I really just didn't know what I wanted
25:46 - to do when I was in my 20s so I think it
25:49 - wasn't really until I started working um
25:54 - at this small web dev shop in Boston
25:58 - that I was thinking oh I can like sort
26:00 - of stay here and learn how to program
26:03 - they were doing like sort of backend
26:05 - like database work that's kind of where
26:07 - I started um how did you get how did you
26:09 - get that
26:11 - job um so as you probably saw in my like
26:14 - YouTube video I did a lot of temp office
26:17 - jobs for I would say a few years so this
26:20 - is just you know like it was fine work
26:22 - but um it wasn't something that I
26:25 - necessarily felt passionate about but I
26:28 - was looking for a job at one point cuz
26:30 - my like temp work had ended or whatever
26:33 - and I looked on Craigslist for just
26:36 - random jobs and I was like oh I could
26:38 - probably do data entry because that was
26:39 - one of the things that I'd done at my
26:41 - temp jobs so I found this data entry
26:43 - position in Boston and it ended up being
26:46 - at this small web dev shop and I got the
26:50 - job there started out doing data entry
26:52 - but then they ended up teaching me like
26:54 - SQL database work and doing net um
26:58 - programming and Microsoft Access for
27:01 - those of you who remember um so yeah
27:04 - there was that was kind of like
27:07 - my entrance into like the world of web
27:10 - development even though I had taught
27:11 - myself how to build websites when I was
27:13 - younger it was always just something I
27:15 - did for fun and it just never clicked in
27:17 - my brain that this is something that
27:19 - people can get a job in and also make
27:22 - like really good money so for some
27:25 - reason it just took me falling into that
27:27 - job and
27:28 - realizing like oh I have these like
27:30 - skills that I can develop and then use
27:33 - to apply for you know actual web
27:36 - development jobs cuz the job that I got
27:38 - from Craigslist was like very contract
27:40 - like temporary stuff yeah yeah it's
27:44 - almost like Destiny's way of like you
27:47 - know repeatedly like shoving you in this
27:49 - direction yeah um so so you're starting
27:53 - to learn the skills how do you go about
27:55 - learning this giant Corpus of knowledge
27:57 - it sounds like you already knew a little
27:59 - bit about you know Microsoft access
28:01 - database tool that comes with Microsoft
28:03 - Office like the PowerPoint everybody
28:05 - knows how to use PowerPoint everybody
28:06 - knows how to use Excel and Word but not
28:09 - as many people know how to use access
28:11 - because yeah the learning curve is a
28:13 - little bit steeper um but it sounds like
28:15 - you were you were learning relevant Tech
28:17 - skills just on the job and you were
28:20 - being pushed in this more technical
28:21 - Direction like do you remember a clear
28:24 - point where somebody entrusted you with
28:26 - actually building something do you
28:28 - remember what your first project
28:30 - was I mean I started out and I think
28:32 - this is what I think people realize when
28:35 - you get your first job in programming or
28:37 - web development or whatever is that
28:39 - you're not necessarily going to be
28:40 - tasked with building this entire giant
28:42 - project from scratch most likely you're
28:44 - going to be given tasks to do in
28:47 - existing projects that the company
28:48 - already has had running so that's what I
28:50 - did so I had to work on this website and
28:55 - I had to for example you know add or
28:57 - subtract um drop down menu items so I
29:00 - had to learn how to do that so it's very
29:02 - like task by task based or I had to
29:05 - learn how to um make changes to the
29:08 - websites that they needed with CSS or um
29:12 - just like learning how to run reports
29:14 - and write reports and SQL to get you
29:18 - know data from one of their clients so
29:20 - it was very much like I need to do this
29:22 - thing because my boss told me to if I
29:24 - don't know how to do it I need to figure
29:26 - it out
29:30 - yeah so uh essentially you had the
29:33 - benefit of having somebody tell you what
29:35 - to do and give you these missions and
29:37 - then each mission was like a growth
29:38 - opportunity uh and and how did you
29:41 - figure stuff out like because again you
29:44 - have no formal programming training you
29:46 - are a hobbyist like web designer I guess
29:49 - um and you have very rudimentary skills
29:51 - probably but you do have the benefit of
29:53 - kind of like a sense of Aesthetics you
29:55 - have like an eye from photography and
29:57 - from taking art class and stuff like
29:58 - that uh maybe you could talk about like
30:01 - the like your Ascent as far as like
30:04 - gaining more confidence uh in your
30:07 - abilities as you ran these kind of like
30:09 - fetch Quests for your for your
30:12 - boss yeah I think like looking back I
30:14 - honestly really lucked out with that job
30:17 - um it paid pretty terribly and also like
30:20 - I wasn't paid for eight hours a day I
30:22 - was only paid for like the actual tasks
30:24 - that they could build to their clients
30:26 - so depending on how busy they were it I
30:28 - might only have like 30 minutes or like
30:30 - a couple hours a day but what I did
30:34 - learn was how to learn or how to find
30:36 - solutions to things um because my boss
30:40 - would explain one time how to do
30:43 - something like how to you know run a
30:45 - squl query and how to write it and then
30:48 - I would have to do the same thing for a
30:50 - similar task and he got very grumpy if I
30:54 - had to ask him how if I had to ask him
30:56 - to explain something to me more than
30:58 - once so he actually would give me um and
31:03 - I think there were a couple other people
31:04 - working there at the time we all had
31:06 - notebooks that we had to leave at the
31:08 - office and we had to take notes um so if
31:11 - he would explain something I would write
31:13 - it down how to do it and then if I had
31:16 - to do the same task in the future I
31:17 - could just refer back to my notebook and
31:19 - be like oh this is how to do it and then
31:21 - if you do that five or 10 times
31:23 - eventually you learn how to do it
31:25 - without having to refer to your notes so
31:28 - that process times you know a hundred or
31:31 - however many times I just learned
31:34 - everything kind of Peace
31:36 - Meal which was one way to learn I think
31:39 - it worked out for me um because you
31:41 - learn real skills applicable skills like
31:45 - right away um you know I didn't learn
31:47 - things from a class and then have to
31:49 - figure out how that works in the real
31:51 - world later on so it was it was an
31:54 - interesting way to learn I'm not sure
31:58 - if that way exists as much anymore
32:00 - because this is back before coding boot
32:03 - camps existed so in some ways timing
32:06 - wise I really was fortunate in in terms
32:09 - of being able to find this job and also
32:12 - use my skills to land another Junior Dev
32:15 - job um a couple years later so I think
32:18 - the world has just changed a lot from
32:20 - that um but you know that's how it was
32:24 - for
32:26 - me I mean what you describe doesn't
32:29 - sound unlike what like a blacksmith
32:31 - might do to like an apprentice thousands
32:33 - of years ago right or maybe hundreds of
32:35 - years ago uh where it's like I already
32:38 - showed you how to do this like almost
32:39 - kind of like a cartoon like if you ever
32:41 - seen the old Sam Remy Spider-Man movies
32:43 - The Cigar chomping boss with like the
32:45 - the buzz cut and he's sitting back in
32:47 - his he's like Parker I told you to do
32:49 - this this and this you know kind of like
32:51 - very um I guess uh he has very high
32:54 - standards for you and what you're going
32:56 - to get done right um very much trial by
32:58 - fire yeah and that Trial By Fire Man the
33:02 - the lawnmowing is really intensifying
33:04 - again I apologize uh if anybody hears
33:07 - like you know what sounds like a
33:08 - helicopter
33:09 - landing it's very faint okay good good
33:12 - good good uh thank you for reassuring me
33:14 - that uh as I'm very openly say like at
33:18 - free camp we don't do anything of these
33:20 - podcasts like this is unfiltered like
33:24 - unfolding in real time right uh and for
33:26 - me that's like exciting it's exciting
33:29 - that there are a bunch of men with
33:31 - hoodies and leaf blowers outside my
33:33 - window like playing a part in this
33:35 - recording so uh yeah it sounds like you
33:39 - learned a ton from that opportunity even
33:42 - though it was probably like um it was
33:45 - like a certain window of time when it
33:48 - was like the Wild West in programming
33:49 - and technology and there weren't there
33:52 - wasn't really the expectation maybe that
33:53 - somebody would have formally studied
33:55 - programming and computer science or they
33:57 - if they studied that they probably
33:58 - studied a bunch of Applied Mathematics
34:00 - they didn't study how to build websites
34:02 - and how to do do and a lot of this these
34:05 - Technologies were kind of being invented
34:07 - on the fly during that era um so you
34:10 - don't necessarily have comprehensive
34:12 - textbooks maybe you go to like a a
34:14 - Barnes & Noble or a borders and you get
34:16 - like did you ever get like the big fat
34:18 - books like um on different Technologies
34:21 - like yeah yeah like um I have quite a
34:24 - few that I actually need to donate
34:26 - because I don't read them
34:28 - yeah well um I mean do you remember that
34:31 - era like uh of just going into a big
34:34 - bookstore and just be like wow like so
34:37 - much knowledge all this knowledge is
34:38 - right here yeah I need to buy this book
34:41 - and then there was like a CD ROM in the
34:43 - back oh yeah of course yep in the
34:45 - classic sleeve yeah very cool well so it
34:50 - sounds like you learned a tremendous
34:52 - amount there and I I'm excited to learn
34:53 - a little bit more about what transpar
34:55 - because it sounds like you you were kind
34:56 - of going through the the proverbial uh
34:59 - learning process but you were doing it
35:00 - in a way that most people don't do it
35:02 - because most people uh nowadays in 2024
35:05 - like just use freeo Camp to learn or
35:08 - they use some combination of courses
35:10 - like the courses you've developed uh or
35:13 - or you know video based courses or um
35:16 - they may use some books uh still to
35:19 - learn different Technologies like
35:20 - everybody learns a little bit different
35:22 - but to actually be in a shop with other
35:25 - devs kind of like almost kind of like I
35:27 - think of it as like um I mean I keep
35:30 - coming back to like a newsroom feel cuz
35:32 - it does feel like an editor just sending
35:34 - you out like giving you assignments and
35:36 - I worked in newspapers for a while and
35:38 - that was very much what it was like it
35:39 - was extremely hands off and you just
35:41 - like learned from your peers you learned
35:42 - from reading the New York Times every
35:44 - day and seeing what they were doing like
35:46 - like were you going to like Coca-Cola's
35:49 - website and like looking at their like
35:50 - interaction design and stuff like that
35:51 - and trying to learn from it or were you
35:53 - studying a lot of work that was out in
35:56 - you know in the wild
35:58 - to be honest I didn't because I was so
36:01 - overwhelmed with the work I had to do
36:04 - for my job during the day um and this is
36:07 - this is more like after I left that sort
36:09 - of temp job and was able to work at an
36:10 - advertising agency like that was like
36:13 - drinking from a fire hose in terms of I
36:16 - just had to like change this button on
36:17 - this landing page but like I knew that I
36:19 - had to get it done like in less than a
36:22 - day or a few hours because you know I
36:24 - need to meet my deadline so like it was
36:28 - I would say that the first
36:30 - three years the first one to two years
36:33 - were incredibly stressful because I
36:37 - constantly felt like I was going to fail
36:40 - and they were going to fire me for
36:42 - incompetence so it was a lot of Googling
36:45 - it was a lot of like looking up at stack
36:47 - Overflow trying to do as much research
36:50 - on my own before I actually asked one of
36:53 - the other developers because I was also
36:55 - very afraid of annoying the other
36:57 - Developers is if I bug them too much
36:58 - with questions so it was like I would
37:02 - say it was pretty difficult for me at
37:04 - that time but I was learning so much
37:07 - like I think my brain was just like
37:08 - expanding with the amount of things I
37:10 - would learn because like every day I
37:12 - would have to learn you know five five
37:14 - new things and then you multiply that by
37:17 - all the days in the year and like by the
37:19 - end of the first year I learned like so
37:21 - much just from having to do all these
37:24 - like innumerable little tasks yeah
37:28 - it was so yeah I didn't have free time
37:30 - to um try to build my skills because I
37:33 - was learning so much like on the job
37:35 - yeah interesting so like I mean would
37:37 - you just go home and be like exhausted
37:39 - like collapse in your bed like cuz
37:41 - learning is so hard and it's so tax like
37:44 - I spent a lot of my time learning and
37:46 - and not to make it about me again but
37:48 - like like there are days at the end of
37:52 - the day my brain is so tired I it's like
37:54 - mush because I spent the entire day like
37:56 - studying really hard on different topics
37:58 - and stuff like for me like the greatest
38:00 - feeling in the world the thing that I
38:01 - optimize and I build my life around
38:02 - obviously like rearing my kids and stuff
38:04 - like that and you know making a living
38:06 - and and you know running free camp but
38:08 - like in my free time I spend as much
38:10 - time as possible reading listening the
38:12 - podcast studying uh World languages of
38:14 - course shedding on the Bas woodshedding
38:17 - uh Charlie Parker famously goes to a
38:18 - Woodshed and just gets better by just
38:20 - practicing every day in the Woodshed and
38:22 - like like putting on records and
38:23 - learning from anyway sorry like go music
38:26 - tangent I'm obsessed with
38:28 - but
38:29 - um it sounds like your brain was kind of
38:32 - like expanding and you were probably I
38:34 - imagine again I don't want to talk too
38:35 - much about what was theoretically going
38:38 - on in your parid but I imagine like
38:40 - there were more wrinkles getting like
38:42 - you know formed in there and you were
38:44 - like did did you feel yourself becoming
38:46 - more powerful and more uh capable with
38:49 - every day was there a sense of full
38:52 - momentum I I think the first year was
38:55 - more just like living in complete compl
38:57 - abject fear of losing my job um so I
39:01 - think it it took I would say two years I
39:04 - think by the end of my second year at
39:05 - the agency I was like okay I think I'm
39:08 - like starting to feel less panic and
39:10 - more like I realize I'm still at the
39:12 - early stage of the learning curve but it
39:14 - doesn't feel as difficult and impossible
39:18 - as it did in the first year so it's a
39:21 - long time but like I think the 2-year
39:23 - Mark was really where I was starting to
39:25 - feel a little bit more comfortable with
39:28 - and even if I didn't know an answer
39:30 - right away I knew that I had the tools
39:33 - to look up and figure out the solution
39:35 - and I think that when I hit that point I
39:38 - was like okay I like subjectively like
39:41 - or objectively I can do pretty much
39:43 - anything that someone asks me I just
39:46 - need to have enough time to like do the
39:48 - research and do trial and error so it
39:50 - was like up to that point it was very
39:52 - hard but after that point I knew I was
39:54 - still a beginner but I felt more
39:56 - confident in my own ability
39:58 - to research and gain you know the the
40:00 - knowledge I needed to you know do my job
40:04 - so one of the takeways I'm getting is
40:06 - like as much as you were learning a and
40:09 - gaining competency like it was not a fun
40:12 - experience cuz it it sounds like like uh
40:15 - imposter
40:17 - syndrome the clinical diagnosis that
40:19 - every developer gets when they're
40:21 - learning the code unless they learn the
40:22 - code when they're a little kid and they
40:23 - completely forget you know like all the
40:25 - the trial and error and stuff um um it
40:28 - sounds like that was completely casting
40:31 - a shadow over like all the enjoyment
40:34 - like so this was a rough year of your
40:36 - life it sounds like it was rough yeah
40:38 - and I think personally I also don't like
40:41 - feeling incompetent so I think that also
40:43 - made it even more difficult for me to
40:46 - not just be fearful and stressed the
40:49 - entire time so you know maybe other
40:52 - people if you're more comfortable you
40:54 - know not being not knowing everything
40:57 - then maybe it would be a little easier
40:59 - for you but I I think I just put a lot
41:00 - of pressure on myself and I think that
41:02 - definitely contributed to how hard that
41:05 - first year was um yeah I was I was very
41:09 - grumpy yeah I I mean like I guess that
41:13 - was like my one thing like Saving Grace
41:15 - when I was like trying to learn to code
41:17 - over this very lengthy process like
41:19 - looking like a total amateure on stage
41:22 - at these hackathons presenting you know
41:23 - having my code crash and or or just like
41:26 - there was this one time that I went out
41:27 - to a hackathon and like I couldn't
41:30 - actually get the project to work like
41:32 - the whole team was counting on me and we
41:33 - just showed a slideshow instead of
41:35 - showing a working prototype and that was
41:36 - like probably like the lowest point in
41:38 - my coding Journey just having let down
41:40 - my team uh but the one thing that like I
41:43 - think made it a little bit more bearable
41:45 - is I've always been kind of
41:47 - like I've never like thought I was a
41:49 - particularly smart or interesting or
41:52 - capable person I always kind of looked
41:53 - at myself as kind of like
41:55 - a uh just
41:57 - just not like a serious human being um
42:01 - and you know like Socrates like the the
42:03 - only thing I know is that I know nothing
42:06 - and I I always kind of like like you
42:08 - know Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure
42:10 - like the fact that they're like these
42:11 - happy go-lucky kind of fools uh just
42:14 - stumbling into like these very important
42:16 - matters and stuff like that like I
42:17 - always kind of like looked at myself
42:19 - that way and that cushioned kind of the
42:20 - impostor syndrome I'm like of course I'm
42:22 - an imposter like I'm not that smart of a
42:25 - guy you know so uh it sounds like you
42:29 - were holding yourself to a higher
42:30 - standard than I was and that might have
42:31 - been part of the reason for the misery
42:35 - yeah uh you did power through it right
42:39 - you stayed at this job for like seven
42:41 - years right at the at the agency M
42:43 - that's a long time to be at a first job
42:46 - but it's commendable cuz cuz like you
42:48 - know the saying like a rolling stone
42:50 - gathers no Moss you were gathering tons
42:52 - of moss just chilling there right and
42:54 - you want to get moss you want to get
42:56 - character very Moss right you want to be
42:57 - an organic you know uh because Rock by
43:00 - itself is not organic right maybe some
43:03 - types of rock are like sedimentary I
43:04 - don't know but um you know like you were
43:08 - building out like this character and
43:09 - this this Persona as a developer and and
43:11 - kind of coming into your own can you
43:12 - talk about those other six years at the
43:15 - agency once you'd kind of gotten through
43:17 - the first yeah kind of Hell
43:19 - year yeah so I would say so I think I
43:23 - also got
43:25 - promoted um twice
43:27 - in my time there and obviously like
43:30 - companies are completely relative you
43:32 - know everyone sort of has a different
43:34 - idea of like what senior means and all
43:35 - that stuff but I started out as um an
43:39 - assistant web developer so junior level
43:42 - and then I think after two years I got
43:44 - promoted to just web developer so like
43:46 - in the middle and then I think year four
43:49 - I got promoted to senior web developer
43:52 - um again this doesn't mean I could be a
43:54 - senior at like Google or Facebook or
43:56 - whatever but
43:58 - I think that sort of I was it shows that
44:00 - I was able to progress in my career and
44:02 - the agency felt like I was you know
44:05 - contributing more and more the longer
44:07 - that I was there um so yeah it
44:10 - definitely got easier um over time and I
44:13 - felt more confident and less stressed
44:15 - and I sort of like I had a lot of fun
44:17 - back in my agency days cuz you know we
44:19 - all were it's like working together on
44:22 - these incredibly tight timelines and St
44:26 - staying up late sometimes and stuff like
44:27 - that and I don't know if I would want to
44:29 - do that again and have to stay up till
44:32 - 3:00 a.m. deploying something to
44:34 - production because a client needs it
44:35 - live exactly at that moment in time but
44:38 - it was a fun time and I did feel like um
44:42 - because I was more confident in my
44:45 - skills I was Al also able to take on
44:48 - bigger sort of scopes of work so in the
44:51 - last I would say few years of my time at
44:54 - the agency instead of doing these sort
44:56 - of peac meal tasks like updating this
44:58 - button or you know whatever building
45:00 - this like One landing page I would take
45:02 - on sort of full website builds like from
45:05 - scratch so for example one of our
45:07 - clients was a bank and so I built their
45:11 - website both back and front end um so I
45:14 - built the I set up the CMS we used craft
45:17 - CMS which is a a c CMS and then I also
45:21 - did the front end so I did I worked from
45:23 - the design from the designer and I did
45:25 - all the CSS and all that so that was
45:28 - very satisfying to be able to reach that
45:31 - point where I could actually build a
45:33 - project from start to finish like
45:35 - completely on my own so I I enjoyed that
45:37 - work a
45:38 - lot yeah that's that's sounds like quite
45:42 - an evolution so very beginning you don't
45:45 - know how to do anything you're like
45:46 - struggling to like referencing your
45:48 - notebook over and over that your boss is
45:50 - giving you you're scared to ask
45:52 - questions probably because he's created
45:53 - a Culture of Fear around asking
45:56 - questions
45:57 - but uh yep but by the end you're you're
46:00 - you're like this kind of superhero
46:02 - that's just like sure I can do I can
46:04 - learn you know CP craft new CMS I never
46:07 - heard of uh CMS uh I can do the front
46:10 - end and I I'm like Soup To Nuts uh full
46:14 - stack Dev basically that's that's got to
46:17 - be still have a notebook I do have to
46:18 - say I I still I didn't have a physical
46:21 - notebook as much but it was more like I
46:23 - would keep track of notes like online
46:26 - that's actually how the blogging thing
46:28 - started cuzz I started a blog spot just
46:30 - to write down the notes so I could
46:34 - quickly um refer back to them based on
46:36 - the the tags and stuff so that's kind of
46:39 - how I started the developer blog thing
46:43 - notes for myself man that that is a
46:44 - blast from the past so uh I know right
46:47 - there was this Blogspot and blogger were
46:50 - they were the same right they were the
46:52 - same yeah the domain was blog spot but
46:54 - it was called blogger great
46:57 - branding yeah it's very not confuse
47:00 - anybody right so if you read this book
47:03 - uh it's called the founders at work
47:05 - great classic book that every startup
47:06 - founder has to written by Jessica
47:09 - Livingston uh YC you know board member
47:12 - why combinator board member there's this
47:14 - amazing interview with EV Williams uh
47:17 - where he was running blogger and he had
47:19 - to fire everybody they ran out of money
47:20 - at one point because he was such a bad
47:22 - you know developer like CEO I I no shade
47:26 - to him but he's not the greatest CEO on
47:28 - earth right as we've seen time and time
47:30 - again right so uh then he went on to
47:32 - found Twitter and medium and all these
47:33 - other uh websites but um yeah man like
47:37 - that is a harrowing tale that's by far
47:39 - the best interview in the book is the
47:41 - the tale of kind of ineptitude that led
47:44 - the vlogger almost being destroyed until
47:46 - Google swooped it and saved it the 11th
47:48 - hour but uh that's a that's a cool
47:51 - website so you started blogging on there
47:53 - just as a way to track your own learning
47:55 - like I just take and email them to
47:57 - myself and then I search them in Google
47:59 - right like they're personal but you were
48:01 - actually publicly you were learning in
48:02 - public as Sha Wang likes to say like you
48:04 - were learning in public before it was
48:06 - the thing to do uh you were kind of like
48:08 - one of the early adopters of just yeting
48:12 - your learnings out into the stratosphere
48:15 - yeah I mean I wasn't trying to build an
48:17 - audience or whatever this is kind of
48:19 - before everyone was trying to do that it
48:20 - was really just I wasn't expecting
48:22 - anyone to find my blog and I don't think
48:24 - anyone public ever really discovered it
48:27 - cuz like it was just these random notes
48:30 - on like SQL and c and CSS and stuff yeah
48:33 - but it got the uh kind of like technical
48:35 - writing creative Creator engine going
48:39 - right like the the Jessica Chan the
48:41 - coder coder that we know today is
48:43 - ultimately a consequence of you sharing
48:46 - your learning online right yeah for sure
48:50 - and I think yeah looking back I think
48:53 - that notes blog did help me sort of
48:56 - eventually choose the Cod or coder
49:00 - Direction yeah so you're working at this
49:02 - agency you've been there for six years
49:05 - um at what point did you start like
49:07 - seriously taking or taking seriously the
49:09 - notion that like hey I could create
49:10 - tutorials on YouTube or I could write
49:13 - blog posts that actually help people
49:15 - like actually having an audience in mind
49:17 - rather than just yourself as your future
49:19 - self as the
49:21 - audience yeah um so I would have to say
49:24 - this whole time as I'd mentioned like I
49:27 - just enjoyed setting up blogs just for
49:29 - fun I also had this kind of like maybe
49:32 - entrepreneurial interest even from when
49:35 - I was a young kid like I remember when I
49:38 - was young I made this like vending
49:39 - machine out of a shoe box and I tried to
49:41 - sell it to my siblings and like I would
49:43 - just put like random candy and like
49:45 - peanuts in it and trying to make money
49:47 - off of them so I feel like I always was
49:50 - interested in not necessarily like
49:53 - making a lot of money and getting rich
49:55 - but again kind of creating this entity
49:58 - that worked in terms of operating as a
50:01 - business and letting me be autonomous
50:04 - which is a huge sort of core desire of
50:07 - my of mine like I really like the idea
50:10 - of kind of being independent and
50:12 - not having to be dependent on say a
50:15 - company or whatever um for my livelihood
50:18 - so I
50:19 - think you
50:21 - know when when you're working at a
50:23 - company I think there's good and there's
50:25 - bad and I think I saw both of those um
50:27 - in my time at the agency we had I think
50:29 - maybe one or two layoffs and those are
50:33 - incredibly demoralizing for the people
50:35 - who are laid off obviously but also the
50:37 - people who are left and it kind of
50:39 - really hits home that the company's not
50:41 - there to like help you like the
50:43 - company's there to exist as its own and
50:45 - you are it's kind of being built on the
50:47 - backs of the people working there every
50:50 - day so I think maybe with a little bit
50:53 - of um disillusionment I would say with
50:57 - the you know the whole like getting a
50:59 - corporate job and they'll take care of
51:00 - you and give you benefits y y which was
51:02 - very good um but I think and that may
51:05 - have been how it was back in the day
51:08 - when there was like zero competition
51:10 - like nobody went to college and uh you
51:12 - know if you served in the war that was
51:14 - probably good enough for you to be up to
51:16 - be like an executive and an advertising
51:18 - agency if you seen Mad Men like they
51:20 - always make fun of the college kids cuz
51:21 - they went to war when the college kids
51:23 - just went and like lived these yepy
51:25 - Lifestyles and stuff uh but but like
51:27 - things used to be a lot less competitive
51:28 - people would just drink martinis all day
51:30 - and like it was uh you know I mean like
51:33 - things have gotten so incredibly
51:35 - intensely competitive over the last 30
51:38 - or 40 years and I I don't think cut old
51:40 - folks understand frankly there's like a
51:42 - like a lack of empathy from like you
51:44 - know a lot of older folks I don't want
51:46 - to say all older folks there are
51:47 - definitely you know people from previous
51:50 - you know like people in their 70s and '
51:52 - 80s that do understand how hard young
51:54 - people have it but it has gotten so
51:55 - intensely competitive that uh any kind
51:59 - of like social contract between an
52:02 - employer and an employee that may used
52:04 - to exist when you were like a you know
52:06 - an IBM man or something like that right
52:09 - that is long gone right like there's
52:12 - nobody that can't be fired basically
52:14 - unless you're Mark Zuckerberg and you
52:15 - have like Ironclad control of like the
52:18 - the preferred chairs and you nobody can
52:20 - fire you like he can't get fired right
52:23 - Travis K in theory couldn't have been
52:25 - fired from Uber he he also had like
52:28 - super majority like shares and stuff he
52:31 - ultimately stepped down because there
52:32 - was just so much pressure on him if you
52:33 - watch super pumped on Netflix great show
52:36 - about entrepreneurialism not uh not safe
52:38 - for kids um to check it out it's great
52:42 - show I I've talked about it before and I
52:44 - I do recommend super pumped uh with
52:46 - perhaps one of my favorite actors uh
52:49 - today uh Joseph Gordon Levitz he does a
52:51 - great job representing Travis K the the
52:54 - most mocky valant business figure of our
52:56 - time
52:57 - but what I'm just trying to get to is
52:59 - like like anybody who says like we're a
53:02 - family you know blah like you know like
53:05 - run the other way if your employer
53:07 - doesn't accept that there is you know
53:09 - like you're a mercenary essentially uh
53:12 - and you can really like working at the
53:13 - job but at the same time just know that
53:16 - um you know companies ultimately have to
53:18 - respond to incentives from you know
53:20 - investors and other people like that and
53:22 - like you're just one of many people they
53:24 - don't like laying people off I don't
53:25 - think anybody enjoys let letting people
53:27 - go but as you saw twice just on the
53:30 - front lines your your colleagues getting
53:33 - let go like that that happens and um
53:37 - yeah that was that one of the reasons
53:39 - why you like ultimately wanted to get
53:41 - out of the proverbial Rat Race and like
53:44 - become independent I think eventually
53:46 - but I think
53:48 - I I also had sort of discovered the
53:50 - whole like idea of blogging as like a
53:53 - income Source um I think you know this
53:57 - is back in the I would say maybe 2010s
53:59 - or so this is when blogging was like
54:01 - really I would say at its peak with like
54:03 - you could you could make money off of
54:04 - like affiliate links and all this kind
54:05 - of stuff and so I think I since I loved
54:09 - blogging I was like oh this could be
54:12 - something that I could do and I think I
54:14 - was kind of searching for a way that I
54:16 - could make money on my own without
54:18 - having to be dependent on a company and
54:21 - I'd read this book called um the $100
54:24 - startup by Chris Gilbo
54:27 - um and I remember this is this is how
54:28 - coder coder started so like I was on a
54:30 - flight to Japan to visit my friend and I
54:32 - was reading this startup book on the
54:35 - plane and Chris Gilbo asks you like okay
54:39 - to figure out what business idea you can
54:41 - come up with like what are you
54:43 - passionate about and what can you know
54:46 - you what can you do to help other people
54:50 - and so for me I was like oh I would say
54:52 - I'm passionate about coding I really
54:53 - enjoy building websites and I think it's
54:55 - a skill that I could you know share with
54:58 - other people and help them to basically
55:00 - do what I did because you know coding
55:03 - took me from working these temporary
55:05 - office gigs to having like a very stable
55:09 - like well-paying career and so I felt
55:11 - like that moment of realization of like
55:14 - oh I should do this like I want to do
55:17 - this and so that's kind of how I started
55:19 - like getting more serious about writing
55:22 - coding tutorials on my blog and then I
55:24 - also got into Instagram I found out
55:25 - there was like a whole develop our
55:26 - community on Instagram which was like
55:28 - really cool because um in my job like my
55:31 - co-workers were great but like I only
55:35 - had worked with like male co-workers
55:37 - like there were no other women um like
55:40 - at my job the entire time that I worked
55:42 - there so seeing on Instagram that there
55:44 - were like you
55:46 - know other people doing web development
55:49 - who you know looked more like me was
55:51 - like a really cool sense of community
55:53 - and so I kind of like fell into like
55:56 - those sort of areas in terms of like
55:58 - online you know webd type of stuff um so
56:03 - yeah that's how coder coder
56:06 - started yeah um yeah yeah that that's
56:10 - really cool so I mean you brought up an
56:13 - important point about the fact that like
56:14 - the field was very male-dominated um at
56:16 - the time and uh so just just to finish
56:21 - kind of like the the origin story um and
56:24 - establish our chronology we're going to
56:26 - be drawing from for the rest of the
56:27 - conversation so you you did leave this
56:30 - job at the um at the agency and was that
56:33 - to ultimately go into freelancing
56:36 - yourself um yeah so I left the
56:38 - agency because I was trying
56:41 - to do freelance and sort of build up
56:44 - like the coder coder thing so I did end
56:47 - up freelancing for the agency for a
56:49 - little bit after even after I left um
56:51 - but I think it was just nice
56:53 - to yeah have less of the sort of
56:56 - expectations and everything um but yeah
56:59 - so I did freelance for I would say a
57:02 - long time maybe like three or four years
57:06 - um and then I I did freelancing for like
57:08 - other like another company as well
57:11 - before I quit that a couple years ago so
57:14 - you were able to kind of like taper off
57:16 - having people go out and find clients
57:17 - for you essentially that's what like an
57:19 - agency does it it kind of like puts
57:21 - Under One Roof like both the sales side
57:23 - and the actual like I guess production
57:25 - side
57:27 - uh that's probably an oversimplification
57:28 - I've never worked at an agency uh I have
57:30 - people that swear by working at agencies
57:32 - that love agency life like Cass Marino
57:34 - CSS artist whom you can watch an
57:36 - interview with here on the fre C Camp uh
57:39 - YouTube channel or on the uh that listen
57:40 - you can listen on the free C Camp
57:42 - podcast she's amazing uh but
57:45 - uh I'm really interested in kind of like
57:48 - how you tapered that off and how you
57:49 - went out and got your own clients
57:51 - because that is something that a lot of
57:52 - people listening to this would like to
57:54 - ultimately freelance and have their own
57:57 - kind of
57:59 - consultancy yeah
58:01 - um I mean to be honest I
58:04 - never was like having to find my own
58:06 - clients because my clients were
58:08 - companies if that makes sense so like my
58:10 - first client was obviously my old agency
58:12 - and then um just through knowing
58:15 - co-workers who moved on to other
58:16 - companies like they were hiring
58:18 - Freelancers as well so I was doing
58:21 - freelance jobs for like their new
58:23 - companies and stuff like that um so I
58:25 - never did the the whole like you know
58:26 - local like try to find you know local
58:29 - businesses to to build up your clientele
58:32 - but I do know that's very possible
58:34 - that's such an interesting departure
58:36 - from what a lot of the other people who
58:37 - do fre so essentially you built like
58:40 - this network from working in an agency
58:42 - for so long uh that you already had like
58:45 - kind of all the connective tissue you
58:47 - needed to be able to just continue to
58:49 - Coast on those
58:52 - relationships yeah yeah for sure I think
58:55 - I had a very very yeah I'm very
58:57 - fortunate that I benefited from my my
58:59 - networking um back then and yeah just
59:02 - able to find different freelance gigs um
59:07 - yeah yeah and the entire time you're
59:10 - blogging and as you said in the early
59:12 - 2010s blogging was at its Heyday you
59:14 - could slap AdSense on a blog or
59:16 - potentially get like sponsorships or do
59:18 - other things like that and you could
59:20 - actually make real money blogging now
59:22 - can you make real money blogging well I
59:24 - am going to tell you how much money free
59:26 - Cod camps publication Mi right we do uh
59:30 - millions of page views a month uh on
59:33 - that and we just have like Google
59:34 - AdSense running and I think we make like
59:36 - maybe like 10 or 15K a month from like
59:39 - the ads the show on there it's not a lot
59:41 - of money when you consider like the
59:42 - entire staff millions of and yeah like
59:45 - like we have an editorial team uh we we
59:48 - have a a ton of volunteer contributors
59:51 - who write their excellent tutorials and
59:53 - publish up there I published my entire
59:55 - book if you Google learn the code book
59:57 - it's free it's all on freecodecamp.org
60:00 - newsnews that's our publication um and
60:03 - we published tons of tutorials there
60:04 - every week we probably publish like 20
60:06 - tutorials a week and including a lot of
60:08 - full length books and handbooks we've
60:09 - got more than 100 books through freeo
60:11 - Camp press which is really just us
60:12 - publishing through our CMS but uh yeah
60:15 - like there's no way that I was like an
60:18 - individual author trying to live off
60:20 - AdSense that I'd be able to right we've
60:21 - got like all this momentum from SEO and
60:24 - like just being around and like having
60:26 - reputation and all everything we do free
60:28 - Cod Camp kind of like feeds into like
60:30 - people knowing that free Cod Camp exists
60:31 - I wear the free Cod camp shirt literally
60:33 - everywhere I go you know it's like FR
60:35 - I've got like 10 of these and I just
60:36 - wear them every day um it's my uniform I
60:38 - got to be a billboard for for this
60:40 - charity right uh so so you know 15K I
60:45 - don't imagine you were making even close
60:46 - to 15K off just ad ad Revenue but like
60:49 - maybe you could talk about how you were
60:51 - able to gradually become more of a
60:55 - content creator and less of a uh
60:58 - freelancer yeah so I think it grew I
61:01 - would say pretty slowly so like
61:03 - initially I had the blog and I don't
61:05 - know if I even put ads on the blog
61:07 - initially I think the only way I was
61:09 - making money was Amazon affiliate links
61:13 - um and it was doing like it was doing
61:16 - okay but it wasn't
61:18 - like I mean when you say okay if you
61:20 - wouldn't mind giving like could you
61:22 - could you tell us um if I can remember I
61:25 - would would
61:26 - [Music]
61:28 - say maybe
61:30 - like I would say
61:32 - $200 a month would be pretty good oh wow
61:36 - okay so so that's from Amazon affiliate
61:38 - links like yeah and now if you try to do
61:40 - Amazon affiliate links I think I've
61:42 - heard it's a lot less like they really
61:44 - don't care about the affiliate Market
61:45 - yeah yeah so I think that the the the
61:48 - landscape in terms of online like
61:50 - moneymaking has definitely changed you
61:52 - cannot you cannot live off of
61:54 - ads and affiliate links alone you you
61:57 - need other you need other Diversified
62:00 - channels of income for
62:03 - sure yeah yeah so um what were your what
62:07 - was your like I guess Revenue stack if
62:09 - you will like how were you able to like
62:13 - uh to make it
62:15 - work yeah so I think things changed a
62:17 - lot when I decided to go into YouTube um
62:20 - and not just writing text tutorials but
62:22 - like you know doing these screencasts
62:23 - and other things and so that started
62:26 - probably it was had like like stops and
62:29 - starts so I think the first YouTube
62:31 - video was uploaded in like 2017 and then
62:34 - I didn't upload another video for like a
62:35 - year or two years um but I did
62:39 - eventually start being more consistent
62:41 - about uploading videos and things
62:45 - started taking off in
62:47 - 2020 like I think when the pandemic hit
62:49 - everyone was just like online 24/7 so
62:53 - like back then there were a lot of
62:55 - people watching YouTube videos so that
62:57 - was kind of when my channel started
62:58 - growing a lot and I was able to make
63:02 - money off of
63:03 - AdSense I think maybe since then maybe
63:07 - the max that I would do was like 1,500 a
63:11 - month from just AdSense which was pretty
63:13 - good um and then I also had some
63:16 - affiliate links and that was bringing in
63:17 - about the same per month um but okay so
63:20 - so you're making about $33,000 a month
63:23 - just as a Creator and you're still doing
63:25 - Consulting work at this point or were
63:28 - you I was doing freelancing um and then
63:31 - at some point I was like I think when I
63:33 - hit that three 3K a month Mark I was
63:35 - like all right let's like just try to do
63:38 - coder coder and not do freelance anymore
63:41 - so I stopped doing freelance I would say
63:43 - maybe 20 22 just like just like a couple
63:46 - years
63:47 - ago yeah and to put this in context like
63:50 - for a lot of people listening to this
63:52 - they may be single or uh not like Mar or
63:56 - you know maybe in a situation where they
63:58 - they are not able to get health
63:59 - insurance your your husband uh is an
64:03 - accomplished animator uh if you wouldn't
64:05 - talk if you wouldn't mind talking a
64:06 - little bit about him and like the role
64:08 - he played in you being able to make this
64:09 - transition cuz my wife was absolutely
64:11 - instrumental and me being able to make
64:13 - the trans transition she was working you
64:15 - know in Tech doing accounting and we had
64:17 - health insurance she wasn't making just
64:19 - a ton of money cuz she was she wasn't a
64:21 - developer she was like doing accounting
64:22 - and stuff and which is like half a
64:25 - quarter of 10th of what developers make
64:27 - but uh but that insurance was very
64:29 - helpful and also the fact that we just
64:31 - had like a consistent Baseline like the
64:34 - rent was basically covered just from her
64:36 - income and stuff uh so that gave me the
64:38 - flexibility to take more risks if I were
64:40 - a single person uh and I didn't have
64:43 - like and I also had like a lot of
64:44 - savings and I've famously plowed like
64:47 - $150,000 of my own Savings in a free Cod
64:49 - camp and that was money that like I
64:50 - earned over like 10 years working as a
64:52 - teacher basically like you can imagine
64:54 - what a teacher I basically saved half of
64:57 - everything I I earned and I also like
64:59 - hustled back in the day like you hear
65:01 - about this all the time and I'm not sure
65:02 - if you can even make money on it anymore
65:03 - but I I would like buy tons of old like
65:06 - video games and stuff that like
65:07 - Collectibles things like that on
65:09 - Craigslist go to like you know buy Big
65:12 - Lots of these things and then I break
65:14 - them down and sell them kind of piece
65:15 - them out on eBay and sell them that way
65:17 - and that so that's how I like the the
65:20 - small fortune you know $150,000 that I
65:23 - used to fund develop like the first few
65:25 - years of free Camp before we got our tax
65:27 - income status
65:29 - but the entire time of course we also
65:31 - had my wife's income so it just uh so so
65:34 - I always like to point out like your
65:36 - situation your circumstances are going
65:38 - to be different from mine and Jessica so
65:40 - just factor that in your mileage May VAR
65:43 - and also factor that in when you hear
65:44 - these getrich quick schemer type people
65:47 - or like these like oh like the you know
65:49 - the hustle culture Bros and people like
65:51 - that right like you know there is risk
65:55 - in trying to become a Creator there is
65:57 - risk in trying to become a freelancer
65:58 - there's risk in taking time off to like
66:00 - learn to code in hopes of getting a
66:02 - developer job and uh I think people are
66:04 - remiss when they don't acknowledge that
66:07 - risk but anyway sorry with that sidebar
66:10 - your husband um yeah so my husband
66:13 - actually is also a freelancer so
66:15 - unfortunately we are paying um out of
66:19 - pocket for Private health insurance and
66:21 - it's like very expensive um I think I
66:24 - remember I had a friend who was talking
66:25 - to who lives in Canada and I was talking
66:28 - about how we have to pay for our own
66:29 - health insurance he's like oh like how
66:31 - much is it I was like you know it's like
66:33 - $1,000 a month for like two people and
66:35 - she was like what because like she was
66:37 - and she was like I'm complaining about
66:39 - spending $50 a month on my Canadian
66:41 - health insurance so like that was just
66:43 - like a huge like I think eye opening
66:46 - moment for yeah yeah so it's it's very
66:50 - expensive in America to pay for
66:52 - insurance yourself um but we I think we
66:56 - make it work because we do have savings
67:00 - and we also live in kind of a
67:02 - lower um cost of what's it called cost
67:06 - of living lower cost of living part of
67:08 - the country so that helps too um cuz you
67:13 - know if you want to live in like LA or
67:15 - New York or you know wherever it's like
67:18 - I think there's definitely obviously
67:20 - benefits to that and there's a reason
67:21 - why so many people want to live there
67:23 - but you know I remember reading about um
67:25 - Chris coyer from CSS tricks and finding
67:27 - out that he lives like up in Wisconsin
67:29 - or something and I think that was for me
67:32 - at least the realization of like oh you
67:33 - can like still have a really big online
67:36 - presence and be a part of you know the
67:39 - whole Community but you don't have to
67:41 - live in like these bigname cities so
67:43 - yeah I think that yeah a lot of those
67:46 - those Heavies as I like to call them in
67:48 - the teaching space you know Chris Kyer
67:50 - of course uh great dude whom we hope to
67:53 - have uh on the podcast at some point uh
67:56 - yes West boss Scott stalinsky uh like a
67:59 - lot of the kind of like the I guess the
68:02 - people that preceded me uh like like
68:05 - whom I looked up to and learned from
68:07 - very early on and probably you and like
68:09 - a lot of other people also look up to
68:11 - and learned from them they live out in
68:12 - the middle of
68:14 - nowhere and and
68:16 - like yeah and so you don't have to live
68:20 - in SF it absolutely helps and I did live
68:22 - in SF during the early first few years
68:25 - um free cooking SF San Francisco I moved
68:27 - out there because that's the tech Mecca
68:29 - and for me it wasn't that big a deal
68:30 - because I was already living in like
68:32 - Southern California so I just went up
68:34 - there and slept on my friend's couch uh
68:36 - for a few months and then I eventually
68:38 - was able my wife was able to transfer
68:39 - within her company up there and we were
68:41 - able to make it work inff but we we're
68:43 - living in a a one bedroom shoe box it's
68:46 - like 600 square F feet and we were
68:47 - paying like a ton of money to live there
68:50 - and so you know it's definitely for me
68:52 - it was a phase it was like a stage if
68:54 - you look at like a rocket you know how
68:56 - there's like the booster stage that was
68:57 - the booster stage and now like we're a
68:59 - little higher up you know we don't need
69:01 - as much fuel to like keep keep ascending
69:04 - or something like that I don't know it's
69:05 - a weird analogy but it sounds like you
69:07 - and your husband and and by the way I
69:10 - also get like Obamacare like I pay from
69:12 - the private Market as well and like most
69:14 - people I know do unless they're at like
69:16 - some big company that has like fancy
69:18 - health insurance and if you're getting
69:20 - health insurance you're paying for it
69:21 - some way right like you're probably
69:22 - getting a lower you know uh compensation
69:26 - in some other form because that
69:28 - benefit employees are sophisticated they
69:30 - look at you as the total cost of having
69:32 - this person fill this cubicle seat right
69:35 - um they're they're not unsophisticated
69:37 - and they're not Charities right like
69:39 - free COC is literally a charity but its
69:42 - purpose is not to be charitable to the
69:44 - people that work at free c yeah it's to
69:46 - be to serve a charitable purpose which
69:48 - our our mission our charitable tax exam
69:50 - purpose from the IRS to create free
69:52 - learning resources like this podcast
69:54 - you're watching right now
69:56 - and uh I'll just while I'm ranting about
69:58 - freeo I'll just say you can become one
70:00 - of the 9 million plus 9 million sorry I
70:03 - wish it was 9 million 9,000 plus I think
70:05 - it's like 9,000 and3 we just crossed
70:07 - 9,000 uh recently people who support
70:10 - free C Camp each month with a small
70:13 - donation of like $5 a month or something
70:14 - like that you go to freec camp.org
70:16 - donate you make all this possible the
70:18 - the courses the Interactive Learning
70:20 - platform the text based tutorials the
70:22 - books uh everything so um shout out to
70:25 - all those those kind folks and if you're
70:26 - watching uh thank you um or if you're
70:30 - listening I always listen to the audio
70:31 - version I don't actually watch the video
70:33 - version but like we have a lot of people
70:35 - that watch the video so they get to look
70:37 - at like the cool video I put on in the
70:39 - background so that people don't just
70:40 - have to look at my face for two hours
70:42 - they can look at like a trct mode of
70:43 - some old Japanese arcade game from the
70:45 - 80s okay
70:47 - so back to uh like just day-to-day
70:51 - living as a freelancer so your husband
70:53 - is no stranger at a freelancer
70:55 - life he is doing
70:57 - animation his animation is amazing I
71:00 - don't know if he also does the sound
71:01 - design but like just like the the candy
71:04 - anything yeah yeah and and like so again
71:07 - I'm going to link to uh that one video
71:09 - about your coding Journey uh which what
71:11 - we just talked about at length over the
71:12 - last hour you can like learn all that in
71:14 - six minutes with really cool Pokemon
71:17 - kind of Earthbound looking uh animations
71:20 - and stuff um by the way I was like
71:23 - watching that video I was like uh I
71:25 - hadn't seen it in like four years since
71:27 - you first published it and last night I
71:28 - watched it um and I also I showed it to
71:30 - my kids um back in the day but like I I
71:33 - left this really lengthy comment on on
71:35 - YouTube like anybody who leaves comments
71:37 - on YouTube if you ever feel like man
71:39 - YouTube just like did anybody even see
71:41 - my comment I don't think anybody saw
71:42 - this comment you saw it you like put
71:44 - like the heart thing which you can do if
71:45 - you're the creator of the video but like
71:48 - it had one thumbs up and that was
71:50 - probably you I like spent probably like
71:53 - 5 minutes like you know coming with this
71:55 - really
71:56 - compliment I think Brad traversy who
71:59 - runs uh you know uh traversy media he's
72:01 - jumped in he's like great video and it
72:03 - had like 2,000 upvotes and like so I I
72:07 - genuinely believe that YouTube is like
72:09 - heavily biased on toward people who
72:10 - leave comments within the first few
72:12 - minutes those are the ones that people
72:13 - are going to like and it those are the
72:14 - comments that are going to rise to the
72:16 - top so if anybody ever leaves a video
72:18 - and you feel neglected or if you ever
72:20 - leave a comment on a video and you feel
72:21 - neglected know that I'm right there with
72:23 - you and that I feel robbed by YouTube's
72:25 - comment algorithm I spent so much time
72:27 - coming up like 5 minutes of My Life
72:29 - coming up with that comment and nobody
72:31 - saw it yeah anyway definitely heavily
72:34 - weighted toward the early early stuff
72:37 - yeah so uh so you've got approximately
72:41 - uh $3,000 a month uh in income uh and
72:44 - you're paying a th000 of that just to uh
72:47 - private insurance and stuff like that
72:48 - but like where do you go from there and
72:50 - how do you build out this coder coder
72:52 - brand uh and this kind of like High
72:55 - touch polished like fancy animation like
72:58 - really high energy uh I mean it's almost
73:02 - like you're definitely the highest
73:04 - production Creator in the uh tutorial
73:08 - space in my humble opinion oh unless
73:10 - missing like I don't know anybody that
73:12 - like puts as much thought and
73:14 - deliberation into every minute of a
73:15 - video as you
73:17 - do yeah I mean there's there's
73:20 - definitely a lot of really great
73:21 - creators in the space like fire ship and
73:24 - um there's like some new channel that
73:25 - are pretty pretty good like hyperplex a
73:28 - lot of Animation Stu but yeah thank you
73:30 - you're you're very kind I will pass on
73:32 - the the compliments to my husband
73:36 - um yeah so sorry the question is like
73:39 - how do I yeah like how do things unfold
73:42 - from there like like what what are some
73:44 - of the main things you've learned
73:45 - creating these video
73:47 - tutorials I would actually say that yes
73:50 - I acknowledge I have a very unfair
73:52 - advantage in terms of being married to
73:55 - an incredibly talented animator and
73:57 - editor um but I would actually say that
74:01 - you can't rely you can't just Coast on
74:03 - like the sizzle you do need to have like
74:06 - content so I think I would actually say
74:08 - that one of
74:10 - the main maybe benefits of my videos
74:13 - that I really try to go in depth in the
74:16 - tutorials so like I spend a lot of time
74:18 - when I'm writing scripts for the videos
74:20 - one writing a script because I'm
74:22 - terrible ad living I've gotten better
74:24 - over time
74:25 - but um I like writing everything out and
74:28 - I do a lot of research on like I read
74:30 - like the um Mozilla developer Network a
74:33 - lot I also read the actual like um what
74:35 - is it the the HTML spec from the the W3
74:39 - and that is like bedtime reading it's
74:42 - like incredibly dense and hard to pick
74:46 - out the meaning but you know I do it
74:49 - when I have to so I would say that like
74:51 - I try really hard to do a lot of depth
74:55 - research but also present that in-depth
74:57 - information in a way that is accessible
74:59 - to people who are not you know experts
75:02 - in the field because I think that's
75:04 - really important to be able to talk to
75:07 - people at the level that they're at and
75:09 - sort of guide them through their own
75:11 - Learning Journey so that's I would say
75:14 - that's the most important thing that I
75:16 - try to do in all my videos so research
75:19 - and preparation so by the time you like
75:22 - turn on the camera or turn on the mics
75:24 - you've already spent a great deal of
75:25 - time thinking about the topic that
75:26 - you're going to talk about and uh yeah
75:29 - and and it shows it comes through in
75:31 - your videos that you're like pretty
75:32 - authoritative and and you're pretty
75:34 - definitive um and and also it's just
75:38 - like really compressed like you said
75:39 - Fire Ship is famous for having like
75:40 - these three minute videos that are funny
75:42 - and just like overload of memes and
75:44 - stuff like that um and like like C in
75:48 - three minutes or something like that
75:49 - right like those kinds of videos those
75:50 - are cool those those are fun uh and then
75:53 - you have like the polar opposite where
75:55 - these long winding conversations between
75:58 - two people who have done stuff you know
76:00 - over here on the freeo camp podcast
76:02 - right so um zero production value just
76:06 - just Personality yeah so good content
76:10 - yeah exactly and like again I listen to
76:13 - so many pocket people like I I
76:15 - interviewed
76:16 - Scott uh sininsky not Scott Selinsky uh
76:19 - Scott the other Pro Scott Hanselman yes
76:23 - he like how do you do it like who listen
76:24 - list to this stuff like who has time to
76:26 - listen to but I listen to this stuff all
76:28 - the time I learned so much for like long
76:31 - interviews um and I feel like they they
76:33 - surface a whole lot of you know
76:35 - interesting stuff that wouldn't come out
76:36 - in like a polished like if you were to
76:38 - go on Good Morning America which uh you
76:40 - know is like like you're lucky if they
76:42 - take like three sentences of what you
76:44 - say and put it on there right so for
76:47 - sure I I have so many questions for you
76:50 - we haven't even gotten to them and I'm
76:51 - just going to start firing them off sure
76:53 - right uh so you worked seven years at
76:56 - your first job would you recommend
76:58 - people stay at their first job for seven
77:01 - years I think if it works for you I
77:04 - think if I stayed as long as I did
77:06 - because I felt like I was constantly
77:07 - learning and like I didn't plateau and I
77:09 - felt like it was a
77:11 - reasonably not toxic environment for the
77:14 - most part and so I think it really
77:16 - depends on the situation but I do think
77:18 - that it can be a benefit to start at one
77:20 - company and kind of you know work your
77:22 - way up and get experience there um
77:25 - yeah varies you yeah absolutely you have
77:29 - a really cool like background like area
77:31 - it looks like you got a nice bookshelf
77:32 - you may actually have the same it's not
77:34 - the same bookshelf it's a similar
77:35 - bookshelf I got it on like
77:38 - Wayfair but but like you've got like a
77:41 - cool kind of like setup over there and
77:43 - like I imagine you know you're into like
77:45 - mechanical keyboards and stuff like that
77:47 - uh like just like the Aesthetics of
77:49 - getting work done mhm especially as like
77:52 - an more artist artistic minded person
77:54 - who who is like studyed photography and
77:56 - probably like you know you know Mary
77:58 - condo cell like looks thinks about like
78:00 - all the different little details and
78:01 - stuff right I
78:03 - try so maybe you could talk about your
78:07 - setup and like how you get in your happy
78:09 - place for getting work done oh yeah
78:11 - that's a big question um I'm going to be
78:15 - completely honest here so I've worked
78:18 - remotely for the past seven years um
78:22 - some of it was at the agency where I
78:23 - actually worked remotely and started out
78:25 - working in the physical office but
78:27 - motivation has been a
78:30 - huge like I cannot overestimate how much
78:33 - of a struggle staying motivated has been
78:36 - um working remotely and then also just
78:38 - like working for myself essentially um
78:42 - I'm still like figuring it out but like
78:47 - I I'm very embarrassed
78:50 - about like the thought of what I do with
78:53 - my day um like you've seen those videos
78:56 - where it's like you know day in the life
78:57 - of a programmer and like you see all the
78:59 - things that they do it's like everyone's
79:00 - like waking up at 6:00 a. and stuff it's
79:02 - like I do not wake up at 6:00 a.m. my
79:05 - sleep schedules can very swing
79:09 - widely um and I'm definitely not like
79:13 - sit down the desk for eight hours and
79:15 - like type away so it's like it's been a
79:18 - pretty big struggle if I'm honest and I
79:20 - think you know the whole pandemic was
79:21 - part of that too I think um yeah yeah
79:24 - just made things hard but I'm hopefully
79:29 - getting better at motivating myself but
79:33 - it's yeah it's hard man especially when
79:35 - you're just at home all the time yeah
79:37 - when you have to turn it on when you're
79:39 - like man I got this deadline like or I
79:42 - committed to this goal of mine maybe
79:44 - nobody else uh knows about it but you
79:47 - like want to hold yourself accountable
79:48 - like how do you fire yourself up to to
79:51 - get things done do you have any sort of
79:52 - ritual or some sort of like fallback
79:55 - some sort of song that you put on that
79:56 - like you know the rocky
79:59 - them like something that you do to like
80:02 - to to get on point for me
80:07 - um yeah I'm still figuring that part out
80:11 - but I will say there's this guy on
80:13 - YouTube called struthless he's a tattoo
80:15 - artist but he makes really cool videos
80:18 - on a lot of them are like productivity
80:19 - and motivation and stuff like that and
80:21 - just like artistic stuff and he had this
80:23 - whole video on motivation and he named
80:26 - something called the dark why so it's
80:30 - this idea that when we think about
80:32 - motivation we want to think like oh like
80:34 - I'm you know it's like all good it's all
80:37 - like positive stuff but in reality
80:39 - people are really motivated by either
80:41 - getting away from or proving something
80:43 - wrong or like avoiding these like bad
80:45 - things that we don't want to happen and
80:48 - I think that that is true for me for
80:50 - sure so for example I've been working on
80:53 - this course for like I don't know how
80:54 - how many years now it's been again a big
80:56 - struggle but I think um when I had a
81:02 - early access launch back in November um
81:04 - last year that was my like drop dead
81:07 - deadline where it's like this has to be
81:09 - done before that point otherwise I've
81:12 - already said it publicly what the launch
81:13 - date is I'm going to like hugely
81:15 - embarrass myself and also disappoint
81:17 - myself if I don't make that deadline so
81:20 - once I had that external deadline that
81:22 - really like lit a fire under my butt and
81:27 - got me to just like the finish line so I
81:30 - think I think a lot of it is just
81:32 - figuring out how you operate and what
81:34 - things actually can motivate you um but
81:39 - yeah also not to sound cliche but I
81:41 - think not letting myself scroll on
81:43 - Reddit all the time helped a lot so just
81:46 - kind of like limiting that social media
81:48 - phone time I think helps helps your
81:52 - brain yeah 100% I will second that uh I
81:56 - um I don't spend any time on Reddit uh
81:59 - in fact Reddit timed me out as a mod for
82:01 - my own subreddit oh no R free Coke camp
82:03 - like I in like inactive status it's this
82:06 - badge and I'm the I'm the mod like I
82:08 - created the free C Camp subred right and
82:11 - they won't let me like add Naomi from
82:13 - our team as a as a mom because I'm
82:15 - inactive so I have to post on Reddit and
82:17 - like you see me posting on Reddit just
82:19 - say hey great job like I mean it I am
82:22 - impressed by the project he just
82:23 - submitted but like I'm also trying to
82:27 - get reddit's algorithm to uh to say like
82:30 - okay he's he's active again he can add
82:32 - new me as a mod now so uh but but yeah
82:34 - like that like the amount of time I
82:36 - spent on social media is like
82:37 - vanishingly small and it used to be this
82:39 - huge good part like I've I've definitely
82:41 - mellowed out not spending time there um
82:45 - yeah not that it's not incredibly useful
82:47 - yeah but but yeah you've worked for
82:49 - yourself for a long time like have how
82:51 - do you sort of stay motivated because it
82:53 - feels like you're working on like 20
82:55 - different amazing things at the same
82:57 - time well thank you uh I'm I'm glad it
83:00 - looks good from the outside because
83:02 - every organization from the inside like
83:03 - every person's life I think feels like
83:05 - it's probably a mess because you have
83:06 - access to all the gritty details um but
83:10 - I mean like
83:12 - like one of our guests um Phoebe vong
83:15 - Fidel um she talked about how like
83:17 - having kids was like the biggest
83:19 - productivity Boon in her life cuz
83:21 - suddenly she had to be accountable of
83:23 - the kid and it took up so much of her
83:24 - time that she had to figure out how to
83:26 - like structure the rest of her time so
83:28 - that she could be as productive as she
83:29 - was before she had kids and that's a
83:31 - that's a great interview recommend
83:32 - everybody check it out um but but like
83:35 - you know she learned like you she
83:36 - learned a code at like 36 or something
83:38 - right and uh it it was having that
83:40 - extrinsic pressure of like I've got this
83:42 - kid that's constantly crying and I need
83:44 - to get things done in between dealing
83:45 - with this kid and like I I would say
83:48 - like the first few years of free COC I
83:50 - was just pure ID I don't know what to
83:53 - say but but it's was just like like I
83:55 - really don't like for-profit education I
83:57 - don't like student debt I don't like
83:59 - like it it was kind of like a rage that
84:01 - was driving me and it's a dark why yeah
84:05 - my dark why I like I am so upset that
84:08 - we're in the most prosperous country in
84:10 - the world and that there's suffering
84:11 - that there's homelessness that there are
84:13 - uh people who don't have access to
84:16 - opportunity just because of where they
84:18 - were born if they were born in like
84:20 - Appalachia or you know uh Middle America
84:23 - like where I was where I grew up and
84:25 - there just was an expectation that like
84:26 - you'd be a construction worker when you
84:27 - grew up or something like that right
84:29 - like uh I definitely that was what fired
84:33 - me up initially was just like wanting to
84:35 - destroy the for-profit education complex
84:39 - and make education free like I and I
84:41 - still feel that way but I've mellowed
84:43 - out a lot and a lot of my productivity
84:45 - is not based on emotion it's based on
84:47 - like okay like I've got systems that
84:49 - keep me accountable like I wake up at
84:51 - 7:00 a.m. every day because I've got
84:54 - kids and they're like roosters and they
84:55 - jump out of bed at 7:00 a.m. full energy
84:58 - and you're up when they're up right
85:00 - there's no sleeping through kids jumping
85:02 - on your bed and like uh you know
85:04 - stealing your phone and watching like
85:05 - Zelda videos at full blast and stuff
85:07 - like that um yeah so so like that that
85:11 - is kind of and and then just like all
85:13 - the normal diet exercise like if you
85:15 - live in one place for long enough uh and
85:17 - you you establish some routines you you
85:19 - can kind of Coast on those routines uh
85:21 - like you know like like today I woke up
85:24 - took my kids to school uh I went to the
85:26 - YMCA I exercised I walked home entire
85:29 - time I was thinking about this interview
85:30 - and like preparing and I I did my
85:32 - research I had like three pages of notes
85:34 - I was you know questions I was going to
85:35 - ask it's just a bunch of prep uh and
85:38 - then that prep carries you you know
85:40 - sorry for that little like weird inhale
85:42 - thing um I'm not going to edit it out
85:44 - because I don't edit okay keep
85:47 - um yeah uh I I feel like people need a
85:51 - source of like real human beings on the
85:52 - internet who are not fronting and Max
85:54 - you know who were just being themselves
85:56 - and uh not trying to impress people I'm
85:58 - not trying to impress anybody I'm trying
86:00 - to teach people and you know potentially
86:02 - Enlighten them about the nature of
86:04 - reality it's not these perfect human
86:06 - beings it's not like James Bond not
86:08 - getting killed the first time he goes on
86:10 - a mission because he's a ostentatious
86:12 - bastard you
86:13 - know he be the worst spy the real spies
86:17 - you never even hear about right so
86:20 - anyway
86:22 - true so um
86:24 - I want to draw some more insight out of
86:26 - you because you just have some and and I
86:28 - also want to be mindful of your time uh
86:30 - so uh we have like 13 minutes I'm just
86:32 - going to start firing away all right
86:33 - you're very you're very vocal about uh
86:38 - how how you look things up all the time
86:40 - like this is a huge part of your message
86:42 - to developers it's like developers are
86:44 - not omniscient they don't have like Tic
86:47 - memories where they've just committed
86:48 - the mdn to their brain right you're
86:50 - constantly looking things up and can you
86:52 - talk about that and like how you did you
86:55 - ever did you feel weird about that when
86:56 - you were like aren't developers supposed
86:58 - to be smart and just know this
87:00 - stuff yeah I mean I think I was lucky
87:04 - that I when I was starting out in my
87:06 - career like I had other developers
87:07 - around me and I think it was it seemed
87:09 - pretty accepted that everyone looked up
87:11 - stuff all the time so I think that at
87:14 - least I didn't have any sort of like you
87:16 - know false impressions of what a real
87:19 - real developer does but I noticed that
87:21 - when I started putting out some videos I
87:24 - think early on I did these live coding
87:26 - um live streams actually on my channel
87:29 - and I would try to build a website from
87:30 - a design which is my whole shtick I
87:32 - guess and I would spend a lot of time
87:35 - looking things up on stack Overflow or
87:36 - reading the docs and I used to remember
87:38 - getting all these comments from people
87:40 - being like Oh my gosh like real
87:43 - developers like do lookup stuff and so I
87:45 - think that really like sort of stuck
87:47 - with me that if you're just learning how
87:49 - to code on your own and you don't have
87:51 - any knowledge about the industry like
87:52 - it's very easy to think like oh these
87:54 - people on YouTube or professionals
87:57 - working at companies like they don't
87:58 - have to look anything up like everything
87:59 - is just like living in their brain
88:01 - 247 and it's just like a library up
88:04 - there but that's really not true because
88:06 - there's just so much knowledge there's
88:08 - so many areas in programming and web
88:10 - development and also things are changing
88:11 - all the time especially now nowadays um
88:15 - yeah things just change so quickly so
88:17 - you have to that's just part of the
88:19 - routine so I think it's really important
88:21 - for me to like keep it real and just
88:23 - like show people people like real web
88:25 - developers like look up stuff all the
88:27 - time yeah and it's not going to get any
88:30 - better like like it's always going to be
88:31 - like that because by definition the
88:33 - field is like people operating at the
88:35 - frontier of what the tools are capable
88:37 - of if the tool abstracted something away
88:38 - then you wouldn't need to do that
88:39 - anymore so you're always going to be
88:41 - working with like higher and higher
88:42 - levels of abstraction probably unless
88:44 - you have like really crazy constraints
88:45 - like we need this chip to work on this
88:47 - satellite and it needs to work for 2,000
88:49 - years or something like that right yeah
88:50 - so
88:52 - um Okay so you know those kind of edge
88:55 - cases aside like you're going to be
88:56 - using lots of tools you're going to be
88:58 - using the raw compute power and like all
89:00 - the other stuff that gets better every
89:01 - year what kind of uh when you were
89:03 - developing uh websites and apps as a
89:06 - consultant what were kind of your bread
89:07 - and butter types of elements and things
89:09 - that you just build over and over again
89:11 - H that's a really good question
89:15 - um I think like the whole like card UI
89:19 - where it's like you have different cards
89:20 - with like photos and like things like
89:22 - that and I think
89:24 - just when I was learning it there was no
89:27 - flex box initially so you had to like
89:29 - lay out things with CSS float which was
89:32 - kind of a nightmare um but yeah I think
89:35 - just like getting good at these sort of
89:37 - multi column layouts that stack to one
89:39 - column on mobile like that was I would
89:41 - say 90% of my job um working in
89:44 - advertising and marketing yeah were
89:47 - there any UI kind of dark patterns that
89:50 - you're like I'm I refuse to do
89:52 - this I mean I mean personally I think
89:57 - carousels are just a huge waste of time
90:01 - and they don't work because no one never
90:03 - clicks to the second slide in the
90:05 - carousel but carousels basically exist
90:07 - so that you can tell the marketing
90:09 - higher ups that the content they wanted
90:12 - to put on the homepage is on the
90:13 - homepage it's just on slide seven um so
90:17 - I I consider Carousel is a little bit of
90:19 - a pattern that I would not I don't think
90:22 - anything that's like an anti- pattern
90:23 - but like a dark pattern like something
90:25 - that you think is like manipulative of
90:27 - users or maybe something that where
90:30 - there's like an ethical gray area oh
90:32 - like Adobe unsubscribing yeah or
90:35 - LinkedIn the the the uh master of dark
90:38 - patterns like hey would you like to tell
90:39 - your friends that that oh your friend's
90:42 - not LinkedIn would you like to like
90:43 - import your inbox and every single
90:45 - person you've ever like emailed and like
90:47 - send them an email say hey why aren't
90:48 - you on LinkedIn they did that like five
90:50 - times like they said they do it once and
90:52 - even the way they asked it was really
90:53 - sketchy anyway I don't want to hammer L
90:56 - too much but they they did so many
90:58 - sketch things to uh to build that out
90:59 - initially but but but you said AI uh
91:02 - Adobe like unsubscribe but are there any
91:04 - dark patterns that uh you you've like
91:07 - felt really bad about like implementing
91:08 - just because your boss told you to
91:10 - implement or is there anything that like
91:12 - an ethical line that you'll never cross
91:13 - again yeah I mean I was fortunate that I
91:17 - think I didn't have I was never asked to
91:18 - do something that I felt ethically like
91:20 - questionable about um but yeah I think
91:22 - anything that like leverages is like
91:25 - your real life information or personal
91:28 - information I think you know for social
91:31 - credit or whatever on the app is like
91:33 - something that I think I would never I
91:36 - would never want to do
91:38 - that um yeah anything that that tries to
91:41 - get you to import your entire like
91:43 - contact list from your phone to the and
91:46 - give all your personal data to the app
91:48 - is like I think pretty
91:50 - bad yeah 100% agreed um so in terms of
91:55 - like gradually you're somebody who
91:57 - focuses on expanding their skills all
91:59 - the time in terms of strategies you've
92:03 - used to like learn things like what is
92:06 - something that if if somebody wanted to
92:08 - learn an entire new area like let's say
92:10 - they're a front end developer and they
92:11 - want to learn backend so they can do
92:12 - full stack development like are there
92:13 - any particular strategies or advice that
92:15 - you would give to somebody that wanted
92:17 - to absorb an entire new you know Corpus
92:20 - of knowledge yeah I think if I was
92:23 - trying to to learn something new in
92:25 - programming I think I would definitely
92:27 - go to YouTube first I would go to
92:29 - YouTube and see what videos are kind of
92:31 - the most popular for for example a
92:34 - search term for like you know xyz4
92:37 - beginners um I think I'd also probably I
92:39 - would probably check out Reddit I think
92:40 - Reddit is a good source of like real
92:43 - information from like real people
92:46 - usually especially for like learning I
92:48 - think it's really good um because
92:49 - there's always going to be someone
92:50 - posting like I want to learn this and
92:52 - that like how do I get started and
92:54 - then people who are more ahead of you
92:56 - have like good recommendations I feel
92:58 - like um yeah so I think
93:02 - just I think learning how to just figure
93:06 - learning how to identify what a good
93:08 - resource is versus a not good resource I
93:10 - think is kind of important um yeah are
93:14 - there any like telltale signs uh what is
93:16 - going to be like my biggest concern is
93:18 - not necessarily the quality of the
93:19 - resource but like how much of the
93:21 - resource you're going to get before they
93:22 - slim a pay wall your face and like oh I
93:25 - just spent like half an hour learning
93:26 - this tutorial and suddenly like I can't
93:28 - Advance any further you know like pay
93:31 - walls are really annoying I understand
93:32 - that that you know code academy and
93:34 - websites like that have to keep the
93:35 - lights on uh but uh it's all like
93:39 - sometimes I wonder if they're not
93:40 - sufficiently forthcoming about what the
93:41 - course actually includes for free before
93:44 - you have to start like you know
93:45 - inputting your credit card but sure are
93:48 - there any um just just to re rephrase my
93:51 - questions this is a Meandering thing um
93:53 - are there are there any like telltale
93:55 - signs of like hey this is going to be
93:56 - too superficial like I shouldn't cuz you
93:59 - can watch the same you know C in 3
94:02 - minutes not to pick on because he does
94:04 - it inest Fire Ship does like ingest how
94:07 - C Works in three minutes there's not an
94:08 - expectation you're learn CP in 3 minutes
94:11 - but like you can watch the same like
94:13 - HTML explained for forgetters like 30
94:15 - minute tutorial like you can watch 20 of
94:18 - those and you wouldn't really be any
94:19 - better than if you just watched one or
94:21 - two of them right like uh how do you
94:23 - identify a a good
94:26 - resource um I personally I sort of look
94:29 - at the tone of how the information is
94:31 - conveyed so if someone starts the video
94:34 - like how to learn HTML and they're like
94:36 - what's up like I'm here to show you and
94:38 - it it feels a little bit too like um
94:41 - there's like a certain energy that like
94:43 - sort of makes me naturally distrust the
94:45 - person but so I feel like and this is
94:47 - again just maybe my own personal
94:48 - preferences but if I feel like the
94:50 - person teaching me something seems like
94:52 - they are more like serious or more it
94:56 - seems like they've really put time into
94:58 - explaining things well I think that's a
94:59 - good sign I think also you can look at a
95:01 - channel and this is just for YouTube
95:04 - resources but you know for example Kevin
95:07 - pal all his videos are about CSS they
95:10 - are incredibly in depth and I think
95:12 - people kind of recognize that over time
95:15 - um and they and he explains things
95:17 - really well and so I think that looking
95:21 - at sort of their body of work on their
95:23 - Channel and seeing how you know either
95:26 - shallow or how in-depth they go on the
95:28 - topics I think if you do a little bit of
95:31 - research and just kind
95:33 - of yeah see for yourself like how the
95:36 - teaching kind of sounds so I think yeah
95:39 - whether they're talking authoritatively
95:41 - or it looks like they're reading a
95:42 - script that was probably generated by
95:43 - gbt or something
95:45 - right yeah yeah uh and Kevin Powell the
95:49 - king of CSS he does not like it when I
95:50 - call him that but that is like the the
95:52 - moniker that he has uh he's given by the
95:56 - community yes uh last question what are
96:00 - some biggest what do you think the
96:02 - biggest misconceptions uh people have
96:05 - about learning the code when they're
96:06 - just watching a bunch of YouTube videos
96:08 - like what are some misconceptions that
96:11 - you want to just shoot down real quick
96:13 - to like reassure people no that's that's
96:14 - not how it really
96:17 - is I would say um you don't have to be
96:22 - on The Cutting Edge this might be an
96:24 - unpopular opinion but it is my opinion I
96:26 - don't operate on The Cutting Edge and I
96:28 - don't think you need to excuse me um I
96:32 - think like especially when it comes to
96:34 - content creators in programming like
96:36 - you're trying to make a video that gets
96:38 - views so people will always make videos
96:40 - on like the next you know new hottest
96:43 - technology out there or newest framework
96:45 - or whatever but the reality is a lot of
96:48 - companies are using jQuery or they're
96:51 - using Wordpress or you know they're not
96:54 - using like the newest CSS feature that's
96:56 - not like um supported by like the
97:00 - majority of browsers so I would say
97:02 - don't worry about learning the newest
97:05 - hottest thing right now I would say just
97:08 - stick to the basics especially if you're
97:09 - at the beginning of your Learning
97:10 - Journey and you can always learn newer
97:13 - things like later on CU if you learn the
97:15 - new things now they may or may not be
97:18 - hit the mainstream and then you'll have
97:20 - in some ways maybe wasted some time that
97:22 - you could have spent just kind of
97:24 - focusing on the basics so that's my
97:26 - biggest piece of advice yeah 100% that's
97:30 - a great note to end on Jessica it's been
97:32 - such a blast learning more about you
97:34 - learning from you I've got like 160
97:36 - lines of notes in my uh editor here I've
97:40 - learned a tremendous amount and uh it's
97:42 - just such an amazing blessing to have
97:45 - you in the developer Community creating
97:48 - tutorials focusing on delivering
97:50 - substance for the people right and and
97:53 - uh you know we're all excited about your
97:54 - your big course that you you're working
97:56 - on best of luck continuing progress on
97:58 - that and again I just want to emphasize
98:00 - like over the years you've contributed
98:02 - so many tutorials to the Freo Camp uh
98:06 - text based like publication got some
98:08 - video courses from you like I am always
98:11 - really really hyped up and really jazzed
98:13 - whenever Bo mentions oh yeah I heard
98:14 - from Jessica you know so so like thank
98:17 - you for everything you're doing for the
98:19 - community yeah hopefully I can do more
98:21 - once this course is done with but yeah
98:24 - yeah love the free code Camp
98:25 - Community absolutely well thanks again
98:28 - for just providing like a really cool
98:30 - like I guess model of someone who has
98:32 - gone out and uh blazed their own path
98:35 - and who has transitioned from working in
98:38 - a field that like basically just
98:39 - cratered um I mean you talk about like
98:43 - having to go work as a temp with a
98:44 - college degree it's it's not a position
98:46 - that I did that too I worked uh doing
98:50 - like their temp agencies in Oklahoma
98:52 - City and I did that that whole thing for
98:54 - for a few years and it was miserable uh
98:56 - but but being able to find a way out of
98:57 - that being able to build up a skill set
98:59 - being able to you know do have a choice
99:02 - whether you want to do freelance work or
99:04 - for or continue to work for previous
99:06 - employers or work for your your friends
99:08 - new employers and stuff like that or um
99:11 - just continue to create content on your
99:13 - own like having that level of agency
99:14 - that level of security that that uh
99:17 - being being the master of your own
99:19 - destiny I think it's incredibly
99:20 - inspiring and I love how you don't
99:22 - sugarcoat any of this and you don't seem
99:24 - to take any of this for granted you're
99:25 - out there getting things done and you're
99:27 - working just as hard as you were before
99:29 - so uh it's a huge source of inspiration
99:31 - for me awesome yeah thanks so much for
99:34 - having me on yeah well everybody until
99:37 - next week happy coding

Cleaned transcript:

the first one to two years were incredibly stressful because I constantly felt like I was going to fail and they were going to fire me for incompetence so it was a lot of Googling it was a lot of like looking up at deack overflow trying to do as much research on my own before I actually asked one of the other developers because I was also very afraid of annoying the other developers if I bug them too much with questions so it was like I would say it was pretty difficult for me at that time but I was learning so much like I think my brain was just like expanding with the amount of things I would learn welcome back to the free Cod Camp podcast I'm Quincy Larsson teacher and founder of freecodecamp.org each week we're bringing you Insight from developers Founders and ambitious people getting into Tech this week we're joined by Jessica Chand AKA coder coder she's a soft software engineer who has worked in the field for more than a decade and interestingly she studied Photography in school and she never even took a programming class uh and yet she's had this illustrious career so we're going to learn a lot from her welcome Jessica yeah thanks so much for having me yeah I uh I've been a longtime admirer of your work uh of the caliber of your husband's animation sound design like all the production you put into these amazing uh video courses that you create and just your fun sense of humor and like it's just like if there was like a word to describe Cod or quer I would describe it as like fun I mean that may seem kind of like a like a short word to describe it but it is fun to watch your videos that's awesome yeah thank you that is definitely one one thing we we aim for with the the videos yeah so I want to like go way back as we always do and just start with like kind of how you got into Tech because my understanding is you don't have any formal training en coding and in fact like your career kind of like evaporated early on as the field just fundamentally changed and uh you you found yourself like working kind of like in those kind of temp office type jobs and stuff uh for quite a while like but before we get to that like maybe you can talk a little bit about your early days and your early Ambitions yeah so as you said I didn't you know go to school for anything programming wise but I was always into computers even from a pretty young age um like I remember going to the library and checking out like a book on basic programming and trying to like do that on the computer at home um and then also in I think it was middle school or High School my sister and I ran a BBS this is pre internet days a bullet and board system so that was and that was something that I kind of set up myself um and yeah that was super fun um back in the back in those days yeah how do bbs's work I mean I know because I used to use them but but like what is running it a BBS like uh of course that's like a major plot point in the show Halt and Catch Fire like uh they set up a BBS in the 80s but maybe maybe you could talk about what that was like cuz yeah how did you get special software did you have like a special server um we ran it off of one of the computers that we had at home so we had two computers at home so one of them you would have to run the software to run the BBS and people would actually have to physically call your the phone number attached to the computer in order to connect to the BBS from their computer um with these different protocols and everything was sort of asy art you know very slow slow speeds like 2400 bod modems and all that kind of stuff um but yeah you could log into the BBS you could there were message boards there were games you could play they were actually really fun you could also upload and download files so yeah it was just a way for people to find community and just like you know have fun in their spare time yeah and what kind of software did you have on that because I remember like when I dial into a BBS there would be like places you could like leave messages for other people kind of like a like an altnet uh uset like precursor uh but there were also lots of interactive games where you could only do so much every day so it like encouraged you to come back the next day and like bu buff up the stats of your character and like explore it was like kind of like text based Adventure type stuff yeah for sure um I ran it off of a software called Renegade so you could you didn't have to code it from scratch so you could download these BBS software packages I guess and then install them on your computer and so you didn't have to do any actual programming to really set it up you just had to kind of install it and configure it um so yeah no programming needed what do people use it for I used it to play games they were really fun um there was like legend of the red dragon the sort of D and D themed game where you you know fought monsters and try to get gold um there's also kind of a Star Wars themed game called trade Wars where you would trade different um resources and you could like save up to get like the Enterprise type uh ship and they like fangi and stuff yeah it was it was fun fun times that's pretty cool so it's basically like kind of like a Commerce simulator where you you have like uh yeah that sounds fun and how many people could use the BBS concurrently like did you have multiple phone lines um it was limited to one person per phone line and we only had one phone line so yeah how did how did uh your parents feel about like having that phone line tied up all the time we yeah we're pretty I would I guess privileged because my parents were willing to pay for a second phone line that was dedicated to the BBS um but yeah I limited to one person at a time which is kind of mindblowing you know considering nowadays everything is like happening at the same time yeah maybe you could talk about like how you get the word out as a kid like did you just tell your friends at school or like how did people discover that there was this phone number they could dial into with their modem and play games and stuff I think there were places you could list your BBS but my sister and I were members of other local bbs's and had made friends and stuff so you just kind of tell your friends about your own BBS and because ours was smaller it was you were less likely to get a busy signal when you tried to call in which I think the friends really liked so it was kind of like a just like a hangout place um for like us and our online friends yeah I mean that's so cool because it's like very local I mean it yeah I don't know if there's like a an equivalent on the internet right now because everything is concurrent like just because I'm looking at somebody's Instagram feed doesn't mean somebody else can't also look at it right or any sort of synchronous like chat type experience like using slack or using uh Discord or something like that like everything you just take for granted that it's like a multitenant operation right um yeah so yeah I can imagine all the constraints in terms and and also the fact that it's like dealing with extremely low amounts of data so everything text ask text yeah that's so cool like it was a different world how did you even discover like how did it like pop in your mind because I would use other people's bbs's but it never occurred to me like I should create a BBS on my own like what do you remember like was there like some uh moment of Revelation like I could do this I think looking back I think I've always had this interest in building things so before I became web developer I taught myself HTML and basic CSS in high school like this is back in the geoc C's days and I just would kind of make blogs for myself but it wasn't because I had all these things I wanted to say it's because I just enjoyed setting up the the blog websites and I remember my friend was like sort of making fun of me a little bit because I kept just like having new blogs and I would have to send her like the new link every time um but it didn't really sort of cement in my understanding that like I enjoyed making making you know blogs after blogs cuz I enjoyed building websites um but yeah I think I just always liked making things and Building Things yeah well um maybe you can talk a little bit about like your early days and and you know what your aspirations were around High School age um I think in high school I was probably I was a very goody two shoes and I think I wanted to be a doctor um cuz my dad he's tired now but he was a doctor um so I think that was kind of the the limits of my aspirations for some reason I didn't realize that like you could be a web developer or a programmer back then I'm not sure why but I just I didn't really think about you know what job out of all the jobs in the world can I do I think I just sort of had a very limited sort mind mindset at that point yeah and I think that's that's a common thing uh among like a lot of people that come on the fre cocaine podcast is like they have like this mentality like oh I'll be like a doctor or a lawyer or a dentist or or some kind of other type of engineer like because that's what the people you know that are older than me seem to be doing in these Social Circles and they seem to be doing well they've got like the house and they they've got you know stable income and they they're eventually going to be able to retire and stuff like that so so you kind of look at those people and you're like wow if I just had a lot of money and I could basically just do whatever I want and like have like a really good you know sound system or whatever it was you know we aspired to when we were kids you you kind of like look at the job as just something you do as a means to an end to just have a relaxing enjoyable life and and be able to have a family and stuff like that like that's how a lot of people I think look at uh when they're younger they're just like okay what do I do that like being a doctor you get tons of respect right uh like people call you doctor right and and like if if if somebody like has like a collapses on the sidewalk or something they're like is there a doctor and you run over and everybody parts to make way for you so I can definitely understand why like I would definitely say that's the most common thing that people who come on the free C Camp podcast want to be when they grow up as a doctor uh but for you that that wasn't in the cards and it probably wasn't for academic reasons but like why did you ultimately not decide to pursue yeah um yeah I think the the doctor thing didn't last very long um so College I took I think intro to chemistry and I almost failed it and I think after that class I was like I don't think this is for me because I knew the classes would only get harder and harder with like organic chemistry and like all this kind of stuff so I dropped that and then I didn't know what to major in and I eventually took a drawing class and I loved it and this art is something that I had done you know since high school I took a lot of Art and photography classes in high school and I just you know really enjoyed that so I thought oh maybe I'll try majoring in art so that's kind of how I got into majoring in photography in school that's so interesting like I I just assume because you're like frankly you're like a really smart person like I definitely look at you and say she's probably like way smarter than me um and the reason I think that uh you know like if you look at like the caliber of your work and the way you carry yourself and talk and and stuff like this person is extremely organized and so I just presumed oh it's probably not an academic reason do you ever wonder if like that was like a weer class or some sort of like like that if you could have actually probably like powered through uh doing like Premed and then medical school and stuff like that or do you genuinely think it wasn't you didn't have it in you I think I could have I think the the problem this is I think this is just my personal situation I like didn't have a really big social life in high school I didn't really have that many friends that I would hang out with so the only thing I had to do was study and read books so that's basically all I did when I was younger then I went to college and you know college is like this new experience you meet all these new people so I had a lot of friends and so I in high school I didn't have to really have time management skills where I'm choosing to study over doing something fun but in college I ended up doing a lot of fun things as opposed to studying so I would like routinely hang out with people and then I would have to stay up till like 300 a.m. studying and trying to finish my work um or I would just stay up till 300 a.m. cuz I was hanging out with people so like yeah I did not have great time management skills like at all um when I was in college which is sad to say but that's kind of what happened so I think that's that's the reason why it didn't really work out but I I don't think I would have enjoyed all the different science classes to be honest yeah yeah so you're into art um so to to resolve that tangent you're into art and uh you're interested uh like like where does this drawing class take you in terms of like what's your progression as a creative thinker and and maker um yeah so I think the drawing class the the professor actually was like asking me she she was a painter who was doing like a temporary thing at my school and she was like I why are you not majoring in art so I think I just took that as a big compliment which you know was and that's kind of how I decided to you know major in that um but in terms of artistic uh skills or whatever I think that I actually didn't learn very much photography at all because my professor was very handsoff so he would just say all right go take pictures and then we would take pictures and develop them and print them and then we would like hang them up and have critiques and that was it he didn't really like teach us very much so I actually taught myself more after college um cuz I lived in Boston for a long time and I was unemployed for about a month after I moved there so all I did was walk around the city and with my little Sony point and shoot camera and I just like shot photos all around the city for you know that became one of my hobbies and I think that kind of practice over and over helped me to really develop better photographic skills so I'm yeah I feel like you can teach yourself a lot just through trying things yeah 100% I I can I can get behind that sentiment because that's how I like kind of root Force learning coding and other things like that and it sounds like so one interesting note about what you're there was actually a study like and I'm always like really load the quote like social science studies because they can't necessarily be uh reproduced the finings can't be reproduced NE early but uh I think there was like they B it was photography and and they they had like some Professor who basically said like told some of the students like I want you to just take one picture but I want it to be a really good one and the other one just go take a ton of pictures and it turned out that the people that just incidentally took a whole lot of pictures like they were practicing and their their photos were better subjectively how how do you judge a better photo but like yeah the the the researchers found that like the the students or the professors like like that I'm sorry I'm totally butchering the findings but the point of the study was that like it you know you can stand all day there and talk about the theory what what you know makes for a good composition of a shot what's like the hierarchy and like all these other different considerations right I know nothing about photography uh but but at the same time like if you just go out and practice the actual skill maybe a lot of this you'll into it and you'll build it up so maybe your professor was kind of like the the equivalent of like those old uh you know um the master from the Kung Fu movies like standing there pass you know you know basically just just giving you like very vinary feedback on your work but it does sound like you some critique right um but but like maybe he had kind of internalized that like to become a good photographer you just got to go out and take a lot of photos right a lot of a lot of shots on goal so to speak um yeah that's cool so you you were living in Boston so this is after college we can we can go to Life After College right like for a photography major um which I mean I I think if you took like all the different college majors and you rank them like you know Premed and like software engineering and things like that like computer science I think is like the highest compensating degree you can study overall like over like the next 20 years like something like that but like if you were to stack rank those like I'm pretty sure photography would be toward the bottom in terms of like remunerative careers I apologize if you can hear like some lawnmowing stuff this is just like that one day of the month can you is that coming through to you at all I cannot hear it so I think you're good yeah well it dodged I don't have to go out and like politely asked the gentleman to like come back later okay so um yeah so I guess my point is like no no shade at all the photography Majors like I uh you know I'm an English major so that's also toward the bottom of the list but like when you arrive at Boston what are you thinking like why did you move to Boston first of all cuz that's like a big expensive city and like you said you were unemployed for a month like did you have a job lined up or what what were your what was your thinking at this point in your life I I went I was like kind of already in the New England area and some of my friends had moved to Boston already so it seemed like the next logical step to just kind of move to the nearest big city um but yeah I looking back I can't I almost can't believe I did this but I just was like okay I'll just move there I'll find a job once I'm there um and the only thought I had was I'm going to try to be an artist because that was the only like I guess job that they really talked about at school they didn't really train us to yeah think about other jobs like you know I don't know going into advertising or other things like that being a commercial photographer like everything was about about the fine art stuff so anyway in Boston I was just looking for jobs related to photography and so I just called up all the Photo Labs in the area and one of them like ended up giving me a job so that's kind of how I fell into I worked in a commercial photo lab and yeah that was a that was a fun experience but I did not make much money at all so when you say like a photo lab like where you going to get your photos developed like with the chemicals and stuff yep yeah so they they serviced commercial um photographers so it was a really large lab the professional photographers would come in with all their roles of film from their shoots and we would develop them we had a film guy who just all he did all day was develop all the film um and my job was to make contact sheets from the strips of film where you can see it's like the size of the negatives but you can see what's on them um before printing um so that was one of my jobs but yeah that was a it was a really fun experience but but definitely not doesn't exist as much anymore today yeah yeah I mean with the EV a digital photography that like kind of like probably made that industry go the way of like buggy whips like there are still some people that sell buggy whips like there there are like multi hundredy old companies that produce these buggy whips and it could be that like 100 years from now there are still Photo Labs but they're going to be probably very Niche yes and yeah it's not like a giant industry anymore right uh like I wouldn't be surprised if that that industry had undergone like a 90% you know reduction over the past 20 years for sure if not more so okay so you're working in this photo lab uh servicing uh professional uh you know photographers probably like wedding photographers the people that do like yearbook I don't know like who who are the commercial what are what are the jobs in photography how did how did the photography industry work at the time um from what I could tell just from the people coming in they were like um commercial portrait photographers they do you know newspaper and magazine photos there were wedding photographers um and there also some just like fine artists who would come in um and they would have us print their their photos for them um so it was it was kind of a range I'm sure there were some like hobbyist photographers who were just kind of doing it for fun too yeah did did you have any ankling like hey I could do what they're doing and like go out and like make kind of like a consultancy out of this or like be a freelance photographer I don't know why well I sort of tried I did sort of second shooting for some wedding photographers and I interned with one of the commercial photographers who came in but for some reason it never really stuck with me in terms of oh this is something I want to do um it just seemed like I think I just didn't know how to even break into the field and I didn't have enough of a maybe desire to be a photographer to do the research to figure out how to do the business side of things things so yeah yeah I mean this is kind of like sorry I didn't mean to interrupt you there's a little bit of legy uh yeah this is like an indictment of higher education that you studied photography for like four years and you still have like no idea how to actually like go out and make money as a photographer and and you're not even sure that you would want to even if you knew how but you know college just kind of put you onto this track and they give you a major important major and then there's so much momentum behind it and it's so hard to switch but I mean it does sound to me kind of like uh if I can like be probably over prescriptive in hand wavy but it sounds like you know uh you said you didn't have a a big interesting social life uh when you were younger you go to college college is where a lot of people if you're fortunate enough to go to college like their social life kind of burgeons and the whole world opens up right it's not just like High School never ends type uh you know clicky things it's like real people kind of like becoming friends and and around common interests and stuff like that and a lot of that kind of like high school nonsense kind of like breaks down to an extent like once you get out of like fraternity sority spheres and stuff uh and I'm not trying to like knock those or anything but like I was never in a fraternity and like I didn't have a lot of respect for like the fraternities and stuff like we we always kind of looked a SCS at them if that's how you pronounce the word like oh you know like that's like we're here to learn you know like like I kind of like elevated myself above like the people doing like you know drinking excessively and stuff like that so um but it sounds like you had kind of like a social Awakening in college and then uh maybe the fact that that that was all happening distracted you from academics to an extent and when the professor was like oh you should consider being an artist or wanting to switch to Art you're like sure it doesn't sound like there was like a ton of Liberation and like longterm planning during those four years would you agree with that sentiment I I don't want to mischaracterize it no I would definitely agree I think I just didn't know what was possible so you don't know what you don't know and I didn't really understand how I needed to think about trying to find a career or you know choosing you know which one I wanted to do um so I think it was yeah a lot of fumbling and just not really knowing what what I wanted in life I think back then but you're in Boston this very expensive city uh very you know prestigious City like that's where like Harvard is MIT there's so many uh like big important companies based out of Boston there's so much research being done there it's it's like a really important and it's one of the oldest cities in the United States so it's got like this very long stored history and um and you're just kind of working at a photo lab and like did you feel like ambition going to and from work every day like at what point did the more ambitious Jessica Chan start to materialize the one that we all know and respect today I think it took a while I think I I really just didn't know what I wanted to do when I was in my 20s so I think it wasn't really until I started working um at this small web dev shop in Boston that I was thinking oh I can like sort of stay here and learn how to program they were doing like sort of backend like database work that's kind of where I started um how did you get how did you get that job um so as you probably saw in my like YouTube video I did a lot of temp office jobs for I would say a few years so this is just you know like it was fine work but um it wasn't something that I necessarily felt passionate about but I was looking for a job at one point cuz my like temp work had ended or whatever and I looked on Craigslist for just random jobs and I was like oh I could probably do data entry because that was one of the things that I'd done at my temp jobs so I found this data entry position in Boston and it ended up being at this small web dev shop and I got the job there started out doing data entry but then they ended up teaching me like SQL database work and doing net um programming and Microsoft Access for those of you who remember um so yeah there was that was kind of like my entrance into like the world of web development even though I had taught myself how to build websites when I was younger it was always just something I did for fun and it just never clicked in my brain that this is something that people can get a job in and also make like really good money so for some reason it just took me falling into that job and realizing like oh I have these like skills that I can develop and then use to apply for you know actual web development jobs cuz the job that I got from Craigslist was like very contract like temporary stuff yeah yeah it's almost like Destiny's way of like you know repeatedly like shoving you in this direction yeah um so so you're starting to learn the skills how do you go about learning this giant Corpus of knowledge it sounds like you already knew a little bit about you know Microsoft access database tool that comes with Microsoft Office like the PowerPoint everybody knows how to use PowerPoint everybody knows how to use Excel and Word but not as many people know how to use access because yeah the learning curve is a little bit steeper um but it sounds like you were you were learning relevant Tech skills just on the job and you were being pushed in this more technical Direction like do you remember a clear point where somebody entrusted you with actually building something do you remember what your first project was I mean I started out and I think this is what I think people realize when you get your first job in programming or web development or whatever is that you're not necessarily going to be tasked with building this entire giant project from scratch most likely you're going to be given tasks to do in existing projects that the company already has had running so that's what I did so I had to work on this website and I had to for example you know add or subtract um drop down menu items so I had to learn how to do that so it's very like task by task based or I had to learn how to um make changes to the websites that they needed with CSS or um just like learning how to run reports and write reports and SQL to get you know data from one of their clients so it was very much like I need to do this thing because my boss told me to if I don't know how to do it I need to figure it out yeah so uh essentially you had the benefit of having somebody tell you what to do and give you these missions and then each mission was like a growth opportunity uh and and how did you figure stuff out like because again you have no formal programming training you are a hobbyist like web designer I guess um and you have very rudimentary skills probably but you do have the benefit of kind of like a sense of Aesthetics you have like an eye from photography and from taking art class and stuff like that uh maybe you could talk about like the like your Ascent as far as like gaining more confidence uh in your abilities as you ran these kind of like fetch Quests for your for your boss yeah I think like looking back I honestly really lucked out with that job um it paid pretty terribly and also like I wasn't paid for eight hours a day I was only paid for like the actual tasks that they could build to their clients so depending on how busy they were it I might only have like 30 minutes or like a couple hours a day but what I did learn was how to learn or how to find solutions to things um because my boss would explain one time how to do something like how to you know run a squl query and how to write it and then I would have to do the same thing for a similar task and he got very grumpy if I had to ask him how if I had to ask him to explain something to me more than once so he actually would give me um and I think there were a couple other people working there at the time we all had notebooks that we had to leave at the office and we had to take notes um so if he would explain something I would write it down how to do it and then if I had to do the same task in the future I could just refer back to my notebook and be like oh this is how to do it and then if you do that five or 10 times eventually you learn how to do it without having to refer to your notes so that process times you know a hundred or however many times I just learned everything kind of Peace Meal which was one way to learn I think it worked out for me um because you learn real skills applicable skills like right away um you know I didn't learn things from a class and then have to figure out how that works in the real world later on so it was it was an interesting way to learn I'm not sure if that way exists as much anymore because this is back before coding boot camps existed so in some ways timing wise I really was fortunate in in terms of being able to find this job and also use my skills to land another Junior Dev job um a couple years later so I think the world has just changed a lot from that um but you know that's how it was for me I mean what you describe doesn't sound unlike what like a blacksmith might do to like an apprentice thousands of years ago right or maybe hundreds of years ago uh where it's like I already showed you how to do this like almost kind of like a cartoon like if you ever seen the old Sam Remy SpiderMan movies The Cigar chomping boss with like the the buzz cut and he's sitting back in his he's like Parker I told you to do this this and this you know kind of like very um I guess uh he has very high standards for you and what you're going to get done right um very much trial by fire yeah and that Trial By Fire Man the the lawnmowing is really intensifying again I apologize uh if anybody hears like you know what sounds like a helicopter landing it's very faint okay good good good good uh thank you for reassuring me that uh as I'm very openly say like at free camp we don't do anything of these podcasts like this is unfiltered like unfolding in real time right uh and for me that's like exciting it's exciting that there are a bunch of men with hoodies and leaf blowers outside my window like playing a part in this recording so uh yeah it sounds like you learned a ton from that opportunity even though it was probably like um it was like a certain window of time when it was like the Wild West in programming and technology and there weren't there wasn't really the expectation maybe that somebody would have formally studied programming and computer science or they if they studied that they probably studied a bunch of Applied Mathematics they didn't study how to build websites and how to do do and a lot of this these Technologies were kind of being invented on the fly during that era um so you don't necessarily have comprehensive textbooks maybe you go to like a a Barnes & Noble or a borders and you get like did you ever get like the big fat books like um on different Technologies like yeah yeah like um I have quite a few that I actually need to donate because I don't read them yeah well um I mean do you remember that era like uh of just going into a big bookstore and just be like wow like so much knowledge all this knowledge is right here yeah I need to buy this book and then there was like a CD ROM in the back oh yeah of course yep in the classic sleeve yeah very cool well so it sounds like you learned a tremendous amount there and I I'm excited to learn a little bit more about what transpar because it sounds like you you were kind of going through the the proverbial uh learning process but you were doing it in a way that most people don't do it because most people uh nowadays in 2024 like just use freeo Camp to learn or they use some combination of courses like the courses you've developed uh or or you know video based courses or um they may use some books uh still to learn different Technologies like everybody learns a little bit different but to actually be in a shop with other devs kind of like almost kind of like I think of it as like um I mean I keep coming back to like a newsroom feel cuz it does feel like an editor just sending you out like giving you assignments and I worked in newspapers for a while and that was very much what it was like it was extremely hands off and you just like learned from your peers you learned from reading the New York Times every day and seeing what they were doing like like were you going to like CocaCola's website and like looking at their like interaction design and stuff like that and trying to learn from it or were you studying a lot of work that was out in you know in the wild to be honest I didn't because I was so overwhelmed with the work I had to do for my job during the day um and this is this is more like after I left that sort of temp job and was able to work at an advertising agency like that was like drinking from a fire hose in terms of I just had to like change this button on this landing page but like I knew that I had to get it done like in less than a day or a few hours because you know I need to meet my deadline so like it was I would say that the first three years the first one to two years were incredibly stressful because I constantly felt like I was going to fail and they were going to fire me for incompetence so it was a lot of Googling it was a lot of like looking up at stack Overflow trying to do as much research on my own before I actually asked one of the other developers because I was also very afraid of annoying the other Developers is if I bug them too much with questions so it was like I would say it was pretty difficult for me at that time but I was learning so much like I think my brain was just like expanding with the amount of things I would learn because like every day I would have to learn you know five five new things and then you multiply that by all the days in the year and like by the end of the first year I learned like so much just from having to do all these like innumerable little tasks yeah it was so yeah I didn't have free time to um try to build my skills because I was learning so much like on the job yeah interesting so like I mean would you just go home and be like exhausted like collapse in your bed like cuz learning is so hard and it's so tax like I spent a lot of my time learning and and not to make it about me again but like like there are days at the end of the day my brain is so tired I it's like mush because I spent the entire day like studying really hard on different topics and stuff like for me like the greatest feeling in the world the thing that I optimize and I build my life around obviously like rearing my kids and stuff like that and you know making a living and and you know running free camp but like in my free time I spend as much time as possible reading listening the podcast studying uh World languages of course shedding on the Bas woodshedding uh Charlie Parker famously goes to a Woodshed and just gets better by just practicing every day in the Woodshed and like like putting on records and learning from anyway sorry like go music tangent I'm obsessed with but um it sounds like your brain was kind of like expanding and you were probably I imagine again I don't want to talk too much about what was theoretically going on in your parid but I imagine like there were more wrinkles getting like you know formed in there and you were like did did you feel yourself becoming more powerful and more uh capable with every day was there a sense of full momentum I I think the first year was more just like living in complete compl abject fear of losing my job um so I think it it took I would say two years I think by the end of my second year at the agency I was like okay I think I'm like starting to feel less panic and more like I realize I'm still at the early stage of the learning curve but it doesn't feel as difficult and impossible as it did in the first year so it's a long time but like I think the 2year Mark was really where I was starting to feel a little bit more comfortable with and even if I didn't know an answer right away I knew that I had the tools to look up and figure out the solution and I think that when I hit that point I was like okay I like subjectively like or objectively I can do pretty much anything that someone asks me I just need to have enough time to like do the research and do trial and error so it was like up to that point it was very hard but after that point I knew I was still a beginner but I felt more confident in my own ability to research and gain you know the the knowledge I needed to you know do my job so one of the takeways I'm getting is like as much as you were learning a and gaining competency like it was not a fun experience cuz it it sounds like like uh imposter syndrome the clinical diagnosis that every developer gets when they're learning the code unless they learn the code when they're a little kid and they completely forget you know like all the the trial and error and stuff um um it sounds like that was completely casting a shadow over like all the enjoyment like so this was a rough year of your life it sounds like it was rough yeah and I think personally I also don't like feeling incompetent so I think that also made it even more difficult for me to not just be fearful and stressed the entire time so you know maybe other people if you're more comfortable you know not being not knowing everything then maybe it would be a little easier for you but I I think I just put a lot of pressure on myself and I think that definitely contributed to how hard that first year was um yeah I was I was very grumpy yeah I I mean like I guess that was like my one thing like Saving Grace when I was like trying to learn to code over this very lengthy process like looking like a total amateure on stage at these hackathons presenting you know having my code crash and or or just like there was this one time that I went out to a hackathon and like I couldn't actually get the project to work like the whole team was counting on me and we just showed a slideshow instead of showing a working prototype and that was like probably like the lowest point in my coding Journey just having let down my team uh but the one thing that like I think made it a little bit more bearable is I've always been kind of like I've never like thought I was a particularly smart or interesting or capable person I always kind of looked at myself as kind of like a uh just just not like a serious human being um and you know like Socrates like the the only thing I know is that I know nothing and I I always kind of like like you know Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure like the fact that they're like these happy golucky kind of fools uh just stumbling into like these very important matters and stuff like that like I always kind of like looked at myself that way and that cushioned kind of the impostor syndrome I'm like of course I'm an imposter like I'm not that smart of a guy you know so uh it sounds like you were holding yourself to a higher standard than I was and that might have been part of the reason for the misery yeah uh you did power through it right you stayed at this job for like seven years right at the at the agency M that's a long time to be at a first job but it's commendable cuz cuz like you know the saying like a rolling stone gathers no Moss you were gathering tons of moss just chilling there right and you want to get moss you want to get character very Moss right you want to be an organic you know uh because Rock by itself is not organic right maybe some types of rock are like sedimentary I don't know but um you know like you were building out like this character and this this Persona as a developer and and kind of coming into your own can you talk about those other six years at the agency once you'd kind of gotten through the first yeah kind of Hell year yeah so I would say so I think I also got promoted um twice in my time there and obviously like companies are completely relative you know everyone sort of has a different idea of like what senior means and all that stuff but I started out as um an assistant web developer so junior level and then I think after two years I got promoted to just web developer so like in the middle and then I think year four I got promoted to senior web developer um again this doesn't mean I could be a senior at like Google or Facebook or whatever but I think that sort of I was it shows that I was able to progress in my career and the agency felt like I was you know contributing more and more the longer that I was there um so yeah it definitely got easier um over time and I felt more confident and less stressed and I sort of like I had a lot of fun back in my agency days cuz you know we all were it's like working together on these incredibly tight timelines and St staying up late sometimes and stuff like that and I don't know if I would want to do that again and have to stay up till 300 a.m. deploying something to production because a client needs it live exactly at that moment in time but it was a fun time and I did feel like um because I was more confident in my skills I was Al also able to take on bigger sort of scopes of work so in the last I would say few years of my time at the agency instead of doing these sort of peac meal tasks like updating this button or you know whatever building this like One landing page I would take on sort of full website builds like from scratch so for example one of our clients was a bank and so I built their website both back and front end um so I built the I set up the CMS we used craft CMS which is a a c CMS and then I also did the front end so I did I worked from the design from the designer and I did all the CSS and all that so that was very satisfying to be able to reach that point where I could actually build a project from start to finish like completely on my own so I I enjoyed that work a lot yeah that's that's sounds like quite an evolution so very beginning you don't know how to do anything you're like struggling to like referencing your notebook over and over that your boss is giving you you're scared to ask questions probably because he's created a Culture of Fear around asking questions but uh yep but by the end you're you're you're like this kind of superhero that's just like sure I can do I can learn you know CP craft new CMS I never heard of uh CMS uh I can do the front end and I I'm like Soup To Nuts uh full stack Dev basically that's that's got to be still have a notebook I do have to say I I still I didn't have a physical notebook as much but it was more like I would keep track of notes like online that's actually how the blogging thing started cuzz I started a blog spot just to write down the notes so I could quickly um refer back to them based on the the tags and stuff so that's kind of how I started the developer blog thing notes for myself man that that is a blast from the past so uh I know right there was this Blogspot and blogger were they were the same right they were the same yeah the domain was blog spot but it was called blogger great branding yeah it's very not confuse anybody right so if you read this book uh it's called the founders at work great classic book that every startup founder has to written by Jessica Livingston uh YC you know board member why combinator board member there's this amazing interview with EV Williams uh where he was running blogger and he had to fire everybody they ran out of money at one point because he was such a bad you know developer like CEO I I no shade to him but he's not the greatest CEO on earth right as we've seen time and time again right so uh then he went on to found Twitter and medium and all these other uh websites but um yeah man like that is a harrowing tale that's by far the best interview in the book is the the tale of kind of ineptitude that led the vlogger almost being destroyed until Google swooped it and saved it the 11th hour but uh that's a that's a cool website so you started blogging on there just as a way to track your own learning like I just take and email them to myself and then I search them in Google right like they're personal but you were actually publicly you were learning in public as Sha Wang likes to say like you were learning in public before it was the thing to do uh you were kind of like one of the early adopters of just yeting your learnings out into the stratosphere yeah I mean I wasn't trying to build an audience or whatever this is kind of before everyone was trying to do that it was really just I wasn't expecting anyone to find my blog and I don't think anyone public ever really discovered it cuz like it was just these random notes on like SQL and c and CSS and stuff yeah but it got the uh kind of like technical writing creative Creator engine going right like the the Jessica Chan the coder coder that we know today is ultimately a consequence of you sharing your learning online right yeah for sure and I think yeah looking back I think that notes blog did help me sort of eventually choose the Cod or coder Direction yeah so you're working at this agency you've been there for six years um at what point did you start like seriously taking or taking seriously the notion that like hey I could create tutorials on YouTube or I could write blog posts that actually help people like actually having an audience in mind rather than just yourself as your future self as the audience yeah um so I would have to say this whole time as I'd mentioned like I just enjoyed setting up blogs just for fun I also had this kind of like maybe entrepreneurial interest even from when I was a young kid like I remember when I was young I made this like vending machine out of a shoe box and I tried to sell it to my siblings and like I would just put like random candy and like peanuts in it and trying to make money off of them so I feel like I always was interested in not necessarily like making a lot of money and getting rich but again kind of creating this entity that worked in terms of operating as a business and letting me be autonomous which is a huge sort of core desire of my of mine like I really like the idea of kind of being independent and not having to be dependent on say a company or whatever um for my livelihood so I think you know when when you're working at a company I think there's good and there's bad and I think I saw both of those um in my time at the agency we had I think maybe one or two layoffs and those are incredibly demoralizing for the people who are laid off obviously but also the people who are left and it kind of really hits home that the company's not there to like help you like the company's there to exist as its own and you are it's kind of being built on the backs of the people working there every day so I think maybe with a little bit of um disillusionment I would say with the you know the whole like getting a corporate job and they'll take care of you and give you benefits y y which was very good um but I think and that may have been how it was back in the day when there was like zero competition like nobody went to college and uh you know if you served in the war that was probably good enough for you to be up to be like an executive and an advertising agency if you seen Mad Men like they always make fun of the college kids cuz they went to war when the college kids just went and like lived these yepy Lifestyles and stuff uh but but like things used to be a lot less competitive people would just drink martinis all day and like it was uh you know I mean like things have gotten so incredibly intensely competitive over the last 30 or 40 years and I I don't think cut old folks understand frankly there's like a like a lack of empathy from like you know a lot of older folks I don't want to say all older folks there are definitely you know people from previous you know like people in their 70s and ' 80s that do understand how hard young people have it but it has gotten so intensely competitive that uh any kind of like social contract between an employer and an employee that may used to exist when you were like a you know an IBM man or something like that right that is long gone right like there's nobody that can't be fired basically unless you're Mark Zuckerberg and you have like Ironclad control of like the the preferred chairs and you nobody can fire you like he can't get fired right Travis K in theory couldn't have been fired from Uber he he also had like super majority like shares and stuff he ultimately stepped down because there was just so much pressure on him if you watch super pumped on Netflix great show about entrepreneurialism not uh not safe for kids um to check it out it's great show I I've talked about it before and I I do recommend super pumped uh with perhaps one of my favorite actors uh today uh Joseph Gordon Levitz he does a great job representing Travis K the the most mocky valant business figure of our time but what I'm just trying to get to is like like anybody who says like we're a family you know blah like you know like run the other way if your employer doesn't accept that there is you know like you're a mercenary essentially uh and you can really like working at the job but at the same time just know that um you know companies ultimately have to respond to incentives from you know investors and other people like that and like you're just one of many people they don't like laying people off I don't think anybody enjoys let letting people go but as you saw twice just on the front lines your your colleagues getting let go like that that happens and um yeah that was that one of the reasons why you like ultimately wanted to get out of the proverbial Rat Race and like become independent I think eventually but I think I I also had sort of discovered the whole like idea of blogging as like a income Source um I think you know this is back in the I would say maybe 2010s or so this is when blogging was like really I would say at its peak with like you could you could make money off of like affiliate links and all this kind of stuff and so I think I since I loved blogging I was like oh this could be something that I could do and I think I was kind of searching for a way that I could make money on my own without having to be dependent on a company and I'd read this book called um the $100 startup by Chris Gilbo um and I remember this is this is how coder coder started so like I was on a flight to Japan to visit my friend and I was reading this startup book on the plane and Chris Gilbo asks you like okay to figure out what business idea you can come up with like what are you passionate about and what can you know you what can you do to help other people and so for me I was like oh I would say I'm passionate about coding I really enjoy building websites and I think it's a skill that I could you know share with other people and help them to basically do what I did because you know coding took me from working these temporary office gigs to having like a very stable like wellpaying career and so I felt like that moment of realization of like oh I should do this like I want to do this and so that's kind of how I started like getting more serious about writing coding tutorials on my blog and then I also got into Instagram I found out there was like a whole develop our community on Instagram which was like really cool because um in my job like my coworkers were great but like I only had worked with like male coworkers like there were no other women um like at my job the entire time that I worked there so seeing on Instagram that there were like you know other people doing web development who you know looked more like me was like a really cool sense of community and so I kind of like fell into like those sort of areas in terms of like online you know webd type of stuff um so yeah that's how coder coder started yeah um yeah yeah that that's really cool so I mean you brought up an important point about the fact that like the field was very maledominated um at the time and uh so just just to finish kind of like the the origin story um and establish our chronology we're going to be drawing from for the rest of the conversation so you you did leave this job at the um at the agency and was that to ultimately go into freelancing yourself um yeah so I left the agency because I was trying to do freelance and sort of build up like the coder coder thing so I did end up freelancing for the agency for a little bit after even after I left um but I think it was just nice to yeah have less of the sort of expectations and everything um but yeah so I did freelance for I would say a long time maybe like three or four years um and then I I did freelancing for like other like another company as well before I quit that a couple years ago so you were able to kind of like taper off having people go out and find clients for you essentially that's what like an agency does it it kind of like puts Under One Roof like both the sales side and the actual like I guess production side uh that's probably an oversimplification I've never worked at an agency uh I have people that swear by working at agencies that love agency life like Cass Marino CSS artist whom you can watch an interview with here on the fre C Camp uh YouTube channel or on the uh that listen you can listen on the free C Camp podcast she's amazing uh but uh I'm really interested in kind of like how you tapered that off and how you went out and got your own clients because that is something that a lot of people listening to this would like to ultimately freelance and have their own kind of consultancy yeah um I mean to be honest I never was like having to find my own clients because my clients were companies if that makes sense so like my first client was obviously my old agency and then um just through knowing coworkers who moved on to other companies like they were hiring Freelancers as well so I was doing freelance jobs for like their new companies and stuff like that um so I never did the the whole like you know local like try to find you know local businesses to to build up your clientele but I do know that's very possible that's such an interesting departure from what a lot of the other people who do fre so essentially you built like this network from working in an agency for so long uh that you already had like kind of all the connective tissue you needed to be able to just continue to Coast on those relationships yeah yeah for sure I think I had a very very yeah I'm very fortunate that I benefited from my my networking um back then and yeah just able to find different freelance gigs um yeah yeah and the entire time you're blogging and as you said in the early 2010s blogging was at its Heyday you could slap AdSense on a blog or potentially get like sponsorships or do other things like that and you could actually make real money blogging now can you make real money blogging well I am going to tell you how much money free Cod camps publication Mi right we do uh millions of page views a month uh on that and we just have like Google AdSense running and I think we make like maybe like 10 or 15K a month from like the ads the show on there it's not a lot of money when you consider like the entire staff millions of and yeah like like we have an editorial team uh we we have a a ton of volunteer contributors who write their excellent tutorials and publish up there I published my entire book if you Google learn the code book it's free it's all on freecodecamp.org newsnews that's our publication um and we published tons of tutorials there every week we probably publish like 20 tutorials a week and including a lot of full length books and handbooks we've got more than 100 books through freeo Camp press which is really just us publishing through our CMS but uh yeah like there's no way that I was like an individual author trying to live off AdSense that I'd be able to right we've got like all this momentum from SEO and like just being around and like having reputation and all everything we do free Cod Camp kind of like feeds into like people knowing that free Cod Camp exists I wear the free Cod camp shirt literally everywhere I go you know it's like FR I've got like 10 of these and I just wear them every day um it's my uniform I got to be a billboard for for this charity right uh so so you know 15K I don't imagine you were making even close to 15K off just ad ad Revenue but like maybe you could talk about how you were able to gradually become more of a content creator and less of a uh freelancer yeah so I think it grew I would say pretty slowly so like initially I had the blog and I don't know if I even put ads on the blog initially I think the only way I was making money was Amazon affiliate links um and it was doing like it was doing okay but it wasn't like I mean when you say okay if you wouldn't mind giving like could you could you tell us um if I can remember I would would say maybe like I would say $200 a month would be pretty good oh wow okay so so that's from Amazon affiliate links like yeah and now if you try to do Amazon affiliate links I think I've heard it's a lot less like they really don't care about the affiliate Market yeah yeah so I think that the the the landscape in terms of online like moneymaking has definitely changed you cannot you cannot live off of ads and affiliate links alone you you need other you need other Diversified channels of income for sure yeah yeah so um what were your what was your like I guess Revenue stack if you will like how were you able to like uh to make it work yeah so I think things changed a lot when I decided to go into YouTube um and not just writing text tutorials but like you know doing these screencasts and other things and so that started probably it was had like like stops and starts so I think the first YouTube video was uploaded in like 2017 and then I didn't upload another video for like a year or two years um but I did eventually start being more consistent about uploading videos and things started taking off in 2020 like I think when the pandemic hit everyone was just like online 24/7 so like back then there were a lot of people watching YouTube videos so that was kind of when my channel started growing a lot and I was able to make money off of AdSense I think maybe since then maybe the max that I would do was like 1,500 a month from just AdSense which was pretty good um and then I also had some affiliate links and that was bringing in about the same per month um but okay so so you're making about $33,000 a month just as a Creator and you're still doing Consulting work at this point or were you I was doing freelancing um and then at some point I was like I think when I hit that three 3K a month Mark I was like all right let's like just try to do coder coder and not do freelance anymore so I stopped doing freelance I would say maybe 20 22 just like just like a couple years ago yeah and to put this in context like for a lot of people listening to this they may be single or uh not like Mar or you know maybe in a situation where they they are not able to get health insurance your your husband uh is an accomplished animator uh if you wouldn't talk if you wouldn't mind talking a little bit about him and like the role he played in you being able to make this transition cuz my wife was absolutely instrumental and me being able to make the trans transition she was working you know in Tech doing accounting and we had health insurance she wasn't making just a ton of money cuz she was she wasn't a developer she was like doing accounting and stuff and which is like half a quarter of 10th of what developers make but uh but that insurance was very helpful and also the fact that we just had like a consistent Baseline like the rent was basically covered just from her income and stuff uh so that gave me the flexibility to take more risks if I were a single person uh and I didn't have like and I also had like a lot of savings and I've famously plowed like $150,000 of my own Savings in a free Cod camp and that was money that like I earned over like 10 years working as a teacher basically like you can imagine what a teacher I basically saved half of everything I I earned and I also like hustled back in the day like you hear about this all the time and I'm not sure if you can even make money on it anymore but I I would like buy tons of old like video games and stuff that like Collectibles things like that on Craigslist go to like you know buy Big Lots of these things and then I break them down and sell them kind of piece them out on eBay and sell them that way and that so that's how I like the the small fortune you know $150,000 that I used to fund develop like the first few years of free Camp before we got our tax income status but the entire time of course we also had my wife's income so it just uh so so I always like to point out like your situation your circumstances are going to be different from mine and Jessica so just factor that in your mileage May VAR and also factor that in when you hear these getrich quick schemer type people or like these like oh like the you know the hustle culture Bros and people like that right like you know there is risk in trying to become a Creator there is risk in trying to become a freelancer there's risk in taking time off to like learn to code in hopes of getting a developer job and uh I think people are remiss when they don't acknowledge that risk but anyway sorry with that sidebar your husband um yeah so my husband actually is also a freelancer so unfortunately we are paying um out of pocket for Private health insurance and it's like very expensive um I think I remember I had a friend who was talking to who lives in Canada and I was talking about how we have to pay for our own health insurance he's like oh like how much is it I was like you know it's like $1,000 a month for like two people and she was like what because like she was and she was like I'm complaining about spending $50 a month on my Canadian health insurance so like that was just like a huge like I think eye opening moment for yeah yeah so it's it's very expensive in America to pay for insurance yourself um but we I think we make it work because we do have savings and we also live in kind of a lower um cost of what's it called cost of living lower cost of living part of the country so that helps too um cuz you know if you want to live in like LA or New York or you know wherever it's like I think there's definitely obviously benefits to that and there's a reason why so many people want to live there but you know I remember reading about um Chris coyer from CSS tricks and finding out that he lives like up in Wisconsin or something and I think that was for me at least the realization of like oh you can like still have a really big online presence and be a part of you know the whole Community but you don't have to live in like these bigname cities so yeah I think that yeah a lot of those those Heavies as I like to call them in the teaching space you know Chris Kyer of course uh great dude whom we hope to have uh on the podcast at some point uh yes West boss Scott stalinsky uh like a lot of the kind of like the I guess the people that preceded me uh like like whom I looked up to and learned from very early on and probably you and like a lot of other people also look up to and learned from them they live out in the middle of nowhere and and like yeah and so you don't have to live in SF it absolutely helps and I did live in SF during the early first few years um free cooking SF San Francisco I moved out there because that's the tech Mecca and for me it wasn't that big a deal because I was already living in like Southern California so I just went up there and slept on my friend's couch uh for a few months and then I eventually was able my wife was able to transfer within her company up there and we were able to make it work inff but we we're living in a a one bedroom shoe box it's like 600 square F feet and we were paying like a ton of money to live there and so you know it's definitely for me it was a phase it was like a stage if you look at like a rocket you know how there's like the booster stage that was the booster stage and now like we're a little higher up you know we don't need as much fuel to like keep keep ascending or something like that I don't know it's a weird analogy but it sounds like you and your husband and and by the way I also get like Obamacare like I pay from the private Market as well and like most people I know do unless they're at like some big company that has like fancy health insurance and if you're getting health insurance you're paying for it some way right like you're probably getting a lower you know uh compensation in some other form because that benefit employees are sophisticated they look at you as the total cost of having this person fill this cubicle seat right um they're they're not unsophisticated and they're not Charities right like free COC is literally a charity but its purpose is not to be charitable to the people that work at free c yeah it's to be to serve a charitable purpose which our our mission our charitable tax exam purpose from the IRS to create free learning resources like this podcast you're watching right now and uh I'll just while I'm ranting about freeo I'll just say you can become one of the 9 million plus 9 million sorry I wish it was 9 million 9,000 plus I think it's like 9,000 and3 we just crossed 9,000 uh recently people who support free C Camp each month with a small donation of like $5 a month or something like that you go to freec camp.org donate you make all this possible the the courses the Interactive Learning platform the text based tutorials the books uh everything so um shout out to all those those kind folks and if you're watching uh thank you um or if you're listening I always listen to the audio version I don't actually watch the video version but like we have a lot of people that watch the video so they get to look at like the cool video I put on in the background so that people don't just have to look at my face for two hours they can look at like a trct mode of some old Japanese arcade game from the 80s okay so back to uh like just daytoday living as a freelancer so your husband is no stranger at a freelancer life he is doing animation his animation is amazing I don't know if he also does the sound design but like just like the the candy anything yeah yeah and and like so again I'm going to link to uh that one video about your coding Journey uh which what we just talked about at length over the last hour you can like learn all that in six minutes with really cool Pokemon kind of Earthbound looking uh animations and stuff um by the way I was like watching that video I was like uh I hadn't seen it in like four years since you first published it and last night I watched it um and I also I showed it to my kids um back in the day but like I I left this really lengthy comment on on YouTube like anybody who leaves comments on YouTube if you ever feel like man YouTube just like did anybody even see my comment I don't think anybody saw this comment you saw it you like put like the heart thing which you can do if you're the creator of the video but like it had one thumbs up and that was probably you I like spent probably like 5 minutes like you know coming with this really compliment I think Brad traversy who runs uh you know uh traversy media he's jumped in he's like great video and it had like 2,000 upvotes and like so I I genuinely believe that YouTube is like heavily biased on toward people who leave comments within the first few minutes those are the ones that people are going to like and it those are the comments that are going to rise to the top so if anybody ever leaves a video and you feel neglected or if you ever leave a comment on a video and you feel neglected know that I'm right there with you and that I feel robbed by YouTube's comment algorithm I spent so much time coming up like 5 minutes of My Life coming up with that comment and nobody saw it yeah anyway definitely heavily weighted toward the early early stuff yeah so uh so you've got approximately uh $3,000 a month uh in income uh and you're paying a th000 of that just to uh private insurance and stuff like that but like where do you go from there and how do you build out this coder coder brand uh and this kind of like High touch polished like fancy animation like really high energy uh I mean it's almost like you're definitely the highest production Creator in the uh tutorial space in my humble opinion oh unless missing like I don't know anybody that like puts as much thought and deliberation into every minute of a video as you do yeah I mean there's there's definitely a lot of really great creators in the space like fire ship and um there's like some new channel that are pretty pretty good like hyperplex a lot of Animation Stu but yeah thank you you're you're very kind I will pass on the the compliments to my husband um yeah so sorry the question is like how do I yeah like how do things unfold from there like like what what are some of the main things you've learned creating these video tutorials I would actually say that yes I acknowledge I have a very unfair advantage in terms of being married to an incredibly talented animator and editor um but I would actually say that you can't rely you can't just Coast on like the sizzle you do need to have like content so I think I would actually say that one of the main maybe benefits of my videos that I really try to go in depth in the tutorials so like I spend a lot of time when I'm writing scripts for the videos one writing a script because I'm terrible ad living I've gotten better over time but um I like writing everything out and I do a lot of research on like I read like the um Mozilla developer Network a lot I also read the actual like um what is it the the HTML spec from the the W3 and that is like bedtime reading it's like incredibly dense and hard to pick out the meaning but you know I do it when I have to so I would say that like I try really hard to do a lot of depth research but also present that indepth information in a way that is accessible to people who are not you know experts in the field because I think that's really important to be able to talk to people at the level that they're at and sort of guide them through their own Learning Journey so that's I would say that's the most important thing that I try to do in all my videos so research and preparation so by the time you like turn on the camera or turn on the mics you've already spent a great deal of time thinking about the topic that you're going to talk about and uh yeah and and it shows it comes through in your videos that you're like pretty authoritative and and you're pretty definitive um and and also it's just like really compressed like you said Fire Ship is famous for having like these three minute videos that are funny and just like overload of memes and stuff like that um and like like C in three minutes or something like that right like those kinds of videos those are cool those those are fun uh and then you have like the polar opposite where these long winding conversations between two people who have done stuff you know over here on the freeo camp podcast right so um zero production value just just Personality yeah so good content yeah exactly and like again I listen to so many pocket people like I I interviewed Scott uh sininsky not Scott Selinsky uh Scott the other Pro Scott Hanselman yes he like how do you do it like who listen list to this stuff like who has time to listen to but I listen to this stuff all the time I learned so much for like long interviews um and I feel like they they surface a whole lot of you know interesting stuff that wouldn't come out in like a polished like if you were to go on Good Morning America which uh you know is like like you're lucky if they take like three sentences of what you say and put it on there right so for sure I I have so many questions for you we haven't even gotten to them and I'm just going to start firing them off sure right uh so you worked seven years at your first job would you recommend people stay at their first job for seven years I think if it works for you I think if I stayed as long as I did because I felt like I was constantly learning and like I didn't plateau and I felt like it was a reasonably not toxic environment for the most part and so I think it really depends on the situation but I do think that it can be a benefit to start at one company and kind of you know work your way up and get experience there um yeah varies you yeah absolutely you have a really cool like background like area it looks like you got a nice bookshelf you may actually have the same it's not the same bookshelf it's a similar bookshelf I got it on like Wayfair but but like you've got like a cool kind of like setup over there and like I imagine you know you're into like mechanical keyboards and stuff like that uh like just like the Aesthetics of getting work done mhm especially as like an more artist artistic minded person who who is like studyed photography and probably like you know you know Mary condo cell like looks thinks about like all the different little details and stuff right I try so maybe you could talk about your setup and like how you get in your happy place for getting work done oh yeah that's a big question um I'm going to be completely honest here so I've worked remotely for the past seven years um some of it was at the agency where I actually worked remotely and started out working in the physical office but motivation has been a huge like I cannot overestimate how much of a struggle staying motivated has been um working remotely and then also just like working for myself essentially um I'm still like figuring it out but like I I'm very embarrassed about like the thought of what I do with my day um like you've seen those videos where it's like you know day in the life of a programmer and like you see all the things that they do it's like everyone's like waking up at 600 a. and stuff it's like I do not wake up at 600 a.m. my sleep schedules can very swing widely um and I'm definitely not like sit down the desk for eight hours and like type away so it's like it's been a pretty big struggle if I'm honest and I think you know the whole pandemic was part of that too I think um yeah yeah just made things hard but I'm hopefully getting better at motivating myself but it's yeah it's hard man especially when you're just at home all the time yeah when you have to turn it on when you're like man I got this deadline like or I committed to this goal of mine maybe nobody else uh knows about it but you like want to hold yourself accountable like how do you fire yourself up to to get things done do you have any sort of ritual or some sort of like fallback some sort of song that you put on that like you know the rocky them like something that you do to like to to get on point for me um yeah I'm still figuring that part out but I will say there's this guy on YouTube called struthless he's a tattoo artist but he makes really cool videos on a lot of them are like productivity and motivation and stuff like that and just like artistic stuff and he had this whole video on motivation and he named something called the dark why so it's this idea that when we think about motivation we want to think like oh like I'm you know it's like all good it's all like positive stuff but in reality people are really motivated by either getting away from or proving something wrong or like avoiding these like bad things that we don't want to happen and I think that that is true for me for sure so for example I've been working on this course for like I don't know how how many years now it's been again a big struggle but I think um when I had a early access launch back in November um last year that was my like drop dead deadline where it's like this has to be done before that point otherwise I've already said it publicly what the launch date is I'm going to like hugely embarrass myself and also disappoint myself if I don't make that deadline so once I had that external deadline that really like lit a fire under my butt and got me to just like the finish line so I think I think a lot of it is just figuring out how you operate and what things actually can motivate you um but yeah also not to sound cliche but I think not letting myself scroll on Reddit all the time helped a lot so just kind of like limiting that social media phone time I think helps helps your brain yeah 100% I will second that uh I um I don't spend any time on Reddit uh in fact Reddit timed me out as a mod for my own subreddit oh no R free Coke camp like I in like inactive status it's this badge and I'm the I'm the mod like I created the free C Camp subred right and they won't let me like add Naomi from our team as a as a mom because I'm inactive so I have to post on Reddit and like you see me posting on Reddit just say hey great job like I mean it I am impressed by the project he just submitted but like I'm also trying to get reddit's algorithm to uh to say like okay he's he's active again he can add new me as a mod now so uh but but yeah like that like the amount of time I spent on social media is like vanishingly small and it used to be this huge good part like I've I've definitely mellowed out not spending time there um yeah not that it's not incredibly useful yeah but but yeah you've worked for yourself for a long time like have how do you sort of stay motivated because it feels like you're working on like 20 different amazing things at the same time well thank you uh I'm I'm glad it looks good from the outside because every organization from the inside like every person's life I think feels like it's probably a mess because you have access to all the gritty details um but I mean like like one of our guests um Phoebe vong Fidel um she talked about how like having kids was like the biggest productivity Boon in her life cuz suddenly she had to be accountable of the kid and it took up so much of her time that she had to figure out how to like structure the rest of her time so that she could be as productive as she was before she had kids and that's a that's a great interview recommend everybody check it out um but but like you know she learned like you she learned a code at like 36 or something right and uh it it was having that extrinsic pressure of like I've got this kid that's constantly crying and I need to get things done in between dealing with this kid and like I I would say like the first few years of free COC I was just pure ID I don't know what to say but but it's was just like like I really don't like forprofit education I don't like student debt I don't like like it it was kind of like a rage that was driving me and it's a dark why yeah my dark why I like I am so upset that we're in the most prosperous country in the world and that there's suffering that there's homelessness that there are uh people who don't have access to opportunity just because of where they were born if they were born in like Appalachia or you know uh Middle America like where I was where I grew up and there just was an expectation that like you'd be a construction worker when you grew up or something like that right like uh I definitely that was what fired me up initially was just like wanting to destroy the forprofit education complex and make education free like I and I still feel that way but I've mellowed out a lot and a lot of my productivity is not based on emotion it's based on like okay like I've got systems that keep me accountable like I wake up at 700 a.m. every day because I've got kids and they're like roosters and they jump out of bed at 700 a.m. full energy and you're up when they're up right there's no sleeping through kids jumping on your bed and like uh you know stealing your phone and watching like Zelda videos at full blast and stuff like that um yeah so so like that that is kind of and and then just like all the normal diet exercise like if you live in one place for long enough uh and you you establish some routines you you can kind of Coast on those routines uh like you know like like today I woke up took my kids to school uh I went to the YMCA I exercised I walked home entire time I was thinking about this interview and like preparing and I I did my research I had like three pages of notes I was you know questions I was going to ask it's just a bunch of prep uh and then that prep carries you you know sorry for that little like weird inhale thing um I'm not going to edit it out because I don't edit okay keep um yeah uh I I feel like people need a source of like real human beings on the internet who are not fronting and Max you know who were just being themselves and uh not trying to impress people I'm not trying to impress anybody I'm trying to teach people and you know potentially Enlighten them about the nature of reality it's not these perfect human beings it's not like James Bond not getting killed the first time he goes on a mission because he's a ostentatious bastard you know he be the worst spy the real spies you never even hear about right so anyway true so um I want to draw some more insight out of you because you just have some and and I also want to be mindful of your time uh so uh we have like 13 minutes I'm just going to start firing away all right you're very you're very vocal about uh how how you look things up all the time like this is a huge part of your message to developers it's like developers are not omniscient they don't have like Tic memories where they've just committed the mdn to their brain right you're constantly looking things up and can you talk about that and like how you did you ever did you feel weird about that when you were like aren't developers supposed to be smart and just know this stuff yeah I mean I think I was lucky that I when I was starting out in my career like I had other developers around me and I think it was it seemed pretty accepted that everyone looked up stuff all the time so I think that at least I didn't have any sort of like you know false impressions of what a real real developer does but I noticed that when I started putting out some videos I think early on I did these live coding um live streams actually on my channel and I would try to build a website from a design which is my whole shtick I guess and I would spend a lot of time looking things up on stack Overflow or reading the docs and I used to remember getting all these comments from people being like Oh my gosh like real developers like do lookup stuff and so I think that really like sort of stuck with me that if you're just learning how to code on your own and you don't have any knowledge about the industry like it's very easy to think like oh these people on YouTube or professionals working at companies like they don't have to look anything up like everything is just like living in their brain 247 and it's just like a library up there but that's really not true because there's just so much knowledge there's so many areas in programming and web development and also things are changing all the time especially now nowadays um yeah things just change so quickly so you have to that's just part of the routine so I think it's really important for me to like keep it real and just like show people people like real web developers like look up stuff all the time yeah and it's not going to get any better like like it's always going to be like that because by definition the field is like people operating at the frontier of what the tools are capable of if the tool abstracted something away then you wouldn't need to do that anymore so you're always going to be working with like higher and higher levels of abstraction probably unless you have like really crazy constraints like we need this chip to work on this satellite and it needs to work for 2,000 years or something like that right yeah so um Okay so you know those kind of edge cases aside like you're going to be using lots of tools you're going to be using the raw compute power and like all the other stuff that gets better every year what kind of uh when you were developing uh websites and apps as a consultant what were kind of your bread and butter types of elements and things that you just build over and over again H that's a really good question um I think like the whole like card UI where it's like you have different cards with like photos and like things like that and I think just when I was learning it there was no flex box initially so you had to like lay out things with CSS float which was kind of a nightmare um but yeah I think just like getting good at these sort of multi column layouts that stack to one column on mobile like that was I would say 90% of my job um working in advertising and marketing yeah were there any UI kind of dark patterns that you're like I'm I refuse to do this I mean I mean personally I think carousels are just a huge waste of time and they don't work because no one never clicks to the second slide in the carousel but carousels basically exist so that you can tell the marketing higher ups that the content they wanted to put on the homepage is on the homepage it's just on slide seven um so I I consider Carousel is a little bit of a pattern that I would not I don't think anything that's like an anti pattern but like a dark pattern like something that you think is like manipulative of users or maybe something that where there's like an ethical gray area oh like Adobe unsubscribing yeah or LinkedIn the the the uh master of dark patterns like hey would you like to tell your friends that that oh your friend's not LinkedIn would you like to like import your inbox and every single person you've ever like emailed and like send them an email say hey why aren't you on LinkedIn they did that like five times like they said they do it once and even the way they asked it was really sketchy anyway I don't want to hammer L too much but they they did so many sketch things to uh to build that out initially but but but you said AI uh Adobe like unsubscribe but are there any dark patterns that uh you you've like felt really bad about like implementing just because your boss told you to implement or is there anything that like an ethical line that you'll never cross again yeah I mean I was fortunate that I think I didn't have I was never asked to do something that I felt ethically like questionable about um but yeah I think anything that like leverages is like your real life information or personal information I think you know for social credit or whatever on the app is like something that I think I would never I would never want to do that um yeah anything that that tries to get you to import your entire like contact list from your phone to the and give all your personal data to the app is like I think pretty bad yeah 100% agreed um so in terms of like gradually you're somebody who focuses on expanding their skills all the time in terms of strategies you've used to like learn things like what is something that if if somebody wanted to learn an entire new area like let's say they're a front end developer and they want to learn backend so they can do full stack development like are there any particular strategies or advice that you would give to somebody that wanted to absorb an entire new you know Corpus of knowledge yeah I think if I was trying to to learn something new in programming I think I would definitely go to YouTube first I would go to YouTube and see what videos are kind of the most popular for for example a search term for like you know xyz4 beginners um I think I'd also probably I would probably check out Reddit I think Reddit is a good source of like real information from like real people usually especially for like learning I think it's really good um because there's always going to be someone posting like I want to learn this and that like how do I get started and then people who are more ahead of you have like good recommendations I feel like um yeah so I think just I think learning how to just figure learning how to identify what a good resource is versus a not good resource I think is kind of important um yeah are there any like telltale signs uh what is going to be like my biggest concern is not necessarily the quality of the resource but like how much of the resource you're going to get before they slim a pay wall your face and like oh I just spent like half an hour learning this tutorial and suddenly like I can't Advance any further you know like pay walls are really annoying I understand that that you know code academy and websites like that have to keep the lights on uh but uh it's all like sometimes I wonder if they're not sufficiently forthcoming about what the course actually includes for free before you have to start like you know inputting your credit card but sure are there any um just just to re rephrase my questions this is a Meandering thing um are there are there any like telltale signs of like hey this is going to be too superficial like I shouldn't cuz you can watch the same you know C in 3 minutes not to pick on because he does it inest Fire Ship does like ingest how C Works in three minutes there's not an expectation you're learn CP in 3 minutes but like you can watch the same like HTML explained for forgetters like 30 minute tutorial like you can watch 20 of those and you wouldn't really be any better than if you just watched one or two of them right like uh how do you identify a a good resource um I personally I sort of look at the tone of how the information is conveyed so if someone starts the video like how to learn HTML and they're like what's up like I'm here to show you and it it feels a little bit too like um there's like a certain energy that like sort of makes me naturally distrust the person but so I feel like and this is again just maybe my own personal preferences but if I feel like the person teaching me something seems like they are more like serious or more it seems like they've really put time into explaining things well I think that's a good sign I think also you can look at a channel and this is just for YouTube resources but you know for example Kevin pal all his videos are about CSS they are incredibly in depth and I think people kind of recognize that over time um and they and he explains things really well and so I think that looking at sort of their body of work on their Channel and seeing how you know either shallow or how indepth they go on the topics I think if you do a little bit of research and just kind of yeah see for yourself like how the teaching kind of sounds so I think yeah whether they're talking authoritatively or it looks like they're reading a script that was probably generated by gbt or something right yeah yeah uh and Kevin Powell the king of CSS he does not like it when I call him that but that is like the the moniker that he has uh he's given by the community yes uh last question what are some biggest what do you think the biggest misconceptions uh people have about learning the code when they're just watching a bunch of YouTube videos like what are some misconceptions that you want to just shoot down real quick to like reassure people no that's that's not how it really is I would say um you don't have to be on The Cutting Edge this might be an unpopular opinion but it is my opinion I don't operate on The Cutting Edge and I don't think you need to excuse me um I think like especially when it comes to content creators in programming like you're trying to make a video that gets views so people will always make videos on like the next you know new hottest technology out there or newest framework or whatever but the reality is a lot of companies are using jQuery or they're using Wordpress or you know they're not using like the newest CSS feature that's not like um supported by like the majority of browsers so I would say don't worry about learning the newest hottest thing right now I would say just stick to the basics especially if you're at the beginning of your Learning Journey and you can always learn newer things like later on CU if you learn the new things now they may or may not be hit the mainstream and then you'll have in some ways maybe wasted some time that you could have spent just kind of focusing on the basics so that's my biggest piece of advice yeah 100% that's a great note to end on Jessica it's been such a blast learning more about you learning from you I've got like 160 lines of notes in my uh editor here I've learned a tremendous amount and uh it's just such an amazing blessing to have you in the developer Community creating tutorials focusing on delivering substance for the people right and and uh you know we're all excited about your your big course that you you're working on best of luck continuing progress on that and again I just want to emphasize like over the years you've contributed so many tutorials to the Freo Camp uh text based like publication got some video courses from you like I am always really really hyped up and really jazzed whenever Bo mentions oh yeah I heard from Jessica you know so so like thank you for everything you're doing for the community yeah hopefully I can do more once this course is done with but yeah yeah love the free code Camp Community absolutely well thanks again for just providing like a really cool like I guess model of someone who has gone out and uh blazed their own path and who has transitioned from working in a field that like basically just cratered um I mean you talk about like having to go work as a temp with a college degree it's it's not a position that I did that too I worked uh doing like their temp agencies in Oklahoma City and I did that that whole thing for for a few years and it was miserable uh but but being able to find a way out of that being able to build up a skill set being able to you know do have a choice whether you want to do freelance work or for or continue to work for previous employers or work for your your friends new employers and stuff like that or um just continue to create content on your own like having that level of agency that level of security that that uh being being the master of your own destiny I think it's incredibly inspiring and I love how you don't sugarcoat any of this and you don't seem to take any of this for granted you're out there getting things done and you're working just as hard as you were before so uh it's a huge source of inspiration for me awesome yeah thanks so much for having me on yeah well everybody until next week happy coding
