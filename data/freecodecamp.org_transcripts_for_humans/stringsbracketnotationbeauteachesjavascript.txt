00:00 - bracket notation is a way to get a
00:01 - character that's at a specific index
00:03 - within a string javascript doesn't start
00:06 - counting at one like humans do
00:08 - it starts at zero this is referred to as
00:11 - zero based indexing here we've assigned
00:14 - the first name variable to the string bo
00:16 - so with this string you can get the
00:18 - value of the first letter of the string
00:20 - by using
00:22 - so if we run that we see b in the
00:25 - console so we have the first name
00:26 - variable and then we use these brackets
00:29 - and inside the brackets we put the index
00:32 - so index zero is b because we start
00:36 - counting at zero but we can also change
00:38 - this to one
00:40 - and then you'll see in the console we
00:41 - have e because e is index one a is index
00:45 - two and u is index three and if you
00:47 - wanna get the last character of a string
00:49 - you can just subtract one from the
00:51 - string's length like this instead of
00:53 - putting one in here i'm gonna paste in
00:56 - dot length minus one so then you just
00:59 - automatically get the last character in
01:01 - the string which is in this case is u
01:03 - you can also get any other character
01:05 - from the end so if you want to get the
01:07 - second to last character you just do
01:09 - minus two and then we're gonna get a you
01:11 - can also get the third to last character
01:13 - the fourth to last character you just do
01:14 - the string.length and then minus how
01:16 - many characters you want to go back from
01:18 - in javascript string values are
01:20 - immutable which means that they cannot
01:21 - be altered once created so if i want to
01:24 - try to
01:24 - set the character in index 0 to q
01:28 - well you can't do that you cannot change
01:30 - individual characters in a string
01:32 - because the strings are immutable but i
01:35 - can set the first name variable to a
01:36 - whole new string
01:41 - so you can see here i've set the first
01:43 - name variable to quincy and i've logged
01:45 - this this new string here but we did not
01:47 - technically alter
01:49 - the string bow up here we just set the
01:52 - variable to an entirely new string well
