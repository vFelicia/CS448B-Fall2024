00:00 - hey everybody welcome back to css3 in 30
00:03 - days today is day number 12 and we are
00:06 - going to be playing around with
00:07 - something called css variables there's
00:10 - also you can call it custom properties
00:13 - uh but that's not as exciting css
00:16 - variables especially for uh developers
00:19 - and designers out there who are familiar
00:21 - with variables in languages like php or
00:24 - jquery
00:25 - or even using css preprocessor languages
00:29 - like sas and less and scss where you use
00:33 - variables it really extends the
00:35 - functionality of css or whatever
00:39 - programming language you're using that
00:41 - are using the variables so in this case
00:43 - we're just going to be using plain
00:44 - vanilla css3 but you do have access to
00:47 - something called custom properties or
00:50 - aka css variables so jump over here in
00:54 - our browser we're just going to be
00:55 - coding a couple simple boxes nothing
00:58 - crazy but the neat thing about this
01:00 - everything we're doing here from the
01:02 - measurements to the colors are are used
01:05 - and created or styled rather via custom
01:09 - properties or css variables so why don't
01:12 - we just jump in and get started so here
01:15 - in my code editor i'm back with atom
01:18 - hopefully it behaves well
01:21 - we have day number 12 css variables go
01:23 - ahead and download that folder
01:26 - open it up in your code editor
01:28 - and then let's jump right back in
01:30 - here in the index you're just going to
01:31 - see the usual
01:33 - that we've been using these past 12 days
01:37 - and just down here you're gonna see in
01:40 - the section just two divs one with the
01:42 - class of box and one with the class of
01:44 - box
01:45 - box two
01:47 - and of course you can go down to the
01:48 - final result and check out uh how that's
01:51 - coded up in the final css there are a
01:54 - lot of comments and notes in here to
01:56 - help you understand why we are doing
01:58 - certain things explaining the custom
02:01 - properties and everything like that but
02:03 - what we're going to concern ourselves
02:05 - with is this file sandbox.css as usual
02:08 - and we're going to get
02:10 - started
02:11 - let's start off by
02:13 - selecting the sandbox class and within
02:16 - there what we're going to do
02:18 - is declare
02:20 - three different variables or custom
02:22 - properties
02:23 - and the way this works with custom
02:25 - properties in css
02:27 - is the when you define that specific
02:30 - custom property within a selector it is
02:33 - its scope is that selector so if you
02:35 - wanted the
02:37 - these variables to be accessible across
02:39 - the entire website and all styles you
02:41 - would use a selector
02:43 - like
02:44 - body
02:46 - or something like
02:49 - root is another selector the root
02:51 - element of a tree representing the
02:53 - document you can use those selectors if
02:54 - you want these specific
02:56 - variables to be accessible throughout
02:58 - the entire document something like a
03:00 - color or a font size or maybe branding
03:03 - specifically branding colors but we're
03:06 - just going to use
03:07 - in this case sandbox so all of the
03:10 - variables are
03:12 - its scope is this selector so the
03:15 - variables won't work if i am trying to
03:18 - use those variables on
03:20 - elements outside of sandbox
03:23 - so this is how you start a selector
03:26 - sorry this is how you start a variable
03:29 - you start out with two dashes and then
03:32 - you name the variable so i'm going to
03:34 - say primary dash color
03:37 - and i'm going to say orange red
03:40 - another variable here
03:42 - i'm going to say secondary
03:44 - color dash color that is
03:46 - hot pink
03:48 - and then double dash base dash
03:51 - measurement
03:52 - 20 pixels so three variables it's not
03:55 - going to do anything if i save this and
03:57 - check it out in the browser it's not
03:58 - going to actually do anything because
03:59 - those aren't actual styles they're just
04:01 - variables now let's go back down here
04:04 - and let's access the variable
04:06 - like so so i'm going to select
04:09 - the sandbox
04:11 - and then
04:12 - box so these are both of the boxes
04:15 - and let's just first of all
04:17 - text align center
04:20 - and now what we're going to do
04:21 - is let's actually add one more variable
04:23 - within sandbox box so now this variable
04:26 - is only accessible within this
04:28 - particular scope within box within
04:31 - sandbox so you can't actually use it
04:33 - outside of this selector
04:36 - or these elements rather
04:38 - so i'm going to say double dash
04:41 - text color it's going to be f3
04:44 - f3 f3
04:47 - okay
04:49 - now here's how we access
04:52 - the variable so i'm going to say
04:55 - color
04:57 - and we have to open it up with var
05:00 - and then opening and closing parentheses
05:02 - and then a semicolon of course and then
05:04 - all you do here is just call the name of
05:07 - the variable that you
05:09 - created
05:10 - double dash
05:12 - and text color text dash color now
05:16 - if i
05:18 - save that and then go over to the
05:19 - browser you're going to see that you
05:21 - cannot see the text and that's because
05:24 - it is the same color as the background
05:25 - in this case or pretty close
05:28 - and it's centered
05:30 - so we know that that variable is working
05:32 - let's continue
05:34 - and style the background and we're going
05:36 - to say var open closing variable or var
05:40 - double dash primary dash color and let's
05:44 - go ahead and say margin
05:46 - and whoops there we go
05:50 - and i'm going to say var
05:53 - this one's going to be base dash
05:55 - measurement which as we know is 20
05:57 - pixels so go ahead and save that check
05:59 - it out in the browser now it's doing
06:01 - something the background is that primary
06:03 - color which is orange red and the base
06:05 - measurement is of margin is 20 pixels it
06:08 - is working so this is nice
06:11 - so now one other cool thing that you can
06:13 - do
06:14 - with the
06:15 - measurements is you can actually do math
06:18 - by using the calc function so let me
06:20 - show you how to do that height
06:24 - we're going to say var
06:27 - and then base measurement das dash
06:30 - measurement but we don't want to just
06:33 - leave it there let's wrap this in calc
06:38 - and then semicolon and we're going to
06:40 - calculate this but then we actually have
06:42 - to perform a calculation so outside of
06:44 - this
06:45 - so this is the first argument here and
06:47 - there's one more
06:48 - times we're going to say times 10 so
06:50 - we're going to calculate the var base
06:52 - measurement or the base measurement
06:54 - times 10
06:55 - and that should equal excuse me 200
06:58 - pixels
06:59 - and then i'm going to copy that paste it
07:01 - i'm going to change this to width i want
07:02 - it to be the same because it is a box
07:05 - and then i want the line height
07:07 - to in fact be the same as well
07:10 - now if i save that i should have perfect
07:12 - boxes head over to the browser there we
07:14 - go all using the variables and the css
07:17 - here let's check it out
07:19 - what shows up so we've got box and then
07:22 - if we look at the styles
07:27 - it actually is showing up as var text
07:29 - color primary color measurement it's
07:31 - actually
07:33 - showing those variables it's not showing
07:34 - the final calculated number in there at
07:36 - least in this developer tools there and
07:38 - so i find that pretty interesting um
07:41 - now let's do let's go back to our code
07:42 - editor and we're gonna do one final
07:44 - thing here if you scroll down
07:47 - beyond that
07:50 - we're gonna say
07:52 - sandbox
07:54 - and then box two we wanna make that
07:56 - color of box 2 different background
07:58 - we've already set up a variable for it
08:01 - var double dash secondary
08:03 - dash color save that in the browser
08:06 - we've got our orange red box number one
08:08 - and our hot pink box number two the
08:10 - colors and the measurements
08:12 - are calculated and created using
08:15 - custom
08:17 - properties also known as css variables
08:20 - that is exciting i hope that shed some
08:23 - light and some insight on some cool
08:25 - things that you could do with css
08:26 - variables instead of having to go in and
08:29 - create uh you know install preprocessors
08:31 - and different uh css languages like sas
08:33 - and less for certain projects that might
08:35 - not be that necessary or too much uh
08:38 - work maybe just a simple landing page
08:40 - and you just want to get something up
08:41 - quickly you can use css variables make
08:45 - sure you check at the bottom of this
08:46 - page here you can see
08:49 - the css3 styles how compatible they are
08:52 - with major browsers if you click that
08:54 - it'll take you to
08:55 - a page called can i use and then you can
08:58 - type in something like
09:02 - css variables custom properties it
09:05 - permits the declaration and usage of
09:06 - cascading variables and style sheets
09:09 - and you can see here how compatible they
09:11 - are so with ie11 it's not supported uh
09:15 - oh well
09:17 - and edge
09:19 - it looks like it's partial support and
09:21 - full support here on 16 firefox fully
09:23 - supported chrome fully supported safari
09:25 - opera ios safari fully supported opera
09:28 - mini not so much android 56 yes uh 4.4
09:32 - no
09:33 - and chrome for android so we're pretty
09:35 - darn
09:37 - um
09:38 - covered here so that's pretty neat uh
09:41 - you can see up here the percentage here
09:42 - so the global percentage is about 77.9
09:45 - percent um
09:48 - compatible so you can rest assured that
09:50 - you're pretty safe using css variables
09:53 - also known as custom properties i hope
09:55 - this lesson was exciting for you and
09:57 - gave you some ideas
09:59 - and quick hot tip if you want to get
10:01 - access to all of these 30 lessons all at
10:04 - once rather than waiting day by day
10:06 - maybe you're ready to take on a
10:07 - challenge and get everything all at once
10:09 - all you got to do is pay five bucks you
10:11 - get all the 30 days plus
10:13 - a full 30 day membership to code college
10:17 - where you get access to all of my coding
10:19 - courses ever
10:21 - and just for five bucks and then after
10:24 - that 30 days if you want to stay then
10:26 - it's just 34 a month afterwards you can
10:28 - cancel at any time
10:30 - basically it's a subscription-based
10:32 - model think netflix for coding tutorials
10:35 - and if you don't want to keep going then
10:37 - all you got to do is cancel before that
10:38 - 30-day window is up so once again all
10:41 - you got to do is head to brad hussey.ca
10:45 - css3 there should be a link up here on
10:48 - the screen go ahead and go there you'll
10:50 - get the first month membership of code
10:52 - college for five bucks that'll get you
10:54 - all the 30 days of these lessons plus
10:56 - every coding course i've ever made
10:58 - and you can have a heyday there and if
11:00 - you want to stick around then it's just
11:01 - 34 bucks a month hope to see you in
11:03 - there if not i'll see you tomorrow for
11:06 - day number 13. bye now

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome back to css3 in 30 days today is day number 12 and we are going to be playing around with something called css variables there's also you can call it custom properties uh but that's not as exciting css variables especially for uh developers and designers out there who are familiar with variables in languages like php or jquery or even using css preprocessor languages like sas and less and scss where you use variables it really extends the functionality of css or whatever programming language you're using that are using the variables so in this case we're just going to be using plain vanilla css3 but you do have access to something called custom properties or aka css variables so jump over here in our browser we're just going to be coding a couple simple boxes nothing crazy but the neat thing about this everything we're doing here from the measurements to the colors are are used and created or styled rather via custom properties or css variables so why don't we just jump in and get started so here in my code editor i'm back with atom hopefully it behaves well we have day number 12 css variables go ahead and download that folder open it up in your code editor and then let's jump right back in here in the index you're just going to see the usual that we've been using these past 12 days and just down here you're gonna see in the section just two divs one with the class of box and one with the class of box box two and of course you can go down to the final result and check out uh how that's coded up in the final css there are a lot of comments and notes in here to help you understand why we are doing certain things explaining the custom properties and everything like that but what we're going to concern ourselves with is this file
