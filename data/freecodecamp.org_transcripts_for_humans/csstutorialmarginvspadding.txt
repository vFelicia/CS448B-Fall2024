00:13 - paragraphs if we assign the margin
00:15 - property and gradually increase its

00:20 - separated from each other padding is the
00:22 - internal space the space between the
00:25 - border of each element and its content
00:27 - it we assign padding to the divs and
00:29 - then gradually increase the value we can
00:31 - see how their content separates from the
00:34 - border gradually moving inwards we can
00:36 - assign the same value or different
00:38 - values for each one of the four sides of
