00:00 - hey this is Andrew Brown your Cloud
00:02 - instructor at exam Pro bringing you
00:04 - another complete study course and this
00:06 - time it's the Google Cloud digital
00:07 - leader made available to you here on
00:09 - free code Camp so this course is
00:12 - designed to help you pass and Achieve
00:14 - Google issued certification and the way
00:17 - we're going to do that is by going
00:18 - through lots of lecture content follow
00:20 - alongs and using my cheat sheets on the
00:22 - day of the exam so you pass and you can
00:25 - take that certification and put it on
00:27 - your resume or LinkedIn so you can get
00:29 - that Cloud job or promotion you've been
00:31 - looking for just a bit about me I was
00:33 - previously the CTO of multiple edtech
00:36 - companies with 15 years industry
00:38 - experience five years specializing in
00:40 - the cloud I'm an AWS Community hero I
00:42 - publish many free Cloud certification
00:45 - courses just like this one and I love
00:47 - Star Trek and coconut water I just want
00:50 - to take a moment here to thank viewers
00:52 - like you because you make these free
00:53 - courses possible if you're looking for
00:56 - more ways of supporting more free
00:58 - courses just like this one the best ways
01:00 - to to buy the extra study material at
01:03 - exampro.co and in particular for this
01:06 - certification it's gcp hyphen CDL there
01:10 - you can get study notes flash cards
01:11 - quizlets downloadable lectures which are
01:14 - the slides to all the lecture videos
01:16 - downloadable cheat sheets which by the
01:18 - way are free if you just go sign up
01:20 - practice exams you can also ask
01:22 - questions and get learning support
01:25 - if you want to keep up to date with new
01:27 - courses I'm working on the best ways to

01:32 - you I'd love to hear if you've passed
01:34 - your exam or what you'd like to see next
01:36 - so there you go
01:39 - [Music]
01:42 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
01:45 - and we are at the start of our journey
01:46 - asking the most important question first
01:48 - which is what is the Google Cloud
01:50 - digital leader so the digital leader is
01:53 - a fundamental or a foundational Cloud
01:55 - certification that introduces you to the
01:57 - Core Concepts of cloud and Google cloud
01:59 - in particular so the certification will
02:02 - demonstrate a person can Define and
02:03 - understand digital transformation Cloud
02:06 - Concepts core services such as compute
02:08 - storage databases and networking
02:09 - security and cost management for
02:12 - fundamental certifications they like to
02:14 - always put a bit of emphasis on security
02:16 - and cost management and for the digital
02:18 - leader
02:19 - there's a lot of talk about digital
02:21 - transformation which is a industry term
02:23 - but Google uses it quite frequently not
02:26 - in the exam questions themselves but
02:28 - something we'll have to understand
02:30 - the certification has no known course
02:33 - code so I'll be calling it the gcp CDL
02:36 - this is the first certification you
02:38 - should obtain in your Learning Journey
02:41 - and I'll show you in the next slide uh
02:43 - why that is this is an easy course to
02:46 - pass however it is more challenging than
02:48 - other fundamental certifications so
02:50 - we'll spend quite a bit of time just
02:52 - describing it compared to other
02:54 - fundamental certifications so here is
02:56 - the gcp roadmap as you can see there
02:59 - aren't a lot of certifications for gcp
03:01 - which is a good thing because it's very
03:03 - focused however it's a bit laid out
03:06 - differently in the in the fact that they
03:08 - have professional certifications and
03:10 - these are not necessarily difficult so
03:14 - when you see a professional
03:15 - certification for AWS you know it's
03:17 - really hard but some of these or most of
03:20 - these are like the difficulty of an AWS
03:22 - associate which is a bit odd then they
03:25 - have an associate tier where they only
03:26 - have a single certification and then we
03:28 - have the New Foundation certification
03:31 - the one we're looking at today the cloud
03:33 - digital leader I've also divided this
03:35 - here we have the professional and I
03:37 - these are also professional
03:39 - certifications here but I kind of treat
03:40 - these as Specialties and that's what
03:42 - this line indicates okay so uh in terms
03:45 - of your learning path you should start
03:47 - with the cloud digital leader and
03:49 - especially for gcp just because of the
03:52 - way they write the questions it's so
03:54 - different from the other providers I
03:55 - strongly recommend that you get
03:56 - comfortable with the cloud digital
03:58 - leader very common to go for the cloud
04:00 - engineer and after that the cloud
04:02 - architect the cloud architect is like
04:04 - the solutions architect associate of gcp
04:07 - uh I mean it's harder than the uh the
04:10 - solution architect associate but it's
04:11 - not hard overall and it's not as uh code
04:16 - heavy or technology heavy it's More
04:18 - Concept heavy from there you can move on
04:20 - to the cloud developer or the devops
04:22 - just depends on your specialty and then
04:24 - in the Specialties it's up to you what
04:26 - you want to do collaboration engineer is
04:28 - a very unusually named certification
04:30 - this one in particular is it's like
04:35 - Administration so like it's uh you know
04:37 - setting up your organization and and
04:39 - networking it's a very odd name for a
04:42 - certification
04:43 - um but they have it there if it was me
04:45 - if it was me going into the Specialties
04:46 - I'd either go for the cloud security
04:48 - engineer data engineer or machine
04:49 - learning engineer Cloud networking I
04:52 - don't know how useful that is neither is
04:53 - the collaborator okay
04:55 - so how long should I study to pass the
04:58 - gcp CDL so if you're new to gcp you're
05:01 - looking at 25 hours of study this is
05:03 - longer than what I generally recommend
05:04 - for study times for fundamentals but
05:07 - because the exams are more difficult
05:10 - we'll talk about in a moment that's why
05:11 - it's higher if you've already passed the
05:13 - certified AWS certified Cloud
05:16 - partitioner or the Azure fundamentals
05:18 - you're looking at a 15 hour study time
05:20 - um you know there is a lot of
05:22 - transferable information but again it's
05:24 - the fact that their exam questions are
05:26 - uh more difficult
05:28 - if you've passed either the solutions
05:31 - architect associate or the Azure
05:34 - administrator you're looking at a very
05:37 - short study time you'll be able to knock
05:39 - this out in a few days okay so my
05:42 - recommended study time is one to two
05:43 - hours for 14 days uh generally with the
05:46 - AZ 900 or the certified Cloud petitioner
05:49 - I would say just book it by the end of
05:51 - the week for this one you need a little
05:52 - bit of extra time so if you want to book
05:55 - the exam to have confidence and make
05:56 - sure you're going to commit to your
05:57 - studies I'd say book it 10 days 11 days
06:00 - or even 14 days in advance okay so how
06:03 - does it compare against the AWS Cloud
06:06 - partitioner and the AZ 900 so the we'll
06:11 - use the cloud practitioner as the
06:12 - Baseline for our fundamental
06:14 - certifications because it was one of the
06:16 - earliest ones it's also one of the like
06:18 - the best written ones okay then we have
06:21 - our Azure fundamentals the AZ 900 and
06:23 - then the Google digital leader so
06:25 - Baseline is going to be one right and so
06:27 - the clf c01 is the easiest fundamental
06:30 - certification still is today as
06:31 - straightforward services and
06:34 - straightforward questions well-ridden
06:36 - questions and that's what makes it so
06:37 - easy to pass and to grasp Cloud
06:41 - fundamental knowledge for the Azure
06:43 - fundamentals this is the AZ 900 it's a
06:46 - bit harder than the certified Cloud
06:48 - practitioner just because azure's
06:50 - services are a little bit more muddled
06:52 - Azure likes to or Microsoft likes to
06:55 - meet everyone's demands and so they
06:57 - really tack on a lot of stuff but that
06:59 - adds to a lot of confusion whereas AWS
07:01 - is very isolate Services the questions
07:04 - are slightly more difficult just the way
07:06 - they word them and so let's say it's 1.5
07:08 - times harder when we're looking at the
07:10 - Google cloud or the cloud digital leader
07:13 - it's three times harder than the cloud
07:16 - practitioner and I believe that this was
07:17 - actually by Design because I think that
07:20 - a lot of people think that while because
07:22 - of the cloud practitioners very easy
07:24 - that it doesn't hold a lot of value so
07:27 - gcp does not decided to just make this
07:29 - harder I don't really agree with that
07:31 - approach but that's what they did now
07:33 - the services in gcp are probably the
07:35 - easiest to learn out of all the
07:37 - providers they're very very
07:38 - straightforward but the questions are
07:40 - presented in a business-like scenario so
07:42 - it's a lot like the solutions architect
07:44 - associate exam and that makes it a lot
07:46 - harder to um to study for because you'll
07:50 - have to spend more time with practice
07:51 - exams okay and there are some Services
07:54 - where you'd expect additional knowledge
07:57 - so one example would be cloud storage or
07:59 - you have to actually know the the tiers
08:01 - of cloud storage it's something that you
08:03 - wouldn't see like AWS with S3 you
08:05 - wouldn't have to know that and so
08:07 - there's those kind of stuff another
08:08 - thing is they just have a lot of tricky
08:10 - questions or poorly worded questions I'd
08:11 - say out of the three they have the worst
08:13 - written exam questions uh now to say
08:17 - that doesn't mean you shouldn't go get
08:18 - the cloud digital leader I have this
08:20 - course here for a reason I believe
08:22 - there's a lot of value here but you just
08:23 - have to understand that you know there's
08:24 - trade-offs depending on what you do with
08:26 - all these things okay so uh where are
08:29 - you going to take this exam well you can
08:30 - take it in person or in an online from
08:33 - the convenience of your own home with
08:35 - other providers you usually use PSI and
08:37 - Pearson VUE but Google uses Criterion
08:40 - and actually the exam experience was
08:42 - really good I liked it out of every
08:44 - single um online Proctor system I've
08:46 - ever used Criterion is great I don't
08:49 - know if they're switching over to
08:50 - proctoru they were using it for the G
08:52 - Suite certification
08:54 - um prior and so I don't know if they're
08:56 - going to switch providers it's I'm not
08:57 - really I've read it at one place they
08:59 - said they were but now they're not so I
09:02 - don't know but anyway if you are going
09:03 - to use Criterion it's pretty easy to use
09:05 - uh if you've never heard the term
09:07 - proctored it just means that there's
09:08 - somebody or there's a supervisor
09:10 - monitoring you right so even if you take
09:11 - it online what they'll do is they'll ask
09:13 - you to like uh at the start of the call
09:15 - to say Okay show us under your desk all
09:17 - four walls make sure you're not cheating
09:19 - right so they're there to monitor you
09:21 - okay
09:21 - and a proctor is technically also in
09:24 - person but a lot of times we say Proctor
09:25 - exams we're referring to the online
09:27 - exams so what does it take to pass the
09:29 - example you got to watch the lecture
09:31 - videos memorize key information you're
09:32 - going to need to do Hands-On labs and
09:34 - follow along within your own gcp account
09:36 - now this is the thing
09:38 - um if you read the if you read the
09:40 - requirements for gcp
09:43 - they say you don't have to do any follow
09:44 - alongs and that is a hundred percent
09:46 - total lie so uh it's just like there's
09:49 - no way there's no way you'd pass without
09:50 - doing follow along so I put in some
09:52 - follow-ons to help you cement that
09:54 - knowledge in this course okay uh do paid
09:57 - online practice exams normally for
09:59 - fundamental certifications you can get
10:01 - away with not doing them so like the AZ
10:03 - 900 or the certified Cloud petitioner
10:05 - it's that easy but in this case you
10:07 - absolutely 100 percent need practice
10:09 - exam questions because just the way they
10:11 - word them they're so hard and I'm going
10:13 - to tell you right now I'm the only
10:15 - provider that I know of that actually
10:17 - have these questions because
10:18 - um you know I took the exam the day it
10:20 - came out and I was the first to make
10:22 - sure I had a lot of questions okay so
10:26 - this again this is harder this is very
10:28 - hard to pass without practice exam
10:30 - questions so
10:31 - um you know go on the platform sign up
10:33 - and help support more free courses but
10:37 - if you do pass without using uh practice
10:39 - exams I'd love to hear uh like uh to you
10:42 - and like how much extra time you had to
10:43 - study okay for the content outline
10:46 - here's another Oddity that they don't do
10:48 - is they don't break down each of the
10:50 - domains usually you'll have a percentage
10:52 - here saying like Okay you're gonna get
10:54 - 20 of questions of this so we know where
10:56 - to focus our time but Google doesn't do
10:58 - that so we'll just read through the
11:00 - domains here so setting up a Cloud
11:02 - solution environment planning and
11:04 - configuring a Cloud solution deploying
11:06 - and implementing a Cloud solution
11:07 - ensuring successful operation of a Cloud
11:09 - solution configuring access and security
11:12 - and the distribution of these domains
11:14 - are not known we do not know what they
11:16 - are however on the marketing website
11:18 - they said the following they said well
11:20 - general knowledge General
11:23 - Google Cloud knowledge and Google Cloud
11:26 - product services this is what the
11:27 - breakdown is this is not very helpful
11:29 - because I mean we need to know what
11:31 - these are right because this is what
11:32 - they're testing us on there's a huge
11:33 - breakdown for this but I mean like I
11:35 - guess you kind of get the idea so
11:38 - um do I think this is reflective yeah
11:41 - sure I guess so
11:43 - um in terms of grading you just have to
11:44 - get a 70 to pass it is uh scaled like
11:47 - most other Courses mean that it's not
11:50 - always uh exactly 70 to pass but
11:53 - generally that's what it's going to be
11:54 - in terms of the type of questions you'll
11:56 - get 60 of them so you can afford to get
11:58 - 18 wrong there's no penalty for wrong
12:00 - questions the formatted questions are
12:02 - multiple choice and multiple answer I
12:04 - think I only saw one multiple answer
12:07 - like out of the whole course so it was
12:09 - mostly multiple choice which is great
12:12 - but again the questions are the the
12:14 - actual body of the questions is the hard
12:16 - part okay for the duration you get 1.5
12:19 - hours you get additional time a lot of
12:21 - other providers give you only an hour so
12:23 - I really appreciate they gave me extra
12:25 - time I cleared it within 30 minutes but
12:27 - I imagine that if you know if this is
12:29 - your first time you'll need that full
12:30 - time make sure you utilize all of the
12:33 - time when you're taking that core uh
12:34 - when you're taking the exam you're gonna
12:36 - get 1.5 minutes per questions other
12:37 - providers that only give you one minute
12:39 - per question so this exam time is 90
12:41 - minutes the C time is 120 Minutes see
12:44 - time refers to the amount of time that
12:46 - you should allocate for the exam so that
12:48 - includes time to review instructions
12:50 - Show online Proctor your workspace read
12:52 - and accept the NDA complete the exam
12:54 - provide feedback at the end of the exam
12:56 - uh and so you do want if you're taking
12:58 - it online you have to show up early okay
13:00 - and be ready make sure your laptop is
13:02 - plugged in this is actually valid for
13:04 - three years which is great
13:06 - um AWS used to have them for two years I
13:08 - think they extended the CCP to three
13:10 - years Azure is they're just good forever
13:12 - but I like this thing where it's just
13:14 - three years but there you go so that is
13:17 - um the introduction here and what we'll
13:19 - do is we'll go take a look at the actual
13:20 - exam guide so I can just kind of talk
13:22 - through some of the things there like
13:24 - what I thought actually showed up on the
13:26 - exam as opposed to uh didn't okay
13:29 - [Music]
13:34 - hey it's Andrew Brown from exam Pro and
13:36 - we are taking a look at the official
13:37 - exam guide on the Google Cloud website
13:39 - now it's a bit different than other
13:40 - providers which will give you a
13:42 - downloadable PDF but that's not what
13:44 - Google does they just make it inline
13:46 - HTML but before we do that we're just
13:47 - going to look at the exam overview so
13:49 - here you can see where I grab those
13:51 - General percentages it's a hundred
13:53 - dollar registration fee uh 90 minutes
13:55 - this is going to vary based on your
13:56 - region probably but I mean I assume it's
13:59 - always showed up in USD dollars they do
14:01 - have some recommended resources
14:03 - um which you can click through like
14:05 - these here and they are terrible and
14:07 - they are not relevant to the exam and I
14:09 - actually went through every single one
14:11 - of these because I thought that I might
14:13 - be missing out on some information I'm
14:14 - going to tell you waste of time don't do
14:16 - it
14:17 - um I mean like if you wanted to kind of
14:19 - get like indoctrined into the way Google
14:21 - thinks about their products sure but I
14:23 - did not like them whatsoever they're all
14:26 - available like via quick Labs there's
14:28 - probably Coursera courses but the reason
14:30 - I make this course is because I don't
14:32 - want you have to pay for something to
14:33 - get access to that and that's the whole
14:35 - reason here
14:36 - um now there actually are there are
14:38 - really good Resources by Google cloud or
14:41 - developer Advocates and that's stuff
14:43 - that I do recommend but this stuff
14:45 - absolutely not but let's make our way
14:46 - over to the exam guide okay and here it
14:49 - is it's a pretty darn long and so we'll
14:51 - just work our way down here and I'll
14:52 - just say like what I saw on the exam and
14:54 - what I didn't okay so at the top here we
14:57 - have defined basic Cloud technology so
14:59 - uh know the difference between
15:01 - traditional infrastructure or public
15:03 - private Cloud yeah I think I saw one or
15:05 - two questions on that where you had to
15:07 - choose between private or public Cloud
15:09 - Define Cloud infrastructure ownership so
15:12 - that's the I don't know what that means
15:14 - I assume that just means the shared
15:15 - responsibility model the share
15:17 - responsibility model did not show up on
15:19 - my exam and neither on my uh support
15:22 - Engineers so you know that wasn't uh
15:25 - very useful information essentially
15:27 - essential characteristics of cloud
15:28 - computing again uh I think actually I
15:31 - did see one it was uh like multi it was
15:33 - my only multi-select one so yeah I
15:36 - suppose you'd have to know that
15:37 - um Google doesn't have like a official
15:40 - definition of characters of cloud
15:41 - computing like Azure and AWS does so I
15:44 - kind of just provided one that was
15:46 - between the two of AWS and Azure okay
15:48 - another difference between uh past
15:51 - infrastructure service software service
15:52 - definitely saw questions on that
15:54 - describe the trade-offs between levels
15:56 - of management uh flexibility when
15:57 - comparing cloud services didn't see any
16:00 - questions on that to find the trade-offs
16:01 - between costs versus responsibility
16:03 - didn't see any questions on that either
16:05 - appropriate implementation alignment
16:06 - with given budget resources so there
16:08 - they might be talking about like
16:09 - different kinds of built-in Cloud
16:12 - reports or using budget alarms so that
16:15 - was definitely on the exam so you'd want
16:17 - to know that capex and Opex total cost
16:20 - of operations okay so AWS calls it total
16:23 - cost of um ownership I guess operations
16:25 - is what Google calls it never saw that
16:28 - in their documentation by the way but I
16:30 - included it because I assumed you know
16:31 - you need to know it they don't ask that
16:34 - there they might have had a I think they
16:35 - had like a
16:37 - example of a capex so there was one for
16:39 - that
16:40 - recognize the relationship between the
16:42 - two summarize the cost differences
16:44 - between cloud and on-premise
16:46 - environments not necessarily a direct
16:48 - question to it but a lot of questions
16:49 - revolve around migration or uh you know
16:53 - the difference between on-premise and
16:55 - Cloud so not necessarily call out to
16:57 - those questions but part of a lot of
16:58 - questions okay recognize uh your or
17:02 - general Google Cloud knowledge recognize
17:03 - how Google Cloud meets compliance
17:05 - requirements locating current cloud
17:07 - Google Cloud compliance requirements
17:11 - um nope never never had a question on
17:12 - that familiar with compliance report
17:13 - manager never had a question on that
17:15 - recognize the main elements of Google
17:17 - Cloud resource hierarchy uh yeah they
17:20 - actually had quite a few questions on
17:22 - this and these ones are hard you know I
17:24 - don't even know why they put this in at
17:26 - the fundamental level just seems too
17:28 - hard but I I cover this in the course
17:30 - for sure describe controlling and
17:32 - optimizing Google Cloud costs so Billy
17:35 - models so that's the different bill
17:36 - built-in models or reports Define a
17:39 - consumption based use model so
17:42 - this is all like about billing like
17:44 - sustainable you like sustained billing
17:46 - and on demand and whether you use
17:49 - something that is um
17:51 - uh like you're using reserved compute
17:53 - things like that
17:54 - describe Google Cloud's geographical
17:57 - segmentation strategy this is what I was
17:59 - surprised about the most is that there
18:01 - was no Global infrastructure questions
18:03 - on my exam whatsoever and I always give
18:06 - a lot of attention to Global
18:08 - infrastructure and networking because
18:10 - those are some of the hardest Concepts
18:12 - to understand the fundamental level but
18:14 - they didn't have any questions
18:15 - whatsoever they just focused a lot more
18:18 - on resource hierarchies and migration
18:20 - Define Google Cloud Support options uh
18:23 - never ever saw a single question on
18:25 - support like hey what do you get if you
18:28 - get Enterprise no questions nothing on
18:30 - slas either describe the benefits of
18:33 - Google Cloud VMS Google so compute
18:37 - engine VMware engine bare metal didn't
18:39 - have any questions on that custom versus
18:42 - standard sizing
18:45 - um nope free premium and Custom Service
18:47 - options attached storages preemptable
18:49 - VMS of course you need to know what uh
18:51 - preemptable VMS are but like this stuff
18:55 - not really like there's no questions
18:56 - around bare metal
18:58 - identify and evaluate container-based
19:00 - compute options so Define the function
19:02 - of a container registry distinguish
19:04 - between VMS containers Google kubernetes
19:06 - engine no not really I think I might
19:09 - have had one question about containers I
19:11 - like to use cloud run
19:13 - identify and evaluate serverless compute
19:15 - options to find the function and use of
19:17 - app engine
19:18 - yes I had a few questions on app engine
19:21 - between the distinction of standard
19:24 - versus flexible so you need to know
19:26 - those two different plans nothing on
19:27 - cloud functions Define rational rational
19:30 - for versioning with serverless compute
19:32 - auctions didn't have a question on that
19:33 - cost and performance trade-offs to scale
19:35 - to zero
19:37 - um no no questions to that identify and
19:39 - evaluate multiple data management
19:40 - offerings so describe the difference
19:42 - between Google Cloud's relational
19:44 - non-relational database uh yeah I had
19:46 - quite a few questions on that so uh I
19:49 - saw all four of these options presented
19:51 - to me during questions describe Google
19:53 - Cloud's database offering and how they
19:55 - compare commercials offering nothing on
19:57 - that distinguish between mlai offerings
20:00 - I I think they had like one question
20:02 - about ML and it was just like what would
20:04 - you use to do vision and it was like
20:06 - Vision API you know that was it okay
20:09 - uh moving data around between pipelines
20:12 - uh yeah there was a lot of questions
20:14 - about migration so you know you had to
20:16 - know clearly the difference between
20:18 - these offerings here
20:19 - apply use case to a high level Google
20:22 - Cloud architecture so software
20:24 - development lifecycle never mentioned in
20:26 - the exams describe Google Cloud platform
20:28 - visibility alert offerings like that's
20:31 - just like billing alarms budget alarms
20:33 - whatever they call them describe
20:35 - solutions for migrating workloads lots
20:37 - of stuff on this lots of stuff on
20:39 - Migrate for anthos migrate to compute
20:41 - engine something you need to know down
20:43 - through networking no networking in the
20:45 - in the exam whatsoever never ever I
20:48 - don't even cover this in the course I
20:49 - don't think sd-wan but it was not on the
20:52 - exam and I would not expect this on a
20:54 - fundamental certification just makes no
20:56 - sense describe the best connectivity
20:58 - option between networking security
20:59 - requirements
21:00 - um so you should know like interconnect
21:02 - and then establishing secure connections
21:05 - via VIA VPN so those are pretty standard
21:07 - private Google access
21:09 - um yeah so that's just making sure that
21:11 - you have an instance that doesn't go out
21:13 - to the internet Define identity and
21:16 - access features considering included so
21:18 - Cloud identity uh
21:20 - Google Cloud directory sync I am so all
21:23 - of those so yeah um that gives you kind
21:25 - of an idea
21:27 - um
21:28 - you know I would say this is not very
21:29 - reflective of the actual exam you know
21:31 - what I mean like I'd say like you know
21:33 - 60 70 of the stuff I saw
21:36 - um and I think maybe it's just that uh
21:38 - it's still early days and so if you're
21:40 - watching this from a year from now from
21:41 - I publish it maybe they've made more
21:43 - questions but I was just thinking that
21:44 - they just don't have a very large
21:45 - question bank because when I had my
21:47 - support Engineers take it they're
21:48 - getting pretty much the same stuff as I
21:50 - was where there was like why wasn't
21:52 - there any Global infrastructure stuff so
21:54 - you know um I was very thorough in this
21:57 - course because I just did not know what
21:58 - I was going to get and there was nobody
22:00 - else before me that made this course uh
22:02 - so I just covered everything just in
22:04 - case so if you're watching this from a
22:06 - year or two from now you should be in
22:07 - very good shape because I was very
22:09 - thorough okay
22:10 - foreign
22:14 - [Music]
22:15 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
22:17 - and what I want to show you here is an
22:19 - additional resource that I think is
22:21 - going to help you pass the Google Cloud
22:22 - digital leader and so I'm here on the
22:27 - cloudgirl.dev and this website is by
22:29 - Priyanka she's a Google developer
22:32 - advocate so she knows her stuff but what
22:35 - I find that's really useful is she makes
22:36 - all these great sketches that help
22:39 - visualize a lot of the core services so
22:42 - you know I'm not doing tons of
22:44 - visualizations in the course uh and I'm
22:46 - just giving you just the need to know
22:48 - information but if you check these out
22:50 - it might help you cement the information
22:52 - a bit better and of course there's a lot
22:55 - of accompanying uh videos to these
22:57 - sketches here so if you go to the cloud
22:59 - Girls YouTube there's a lot of great
23:01 - videos here so strongly recommend that
23:03 - if you feel that you you feel that
23:05 - there's a deficit whether it's a compute
23:07 - engine or gke or whatever just to go
23:09 - check out these additional resources
23:11 - okay
23:12 - foreign
23:16 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
23:18 - and we are at the start of our journey
23:20 - for the cloud digital leader Google
23:22 - Cloud certification asking the most
23:25 - important question first which is what
23:27 - is cloud computing so cloud computing uh
23:31 - per definition is the practice of using
23:33 - a network of remote servers hosted on
23:35 - the internet to store manage and process
23:37 - data rather than a local server or
23:39 - personal computer and the way I like to
23:42 - think of it is that if you're on premise
23:44 - you own the servers you hire the IT
23:46 - people you pay the rent and the real
23:48 - estate you take all the risks but when
23:50 - you're using a cloud provider someone
23:52 - else owns the servers someone else hires
23:54 - the IT people someone else pays or rents
23:57 - the real estate and you're only
23:59 - responsible for configuring cloud
24:00 - services and code and someone else takes
24:03 - care of the rest okay
24:05 - [Music]
24:10 - so to truly understand cloud computing
24:12 - we have to understand how we got to
24:14 - Cloud hosting and the way to do that is
24:16 - we're going to walk through uh how
24:19 - servers changed over time and uh the
24:22 - benefits and drawbacks to these
24:23 - different types of servers so the First
24:25 - on our list here is a dedicated server
24:27 - this was a physical machine that you
24:30 - would go out to a store and you'd
24:31 - purchase and you'd put it in your office
24:33 - you'd have to set up the networking
24:35 - install everything even installed the
24:37 - operating system and the great thing
24:40 - about these things is that you would get
24:42 - full control over your server and so
24:45 - theoretically you would have the highest
24:47 - level of security possible I say it's
24:50 - theoretical because of course with cloud
24:52 - computing you have all these additional
24:54 - services that monitor and do things for
24:57 - you but this was again the earliest
25:01 - option out there and so they're still in
25:04 - use we still have dedicated servers
25:05 - today but you know it just made it very
25:08 - inaccessible for most people to be able
25:10 - to run web apps or Etc then we had
25:13 - virtual private servers
25:15 - so we're still using one physical
25:17 - machine but now what we've done is we've
25:20 - isolated a virtually isolated our
25:23 - application using something called
25:25 - virtual machines basically into sub
25:28 - machines and that allows us to run
25:29 - multiple workloads
25:31 - because if you have different machines
25:33 - with or sorry different apps with
25:35 - different requirements by virtualizing
25:38 - the machine we're now able to meet the
25:39 - needs of each application and so that
25:42 - was the evolution there going from there
25:45 - we had shared hosting this became very
25:47 - popular in the early 2000s if you've
25:49 - ever used GoDaddy or HostGator you've
25:51 - used shared hosting the idea is you'd
25:54 - have one physical machine and instead of
25:56 - virtually isolating each customer or
25:59 - tenant from each other you just had a
26:01 - folder on the machine and you could have
26:03 - hundreds and hundreds of businesses on a
26:05 - single machine and the way the system
26:07 - worked is that you know you had limits
26:09 - in place but also there was an
26:12 - expectation that there just would be a
26:14 - lot of people that would be under
26:15 - utilizing the physical machine and so
26:18 - there'd just be a few people that might
26:20 - over utilize it and so it'd work out to
26:22 - be very cheap but you know because it's
26:24 - not full virtualization you don't have
26:27 - full access to the OS and things like
26:29 - that so it was very limited and there is
26:32 - also the chance that some other customer
26:34 - could end up over utilizing the machine
26:37 - and that could impact your workload all
26:39 - right so then came along Cloud hosting
26:42 - and this is where instead of having a
26:44 - single machine you had multiple machines
26:47 - and they would have virtualization right
26:52 - and so the idea is that now you could
26:54 - have a lot more customers on the exact
26:58 - same machine and it's highly distributed
27:00 - so you don't have to worry about One
27:02 - customer over using a single machine and
27:05 - you basically get the best of all worlds
27:07 - so it's flexible scalable it's really
27:09 - secure it's really cost effective it's
27:11 - highly configurable and that's basically
27:13 - the reason why Cloud hosting or cloud
27:16 - computing is so uh popular today
27:19 - [Music]
27:24 - so before we talk about Google Cloud we
27:26 - need to ask ourselves what is Google so
27:28 - Google is an American multinational
27:30 - technology corporation headquartered in
27:32 - Mountain View California and its claim
27:35 - to fame was in 1996 when they invented
27:37 - the Google search engine and so uh the
27:40 - reason why this is such a big deal was
27:42 - that prior to Google and really it
27:45 - didn't really take off until 2000
27:47 - because I remember when this thing came
27:49 - out where we saw Mass adoption but it
27:51 - was just that other search engines at
27:53 - the time like Alta Vista hotbot all the
27:55 - ones out there just couldn't do a very
27:58 - good job of finding things but Google
28:00 - was smart that they would actually look
28:02 - at the contents of web pages they would
28:04 - cache them and that's how they would
28:06 - determine whether to serve you content
28:08 - another very impressive thing that they
28:10 - did was they didn't use high-end
28:12 - machines that didn't have the money but
28:14 - they had the money to buy up a bunch of
28:15 - low end machines and that created new
28:17 - technology to distribute compute and
28:20 - storage across those machines and that
28:22 - technology is now open source and it's
28:24 - called Hadoop and we'll talk about it
28:26 - later in the course but that is
28:28 - something that was very impressive as
28:29 - well so the name Google is actually a
28:32 - play on the word Google it's just a
28:34 - different spelling and that word
28:36 - precisely means 10 to the power of 100
28:39 - and so if you represent it out in this
28:42 - way the idea was that you had a one
28:43 - followed by a lot of zeros
28:45 - and so I guess this is Google saying hey
28:48 - we are a data driven company we work
28:50 - with a lot of data and that's true they
28:52 - do Google is also an initialism for
28:55 - Global organization of oriented group
28:57 - language of Earth you can tell that they
29:00 - came up with the word Google and then
29:01 - they just decided to try to make it uh
29:04 - into something make it to something so I
29:06 - know that doesn't make a whole lot of
29:07 - sense so that's just you know they're
29:08 - having fun I guess back then another
29:10 - thing we need to understand is what is a
29:12 - cloud service provider so a cloud
29:14 - service provider commonly abbreviated to
29:16 - CSP is it company which provides
29:19 - multiple cloud services and those cloud
29:21 - services can be chained together to
29:23 - create Cloud architectures so here is a
29:27 - technical architecture for gcp and this
29:30 - is actually a web application and this
29:33 - is a pretty standard one so you might
29:34 - run your web app on a compute engine
29:36 - which is where your virtual machine is
29:38 - you might have assets and things you
29:40 - need to store into cloud storage so this
29:42 - is like your files and stuff you need a
29:44 - database so maybe you need a postgres
29:45 - data base like Cloud SQL you might have
29:48 - a CDN that sits in front of your web app
29:50 - just to Cache commonly occurring Pages
29:54 - then you need a mechanism to actually
29:56 - deploy the application so maybe you want
29:58 - to set all this up deploy multiple apps
30:01 - the same structure so you can use cloud
30:02 - deployment manager
30:04 - and maybe you have a really fun uh or a
30:07 - very useful way of doing customer
30:09 - support by having a conversational AI
30:12 - like dialogflow
30:14 - so there are lots of applications out
30:16 - there so this combination can get very
30:19 - uh very variant but this is a pretty
30:22 - common example okay so now the question
30:25 - is what is the Google Cloud platform
30:27 - well this is what Google calls their uh
30:30 - their because they are a CSP so this is
30:33 - what they call uh their platform and
30:35 - it's commonly referred to as the gcp and
30:38 - also it's Google Cloud so I don't know
30:40 - why but they don't use the word like in
30:43 - their logos they don't use the word
30:44 - platform but everyone knows it as Google
30:46 - Cloud platform and we all call it gcp
30:48 - and the first service they came out with
30:50 - was app engine all the way back in 2008
30:53 - I don't remember them calling it Google
30:55 - Cloud at the time I think it was just
30:56 - they wanted a way for people to be able
30:58 - to deploy applications really easily uh
31:02 - so I'm a little bit fuzzy about that
31:04 - there but now you know when we look
31:06 - retroactively back you can say Okay app
31:08 - engine was the first service they ever
31:10 - released then there's also Google
31:12 - workspace and you're probably familiar
31:15 - with this uh because everyone got their
31:17 - Gmail over 10 years ago and so Google
31:20 - workspace it's just a rebranding of G
31:22 - suite and so it's a bundled offering of
31:24 - SAS products for team communication
31:25 - collaboration for an organization so
31:27 - there you got Google Calendar Gmail
31:30 - Google meet Google Drive Google Sheets
31:33 - Google Docs Google slides and you know
31:36 - this course isn't really about Google
31:38 - workspace or the G Suite but you know it
31:40 - does overlap because when we talk about
31:43 - identity getting access to your Google
31:45 - Cloud
31:46 - console things like that it can tie into
31:49 - Google workspace and so that's why I
31:51 - mentioning it here and you're going to
31:52 - see it mentioned a few times in this
31:54 - course okay
31:55 - [Music]
31:59 - so let's talk about the benefits or the
32:01 - advantages of cloud computing no matter
32:04 - what cloud service provider you're using
32:06 - you need to know these and they're
32:07 - generally six to seven points and in
32:10 - particular for Google Cloud they don't
32:12 - ask you these questions on the
32:14 - fundamental exam like they're not going
32:16 - to say can you tell me three of the six
32:17 - but uh they do matter you need to know
32:20 - them because uh contextually they help
32:22 - you understand how to answer other
32:24 - questions okay and so Google doesn't
32:27 - really have a list like like Azure
32:29 - native will actually have a page and
32:30 - they'll say exactly what they are and so
32:32 - I just had to repurpose these uh from
32:34 - Azure here just to so that you can
32:37 - understand what they are okay so the
32:39 - first one is that cloud computing is
32:41 - cost effective you pay for what you
32:43 - consume there's no upfront cost so the
32:46 - idea here is that you have on-demand
32:48 - pricing or pay as you go so when we're
32:50 - talking about AWS likes to call it on
32:52 - demand and Azure likes to call it pay as
32:55 - you go and and so that's just two
32:58 - different ways of saying it but the idea
33:00 - here is you have thousands of customers
33:01 - sharing the cost of resources remember
33:03 - when we looked at
33:05 - um Cloud hosting and we saw that there
33:06 - was more than one customer on the same
33:08 - machine that's how we're talking about
33:10 - it being cost effective because you
33:11 - don't have to pay for the entire machine
33:13 - another benefit is that cloud computing
33:16 - allows you to go Global within minutes
33:18 - okay so the idea is you if you want to
33:20 - launch a workload in Canada in the US in
33:23 - the UK wherever they have a region you
33:26 - just choose that region and you can
33:27 - launch that that's a huge Advantage than
33:30 - having a server in-house whereas the
33:32 - larger on premise on-premises they might
33:36 - only have two data centers in the US and
33:38 - that's just not sufficient okay then
33:40 - we're talking about security the cloud
33:43 - provider takes care of the physical
33:44 - security and a lot of their services by
33:47 - default are designed to be secure so
33:49 - they're less likely to have issues right
33:52 - they're gonna they're gonna try to
33:54 - enforce best practices and try to lean
33:56 - you towards something that is uh going
33:58 - to be better for your benefit fit and
34:00 - you have granular access to control
34:04 - anything you want so this is something
34:05 - you might not have if you were
34:06 - self-hosting but you can say I only want
34:09 - this particular user in my Google
34:12 - console to only be able to launch
34:14 - instances they can't shut them down
34:15 - maybe they can only choose a particular
34:17 - size and so that level of granular
34:19 - control really does make it a lot more
34:22 - secure okay
34:23 - then you have reliability so a lot of
34:26 - services will have the ability to back
34:28 - up they will have they might have
34:31 - built-in Disaster Recovery or make it
34:33 - easy to strategize for Disaster Recovery
34:35 - you could have data replication and
34:38 - fault tolerance so that is something
34:39 - that is just a lot more better than uh
34:43 - than on-premise okay there's scalability
34:45 - so the idea is that when you need more
34:47 - resources you don't have to go out and
34:49 - buy a machine you just press a button
34:52 - and now you have additional additional
34:53 - compute and if you're not using it even
34:56 - like two minutes later if you say I
34:58 - don't need this anymore you just shut it
34:59 - down and so you only have to pay for the
35:01 - duration that it runs and the idea is
35:04 - you can scale up very quickly uh so you
35:06 - know the the Your Capacity is very
35:10 - fitting to that then there's a concept
35:12 - of elastic and so scale scalable means
35:15 - you have the ability to add or remove
35:17 - machines or or compute or storage but
35:20 - elastic means that you can also automate
35:22 - that so the idea is that imagine you
35:24 - have a web app and a week goes by and
35:27 - you know the weekend's coming up it's
35:28 - Black Friday so you know there's going
35:30 - to be a lot of sales and so you might
35:32 - not be around to provision enough
35:34 - machines you might not know how many
35:36 - machines to provision for that event but
35:38 - uh with uh the cloud you can automate it
35:41 - so it'll just say okay you have a lot
35:43 - more capacity now we'll just do it for
35:45 - you we'll spin it up to meet whatever
35:46 - that demand is and when people stop
35:48 - using it we'll we'll scale down the
35:50 - machines for you we'll just get rid of
35:51 - them for you okay
35:52 - and the last Point here is that the
35:55 - cloud is always current so the idea is
35:57 - you have all this underlying hardware
35:58 - and it has to be patched it has to be
36:01 - upgraded there's always new technologies
36:02 - coming out and that stuff is being
36:04 - swapped out all the time by the cloud
36:07 - provider and they're experts at it right
36:08 - whereas if you bought a physical machine
36:10 - you're going to hold on to it for like
36:12 - 10 years but they might be switching out
36:13 - machines every year okay so you're going
36:15 - to have uh you know the Best in Class
36:18 - Hardware underlying okay or access to
36:20 - things okay
36:22 - foreign
36:25 - [Music]
36:26 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
36:28 - and we're going to take a quick look at
36:30 - the four main categories of cloud
36:33 - services that you'll find on a cloud
36:34 - service provider so a cloud provider can
36:37 - have hundreds of cloud services that are
36:39 - grouped into various types of services
36:41 - and the four most common types I like to
36:44 - call these the four core
36:46 - is and specifically for infrastructures
36:49 - of service and we'll talk about IAS in
36:51 - the next video but we have compute so
36:55 - imagine having a virtual computer that
36:57 - can run applications programs in code
36:59 - then you have storage so imagine having
37:01 - a virtual hard drive that can store
37:03 - files you have networking so imagine a
37:06 - virtual Network being able to Define
37:07 - internet connections or network
37:09 - isolations and you have databases so
37:12 - imagine a virtual database for storing
37:14 - reporting data or a database for general
37:17 - purpose web application so those are the
37:19 - four core and we're going to give them
37:21 - some additional
37:23 - attention this course around the Google
37:26 - Cloud offering because we're going to
37:28 - see them in the exam and that's usually
37:30 - what these fundamental certifications
37:31 - are testing you on okay and so for
37:34 - Google they have 60 plus cloud services
37:36 - they have fewer than the other ones but
37:39 - for them it's less about
37:41 - having a lot of services and just having
37:44 - very high quality services so it's by
37:46 - Design you know
37:48 - so when you see like Azure has 200 uh
37:51 - it's it's a little bit too much for CCP
37:54 - is like okay we're just going to make
37:55 - sure that these services are
37:56 - multi-purpose you don't have to have as
37:58 - many as these other ones okay and I just
38:01 - want to say that the term cloud
38:02 - computing can be used to refer to all
38:05 - categories even though it has compute in
38:06 - the name so you'll say and I said this I
38:10 - didn't say it up there but you know you
38:11 - might say cloud computing but you really
38:14 - mean everything right it doesn't matter
38:15 - what it is everything is cloud computing
38:17 - okay
38:18 - foreign
38:21 - [Music]
38:22 - just looking at the categories of cloud
38:25 - computing now let's take a look at the
38:27 - types of cloud computing and so we have
38:29 - this pyramid on the left hand side and
38:31 - the idea is that each type is reliant on
38:34 - the technology beneath it okay and so
38:37 - the one at the top is called software as
38:39 - a service also known as SAS and it is a
38:42 - product that is run and managed by the
38:44 - cloud service provider so you don't
38:46 - worry about how the service is
38:48 - maintained it just works remains
38:51 - available the key word here is software
38:53 - so imagine just using any old software
38:55 - but it's over the cloud on the internet
38:57 - so Salesforce Gmail Office 365 you could
39:02 - even consider Facebook or Twitter
39:03 - software as a service okay
39:06 - and these are specifically for customers
39:09 - the next layer is platform as a service
39:12 - uh also known as pass and this focuses
39:15 - on the deployment and management of your
39:17 - apps so you don't worry about
39:19 - provisioning configuring or
39:20 - understanding the hardware OS you can
39:22 - just upload your code and it will do the
39:25 - rest okay and so here we would have
39:27 - things like elastic Beanstalk on AWS
39:30 - Heroku or Google app engine and this is
39:34 - the original logo and I always love this
39:36 - logo so I use it whenever I can but the
39:39 - idea is that if you have a web
39:40 - application you just want to deploy it
39:42 - and just focus on your code that's what
39:44 - a pass is and this is specifically for
39:46 - developers and then on the bottom we
39:48 - have infrastructure as a service iaas
39:51 - there's no easy way to say say this as
39:54 - one word but this is the basic building
39:56 - blocks of cloud it provides access to
39:59 - networking features computers and data
40:02 - storage space so you do not worry about
40:05 - the IT staff the data center and the
40:07 - hardware and for this we have Microsoft
40:10 - Azure AWS
40:13 - for Google cloud and this is
40:15 - specifically for admins and basically
40:17 - when we talk about a cloud service
40:18 - provider one of the key components or
40:21 - characteristics of a closet service
40:23 - provider is that they have an
40:24 - infrastructure as a service offering if
40:26 - they don't have that we don't usually
40:28 - call them a cloud service provider we
40:31 - just call them a cloud platform and
40:33 - Google Cloud originally was a cloud
40:36 - platform you didn't have iaas offerings
40:38 - and so that's probably where the origin
40:40 - of the name comes from okay
40:42 - foreign
40:45 - [Music]
40:47 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
40:49 - and we are looking at the Shared
40:50 - responsibility model and this is a
40:52 - simple visualization that helps you
40:53 - determine what the customer is
40:55 - responsible for and what Google is
40:57 - responsible for related to the Google
40:59 - Cloud platform and every cloud service
41:02 - provider has one of these models they
41:04 - vary generally the categories are
41:06 - different they just break them down
41:07 - slightly different but generally they're
41:08 - all the same so we're going to spend a
41:10 - little bit extra time with the shared
41:12 - responsibility model just because it
41:15 - does show up on the exam and it's a very
41:17 - important concept so I just want to make
41:18 - sure that you know it crystal clear and
41:20 - from all angles okay so generally these
41:23 - things are broken down into different
41:25 - categories so we have infrastructure as
41:27 - a service platform as a service software
41:28 - as a service the types of cloud
41:30 - computing and then we have along the
41:33 - side a bunch of categories of
41:35 - responsibilities and this again these
41:37 - are Google specific ones so you have
41:39 - content access policies usage deployment
41:41 - web app security identity operations
41:44 - access and authentication network
41:46 - security guest OS us data and its
41:48 - content audit logging networking storage
41:51 - and encryption Hardware kernel IPC it's
41:54 - an inter protocol something something it
41:56 - doesn't matter but it's just something
41:58 - the level the boot hardware and so the
42:01 - idea is that you have things that are
42:03 - Google responsible and things that
42:04 - you're responsible for so for a software
42:06 - it's a service and notice how much blue
42:08 - there is you have the least
42:10 - responsibility which is great because
42:12 - then you can just focus on fewer things
42:14 - but remember SAS is something like
42:16 - Microsoft Word so imagine what you could
42:18 - put in Microsoft Word you'd write your
42:20 - article right that's the content you
42:22 - might share it with somebody and you're
42:23 - just using the platform so that's SAS
42:26 - then you have platform as a service
42:27 - remember this is like something like app
42:30 - engine where you have your web
42:31 - application you built it Ruby on Rails
42:33 - larvarell next.js whatever you want you
42:35 - deploy it you upload your code so that's
42:38 - the content itself and you you have to
42:40 - choose how you want to deploy it and
42:42 - you're responsible for the security of
42:44 - that application because you're the one
42:45 - who built it right
42:46 - um so there's that there's
42:48 - infrastructure as a service this is the
42:49 - basic building blocks the idea here is
42:52 - you can launch a virtual machine and so
42:54 - if you do that then you are responsible
42:56 - for the guest OS so you're actually
42:58 - adjusting OS layer stuff and then
43:00 - everything under uh underneath is
43:03 - um is Google's responsibility so the
43:06 - customer is responsible for the data and
43:07 - the configuration of access controls
43:09 - that reside in gcp the customer is
43:11 - responsible for the configuration of
43:13 - cloud services and granting access via
43:15 - permissions notice I keep using the word
43:17 - configuration I highlighted in red this
43:19 - is to help you remember if you can
43:21 - configure it you're responsible for it
43:23 - Google is generally responsible for the
43:25 - underlying infrastructure so it's the
43:26 - hardware
43:27 - this is a concept from AWS I wish all of
43:30 - them would use it but the idea is
43:32 - there's in the cloud and of the cloud so
43:34 - in the cloud is talking about you the
43:35 - customer if you can configure or store
43:38 - it the customer then you are responsible
43:40 - for it and of the cloud is if you cannot
43:43 - configure it then Google is generally
43:45 - the one that is going to be responsible
43:46 - for it okay
43:48 - [Music]
43:53 - so now that we've looked at the Google's
43:55 - shared responsibility model let's take
43:57 - uh something like compute and compare it
43:59 - across different types of cloud
44:02 - computing so we can understand and
44:04 - practice uh you know what we would be
44:06 - responsible for or not responsible for
44:09 - so we have infrastructure as a service
44:11 - platform as a service software as a
44:12 - service and notice we have another one
44:15 - here called function as a service you
44:17 - don't usually see these in the shared
44:19 - responsibility model and it is a type of
44:21 - cloud computing but it's kind of a bit
44:23 - of a hybrid okay so it's kind of an edge
44:26 - case and it's going to just help us
44:27 - understand some of the caveats and how
44:29 - these models are a little bit flawed
44:31 - okay
44:32 - so starting at the the bare bottom where
44:34 - we have the most responsibility is with
44:36 - bare metal and so bare metal
44:39 - um just means that uh it's a physical
44:42 - machine and you're basically responsible
44:43 - for everything else you just want the
44:46 - the cloud service provider to take care
44:47 - of the hardware for you so you have
44:49 - control over the host the host operating
44:52 - system so literally what's going to be
44:54 - installed on the uh at the lowest level
44:56 - and so at this level that means you can
44:58 - control the hypervisor if you want to
45:00 - install some type of different kind of
45:01 - virtualization or have no virtualization
45:03 - all it's all up to you and so you are
45:06 - the most responsible this layer then you
45:08 - have VMS virtual machines and so this
45:12 - would be compute engine I wrote compute
45:14 - engine here because I'm not really sure
45:15 - what the offering is for bare metal bare
45:17 - metal is expensive so that's just why
45:18 - okay but for uh virtual machines uh here
45:21 - the idea is you're responsible for the
45:24 - guest OS configuration level that's the
45:26 - OS that is running when you have
45:28 - um you know a sub machine running on top
45:31 - of the hypervisor you can also install a
45:33 - container runtime and so when you think
45:35 - of
45:37 - and technically uh technically this is a
45:39 - little bit of an odd one because for
45:42 - Google you can actually check box on and
45:44 - say I want this virtual machine to have
45:46 - containerization so technically
45:48 - technically this would be Google's
45:52 - responsibility but if you wanted to you
45:53 - could install your own container runtime
45:56 - okay and so uh here we see Google is
45:59 - responsible for the hypervisor and the
46:01 - physical machine all right
46:03 - looking at containers and we have a few
46:06 - different options here but we'll talk
46:07 - about Google kubernetes engine gke and
46:11 - the idea here is that you are not
46:13 - worrying about the OS anymore you're
46:15 - configuring your containers and you're
46:17 - worried about the deployment of the
46:18 - containers and the storage of your
46:19 - containers so Google's taking care of
46:21 - the the OS if there's a hypervisor a
46:24 - hypervisor and if there's a and the
46:26 - container runtime so they're doing a lot
46:28 - of stuff there and so you're getting
46:30 - less and less responsibility then you
46:32 - have platform as a service so this would
46:35 - be a managed platform like app engine
46:37 - and so here you're just uploading your
46:39 - code you're say you have some
46:41 - configuration of the environment you
46:42 - have to choose the type of deployment
46:45 - strategy you want you have to configure
46:47 - any Associated services but Google is
46:49 - going to be responsible for the server
46:51 - the OS the networking the storage the
46:53 - security a lot more stuff okay
46:56 - then you have software as a service
46:58 - there's not a lot of SAS products on
47:01 - Google Cloud but like we'll just pull it
47:02 - from the Google workspace or G Suite
47:04 - like Google Docs and so here you're just
47:06 - worried about the contents of the
47:08 - documents the management of files the
47:10 - configuration of sharing access controls
47:13 - and Google is just responsible for the
47:15 - server the OS Network the Storage
47:16 - security
47:17 - uh deployments other like more more
47:20 - stuff than platform of service then you
47:22 - have function as a service and this
47:23 - one's a bit of an oddball because uh
47:26 - here
47:27 - it is this serverless compute okay Cloud
47:30 - function is a serverless but you upload
47:32 - your code sounds a lot like platform as
47:33 - a service but you don't have to worry
47:35 - about deployments about scaling anything
47:38 - else it takes care of everything so
47:40 - deployment container runtime networking
47:42 - Storage security physical machine uh you
47:45 - know every everything okay there's
47:47 - another service I don't have it on here
47:49 - but it's called
47:51 - um it's called Uh Cloud run and that is
47:54 - a serverless container and so that's
47:56 - where you have it and it's it's
47:58 - technically containers it's technically
48:00 - server serverless so it kind of like
48:02 - fits fits in the middle so I'm just
48:04 - saying that there's some variation there
48:05 - the exam is not going to be that hard to
48:07 - figure out what these are but I just
48:09 - want you to know that there is some
48:10 - caveats or variations to this stuff okay
48:13 - it's not clear cut as you might think it
48:15 - is
48:16 - just to give a better visual here we'll
48:18 - just go across bare metal dedicated host
48:20 - virtual machines container functions
48:23 - we didn't cover this I just didn't have
48:24 - room but there was sole tenant node
48:27 - because when you have a virtual machine
48:29 - right a virtual machine can either be
48:31 - single tenant or multi-tenant and so
48:34 - what that means is that when it's
48:36 - multi-tenant and that's the whole
48:38 - advantage of cloud is that you have the
48:40 - same you have multiple customers using
48:42 - the same physical machine but you're
48:44 - virtually isolated using having your own
48:46 - virtual machines but if you wanted to
48:48 - have the entire physical machine you
48:51 - could have a sole tenant node so you're
48:53 - the only person on that physical machine
48:54 - with those virtual machines and so
48:56 - that's something that's in between Bare
48:57 - Metal and virtual machine okay
49:00 - so just looking at the responsibility of
49:03 - the customer level of control like look
49:05 - at code here so code you're responsible
49:07 - across the board for app containers it's
49:09 - up to the containers it functions you
49:11 - you're not responsible for it for the
49:13 - run time you have control over that in
49:15 - containers right if you want to run Ruby
49:17 - you can just make a ruby Docker file and
49:20 - upload it now you can run Ruby code you
49:22 - know if they didn't support it for the
49:24 - operating system you have control the
49:26 - guest OS here for virtual machines for
49:29 - the dedicated hosts it's still guest OS
49:31 - and then at the bare metal it's Hardware
49:33 - OS for virtualization if you want to
49:35 - change out the type of hypervisor or
49:38 - virtualization method only bare metal is
49:40 - going to let you do that so hopefully
49:42 - that gives you a very clear picture of
49:44 - the shared responsive model in action
49:46 - and for different types of categories
49:48 - it's going to be completely different
49:49 - okay
49:50 - [Music]
49:55 - so let's take a look at an alternate way
49:57 - of viewing the shared responsibility
49:59 - model and this is the way AWS and Azure
50:02 - does it and the reason I want to show it
50:03 - to you is because it's a lot more uh
50:06 - encompassing of everything that the
50:08 - cloud can offer you whereas the Google
50:10 - shared responsibility model is really
50:12 - focused on the application so you can
50:14 - really tell their developers right but
50:15 - it's important for you to understand the
50:17 - full scope so we have the customer and
50:19 - we have gcp so gcp is responsible for
50:22 - the hardware and the global
50:24 - infrastructure so the regions right uh
50:27 - you know like the everything that it has
50:29 - to do with regions uh the zones and
50:31 - zones is a collection of data centers
50:33 - within a region and the fault domains
50:35 - fault domains is a logical isolation
50:38 - isolation of uh Hardware that's within a
50:42 - Data Center and then there's the
50:44 - physical security of the data center
50:45 - they're responsible for that as well
50:46 - right
50:47 - then you have software so this breaks
50:51 - down to the core4 so you got your
50:52 - compute your storage your database and
50:54 - your networking now on to the customer
50:57 - side there's the configuration of
50:59 - managed services or third-party software
51:02 - so that could be platforms applications
51:04 - IAM IM is a big one that's a huge huge
51:07 - component for customer responsibility
51:09 - configuration configuration of virtual
51:11 - infrastructure and systems so operating
51:13 - systems the network firewall so I notice
51:17 - you see networking down below so we're
51:19 - talking about the actual like routers
51:22 - and switching things like this and up
51:23 - here this is like Cloud networking okay
51:25 - this is like I want to create a VPC and
51:29 - I want to have these subnets in it and I
51:31 - want to use these Cloud networking
51:33 - services but you're not really dealing
51:34 - with lower level software like setting
51:37 - up the the switch or the router or
51:39 - things like that okay then you have
51:40 - security configuration of data so uh you
51:43 - know whether to use client-side data
51:45 - encryption whether you are whether
51:47 - you're using server-side encryption
51:49 - whether you turned it on what type of
51:50 - encryption you want to use protecting
51:52 - the network traffic so whether you're
51:55 - monitoring it and put any other kinds of
51:57 - controls to say okay who's allowed to
51:59 - see what and your customer data that's a
52:01 - big one okay so yeah this is basically
52:03 - the AWS
52:05 - and Azure way of looking or sorry I said
52:08 - Azure but it's more like AWS and Oracle
52:10 - Azure actually has their own way it's
52:12 - actually looks a lot more like this and
52:14 - so there's they do on-premise they put
52:16 - on-premise in the mix infrastructure as
52:18 - a service platforms service and software
52:19 - as a service and so they just break it
52:21 - down to here and these are going to look
52:23 - very very very similar to the Googles
52:25 - one so you have applications data
52:28 - runtime middleware OS virtualization
52:30 - server storage networking how menus are
52:33 - one two three four five six seven eight
52:35 - nine these almost almost match up to the
52:38 - OSI layer that's the uh like the layers
52:41 - like the application layer the
52:43 - networking layer things like that and so
52:45 - that's basically how Azure kind of does
52:47 - it but it just helps you to see the
52:49 - names in a different way so you can see
52:51 - there's still data there's no mention of
52:53 - like access controls but it's just
52:55 - assumed that if you have an application
52:56 - you're responsible for it you know
52:58 - things like that okay so hopefully that
53:00 - gives you a really clear understanding
53:01 - of the shared responsibility model
53:03 - [Music]
53:07 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
53:09 - and we are looking at the cloud
53:11 - computing deployment models this one's
53:13 - an important one it will show up in your
53:14 - exam so you want to know the difference
53:16 - starting the top here we have public
53:18 - cloud and this is where everything is
53:19 - built on the cloud service provider this
53:22 - is also known as being Cloud native so
53:24 - the idea here and I know this is an AWS
53:26 - example and we're doing gcp just didn't
53:27 - have time to make the new uh the new
53:29 - graphic here but the idea is that you
53:31 - have a virtual machine and a database
53:33 - that's sitting within subnets within a
53:35 - VPC both AWS and Google call their vpcs
53:39 - the same thing so that makes it easy
53:41 - here and everything's contained within
53:43 - the cloud series provider there's no
53:44 - cloud services outside the cloud service
53:47 - provider okay then you have private
53:49 - Cloud this is where everything is built
53:50 - on the company's data center this is
53:52 - also known as on-premise because it's on
53:55 - the premises uh where your office is and
53:58 - so here you would use something like
53:59 - openstack to have private a private
54:02 - Cloud so openstack I believe it's by
54:04 - Rackspace and the idea here is that it
54:06 - gives you a a lot of the benefits where
54:08 - like imagine you want to distribute a
54:11 - virtual machine across many machines you
54:13 - want to have granular permissions like
54:14 - IAM and things like that that's what
54:17 - private cloud is going to do for you
54:18 - then you got hybrid and hybrid cloud is
54:21 - where you are using both private and
54:23 - public cloud and you're connecting them
54:25 - right you're off offloading some of your
54:27 - private Cloud compute storage stuff to
54:30 - the public cloud and that's happening
54:32 - via some kind of hybrid connection okay
54:36 - and then we have cross Cloud also known
54:39 - as multi-cloud a lot of people will call
54:41 - it hybrid Cloud it's not hybrid Cloud
54:43 - hybrid cloud is when you have a private
54:45 - cloud and a public Cloud connected a
54:48 - cross-cloud is when you are using
54:50 - multiple multiple
54:53 - csps and the the workload is spread
54:56 - across them a really good example here
54:57 - is something like Azure Arc or for
55:01 - Google's offering they call there's
55:02 - anthos so the idea is that you have a
55:04 - control plane that will control compute
55:06 - across multiple customers providers in
55:08 - on-premise environments multi-cloud
55:11 - multiple Cloud providers or multi-cloud
55:13 - is just when you use multiple providers
55:15 - but you don't necessarily use data
55:17 - across them okay but Google is going to
55:19 - just treat multi-cloud and cross-cloud
55:21 - as the same terminology all right
55:23 - to try to just kind of give this more of
55:26 - um uh like a business use case or who's
55:30 - using these things we talk about uh for
55:33 - uh Cloud this is or public Cloud we're
55:35 - fully utilizing cloud computing this is
55:37 - where we're using cloud and on-premise
55:39 - and this is where we're deploying on
55:41 - premise using virtualization it's
55:43 - sometimes known as private Cloud okay so
55:45 - who's using cloud like public Cloud
55:47 - we're looking at startups SAS offerings
55:50 - new projects and companies so think of
55:51 - Basecamp Dropbox Squarespace for hybrid
55:55 - we have Banks fintech Investment
55:57 - Management large professional service
55:59 - providers Legacy on premise there's
56:01 - reasons why they're hybrid they have to
56:03 - keep certain data on on premise for
56:07 - regulatory reasons or it could be
56:10 - because of
56:12 - um just because they've had they have so
56:14 - much infrastructure it's just too hard
56:15 - to move everything away or they have
56:17 - customers that are concerned about the
56:19 - cloud or the public Cloud when we're
56:22 - talking about the public sector like
56:23 - government or hospitals with super
56:25 - sensitive data or very very large
56:27 - Enterprises with crazy regulation like
56:29 - insurance companies they might want to
56:31 - have a hundred percent private Cloud
56:33 - they're starting to adopt a hybrid model
56:36 - so uh we're seeing less and less of this
56:39 - but you know like hospitals AIG which is
56:41 - insurance company or the government of
56:42 - Canada okay
56:44 - [Music]
56:49 - Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are
56:51 - looking at the total cost of ownership
56:53 - also known as TCO to really understand
56:56 - what it is that uh you know we are
56:59 - paying for when we're using on premise
57:00 - and what we're paying for or not have to
57:03 - pay for when we're using gcp these break
57:05 - down to capex and Opex notice here at
57:07 - the top we're going to talk about that
57:08 - in the next slide here now Google Cloud
57:11 - doesn't actually ever mention TCO even
57:14 - though it's pretty common across all the
57:15 - other clusters providers but it does tie
57:18 - back to capex and OPEC so we're going to
57:19 - cover it anyway and it's good to know
57:21 - this okay so to understand the TCO
57:23 - concept I have these icebergs to really
57:26 - make sure or to sell you that these are
57:28 - icebergs I put some penguins and a whale
57:29 - on it for your for you the idea is that
57:32 - we have things that are above the
57:34 - surface and these are things that we
57:36 - generally think about and then the
57:37 - things below the surface under the water
57:39 - are the things that we're not thinking
57:41 - about that really helps us factor in the
57:44 - total cost of ownership so we're looking
57:47 - at things that are obvious people think
57:48 - about well well you know for on-premise
57:51 - we just have to pay for our software
57:52 - license fees right if you have um
57:55 - Microsoft servers you pay for those
57:57 - licenses and then on gcp well you just
58:00 - pay subscription fees so maybe you're
58:01 - not paying for the licenses but now
58:03 - you're just paying for uh using the
58:05 - services uh On Demand right and so they
58:08 - might look at and say well you know the
58:09 - costs aren't they look pretty comparable
58:11 - but then when you get below the surface
58:14 - we talk about because remember on
58:16 - premise you you have control you have
58:18 - those physical machines there right so
58:19 - there's the implementation the
58:21 - configuration
58:22 - the training the physical security the
58:25 - hardware the IT personnel the
58:27 - maintenance there's a lot of cost in um
58:30 - actually having those physical machines
58:33 - and all the stuff around them where as
58:36 - uh in the cloud service provider uh you
58:38 - are worried about the implementation the
58:40 - configuration training like how to use
58:42 - cloud services but you're not worried
58:44 - about all that other physical stuff and
58:46 - the idea here is that you can save up to
58:49 - 75 shifting over to a cloud service
58:52 - provider GCB doesn't have an example of
58:55 - a cost saving example but AWS does and
58:57 - they showed like 75 is going to be the
58:59 - same for all the csps and the idea now
59:02 - is all this stuff in the red here is now
59:04 - the cloud service provider's
59:06 - responsibility you don't have to worry
59:07 - about it
59:08 - so let's talk about Capital versus
59:11 - operational expenditures so Capital
59:13 - expenditures known as capex and
59:15 - operational expenditures known as Opex
59:17 - right and so on the capex side this is
59:20 - where you're spending money up front on
59:22 - physical uh infrastructure and deducting
59:25 - that expense from your tax bill over
59:27 - time so that's where a lot of people go
59:28 - well you know I can get this machine and
59:30 - then write it off uh year after year and
59:32 - I guess that sounds okay but you're
59:33 - going to save way more money way way
59:36 - more money than getting that that small
59:38 - tax benefit but let's talk about what
59:40 - are capex expenses so you have server
59:43 - server costs of the computers the
59:45 - storage costs are like hard drives
59:47 - Network costs routers cable switches
59:49 - backup and archive costs Disaster
59:52 - Recovery costs data center costs so rent
59:54 - cooling physical security the technical
59:57 - Personnel so with capital expenses you
59:59 - have to guess up front what you're going
60:01 - to plan on spending right because you're
60:03 - gonna do once you have those you're
60:05 - gonna hold on to them for a period of
60:06 - time right for operational expenditures
60:10 - the cost associated associated with the
60:12 - on-premise data center has now shifted
60:14 - to the service provider so you only have
60:16 - to worry about non-physical costs so
60:19 - this is leasing software and customizing
60:21 - features training employees and customer
60:23 - services paying for cloud support your
60:26 - billing is based on cloud metrics so
60:28 - compute usage storage usage and with
60:31 - operational expenses you can try a
60:33 - product or service without having to
60:34 - invest in the equipment so you can spend
60:37 - a lot more time in things that matter to
60:40 - grow your business and you don't have to
60:42 - immediately commit to a bunch of stuff
60:44 - you have a lot of flexibility there okay
60:46 - so that's the huge difference
60:48 - [Music]
60:52 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
60:54 - and we are looking at Cloud architecture
60:56 - terminology so these are very important
60:58 - Concepts when uh utilizing the cloud uh
61:01 - though Google will not ask you directly
61:03 - on their certification uh to describe
61:06 - these Concepts or to to to pick them out
61:09 - of a lineup of terms okay however they
61:12 - are still going to play into questions
61:13 - so we generally need to know what these
61:15 - things are so let's go through the Quick
61:17 - List here and then we'll do a bit of a
61:19 - deeper dive on each of these ones okay
61:22 - so first we have availability your
61:24 - ability to ensure a service remains
61:25 - available
61:26 - this is known as highly available ha
61:29 - you have scalability your ability to
61:30 - rapidly grow unimpeded
61:33 - you have elasticity your ability to
61:34 - shrink and grow to meet the demand and
61:36 - this has to do with the automation of it
61:38 - you have fault tolerance your ability to
61:40 - prevent a failure you have Disaster
61:41 - Recovery your ability to recover from a
61:43 - failure failure also known as being
61:45 - highly durable so Dr so looking first in
61:49 - more detail here High availability this
61:51 - is your ability for your service to
61:52 - remain available by ensuring there is no
61:54 - single point of failure or to ensure a
61:56 - certain level of performance so I got a
61:58 - bunch of text here but I have a Graphic
62:00 - that makes this really clear the idea
62:01 - here is that we have a load balancer and
62:04 - and for Googles it's called Google Cloud
62:06 - load balancing and the idea is that we
62:09 - have compute and we distribute it so
62:11 - it's separate virtual machines but they
62:13 - are in three uh different zones and the
62:17 - idea is that if you were to lose one or
62:19 - two zones you would still have a running
62:21 - service because the load balancer would
62:24 - detect that these ones are unhealthy and
62:26 - reroute the traffic to the remaining
62:28 - server okay and that helps us be be
62:31 - highly available then you have the idea
62:33 - idea of being highly scalable so your
62:36 - ability to increase your capacity based
62:37 - on the increasing demand of traffic
62:39 - memory and computing power okay
62:41 - so you have vertical scaling this is
62:43 - where you are scaling up you are
62:45 - increasing the size of the single
62:47 - machine right so maybe you are
62:49 - increasing the amount of storage the
62:51 - amount of compute things like that
62:52 - resizing the machine then you have
62:54 - horizontal scaling so you're you're just
62:56 - adding additional servers of the same
62:58 - size and then you're Distributing the
63:00 - workload across those machines okay
63:03 - you have high elasticity so your ability
63:05 - to automatically increase or decrease
63:06 - Your Capacity based on the current
63:07 - demands of traffic memory and computing
63:09 - power sounds very similar to the last
63:11 - slide but the key difference is that
63:13 - it's automated and you also have the
63:15 - ability to decrease okay so the idea
63:18 - here is that you have the constant of
63:20 - horizontal scaling where you can scale
63:22 - out but you can also scale in so scaling
63:25 - out is when you add more servers and
63:27 - scaling in is when you remove servers
63:29 - okay and generally generally speaking
63:32 - when we're doing uh uh things that are
63:35 - elastic it's usually of the same size
63:37 - there is an exception where you can have
63:38 - containers I think it's like mesos or
63:41 - whatever they allow you to have mix and
63:42 - match of different kind of containers
63:44 - but generally it's the same size
63:45 - containers okay or virtual machines I
63:47 - should say so vertical scale is
63:49 - generally hard for traditional
63:51 - architecture so you're not going to see
63:52 - the concept of elasticity with vertical
63:55 - scaling it's with horizontal scaling
63:57 - okay the way we can do
63:59 - um
63:59 - horizontal scaling or elastic automatic
64:03 - scaling is with managed instance groups
64:05 - with Google so this is automatically
64:07 - increasing or decreasing the response uh
64:09 - to a demand or a defined schedule next
64:12 - we have fault tolerance so your ability
64:14 - to uh for your service to ensure there
64:16 - is no single point of failure or
64:18 - preventing the chance of failure so I'm
64:20 - just going to lay out all this stuff
64:21 - here and so it sounds very similar to
64:23 - high availability but the idea is that
64:25 - it's all about preventing chance of
64:27 - failure so the idea is that imagine or I
64:30 - guess it's kind of the response of
64:32 - failure so the idea here is that let's
64:34 - imagine you have a database and the
64:37 - primary database for whatever reason
64:39 - fails okay and so the idea is that your
64:44 - Cloud DNS which is at the like your
64:46 - domain level what it can do is say Okay
64:48 - fail over to the secondary instance so
64:52 - you have a redundant application running
64:54 - you're syncing that data over it's a
64:56 - standby service the idea is that it's
64:58 - ready to take over when the first one
65:00 - fails okay
65:02 - so whether something happens we can
65:04 - fault over to it I know it gets
65:06 - confusing with high availability we have
65:08 - high durability your ability to recover
65:10 - from a disaster and to prevent the loss
65:13 - of data so solutions that recover from a
65:15 - disaster is known as Disaster Recovery
65:17 - how do you back up your data how fast
65:19 - can you restore that backup does your
65:21 - backup still work how do you ensure your
65:24 - current live data is not corrupt so
65:26 - there you go that is our terminologies
65:28 - okay
65:29 - [Music]
65:33 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
65:35 - and we are looking at the evolution of
65:36 - computing your cloud service provider
65:38 - has all of these offerings and the idea
65:40 - is that you need to choose the one that
65:42 - meets your use case a lot of times this
65:44 - all has to come around the utilization
65:46 - of space that's what we're trying to
65:47 - illustrate here in this section here and
65:49 - the trade-offs of why you might want to
65:51 - use some of these offerings okay
65:53 - for dedicated we're talking about a a
65:56 - physically a physical server wholly
65:58 - utilized by a single customer that's
66:00 - considered single tenant and for Google
66:03 - Cloud we're talking about
66:05 - single node clusters and bare metal
66:08 - machines where you have control of the
66:10 - virtualization so you can install any
66:12 - kind of hypervisor or virtualization you
66:13 - want in the system the trade-off here
66:15 - though is that you have to guess up
66:17 - front what your capacity is going to be
66:19 - and you're never going to 100 utilize
66:21 - that machine because it's going to have
66:22 - to be a bit under in case the
66:24 - utilization goes up that's you choosing
66:25 - the CPUs and the memories you're going
66:27 - to end up overpaying because you're
66:29 - you'll have under under utilized server
66:31 - it's not going to be easy to vertically
66:33 - scale it's not like you can just say
66:35 - resize it because the machine you have
66:36 - is what you have right you can't add
66:39 - more I mean I suppose they can insert
66:41 - more memory for you but that's a manual
66:43 - migration so it's very difficult
66:46 - and replacing the server is also very
66:48 - difficult okay so you're limited by the
66:51 - host operating system it's not
66:52 - virtualized so whatever is on there is
66:54 - on there and that's what your apps are
66:56 - going to have access to if you decide to
66:59 - run more than one app which is not a
67:00 - good practice for these kind of machines
67:02 - you're going to end up with a resource
67:04 - sharing we're one machine might utilize
67:06 - more than the others technically with a
67:08 - dedicated machine you have a guarantee
67:10 - of security privacy and full utility of
67:11 - the underlying resources I put an
67:13 - asterisk there because yes it's more
67:15 - secure but be uh but it's up to you to
67:18 - make sure that it's more secure so you
67:20 - have that's up to your skills of
67:22 - security right whereas if you had a
67:24 - virtual machine or anything above that
67:25 - there's more responsibility on the cloud
67:28 - service provider to just provide a
67:30 - secure machine and they can do a better
67:32 - job than you so why would you use a
67:34 - dedicated machine well maybe you're
67:35 - doing high performance Computing where
67:37 - you need these machines like very close
67:39 - together and you have to choose what
67:41 - kind of virtualization you need to have
67:43 - okay
67:44 - so then we're looking at virtual
67:46 - machines the idea here is you can run a
67:48 - machine within a machine the way that
67:50 - works is we have a hypervisor this is a
67:52 - software layer that lets you run the
67:54 - virtual machines and the idea here is
67:56 - now it's a multi-tenant you can share
67:57 - the cost of multiple customers you're
67:59 - paying for a fraction of the server
68:01 - you'll still end up overpaying for the
68:03 - other virtual machine because a virtual
68:04 - machine is just like you have to still
68:06 - say how many vcpus how much memory and
68:10 - your app is you know you don't want an
68:12 - app that uses 100 right you want to use
68:14 - exactly the amount you need but you can
68:15 - see here you know there's still going to
68:17 - be some under utilization uh you are
68:20 - limited by the guest operating system
68:21 - not but now it's virtualized so at least
68:23 - it's very easy to uh possibly migrate
68:26 - away if you choose to run more than one
68:29 - app on a virtual machine it can still
68:31 - run into resource sharing conflicts it's
68:34 - easier to export or import images for
68:36 - migration it's easier to vertically or
68:39 - horizontally scale okay and virtual
68:41 - machines are the most common and popular
68:43 - offering for compute because people are
68:45 - just very comfortable with those then
68:47 - you have containers and the idea is you
68:48 - have a virtual machine running these
68:50 - things called containers the way they do
68:52 - that is similar to a hypervisor but
68:54 - instead you have like here is a Docker
68:57 - demon so it's just a um a container a
69:00 - software layer okay to run those
69:02 - containers there's different kinds
69:03 - Docker is the most popular and the great
69:05 - thing is you can maximize the uh the the
69:07 - capacity because you can easily add new
69:11 - containers resizes containers use up the
69:13 - rest of the space it's a lot more
69:14 - flexible okay your containers will share
69:18 - the same underlying OS but they are more
69:20 - efficient than multiple VMS multiple
69:23 - apps can run side by side without being
69:25 - limited by the same OS requirements and
69:27 - not cause conflicts during resource
69:29 - sharing so containers are really good
69:31 - but you know the trade-off is there are
69:32 - a lot more work to maintain then you
69:34 - have functions
69:36 - functions go even step further and the
69:39 - idea is that you uh the the containers
69:41 - where we where we talked about that's a
69:44 - lot of work to maintain now the Clusters
69:46 - provider is taking care of those
69:48 - containers generally sometimes not it
69:50 - depends if it's serverless or not but
69:52 - the idea is that you don't even think
69:54 - about this is called serverless compute
69:55 - but you don't even think about uh the OS
69:58 - or anything you just know that what your
69:59 - runtime is you run Ruby or python or
70:02 - node and you just upload your code and
70:04 - you just say I want this to be able to
70:07 - run uh for this long and use this amount
70:10 - of memory okay you're only responsible
70:12 - for your code and data nothing else it's
70:14 - very cost effective you only pay for the
70:16 - time the code is running and VMS only
70:19 - run when there is code to be executed
70:21 - but because of that there is this
70:22 - concept of cold starts and this is where
70:25 - the virtual machine has to spin up and
70:28 - so sometimes requests can be a bit slow
70:29 - so there's a bit of trade-off there but
70:31 - functions or serverless compute is
70:33 - generally one of the best offerings as
70:34 - of today but more most people are still
70:37 - getting kind of comfortable with that
70:38 - Paradigm okay
70:38 - [Music]
70:43 - this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and
70:45 - we are taking a look at Global
70:46 - infrastructure so what is global
70:48 - infrastructure well it refers to the
70:50 - global presence of data centers
70:51 - networking and Cloud resources available
70:54 - to the customer and so just kind of some
70:57 - of the stats that Google cloud has they
70:59 - have 25 regions 76 zones 144 Network
71:03 - Edge locations operating in 200 plus
71:06 - countries so just an idea like here is
71:08 - an example of the exterior of a Google
71:10 - Data Center and this is an interior so
71:12 - we're going to go and dive deep on all
71:14 - these Cloud infrastructure Concepts
71:16 - starting now
71:17 - [Music]
71:21 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
71:23 - and we are looking at regions for Global
71:25 - infrastructure so regions are
71:27 - independent Geographic areas that
71:28 - consist of zones
71:29 - and gcp has 25 regions so here we have a
71:33 - map and you're going to notice that some
71:34 - are blue and some are white
71:36 - white ones indicate that they are
71:39 - planning to have regions there in the
71:42 - future in the next three years and I
71:44 - think most of most of not all of their
71:46 - regions always have three zones in them
71:49 - so that's pretty good on them so for the
71:52 - Americas we've got Oregon Los Angeles
71:54 - Salt Lake City Las Vegas Iowa South
71:57 - Carolina North Virginia Montreal Sao
72:00 - Paulo for Europe we have London Belgium
72:03 - Netherlands Zurich Frankfurt Finland
72:05 - Warsaw in Asia Pacific we have Mumbai
72:09 - Singapore Jakarta Hong Kong Taiwan Tokyo
72:14 - Osaka Sydney and Seoul okay so there's
72:18 - quite a few of them uh I mean like a lot
72:21 - of people are used to running in U.S
72:22 - West or U.S east I'm always running in
72:25 - the Canada region because that's where
72:26 - I'm from so it's there but yeah when you
72:29 - actually want to go user region it's as
72:31 - simple as choosing it so if I'm
72:32 - launching a virtual machine with compute
72:35 - instance their compute engine you're
72:38 - just going to choose the region you want
72:39 - to go in okay
72:41 - [Music]
72:45 - this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and
72:47 - we are looking at Google Cloud's Global
72:49 - infrastructure Edge Network and so Edge
72:52 - networking is the practice of having
72:54 - compute and data storage resources as
72:56 - close as possible to the end user in
72:58 - order to deliver the lowest latency and
73:01 - to save bandwidth and so we're talking
73:03 - about Edge networking we're always
73:04 - talking about points of presence pop or
73:07 - pops and this is an intermediate
73:09 - location between a gcp region and the
73:12 - end user and this location could be even
73:14 - in a third-party data center or it might
73:17 - just be described as a collection of
73:18 - Hardware so maybe it's not even a data
73:20 - center at all and so here is the big old
73:22 - graphic that um
73:24 - that Google has for us and if you see
73:26 - all those wires that's basically it's
73:28 - just showing how things are
73:30 - interconnected the actual Global Network
73:32 - between these pops and actually there's
73:34 - three types of
73:36 - um of Pops or things we want to look at
73:38 - for Edge networking at networking
73:40 - devices or things and this graphic will
73:42 - change for all three this one is I think
73:44 - for Edge pops so just understand that
73:46 - it's not represented of all these three
73:47 - types but the first is Edge pop so a
73:50 - location where a user can quickly enter
73:52 - so Ingress the gcp network for
73:55 - Accelerated access to Cloud resources
73:57 - then you have a CDN and this is a
73:59 - location to serve so egress leave
74:02 - to lead the network for cash websites
74:05 - files assets so they load very fast for
74:07 - the end user
74:09 - then you have Cloud media Edge this is a
74:11 - location specialized for the delivery of
74:13 - media such as video content
74:15 - and so there you go
74:16 - [Music]
74:20 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
74:22 - and we are looking at zones for Google
74:24 - Cloud's Global infrastructure so a zone
74:27 - is a physical location made up of one or
74:29 - more data center and a data center is
74:31 - secure is a secured building that
74:33 - contains hundreds of thousands of
74:35 - computers and so this is an example of
74:38 - the interior of a Data Center and of
74:40 - course you probably wouldn't want to
74:41 - have a dog in there unless it's a guard
74:44 - dog protecting those machines okay so a
74:46 - region will generally contain three
74:49 - zones and I actually think Google is
74:51 - very good about that they always have
74:52 - three zones but other providers will try
74:54 - to get a foothold into new regions and
74:57 - so they might only launch with a single
74:59 - zone offering but I think gcp is good in
75:01 - this regard the reason we make mention
75:03 - of that is because when we're talking
75:04 - about high availability the only way to
75:06 - get that is when you have at least three
75:07 - zones that's the standard okay data
75:10 - centers within a region will be isolated
75:11 - from each other so different buildings
75:13 - but they will be close enough to provide
75:15 - low latency and we'll talk about the the
75:18 - interlatency the interzonealange agency
75:21 - coming in this section here so common
75:23 - practice to run at least three zones to
75:25 - remain available in case a one or two
75:28 - data centers fail okay so the way you
75:30 - choose zones within Google cloud is
75:33 - after you've chosen your region you just
75:34 - choose your Zone and sometimes you're
75:36 - choosing more than one zone okay so it's
75:37 - that simple
75:38 - [Music]
75:43 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
75:44 - and we are looking at resource scoping
75:46 - for Google Cloud's Global infrastructure
75:48 - so we were just talking about zones and
75:51 - I was saying that you can uh when you
75:53 - launch a resource sometimes you choose a
75:54 - single zone or multiple zones and that
75:56 - comes into resource scoping okay so I
75:59 - just want to talk a little bit more or
76:00 - reiterate on zones one more time so a
76:02 - zone is a deployment area for Google
76:04 - Cloud resources within a region Zone
76:06 - should be considered a single failure
76:08 - domain within a region and deploy
76:10 - redundant resources in multiple zones
76:12 - multi-zones for fault tolerance and high
76:16 - availability okay so let's now talk
76:18 - about product or resource scoping so the
76:21 - idea is you can launch a resource in a
76:24 - single zone in a single region so this
76:26 - is a zonal resource you have Regional
76:28 - resources this is where a resource
76:30 - resides in multiple zones in a single
76:32 - region you have multi-regional resource
76:35 - so resources reside across multiple
76:37 - specific zones you have a global Service
76:39 - this is where resources reside globally
76:41 - and regions and zones are abstracted
76:44 - away very common with serverless
76:46 - Services okay
76:47 - and then you have internal Services
76:49 - these are foundational Services used by
76:51 - many other services you don't interact
76:53 - with these Services directly they're
76:54 - managed by Google such as spanner
76:56 - Colossus Borg and chubby okay so the
77:00 - reason I bring this up is that you know
77:01 - I saw a question or two on the exam and
77:04 - they were using this terminology and so
77:06 - you know it just helps you to kind of
77:07 - frame that question better if you know
77:09 - resource scoping okay
77:11 - [Music]
77:16 - Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are
77:18 - looking at data residency for Google
77:20 - Cloud's Global infrastructure so what is
77:23 - data residency well it's the physical or
77:25 - geographic location of where an
77:27 - organization or Cloud resources reside
77:30 - and the reason we care about this is so
77:32 - that we can do or have compliance
77:34 - boundaries these are Regulatory
77:37 - Compliance so they're legal requirements
77:38 - by government or organization that
77:41 - describes where data and Cloud resources
77:43 - are allowed to reside so you know if
77:46 - you're working with the Canadian
77:47 - government and say we're only going to
77:49 - use your software as long as the data
77:51 - resides within Canadian data centers
77:54 - that is the idea behind the stuff so
77:57 - when you're trying to run these kind of
77:59 - workloads and you need to meet
78:00 - compliance boundaries strictly defining
78:03 - the data residency of the data and Cloud
78:04 - resources and gcp you can use something
78:07 - called assured workloads so this is a
78:10 - feature that allows you to apply very
78:11 - security controls to an environment so
78:13 - it's not just for data residency but
78:15 - that that's its primary feature so data
78:18 - residency personal data access controls
78:20 - based on attributes person uh Personnel
78:22 - support case ownership controls based on
78:25 - attributes encryption so in order to
78:28 - apply data residency you're going to use
78:30 - an organizational policy called a
78:32 - resource location restriction and choose
78:35 - the allowed region or multiple regions
78:37 - well to show up in the exam probably not
78:39 - but you know it's good to get you kind
78:42 - of exposed to Global or organizational
78:44 - policies because those kind of do show
78:46 - up on the exam okay
78:47 - foreign
78:51 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
78:53 - and we are looking at Cloud interconnect
78:55 - for Global infrastructure technically
78:57 - this is hybrid hybrid services and so
79:01 - you have this in the hybrid section but
79:03 - I like to put it in global
79:04 - infrastructure because it's just
79:06 - something that has to do with data
79:09 - centers and connecting things so that's
79:10 - why I always kind of front load it in
79:12 - this section here so Cloud interconnect
79:14 - provides direct physical connections
79:16 - between your on-premise network
79:18 - and Google's Network and so Cloud
79:20 - interconnect enables you to transfer
79:23 - large amounts of data between networks
79:25 - which can be more cost effective than
79:27 - purchasing additional bandwidth over uh
79:29 - public internet so it's a direct
79:31 - physical connection so fiber optics
79:34 - running from data center to Data Center
79:35 - okay and there are two offerings we have
79:38 - dedicated and partnered so for dedicated
79:40 - this is a direct physical connection
79:42 - between the on-premise network and
79:44 - Google's Network through a co-location
79:46 - facility we'll talk about co-location
79:48 - what that means here in a moment then
79:49 - you have a partner interconnect this is
79:53 - a direct physical connection between the
79:54 - on-premise network and Google's Network
79:57 - through a trusted third-party data
79:59 - center or provider okay so on the
80:02 - dedicated side this is between 10 to 200
80:05 - gigabytes per second and for partner
80:07 - it's between 50 megabytes per second and
80:10 - 10 gigabytes per second the reason you
80:12 - would be using a partner one is maybe
80:14 - because you just can't do dedicated
80:16 - based on your location so you have to
80:18 - work through partner or maybe it's more
80:20 - cost effective or you know or it doesn't
80:22 - meet your needs so it's just going to be
80:24 - dependent on that kind of stuff but
80:25 - generally the reason people are going
80:27 - with partners because they just can't
80:28 - get the dedicated one so what is a
80:30 - co-location facility so a co-location or
80:33 - Carrier hotel is a data center where
80:35 - equipment space and bandwidth are
80:37 - available for rental to retail customers
80:39 - so the idea is that it's a rent like a
80:42 - rental data center right and Google
80:45 - Google uh is like is uh there's ones
80:49 - that they're cool with using and so
80:51 - those it's like you have a bit more
80:53 - direct control over it so you know it
80:54 - just depends on what you want to do okay
80:57 - foreign
81:01 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
81:03 - and we are looking at Google Cloud for
81:05 - government and so the first thing I want
81:07 - to answer is what is public sector so
81:09 - public sectors include public goods and
81:12 - governmental services such as military
81:14 - law enforcement infrastructure public
81:16 - trans transit public education Health
81:20 - Care the and the government itself so
81:22 - Google Cloud can be utilized by the
81:24 - public sector organization's developing
81:26 - Cloud workloads for the public sector
81:27 - and the way Google achieves this is by
81:30 - meeting Regulatory Compliance programs
81:32 - along with specific governance and
81:34 - security controls so some compliance
81:36 - programs that would be used in public
81:38 - sector would be HIPAA for for health
81:40 - fedramp for dealing with the US the
81:43 - criminal justice information service
81:45 - it's like working with the FBI and we
81:48 - got Phipps 140 hyphen 2 and we do cover
81:51 - all these again in the course so don't
81:53 - worry about having to memorize the
81:55 - second uh let's just mention fedramp so
81:57 - this stands for federal risk and
81:59 - authorization management program wraps
82:01 - of fed wrap it's a US government-wide
82:03 - program that provides a standardized
82:05 - approach to security assessments
82:07 - authorization and continuous monitoring
82:09 - for cloud products and services so what
82:11 - is govcloud because this is something
82:13 - you hear a lot with cloud service
82:14 - providers so a CSP generally will offer
82:17 - an isolated region to run fed ramp
82:19 - workloads and gov Cloud offering in
82:22 - practice can result in degraded service
82:23 - offerings lower service availability and
82:26 - higher operational costs so GC gcp has
82:29 - an alternate to offering gov Cloud where
82:31 - fedramp workloads are authorized in
82:33 - gcp's usual region data centers and this
82:37 - game mitigates the disadvantages of gov
82:39 - Cloud offering so gcp regions will be
82:41 - authorized for either a high or moderate
82:43 - Baseline and so you know that was the
82:45 - thing was I was looking up gcp and I'm
82:47 - like where's the gov Cloud I couldn't
82:48 - find it and so they just have a a
82:50 - different way of going about it and
82:52 - supposedly they say that it is better I
82:54 - don't know all the details about it but
82:56 - that was what I could drum up will the
82:58 - show up in the exam probably not I
83:00 - didn't really to see anything for public
83:02 - sector on the exam but from fundamental
83:04 - information you should absolutely know
83:06 - this okay
83:06 - [Music]
83:11 - this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and
83:13 - we are looking at latencies for Google
83:14 - Cloud's Global infrastructure so what is
83:17 - latency well latency is the time delay
83:18 - between two physical systems and what is
83:21 - lag well lag is the noticeable delay
83:23 - between the actions of input and the
83:26 - reactions of the server sent back to the
83:29 - client all right and you probably if you
83:32 - play video games you know what game lag
83:34 - is so it's basically the same thing okay
83:36 - it's just between servers instead of
83:38 - Game servers all right we have
83:40 - inter-regional latency so this is
83:42 - latency between two regions and then we
83:45 - have enter zonal latency this is latency
83:47 - between zones residing in a single
83:49 - region and I just want to generally give
83:51 - you an idea of the the latency in
83:54 - milliseconds this isn't going to be
83:56 - exact because I honestly couldn't find
83:58 - something definitive by Google and there
84:00 - are benchmarks out there and they vary
84:02 - because it's going to be between regions
84:03 - and different zones but I want to kind
84:06 - of give you kind of a bit of a de facto
84:08 - way of understanding generally what
84:10 - they'll be and so I would imagine that
84:12 - between two zones or sorry two regions
84:14 - you could see the worst case of 500
84:16 - milliseconds so that's in the triple
84:18 - digit and then when we're talking about
84:19 - interzone latency maybe 10 50
84:21 - milliseconds so double digit
84:24 - milliseconds Okay the reason this is
84:26 - important is because I saw a question on
84:29 - the exam and it actually asked about 10
84:32 - milliseconds and it was talking about a
84:34 - high availability and if you're new if
84:37 - you knew that um that it's in the double
84:39 - digit between intersonal stuff you
84:41 - wouldn't have chose multi-region you
84:43 - would only choose a single region with
84:46 - um multiple zones okay so don't get hung
84:49 - up on so much the exact number but just
84:51 - understand triple digit double digit for
84:53 - these two okay
84:56 - foreign
84:59 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
85:01 - and we are taking a look at Innovation
85:03 - waves actually known as chondra T waves
85:06 - that's a Russian name so I'm sorry if I
85:08 - pronounced it incorrectly but they are
85:09 - hypothesized cycle-like phenomenons in
85:12 - the global World economy the phenomenon
85:14 - is closely connected with technology
85:16 - life cycles so the idea here is that we
85:19 - have these waves that uh irreversibly
85:21 - change the society on a global uh scale
85:24 - and generally we underpin these for
85:26 - particular technological advancements
85:28 - okay so here we have the steam engine
85:30 - and cotton we have Railway Railway and
85:33 - steel we have electrical engineering and
85:36 - chemistry Innovations here we have
85:38 - petrochemicals and Automobiles we have
85:40 - information technology and the idea here
85:42 - is that Google is suggesting that uh the
85:44 - the wave that we're in right now
85:46 - includes Cloud technology as one of the
85:49 - larger factors when we look at one of
85:51 - these waves in a greater detail there is
85:53 - a common pattern to the wave that
85:55 - changes the supply and demand and so
85:57 - they say there's an expansion of boom a
86:00 - recession and a depression and if you
86:01 - can detect that pattern that's how you
86:03 - know that something is going on okay and
86:06 - so if we are in um if Cloud technology
86:09 - is the case here then we're definitely
86:11 - in an expansion phase right now uh and
86:14 - it's we might be in a boom it's hard to
86:16 - say
86:17 - um but uh yeah so there you go
86:19 - [Music]
86:23 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
86:25 - and we are looking at the concept of a
86:27 - burning platform so the term is used
86:29 - when a company abandons old technology
86:32 - for new technology with the uncertainty
86:34 - of success and can be motivated by fear
86:37 - that the organization's future survival
86:39 - hinges on its digital transformation so
86:42 - this idea is comes back to the oil
86:45 - industry where you would have a platform
86:47 - and oil would catch fire and so the only
86:50 - way to survive would be to abandon or
86:53 - jump off the platform and so this term
86:56 - this term is not so popular today but
86:59 - Google seems to still be using it but
87:01 - the idea is that uh you know it's just
87:03 - you have to take a leap of faith into
87:06 - this stuff if you want to keep up okay
87:08 - foreign
87:13 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
87:15 - and we are looking at the evolution of
87:17 - computing power so computing power is
87:19 - the throughput measured at which a
87:21 - computer can complete a computational
87:23 - task and Google has a variety of
87:26 - offerings for the Innovations in this
87:28 - particular field the one that we're all
87:31 - most common with are CPUs so this is
87:33 - just like what's in your computer your
87:34 - laptop when we're talking about cloud
87:36 - computing the one that we commonly see
87:38 - are Xeon CPU processors because they're
87:41 - very very uh good processors and so the
87:44 - offering here at any cloud service
87:46 - provider would be via virtual machines
87:49 - and so for Google their virtual machines
87:51 - are offered via compute engine then
87:54 - we're looking at tensor Computing so
87:56 - Google created their own machine
87:59 - learning deep learning framework called
88:01 - tensorflow and it has a new type of data
88:04 - structure called a tensor that is
88:06 - specifically optimized for you know
88:08 - neural networks and the idea here is
88:10 - that Google decided to create a piece of
88:12 - hardware that is specifically designed
88:15 - for their tensor data structure and so
88:19 - that's what they have which is this TPU
88:20 - thing and for this particular use case
88:22 - is 50 times faster than a traditional
88:25 - CPU all right and this is really for the
88:28 - space of neural Nets if you want to have
88:31 - this offering on uh Google Cloud you'd
88:34 - be using the cloud TPU okay
88:37 - and the last one here is quantum
88:38 - Computing and so Quantum Computing is
88:41 - interesting because it has the potential
88:43 - to be a hundred million times faster it
88:45 - is uh we're literally using parallel
88:48 - parallel uh a universe or Dimension uh
88:52 - using things like quantum entanglement
88:54 - very advanced concepts in order to
88:56 - perform uh insane amount of computation
88:59 - but this field is very early days and so
89:02 - being able to apply it is not very easy
89:06 - but that doesn't mean that you can't
89:07 - play around with it Google has an
89:10 - offering AWS has an offering for this
89:12 - but in particular Google has been
89:15 - producing uh different Hardware so the
89:18 - first had foxtail in 2016 then Bristol
89:20 - cone in 2017 and I think the latest one
89:23 - they have is uh Sycamore in 2018 all
89:27 - right and so this is all accessible via
89:29 - the Google Quantum AI all right
89:31 - foreign
89:36 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
89:38 - and we are looking at the concept of
89:40 - digital transformation and this is the
89:41 - adoption of digital technology to
89:43 - transform services or businesses through
89:45 - replacing non-digital or manual
89:48 - processes with digital processes like
89:50 - going paperless or replacing older
89:52 - digital technology with newer digital
89:54 - technology so that means you previously
89:57 - are using on premise and you're moving
89:58 - into a hybrid architecture or using uh
90:01 - Cloud native technology all right and so
90:04 - uh this you could describe is that
90:07 - Google has their own Google digital
90:09 - transformation framework or concept
90:11 - based off of Google 7 solution pillars
90:14 - so we have infrastructure modernization
90:16 - business application platform portfolio
90:18 - application modernization database and
90:22 - Storage Solutions smart analytics
90:24 - artificial intelligence and security so
90:27 - in terms of the actual exam they're not
90:30 - going to ask you what are the Seven
90:31 - Pillars or what digital transformation
90:33 - is but you know the exam is all um uh
90:37 - business use case scenario so there are
90:39 - some tidbits in here which might help
90:40 - you with some of the questions and
90:41 - that's why we're going to go through all
90:43 - the pillars okay
90:44 - [Music]
90:48 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
90:50 - and we are taking a look here at Google
90:52 - Cloud's solution pillars and there's
90:54 - seven in total here and there's a lot of
90:56 - text so let's work our way through it so
90:59 - the first is infrastructure
91:00 - modernization so replacing Legacy
91:02 - hardware and software systems with Cloud
91:05 - Solutions allows organizations to adopt
91:07 - hybrid architectures and have more
91:09 - infrastructure Mobility choosing a mix
91:11 - of best cloud service provider offerings
91:13 - for their organizational's use case so
91:15 - in this case if we're talking about
91:17 - hybrid architectures one service that we
91:20 - could utilize would be anthos and this
91:21 - allows you to manage compute from both
91:23 - on-premise and public cloud in a single
91:25 - unified interface moving on to business
91:28 - applications platform portfolio so the
91:31 - backbone of csps are built on top of
91:34 - robust well-documented apis standardized
91:36 - across all offered cloud services
91:38 - organizations can focus on the
91:40 - configuration interconnections of
91:42 - various systems instead of having to
91:44 - build their own systems so what are they
91:46 - talking about here we're talking about
91:47 - Cloud SDK a cloud API Cloud CLI and the
91:51 - Google Cloud documentation for number
91:54 - three we have application modernization
91:56 - so building web applications on top of
91:58 - cloud services allows organizations to
92:01 - globally deliver and rapidly iterate
92:03 - faster than ever before csps offer
92:06 - automated deployment pipelines AI
92:08 - powered code reviews easy staging and
92:10 - testing of new features the ability to
92:12 - test in production rollback changes apps
92:14 - are more durable and can remain
92:15 - available when facing catastrophic
92:18 - Regional failure so one thing that makes
92:21 - it really easy to build up very robust
92:24 - web apps is if you're able to migrate
92:25 - your web app over to app engine because
92:27 - it just takes care of a lot of the stuff
92:29 - for you and all you got to do is upload
92:31 - your code and do some configuration make
92:33 - some choices but more or less it makes
92:35 - it very highly durable available and
92:37 - scalable then you have database and
92:39 - Storage Solutions so most companies can
92:41 - tolerate losing application code you can
92:43 - always write you can always write losing
92:46 - data is not something you can recover
92:48 - over cloud service providers have
92:50 - guaranteed slas of data durability as
92:53 - well as the ability to easily migrate
92:54 - and secure your data so in this case if
92:58 - we're looking at cloud storage which is
92:59 - on you know the storage or file side
93:01 - side of the the scenario here it can
93:04 - store files and documents as objects and
93:06 - its availability is 99.5 percent uh and
93:10 - they have an it's SLA backed okay and
93:12 - the way they do that is that they're
93:13 - replicating your data across multiple
93:15 - zones so if a Zone fails it'll just
93:17 - recover cover files from another Zone it
93:19 - does that automatically for you for
93:21 - number five we have Smart analytics so
93:23 - when you store data on cloud service
93:25 - providers you can tap into big data and
93:27 - business intelligence Cloud offerings
93:29 - assisted by AI to help you analyze your
93:31 - data so for Google there's looker and
93:34 - this is data exploration Discovery
93:35 - business intelligence platform acquired
93:38 - by Google and it is now part of gcp
93:40 - uh then you have artificial intelligence
93:42 - so AI deep learning ml or specialized
93:45 - domains that uh traditionally required
93:48 - scarce and expensive subject matter
93:49 - experts cloud is commoditizing uh
93:52 - commoditizing simplifying AI knowledge
93:54 - while driving costs lower for adoption
93:57 - so there's a lot of tools here that
93:59 - Google has but the the primary ones is
94:01 - vertex AI this is a unified platform for
94:03 - AIML deep learning automl they have
94:06 - their own deep learning framework
94:07 - they've developed it's really easy to
94:08 - use this is my uh most uh favorite
94:11 - framework and this is the one I always
94:13 - use then we have security so cloud
94:16 - services by default have strong
94:17 - mechanisms built in for security
94:18 - governance compliance csps are
94:21 - continually developing new and
94:22 - Innovative security offerings not just
94:24 - at a service per service level but to
94:26 - analyze recommend and remediate at the
94:28 - project and organization level you can
94:30 - easily and quickly audit and apply
94:32 - security controls to become compliant in
94:34 - a fraction of time then on an on-premise
94:36 - solution and so things you get uh when
94:39 - you're working the cloud IAM I I mean if
94:41 - you're using private Cloud I suppose
94:42 - you'd get that with openstack but I am
94:44 - so role-based access controls and user
94:46 - management one that I really like that
94:48 - Google has is beyond Corp it's a zero
94:50 - trust model framework then there's the
94:52 - security Command Center so it's a
94:54 - centralized it centralizes visibility
94:56 - control for security and stuff for
94:57 - misconfigurations but there's a lot more
95:00 - there but this is just to kind of help
95:01 - you ground each of these pillars into
95:03 - something practical okay
95:05 - [Music]
95:09 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
95:11 - and we are looking at what the Google
95:12 - Cloud console is and this is a portal
95:15 - that is a web-based unified console that
95:17 - provides an alternative to the command
95:19 - line tools it allows you to build manage
95:21 - and monitor everything from simple web
95:23 - apps to complex cloud deployments and so
95:25 - this is generally the main way you're
95:27 - going to be interacting uh with Google
95:29 - Cloud because it's the easiest way to do
95:31 - it so the idea is that you have this
95:33 - hamburger menu you can drop down and see
95:35 - all the possible Services you can also
95:37 - search for them you can organize
95:40 - different projects here and switch
95:41 - between them and in the background here
95:43 - what you can see me doing is I'm
95:44 - actually trying to launch a new compute
95:47 - engine virtual machine instance you can
95:50 - also get notifications and things like
95:52 - that but basically everything you want
95:54 - to do is via the console okay
95:56 - [Music]
96:00 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
96:02 - and we are taking a look here at Cloud
96:03 - SDK so SDK stands for software
96:06 - development kit and it is a collection
96:08 - of software development Tools in one
96:10 - installable package so you can use the
96:12 - cloud SDK to pragmatically create modify
96:14 - delete or interact with Google Cloud
96:16 - resources and the SDK is offered in a
96:19 - variety of programming languages so we
96:21 - got Java python node.js Ruby which is my
96:24 - favorite
96:25 - go.net PHP and so here is an example of
96:29 - us using the SDK with Ruby code so we've
96:31 - installed the the the package as a ruby
96:34 - Jam that's how we did it and we're
96:36 - accessing a bigquery and we're just
96:38 - iterating out that table okay
96:40 - foreign
96:45 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
96:47 - and we are taking a look at Cloud CLI so
96:50 - CLI stands for command line interface
96:51 - and what it allows you to do is process
96:53 - commands to a computer program in the
96:55 - form of lines of text and operating
96:57 - systems Implement a commandlet interface
96:59 - in a shell or a terminal that's how
97:01 - you're going to interact with one and so
97:03 - this is what it looks like to use the
97:05 - CLI so once it's installed what you'll
97:07 - do is write gcloud and then whatever it
97:10 - is that you want to do so in this case
97:11 - we are you want to work with a compute
97:13 - engine so we write compute for SSH ssh
97:17 - into our instance and so it's just as
97:19 - simple as that okay
97:21 - [Music]
97:25 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
97:27 - and we're taking a look here at Cloud
97:29 - shell and this is a free online
97:30 - environment with a command line access
97:32 - for managing your infrastructure in an
97:35 - online code editor for cloud development
97:37 - so the idea here is these are the two
97:41 - interfaces uh they're very pretty
97:42 - similar but the idea is you'll press
97:44 - this little button here it will launch
97:46 - generally a shell and if you want to
97:48 - switch over to the editor you just press
97:49 - that
97:50 - and here you can see this is basically a
97:52 - bash terminal and this one here is a vs
97:54 - code environments there you go
97:56 - [Music]
97:59 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
98:01 - and we're looking at projects and
98:03 - folders for Google Cloud so a project in
98:05 - Google cloud is a logical grouping of
98:07 - resources and a cloud resource must
98:09 - belong to a project so up in your
98:11 - navigation you're going to see the
98:13 - project you're currently on you can drop
98:15 - that down change to another project or
98:17 - quickly and easily create additional
98:19 - projects a project is made up of
98:21 - settings permissions and other metadata
98:24 - a project can't access another Project's
98:26 - resources unless you use share VPC or
98:29 - VPC Network pairing resources within a
98:31 - single project can work together easily
98:33 - for example by communicating through
98:34 - internal Network subject to the regions
98:37 - and Zone rules each Google Cloud project
98:39 - has the following a project name which
98:42 - you provide a project ID which you can
98:44 - provide or Google Cloud can provide for
98:46 - you a project number which Google Cloud
98:48 - provides as you work with Google Cloud
98:50 - you'll use these identifiers in certain
98:53 - command lines and API calls so each
98:55 - project at D is unique across Google
98:57 - Cloud once you have created a project
98:59 - you can delete the project but its IDs
99:01 - can never be used again when billing is
99:03 - enabled each project is associated with
99:05 - one billing account multiple projects
99:07 - can have their resources usage build to
99:09 - the same account a project serves as a
99:12 - namespace this means that every resource
99:14 - within each project must have a unique
99:15 - name but you can usually reuse resource
99:18 - names if they're if they're in separated
99:20 - projects then there's the concept of
99:22 - folder so folders allow you to logically
99:24 - group multiple projects that share
99:26 - common IAM permissions folders are
99:29 - commonly used to isolate projects for
99:30 - different departments or for different
99:32 - environments we'll see more of this when
99:34 - we cover resource hierarchies okay
99:37 - foreign
99:41 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
99:43 - and we're looking at the Google Cloud
99:44 - adoption framework also known as gcaf
99:47 - and this is a white paper that can
99:49 - determine an organization's Readiness to
99:51 - adopt Google Cloud as well as providing
99:54 - steps to fill in knowledge gaps and
99:56 - develop new competencies okay so to
99:59 - really understand the Google Cloud
100:01 - adoption framework we need to know what
100:03 - is a white paper so it is a report or
100:06 - guide that informs readers concisely
100:08 - about a complex issue it is intended to
100:11 - help readers understand an issue solve a
100:13 - problem or make a decision and white
100:15 - papers are generally PDF format but they
100:18 - could also be in HTML format as well so
100:21 - white papers are common among all the
100:23 - cloud service providers and they're
100:25 - almost always an essential to study at
100:28 - the fundamentals level and so for the
100:31 - Google Cloud digital leader I recommend
100:34 - going through the cloud adoption
100:35 - framework which is what we're going to
100:36 - do here okay so the gcap is composed of
100:39 - four themes through maturity phases the
100:42 - cloud maturity scale epics and programs
100:45 - so let's get into it
100:46 - [Music]
100:51 - this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and
100:53 - we are looking at themes for the Google
100:54 - Cloud adoption framework so themes are
100:56 - just four different areas that your
100:59 - company needs to excel in in order to be
101:01 - successful with their Cloud adoption so
101:03 - starting at the first here we have learn
101:05 - the quality and scale of the learning
101:06 - programs you have in place to upskill
101:08 - your technical teams your ability to
101:10 - augment your IT staff with experienced
101:12 - Partners so who's engaged how widespread
101:14 - is an engagement how concerted is the
101:16 - effort how effective are the results
101:18 - number two here is lead so the extent to
101:21 - which it teams are supported by a
101:23 - mandate from leadership to migrate to
101:24 - Cloud the degree to which the teams
101:26 - themselves are cross-functional
101:27 - collaborative and self-motivated so how
101:30 - are teams structured have they got
101:32 - executive sponsorship how are Cloud
101:34 - projects budgeted governed and assessed
101:36 - the third theme Here is scale so the
101:38 - extent to which you use cloud native
101:40 - services that reduce operational
101:42 - overhead and automate manual processes
101:44 - and policies so how are cloud-based
101:47 - Services provisioned how is capacity for
101:49 - work workloads allocated it how are
101:52 - applications up updates manage and for
101:55 - the fourth one here we have secure so
101:57 - the capabilities to protect your
101:59 - services from unauthorized and
102:00 - inappropriate access with a
102:02 - multi-layered identity Centric security
102:04 - model dependent also on the advanced
102:08 - maturity of the other three themes okay
102:10 - so what controls are in place what
102:13 - technologies used what strategies govern
102:15 - uh everything as a whole okay
102:17 - [Music]
102:21 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
102:23 - and we are looking at phases for the
102:25 - Google Cloud adoption framework and this
102:27 - is all about the maturity of the
102:28 - organization because depending on where
102:30 - you are is going to determine the type
102:33 - of action or advice here based on the
102:36 - phase okay so for tactical this is
102:39 - short-term goals which is individual
102:42 - workloads are in place but there is no
102:43 - coherent plan the focus is on reducing
102:45 - the cost of discrete systems getting to
102:48 - the cloud with minimal disruption the
102:50 - wins are quick but there is no provision
102:52 - for scale so really they're just trying
102:54 - to utilize anything and it's not there's
102:56 - no real plan in place okay for strategic
102:59 - this is where you are in the midterm of
103:03 - maturity so a broader Vision governs
103:05 - individual workloads which are designed
103:06 - and developed with an eye to Future
103:08 - needs and scale have begun to embrace
103:11 - change people and processes are not now
103:13 - involved in the adoption strategy it
103:15 - teams are both efficient and effective
103:17 - increasing the value of harnessing the
103:19 - cloud for your business operations then
103:22 - we have a transfer uh transfer
103:25 - transformative or transformationals
103:27 - there we go and so this is like
103:29 - long-term goals so Cloud operations are
103:31 - functioning smoothly so you're in the
103:32 - cloud now but you're focusing on
103:34 - integrating the data and insights
103:36 - working in the cloud so existing data is
103:38 - transparently shared new data is
103:40 - collected and analyzed predictive and
103:42 - prescriptive analytics via machine
103:43 - learning is used people in processes are
103:46 - being transformed which further supports
103:48 - technological changes it is no longer a
103:52 - cost center but has become instead a
103:53 - partner to the business
103:55 - [Music]
103:59 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
104:01 - and we are looking at the cloud maturity
104:03 - scale for the Google Cloud adoption
104:04 - framework and so this is a matrix made
104:06 - up of the themes and phases that we just
104:08 - reviewed and it will help your
104:10 - organization pinpoint their exact
104:11 - adoption position so uh on the
104:14 - horizontal scale we have learn lead
104:16 - scale and secure to determine our
104:18 - adoption themes and then on our vertical
104:20 - scale we have tactical strategic and
104:23 - transform transformational for
104:25 - organizations maturity so where it
104:28 - intersects with learn and tactical the
104:30 - idea here is that you are self-taught
104:32 - and you are reliant on third parties for
104:36 - strategic learn these are organized
104:38 - training with third-party assisted for
104:41 - learn and transformational it's peer
104:43 - learning and sharing with third-party
104:45 - staff augmentation so just to kind of
104:48 - make sense because I know these are kind
104:49 - of abbreviated so it doesn't make a
104:51 - whole lot of sense but the idea is that
104:52 - if you are learning and you are in the
104:54 - short term phase that you're probably
104:56 - going to be self-taught in this right
104:58 - okay okay and then if you're strategic
105:01 - you're going to be you're going to have
105:02 - organized training because you are
105:03 - bringing people and processes in as we
105:05 - saw in the as we were describing the
105:08 - maturity phases and then for
105:10 - transformational we have peer learning
105:11 - and sharing because we're now
105:12 - established in the cloud but we're just
105:15 - trying to collect data make things a lot
105:16 - better okay
105:18 - for lead uh lead for tactical looks like
105:21 - it's teams by function and you have a
105:23 - heroic project manager basically anytime
105:26 - you want to adopt Cloud no matter if
105:28 - it's Google or other ones you need
105:29 - somebody and your team that's going to
105:31 - act as the hero or the Evangelist for
105:34 - that adoption uh for the adoption of the
105:36 - cloud and you've got to find that person
105:38 - to carry you through all the stages okay
105:40 - so for lead and strategic we have new
105:43 - cross-functional functional Cloud team
105:46 - so this is where you actually have a
105:48 - specialized team in your organization
105:49 - because you're now in the cloud right
105:51 - and so that's going to help support the
105:53 - workloads and move further and then uh
105:56 - down for transformational lead you have
105:58 - cross-functional feature teams great uh
106:01 - autonomy so the idea is you don't just
106:02 - have a single team but you have multiple
106:04 - teams that are feature specific so maybe
106:07 - you have data data team you have a
106:09 - devops team and the idea is that you
106:11 - also want to make sure they have the
106:13 - control to do what they need to do in
106:14 - their own space right that means in
106:16 - Google Cloud they're going to have their
106:17 - own folder her and they can self-govern
106:19 - all their projects in there they're not
106:21 - they can do their Shadow I.T and they
106:23 - don't have to access centralize it to do
106:25 - stuff for scale and tactical so change
106:28 - is slow and risk is Ops heavy because
106:32 - basically everything is still in the old
106:35 - uh the old on-premise system right so
106:37 - that makes sense for scale and strategic
106:40 - templates ensure good governance without
106:42 - manual review so you know you just want
106:45 - to make sure that you have
106:46 - infrastructure as code is in place and
106:48 - you're putting governing rules in the
106:50 - midterm for transformational scale all
106:53 - changes constant low risk and quickly
106:55 - fixed so you're really in good shape for
106:56 - scale here uh you know you're just scale
106:59 - is going to be really easy right so
107:01 - whereas this you're doing a lot of
107:02 - automation still to try to get your
107:04 - scale for secure fear of public internet
107:07 - trust and private Network that's of
107:09 - course why people are on premise because
107:10 - they're really afraid to be in the
107:12 - public cloud or or uh on third parties
107:15 - in general so that is something you're
107:17 - going to have to fight with at that
107:18 - stage for strategic you have Central
107:20 - identity hybrid Network
107:22 - you know so that could be using the
107:24 - Beyond Corp which is the zero trust
107:26 - model or you could be doing Federation
107:29 - between uh your Azure active directory
107:32 - on-prem into uh like with Cloud identity
107:35 - using like uh Google syncing directory
107:38 - service
107:39 - then the last one here is secure and
107:42 - transformational Trust only the right
107:44 - people device and services this is what
107:46 - they're talking about they're talking
107:46 - about the zero trust model here so that
107:49 - really is where Beyond Corp would come
107:51 - into play for the Google Cloud adoption
107:53 - framework okay
107:55 - [Music]
107:59 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
108:00 - and we are looking at epics for the
108:02 - Google Cloud adoption framework so when
108:04 - you've determined where your
108:06 - organization is in the adoption process
108:08 - using that cloud maturity scale then you
108:10 - need to Define epics and epics are work
108:13 - streams to scope and structure Cloud
108:15 - adoption epics are defined so they do
108:18 - not overlap they are aligned to
108:19 - manageable groups of stakeholders they
108:21 - can be further further broken down into
108:24 - individual user stories if you've ever
108:26 - done Agile development epics and user
108:28 - stories are pretty darn common and you
108:30 - can definitely use them in jira so if
108:32 - you if you line these things up that's
108:34 - what you might want to do so we have
108:36 - this Venn diagram where we have three
108:38 - areas we've got people processes and
108:40 - textures broad categories of different
108:42 - kinds of epics everything within this
108:44 - Venn diagram is going to be epics okay
108:47 - so under people we have behaviors people
108:51 - people's operation communication right
108:54 - under process we have cost control
108:56 - Incident Management instrumentation for
108:59 - Tech we have Resource Management
109:01 - networking and then we have these places
109:04 - where the intersects so we have external
109:07 - experience upskilling sponsorship
109:09 - teamwork architecture infrastructure is
109:12 - code CI CD identity and access data
109:16 - management all right so if you're
109:17 - limited for time and resources focus on
109:19 - the epics in the colored segments and
109:22 - since these align with learn lead at
109:25 - scale and secure that's what these are
109:27 - when you're seeing those four okay just
109:29 - to help that make a little bit more
109:31 - sense uh there's programs and these are
109:33 - a logical grouping of epics that
109:34 - correlate to themes to allow you to
109:36 - focus on specific adoption efforts so
109:38 - the idea is that you have
109:40 - learned which is for training programs
109:43 - change management so that would be lead
109:45 - Cloud operation models with scale a
109:48 - secure account setup which is secure and
109:50 - the idea is like okay well there's these
109:52 - epics how do I know how to write them
109:54 - out or do user stories I would imagine
109:56 - that that's where you would work with
109:58 - Google or the Google partner Network to
110:01 - find somebody that actually knows how to
110:03 - go and implement this stuff because I
110:06 - did find that the documentation was a
110:07 - bit lacking for this but I imagine that
110:09 - there are people out there that have a
110:10 - good idea how to actually utilize this
110:12 - framework okay
110:13 - [Music]
110:18 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
110:19 - and we're looking at Tams which stands
110:22 - for technical account manager and no
110:24 - matter if you're using Google Cloud
110:25 - Azure AWS they all have Tams this is a
110:28 - human resource assigned to work with
110:30 - your organization when paying for Google
110:32 - Cloud's premium support So Tam can
110:34 - assist with Google Cloud adoption
110:36 - framework by performing a high level
110:38 - assessment of your organization's Cloud
110:39 - maturity tell you how to prioritize your
110:42 - training change management programs
110:44 - partner relationships Cloud operating
110:46 - models secure account configuration so
110:48 - the idea here is that you know if you
110:50 - don't know how to apply the Google Cloud
110:52 - adoption framework you want to get a tam
110:54 - because they're really going to help you
110:55 - connect you to people that do know how
110:56 - to do it or give you a bit of a
110:58 - Kickstart into that process okay
111:00 - [Music]
111:04 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
111:06 - and we are looking at the cloud maturity
111:08 - assessment tool this is a guided form to
111:10 - assess your organizations against the
111:13 - Google Cloud's adoption framework along
111:15 - its four themes learn lead scale and
111:18 - secure so it's a simple multiple choice
111:19 - form and once you're done you'll get an
111:22 - email with your maturity phase so it's
111:24 - going to say okay for learning you're
111:27 - strategic right that's where you are
111:28 - it'll give you some additional
111:30 - information on how you compare it
111:31 - against the average uh is this tool that
111:33 - useful no not really it's not that hard
111:36 - to assess where you are but you know it
111:39 - is a good starting point if you're just
111:40 - not sure just to kind of get you warmed
111:42 - up to this framework okay
111:44 - foreign
111:47 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
111:49 - and we are looking at compute for Google
111:51 - Cloud platform and so there's a variety
111:53 - of services so let's get to it the first
111:55 - being compute engine and this one is for
111:57 - virtual machines or VMS and this is
112:00 - generally the primary or traditional
112:01 - type of compute you are going to utilize
112:04 - on a cloud service provider then there
112:07 - is bare metal so bare metal is where you
112:09 - have full control of the hardware so you
112:12 - can install any kind of hypervisor you
112:13 - want it on it or virtualization it's
112:16 - going to allow you to have very low
112:17 - latency on Google Cloud
112:19 - then we have iPad gym which is a
112:21 - platform as a service build and deploy
112:23 - apps on a fully managed highly scalable
112:25 - platform without having to manage the
112:26 - underlying infrastructure we're going to
112:28 - spend a little bit more time on app
112:29 - engine because the exam definitely pops
112:32 - up with a few questions that talk about
112:33 - its different core offerings we have
112:36 - Cloud gpus so add gpus to your workloads
112:39 - for machine learning scientific
112:40 - Computing and 3D visualization you have
112:42 - Google kubernetes engine also known as
112:44 - gke so reliably efficiently and securely
112:48 - deploy and scale containerized
112:49 - applications on kubernetes we have sole
112:52 - tenant nodes and this is known as
112:55 - dedicated virtual machines and all the
112:57 - other different providers so the reason
112:59 - you'd want to use these is you need to
113:00 - be compliance you have your own licenses
113:02 - you need to keep these instances
113:04 - physically separated with dedicated
113:06 - Hardware because maybe you know you're
113:08 - not allowed to run it with as a
113:10 - multi-tenant so there's all sorts of
113:11 - reasons for that you have Cloud
113:13 - functions these are functions as a
113:14 - service so you can create serverless
113:17 - single purpose functions that respond to
113:18 - the events I guess I could have put
113:20 - cloud run on this as well which is
113:22 - serverless containers but we have a
113:24 - container section so it's not a big deal
113:25 - we'll get to that some kind of auxiliary
113:28 - services that are used that are
113:30 - important to know or compute would be
113:32 - Google Cloud VM engine or VMware engine
113:35 - so migrate and run your VM workloads
113:37 - natively on Google Cloud you have
113:39 - migrate for compute engine so migrate
113:41 - servers and VMS from on-premise or
113:42 - another Cloud to compute engine this was
113:44 - formerly known as velostrata
113:46 - preemptable VMS so deploy affordable
113:49 - short-lived compute instances suitable
113:51 - for batch jobs and fault tolerant
113:52 - workloads we're going to cover that
113:54 - again when we go to our pricing section
113:55 - shielded VM so deploy hardened virtual
113:57 - machines on Google Cloud
113:59 - [Music]
114:03 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
114:06 - and we are taking a deeper look here at
114:08 - app engine so app engine is a platform
114:10 - as a service for your applications you
114:12 - can quickly deploy and scale web
114:14 - applications without having to worry
114:16 - about the underlying infrastructure and
114:18 - a great way of thinking of this is if
114:19 - you know Heroku it's basically the
114:21 - Heroku of gcp so the idea here is you
114:24 - can use your favorite programming
114:25 - language whether it's node.js Java Ruby
114:28 - C sharp go python or PHP you can also
114:31 - bring your own language runtime and you
114:33 - do that by creating a custom Docker
114:36 - container so there is all our familiar
114:38 - logos just to kind of put home as to
114:41 - what you can use it has powerful
114:43 - application Diagnostics you have Cloud
114:46 - monitoring Cloud logging to monitor the
114:47 - health of your performance Cloud
114:49 - debugger and air reporting to diagnose
114:51 - and fix bugs quickly application
114:53 - versioning so easily create a
114:55 - development test staging and production
114:57 - environments traffic splitting so route
114:59 - income incoming requests to different
115:01 - app versions A to B tests and do
115:03 - incremental feature rollouts you have
115:05 - application security so defining access
115:07 - rules with app engine firewall and you
115:10 - can leverage manage SSL TLS
115:12 - certification certificates by default so
115:14 - the idea is that you have all this
115:16 - infrastructure and this is not even the
115:17 - full list but all this stuff around your
115:20 - application uh that you would generally
115:22 - have to do yourself but they do it all
115:24 - for you okay now there are two types of
115:27 - environments that you can launch with
115:28 - app engine you got flexible and standard
115:30 - it's very very very important that you
115:32 - know the difference for the exam because
115:34 - they will have scenarios where you have
115:36 - to pick one or the other okay so you can
115:38 - simultaneously see use both environments
115:41 - for your application so it's not you'd
115:42 - have to use one or the other it just
115:44 - depends on what kind of workloads you're
115:46 - running an app engine is well suited to
115:48 - applications that are designed using
115:50 - microservice architecture so splitting
115:52 - it down the line let's talk about
115:54 - standard and then we'll talk about
115:55 - flexible so standard I would describe as
115:58 - being serverless compute so it starts in
116:01 - seconds it's going to run in a sandbox
116:04 - meaning that there's a like you don't
116:06 - have uh like you're not deploying a
116:09 - container it's just you're uploading
116:10 - your code okay it's designed for Rapid
116:12 - scaling so it can handle uh sudden
116:15 - spikes of traffic it supports specific
116:18 - language versions uh but it's not a
116:21 - custom runtime so if you've ever
116:22 - deployed a serverless function where
116:24 - you're just like choose Ruby that's the
116:26 - language you get of a particular version
116:27 - okay you're not going to get that much
116:29 - flexibility around that it can scale to
116:31 - zero instances so that's another
116:33 - characteristic of serverless compute its
116:36 - pricing is based on hours it cannot you
116:39 - cannot use SSH to debug it which is very
116:41 - common for serverless apps there are no
116:44 - background processes when we're looking
116:45 - at flexible these are fully managed
116:47 - containers so it starts in minutes runs
116:50 - with Docker containers on a compute
116:52 - engine VM so that's what it's doing
116:54 - underneath it's designed for predictable
116:57 - and consistent traffic it supports
116:59 - generally any language version or you
117:02 - can run a custom runtime
117:05 - must have at least one instance running
117:07 - the pricing is based on vcpus memory and
117:10 - disk you can SSH to debug it and you can
117:14 - have background processes so just
117:15 - understand
117:17 - those two and you'll be good for the
117:19 - exam okay
117:20 - [Music]
117:24 - hey this is Andrew bathroom exam Pro and
117:26 - we are taking a look at containers for
117:29 - Google Cloud platforms so containers are
117:32 - a type of compute but there's so much
117:34 - going on here with Google that it
117:36 - deserves its own page so we have Google
117:38 - kubernetes engine so gke which is
117:41 - reliably efficiently and securely
117:43 - deploys and scales containerize
117:44 - applications on kubernetes you have
117:46 - Cloud build so continuously build test
117:49 - and deploy containers using the cloud
117:50 - Google Cloud infrastructure you have
117:53 - artifact registry so store managed and
117:56 - secure container images and language
117:57 - packages you have container registry so
118:00 - store manage and secure your Docker
118:02 - containers images these sound really
118:04 - similar and that's because this version
118:07 - this is actually the second version of
118:09 - container registry so both of them exist
118:11 - but generally it's recommended always to
118:14 - use artifact registry okay you're not
118:16 - going to probably see that like them
118:19 - lined up against each other but just so
118:21 - you know the benefits always towards
118:24 - artifact industry over container
118:25 - registry okay
118:27 - if you want to use a virtual machine
118:30 - like a compute engine you can pretty
118:33 - much just check box it on and now you
118:35 - have a container optimized OS so it's
118:38 - really easy to use containers even with
118:40 - compute engine which is nice you have
118:42 - Cloud run which is a stateless container
118:44 - fully managed environments and you can
118:46 - also use it with anthos so this one and
118:48 - I really should have highlighted this in
118:50 - yellow here but stainless containers is
118:52 - something you want to remember for your
118:53 - exam they also have containers for the
118:57 - AI platform deep learning so this is
118:59 - when you'd be using vertex AI you might
119:01 - need to have a bunch of tooling around
119:04 - that and then there's also the Google
119:06 - marketplace for kubernetes application
119:08 - so you can so if you're using kubernetes
119:10 - and you just need something that's
119:12 - already pre-built and you're willing to
119:13 - pay there's just some free stuff in
119:14 - there you can go there and get them okay
119:17 - foreign
119:20 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
119:22 - and we are looking at kubernetes which
119:24 - is an open source container
119:25 - orchestration system for automating
119:27 - deployment scaling and management of
119:29 - containers it's originally created by
119:31 - Google and now maintained by the cloud
119:32 - native Computing Foundation also known
119:35 - as cncf what's interesting is this
119:38 - Foundation also has their own
119:39 - certifications like the certified
119:41 - kubernetes administrator and the
119:42 - certified kubernetes developers so don't
119:44 - be surprised if you see me making
119:45 - courses for that in the future
119:47 - kubernetes is commonly called K8 the
119:50 - idea here is that the 8 represents the
119:52 - remaining letters so u b e r n e t the
119:56 - advantage of kubernetes over something
119:57 - like Docker and you've probably heard of
119:59 - Docker for containers before but it has
120:01 - the ability to run containers
120:02 - distributed across multiple VMS that's
120:05 - what kubernetes can do that Docker
120:07 - cannot do on its own a unique component
120:10 - of kubernetes are pods a pod is a group
120:12 - of one or more containers with shared
120:14 - storage network resources and other
120:15 - shared settings that is kind of the
120:17 - special kind of infrastructure or
120:20 - architecture that kubernetes has
120:22 - kubernetes is is ideal for micro service
120:25 - architectures where companies have tens
120:27 - to hundreds I really should have
120:29 - highlighted that in red for you tens to
120:31 - hundreds of services they need to manage
120:33 - if you don't have an I didn't say
120:35 - containers I said Services because that
120:37 - could be there's even more containers
120:38 - than uh tens to hundreds you know what I
120:41 - mean there could be thousands but the
120:42 - idea here is that kubernetes does add a
120:45 - lot of management layer to it but the
120:47 - idea here is that uh you know when you
120:49 - have a lot of services it is the best
120:51 - choice okay
120:52 - [Music]
120:56 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
120:58 - and we are looking at databases for the
121:00 - Google Cloud platform and the First on
121:02 - our list is bigquery and this one is a
121:04 - big deal because not only is it a data
121:07 - warehouse It's a serverless data
121:10 - warehouse and the reason why that is
121:11 - important is because traditionally uh
121:14 - data warehouses are extremely expensive
121:16 - but this one because it's serverless
121:19 - that means it can scale to zero and uh
121:23 - it's uh you know only when you're using
121:25 - it do you pay for it okay and so that is
121:27 - a very unique Cloud offering Azure says
121:30 - they have kind of a serverless data
121:32 - warehouse it's totally not true the only
121:34 - one that has it is Google and so it's a
121:36 - big deal okay and it's definitely going
121:38 - to show up more in this course and it
121:39 - will absolutely be on the exam okay so
121:42 - um it can store terabytes or petabytes
121:45 - of data using nosql it is a wide column
121:47 - database service and it also has
121:49 - built-in ml which will visit later on
121:51 - okay then there's Cloud spanner this is
121:54 - a fully managed relational database this
121:56 - is not postgres this is not MySQL it is
121:58 - a proprietary relational database
122:00 - designed by Google for scale it has your
122:03 - SQL so you'd have to do a tiny bit of
122:06 - translation if you already have an
122:07 - existing database but the idea is that
122:09 - if you want something that scales like
122:12 - crazy then this is the service for you
122:13 - if you're using relational databases
122:15 - you've got Cloud bigtable this is a no
122:18 - SQL key value store it is a fully
122:20 - managed nosql database for large
122:22 - analytic analytics and operational
122:24 - workloads so that's there we have Cloud
122:28 - SQL and this is a relational database
122:30 - service so if you're using MySQL
122:31 - postgres SQL Server it's just a managed
122:34 - service to host them there then you have
122:36 - fire storage the nosql document database
122:38 - it adds a nosql document database to
122:41 - mobile and web apps it can get kind of
122:43 - confusing because there's another
122:45 - service called Firebase which we cover
122:47 - in this course and it has Firebase
122:50 - firestore but it's the same underlying
122:52 - service okay this one is very similar to
122:54 - mongodb it's not mongodb it's a
122:57 - proprietary service by Google but one of
123:01 - its key features is that it has a
123:03 - real-time component to store and sync
123:04 - data in real time and that is a very big
123:07 - deal and that particular note there you
123:10 - want to remember because that will show
123:11 - up on the exam if someone's asking for a
123:14 - database and there's a real-time
123:15 - component it's going to be firestore
123:17 - okay you got memory story this is not
123:19 - going to show up an exam but it's an
123:20 - in-memory database to achieve Extreme
123:22 - Performance using a managed in-memory
123:24 - data store service so think of redis
123:26 - that is basically what this is and then
123:29 - last on our list here we have database
123:30 - migration service DMS this is a
123:32 - serverless easily minimal downtime
123:34 - migration to Cloud SQL okay
123:37 - [Music]
123:41 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
123:43 - and we are taking a look at databases so
123:46 - a database is a data store that stores
123:48 - semi-structured and structured data and
123:50 - a database is more complex data store
123:52 - because it requires using formal design
123:53 - and modeling techniques databases can be
123:56 - generally categorized as either a
123:57 - relational database so structured data
123:59 - that strongly represents tabular data
124:01 - such as tables rows and columns that
124:03 - means it could either be row oriented or
124:05 - column oriented or non-relational
124:07 - databases semi-structured data that may
124:10 - or may not distantly resemble tabular
124:13 - data and so the way these things work is
124:15 - you'll generally have a specialized
124:17 - language to query in such as SQL a
124:20 - specialized modeling strategy to
124:21 - optimize retrieval for different use
124:22 - cases more fine-tuned control over the
124:25 - transformation of the data into useful
124:27 - data structures of reports and normally
124:29 - when we just say database we're
124:31 - generally referring to relational row
124:33 - oriented data stores so I think MySQL
124:35 - postgres msql okay
124:37 - [Music]
124:41 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
124:43 - and we're looking at the concept of a
124:44 - data warehouse so a it's basically a
124:47 - relational data store or database
124:49 - designed for analytical workloads which
124:52 - is generally column oriented okay so
124:54 - companies will have terabytes or
124:56 - millions of rows of data and they need a
124:59 - fast way to be able to produce
125:00 - analytical reports data warehouses
125:02 - generally perform aggregation so
125:04 - aggregation is grouping data so like
125:06 - finding a total of average data
125:08 - warehouses are optimized around columns
125:10 - since they need to quickly aggregate
125:12 - column data and so data warehouses are
125:15 - generally designed to be hot hot means
125:18 - that they can return queries very fast
125:19 - even though they have vast amounts of
125:21 - data data warehouses are infrequently
125:23 - accessed meaning that they aren't
125:25 - intended for real-time reporting but
125:27 - maybe once or twice a day or once a week
125:29 - to generate business generate business
125:31 - or user reports a data warehouse needs
125:34 - to consume data from a relational
125:36 - database on a regular basis so that's
125:38 - all we're kind of seeing over here where
125:40 - imagine that this is our data warehouse
125:42 - and we want to generate a report the
125:44 - idea is that we're either ingesting data
125:46 - from SQL or if we're ingesting data from
125:48 - a non-uh tabular like structure we have
125:53 - to use ETL so to transform the data into
125:56 - the format that we want okay
125:58 - [Music]
126:02 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
126:04 - and we are looking at a key value store
126:06 - so key value databases or data stores is
126:09 - a type of non-relational database nosql
126:11 - that uses a simple key Value method to
126:14 - store data and the way I like to
126:16 - describe them is that they're dumb and
126:17 - fast and they generally lack features
126:19 - like relationships indexes aggregation
126:21 - transactions you name it they don't have
126:24 - it but what they do have is speed okay
126:26 - so a key and Value store is a is a
126:29 - unique key alongside a value and the
126:32 - idea here is that a simple key and Value
126:34 - Store will interpret this data
126:36 - resembling something that looks like a
126:38 - dictionary so an associative array or a
126:40 - hash and so when we look at it kind of
126:43 - like a table it can resemble tabular
126:45 - data but it does not have consistent
126:47 - columns per row hence it's called schema
126:50 - list because it doesn't follow a
126:51 - particular scheme due to the simple
126:53 - design they can scale well beyond a
126:55 - relational database and key value stores
126:57 - are generally the ones that are the most
126:59 - scalable but the idea is that because of
127:01 - the simplicity of these things usually
127:04 - you are you know like these are really
127:05 - great for like leaderboards where the
127:08 - data is exactly stored the way you want
127:09 - to see it okay so if you have to do
127:11 - joins or data manipulation then these
127:15 - are not going to be of your ideal but
127:16 - the data is exactly as you needed to see
127:18 - it then they work really well okay
127:20 - [Music]
127:24 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
127:25 - and we are looking at document stores so
127:28 - a document store or document database is
127:29 - a nosql database that stores documents
127:31 - as its primary data structure so a
127:34 - document could be XML but it's more
127:36 - commonly Json or json-like documents are
127:38 - a sub class of key value stores the the
127:42 - main difference is that they can store
127:43 - nested dictionaries nested hashes okay
127:46 - the cut the components of a document
127:48 - store compares to relational databases
127:50 - the easiest way to explain it so where
127:51 - you would have tables they call them
127:53 - collections where you'd have rows that
127:54 - call them documents where you have
127:55 - columns they call them Fields indexes
127:57 - are the same and you do have some
127:59 - ability to do joining via embedding and
128:01 - linking so you know you can leverage
128:03 - that tabular data to kind of think about
128:05 - how document stores are but
128:07 - fundamentally they're not tabular data
128:10 - okay
128:11 - [Music]
128:15 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
128:17 - and we are looking at serverless
128:18 - services for Google Cloud platforms so
128:20 - what is serverless well serverless
128:21 - architecture or fully managed services
128:23 - that automatically scale are highly
128:25 - available durable secure by default
128:27 - abstracts away the underlying
128:28 - infrastructure and are built based on
128:30 - the execution of your business task so
128:32 - the idea here is you pay for the value
128:34 - you don't pay for idle servers and
128:36 - serverless can scale to zero meaning
128:38 - when not in use the services don't
128:40 - generally cost anything so let's look at
128:43 - Cloud functions this is functions as a
128:45 - service when we're talking about
128:46 - serverless on any CSP this is what
128:48 - people look at first is what is the
128:50 - serverless functions okay and so you
128:52 - choose a runtime upload single function
128:54 - code so they're not full web apps just
128:56 - parts of code and they're intended to be
128:59 - short-lived and everything else is taken
129:01 - care of for you you have Cloud run this
129:03 - is for serverless containers so run
129:04 - stateless containers on a fully managed
129:06 - environment or via anthos you have app
129:09 - engine platform as a service so build
129:10 - and deploy apps using traditional web
129:12 - Frameworks and all the underlying
129:14 - infrastructures taken care for you
129:15 - platform as a service is not always
129:18 - serverless but app engine specifically
129:20 - has a serverless offering which is the
129:23 - standard version
129:24 - you have event Arc and this is a
129:26 - serverless event bus so you build event
129:28 - driven solutions by asynchronously
129:29 - delivering events from Google services
129:31 - SAS and your own apps used for
129:33 - application integration
129:35 - AWS is one is called eventbridge so it's
129:39 - the same thing there so the idea is it's
129:41 - application integration for Google
129:43 - services and other third parties okay
129:45 - you have K native this is serverless K8
129:47 - containers deploy managed serverless
129:49 - Cloud native applications for kubernetes
129:51 - you have workflows this is a serverless
129:53 - state machine so orchestrate and
129:55 - automate Google cloud and HTTP based API
129:58 - services with serverless workflows you
130:00 - got bigquery serverless data warehouse
130:02 - understand your data using a fully
130:04 - managed highly scalable data warehouse
130:05 - with built-in ml then you have cloud
130:08 - storage this is serverless storage so
130:10 - it's an object store and the idea is
130:13 - that this stuff is highly available it's
130:16 - distributed across multiple data centers
130:18 - you just upload files you don't think
130:20 - about anything like about the disks or
130:23 - anything else okay
130:24 - [Music]
130:28 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
130:30 - and we're looking at storage for Google
130:31 - Cloud platforms so we've got cloud
130:33 - storage persistent disk and file store
130:36 - uh there is cloud source for Firebase
130:39 - that's not going to show up on your exam
130:40 - but let's dive into these three uh
130:42 - really quickly of both their
130:44 - architecture and why they would be used
130:45 - in certain circumstances so for
130:47 - persistent disk the idea here is that
130:49 - it's using blocks as a means of storage
130:52 - so it has a virtual disk and it stores
130:54 - things just like you would on a regular
130:55 - disk the idea here is that you have
130:58 - direct access to the operating system
131:00 - and it supports only a single right
131:02 - volume all right we'll talk about the
131:04 - use cases at the end of going through
131:06 - these three architectures then we have
131:08 - file store which is a file share so the
131:12 - file is stored with the data and
131:13 - metadata we have multiple connections
131:15 - via the network share supports multiple
131:17 - reads but for rights they're going to
131:20 - get locked when someone's writing okay
131:22 - then you have uh cloud storage which is
131:24 - for object or blob storage so data is
131:27 - stored as objects so so there's metadata
131:29 - a unique ID it scales with limited
131:32 - next to no upper limit in terms of the
131:35 - storage it supports multiple reads and
131:37 - writes so there are no locks in place so
131:40 - what would you use these things for well
131:42 - the first one the idea is that you would
131:43 - if you had a virtual machine and use a
131:46 - volume you could attach a block storage
131:49 - this is just basically a virtual hard
131:50 - drive so you could have a VM with
131:52 - multiple block storage or virtual hard
131:56 - disks but the thing is is that that
131:59 - virtual distance only being used by one
132:02 - operating system at the time the single
132:03 - VM okay so if you needed to have a
132:07 - a virtual hard disk that could be
132:10 - accessed by multiple virtual machines
132:11 - that's where you're going to be using a
132:13 - file share and that's what file store is
132:15 - or you could also just have users
132:17 - connect to it because it's using this
132:19 - NFS and SMB protocol and these are ways
132:22 - where you could easily Mount the drive
132:23 - to your Windows computer or to a virtual
132:26 - machine okay and so then last we have is
132:30 - um uh cloud storage which is an object
132:33 - serverless storage the idea here is that
132:35 - you can just upload files you don't have
132:37 - to choose the size of the drive the type
132:39 - of the drive you don't have to worry
132:41 - about backing up the drive or the
132:43 - redundancy of the drive it just works
132:45 - right and there's no concept of a drive
132:47 - it's just there's a bucket and you put
132:49 - everything in it the only drawback here
132:52 - it's not intended for high iopso input
132:54 - outputs reads and writes like it's
132:56 - pretty darn fast but the idea is that
132:58 - you know if you uh you know it's not
133:00 - going to be used as the primary drive of
133:03 - a virtual machine right it's going to be
133:05 - for accessing files okay so hopefully
133:08 - those three categories are clear
133:10 - [Music]
133:14 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
133:16 - and we are taking a look at cloud
133:18 - storage so cloud storage is a serverless
133:20 - object storage service you do not have
133:22 - to worry about the underlying disks
133:23 - right sizing availability durability the
133:27 - file system underneath you only pay
133:29 - based on the storage so the address
133:30 - storage and the downloads so actually
133:32 - accessing your requesting files files
133:35 - are called objects and folders are
133:37 - called buckets it has unlimited storage
133:39 - with no minimal object size probably
133:42 - there is an upper limit most serverless
133:45 - object storages do have a particular
133:47 - limit but theoretically it's unlimited
133:49 - storage worldwide accessibility and
133:51 - worldwide storage locations low latency
133:53 - so time to First byte typically 10
133:55 - milliseconds has a high durability so it
133:58 - has nine nines of annual durability when
134:00 - I say 99s it's because it's 99 and Then
134:04 - followed by nine nines okay it has Geo
134:07 - redundancy if the data is stored in
134:09 - multi-region or dual region it has a
134:12 - uniform experience with cloud storage
134:13 - features security tool and apis and I
134:17 - want to cover available storage classes
134:19 - because these do show up on the exam
134:20 - this isn't something that other
134:22 - fundamental certifications would go this
134:24 - deep on but Google really wants you to
134:27 - know better in detail of their core
134:29 - services so for available storage
134:33 - classes we have standard and so here
134:35 - this is for frequent values so if you're
134:38 - building a web application or just
134:39 - general use you're going to be going
134:41 - with standard storage now this is the
134:43 - least a cost effective solution it's not
134:46 - expensive but there's ways to save okay
134:48 - you have nearline storage this is one
134:50 - you're going to be accessing on average
134:52 - a file once a month or less right it's
134:55 - going to be cheaper than standard
134:57 - storage
134:58 - but the key thing is once a month or
135:01 - less then you have cold Line storage
135:03 - this has a higher access cost than
135:05 - nearline store but a lower at Rec at
135:08 - rest cost so that's kind of just a bit
135:09 - of a trade-off there you have archive
135:11 - storage this actually has no SLA
135:15 - um availability it's zero availability
135:17 - uh SLA because it's just it's offline
135:21 - right so a very slow retrieval very cost
135:24 - effective rarely or never intended to be
135:26 - accessed you're using these to store
135:28 - like
135:29 - um uh you know like reports or
135:31 - accounting information that you have an
135:33 - obligation to store for seven years
135:34 - that's when you'd be using that notice
135:36 - that there's this number here it says 0
135:39 - 30 90 365. this is the minimum storage
135:43 - duration it's the minimum days a file
135:45 - needs to remain in a storage before
135:47 - deleting if deleted prematurely a charge
135:50 - will occur so the idea is they want you
135:52 - to hold on to them for a particular time
135:54 - uh to effectively use them right because
135:57 - if you delete them sooner than it
135:58 - doesn't make sense for for you or for
136:01 - Google Cloud but yeah I just want to
136:03 - emphasize that available storage classes
136:06 - will be on the exam and they showed up
136:08 - more than once for me so definitely know
136:10 - the difference okay
136:11 - [Music]
136:15 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
136:16 - and we are looking at networking for the
136:18 - Google Cloud platform so the most
136:20 - important service to talk about is
136:22 - virtual private Cloud VPC it is a
136:24 - logically isolated section of the Google
136:26 - Cloud Network where you can launch
136:27 - Google Cloud resources and the idea is
136:31 - you know once you have your slice of the
136:33 - network the amount of resources you can
136:36 - launch is based on how many available IP
136:38 - addresses and that's determined by cider
136:40 - range so cider range or cider notation
136:42 - is a a format that looks kind of like an
136:45 - IP address it has this forward slash
136:48 - thing on the end here and that is what's
136:51 - determining how many available IP
136:52 - addresses are if you have 65 000 that
136:55 - means you can launch pretty much 65 000
136:57 - virtual machines you don't ever just
136:59 - launch something into a VPC you'll
137:02 - launch it into a a subnet of a VPC a
137:04 - subnet is a subdivision of the virtual
137:07 - private cloud
137:08 - and the way that works is that you would
137:11 - actually have to choose a cider range as
137:12 - well that side of range is going to be
137:14 - smaller than the the the VPC one
137:16 - interestingly enough the larger the
137:19 - number is the smaller the IP range is
137:21 - that's just how the math works you don't
137:23 - need it for to need to know for the exam
137:25 - but I like to cover this stuff anyway
137:26 - because it's fundamental information we
137:29 - have public subnets and private subnets
137:31 - public subnets can reach the internet
137:33 - private subnets can't reach the internet
137:35 - now there is no a hard rule about that
137:38 - like there's no constraint that is just
137:40 - like you don't say create a private
137:41 - subnet you just create a subnet and if
137:44 - you don't want uh you if you want to
137:46 - treat it as a private submit just don't
137:47 - give them any external or public IP
137:49 - addresses so here I have a little
137:52 - diagram I made here for you just to kind
137:54 - of explain some of the components this
137:56 - is not an exhaustive one networking has
137:58 - so many features here
138:00 - um it just got too complicated so we
138:02 - just have a very simple example here so
138:04 - here we have our VPC a VPC has to be
138:07 - launched within a region so here it is
138:09 - in US West one we have a public and
138:12 - private subnet these would be launch in
138:15 - particular zones that's how you get
138:18 - multi-zone so you create a subnet across
138:21 - a one subnet per zone so you have three
138:23 - zones and that way you'd be highly
138:24 - available we have uh compute engines
138:27 - these are virtual machines running here
138:28 - so if we wanted a virtual machine in our
138:31 - public subnet to reach the internet it
138:32 - has to have an external IP address it
138:35 - would also communicate through internet
138:37 - gateway in Google Cloud you don't have
138:40 - to create an internet gateway like AWS
138:42 - it's just there there's already a route
138:44 - set for it so that's really nice you
138:46 - don't have to think about that for a
138:48 - private subnet if it has to go out to
138:50 - the internet not internet coming in
138:51 - you'd have to use a network address
138:53 - translation so cloudnat that's pretty
138:56 - standard across all the cloud service
138:57 - providers if you're trying to get
138:59 - traffic into a virtual machine studying
139:02 - a private subnet that is where you'd
139:04 - need some kind of hybrid connection so a
139:06 - cloud VPN or Cloud interconnect you'd
139:09 - probably be using both of these in
139:10 - combination that's usually how it goes
139:12 - or just the cloud VPN but but that
139:15 - basically establishes a private
139:16 - connection to this VPC and it's it's
139:20 - private subnet and that way you could
139:22 - just treat it as the same network the
139:24 - way you're going to protect your your
139:26 - resources is via a firewall rules
139:28 - firewall rules are at the instance level
139:31 - and they're also stateful so you can say
139:34 - allow or deny which is when you again if
139:36 - you're in AWS it's totally different
139:38 - right you have um you have uh different
139:41 - controls for that okay but yeah that's
139:44 - generally the main components there okay
139:46 - foreign
139:50 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
139:52 - and we are looking at more networking
139:54 - services for the Google Cloud platform
139:56 - now these are just basically auxiliary
139:57 - services not all of them you really need
140:00 - to know in detail for the exam but you
140:01 - should know them in general uh because
140:03 - and they can kind of help you out so
140:05 - let's go through them all so we have
140:06 - Cloud armor this helps protect against
140:08 - DDOS and web attacks we're going to
140:11 - cover that later again this one could
140:12 - show up on your exam Cloud load
140:14 - balancing is just a load balancer a high
140:17 - performance load balancer we have Cloud
140:19 - CDN so this is a Content distribution
140:22 - Network it caches your data globally so
140:24 - that you know your websites load fast
140:25 - stuff like that cloud Nats provision
140:28 - applications without public IP addresses
140:30 - allows web apps to communicate in
140:33 - private subnets out to the internet to
140:34 - download things like packages or
140:37 - software updates things like that cloud
140:38 - DNS publish and manage your domain names
140:41 - using uh Google's reliable resistant low
140:43 - latency DNS service traffic director it
140:46 - is a global load balancer this is this
140:49 - has to do with like service mesh enough
140:51 - Cloud interconnect so connect your
140:53 - infrastructure to Google Cloud on on
140:55 - your terms from anywhere Cloud VPN
140:58 - securely extend your on-premise network
141:00 - to Google's Network through ipsec VPN
141:02 - tunnel that's how you get a secure
141:04 - connection from your uh on premise to
141:07 - your your network Google Cloud Network
141:09 - Cloud router dynamically changed routes
141:12 - between your Google Cloud virtual
141:14 - VPC Network and your on-premise networks
141:17 - using BPG so that's just a component you
141:20 - need to do a hybrid connection and then
141:22 - we have some auxiliary services like
141:24 - very auxiliary services for just kind of
141:26 - like monitoring things like that so
141:27 - Network Intelligence Center a single
141:29 - console for comprehensive network
141:31 - monitoring verification optimization
141:32 - Network Telemetry traffic track Network
141:35 - flows for monitoring forensics real-time
141:37 - uh security analysis expense
141:40 - optimization network service tiers
141:42 - optimize your network for performance or
141:44 - cost so for your exam
141:48 - um you know Cloud VPN Cloud interconnect
141:51 - Cloud armor and that's about it okay now
141:55 - they talk about they say like they're
141:57 - supposed to be things like uh sd-wan and
141:59 - and service mesh I never saw those on
142:01 - the exam so these are the real Three
142:04 - that you need to know but these are all
142:05 - the other things that are involved okay
142:07 - [Music]
142:12 - Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we still
142:14 - got one part left with networking these
142:16 - are just kind of like features of VPC
142:18 - that um I just want you to know they're
142:20 - not core to any questions on the exam
142:22 - but they might show up as choices and so
142:24 - it'll help you eliminate them as the
142:25 - wrong answer okay so we have private
142:28 - Google Cloud this allows your instances
142:30 - to reach Google apis and services using
142:32 - an internal IP rather than a public IP
142:35 - address so uh you know sometimes
142:37 - services are publicly accessible uh
142:40 - maybe like firestore or something like
142:41 - that or bigquery as the idea is you want
142:43 - them to stay in the network right
142:45 - because you're paying outbound or egress
142:48 - costs or you're concerned about security
142:50 - and so having private Google Cloud
142:52 - turned on is a good idea that doesn't
142:54 - necessarily mean that your subnets a
142:56 - private subnet because you turn this on
142:57 - it just means that when it communicates
142:59 - with Google services it's going to use a
143:01 - private IP address for shared vpcs this
143:05 - is a way of sharing subnets with their
143:06 - projects so connect resources from
143:08 - multiple projects to a common VPC this
143:11 - sounds like VPC c network peering it's
143:13 - more like a convenience feature where
143:15 - you're not doing it the networking level
143:16 - it's more at the project level so it
143:19 - confuses me a bit but you know I get it
143:21 - there's VPC networking peering so
143:23 - private connect to VPC networks which
143:25 - can reduce latency costs and increase
143:27 - security so VPC peering is common in all
143:31 - cloud service providers uh yeah just
143:33 - joining those vpcs together
143:35 - serverless VPC access allowed Cloud
143:37 - functions Cloud run Services app engine
143:39 - standard environments apps to access
143:41 - resources in a VPC network using those
143:44 - private IP addresses I wonder if you
143:47 - have to have private Google Cloud turned
143:48 - on for that but it sounds like the other
143:50 - way so private Google cloud is like my
143:52 - machine connecting with other Google
143:54 - cloud services and serverless VPC
143:56 - accesses just services that are
143:58 - generally public facing where you access
144:00 - them over public IP address access
144:02 - things via the private Network okay
144:05 - [Music]
144:09 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
144:11 - and we are looking at internal services
144:13 - for the Google Cloud platform so these
144:16 - are services that you generally cannot
144:18 - use and they're and they're designed to
144:21 - be uh supportive of all the underlying
144:23 - infrastructure for many Google cloud
144:24 - services I just want to get you exposed
144:27 - to these because they might show up as
144:29 - twice as as distractors on your exam and
144:32 - you might see them in the documentation
144:34 - with no context and so you just might
144:36 - wonder what these things are so that's
144:38 - why we're going to cover them and the
144:39 - first one actually is an exception where
144:41 - you can use this service but it's
144:43 - spanner and so spanner without the word
144:45 - cloud is the internal service globally
144:47 - consistent scalable relational database
144:49 - and then Google made this available to
144:51 - us as Cloud spanner then you have Borg
144:53 - it's a cluster management manager that
144:56 - runs hundreds of or thousands of jobs
144:58 - from many thousands of different
145:00 - applications across a number of clusters
145:02 - each with up to tens of thousands of
145:04 - machines Borg I think is inspired by
145:07 - Star Trek right the Borg we have chubby
145:09 - a distributed lock manager dlm as a
145:12 - service that temporarily prevents files
145:14 - and records from being used by another
145:16 - user or operation on a virtual machine
145:18 - and then you have Colossus cluster level
145:21 - file system successor to the Google file
145:23 - system GFS provides the underlying
145:25 - infrastructure for the Google Cloud
145:27 - Storage service from firestore to Cloud
145:29 - SQL to to uh to firestore again I
145:32 - suppose and to cloud storage I guess I
145:34 - was trying to write something else there
145:35 - but that's okay but there we go
145:37 - [Music]
145:41 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
145:43 - and we're looking at what is apogee so
145:45 - apogee Corporation was an API management
145:48 - and Predictive Analytics software
145:51 - provider before it's merger into Google
145:53 - Cloud so apogee is a founding member of
145:56 - the open API initiative so that's what
145:59 - we're talking about open API 3.0
146:00 - specification originally known as the
146:03 - Swagger specification so open API
146:06 - specification is an open source standard
146:08 - for writing declarative structure of an
146:11 - application program interface API and
146:13 - can either be written in either Json or
146:15 - yaml format so here it is uh but what
146:18 - what they're talking about here is that
146:20 - there's things called API gateways and
146:22 - API gateways is a hosted version of an
146:27 - API and that and if you're familiar with
146:29 - apis the idea is you can Define
146:30 - endpoints you can say I want a route to
146:33 - users and it's a get and the idea is I
146:36 - want to send it to somewhere I want to
146:38 - send it to this Lambda to this virtual
146:40 - machine or whatever okay okay csps will
146:43 - have fully managed API Services known as
146:45 - API Gateway these API graduates
146:47 - generally support open API standards so
146:49 - you can quickly import or export apis so
146:52 - like on AWS you can use open API 3.0 or
146:55 - Swagger which is 2.0 same thing with gcp
146:58 - same thing with Azure they all have
146:59 - these things okay but in particular
147:01 - Google
147:03 - has apogee okay and so their apogee
147:06 - Services were blended into Google Cloud
147:08 - platform okay
147:09 - [Music]
147:13 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
147:15 - and we are looking at API management so
147:18 - API management is where you have API
147:19 - gateways uh that are basically hosted
147:22 - API endpoints that access Google Cloud
147:24 - resources we got a couple of options
147:26 - here we have the apogee API platform
147:28 - this is an API Gateway develop secure
147:30 - deploy monitor apis everywhere expensive
147:32 - but has many features then you have
147:35 - Cloud endpoints this is also an API
147:37 - Gateway develop deploy manage apis of
147:39 - Google Cloud cheap and simple good
147:41 - Integrations with app engines and other
147:42 - services I don't know if Cloud endpoint
147:45 - came before apogee but I mean I can
147:48 - understand why there's two offerings
147:49 - here you know they acquired a company
147:51 - that had an API Gateway and then they
147:53 - just wanted a cheaper one that's more
147:56 - like serverless kind of offering on the
147:58 - right hand side so but we'll look at
148:00 - what apigee does because it does a ton
148:02 - so we have API analytics we have API
148:04 - monetization where you can actually
148:06 - people pay to access particular
148:08 - resources via the API apogee sends so ad
148:11 - intelligent Behavior detection to
148:13 - protect guys from Attack apogee hybrids
148:16 - a manage API on premise on Google cloud
148:18 - or in a hybrid environment so you can
148:21 - use your apis outside of Google Cloud
148:23 - which is cool Cloud Healthcare API help
148:26 - secure apis that a power actionable
148:28 - Healthcare insights I think that last
148:30 - one is on the apogee side for cloud
148:33 - endpoints now doesn't sound like it does
148:35 - much but it has one really cool thing
148:37 - which is a developer portal so the idea
148:39 - is that once you've created your API you
148:41 - can press a button and it takes about 10
148:43 - minutes what I'll do is it'll spin up a
148:45 - a website or web app that allows you to
148:48 - explore the API and that's really useful
148:51 - if you're just like looking for
148:52 - documentation or you want to interact
148:54 - with the API for the developers on your
148:56 - team and I really like that feature so
148:58 - there you go
148:59 - [Music]
149:03 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
149:05 - and we are looking at data analytics
149:06 - services for the Google Cloud platform
149:09 - so the number one here is bigquery
149:11 - understand your data using fully managed
149:13 - highly scalable data warehouse with
149:15 - built-in machine learning you've got
149:17 - Cloud composer create schedule Monitor
149:19 - and manage workflows using a fully
149:21 - managed orchestration service built on
149:23 - top of Apache airflow you've got data
149:26 - flow develop real-time batch and stream
149:28 - data processing pipelines it is using
149:31 - Apache beam in this case cloud data
149:33 - Fusion so quickly build and manage data
149:36 - pipelines using fully managed code-free
149:38 - data Integrations with a graphical
149:39 - interface you have data prep by trifacta
149:43 - so explore clean and prepare data for
149:45 - analysis dataproc perform batch
149:47 - processing querying streaming using a
149:49 - manage Apache Spock Hadoop service
149:52 - you've got Google data Studio tell great
149:55 - stories to support Better Business
149:56 - decisions Pub sub ingest event streams
149:59 - from anywhere at scale data catalog
150:01 - discover and understand your data using
150:03 - a fully managed scalable data Discovery
150:05 - and metadata managed service Cloud Life
150:08 - Sciences process analyze and annotate
150:10 - genomic and biomedical data at scale
150:13 - using containerized workflows for the
150:15 - exam you want to know the difference
150:16 - between data flow and data proc because
150:19 - these will come up like side by side and
150:22 - choices and they seem very similar
150:23 - because they do
150:25 - the same thing actually these three all
150:27 - do the same thing they're etls they take
150:30 - data and they they do batch
150:31 - Transformations on them or streaming on
150:33 - them but this one here dataproc is when
150:36 - you want to use Hadoop it is it is uh
150:40 - then you have data flow and this one is
150:43 - more of a fully managed service and then
150:45 - cloud data Fusion this is where you
150:47 - actually have a graphical user interface
150:49 - and it's code free all right so you know
150:53 - if you understand the difference between
150:54 - those three services you're going to get
150:56 - yourself some extra points there on the
150:58 - exam other than bigquery nothing else
151:01 - really showed up here just those three
151:02 - okay
151:03 - [Music]
151:07 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
151:09 - we're looking at dataproc versus
151:10 - dataflow versus cloud data Fusion
151:12 - because I said these three are important
151:14 - to know the difference between so
151:16 - dataproc is for open source pipelines
151:18 - that can use Apache spark Apache Hadoop
151:21 - service it's for batch processing
151:23 - querying streaming uh you know when I
151:25 - say ETL or elt this is just batch
151:28 - processing okay and so one of the things
152:08 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
152:10 - and we are going to make sure we know
152:11 - the difference between dataproc dataflow
152:13 - and cloud data Fusion because they're
152:14 - going to show up on the exam and they
152:16 - can get confusing okay so dataproc is
152:19 - for open source pipelines Apache spark
152:22 - Apache Hadoop so it can do uh batch
152:24 - processing querying and streaming and so
152:27 - the real Focus here is really on spark
152:29 - because spark is known to be the fastest
152:32 - tool I think it's like 50 times faster
152:34 - 100 times faster than standard Hadoop
152:37 - jobs and just overall super super fast
152:40 - extremely popular so you know that is
152:44 - the reason why you'd go with dataproc
152:46 - because you're using Apache a spark or
152:48 - Hadoop the downside here is there's more
152:51 - management to be involved here some of
152:54 - it's abstracted away but not all of it
152:56 - then you have data flow this is a fully
152:59 - managed pipeline for batching and
153:01 - streaming okay it's powered by Apache
153:03 - beam which is technically open source
153:05 - but that is not an open source tool for
153:07 - actually doing the batching and stuff
153:10 - it's to manage the pipeline okay so if
153:13 - you need a fully managed service that's
153:15 - what you're going to use then you have
153:17 - cloud data Fusion this is a a way of
153:20 - visually building pipelines it's no code
153:23 - Enterprise solution for building etel
153:25 - pipelines via drag and drop interface I
153:28 - don't think you can use this for
153:28 - streaming it has 150 plus pre-configured
153:31 - connectors and Transformations so you
153:33 - just drag and drop stuff you just run it
153:35 - and as it's consumed that's what it does
153:38 - if you're using Azure this is the same
153:40 - thing thing is similar to Azure data
153:43 - Factory or AWS this is similar as glue
153:46 - okay
153:47 - um you know again I don't think it does
153:48 - streaming but I think that cloud data
153:51 - Fusion probably would have the highest
153:52 - price point for best performance you
153:54 - would be using dataproc for the least
153:56 - amount of headaches but still doing
153:58 - things pragmatically you'd be using data
154:00 - flow okay so those are the three and
154:03 - remember them okay
154:05 - [Music]
154:09 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
154:11 - and we are looking at developer tools
154:12 - now these aren't really going to show up
154:14 - on the exam or if they are we've already
154:16 - covered them the most important ones but
154:18 - I just wanted to go over these just so
154:20 - that you had a full scope just for your
154:22 - own knowledge of things that are here I
154:25 - couldn't even be bothered to even pull
154:26 - out icons for this one but let's get
154:28 - through it here because I think that you
154:29 - know you might be able to take something
154:30 - away from this that you might use in
154:32 - your own development workflow okay so
154:35 - you have artifact registry so this is
154:36 - restoring containers you have the cloud
154:38 - SDK we covered that earlier this is a
154:41 - package to interface with the command
154:45 - line interface or chromatically write
154:46 - code in your code you have container
154:48 - registry this is the older form of
154:51 - storing containers recommended to use
154:53 - artifact registry nowadays you have a
154:55 - code or Cloud code man that's a hard one
154:59 - to say extend your IDE with tools to
155:01 - write debug deploy kubernetes
155:03 - application so it's just
155:05 - um probably I think you install that
155:06 - with Visual Studio code but it's just
155:08 - stuff around burnettis Cloud builds so
155:11 - we looked at this in our in our
155:13 - container section this is for running
155:15 - containers for build environments Cloud
155:18 - Source repositories so manage code and
155:21 - extend your git workflow by connecting
155:23 - Cloud build app engine stuff like that
155:24 - it's just a way of connecting uh git
155:27 - repos to various Services Cloud
155:29 - scheduler scheduled batch jobs big data
155:32 - jobs Cloud infrastructure operations
155:33 - using a fully managed Cron job service
155:36 - if you use database that's cloudwatch
155:38 - right
155:39 - Cloud tasks asynchronously execute
155:42 - dispatch delivered distributed tasks
155:44 - when you're working with Cloud functions
155:46 - you're going to be working with Cloud
155:47 - tasks Cloud code for IntelliJ so debug
155:52 - production Cloud apps inside IntelliJ
155:54 - okay tools for Powershell so you can
155:57 - work with Powershell with Google they
155:59 - got tools for visual studio code Eclipse
156:01 - app engine plugins a maven app engine
156:04 - plug-in so it's all for Java there the
156:07 - Gradle and the maven Firebase test lab
156:09 - so test your mobile apps from a variety
156:12 - of devices and device configurations
156:14 - that one I'm interested in checking out
156:16 - Firebase crash analytics but these are
156:19 - all within Firebase so that's the only
156:21 - issue there
156:22 - so get a clear actionable insights into
156:26 - your app issues techton so create CID
156:29 - style pipelines using kubernetes native
156:31 - building blocks workflows orchestrate
156:34 - and automate Cloud Google Cloud HTTP
156:36 - Based Services that's a serverless state
156:37 - machine event Arc uh build event driven
156:41 - solutions by asynchronously delivering
156:44 - events from Google services that is just
156:46 - a service event bus so a lot of these
156:48 - we've already covered but just just
156:49 - wanted to show you some of these tools
156:51 - because maybe you use one of these Ides
156:53 - and you just want oh okay I'm gonna go
156:54 - check this out I use Eclipse that'd be
156:56 - cool you know
156:57 - [Music]
157:01 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
157:03 - and we're looking at hybrid and
157:04 - multi-cloud services for Google Cloud
157:07 - now it seems like we're reiterating over
157:09 - the same Services again and again in
157:11 - different ways and that is on purpose
157:13 - because I want you to know these
157:14 - services so you can remember them for
157:16 - the exam so let's get to it the first is
157:18 - antho so modernize existing apps build
157:20 - web apps build high in hybrid and
157:23 - multi-cloud environments when enabling
157:24 - consistency between on-premise and Cloud
157:26 - environments remember anthos allows you
157:28 - to extend your control plane to not only
157:31 - other multi or other cloud service
157:34 - providers but also on-premise can do
157:36 - compute and kubernetes you have anthos
157:39 - deployed on VMware so modernize existing
157:41 - apps and build new apps on your VM
157:44 - environments they're never going to ask
157:45 - you to do a VMware deployed on uh or
157:48 - anthos deployed on VMware but VMware can
157:50 - show up on the exam so you should know
157:51 - what that is anthos gke so that's Google
157:55 - kubernetes engine so deploy managing
157:59 - scale containerize applications on
158:01 - kubernetes is powered by Google Cloud
158:03 - this is this is just showing you that
158:05 - anthos handles Google
158:07 - kubernetes environment ethos config
158:09 - management automate policy and security
158:11 - at scale for your hybrid kubernetes
158:13 - deployments you have Cloud run for antho
158:16 - so easily leverage and the benefits of
158:18 - combining kubernetes and serverless
158:20 - apogee API management deploy secure and
158:24 - monitor apis everywhere remember you can
158:26 - use apogee in hybrid or multi
158:29 - multi-cloud okay so that is one of its
158:31 - advantages the Google Cloud Marketplace
158:34 - for anthos easily deploy containerized
158:36 - apps with features of pre-built
158:38 - deployment templates and Consolidated
158:40 - billing migrate for anthos
158:42 - so if you're trying to move
158:45 - servers onto Google Cloud this is going
158:49 - to be specifically for containers I've
158:52 - seen this questions on the exam where
158:54 - you have to choose between my grade for
158:56 - anthos and migrate for compute engine
158:58 - and so if it's a virtual machine you're
159:00 - using compute engine if it's containers
159:03 - you're using migrate for anthos okay
159:05 - there's operation so aggregate metrics
159:08 - logs and events from your infrastructure
159:10 - to get signals at the speed of analysis
159:13 - that's under compute engine you have
159:15 - traffic director this is a global load
159:17 - balancing across clusters and config
159:19 - sophisticated traffic control policies
159:21 - for open service mesh what you really
159:24 - need to know is anthos because anthos is
159:27 - what's going to show up on the exam okay
159:29 - [Music]
159:33 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
159:35 - and we are looking at Internet of Things
159:36 - So internet things are physical objects
159:38 - embedded with sensors software and other
159:40 - technologies that stream data to cloud
159:42 - services or other Edge devices an edge
159:45 - device is a device that is an entry
159:46 - point to a service provider Network so
159:49 - uh Google has exactly one offering for
159:52 - iot's and that's iot core
159:54 - securely connect and manage iot devices
159:56 - using a fully managed service if you're
159:57 - wondering what kind of things would be
159:59 - iots maybe you'd have something like a
160:02 - smart plant Health sensor video security
160:05 - this is a the ring device by Amazon
160:07 - where when people press the button to
160:09 - record you have conversational AI so a
160:12 - home assistant you know like Alexa
160:14 - Google home
160:15 - temperature control with Nest there's
160:18 - these iot kits this is the AWS one but
160:21 - Core 2 is pretty much a standard one for
160:24 - iot gets to start learning how to use
160:26 - iot and of course drones so there you go
160:29 - [Music]
160:33 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
160:35 - and we are looking at Cloud deployment
160:36 - manager so to understand this we need to
160:38 - know what infrastructure as code is so
160:40 - IEC is the process of managing and
160:42 - provisioning cloud services through
160:44 - machine readable definition files so
160:46 - yaml or Json files rather than manual
160:48 - configuration when you want to have
160:51 - governance in your Cloud you want to use
160:53 - IAC because it it means that it will
160:55 - exactly Define what there is uh and that
160:59 - is a really great way to keep track of
161:01 - exact configuration okay so for Googles
161:04 - it's called Cloud deployment manager so
161:08 - that is their IAC service you write them
161:10 - as yaml files and you deploy them via
161:13 - the cloud CLI I was a bit surprised to
161:15 - see that they didn't have like an upload
161:17 - and so I was a bit confused as to how
161:19 - they go do this if you search for IC for
161:22 - Google Cloud you'll see terraform a lot
161:23 - which is a third-party provider for some
161:25 - reason they just kind of like bury their
161:27 - own uh IAC solution but it does exist
161:30 - and I don't believe there's a Json
161:32 - format just the gamble files but there
161:35 - you go
161:35 - [Music]
161:39 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
161:41 - and we are looking at media and gaming
161:43 - services for Google Cloud what's
161:46 - interesting on the actual exam they'll
161:48 - use a gaming company as the business use
161:51 - case so many times but they never give
161:53 - you the choice of an actual gaming
161:55 - specific service which is a bit of a
161:57 - shame to me but they actually have a
161:59 - service called Game servers and delivers
162:02 - seamless multiplayer gaming experience
162:03 - to a global player base what this
162:05 - actually is it's an open source game
162:07 - management server called agnos that runs
162:10 - on kubernetes and I guess the idea here
162:12 - is that you're able to create Realms so
162:15 - if you're ever making a massively
162:17 - multiplayer game the idea is you can set
162:19 - up different regions and the idea is
162:21 - that uh you know like it's just gonna
162:23 - work really easy where players come in
162:24 - and say okay I'm in the U.S region or
162:27 - I'm in Europe and I want to connect
162:28 - there things like that they all have
162:31 - open queue so manage complex media
162:33 - rendering tasks using open source render
162:35 - manager then they have transcoder ai so
162:37 - convert video files and package them for
162:39 - Optimum delivery to web mobile connected
162:42 - TV that'd be for video on demand kind of
162:44 - stuff okay
162:45 - [Music]
162:50 - hey this is Andrew Brown from example
162:51 - and we are looking at the operations
162:53 - Suite which is just a collection of
162:54 - operation or monitoring services for
162:56 - Google Cloud so allows you to monitor
162:59 - log trace and profile your apps and
163:01 - services so the main one here is cloud
163:03 - monitoring provides visibility into the
163:05 - performance availability and overall
163:07 - health of the cloud powered applications
163:09 - you got service level monitoring so
163:11 - Define and measure availability
163:13 - performance at other service levels for
163:15 - cloud-powered applications
163:17 - for cloud logging or reporting you have
163:20 - Cloud logging so store search analyze
163:22 - Monitor and alert on log data and events
163:24 - from Google cloud and AWS error
163:26 - reporting identify and understand
163:27 - application errors then you have APM so
163:30 - you have Cloud Trace fine performance uh
163:33 - bottlenecks and production Cloud
163:35 - debugger investor investigate code
163:37 - behavior and production and Cloud
163:38 - profilers to continuously gather
163:40 - performance information using low impact
163:42 - CPUs and heat profiling Services is this
163:45 - stuff going to show up in the exam
163:46 - probably not you should just know Cloud
163:47 - monitoring here okay
163:49 - [Music]
163:53 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
163:55 - we're going to look at a couple other
163:56 - products that Google has probably not
163:58 - going to show up an exam but you should
163:59 - know about them anyway one thing you can
164:01 - do is you can utilize Google Maps
164:03 - platform within the gcp so if you want
164:05 - to create interactive maps and interact
164:08 - with that API you can do that the other
164:10 - part is Chrome Enterprise so this is a
164:12 - chrome management policy to meet product
164:13 - productivity and security needs we might
164:16 - cover it in the security section it's I
164:18 - think you can use it alongside Beyond
164:20 - Corp uh but which is their zero trust
164:23 - model framework but yeah those are just
164:25 - two kind of loose ends I just wanted to
164:26 - throw in the course okay
164:27 - [Music]
164:31 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
164:33 - and we are looking at Firebase so this
164:35 - is Google's fully managed platform for
164:37 - rapidly developing and deploying web and
164:39 - mobile apps really it's a platform as a
164:41 - service utilizing serverless technology
164:44 - Firebase offers the following services
164:46 - and features so uh Cloud firestore
164:48 - machine learning cloud functions
164:50 - authentication hosting cloud storage
164:52 - real-time database crash of Linux
164:54 - performance monitoring test lab app
164:56 - distribution Google analytics in-app
164:58 - messaging predictions A to B testing
165:00 - Cloud messaging remote config Dynamic
165:03 - links so Firebase is basically an
165:05 - alternative to using Google Cloud
165:06 - directly for users who want to focus on
165:09 - building and deploying their
165:10 - applications in a highly opinion
165:11 - framework if you ever heard of AWS
165:13 - amplify it's based that's the AWS uh
165:15 - competitor for this the only thing that
165:17 - I find like this service is great but I
165:20 - find that it's very hard to migrate off
165:22 - of Firebase onto Google Cloud but the
165:25 - idea is that you know if you just you
165:27 - don't really want to learn all the the
165:28 - infrastructure as the service stuff and
165:30 - you just want all the this convenience
165:32 - around you this thing is really great
165:33 - okay
165:34 - [Music]
165:38 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
165:40 - and we're looking at migration services
165:42 - for Google Cloud the First on our list
165:43 - here is the database migration service
165:45 - and this is when you're migrating open
165:46 - source relational databases into Cloud
165:49 - SQL didn't see this one on the exam
165:51 - which is kind of a surprise because I
165:53 - think that would be kind of an essential
165:54 - one it might show up in the future maybe
165:56 - I just didn't get any questions for that
165:58 - we got bigquery data transfer service
166:00 - this is when you're importing data into
166:02 - bigquery again another one I did not see
166:05 - on the exam then we have migrate for
166:08 - compute engine and migrate for anthos
166:10 - these are two you want to remember when
166:12 - you want to import from your on-prem
166:14 - into or migrate on-prem into your Google
166:18 - Cloud you're going to be using compute
166:20 - engine for VMS and for anthos you're
166:22 - going to be using containers you've got
166:23 - to remember the difference between these
166:25 - two because they will show up in a
166:26 - lineup for sure another one and this
166:29 - time it's for storage not compute but
166:30 - you have cloud storage transfer service
166:32 - so this is when you're migrating just
166:34 - general storage like data it could be
166:37 - from S3 it could be from RAM and then
166:40 - there's also transfer Appliance this is
166:42 - where you are transferring storage but
166:44 - you have so much data like terabytes of
166:46 - data that you need a physical drive to
166:49 - ship the data so these two I'm giving
166:51 - you extra emphasis here these two and
166:53 - these two are going to show up in a
166:56 - lineup on the exam for sure so know the
166:58 - difference between them okay
166:59 - [Music]
167:03 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
167:05 - and we are looking at the types of
167:07 - migration for Google cloud and they
167:08 - Define three and the idea here this is a
167:10 - migration from on-premise to the cloud
167:12 - Okay so we've got a spectrum here the
167:14 - stuff that's easiest is going to be the
167:16 - left the stuff that's going to be the
167:17 - hardest is going to be the right so we
167:19 - have lift and shift improve and move and
167:21 - rip and replace so quick summaries of
167:23 - these three types of migration before we
167:25 - dive a little bit deeper into each of
167:26 - them for lift and shift there's little
167:28 - to no enough modification we're taking
167:30 - the least advantage of the cloud but
167:32 - it's going to be the fastest migration
167:33 - strategy for improve and move we
167:35 - refactor your existing app take
167:37 - advantage of the most of the cloud
167:39 - offerings slow migration process ribbon
167:42 - replace we're rebuilding from scratch
167:43 - we're taking advantage of the maximum
167:45 - value of the cloud offerings but it can
167:47 - take the longest amount of time so those
167:49 - are the three let's just reiterate them
167:51 - on with a little bit more text here to
167:54 - reinforce what they are okay so for lift
167:56 - and shift move workloads from a source
167:58 - environment to a Target environment with
168:00 - with minor or no modifications or
168:02 - refactoring this is going to be ideal
168:04 - when a workload can operate as is in the
168:07 - Target environment little or no business
168:09 - need to change for considerations you
168:11 - this requires the least amount of time
168:13 - because the amount of refactoring is
168:15 - kept to a minimum the team can continue
168:17 - to use the same set of tools and skills
168:19 - they were using before doesn't take full
168:21 - advantage of the cloud platform features
168:23 - such as horizontal scaling fine grain
168:26 - permissions highly managed services for
168:29 - move and improve we modernize the
168:31 - workload while migrating to take
168:33 - advantage of cloud native capabilities
168:35 - so this is ideal when your architecture
168:37 - or infrastructure of an app isn't
168:39 - supported in the Target environment a
168:41 - major update to the workload is
168:42 - necessary some considerations here is it
168:44 - takes longer than a lift and shift
168:46 - migration it must be refactored in order
168:48 - for the app to migrate there's extra
168:50 - time and effort as part of the life
168:52 - cycle of the app and it requires that
168:54 - you learn new skills the last one here
168:56 - is rip and replace so decommission an
168:58 - existing app and completely redesign and
169:00 - rewrite it as a cloud native app this is
169:03 - ideal when the current APP isn't meeting
169:04 - your goals you want to remove Legacy
169:06 - technical debt some considerations here
169:08 - is that it requires the most amount of
169:10 - time to develop and you it requires the
169:14 - most amount of time to learn okay
169:17 - [Music]
169:21 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
169:23 - and we are looking at migration path and
169:25 - the reason I want to go through this
169:26 - stuff is not because they're going to
169:28 - ask questions on the exam but it's going
169:29 - to help you contextualize a lot of the
169:32 - business use case scenarios because you
169:34 - know this isn't like a normal
169:35 - fundamental certification they just make
169:38 - it a lot harder so you need that
169:39 - contextual knowledge okay so there are
169:42 - four phases of your migration there's
169:44 - assess plan deploy and optimize this is
169:47 - going to be text heavy but we'll work
169:48 - our way through it and you'll leave with
169:50 - some knowledge okay so for assess
169:52 - perform a thorough assessment and
169:53 - discovery of your existing environment
169:55 - in order to understand your app and
169:57 - environment inventory identify app
169:59 - dependencies and requirements perform
170:01 - total cost of ownership calculations and
170:03 - established app benchmarks we got plans
170:06 - to create the basic Cloud infrastructure
170:08 - for your workloads to live in and plan
170:10 - how you will move apps this planning
170:12 - includes identity management
170:13 - organization project structure
170:15 - networking sorting your apps and
170:16 - developing our prioritized migration
170:18 - strategy we got deployed so design and
170:20 - Implement execute compute a deployment
170:22 - process to move your workloads to Google
170:24 - Cloud you might also have to refine your
170:26 - Cloud infrastructure to deal with the
170:28 - needs optimize begin to take advantage
170:30 - of cloud native Technologies and
170:32 - capabilities to expand your business
170:33 - potential to things such as performance
170:35 - scalability Disaster Recovery cost
170:38 - training as well as opening the doors to
170:40 - machine learning AI Integrations for
170:42 - your app so we'll spend more time right
170:45 - now into each of these four phases just
170:48 - to kind of cement this knowledge okay
170:50 - phase one is is the assessment phase you
170:53 - gather information about the workloads
170:54 - you want to migrate and their current
170:56 - runtime environment so you're going to
170:58 - take an inventory build a list of your
171:00 - machines Hardware specifications
171:02 - operating systems and licenses you'll
171:05 - have catalog apps so build a catalog
171:07 - Matrix to help you organize apps into
171:09 - categories based on the complexity and
171:10 - risk in moving to Google Cloud I don't
171:13 - think we show it in here but the idea is
171:15 - if you want to see it they have an
171:16 - example in the Google Cloud
171:18 - documentation educate your organization
171:20 - about Google Cloud so train and certify
171:23 - your software Network Engineers on how
171:25 - the cloud works and what Google Cloud
171:27 - products use maybe you could use this
171:29 - course to do that experiment and design
171:31 - proof of Concepts so choose a POC and
171:34 - implement it calculate the toss the
171:37 - total cost of ownership TCO so compare
171:40 - your costs on Google cloud with the
171:42 - costs you have today use the Google
171:43 - Calculator choose which workloads to
171:46 - migrate first so identify apps with
171:48 - features that make them likely to be for
171:50 - movers all right and starting with a
171:54 - less complex app lowers your initial
171:55 - risk because later you can apply your
171:57 - team's new knowledge to Heart harder
172:00 - migration apps phase two so in the plan
172:02 - phase you provision and configure the uh
172:05 - the cloud infrastructure and services
172:07 - that will support your workloads on
172:09 - Google Cloud so establish user and
172:11 - service identities so for Google
172:13 - accounts an account that usually belongs
172:15 - to an individual user that interacts
172:16 - with Google cloud service accounts an
172:18 - account that usually belongs to an app
172:20 - or a service rather a user Google Groups
172:23 - a name collection of Google accounts
172:25 - Google workspace domains a virtual group
172:27 - of all the group accounts that have been
172:30 - created in your organization group
172:31 - workspace accounts it's good to know
172:33 - what all these things are because you
172:35 - know there is overlap in the course for
172:37 - these okay
172:38 - Cloud identity domains these domains are
172:40 - like Google workspaces but they don't
172:42 - have access to Google workspace
172:44 - applications this is one you just need
172:46 - and we cover Cloud identity but this is
172:48 - just when you need
172:50 - um access to Google Cloud but not to
172:53 - um you know the g65 or the the G Suite
172:56 - okay so design your resource
172:58 - organization so organize your resources
173:01 - using uh the Google resource hierarchy
173:04 - organizations are the root of a resource
173:06 - hierarchy and represent a real
173:08 - organization such as a company folders
173:10 - are an additional layer of isolation
173:11 - between projects that can be seen as sub
173:13 - organizations projects are base level
173:15 - organization entities and must be used
173:17 - to access other Google Cloud resources
173:20 - hierarchy architectures we have
173:22 - environment oriented function oriented
173:24 - granular access oriented we cover these
173:26 - in its own section because that's how
173:28 - important it is this one super super
173:30 - important for this course is
173:32 - understanding the stuff you'll see exam
173:34 - questions around
173:35 - resource hierarchies okay to find groups
173:39 - and roles for resource access so set up
173:41 - groups and roles to Grant the necessary
173:42 - access to resources design your network
173:44 - topology and establish connectivity so
173:46 - set up the network topology a
173:49 - connectivity from your existing
173:50 - environment to Google Cloud this could
173:52 - be be a cloud VPN peering so VPC peering
173:55 - Cloud interconnect okay and those three
173:57 - well at least the two Cloud VPN and
173:59 - Cloud energy are going to show up on the
174:01 - exam for phase three this is the deploy
174:03 - phase Implement a deployment process and
174:06 - refine it during the uh the migration so
174:09 - you have fully manual deploys lets you
174:11 - quickly experiment with the platform and
174:13 - tools but it is error prone and often
174:15 - not documented and repeatable
174:17 - configuration management tools
174:18 - abbreviated to CM so configure an
174:21 - environment in an automated repeatable
174:22 - controlled way run remote commands on
174:25 - VMS that check the state and remediate
174:27 - of an instance to the desired
174:29 - configuration State you have config
174:31 - container orchestration so consider
174:33 - using kubernetes so you don't have to
174:35 - worry about the underlying
174:36 - infrastructure in the deployment logic
174:37 - so you could use Google kubernetes
174:39 - engine for that deployment automation so
174:41 - automate the deployment process by
174:43 - implementing continuous integration and
174:45 - continuous delivery pipeline you have
174:47 - infrastructure as code write a script
174:49 - that defines resources to be created or
174:51 - updated in a single deployment action
174:53 - share and stand up entire workflows and
174:56 - environments easily IC tools here is
174:58 - Google deployment manager or hashicorp
175:01 - terraform and terraform is just it's an
175:04 - IAC but it works across all cloud
175:07 - service providers and it's really
175:09 - important to know all these different
175:10 - type of deploy types at the fundamental
175:12 - levels that can really help you on the
175:13 - exam okay
175:15 - phase four of the optimize phase start
175:17 - optimizing your target environment so
175:19 - build and train your team train your
175:21 - development and operations team to take
175:22 - full advantage of new Cloud environments
175:25 - monitor everything monitoring is the key
175:27 - to ensure that everything in your
175:29 - environment is working as expected
175:30 - Prometheus Google Cloud logging Google
175:33 - Cloud monitoring automate everything so
175:35 - manual operations are exposed to a high
175:38 - error risk and are also time consuming
175:40 - automation leads to cost and time saving
175:43 - savings and reduces risk so we're
175:46 - looking at Google Cloud composer which
175:48 - is using Apache airflow spin maker
175:50 - they're not going to ask those on the
175:52 - exam a codify everything so by
175:54 - implementing processes such as
175:56 - infrastructure as code policy as code
175:58 - make environments fully Audible and
176:00 - repeatable use managed Services instead
176:03 - of self-managed ones Cloud SQL automl
176:06 - gke app engine optimized for performance
176:09 - and scalability so horizontal scaling
176:11 - vertical scaling and you want to reduce
176:13 - the cost so take advantage of sustained
176:16 - use discounts Suds committed used
176:18 - contracts which sometimes are committed
176:21 - committed use discounts so cud so don't
176:24 - get too hung up on the word contract
176:26 - there flat rate pricing such as bigquery
176:29 - which I think is the only service that
176:30 - does that kind of flat rate pricing okay
176:32 - so there you go
176:33 - [Music]
176:36 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
176:38 - and we are looking at migrate for
176:40 - compute engine and it enables you to
176:42 - migrate lift and shift of your virtual
176:44 - machines with minor automatic
176:46 - modifications from your Source
176:47 - environment to the Google compute engine
176:50 - the reason we're giving this a little
176:51 - bit more detail is because on the exam I
176:54 - just saw some more questions that are
176:56 - kind of around the feature set of
176:57 - compute engine uh and so I just didn't
176:59 - want you get tripped up on the exam okay
177:01 - so continuously replicates this data
177:03 - from the source to VMS to Google Cloud
177:06 - no downtime on the source via transfer
177:09 - quickly clone and test a migrated VM so
177:12 - after it's migrated you can use test
177:14 - clones and make sure everything's
177:15 - working fine if not you can roll back
177:17 - I'm highlighting this one in particular
177:19 - because I saw it on the exam easily
177:21 - perform all migration tasks with Google
177:23 - Cloud console so just understand there's
177:26 - no downtime with this thing it
177:28 - continuously replicates and you can use
177:29 - test clones all right
177:31 - [Music]
177:35 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
177:37 - and we are looking at anthos for Google
177:39 - cloud and I know I've mentioned anthos
177:41 - so many times but it is in the exam so
177:43 - that's why I want to uh show it to you
177:45 - from different angles so anthos is a
177:47 - modern application management platform
177:49 - used for managing hybrid architectures
177:50 - that span from Google Cloud to other AWS
177:53 - or on-premise data centers running
177:55 - VMware anthos is a single control plane
177:57 - to manage kubernetes compute in hybrid
177:59 - scenarios core components of anthos
178:01 - would be infrastructure containers
178:03 - cluster management it has a managed
178:06 - service mesh this is great for seeing
178:08 - where your resources are and trying to
178:10 - be able to Define slos service level
178:12 - objects to give guarantees to your
178:14 - customers multi-cluster management
178:16 - configuration management migration
178:19 - service management it's serverless
178:21 - secure software supply chain logging
178:23 - monitoring and it has a Marketplace
178:25 - so it is a pretty darn robust system if
178:28 - you're building service based
178:30 - architecture applications anthos is a
178:32 - great enabler for this with
178:34 - microservices but there you go
178:36 - [Music]
178:40 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
178:42 - and we're looking at migrate for anthos
178:44 - and Google kubernetes engine normally
178:46 - they'll just be migrate for anthos but
178:48 - we just extend it with the full name
178:50 - here so you understand what the utility
178:52 - of anthos is which is for migration of
178:54 - containers to gke so when migrate for
178:58 - antos you can migrate your VMS from your
179:00 - supported Source platforms to Google
179:02 - kubernetes engine anthos anthos clusters
179:05 - on VMware anthos clusters on AWS so you
179:09 - can bring them in from a lot of
179:10 - different places you use auto-generated
179:13 - container artifacts including container
179:15 - images Docker files deployment yamls and
179:17 - persistent data volumes to deploy
179:19 - migrator workloads and integrate with
179:21 - services such as antho service mesh
179:22 - anthos configuration management
179:24 - stackdriver Cloud build for maintenance
179:26 - using cicd pipelines microanthus is
179:28 - offered at no charge and no answer
179:30 - subscriptions required when migrating to
179:32 - gke charges for other gcp services may
179:36 - still apply okay so the big takeaway is
179:39 - that you use this for migrating
179:41 - containers to gke and there's no cost to
179:44 - doing that and you don't need a
179:45 - subscription okay
179:46 - [Music]
179:50 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
179:51 - and we are looking at storage transfer
179:53 - service which allows you to quickly
179:54 - import online data into cloud storage
179:56 - set up a repeating schedule for
179:58 - transferring data as well as transfer
180:00 - data within cloud storage from one
180:02 - bucket to another it's going to enable
180:04 - you to move or backup data to a cloud
180:06 - storage bucket either from other cloud
180:07 - storage providers or from your
180:09 - on-premise storage move data from one
180:12 - cloud storage bucket to another so that
180:14 - it is available to different groups of
180:15 - users and applications periodically move
180:17 - data as part of data processing pipeline
180:20 - or analytical workflow you can schedule
180:22 - one-time transfer operations or re
180:24 - recurring transfer operations delete
180:26 - existing objects in the destination
180:28 - bucket if they don't have a
180:29 - corresponding object in the source
180:31 - delete data source objects after
180:33 - transferring them schedule periodic
180:35 - schedule
180:36 - synchronization from a data source to
180:38 - data sync with Advanced filters based on
180:41 - file creation dates file names and the
180:43 - times of day you prefer to import data
180:46 - so what I want you to understand here is
180:48 - that you can use it for cross region
180:50 - application so because you can move it
180:52 - on a schedule from bucket to bucket that
180:54 - you can get data from other cloud
180:57 - storage providers like AWS or you can
181:00 - get it from on premise okay
181:02 - [Music]
181:06 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
181:07 - and we are looking at transfer Appliance
181:09 - and this is a hardware Appliance you can
181:11 - use to securely migrate large volumes of
181:13 - data so migrate hundreds of terabytes up
181:15 - to one petabyte comes in two
181:17 - configurations so 100 terabytes and
181:19 - forty eighty terabytes imagine when they
181:21 - say a petabyte you just have multiple
181:22 - multiples of these drives that you would
181:24 - ship so the one on the left here would
181:27 - be the 480 terabyte the one on the right
181:28 - is the 100 terabyte you can mount
181:30 - transfer Appliance as an NFS volume
181:33 - making it easy to drag and drop files or
181:35 - R sync from your current Nas to the
181:37 - Appliance one you want to use transfer
181:39 - Appliance your data has to be greater
181:41 - than 10 terabytes that's generally when
181:42 - you want to do it or it would take more
181:45 - than a week to upload your data over the
181:46 - network you want to remember these last
181:48 - two they will absolutely help you on the
181:51 - exam
181:52 - for just features in general if they're
181:55 - tamper resistant so they cannot be
181:57 - easily open apply tamper evident tags to
181:59 - the shipping case they're ruggedized
182:01 - that means like they're just they have
182:03 - like an exterior case that makes them so
182:05 - they they're not damaged you know
182:07 - trusted platform module TPM chip is
182:10 - installed on these so they're immutable
182:11 - root file system and software components
182:13 - that haven't been tampered with it has
182:15 - Hardware at a testation so they validate
182:19 - the appliance before you can connect
182:21 - connect it to your device and copy data
182:25 - to it
182:26 - for other features when you're in
182:28 - transit it has a AES 256 encryption
182:31 - customer managed encryption Keys nist
182:34 - 888 compliant data Erasure okay for
182:38 - performance features all SL drives are
182:40 - SSD so there's no moving Parts it's very
182:42 - fast iops multiple network connectivity
182:45 - options here we got 10 gigabytes per
182:47 - second 40 gigabytes per second it's
182:49 - scalability with multiple app appliances
182:51 - so use multiple appliances to increase
182:53 - the transfer speed that's where I
182:55 - imagine you'd get up to a petabyte of
182:57 - data a globally distributed processing
182:59 - so ships quickly to and from the data
183:01 - center to Google Cloud minimal software
183:03 - so use common software already on your
183:05 - Linux or Mac or Windows system okay
183:08 - [Music]
183:12 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
183:14 - and we're looking at Ai and ml services
183:15 - and the most important one here is
183:18 - vertex AI so this is Google Cloud's
183:20 - unified ml platform for building ml
183:23 - Solutions end to end and so a lot of the
183:25 - stuff you're going to be doing uh when
183:27 - it's ml or deep learning is going to be
183:29 - with vertex okay so let's just kind of
183:31 - Define what a ml pipeline looks like so
183:34 - we have data Readiness feature
183:35 - engineering training hyper parameter
183:37 - tuning model serving understanding Edge
183:41 - so that would be like deploying to the
183:43 - edge like on mobile devices model
183:45 - monitoring and Model Management and so
183:49 - we're just going to break it down here
183:50 - into three sections and so before we get
183:53 - into the actual functionality of machine
183:55 - learning Services we need some way to
183:58 - actually run these models so there's
184:00 - Specialized or trained or run or infer
184:02 - but they have specialized virtual
184:05 - machines and containers so that's part
184:07 - of the deep learning environment
184:08 - these will be a compute that already has
184:11 - pre-installed on them uh the like Python
184:15 - and tensorflow and they might be
184:18 - optimized for gpus things like that
184:21 - now that we have our compute we need a
184:23 - an actual environment to build these in
184:25 - and the golden standard across the board
184:27 - for no matter what platform you're on is
184:29 - Jupiter notebooks and every single
184:31 - platform just like gcp they'll just call
184:34 - them like vertex notebooks but really
184:36 - they're Jupiter notebooks okay so now
184:39 - that we have an environment or a
184:41 - developer environment we can work on and
184:42 - we have our compute let's talk about the
184:44 - services throughout this pipeline so
184:46 - starting the left hand side we have data
184:47 - labeling this is a service that the idea
184:51 - is that if you want to train a
184:53 - supervised machine learning model it
184:55 - needs to have labeled data because it's
184:57 - going to use that to learn so the idea
184:59 - is that you can input uh data and then
185:02 - get people to help you label it okay you
185:04 - have data sets that is just a curation
185:06 - of your data that's going to be ingested
185:08 - into the um uh the pipeline or into the
185:12 - ml model or prepared for feature
185:14 - engineering feature store is you
185:16 - extracting out key data and making it uh
185:21 - machine readable for the ml model you
185:23 - have experiments this is when you are
185:25 - trying different iterations of the ml
185:28 - model so you need to remember like
185:31 - parameters and configurations and the
185:34 - history about them you have ai
185:36 - accelerators this is just
185:38 - um I think this is fractional this is
185:41 - fractional GPU this idea is that if you
185:43 - have a a virtual machine and the GPS are
185:46 - too expensive you can just have
185:47 - fractional gpus
185:49 - visor optimization this is a a closed
185:53 - closed Source service that does
185:57 - optimizations on your models I imagine
186:00 - it's for hyper tuning so we have
186:03 - training so that's where you are just
186:05 - training your model so you do like a a
186:08 - container or a virtual machine to do
186:10 - that then there's actually the
186:12 - prediction so that's to doing inference
186:15 - explainable AI so the idea is there's
186:18 - this big there's this big concern about
186:19 - the ethics or responsible ability of AI
186:22 - and so if you can see how it works then
186:25 - you can detect for bias or other unfair
186:28 - unfair things we have hybrid AI so I
186:32 - imagine that is just being able to take
186:34 - a model and deploy it on a phone or low
186:37 - end devices like on the edge closer to
186:39 - the the people for model model we have
186:42 - continuous monitoring you want to watch
186:43 - for things like
186:45 - drift or degradation because if you have
186:48 - a a machine learning model it can like
186:51 - it can get worse at predictions over
186:53 - time and it sounds very unusual but it's
186:55 - something that can happen so you want to
186:57 - watch out for that kind of stuff and for
186:59 - Model Management we can collect a bunch
187:00 - of metadata and I imagine that would be
187:03 - just for like we'd have
187:05 - um a model catalog like a place to store
187:07 - our models for easier deployment and
187:10 - then we want to automate this entire
187:11 - thing so we have pipelines this is
187:13 - called ml Ops it's the automation of the
187:17 - end-to-end pipeline for building
187:19 - training inferring uh you know deploying
187:22 - a model then we have Auto ML and so this
187:26 - is basically automates a bunch of this
187:29 - away it's kind of like your platform is
187:30 - a service for machine learning so this
187:32 - can do it for vision for video for
187:34 - language for translation for for tables
187:37 - the idea is you just upload your data
187:40 - and then it pretty much does the rest
187:42 - for you it will actually run a bunch of
187:45 - experiments and you'll just choose which
187:46 - is the best one so it really makes it
187:48 - easy if you don't know what you're doing
187:49 - okay
187:50 - [Music]
187:54 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
187:56 - and we are looking at tensorflow so
187:58 - tensorflow is a low-level deep learning
188:00 - machine learning framework created by
188:02 - the Google brain team and tensorflow is
188:04 - written in Python C plus plus Cuda and
188:07 - there are apis that allow you to use
188:08 - various other languages and so
188:10 - tensorflow is all based around this idea
188:12 - of a tense or so a tensor is a
188:15 - multi-dimensional array and so they call
188:18 - it ts.tensor in their their stuff and
188:20 - it's similar to a numpy ND array of
188:22 - objects and so TF dot tensors can reside
188:26 - in accelerator memory like a GPU so
188:29 - they're basically a new type of data
188:31 - structure that's just very specialized
188:33 - for machine learning and Google actually
188:36 - has created their own Hardware called a
188:38 - tensor Processing Unit specifically
188:39 - optimized for tensorflow and the tensor
188:42 - data structure the way you write
188:45 - tensorflow is in Python an example of an
188:47 - ml model in tensorflow is here on the
188:49 - left hand side technically this is kiris
188:51 - kiris is a high level abstraction of of
188:54 - tensorflow and so it can get a bit
188:56 - confusing initially the difference in
188:58 - cruise and tensorflow but they're
189:00 - essentially the same thing because Keras
189:01 - is packaged with tensorflow for the
189:05 - Google Cloud platform they specifically
189:06 - offer tensorflow enterprise so they
189:08 - accelerate and scale ML workloads on the
189:11 - cloud with compatibility tested and
189:13 - optimized tensorflow along with
189:15 - Enterprise ready services and support
189:17 - okay
189:17 - [Music]
189:22 - this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and
189:24 - we are talking about vertex AI again and
189:26 - the reason why is I just want you to
189:27 - understand the history of it like how it
189:29 - came about to avoid some confusion in
189:32 - the Google Cloud console so vertex AI is
189:35 - the unification of AI platform and the
189:37 - addition of automl to offer an
189:39 - end-to-end solution for all your custom
189:41 - ML and DL needs so AI platform is
189:45 - technically uh deprecated you can still
189:47 - use it but it's not recommended to uh to
189:50 - use the platform they're always
189:51 - suggesting you to migrate over to vertex
189:55 - AI but the idea here is you would be
189:57 - able to prepare supervised training
189:58 - training with data labeling notebooks to
190:01 - write in document building ml models a
190:03 - model registry to hold all your trained
190:05 - models pipelines for setting up
190:06 - automated CI CD to rapidly deploy new
190:09 - changes also known as ml Ops and the
190:11 - other component to vertex AI is automl
190:14 - so easily trained high quality custom ml
190:16 - models you just upload your data choose
190:18 - what you want to predict and it does the
190:21 - rest okay uh and I actually had a bit of
190:24 - hard time finding the service I was
190:25 - typing like automl uh but really there's
190:28 - a thing uh in there which is called
190:29 - tables and so you could build and deploy
190:31 - machine learning models on structured
190:33 - data so you just like you'd upload the
190:35 - the or actually be a data sets to upload
190:38 - a data set and from there you say Okay I
190:40 - want to analyze this tabular data okay
190:42 - through automl
190:44 - [Music]
190:48 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
190:50 - and we are looking at ML and DL
190:52 - environments so we're talking about the
190:54 - compute and the notebooks okay so to
190:56 - predict train tune predict for machine
190:57 - learning models you need to use compute
190:59 - optimized and specialize for ML ntl
191:02 - tasks so an ml compute solution will be
191:04 - pre-packaged with specific ml Frameworks
191:07 - data science libraries and you'll have
191:09 - to make the choice between a CPU or
191:11 - utilizing gpus CPUs are great for
191:14 - classical machine learning so supervise
191:16 - unsupervised learning things that are
191:18 - math based like uh or statistics based
191:21 - algorithms gpus are really well suited
191:24 - for deep learning they're very powerful
191:25 - but they're also really really expensive
191:27 - so you got to really decide whether you
191:29 - really want to use gpus or not you have
191:31 - deep learning images and you have deep
191:33 - learning containers so here I'm
191:35 - launching up a notebook instance so a
191:37 - notebook instance has to utilize some
191:39 - kind of
191:40 - compute and so I believe this is a VM
191:42 - here that we're launching and it has a
191:45 - tensorflow Enterprise as the
191:47 - pre-packaged ml framework it probably
191:49 - has data science libraries along with it
191:51 - and here it is using gpus so we have
191:54 - Nvidia Tesla T4 and of course there's
191:57 - CPUs alongside gpus but you know just
192:00 - use the gpus on their own there's also
192:02 - Cloud GPU so this adds gpus to your
192:04 - workloads for machine learning
192:05 - scientific Computing and 3D
192:07 - visualization why do you need this well
192:09 - this is fractional gpus because gpus are
192:11 - so expensive sometimes people just need
192:13 - a little bit of gpus and that's where
192:15 - this service kind of fulfills that
192:16 - cost-effective gap for notebooks it's a
192:20 - web-based application for authoring
192:21 - documents that combine Live code
192:23 - narrative text equations visualizations
192:24 - a notebook makes it easy to code all the
192:27 - steps in ml solution while intermixing
192:29 - documentation it makes it easy to rerun
192:31 - segments of code for a fast and
192:32 - iterative developer experience vertex AI
192:35 - notebooks are powered by Jupiter Labs
192:37 - IDE so Jupiter is the industry standard
192:39 - for interactive notebooks for building
192:41 - ml models or for data analysis if you're
192:43 - already in the data sphere you know what
192:45 - this is if you don't you should go out
192:47 - there and learn it very useful so that
192:49 - is the IDE and then this is the Jupiter
192:51 - notebook okay
192:53 - so yeah there you go
192:56 - [Music]
193:00 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
193:02 - and we are looking at the AI Services
193:04 - offering for Google Cloud platform so AI
193:07 - is when machines mimic human behavior or
193:10 - can perform human tasks and AI leverages
193:12 - ML and DL and generally AI refers to
193:14 - fully managed ml SAS offerings I don't
193:17 - know why Google decided to call vertex
193:19 - AI with AI in it because it's really
193:21 - just for ML and and deep learning
193:23 - anytime we just say hi people just think
193:25 - fully managed Services okay but these
193:27 - are the fully managed services that
193:29 - Google offers they're not part of vertex
193:31 - AI so they're just outside of it but
193:34 - let's take a look here so we have Vision
193:36 - AI it derives insights from images text
193:38 - and more and custom or pre-trained
193:40 - models video AI enabled powerful content
193:42 - Discovery engaging video experiences
193:44 - natural language API so derive insights
193:47 - from unstructured text recommendations
193:49 - AI so provide a catalog of Records will
193:52 - make suggest recommendations to users
193:55 - translation so dynamically translate
193:57 - between languages document AI natural
193:59 - language processing to train and
194:01 - simulate human review of documents
194:03 - Talent solution the capability to create
194:05 - update read update delete job postings
194:08 - this one is such an oddball you know I
194:10 - think I looked at it before but I don't
194:11 - fully understand it for the exam
194:14 - uh you know they will they might give
194:17 - you a lineup of vision or video AI okay
194:20 - so if you know what these generally do
194:22 - it's not really that hard to figure out
194:24 - here so we don't have to go very deep on
194:25 - these AI Services okay
194:27 - [Music]
194:32 - this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and
194:33 - we are looking at conversational Ai and
194:36 - this is technology that can participate
194:37 - in conversations with humans so chat
194:40 - Bots voice assistants interactive voice
194:42 - recognition systems of ivrs use cases
194:45 - here would be online customer support
194:47 - accessibility HR processes Healthcare
194:50 - Internet of Things computer software
194:52 - mostly we're seeing it as the first one
194:54 - there online customer support
194:56 - So Google has really good a
195:00 - conversational Ai and they have a few
195:01 - different offerings here so we have
195:03 - agent assist Empower human agents with
195:06 - continuous support during calls by
195:07 - identifying intent and providing real
195:09 - time and step-by-step assistance you've
195:11 - got dialogflow so build engaging voice
195:13 - and text-based conversational interfaces
195:15 - and they have more than one offering
195:17 - here so they have dialogue CX so it
195:19 - provides an advanced agent type suitable
195:21 - for large or very large agents a dialog
195:24 - flow es so provides the standard agent
195:27 - type suitable for small and simple
195:28 - agents just some auxiliary Services here
195:31 - we have text to speech so convert text
195:32 - to Natural sounding speech using ML and
195:35 - speech to text to convert speech to text
195:37 - using power of ml I suppose the last two
195:39 - there should have been in our AI service
195:41 - lineup but we got through it will you
195:43 - see this stuff on the exam probably not
195:44 - but you should know it because it's one
195:46 - of Google's greatest strengths and I'm
195:48 - really surprised that didn't have it in
195:49 - the exam
195:53 - [Music]
195:54 - this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and
195:56 - we are looking at identity and access
195:58 - services and also Security Services for
196:01 - the Google Cloud platform so the top
196:03 - here we have identity and access
196:05 - management so IEM this establishes find
196:07 - great identity and access management for
196:09 - Google Cloud resources we've got Cloud
196:11 - identity so easily manage user
196:13 - identities devices and applications from
196:15 - One console identity platform add Google
196:18 - grade identity access management to your
196:20 - apps Beyond Corp Enterprise a zero trust
196:23 - solution that enables secure access with
196:26 - integrated threat and data protection
196:28 - identity aware proxy that's always
196:30 - usable Beyond Corp so use identity and
196:33 - context to guard access to your
196:35 - applications and VMS manage service for
196:37 - Microsoft active directory active
196:40 - directory so this is just if you need
196:42 - active directory and you want it hosted
196:43 - on Google you can do it that way
196:45 - resource manager this is a hierarchical
196:48 - managed resources on Google Cloud
196:50 - security key enforcement so enforce the
196:52 - use of security keys to help prevent
196:54 - count takeovers tighten security keys to
196:57 - defend against account takeovers from
196:59 - phishing attacks these are security keys
197:01 - made by Google not going to show up an
197:02 - example they look really cool they're
197:04 - supposed to be really good so you check
197:05 - them out before we move on to the next
197:06 - slide I just want to give some Focus
197:07 - here you want to know what IAM is you
197:10 - want to know what cloud identity is you
197:11 - want to know what Beyond Corp identity
197:13 - aware proxy is you definitely want to
197:15 - know what managed service for Microsoft
197:17 - active directory is these are the ones
197:19 - that are going to show up on the exam
197:20 - okay
197:21 - move it on to security so access
197:23 - transparency get visibility over your
197:26 - cloud provider through near real-time
197:28 - logs binary authorization so deploy only
197:31 - trusted containers on kubernetes engines
197:33 - Cloud asset inventory so view Monitor
197:35 - and analyze Google cloud and anthos
197:37 - assets across projects and services
197:39 - Cloud audit logs gain visibility into
197:42 - who did what where when all that stuff
197:44 - on Google cloud cloud data loss
197:47 - prevention sometimes I write protection
197:50 - in there but it's prevention discover
197:51 - and redact sensitive data Cloud HSM
197:54 - protect cryptographic keys with a fully
197:56 - managed Hardware security module service
197:57 - Cloud Key Management Service manage
198:00 - encryption keys on the cloud this one is
198:02 - the multi-tenant this one is the single
198:04 - tenant okay security Command Center so
198:07 - understand your security and data attack
198:09 - service shielded VM so deploy hardened
198:12 - virtual machines on Google Cloud VPC
198:14 - service controls protect sensitive data
198:17 - in Google cloud services using security
198:18 - perimeters incident response management
198:20 - improve your incident and medium time to
198:23 - mitigate I'm just going to erase the ink
198:25 - here for a second the ones you should be
198:27 - focused on for this exam is cloud data
198:30 - loss prevention and security Command
198:33 - Center that's why I give them the icons
198:34 - here so they stand out okay so there you
198:37 - go
198:38 - [Music]
198:42 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
198:43 - and we are looking at user protection
198:45 - services and this is like stuff that
198:47 - would be offered via Android or via the
198:51 - Chrome browser right so
198:53 - um you know not core to Google Cloud but
198:54 - you should know these things anyway so
198:56 - you've got phishing protection so help
198:58 - protect your users from phishing sites
198:59 - recaptcha Enterprise so help protect
199:01 - your websites from fraudulent activity
199:03 - spam and abuse web risk so detect
199:05 - malicious URLs on your website and in
199:07 - client apps but I thought this one was
199:09 - the most interesting is that if you want
199:11 - this I'm not a robot thing you can get
199:13 - that in Google Cloud okay and put it on
199:15 - within your apps okay
199:17 - [Music]
199:21 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
199:23 - and we are looking at secure by Design
199:25 - infrastructure for Google cloud and this
199:27 - isn't exactly going to show up an exam
199:29 - but the idea here is it's going to help
199:31 - you understand to what level Google
199:33 - takes its security seriousness okay so
199:36 - we have operational device security so
199:38 - develop and deploy infrastructure
199:40 - software using rigorous security
199:41 - practices operation teams detect and
199:44 - respond to threats to infrastructure
199:45 - from both inside and external actors 24
199:47 - 7 365 okay internet communication
199:50 - Communications over internet to public
199:52 - cloud service are encrypted in transit
199:54 - network and infrastructure have multiple
199:56 - layers of protection to defend our
199:58 - customers against denials of service
199:59 - attacks for identity identities and
200:02 - users and services are strongly
200:03 - authenticated access to sensitive data
200:05 - is protected by Advanced tools like
200:07 - phishing resistant security Keys storage
200:09 - services so data stored in the
200:11 - infrastructure is automatically
200:12 - encrypted at rest and distributed for
200:13 - availability reliability guards against
200:16 - unauthorized access and service
200:17 - interruptions service deployment any
200:19 - application that runs on our info
200:21 - structures deployed with security in
200:22 - mind we don't assume any trust between
200:25 - services and we we use multiple
200:27 - mechanisms to establish and maintain
200:29 - trust infrastructure was designed to be
200:31 - multi-tenant from the start Hardware
200:33 - infrastructure from the physical
200:35 - premises to the purpose built servers
200:37 - networking equipment and customer
200:39 - security chips to our Custom Security
200:41 - chips to the low-level software stack
200:44 - running on every machine our entire
200:45 - Hardware infrastructure is Google
200:46 - controlled secured and hardened data
200:49 - centers so Google data centers features
200:51 - layered security with custom design
200:53 - electronic access cards alarms vehicle
200:56 - access barriers perimeter fencing metal
200:58 - detectors Biometrics laser beams okay
201:01 - laser beam intrusion detection their
201:04 - monitor 24 7 by high resolution cameras
201:07 - that can detect and track Intruders only
201:09 - approved employees with specific roles
201:11 - may enter continuous availability
201:13 - infrastructure underpins how Google
201:15 - Cloud delivers services that meet our
201:17 - high standards for performance
201:18 - resilience availability correctness
201:21 - security design operation and delivery
201:24 - all play a role in making service
201:26 - continuously available so hopefully that
201:29 - makes you confident in Google's security
201:30 - practices but there you go
201:36 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
201:37 - and we are looking at compliance report
201:39 - manager this provides you with easy
201:41 - on-demand access to critical compliance
201:43 - resources at no additional cost really
201:45 - this is just downloadable PDFs that
201:47 - prove that gcp is compliant with various
201:49 - compliance and security standards so you
201:51 - don't have to log in to access this you
201:53 - just go to the compliance reports
201:55 - manager and it's not even in Google
201:57 - Cloud it's in the marketing websites and
201:59 - you just checkbox what you want and then
202:01 - you can go ahead and download that and
202:02 - read through it and see that they're
202:04 - being compliant okay
202:06 - [Music]
202:10 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
202:12 - and we are going to look at a bunch of
202:13 - different compliance programs that
202:15 - Google is meeting not the most
202:16 - exhaustive list but the most popular and
202:18 - these will be the most popular with
202:20 - other cloud service providers and
202:21 - they're good to know okay so we'll work
202:23 - our way through here the first here we
202:25 - have is the iso and IEX uh or IEC these
202:30 - are commonly used together because one
202:32 - is international standards for software
202:33 - another one is like when you're using
202:35 - physical uh or physical devices like
202:38 - Hardware okay so we have control
202:39 - implementation guidance enhanced focus
202:42 - on cloud security protection of personal
202:43 - data in the cloud uh so we're talking
202:46 - about personally identify information
202:48 - Privacy Information Management System
202:50 - framework so outlines controls and
202:52 - processes to manage data privacy and
202:54 - protect uh pii I know ctOS are always
202:58 - going for the 2701 but the numbers are
203:01 - there to useful to remember so 27001
203:03 - 27017 27018
203:07 - 27701 and I do actually have these
203:09 - memorized because I that's how
203:10 - frequently they come up we have systems
203:13 - and organization control sock and
203:15 - there's three layers of socks sock one
203:17 - sock two sock three so sock one 18
203:19 - standard and standards and report on the
203:22 - effectiveness of internal controls at a
203:24 - service organization relevant to clients
203:26 - internal control over their financial
203:28 - reporting I'm not hearing people going
203:30 - after sock one but they're always going
203:31 - for sock two evaluates internal controls
203:33 - policies procedures that directly relate
203:35 - to security of a system at an
203:37 - organization stock 3 a report based on
203:40 - trust service criterias that can be
203:42 - freely distributed yet here 2701 a bunch
203:45 - and sock 2 a bunch okay
203:48 - PCI DSS so payment card industry data
203:51 - security standard a set of security
203:52 - standards designed to ensure all
203:54 - companies that accept process store and
203:56 - transmit credit card information
203:57 - maintain a secure environment you got
203:59 - fips so federal information processing
204:02 - standard 140 hyphen two so us and
204:04 - Canadian government standard that
204:06 - specifies the security requirements for
204:08 - cryptographic modules to protect
204:09 - sensitive information this one's one
204:11 - you're going to want to remember when
204:13 - you're using a clusters provider that
204:17 - stores cryptographic Keys they're going
204:19 - to be fips 142 and it's either going to
204:22 - be for multi-10 or single tenant I think
204:24 - if you're doing like a cloud HSM which
204:26 - is a single tenant it's going to have
204:28 - fips 140 hyphen 3 okay which is better
204:32 - it's more more strong okay we got the
204:35 - personal health information protection
204:36 - act so pH IPA I'm in Ontario so this
204:39 - one's pretty relevant to me but it's
204:41 - just an example of one that's outside
204:43 - the standard HIPAA one okay we have
204:46 - HIPAA so health insurance portability
204:47 - accountability act this is a U.S federal
204:49 - law that regulates patient protected
204:51 - health information we have CSA so this
204:54 - is an independent third-party assessment
204:56 - of a cloud provider security posture
204:59 - uh we have uh fedramp so Federal risk
205:02 - and authorization Management program we
205:03 - spent more time with this earlier on in
205:05 - the course so U.S government standard
205:07 - size approach to security authorizations
205:08 - for cloud service offering so how the
205:11 - government works with the cloud criminal
205:13 - justice uh Information Services so cjis
205:17 - any U.S state or local agency that wants
205:20 - to access FBI's cjis databases required
205:23 - to adhere to the cjis security policy
205:25 - then we have the general data
205:27 - protections regulation gdpr so a
205:30 - European Privacy Law imposes new rules
205:32 - on government companies governments
205:34 - agencies non-profits other organizations
205:35 - that offer good secure services to
205:37 - people in the European Union or collect
205:40 - and analyze data tied to the EU
205:43 - residents you want to know gdpr you want
205:45 - to know fedramp okay so there you go
205:48 - foreign
205:51 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
205:53 - and we're going to look at privacy and
205:55 - transparency for Google and this is more
205:57 - just to communicate uh the practices
206:00 - they do for these things okay not
206:02 - necessarily going to show up your exam
206:03 - but something you should know at the
206:04 - fundamental level when you're convincing
206:06 - the executives why to use Google Cloud
206:08 - okay so Google Cloud Enterprise privacy
206:10 - commitments describe how we protect the
206:12 - privacy of Google Cloud platform and
206:14 - Google workspace customers so you
206:16 - control your data customer data is your
206:18 - data not Google's we only process your
206:20 - data according to your agreements we
206:22 - never use your data for targeting so we
206:25 - do not process your customer data to
206:26 - create ads profiles or improve Google ad
206:28 - products which it kind of feels a bit
206:31 - um I feel like Google's probably done it
206:33 - in the past but they don't do it anymore
206:34 - at least we are transparent about our
206:36 - data collection and use we're committed
206:38 - to transparency compliance with
206:40 - regulations like gdpr and privacy best
206:42 - practices we never sell customer data or
206:45 - service data we never sell customer the
206:48 - third parties security privacy our
206:50 - primary design tier for all of our
206:52 - products prioritizing the privacy of our
206:54 - customer means protecting the data you
206:56 - trust us with we build the strongest
206:59 - security Technologies into our products
207:01 - Google provides resources on privacy
207:03 - regulations such as LG ped gdpr CCPA the
207:08 - Australian Privacy Act my number act
207:11 - p-i-p-e-d-a and a bunch more for
207:14 - transparency Google has trust principles
207:16 - you own your data not Google Google does
207:19 - not sell customer data third parties
207:20 - Google Cloud does not use customer data
207:24 - for advertising all customer data isn't
207:27 - encrypted by default we guard against
207:29 - Insider access to your data we never
207:32 - give any government entity backdoor
207:34 - access our privacy practices are audited
207:37 - against International standards so there
207:38 - you go
207:39 - [Music]
207:43 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
207:45 - and we are looking at Cloud armor and to
207:47 - understand the service we need to know
207:49 - what a distributed denial of service
207:51 - attack is a DDOS attack so a malicious
207:53 - attempt to disrupt normal traffic by
207:55 - flooding a website with large amounts of
207:57 - fake traffic so you got an attacker one
207:59 - site and a victim on the other side and
208:01 - the internet sits between them so what
208:02 - the attacker does is they use a bunch of
208:04 - remote machines and they issue commands
208:07 - to those machines and tell those
208:08 - machines hey go produce a bunch of
208:10 - spoofed data and send it over the
208:13 - internet and it's going to go towards
208:15 - the victim now the great thing is if
208:17 - when you're using a cloud service
208:18 - provider you're within their Network
208:19 - they generally have built-in DDOS
208:22 - protection now what's unusual with gcp
208:24 - is They Don't Really call that out very
208:27 - clearly but I'm sure that they have some
208:29 - layer of built-in DDOS protection but
208:33 - the service that provides you know more
208:36 - robust DDOS protection is going to be
208:37 - Cloud armor
208:39 - now Cloud armor is a bit different from
208:41 - other cloud service providers in that it
208:43 - does DDOS protection and it's also a web
208:46 - application firewall these are usually
208:48 - separated as two different services and
208:50 - other providers gcp decided to roll it
208:53 - into one
208:54 - some of its feature sets are IP based
208:56 - and geo-based access controls support
208:58 - for hybrid and multi-cloud deployments
209:00 - adaptive protection detect and mitigate
209:03 - attacks against your Cloud load
209:04 - balancing workloads predefined WAFF
209:07 - rules to mitigate oauth's top 10 risks
209:09 - named IPL lists Rich rule language for
209:12 - web application firewalls visibility and
209:14 - monitoring and Cloud armor has two tiers
209:16 - you got the standard so pay as you go
209:18 - and manage Protection Plus starting at
209:20 - three thousand dollars a month pretty
209:22 - standard to see those two tier prices
209:24 - for DDOS protection not that standard to
209:27 - see these two tools rolled into one but
209:29 - that's just how they do it okay
209:30 - [Music]
209:34 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
209:36 - and we are looking at private Cloud
209:38 - which allows you to package Google Cloud
209:40 - resources into service offerings that
209:42 - can be made available and discoverable
209:43 - in a catalog internally to your
209:45 - organization to quickly deploy governed
209:47 - stacks and workloads so this is what the
209:49 - catalog would look like the idea is that
209:51 - you would build different kinds of
209:53 - products within this catalog or
209:55 - workloads whatever you want to call them
209:56 - stacks and the idea here is uh you would
210:00 - apply permissions to say who in your
210:02 - organization is allowed to launch them
210:04 - and so this is a great way to stay
210:06 - compliant because you have these
210:08 - workloads that you uh your uh your
210:10 - developers or your engineers have made
210:12 - sure that are safe to be used within
210:14 - your organization and then it allows
210:15 - your departments to just
210:17 - um procure resources they need uh okay
210:20 - so there you go
210:21 - [Music]
210:26 - this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and
210:27 - we are looking at security Command
210:29 - Center and this is a centralized
210:30 - security and risk management platform
210:32 - for your Google Cloud resources so
210:35 - there's a lot that you can do in here I
210:36 - don't know if you can make it out but
210:38 - you got threat detectors VM patching
210:40 - cryptographic Keys binary authorization
210:42 - security standards you might notice
210:45 - these terms as we're listing through
210:47 - them very very quickly so there's a lot
210:49 - of stuff that lives within this Command
210:51 - Center that you can do three things I
210:53 - want to highlight that could be relevant
210:55 - to your exam is asset Discovery and
210:57 - inventory so inventory and historical
210:59 - information about your Google Cloud
211:00 - resources threat detection so audits
211:03 - your Cloud resources for security
211:04 - vulnerabilities threat prevention fixed
211:07 - security misconfigurations with single
211:08 - click remediation if the exam is asking
211:11 - you which service has a holistic view or
211:13 - everything in one place to do stuff for
211:16 - security this is the service okay
211:18 - [Music]
211:22 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
211:24 - and we're looking at Google cloud data
211:26 - loss prevention so dlps detect and
211:28 - protect sensitive information within
211:30 - gcp's storage repositories so we're
211:33 - looking at personally identifiable
211:34 - information so pii so any data that can
211:37 - be used to identify a specific
211:38 - individual really great example here is
211:40 - of McLovin from a movie from 10 years
211:43 - ago he has a fake ID here but it gets
211:45 - the point we're talking about uh you
211:47 - know driver's licenses government IDs
211:50 - passports email address mailing address
211:52 - birthdays any of that kind of personal
211:54 - identifiable information then there is
211:56 - protected Health informations phis this
211:59 - is very similar except we're talking
212:00 - about the identity health information
212:01 - about a patient some of its features of
212:05 - DLP here it provides tools to classify
212:07 - mass tokenize and transfer sensitive
212:09 - data support for structured and
212:11 - unstructured data create dashboards and
212:13 - audit reports automate tagging
212:14 - remediation policy-based findings
212:16 - connect DLP results into the security
212:18 - Command Center data catalog or export to
212:21 - your own security information and event
212:23 - management system Sim or governance tool
212:26 - schedule inspection jobs directly in the
212:28 - console UI over 120 built-in information
212:30 - types so info types and info types
212:33 - Define what sensitive information can be
212:35 - scanned so there you go
212:37 - [Music]
212:41 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
212:43 - and we are looking at beyondcorp for the
212:45 - Google Cloud so the zero trust model
212:46 - operates on the principle of trust no
212:48 - one verify everything and so the idea
212:51 - here is malicious actors are being able
212:53 - to bypass conventional access controls
212:54 - demonstrating traditional security
212:56 - measures are no longer sufficient so
212:59 - beyondcorp is Google's implementation of
213:01 - the zero trust model and it's going to
213:03 - allow us to do things such as single
213:04 - sign-on Access Control policies access
213:06 - proxies user-based authentication device
213:09 - based authentication authorization and
213:11 - by shifting access controls from the
213:13 - network perimeter to individual users
213:15 - beyondcorp enables secure work from
213:17 - virtually any location without the need
213:19 - of a traditional VPN so the principles
213:21 - here for Beyond Corp are access to
213:23 - Services must not be determined by the
213:25 - network from which you connect access to
213:27 - Services is granted based on contextual
213:29 - factors from the user and their device
213:32 - access to Services must be authenticated
213:34 - authorized and encrypted okay
213:37 - so a zero trust model puts identity as
213:40 - the primary security parameter because
213:42 - remember we shift that over to the users
213:44 - away from traditional firewalls to be
213:46 - protected Beyond Corp is just itself is
213:49 - just a collection of identity access and
213:50 - Security Services to meet the zero trust
213:52 - model requirements okay so that's where
213:55 - it gets confusing because there's Beyond
213:57 - Corp Enterprise which actually is a
213:58 - service and beyondcorp is more of a
214:01 - conceptual idea of these uh identity
214:03 - access and Security Services okay so the
214:05 - idea is that we have apps and data so
214:07 - web apps virtual machines SAS
214:09 - applications infrastructure apis we're
214:12 - trying to restrict control access to
214:14 - these things
214:15 - to mitigate security risks right
214:19 - and so on the left hand side we have
214:22 - um user trust and device trust right
214:25 - then this is where we're going to be
214:26 - looking at their identity and their
214:28 - behavior
214:29 - for devices it's identity and the
214:31 - posture posture being the conditions and
214:33 - in which the environment they're in
214:35 - right
214:36 - so the idea is that they're going to
214:38 - come into the Google Network through a
214:40 - global front front end and this is where
214:43 - we're going to get context location and
214:44 - time so that could be extracting
214:46 - information like the IP the location the
214:49 - region the session age the time the
214:51 - device type things like that we're going
214:52 - to pass that through a rules engine and
214:55 - then from there we have an enforcement
214:56 - point where it makes further decisions
214:58 - before it acts as our apps and data so
215:01 - this is generally the idea of a zero
215:03 - trust model okay and this is kind of the
215:06 - rough outline of where beyondcorp is
215:08 - going to be the idea here is that we now
215:10 - incorporate services so here we're using
215:12 - Cloud identity this is for endpoint
215:14 - verification this is just Google's front
215:16 - end this isn't a service in particular
215:18 - this is just the Google Network okay
215:20 - then you have access contacts manager
215:23 - and then for enforcement points we have
215:25 - Cloud IAP Cloud IAM Cloud identity VPC
215:29 - service controls I've highlighted the
215:31 - three in yellow because to me that's
215:32 - really what beyondcorp is it's adding
215:34 - those three components into it but but
215:36 - basically Beyond Corp is the collection
215:38 - of all these Services working in this
215:40 - model okay
215:41 - [Music]
215:45 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
215:47 - and we're going to be looking at a few
215:49 - Services here that our identity but I
215:51 - put them in the security section to kind
215:52 - of group them close to Beyond Corp uh so
215:55 - the first is access context manager so
215:57 - access content manager allows Google
215:58 - Cloud organizations admins to Define
216:00 - find grade attribute based access
216:02 - controls for projects and resources in
216:05 - Google Cloud so access context manager
216:07 - keeps mobile forces you uh forces that
216:10 - are utilizing bring your own devices
216:12 - secure okay so you create an access
216:15 - policy and to determine what level of
216:17 - access based on attributes such as
216:19 - device type operating system IP address
216:21 - user identity and so the idea here is if
216:25 - it's a little bit hard to see but the
216:27 - idea here is that you're going to name
216:30 - it so I say high axis level and then I
216:32 - can say Okay I want to restrict to this
216:35 - IP range in this region you can even
216:38 - have device policies and additional
216:39 - information you'll get that output and
216:41 - that's the way you'll have to control it
216:43 - now at high or access level doesn't do
216:46 - much on its own we have to mix that in
216:48 - with a VPC service control so that's
216:50 - what we'll look at next
216:50 - [Music]
216:55 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
216:57 - and we are looking at VPC service
216:59 - controls and these allow you to create a
217:01 - service parameter and service parameters
217:03 - function like a firewall for gcp apis so
217:06 - the idea here is you can go here and say
217:08 - okay this parameter is going to be just
217:09 - for these projects and just for these
217:12 - particular services and then you can
217:14 - even apply access levels that's where
217:16 - access levels come into play and you
217:18 - have Ingress policies and and egress
217:20 - policies now I just want to point out
217:22 - that I kept on saying the word access
217:24 - policies
217:25 - and uh Google really makes it think that
217:27 - you create these by yourself but they
217:29 - actually are automatically created for
217:30 - you when you create an access level
217:32 - service parameter or the IAP is turned
217:34 - on they cannot be directly managed by
217:36 - the customer so confusing in the
217:39 - documentation and I was looking for
217:41 - everywhere for this but I guess they're
217:42 - just kind of like there
217:44 - um but that's your Net's not going to
217:46 - find access controls okay
217:47 - [Music]
217:51 - hey it's Andrew Brown from exam Pro and
217:53 - we are looking at Cloud identity aware
217:54 - proxy IAP so IEP lets you establish a
217:59 - central authorization layer for
218:00 - applications accessed by https so you
218:03 - can use an application Level Access
218:05 - Control model instead of relying on a
218:07 - network level firewall so you can Define
218:10 - access policy essentially and apply them
218:12 - to all of your applications and
218:14 - resources using IAP when you want to
218:16 - enforce Access Control policies for
218:18 - applications and resources so the idea
218:21 - here is that you go in there they have
218:22 - for HBS SSH and TCP resources and so um
218:26 - it's only for a particular services for
218:28 - app engine compute engine https load
218:31 - balancer but what you'll do is you'll go
218:32 - on and say I want to enforce IAP for
218:35 - this particular thing and then you can
218:36 - open up this menu and say okay I'm going
218:38 - to add these people with this role for
218:40 - this particular service so there you go
218:44 - [Music]
218:48 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
218:50 - and we are looking at Beyond Corp
218:51 - Enterprise and this is a zero trust
218:53 - model platform uh the idea here is that
218:56 - you can enable it and through the Chrome
218:58 - browser Cloud management you can protect
218:59 - against threats such as malware and
219:01 - phishing for your Chrome users as they
219:03 - download and upload files uh Beyond Corp
219:05 - Enterprise is built into the Chrome
219:07 - browser with no agent required
219:09 - and so you might get some visuals like
219:11 - this saying like Okay who's at risk for
219:13 - which users what domains
219:15 - some summaries of things like that so
219:17 - beyond Corp Enterprise does identity and
219:19 - context aware access controls policies
219:21 - based on user identity device health
219:22 - contextual factors integrated threat
219:24 - data protection prevent data loss stop
219:27 - common threats real-time alerts detailed
219:29 - reporting support your environment Cloud
219:31 - on-premise hybrid access saps apps web
219:34 - apps Cloud resources wherever easy
219:36 - adoption with our agentless approach
219:38 - non-disruptive overlays to your existing
219:40 - architecture no need to install
219:42 - additional agents talking about Chrome
219:44 - right rely on Google Cloud's Global
219:46 - infrastructure scale reliability
219:47 - security of Google's networks 144 Edge
219:51 - locations and over 200 countries and
219:53 - territories so there you go that's
219:54 - beyond Corp Enterprise but don't get
219:56 - mixed up with beyondcorp which is just a
219:58 - collection of services this is a whole
220:00 - different Beast okay
220:01 - [Music]
220:05 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam prep
220:07 - and we are looking at the concept of a
220:10 - directory service so a directory service
220:12 - Maps the names of network resources to
220:14 - the network addresses and our directory
220:16 - service is shared information
220:18 - infrastructure for locating managing
220:21 - administrating and organizing resources
220:23 - such as volumes folders files printers
220:26 - users groups devices telephone numbers
220:29 - and other objects a directory service is
220:31 - a critical component of a networking
220:33 - operating system and a directory server
220:35 - also known as a name server is a server
220:37 - which provides a directory service each
220:40 - resource on the network is considered an
220:42 - object by the directory server
220:44 - information about our particular
220:46 - resource is stored as a collection of
220:48 - attributes associated with that resource
220:50 - or object so very well known directory
220:52 - Services would be a DNS so domain name
220:55 - service this is the directory service
220:57 - for the internet so you don't know it
220:59 - but you're using it right now there's
221:01 - Microsoft active directory this is
221:03 - basically the industry standard for uh
221:06 - most or almost all organizations in the
221:09 - world underneath you have Azure active
221:11 - directory also known as Azure ID this is
221:13 - a managed service on the Azure Cloud
221:15 - there's Apache directory server Oracle
221:18 - has their own there's open uh ldap Cloud
221:22 - identity which is Google's identity as a
221:25 - service provider and then you have jump
221:26 - Cloud which is a one that is kind of an
221:29 - agnostic one where you can connect a
221:30 - bunch of directories to it okay so there
221:32 - you go
221:32 - [Music]
221:37 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
221:39 - and we are looking at Cloud identity and
221:41 - this is identity as a service by Google
221:43 - Cloud that centrally manages users and
221:45 - groups so you get a bunch of stuff in
221:47 - here like user lifecycle management
221:48 - account security single sign-on Cloud
221:50 - directory device management reporting
221:52 - analytics App Management accessible
221:54 - through apis does a bunch of stuff and
221:58 - the idea here is to Confederate things
221:59 - between Google Cloud
222:01 - active directory Azure ID and many more
222:04 - directory Services you can manage access
222:06 - and compliance across all your all users
222:09 - in your domain you can create a cloud
222:11 - identity account for each of your users
222:12 - and groups then you can use identity
222:15 - access management so I am to manage
222:16 - access to Google Cloud resources for
222:18 - cloud identity account if you want to
222:21 - give someone access to your Google Cloud
222:23 - without having a Google workspace
222:25 - account so not having a Gmail and the g
222:27 - Suite this is what this is what you
222:29 - would do is use cloud identity so that
222:31 - it could just get access to just Google
222:32 - Cloud so there are two versions of cloud
222:36 - identity we have free and premium and
222:39 - there is a lot of features here but
222:40 - let's just run through it so you get the
222:42 - idea or the the scope of what cloud
222:44 - identity can do so it can handle device
222:46 - management and the free version we have
222:48 - basic mobile management directory or
222:50 - device inventory basic password passcode
222:53 - enforcement remote account wipe uh
222:57 - Android Apple iOS in the premium you get
223:01 - Advanced Mobile management Advanced
223:03 - passcode enforcement security policies
223:05 - application management Network
223:07 - management Remote device wipe reporting
223:11 - application auditing company-owned
223:13 - devices mobile audit MDM rules so that
223:18 - would be mobile device management rules
223:20 - okay for directories you have in the
223:23 - free basic directory management
223:24 - organizational units and groups and
223:26 - they're unlimited that's pretty standard
223:28 - in all directory Services admin managed
223:30 - groups groups for business Google Cloud
223:33 - directory sync which will give closer
223:36 - attention to later on admin roles and
223:38 - privileges Google admin app for Android
223:41 - Google admin app for iOS just showing
223:43 - you works on both admin SDK API so you
223:47 - can pragmatically work with the
223:48 - directory secure ldap for the premium we
223:52 - have user lifecycle management and
223:54 - there's no user cap on this secure ldap
223:58 - uh I guess it's in both so maybe we
224:00 - don't have to list them both there
224:01 - single sign-on and automated
224:03 - provisioning so for free we have a
224:05 - setups SSO using Google as identity
224:07 - provider to access pre-integrated list
224:10 - of third-party saml apps set up SSO
224:13 - using Google as an ipd to access custom
224:15 - saml apps set up SSO using a third-party
224:18 - ipd with Google as a service provider
224:21 - for premium we have automated user
224:23 - provisioning for security we get user
224:26 - Security Management self-service
224:28 - password recovery which is a great
224:30 - feature Azure ad also has it so I really
224:32 - like this two-step verification so I
224:35 - guess that's multi-factor including
224:36 - security key management
224:38 - we have enforcement control so with
224:40 - security key enforcement and management
224:42 - password management and strength alert
224:44 - for premium first party session
224:46 - management Google security Center for
224:48 - reporting we get admin login saml groups
224:51 - token audit logs security reports saml
224:54 - logs app reports account active activity
224:57 - reports for premium you here we get
224:59 - device audit logs Auto export audit logs
225:02 - to bigquery and you get an SS or SLA of
225:05 - 99.9 of Premium so here you can see it
225:09 - does a lot you don't need to remember
225:10 - all the stuff for the exam but you know
225:12 - if you're going to take anything away
225:14 - from here just understand that Google
225:16 - Cloud directory sync is a subservice of
225:19 - cloud identity okay
225:21 - [Music]
225:25 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
225:27 - and we are looking at active directory
225:29 - now this isn't a Google service per se
225:32 - but the thing is no matter what you're
225:34 - using no matter the cloud service
225:35 - provider you'll want to know active
225:37 - directory inside and out because it's
225:38 - fundamental knowledge and most
225:40 - Enterprises are using it and now with
225:42 - everyone going towards a zero trust
225:43 - model uh you know identity and active
225:46 - directory just go hand in hand okay so
225:48 - we're going to put some extra attention
225:49 - here on this one so Microsoft introduced
225:52 - active directory domain services in
225:54 - Windows 2000 to give organizations the
225:56 - ability to manage multiple on-premise
225:58 - infrastructure components and systems
226:00 - using a single identity per user so
226:03 - here's the big architectural diagram
226:05 - that I created so the idea is that you
226:07 - have your your Enterprise which is the
226:09 - forest here and these are made up of
226:11 - domains a domain is a is a means to host
226:14 - these different uh directory services
226:16 - and it's also the means to which people
226:19 - authorize or authenticate to your
226:23 - directory okay so the idea is that you
226:25 - can think of remains as actual servers
226:27 - and you're going to have to have to have
226:29 - redundant ones because if the main one
226:30 - goes down you'll want to make sure
226:32 - people can still log in and do their
226:34 - business and you might want domains that
226:36 - are closer to the region to which they
226:39 - are authenticating so things are very
226:41 - very fast that's why we're seeing a lot
226:43 - more here than just a single one okay
226:47 - when we look inside of a domain doesn't
226:49 - matter if it's a child or domain we have
226:51 - organizational units these are just ways
226:54 - of structuring maybe departments or
226:55 - things like that and with organizational
226:57 - units we have objects and so objects
226:59 - could be groups users printers servers
227:04 - devices we saw a larger list when we
227:07 - listed out directory service so we don't
227:09 - need to go through it but the idea is
227:10 - that it's just basically things within
227:12 - your network okay then we have active
227:15 - directory domain Services uh shortened
227:17 - to adds so these are the services or
227:21 - that consist of multiple directory
227:22 - Services all right I know it gets
227:24 - confusing because there's directory
227:25 - service and then there's directory
227:27 - services but these are services within a
227:29 - directory service if that makes any
227:31 - sense so domain Services these are the
227:33 - foundational foundation stone of every
227:35 - Windows domain Network stores
227:37 - information about members of The Domain
227:38 - including devices users verifies the
227:40 - credentials and defines the access
227:42 - rights the server running this service
227:45 - is called a domain can controller all
227:48 - right so usually when we talk about the
227:49 - actual server that people are calling
227:51 - them domain controllers all right
227:53 - so some of the services that can be
227:56 - found within active directory would be
227:58 - active directory L lightweight directory
228:02 - service so this is an implementation of
228:04 - ldap protocol for Azure directory domain
228:07 - services and we're going to definitely
228:08 - talk about ldap in this course we have
228:10 - active directory certificates services
228:12 - so it establishes an on-premise public
228:15 - key infrastructure create validate
228:17 - revoke public key certificates for
228:19 - internal uses all right we have active
228:21 - directory Federation services so a
228:23 - single sign-on we talk about single
228:25 - sign-on in this course too so users may
228:27 - use several web-based Services network
228:29 - resources using only one set of
228:32 - credentials stored at a central location
228:34 - we have active directory Rights
228:36 - Management Service this is a server
228:37 - server software for information Rights
228:39 - Management shipped with Windows Server
228:41 - uses encryption and a form of selective
228:43 - functionality denial for limiting access
228:45 - to documents there's a bunch of
228:47 - terminology for active directory I want
228:49 - to get you used to it so let's go
228:51 - through it domain is an area of a
228:54 - network organized by a single
228:55 - authentication database and an active
228:57 - director domain is a logical grouping of
228:59 - 80 objects of a network a domain
229:01 - controller is a server that
229:03 - authenticates user identities and
229:05 - authorizes their access to resources so
229:08 - this is The Logical grouping this is the
229:11 - actual server that does the work a
229:13 - domain computer is a is a computer that
229:16 - is registered with a central
229:17 - authentication database a domain
229:19 - computer would be an 80 object an 80
229:21 - object is the basic element of an active
229:23 - directory of active directory such as
229:25 - users groups printers computers shared
229:27 - folders
229:28 - gpos Group Policy objects is a virtual
229:31 - collection of policy settings it
229:33 - controls what 80 objects you have access
229:35 - to organizational units is a subdivision
229:37 - within an active directory into which
229:40 - you can place users groups computers and
229:42 - other organizational units very common
229:43 - to make your departments out of OU's
229:46 - directory service such as active
229:49 - directory domain service provides the
229:50 - methods of storing directory data and
229:52 - making the data available to the network
229:54 - users and administrators a directory
229:56 - service runs on a domain controller so
229:59 - you know hopefully you have some kind of
230:01 - idea what active directory is but yeah
230:03 - that's the quick crash course okay
230:05 - [Music]
230:09 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
230:11 - and we are looking at managed service
230:13 - for Microsoft active directory and this
230:15 - is just active directory hosted on the
230:17 - Google Cloud platform why would you want
230:18 - to do this when you have Cloud identity
230:20 - well there's just a lot of Rich features
230:23 - within active directory that a cloud
230:25 - identity doesn't have or maybe your team
230:27 - is used to using active directory you
230:29 - can use cloud identity and active
230:31 - director together because you can just
230:32 - Federate your active directory over to
230:34 - Club identity but traditionally active
230:37 - directory has always been hosted on
230:38 - premise however a lot of people are
230:40 - shifting to the cloud because you just
230:41 - don't have to deal with those servers
230:43 - anymore so there is a use case for this
230:45 - I think a lot of people if they're going
230:47 - to be using a managed active directory
230:48 - they're going to use Azure ad just
230:50 - because Azure or Microsoft is the best
230:53 - at it but other clusters providers such
230:55 - as AWS and gcp will give you a managed
230:59 - version of active directory so
231:00 - compatibility with 80 dependent apps so
231:03 - runs real Microsoft ad controllers uses
231:05 - standard active directory features so
231:07 - gpos remote server Administration tools
231:10 - virtually maintenance free so high
231:12 - availability High availability
231:13 - automatically patched configured with
231:15 - secure defaults protected by appropriate
231:17 - Network firewall rules seamless
231:19 - multi-region deployment so simply expand
231:22 - the service to additional regions while
231:23 - continuing to use the same managed 80
231:25 - domain hybrid identity support So
231:28 - support your on-premise ad domain to
231:30 - Google Cloud deploy a standalone domain
231:33 - for your cloud-based workloads so there
231:35 - you go
231:36 - [Music]
231:40 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
231:42 - and we are looking at the concept of
231:44 - identity providers also known as ipds
231:46 - and so a system entity that creates
231:48 - maintains and manages identity
231:49 - information for principles and also
231:51 - provides authentication services to
231:53 - Applications with a federation or
231:55 - distributed Network a trusted provider
231:57 - for your user identity that lets you use
231:59 - authenticate to access other services
232:01 - identity providers could be things like
232:03 - Facebook Amazon Google Twitter GitHub
232:05 - and Linkedin so Federate identity is a
232:08 - method of linking a user's identity
232:10 - across multiple separate identity
232:11 - management systems and the way you're
232:13 - going to do this is via openid so open
232:15 - standard and decentralized
232:17 - Authentication Protocol so this is your
232:19 - ability to be able to log into a
232:21 - different social media platform using
232:22 - Google or Facebook account openid is all
232:25 - about providing who you are you have
232:27 - oauth 2.0 this is the Indus industry
232:30 - standard protocol for authorization of
232:32 - oauth doesn't share password data but
232:34 - instead uses authorization tokens to
232:36 - prove an identity between consumers and
232:38 - service providers oauth is about
232:40 - granting access functionality and I put
232:43 - these in the lineup because you know
232:44 - what I even get these two mixed up but
232:46 - they go hand in hand alright so
232:47 - providing who you are about granting
232:49 - access to functionality
232:51 - then you have saml so security assertion
232:53 - and markup language is an open source or
232:55 - open standard for exchanging
232:58 - authentication and authorization between
232:59 - an identity provider and a service
233:01 - provider an important use case for saml
233:03 - is single sign-on via the web browser
233:05 - and that's the reason we're bringing up
233:07 - saml is so that we can talk about single
233:09 - sign-on
233:10 - [Music]
233:14 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
233:16 - and we are taking a look here at single
233:18 - sign-on also known as SSO and this is an
233:20 - authentication scheme that allows a user
233:22 - to log in with a single ID and password
233:24 - to different systems and software so SSO
233:27 - allows it departments to administer a
233:29 - single identity that can access many
233:31 - machines and cloud services so here on
233:33 - the right hand side is the many things
233:35 - that we want to access and on the left
233:37 - hand side we have our directory service
233:39 - in this case it's Azure active directory
233:40 - and we have a user that wants to connect
233:42 - with a single username and password to
233:45 - all the stuff so through the saml
233:46 - protocol which we covered in the last
233:48 - slide we can do single sign-on to all of
233:51 - these services and the key thing to
233:54 - remember is that SSO is seamless so once
233:56 - the user logs into their primary
233:58 - directory they don't have to keep on
234:00 - entering their passwords in it's just
234:01 - going to seem like they they're already
234:03 - logged in when they visit these
234:04 - resources okay
234:05 - [Music]
234:10 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
234:11 - and we're taking a look here at
234:13 - lightweight directory access protocol
234:14 - ldap is an open vendor neutral industry
234:17 - standard for application protocols for
234:19 - accessing and maintaining distributed
234:21 - directory information Services over IP
234:23 - and networks so a common use of ldap is
234:26 - to provide a central place to store
234:27 - users and usernames and passwords ldap
234:31 - enables for same sign-on so same sign-on
234:34 - allows users to use a single ID and
234:36 - password but they'll have to enter it
234:38 - every single time they want to log in
234:39 - this idea is you might have an active
234:42 - directory server on premise and it's
234:45 - going to synchronize with an ldap
234:46 - directory so you can get access to
234:49 - things to like Google Cloud kubernetes
234:51 - Jenkins and you're noticing that I'm not
234:53 - listening out generic web apps these are
234:55 - more kind of like heavy duty workloads
234:57 - because that's where ldap kind of uh is
235:00 - used a lot okay
235:02 - so why use ldap when SSO is more
235:05 - convenient because SSO you don't have to
235:07 - enter your password and username every
235:09 - single time well the thing is SSO
235:10 - systems are often built on top of ldap
235:14 - but ldap was not designed evenly to work
235:16 - with web applications so you don't do
235:19 - single sign-on with ldap and a lot of
235:21 - times you just don't see direct
235:22 - integration with them so you'll see ldap
235:24 - more on on premise or using devops
235:26 - workloads like kubernetes or Jenkins so
235:28 - some systems only support integration
235:30 - with ldap and not SSO so it's just times
235:33 - when you have to use it okay
235:34 - [Music]
235:38 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
235:40 - and we are looking at Google Cloud
235:42 - directory sync so enables administrators
235:44 - to synchronize users groups and other
235:45 - data from an active directory ldap
235:47 - service to their managed service for ad
235:50 - for Microsoft active directory within
235:52 - Google so it's just a synchronization
235:54 - service
235:55 - um and so this one will show up on the
235:57 - exam for sure so make sure you know what
235:59 - it is so you can choose it correctly
236:01 - okay
236:01 - [Music]
236:06 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
236:07 - and we are taking a look here at service
236:09 - level agreements also known as SLA so an
236:12 - SLA is a formal commitment about the
236:13 - expected level of service between a
236:15 - customer and a provider so when a
236:17 - service level is not met and if customer
236:19 - meets its obligation under SLA customers
236:21 - will be eligible to receive compensation
236:24 - so Financial or service credits you can
236:26 - think of them as store credits because
236:28 - you can use them towards uh the most uh
236:31 - the services provided by the CSP whether
236:34 - it's compute storage databases Etc but
236:36 - there will be sometimes exceptions so
236:38 - maybe like registering domains because
236:40 - that actually costs money okay
236:43 - so then you have service level
236:44 - indicators so slis this is a metric or
236:47 - measurement that indicates what measure
236:49 - of performance a customer is receiving
236:51 - at a given time a SLI metric could be
236:54 - uptime performance availability
236:55 - throughput latency error rate durability
236:58 - and correctness then you have slos so
237:01 - service level objects that is the
237:03 - objective that the provider has agreed
237:04 - to meet so slos are represented as a
237:07 - specific Target percentage over a period
237:09 - time so an example here could be
237:11 - availability SLA of 99.99 in a period of
237:16 - three months Target percentages uh that
237:18 - you commonly see are 99.95
237:21 - 99.99
237:26 - 99.9999999999999 and so that is not nine
237:31 - nines after the decimal point so we'll
237:33 - say nine nines of availability nine
237:35 - nines of durability then you have one
237:37 - that's for 11. so you'd say like nine
237:39 - elevens of durability and so the idea
237:42 - here is that the SLA contains slos right
237:47 - and these are at the service level and
237:48 - then the slos are based off of the slis
237:51 - okay
237:52 - [Music]
237:56 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
237:58 - and we're going to go through the slas
238:00 - for Google Cloud platform now it's in
238:01 - the exam guide but it doesn't really
238:03 - show up on the exam so uh I don't think
238:05 - you have to pay close attention here and
238:06 - this is really boring because we're just
238:08 - going to list out a bunch of numbers but
238:10 - you know maybe you'll remember some that
238:12 - are 95 and some that are 99 and that
238:14 - might help you on the exam so let's get
238:16 - to it so for compute engine uh and
238:18 - mostly I think all of these are going to
238:20 - be in the monthly and generally for
238:22 - uptime but for covered Services
238:24 - instances in multiple zones 99.99 single
238:28 - instance 99.5 percent load balancing
238:30 - 99.99
238:32 - then what we have here is uh Cloud SQL
238:36 - and Cloud functions it's a monthly
238:38 - uptime of 99.95 for bigquery and app
238:41 - engines it's uh monthly uptime for 99.99
238:44 - for cloud storage it's going to vary
238:46 - based on the type of storage but
238:48 - standard storage in multi-region dual
238:51 - region is going to be 99.95 standard
238:54 - storage in Regional location for cloud
238:56 - cloud storage near line cold line
238:58 - multi-region dual region is going to be
239:00 - 99.9 percent near a line or cold Line
239:03 - storage class and region location
239:05 - cloud storage is going to be 99.0
239:08 - percent that's because of the the
239:10 - durability is reduced you're paying for
239:13 - uh like I mean like it's cold line
239:14 - you're not going to access it very often
239:16 - so it's less of a problem but that makes
239:18 - sense why it's lower for cloudnet this
239:20 - one is just the outlier where it's 99.9
239:22 - percent
239:24 - uh and then AI platform training
239:26 - prediction is 99.95 it's like the one up
239:28 - here I should have grouped it up here
239:30 - but I didn't
239:31 - uh so for big cloud bigtable we have a
239:34 - bunch of different values so if it's
239:36 - multi-cluster routing so 99. triple
239:38 - nines if it's less than uh or fewer than
239:40 - three regions it's just two nines single
239:43 - cluster routing policies 0.9 zonal
239:46 - instance 0.9
239:48 - for apogee uh and it's very unlikely
239:51 - they'll ever ask you slas for apogee on
239:53 - the exam but we have them here anyway so
239:55 - for standard 99 for Enterprise 99.9 for
239:58 - Enterprise Plus 99.9 percent for cloud
240:01 - spanner uh you have uh three nines of
240:04 - durability for multi-region and then we
240:06 - have two nines for regional instance so
240:08 - there you go
240:09 - [Music]
240:13 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
240:15 - and we are looking at gcp support plans
240:17 - so we got basic standard enhanced
240:20 - premium and then uh just for cost this
240:23 - one's free this one's 29 bucks this
240:24 - one's 500 and this one uh you have to
240:27 - contact sales so this is premium is your
240:29 - Enterprise support enhanced is your
240:31 - business support when you're looking at
240:33 - AWS or Azure they'll charge a hundred
240:35 - dollars but for some reason gcp charges
240:38 - five hundred dollars I think that is not
240:40 - smart on their part because it really
240:42 - makes it hard for adoption when you are
240:44 - a small to medium company no idea why
240:47 - they did that but that's just what it is
240:48 - okay so uh you get unlimited access to
240:51 - support for standard enhanced and
240:52 - premium they just mean like I guess to
240:54 - access the platform I I would think that
240:56 - it's unlimited across the board but
240:58 - that's just how they display it there
241:00 - for billing support that's asking
241:01 - billing queries you can use email phone
241:04 - or chat in terms of response time uh
241:07 - standard is uh priority two so the the
241:10 - larger the number the lower the priority
241:13 - okay priorities 0 is is the highest
241:15 - right so you can expect a four hour
241:18 - response here and enhance support you're
241:20 - looking at one hour response and for
241:22 - premium you're looking at 15 minute
241:23 - response times uh but I mean this varies
241:26 - based on this is when you actually have
241:28 - a severe issue so it's not for general
241:31 - questions okay for technical support you
241:34 - can only do email with standard and this
241:37 - is pretty common like with either Azure
241:39 - or AWS they'll call it the standard will
241:41 - be just called developer support so yeah
241:43 - it's just emails and you're looking at
241:45 - pretty much a 24-hour response time for
241:47 - that and for technical support for
241:50 - enhanced and premium you got case emails
241:52 - and phone so that is a um I don't know
241:56 - if they have chat because I I didn't
241:57 - really want to pay for 500 to find out
242:00 - if they had chat but I've definitely
242:02 - experienced chat via billing support and
242:03 - it's pretty darn good but if you want to
242:05 - get on the phone for someone you got to
242:06 - be paying a lot more
242:08 - uh for eight out of five uh response for
242:11 - high impact issues uh so 8 out of five
242:14 - means um eight hours out of the day so
242:16 - your standard at five days a week so
242:18 - that's your standard work week 24 7. so
242:20 - anytime you want to ask a question uh
242:22 - they're gonna be able to help you out
242:24 - okay you only get English support and
242:26 - standard if you need Japanese Mandarin
242:28 - Chinese or Korean uh that's an enhanced
242:31 - support and premium support and so some
242:33 - of the features that are found in both
242:34 - enhance and premium is a active assist
242:38 - recommender API third-party support
242:40 - Cloud support API technical support
242:43 - escalation for enhanced support you get
242:46 - access or you can purchase additionally
242:47 - technical account advisor advisory
242:50 - service taas in premium support you get
242:54 - a tam so a technical account manager and
242:56 - so that is a person that is assigned to
242:57 - you you get event Management Service
242:59 - Opera operational Health reviews
243:01 - customer aware support new product
243:03 - previews training credits and access to
243:06 - purchase Mission critical services so so
243:09 - you can see there's a lot of stuff here
243:10 - in terms of the exam I didn't see a
243:12 - single question about like what support
243:15 - plan does what which I was shocked
243:16 - because when you do AWS and Azure you
243:18 - see that kind of stuff there
243:21 - um it's definitely on the exam guide so
243:22 - I don't know why I didn't see any
243:23 - questions and people all the other
243:25 - people I asked never saw those questions
243:26 - either maybe they'll add them in the
243:28 - future so it's worth knowing this page I
243:30 - think in terms of all these feature sets
243:32 - they're definitely not going to ask you
243:34 - them on the exam but we're going to
243:35 - cover them anyway all this stuff here
243:37 - because I think that if you are learning
243:40 - fundamental knowledge and you want to
243:42 - convince your stakeholders you know why
243:44 - to use gcp you want to know the full
243:45 - offering of support okay
243:47 - [Music]
243:52 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
243:53 - and we are looking at active assist
243:55 - recommender so active assist is a
243:57 - portfolio of intelligent tools and
243:58 - capabilities to actively assist you in
244:01 - managing uh complexity in your Cloud
244:03 - operations uh so make improvements
244:06 - easily prevent mistakes from happening
244:07 - find out what went wrong quickly and so
244:10 - here on the right hand side is a
244:12 - recommendation where it's saying this is
244:14 - my current configuration but it's
244:16 - recommending that I reduce this instance
244:18 - to six feet pcus and 20 Gigabytes so I
244:21 - can save a bunch of money so three
244:23 - activities is making proactive
244:25 - improvements to your cloud with smart
244:26 - recommendations preventing mistakes from
244:28 - happening in the first place by giving
244:30 - better analysis helping you figure out
244:32 - why something went wrong by using
244:34 - intuitive troubleshooting tools if you
244:36 - use something like trusted advisor in
244:38 - AWS or Azure it's the same thing okay
244:40 - [Music]
244:45 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
244:47 - and we are looking at Cloud support API
244:49 - and this allows you to integrate Google
244:50 - Cloud's customer care within your
244:52 - organization's CRM so the API supports
244:56 - create and manage support cases list
244:58 - create download attachments for cases
244:59 - list and create comments and cases and
245:03 - so the the cloud support API is
245:05 - available to customer cares with
245:06 - enhanced or premium support so why would
245:09 - you want this well if you have your own
245:10 - CRM right so you use a CRM to have your
245:15 - own cases for customers allows you to
245:17 - kind of centralize all of your case
245:19 - information in one place so that you
245:22 - don't have to have your users or your
245:25 - support team go out and make cases in
245:27 - Google Cloud that you can just integrate
245:29 - directly into a single platform and this
245:31 - is a very unique offering I haven't seen
245:33 - this on AWS I haven't seen this on Azure
245:34 - so this is pretty cool that gcp does
245:36 - this
245:37 - [Music]
245:41 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
245:43 - and we are looking at third-party
245:44 - Technology support for Google Cloud
245:46 - support okay so which third party with
246:15 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
246:17 - and we are looking at third-party
246:19 - Technology support uh for Google Cloud
246:21 - so support will assist you with
246:23 - integrating non-google services and open
246:26 - source technologies that are running on
246:27 - or integrating with Google cloud
246:29 - services and we got three approaches to
246:31 - delivering third-party Technology
246:32 - support so we have collaborative support
246:34 - So Google Cloud partners with other
246:36 - companies to create joint support
246:38 - experience so NetApp Cloud volumes for
246:41 - Google Cloud IBM power F5 Network beat
246:44 - b-i-g-i-p Dell Technologies data Stacks
246:48 - uh Astra data bricks so what Google is
246:51 - saying is that they have Partnerships
246:52 - with these companies and so when it
246:54 - comes to supporting these particular
246:56 - providers they can directly go to the
246:58 - people that make it to get you the best
247:00 - support for it for workload Centric
247:02 - support Google cloud has expertise in a
247:04 - variety of third-party Technologies and
247:06 - consists with the setup configuration
247:08 - troubleshooting of those Technologies so
247:09 - it's just that they're working with
247:10 - stuff every day all day so you know it's
247:13 - just they accumulate that knowledge
247:15 - third-party support So Google Cloud
247:17 - provides commercially reasonably assist
247:19 - with installation configuration and
247:21 - troubleshooting of third-party software
247:23 - so operating systems databases web

252:36 - recommendations for future events to
252:38 - initiate the event management service
252:40 - for an upcoming event contact your Tam
252:42 - but there you go
252:43 - [Music]
252:48 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
252:49 - and we're looking at training credits
252:51 - for premium support so you'll receive
252:54 - training credits for Google Cloud Quick
252:56 - Labs we'll talk about quick labs in a
252:57 - moment that you can distribute to your
252:59 - users in your organization your Tam
253:01 - identifies learning opportunities and
253:03 - indicates which training resources can
253:05 - be most beneficial to your organization
253:06 - with this training your developers have
253:09 - resources to find answers quickly and
253:11 - test out ideas in safe environments so
253:13 - for a one-year contract with premium
253:14 - support you get
253:16 - 6250 credits so just to talk a bit about
253:19 - quick Labs it is a platform that allows
253:22 - you to run Labs so the idea is that it
253:24 - can provision resources for you so you
253:27 - don't have to worry about making a
253:30 - mistake or getting over billed and it'll
253:31 - have a checklist that you can go through
253:33 - to do that so labs are becoming very
253:36 - common with cloud service provider or
253:37 - sorry like training providers even
253:39 - myself I have lab systems but this is
253:42 - one that is owned by Google so they used
253:44 - to have I mean they do they had stuff
253:45 - for AWS Azure gcp but now that Google's
253:48 - bought it it's a lot more Google focused
253:50 - and also they have some free stuff there
253:53 - there's actually ones included for this
253:56 - digital Cloud leader course and they're
253:59 - not very good none of the content is
254:01 - really covered in so those ones in
254:02 - particular aren't very good but that
254:04 - doesn't mean there's not a lot of great
254:05 - content on there so you might want to go
254:07 - check that out okay
254:08 - [Music]
254:12 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
254:14 - and we're looking at new product
254:15 - previews so for premium support
254:17 - customers you have access to previews of
254:19 - new Google Cloud products by proving a
254:22 - product you have an opportunity to
254:23 - prepare your architecture for a new
254:25 - solution before it becomes more broadly
254:26 - available to the market with your
254:28 - organization's goals and Minds your Tam
254:30 - analyzes your Google Cloud projects and
254:32 - usage to identify opportunities to test
254:34 - and use new products and solutions when
254:36 - your Tam identifies an opportunity they
254:38 - introduce you to product teams and you
254:41 - help you gain access to preview as you
254:43 - test the product your Tam also shares
254:45 - your feedback with the product team in
254:47 - addition to working with Tam you can
254:48 - request and manage access to previews
254:50 - via Cloud console in the cloud console
254:52 - you can check the status of your request
254:54 - and manage which users and organizations
254:56 - have access to previews having access to
254:58 - previews is not a big deal I mean like
255:00 - if you use Azure they actually make it
255:03 - very easy for anybody to test out
255:04 - previews and they're rolling that stuff
255:06 - out all the time for AWS you can see
255:09 - previews if you're part of the community
255:12 - Builders program it's not that hard to
255:14 - get in but you have to be a bit active
255:16 - in AWS where you get direct access to
255:19 - people building out the products and
255:21 - seeing the product so it's a bit odd
255:23 - that Google does it this way where it's
255:25 - only for their premium customers but at
255:26 - least they know that people that are
255:28 - Enterprises paying a lot of money
255:29 - they're going to give really good
255:30 - feedback so maybe it's part of their
255:31 - strategy and it works for them
255:33 - [Music]
255:37 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
255:39 - and we're looking at technical account
255:41 - managers also known as Tam I swear we
255:43 - covered this somewhere else but I don't
255:45 - remember where so if it's covered twice
255:47 - that's okay because this one is more of
255:49 - the textbook explanation that Google
255:52 - gives you and I imagine the other one
255:53 - was just me kind of describing tams in
255:55 - general so as a premium support customer
255:57 - you are assigned a technical account
255:59 - manager and also known as a tam and a
256:02 - technical account managers are trusted
256:04 - technical advisors that focus on
256:06 - operational rigor platform Health
256:07 - architectural stability for your
256:09 - organization so Tam support and guide
256:12 - you through in the following ways they
256:14 - can assist you with onboarding to
256:15 - premium support assess your Cloud
256:17 - maturity and works with you to create an
256:20 - adoption roadmap and operational
256:21 - operating model advises you on best
256:24 - practices for Google Cloud delivers
256:26 - frequent operational Health reviews
256:27 - connects you with a technical experts
256:30 - product managers support and Engineers
256:31 - works with you on support cases case
256:34 - escalation high priority cases your Tam
256:37 - will analyze the incident at find the
256:39 - root causes by default you'll receive
256:41 - eight hours per week of foundational
256:43 - technical account management Services if
256:45 - you require more assistance you can
256:47 - purchase additional Tam services but
256:49 - there you go that's the tab and only at
256:51 - the premium support the Enterprise level
256:53 - [Music]
256:57 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
256:59 - and we are looking at Cloud buildings
257:01 - account which is used to define who pays
257:03 - for a given set of Google Cloud
257:04 - resources as connected to a Google
257:06 - payments profile so over here on the
257:09 - right hand side you can see that link so
257:11 - projects are going to be going to your
257:12 - billing account and then your billing
257:13 - account is linked to a payment profile
257:16 - uh if you want to see uh that you can
257:19 - create multiple underpayment profile you
257:21 - create multiple uh billing accounts so
257:22 - here's just a single one but it's very
257:24 - easy to create multiples so building
257:26 - account includes one or more billing
257:28 - contacts predefined in a payments
257:29 - profile Billings can have sub accounts
257:31 - for resellers so you can build resources
257:33 - to be paid by your customer so let's
257:36 - compare the two so that we fully
257:38 - understand these two offerings okay so
257:40 - for cloud billing account it is a cloud
257:42 - level resource managed in the Google
257:44 - Cloud console tracks all of the costs
257:46 - charges and usage credits incurred by
257:48 - the Google Cloud usage a cloud billing
257:51 - account can be linked to one or more
257:52 - projects projects usage is charged to
257:55 - the linked billing billing account
257:57 - results in a single invoice per Cloud
258:00 - billing account operates in a single
258:02 - currency defines who pays for a given
258:04 - set of resources is connected to a
258:06 - Google payments profile which includes
258:08 - payment instructions to find how you pay
258:11 - for charges has billing specific roles
258:13 - and permissions to control accessing and
258:15 - modifying billing related functions so
258:17 - establish I am so on the payments
258:19 - profile side we're over here now it is a
258:22 - Google level resource managed at
258:24 - payments.google.com connects to all of
258:26 - your Google services such as Google ads
258:28 - Google Cloud Phi phone service processes
258:32 - payments for all Google services not
258:34 - just Google Cloud stores information
258:35 - like names address tax ID when required
258:38 - legally or who is responsible for the
258:40 - profile stores your various payment
258:42 - instruments so credit cards debit cards
258:45 - bank accounts other payment methods will
258:47 - be used to buy through Google in the
258:49 - past functions is a document Center
258:51 - where you can view invoices payment
258:52 - history and so on controls who you can
258:55 - view and receive invoices of various
258:58 - Cloud billing accounts and products so
259:00 - hopefully that is clear on the exam
259:03 - they're not going to ask you to choose
259:05 - out of these at a lineup so I wouldn't
259:06 - worry about that it's just more for your
259:08 - benefit okay
259:09 - [Music]
259:13 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
259:15 - and we are looking at billing account
259:16 - types so there are two types of cloud
259:18 - billing accounts we got self-serve or
259:20 - online accounts payment instrument is a
259:23 - credit or debit card ACH uh direct uh
259:26 - debit depending on the availability in
259:29 - each country or region costs are charged
259:31 - automatically to the payment instrument
259:33 - connected to the cloud billing account
259:34 - you can sign up for self-serve accounts
259:37 - online the documents generally for the
259:39 - self-serve account include statements
259:41 - payment receipts tax invoices that are
259:43 - accessible to Google Cloud console then
259:46 - you have invoice or offline accounts so
259:48 - payment instrument can be a check or
259:49 - wire transfer invoices are sent by mail
259:52 - or electronically invoices are also
259:54 - accessible in the cloud console as our
259:57 - payment receipts you must be eligible
259:58 - for invoice billing and you can learn
260:00 - more about it somewhere in the
260:02 - documentation so that's kind of
260:03 - interesting I don't know I don't
260:05 - remember seeing whether AWS or Azure had
260:07 - that but it's cool that you can do that
260:08 - kind of offline method for payment
260:10 - profile types there's two as well we got
260:12 - individual so uh you're using your
260:14 - account for your own personal payments
260:16 - if you register your payment profile as
260:18 - an individual then you can only manage
260:20 - the profile you won't be able to add or
260:22 - remove users or change permissions on
260:24 - the profile and then we have business
260:25 - you're paying on behalf of a business
260:27 - organization partnership or educational
260:29 - institution you use Google payment
260:31 - center to pay for play apps games Google
260:35 - services like Google ads Google Cloud
260:36 - Phi phone service a business profile
260:38 - allows you to add other users to a
260:40 - Google payment
260:42 - profile you manage so that more than one
260:45 - person can access or manage payment
260:47 - profiles
260:48 - all users added to a business profile
260:51 - can see the payment information on that
260:54 - profile so there you go
260:55 - [Music]
260:59 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
261:01 - and we are looking at charging Cycles so
261:03 - for self-serve Cloud billing accounts
261:05 - your Google Cloud chart costs are
261:07 - automatically charged in one of two ways
261:09 - so you either have monthly billing so
261:11 - costs are charged under regular monthly
261:12 - cycle or threshold building costs are
261:15 - charged when your account has occurred a
261:17 - specific amount for self-serve Cloud
261:19 - billing accounts your charging cycle is
261:22 - automatically assigned when you create
261:23 - the account you do not get to choose
261:25 - your charging cycle and you cannot
261:27 - change the charging cycle for invoice uh
261:30 - collab billing accounts your typical
261:32 - receive one invoice per month and the
261:35 - amount of time you have to pay your
261:36 - invoice so your payment terms is
261:38 - determined by the agreement you made
261:40 - with Google so there you go
261:42 - [Music]
261:46 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
261:48 - and we're looking at Cloud billing IM
261:50 - roles so Cloud billing lets you control
261:52 - which users have administrative and cost
261:54 - viewing permissions for specified
261:57 - Resources by setting identity and access
261:59 - management so I am policies on the
262:01 - resources so to Grant or limit access to
262:03 - Cloud billing you can set an IM policy
262:06 - at the organizational level the cloud
262:08 - billing account level or the project
262:09 - level cloud billing roles in IEM include
262:12 - billing account creators so this creates
262:14 - a new self-serve online billing accounts
262:16 - billing account administrator manage
262:19 - billing account so but not be able to
262:20 - create them billing account users so
262:22 - link projects to billing accounts
262:24 - billing account viewers so view billing
262:27 - account cost information and
262:28 - transactions project billing manager so
262:31 - link and unlink the project to and from
262:32 - a billing account billing account
262:35 - cost manager so I can view and Export
262:38 - cost information of billing and the
262:40 - documentation here I've just pulled up
262:42 - one this is for uh Billings admin it
262:45 - just shows you all the permission that
262:47 - are possible okay so stuff I just this
262:49 - is basically a condensed list of all
262:51 - this information all these descriptions
262:52 - and stuff but if you want to have an
262:54 - idea of exactly what you have access to
262:56 - you can see that there okay
262:57 - [Music]
263:02 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
263:04 - and we are looking at billing health
263:06 - checks and also budget alerts so Billy
263:09 - health checks are recommendations to
263:11 - avoid common billing issues so uh within
263:14 - your Billings overview you'll see this
263:16 - billing health checks and it'll say
263:17 - it'll either be read like saying look at
263:19 - these things here are some ideas and
263:21 - things that are good and so over if you
263:23 - click into that you can see a full kind
263:25 - of checklist the first recommendation is
263:27 - to go ahead and create a budget alert so
263:29 - this allows you to make multiple alert
263:31 - thresholds to reduce spending surprise
263:32 - is an unexpected cost overruns lots of
263:35 - great suggestions here but let's take a
263:36 - look more detail at budget alerts so you
263:39 - can narrow down the budget scope to
263:40 - specific projects or specific resources
263:42 - you're going to go ahead and provide a
263:44 - value so here I say a hundred dollars
263:46 - notice that it draws a trend line so you
263:49 - can see where your spend is currently at
263:50 - and you can you set multiple thresholds
263:53 - that preemptively warn you when you
263:55 - approach your budget limits so here I'm
263:57 - saying uh fifty dollars ninety dollars a
263:59 - hundred dollars this is really nice
264:00 - because other cloud service providers
264:03 - what they'll do is you'll just set a a
264:05 - threshold to say a single threshold
264:07 - which is like 20 percent and if you
264:09 - wanted these incremented stuff you'd
264:11 - have to make multiple uh uh budget
264:14 - alerts or or plans or whatever you want
264:17 - to call any other csps but it would cost
264:19 - you more money whereas this one is just
264:20 - you can just do it all in one go which
264:22 - is really nice so notification options
264:24 - so email alerts to billing admin users
264:26 - link monitoring email notification
264:28 - channels to the budget uh connect a pub
264:31 - sub topic to this account this budget so
264:34 - there you go
264:35 - [Music]
264:39 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
264:41 - and I just want to show you how would
264:42 - you get to all the cool building
264:44 - features in Google Cloud console well
264:46 - you just go to billing in the drop down
264:48 - and from there you're gonna have a lot
264:50 - of options but the ones that Google
264:51 - wants to know and you definitely need to
264:53 - know these for the exam are the built-in
264:54 - billing reports there's four that they
264:56 - have in mind so there's billing reports
264:58 - so an interactive pricing Explorer
265:00 - including graph visualization cost table
265:03 - reports a tabular breakdown of the cost
265:04 - to analyze details of invoices cost
265:07 - breakdown report so at a glance
265:09 - waterfall overview of monthly charges
265:10 - and credit pricing report so axis SKU
265:14 - prices for Google cloud services here
265:16 - they are just notice that they're not
265:17 - one to one in terms of naming so that's
265:19 - why I highlighted these in in Black so
265:21 - you could just see like cost table
265:23 - reports is called cost table pricing
265:25 - reports just called pricing things like
265:27 - that okay
265:28 - foreign
265:32 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
265:34 - and we are taking a look at the billing
265:36 - reports in Greater detail here so
265:38 - building report is to view and analyze
265:40 - your Google Cloud usage costs using many
265:43 - selectable settings and filters so
265:45 - configuring various views of cloud
265:47 - billing reports can help you answer
265:48 - questions like these how is my current
265:51 - month's Google Cloud spending trending
265:53 - what Google Cloud project costs the most
265:55 - last month what Google cloud service
265:58 - costs me the most what are my forecasted
266:02 - future costs based on historical Trends
266:04 - how much am I spending by the region
266:07 - what was the cost of resources with
266:10 - label X and you can also have customized
266:13 - report views that are savable and
266:15 - shareable so on the exam they actually
266:17 - might ask you you know like okay you
266:21 - want to do this right which built-in
266:24 - report will let you do that so you need
266:25 - to remember these okay and which they
266:28 - apply to all right
266:29 - [Music]
266:33 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
266:35 - and we are looking at Cost table reports
266:37 - and a costal report is to access and
266:39 - analyze the details of your invoices and
266:41 - statements I know this image is really
266:43 - small but down below it actually shows
266:45 - like kind of like a summary of
266:47 - um costs just like an invoice you can
266:49 - filter that out to understand those
266:50 - totals and things like that so because
266:52 - your generated invoices and statement
266:54 - PDF only contains simple simplified
266:56 - summarized views of your cost the cost
266:58 - table report is available to provide
266:59 - invoice or statement cost details such
267:01 - as the following including project level
267:03 - cost details from your invoices and
267:05 - statements including tax costs broken
267:07 - down out by project includes additional
267:09 - details you might need such as IDs SKU
267:12 - IDs project numbers the report view is
267:15 - customizable and downloadable to a CSV
267:18 - so there you go
267:20 - foreign
267:22 - [Music]
267:23 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
267:25 - and we are looking at cost breakdown
267:27 - reports so a cost breakdown report is an
267:30 - at a glance waterfall overview of your
267:32 - monthly costs and savings so this report
267:34 - shows the following summarized view of
267:37 - monthly charges and credits the combined
267:39 - cost of your monthly Google Cloud usage
267:41 - on-demand rate calculated using
267:42 - non-discounted list prices savings
267:45 - realized on your invoice due to
267:46 - negotiated price if applicable for your
267:49 - Google Cloud billing account
267:51 - savings earned on your invoice with
267:54 - usage-based credits broken down by
267:55 - credit type your invoice level charge is
267:59 - such as tax and adjustments so it's they
268:01 - call it a waterfall because it looks
268:03 - like a waterfall but the idea is like
268:05 - this is just a much clearer view than
268:08 - using billing reports of course you can
268:11 - get the same visualization with billing
268:13 - reports it's just an easier
268:14 - visualization okay
268:15 - [Music]
268:19 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
268:21 - and we are looking at pricing reports so
268:23 - use the pricing table report to access
268:25 - SKU prices for Google cloud services
268:27 - including Google Cloud Google Maps
268:29 - platform Google workspace as of the date
268:32 - the report is viewed the report shows
268:34 - the following pricing information
268:35 - displays SKU prices specific to the
268:38 - selected Cloud billing account if your
268:40 - Cloud billing account has negotiated
268:42 - contract pricing each SKU displays the
268:44 - list price your contract price and your
268:47 - effective discount if an SKU is subject
268:49 - to tiered pricing each pricing tier for
268:51 - an SKU is listed as a separate row all
268:54 - the prices are shown in the currency of
268:55 - the selected billing account and the
268:57 - report view is customizable and
268:59 - downloadable to the csvue for offline
269:01 - analysis
269:02 - [Music]
269:06 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
269:08 - and we are looking at the pricing
269:10 - overview for Google Cloud because they
269:12 - have a lot of different schemes for
269:14 - pricing and it's going to vary for
269:15 - service but we can break it down into
269:17 - seven types of pricing so we have the
269:19 - free trial so this is a risk-free uh
269:22 - trial period with specific limitations
269:23 - uh we have free tier these are services
269:26 - that have a minimum monthly limit or or
269:28 - of free use and then we're more now into
269:31 - compute so if we have on demand the
269:34 - standard price paid per hour minute
269:35 - seconds milliseconds varies per service
269:37 - committed use discounts a lower uh price
269:40 - than on demand for agreeing to one year
269:43 - or three year contract sustained use
269:45 - discounts so these are passive savings
269:47 - when using resources past a period of
269:50 - continuous use preemptable VM instances
269:53 - instances with deep savings but at a
269:55 - cost of being interrupted flat rate
269:57 - pricing so prefer a stable cost of
269:59 - queries rather than paying on demand so
270:01 - this is only in particular for bigquery
270:04 - I don't know if they provide uh plan to
270:05 - do it for other services
270:06 - we have sole tenant node pricing so
270:09 - dedicated compute so this is basically a
270:11 - single tenant virtual machine so for the
270:15 - exam you're going to want to know
270:17 - all of these pretty well uh like broadly
270:20 - speaking these two aren't going to show
270:22 - up on the exam but uh we're going to
270:25 - cover them anyway just for your own
270:26 - benefit okay
270:27 - [Music]
270:32 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
270:33 - and we are looking at free trial and
270:35 - also free tier so this is going to show
270:38 - up on the exam but it's for your own
270:40 - benefit so when you sign up for Google
270:41 - Cloud you are going to get 90 days free
270:45 - for 300 of credits on the platform that
270:48 - you can use towards uh different types
270:50 - of products and services and so there
270:53 - are some limitations to this trial that
270:55 - we need to go through you cannot use
270:57 - these on gpus to your VM instances gpus
271:00 - is generally used for machine learning
271:02 - or deep learning you can't request a
271:04 - quota increase so you get 300 bucks or
271:06 - credits and that's all you get you can't
271:08 - create VM instances that are based on
271:11 - Windows Server images
271:12 - you you need to verify a credit card or
271:15 - other payment method to sign up and at
271:18 - the end of your trial to continue using
271:19 - Google Cloud you must upgrade to a paid
271:21 - Cloud billing account upgrading early
271:24 - will end your trial because you really
271:25 - are in a sandbox to keep you safe that's
271:28 - one of the benefits of Google Cloud
271:30 - where other providers like AWS you have
271:33 - a high chance of going over your free
271:36 - trial into real spend okay so for free
271:40 - tier all Google Cloud customers can use
271:43 - select Google Cloud products like
271:45 - compute engine cloud storage bigquery
271:46 - free of charge within a specified
271:49 - monthly usage limits when you stay
271:51 - within the free tier the resources are
271:53 - not charged against your free true
271:54 - credits to your Cloud billing accounts
271:56 - payments method after your trial ends
271:58 - okay
272:00 - so for app engine we have 28 hours per
272:04 - day for f instances nine hours a day for
272:07 - B instances one gigabyte of egress so
272:10 - data leaving the network like downloads
272:14 - the Google Cloud free tier is available
272:17 - only for the standard environment so
272:18 - it's not for flexible for artifact
272:20 - registry you have 0.5 gigabytes of
272:23 - storage per month for auto ml natural
272:25 - language you get 5000 units of
272:27 - prediction per month for auto ml tables
272:30 - you get six nodes hours of training and
272:32 - prediction for auto ml translation you
272:35 - get 500 000 translated characters per
272:37 - month for automl video intelligence you
272:40 - get 40 node hours for training five
272:43 - hours for prediction for auto ml Vision
272:46 - you get 40 node hours of training and
272:49 - online prediction one hour for batch
272:52 - classification prediction 15 node hours
272:54 - for Edge training for bigquery you get
272:57 - one terabytes of querying per month and
272:59 - to me that is like super awesome and one
273:02 - of the reasons why I like to use
273:05 - bigquery as my primary data warehouse
273:07 - you get 10 gigabytes of storage per
273:10 - month for cloud build you get 120 build
273:12 - minutes per day for cloud functions you
273:14 - get 2 million invocations per month
273:16 - includes both background and HTTP
273:18 - invocations 400
273:20 - 000 gigabyte seconds 200
273:22 - 000 or yeah 200 000 gigahertz seconds uh
273:27 - gigahertz is that GH said I think that's
273:29 - what it is seconds of compute time five
273:31 - gigabytes Network egress per month for
273:34 - cloud logging and Cloud monitoring you
273:36 - get free monthly logging allotment free
273:39 - monthly metrics allotment for natural
273:42 - language you get 5000 units per month
273:45 - for cloud run you get 2 million requests
273:47 - per month 360
273:49 - 000 gigabytes per second of memory 180
273:52 - 180 000 of ecpu seconds of compute time
273:55 - one gigabyte Network egress from uh
273:58 - North America per month and the free
274:00 - tier is available only for cloud Run
274:03 - Okay free access to Cloud shell uh
274:07 - including five gigabytes persistent disk
274:10 - storage so don't fear spinning up Cloud
274:12 - shell it's a very useful tool uh Cloud
274:15 - Source repository so up to five users 50
274:19 - gigabytes of storage 50 gigabytes of
274:21 - egress for cloud Vision 1000 units per
274:24 - month for firestore one gigabytes
274:26 - storage per month
274:28 - um or just in general sorry not per
274:30 - month 50 000 reads to twenty thousand
274:33 - rights twenty thousand deletes per day
274:35 - for Google kubernetes engine no cluster
274:38 - management fee and that's a big one
274:40 - because other providers will charge you
274:42 - a management fee for the cluster or
274:45 - control plane for autopilot or its own
274:47 - clusters per billing account for
274:49 - clusters created in autopilot mode pods
274:52 - are billed per second CPUs memory
274:55 - resources requests for clusters created
274:57 - in standard mode each user node is
274:59 - charged at a standard compute engine
275:01 - pricing
275:02 - for cloud storage five gigabytes per
275:04 - month of regional storage so that's
275:05 - pretty good but only for the US regions
275:07 - 5000 Class A operations per month 50 000
275:10 - Class B operations per month one
275:13 - gigabyte Network egress from North
275:14 - America to All Region destinations
275:16 - excluding China and Australia per month
275:18 - free tier is only available in UFC's 1
275:21 - US West one U.S Central regions uses
275:25 - calculations are combined across those
275:27 - regions last page I believe of our free
275:30 - tier here so for Google Maps you're
275:33 - getting 10 gigabytes messages per month
275:34 - for speech to text 60 Minutes a video
275:37 - intelligence API 1000 units per month
275:40 - for work workflows 5000 internal steps
275:42 - per month 2000 external HTTP calls per
275:45 - month per compute engine one
275:47 - non-preemptable F1 micro VM instance per
275:49 - month within us West U.S Central one U.S
275:53 - east one 30 gigabytes uh months hhd area
275:56 - hard disk drive five gigabytes months uh
276:00 - snap uh snapshot storage in the
276:01 - following regions
276:03 - one gigabyte Network egress your free
276:06 - tier F1 micro instance is limited by
276:09 - time not by instance so each month
276:12 - eligible used for F1 micro instances is
276:14 - free until you have used the number of
276:16 - hours equal to that so just remember F1
276:19 - micro when you're looking for a free
276:20 - instance usage calculations are combined
276:22 - across supported regions Google Cloud
276:25 - free tier does not include external IP
276:28 - addresses
276:30 - um
276:31 - uh compute engine offers discounts for
276:33 - sustainable use of virtual machines your
276:36 - free tier does uh use doesn't factor
276:39 - into sustained use gpus and tpus are not
276:42 - included in the free tier offers you're
276:43 - always charged for gpus and tpus that
276:46 - you add VM instances and that makes
276:48 - sense because their physical pieces of
276:49 - Hardware they're really expensive okay
276:51 - [Music]
276:55 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
276:57 - and we are looking at on-demand pricing
276:59 - so this is when you pay for a Google
277:00 - Cloud resource based on a
277:02 - consumption-based Model A
277:03 - consumption-based model means you only
277:05 - pay for what you use based on a
277:07 - consumption metric so that could be
277:09 - hourly minute seconds milliseconds can
277:12 - be a multiplied by configuration
277:14 - variables such as vcpus or memory by API
277:18 - calls so maybe one dollar every one
277:19 - thousand transactions On Demand is ideal
277:21 - for low cost and it's because it's low
277:24 - cost and flexible only pay per hour
277:26 - short term spiky unpredictable workloads
277:29 - cannot be interrupted and for first-time
277:31 - apps so generally it's the one you
277:33 - usually use okay
277:34 - [Music]
277:39 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
277:40 - and we are looking at committed use
277:42 - discounts also known as cuds and this
277:44 - lets you commit to a contract for deeply
277:46 - discounted virtual machines on the
277:48 - Google compute engine it's simple and
277:50 - flexible and requires no upfront costs
277:52 - ideal for workloads with predictable
277:53 - resources needs you purchase compute
277:56 - resources so vcpus memory gpus local
277:59 - ssds discounts apply to the aggregate
278:02 - number of vcpus memory gpus and local
278:04 - ssds with your region not affected by
278:07 - changes to your instance machine setup
278:09 - you commit for payment terms one year to
278:11 - three years purchase a committed use
278:13 - contract for a single project purchase
278:15 - multiple contract share across many
278:17 - projects by enabling shared discounts
278:19 - your billed monthly for the resources
278:21 - you purchase for the duration of the
278:22 - term whether or not you've actually used
278:24 - the service as a is it's going to happen
278:26 - anyway okay so 57 is most machine
278:31 - types and gpus and 70 is a memory
278:34 - optimized machine types so look here on
278:37 - the right hand side just to give you an
278:39 - idea so the idea is that when you want
278:41 - to do committed use you choose the
278:43 - product that you want you're going to
278:44 - choose the plan that you want the region
278:46 - and the commitment and then it's going
278:49 - to tell you your estimated savings okay
278:52 - [Music]
278:56 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
278:58 - and we are looking at sustained used
278:59 - discounts also known as Suds and these
279:02 - are automatic discounts for running
279:04 - specific compute engine resources for a
279:06 - significant portion of the billing month
279:08 - so sustain use discounts apply to the
279:10 - following resources and this is broken
279:12 - into two broad categories the first is
279:14 - vcpus and memories when you're dealing
279:16 - with these two components you have
279:18 - General person custom and predefined
279:19 - machine types such as you going in and
279:21 - dropping down different types of
279:23 - machines compute optimize machine types
279:25 - memory optimized machine types sold
279:28 - tenant nodes remember that's kind of
279:29 - like dedicated machines
279:31 - and so here it's 10 Premium cost even if
279:34 - the vcpus and memory in those nodes are
279:36 - covered by the committed use discounts
279:38 - uh and then the other part here is that
279:39 - there's ones for GPU devices so you can
279:42 - apply Suds to gpus which is a great
279:45 - savings okay applied on incremental use
279:48 - after each reach certain usage
279:51 - thresholds you pay only for the number
279:53 - of minutes that you use an instance
279:54 - compute engines automatically give you
279:56 - uh the best price there's no reason to
279:59 - run an instance longer for than you need
280:01 - it automatically apply to the VMS
280:03 - created by both Google kubernetes engine
280:05 - and compute engine and it does not apply
280:07 - to VMS created using App engine's
280:09 - flexible environment and data flow okay
280:12 - but what I want to remember is that Suds
280:14 - is if you keep on using something you're
280:17 - going to save money and it's going to be
280:19 - particular with most CPU types most
280:23 - compute types and gpus okay
280:26 - um oh it also does not apply to E2 and
280:28 - A2 machine types I missed that there in
280:31 - the end uh so uh just to kind of give
280:33 - you an idea of what kind of savings you
280:35 - can expect so there's ones for up to 30
280:37 - and that's when you're using general
280:39 - purpose and one predefining custom
280:40 - machine types memory optimized machine
280:42 - types shared core machine types Soul
280:45 - tenant nodes and so here's kind of the
280:47 - idea of uses level uh based on also the
280:49 - incremental charge okay and then we have
280:53 - sustained discounts for 20 so general
280:55 - purpose N2 and 2D predefined custom
280:57 - types computer optimized types and then
281:00 - another graph so for the exam they're
281:02 - not you're not going to need to know
281:03 - these details but you just need to know
281:05 - segs you save money uh when you have
281:08 - continued use okay foreign
281:13 - [Music]
281:14 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
281:16 - and we are looking at flat rate pricing
281:18 - and this is only for bigquery uh would
281:21 - it be ever be for any other service I
281:23 - don't think so but the idea here is that
281:25 - if you have high volume or Enterprise
281:26 - customers who prefer a stable monthly
281:28 - cost for queries rather than paying on
281:30 - demand price per gigabyte of data
281:32 - process this is where flat rate pricing
281:33 - comes into play so you have purchase
281:35 - dedicated query processing capacity
281:37 - measured in bigquery slots your queries
281:39 - are con the idea here is you consume
281:42 - your queries uh via this capacity and
281:45 - you are not built for bytes process if
281:46 - your capacity demands exceed your
281:48 - committed capacity bigquery will queue
281:50 - up slots and you will not be charged
281:52 - additional fees to enable this flat rate
281:55 - price uh yeah the slide doesn't want to
281:58 - go forward there but to enable the flat
282:00 - rate pricing use bigquery reservations
282:03 - so there you go
282:04 - [Music]
282:08 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
282:10 - and we are looking at sole tenant node
282:12 - pricing so a sole tenant node a single a
282:15 - single tenant virtual machine is
282:17 - physical compute engine server that is
282:19 - dedicated to hosting your own projects
282:22 - VM instance you've heard me mention sold
282:23 - tenant many times in this course when
282:25 - you create a soul tenant node your build
282:27 - for all of the vcpus and memory
282:29 - resources on the sole tenant nodes plus
282:32 - a sole tenancy premium which is 10 of
282:34 - the cost of all the underlying vcpus and
282:36 - memory resources it does for sustained
282:39 - use discounts applied to this premium
282:40 - but committed use to discounts do not
282:42 - after you create the node you can place
282:45 - the VM on that node and then these VMS
282:47 - run for no additional cost of vcpus and
282:50 - gigabytes of memory are charged a
282:52 - minimum of one minute after one minute
282:54 - of use Soul tenant nodes are built in
282:56 - one second increments the price of a
282:58 - node type depends on the following so
283:00 - number of vcpus of the node type
283:02 - gigabytes of memory of the node types
283:04 - region where you create the nodes so
283:07 - we'll sold tenant show up on the exam
283:09 - probably so just make sure you
283:10 - understand you don't need to remember
283:12 - all the details to it but remember just
283:13 - understand what it is and generally how
283:15 - expensive it is okay
283:16 - [Music]
283:21 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
283:23 - and we are looking at the Google pricing
283:25 - calculator so this is a free web-based
283:27 - cost calculating tool to generally
283:28 - calculate costs of various gcp resources
283:31 - so you do not need a gcp account to use
283:33 - this tool you can create a shareable
283:35 - link or email the estimate to your
283:37 - organization or key stakeholders so this
283:40 - is generally what it looks like you
283:41 - choose the service so here I say I want
283:42 - two instances and there's other
283:44 - particular details and then it's going
283:46 - to generate a cost so here it's saying
283:48 - it's 97 you can email it you can change
283:51 - the currency very straightforward so
283:54 - there you go foreign
283:58 - [Music]
284:00 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
284:01 - and we are looking at the concept of
284:03 - resource hierarchy within gcp so this is
284:07 - kind of a graphic of what a hierarchy
284:09 - could look like and there's a lot of
284:11 - components that go into it we did cover
284:13 - this a little bit earlier in one slide
284:15 - about folders where we talked about
284:17 - folders projects and resources there's a
284:20 - lot of moving Parts here and on the exam
284:21 - they're definitely going to ask you
284:23 - about resource hierarchies so let's make
284:25 - sure we know this okay
284:26 - first thing is a resource is a service
284:28 - level service level resources that are
284:31 - used to process your workloads could be
284:32 - bigquery compute engine whatever uh that
284:35 - is a service you want to launch and you
284:37 - have Resource Management how you should
284:38 - configure and Grant access to Cloud
284:40 - resources from your team set up and or
284:43 - or team set up an organization of your
284:45 - account level resources you have domains
284:48 - primary identity of your organization to
284:51 - find which users should be associated
284:52 - with your org your universally
284:54 - administered policy for your users and
284:56 - devices linked to either a Google
284:59 - workspace or a cloud identity account a
285:02 - Google workspace or Cloud identity
285:03 - account can only have one org just so
285:06 - you know then you have orgs or
285:07 - organizations these are the root nodes
285:09 - of your Google Cloud hierarchy of
285:11 - resources you can Define settings
285:12 - permissions policies for all projects
285:15 - folders resources Cloud billing account
285:16 - is its parent organization is associated
285:20 - with exactly one domain using the
285:22 - organization you can essentially manage
285:24 - your Google Cloud resources and users
285:26 - access with proactive and reactive
285:28 - management then you have folders this is
285:30 - a logical grouping of projects and other
285:32 - uh or other folders folders can be used
285:35 - to group resources that share common IM
285:37 - policies you got projects so logical
285:39 - grouping of service level resources
285:41 - products can represent teams
285:44 - environments organizational units
285:45 - business departments and this is
285:47 - basically where resource hierarchy is
285:49 - very
285:50 - detailed in its variants basis of
285:53 - enabling services apis and IIA and
285:55 - permissions a service level resource
285:57 - resource can only belong to a single
285:59 - project you got labels so categorize and
286:02 - filter your resources with key value
286:04 - pairs if you use AWS or Azure they call
286:07 - these tags okay but here at gcp they
286:09 - call them labels great for cost tracking
286:11 - at a granular level there are three
286:13 - suggested architecturals you can use
286:15 - environment oriented function oriented
286:18 - and granular access oriented they're not
286:20 - going to ask you what kind of
286:22 - architecture it is but they're going to
286:25 - talk about these like saying like which
286:27 - would be a good setup and they'll
286:29 - describe kind of what the the setup
286:31 - would be and that's why you want to know
286:33 - these three types and we'll go over to
286:35 - the docs to look at that because that's
286:37 - where the most detail is for this okay
286:39 - [Music]
286:43 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
286:45 - and we're looking at environment
286:46 - oriented hierarchy and so this is the
286:48 - most simple uh simplest one to implement
286:50 - and pretty much what you would think
286:52 - that you would want to do and so the
286:54 - idea here is you have a single
286:55 - organization and you're going to break
286:57 - up your folders into different
286:58 - environments so production quality
287:00 - assurance and development and then
287:01 - underneath you're going to run your
287:03 - application so this works pretty well in
287:05 - a very simple setup but it can pose
287:07 - challenges if you have to deploy
287:09 - services that are shared by multiple
287:11 - environments okay
287:12 - [Music]
287:16 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
287:18 - and we're looking at function oriented
287:20 - hierarchy so this one looks a little bit
287:22 - more complicated but the idea here is
287:23 - that you have one organization that
287:25 - contains one folder per business
287:28 - function okay so notice here uh we have
287:32 - apps management and infrastructure
287:35 - technology and then the idea is that
287:37 - down below now we can Define production
287:39 - uh our environments as another layer of
287:41 - folders you have folders inside a
287:43 - folders so each business function folder
287:45 - can contain multiple environment folders
287:47 - multiple business functions are apps
287:50 - management and information technology
287:52 - more flexible compared to environment
287:54 - oriented gives you the same environment
287:56 - separation allows you to deploy shared
287:59 - services function oriented hierarchy is
288:01 - more complex to manage than an
288:02 - environment oriented and it's separate
288:04 - access by business so there you go
288:07 - [Music]
288:11 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
288:13 - and we are looking at granular access
288:15 - oriented hierarchy so this one's a
288:17 - little bit larger we have three layers
288:18 - of folders and so the idea here is we
288:21 - have one organization organization that
288:23 - contains folders per business unit so
288:25 - now as you can see here it's retail risk
288:29 - management Financial commercial I know
288:31 - it's hard to read but it's hard to fit
288:33 - that whole image in there each business
288:35 - unit can contain one folder per business
288:37 - function so now we have our function so
288:39 - application sandbox shared uh core
288:42 - Services data analysis controlled
288:44 - services and each business function
288:46 - folder can contain one folder per
288:48 - environment so production development
288:50 - Etc so this is the most flexible and
288:53 - accessible option you need to spend a
288:55 - greater effort to manage the structure
288:57 - rules and permissions
288:59 - um the network topology is more complex
289:01 - so really like when you're looking at it
289:04 - the idea is that we had the three three
289:07 - types so the first one was environment
289:08 - oriented so this is the environment then
289:11 - you had function oriented over here and
289:13 - then this one here is granular access
289:15 - oriented so the idea is that you're just
289:18 - adding additional folders for
289:19 - Organization for organizing your
289:21 - resources okay
289:22 - [Music]
289:27 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
289:29 - and we are doing the gcp follow along so
289:32 - the idea here is that we are going to uh
289:34 - just launch a bunch of cloud services uh
289:37 - it's not going to be super challenging
289:38 - but the idea is just to kind of help
289:39 - cement the uh the knowledge of what
289:41 - we've learned in the lecture content
289:42 - they don't even recommend uh necessary
289:45 - uh for the exam but I like to do it and
289:48 - I think that you'll appreciate doing it
289:49 - too so once you've created your GCB
289:51 - account you should have an organization
289:53 - and a default project and so one of the
289:57 - first things I want to show you how to
289:58 - do is to set up a resource hierarchy
290:01 - because the idea is you have your Cloud
290:03 - workloads below which run in projects
290:05 - and you can organize them into folders
290:08 - and this is all tied to your
290:10 - organization and this is a little bit
290:12 - tricky and it does show up in the exam
290:14 - so it's important to know how to do this
290:16 - and so that's the first thing I really
290:18 - want to show you so what we'll do is
290:21 - we'll go ahead and make our way over to
290:22 - IEM because that's how we do it and it's
290:25 - not going to work and I'm going to show
290:25 - you why and then we're going to show you
290:27 - how to I get permissions okay so we'll
290:28 - go to IEM and on the left hand side if
290:31 - you expand it down below there's one
290:33 - that says manage resources now you could
290:35 - also go up here and type in manage
290:37 - resources because sometimes it's really
290:39 - hard to find things in gcp so you just
290:41 - have to kind of work those two ways the
290:44 - idea is I have a bunch of projects in
290:45 - here and I have my organization and I
290:47 - want to go ahead and create a folder and
290:49 - so I might have a folder coming back
290:51 - over to our structure here
290:52 - we might want to have a folder like
290:55 - applications and then production
290:58 - so if I try application here
291:01 - and my organization selected
291:04 - notice that I have this little Caution
291:06 - sign says you do not have the required
291:07 - permissions
291:09 - resourcemanager.folders.create
291:10 - permission to create folders in this
291:12 - location so you go okay well how do I
291:14 - get permissions I would think that if
291:15 - I'm the owner I'd have permission to
291:16 - everything but that's not the case so if
291:18 - we make our way back to IEM all right we
291:21 - go all the way back here and we go we're
291:24 - under the top one here which is for the
291:26 - users and we see I have the owner role
291:29 - if you look up the documentation it's
291:30 - going to say go ahead and add project or
291:33 - admin folder
291:34 - okay so you go admin folder or project
291:36 - folder and nothing's going to appear and
291:38 - the reason why is that you can apply
291:40 - permissions or roles at the project
291:43 - level and also the organization level
291:45 - and because of that the the roles that
291:47 - are available are different so you're
291:49 - never going to find it at the project
291:50 - level here and so we got to do is go to
291:52 - your organization
291:54 - all right the way you know that you're
291:55 - in your org right now is that it has
291:57 - this little
291:58 - um building and notice now it's just
292:01 - listing uh people at the organizational
292:02 - level and so what I can do here is go
292:04 - ahead and edit the member I'm going to
292:06 - add a role I'm just going to type in
292:08 - folder
292:10 - okay and so now we have folder admin
292:13 - that's going to give me full access full
292:15 - control to create uh what I wanted to do
292:18 - there which was folders now if we go to
292:19 - the left hand side here and go to manage
292:21 - resources we should have an easier time
292:23 - creating folders now and so we'll go
292:25 - ahead here and call this application
292:28 - okay we'll hit create
292:31 - and give it a moment to create
292:34 - and what we'll need to do is go ahead
292:36 - and refresh to see that new folder and
292:38 - there it is so now that we have that
292:39 - folder let's go ahead and create a
292:41 - folder within that folder so I think
292:43 - yeah if we go ahead and hit create
292:44 - folder here
292:46 - and we'll choose our organizational
292:48 - structure
292:50 - oops uh so sorry so I gotta go and
292:53 - choose the org and then now what we can
292:55 - do is choose the folder so I want
292:57 - application here and following our guide
292:59 - here we're going to go with let's say
293:01 - developments
293:03 - because we're not serious about it
293:04 - running any kind of production workloads
293:06 - today we'll go ahead and create that
293:12 - okay we'll go ahead and hit refresh down
293:15 - below and now you can see we have
293:16 - application development so let's say we
293:19 - want to move
293:21 - um or let's say let's we want to create
293:23 - a new project that's going to sit uh in
293:25 - here for our development workload and So
293:27 - Below down below uh you might want to
293:30 - specify the names but what I'm going to
293:32 - do is create a new one in here and I'll
293:35 - say create project
293:36 - and this is just going to be my app uh
293:41 - and we will choose its location
293:46 - okay we'll hit create
293:53 - and it takes it doesn't take that much
293:55 - time for these to build so uh if we give
293:58 - this a hard refresh there's a refresh
294:00 - button up here we should now see our uh
294:03 - R by app so if we go back to gcp you're
294:06 - up the top here I should be able to
294:08 - switch over to my app
294:09 - all right and so now what we'll do is go
294:12 - ahead and create stuff there but that's
294:14 - what I just wanted to show you was the
294:16 - fact that you had that folders and
294:18 - project structure and how easy it was to
294:20 - create in some of those headaches there
294:23 - um I can't remember you probably can
294:24 - apply permissions at the folder level
294:25 - let's just go take a look I'm not
294:27 - running crazy workloads in
294:30 - um gctv so I don't always know but uh
294:32 - what we'll do is go back to the resource
294:34 - manager manage resources here and I
294:37 - think you can
294:40 - yeah I'm not sure but it's not really in
294:42 - the scope of this certification but the
294:44 - idea is we have our project set up and I
294:46 - will make my way back to that and now
294:48 - we'll start launching some resources
294:49 - okay
294:50 - [Music]
294:54 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
294:56 - and we are on the gcp fall Longs for the
294:59 - digital Cloud leader and actually before
295:01 - we launch any resources I probably
295:02 - should show you a bit about uh spend and
295:05 - how to control your spend so this is a
295:07 - new project that we started up and
295:08 - there's nothing really in it now I was
295:10 - playing around in this other sample
295:12 - project here called exam Pro and I
295:14 - purposely ran a bill so I could show you
295:16 - what building looks like uh because it
295:18 - doesn't make a lot of sense like it's
295:19 - very hard to understand it if there's no
295:21 - billing happening so the left hand side
295:24 - you'll go to billing
295:27 - all right and we'll just give it a
295:30 - moment to load here and so we have a
295:31 - bunch of different options here so
295:32 - reports cost tables cost breakdowns
295:34 - commitments etc etc uh and so for the
295:38 - exam you're going to want to know about
295:41 - um the different types of reports the
295:42 - overview reports cost table cost
295:44 - breakdown and generally understand the
295:46 - differences they're pretty thoroughly
295:48 - covered in electric content so uh you
295:50 - know it's not a big deal if you don't
295:51 - absorb it here but the idea here is we
295:55 - can see and this is just the overview we
295:57 - have our cost Trends so we have some
295:59 - nice charts here so it's just kind of
296:02 - like a breakdown so maybe top products
296:03 - things like that it's very
296:04 - straightforward but over here on the
296:06 - right hand side we have billing health
296:07 - checks and so if we were to
296:09 - click this here it's going to give us a
296:12 - bunch of suggestions that we should do
296:14 - and so the first is Grant access to view
296:16 - billing reports assign multiple billing
296:18 - account administrators turn off billing
296:21 - account Creator roll for domain set up a
296:23 - budgets alerts link a project or close
296:26 - an unused account so I would say that
296:30 - studying about budget alert is on our
296:32 - high priority here because we do not
296:33 - want to end up spending more than we
296:36 - have so if we go over to budget alerts
296:39 - over here you can see I have my spending
296:40 - limit and showing that I've spent two
296:43 - dollars and 43 cents out of a hundred
296:45 - dollars so if we wanted to go ahead and
296:46 - create ourselves a budget it's pretty
296:48 - darn easy I'll just say my second budget
296:51 - alert okay see I had a lot of spend the
296:54 - other month there and now I don't have
296:56 - so much
296:57 - um but the idea here is you can go and
296:59 - say okay do I want to take into account
297:01 - credits or not credits would be if you
297:03 - were given gcp credits to utilize for
297:06 - free a lot of times startups get those
297:07 - but the idea is you can go ahead and hit
297:09 - next then you can specify the exact
297:12 - amount and so I could say fifty dollars
297:14 - right and it shows you a line where it
297:16 - can go we'll hit next and this is really
297:19 - nice which I like you don't see this in
297:21 - like AWS where you actually have to set
297:23 - up separate building alarms but in gcp
297:26 - you just if you just can do it all in
297:28 - one go so the idea is if you want
297:29 - multiples you just add multiple
297:31 - thresholds and it's going to warn you
297:33 - when it approaches those numbers and if
297:36 - you go down below you can see that you
297:37 - can email receive emails about it and if
297:41 - you also want to push it to Pub sub you
297:43 - could do that so you could pragmatically
297:45 - code it into your platform in terms of
297:48 - the exam you just need to know that you
297:50 - can set thresholds and why you'd want to
297:52 - use budgets right just to make sure
297:54 - you're monitoring your spend now I don't
297:56 - need to go ahead and create one because
297:57 - I already have one it's a very simple
297:59 - process but that is budget alerts now if
298:02 - we go back over here to reports
298:04 - uh this is really cool this is basically
298:07 - a great way of visualizing your data so
298:10 - you have a bunch of different options
298:11 - and you can really Pare down and say
298:13 - okay I want to know exactly what the
298:15 - spend was for this uh service uh and
298:17 - stuff like that so if you really want to
298:19 - do visuals that's what you'd use that
298:21 - reports tab for then you have your cost
298:24 - table
298:26 - and cost table is basically like a
298:28 - dynamic invoice so the idea is like
298:30 - invoices just aren't able to show you
298:32 - all of the line items and so here we can
298:35 - go and expand and see every single uh
298:38 - every single charge at a granular layer
298:41 - and I'm pretty sure you can export this
298:44 - download here yeah download it as a CSV
298:47 - so it's a better way to um uh like uh
298:50 - review your bill from like an invoice
298:53 - perspective then you have cost breakdown
298:55 - and this is kind of like just a
298:57 - simplified report so like we have
298:59 - reports up here and uh and the overview
299:01 - but this is just more so kind of so you
299:03 - can see it at a glance per month so is
299:05 - it up is it down where are we right so
299:07 - not super complicated
299:10 - um and again the questions are not hard
299:12 - in the exam but really all I wanted to
299:14 - show you was those four there and how to
299:16 - set a budgeted alert and that's pretty
299:18 - much all we need to know so what I'm
299:20 - going to do is make my way back to my
299:21 - sample project and now we're ready to
299:24 - launch some resources okay foreign
299:26 - [Music]
299:30 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
299:32 - and let's go take a look at compute
299:34 - engine so what I want you to do is go to
299:36 - the top left corner here onto our
299:38 - hamburger menu and we'll scroll down
299:40 - make our way over to compute engine and
299:41 - go to VM instances
299:43 - so this is where we would launch a
299:45 - virtual machine so we'll give it a
299:47 - moment here to load and as you can see
299:49 - I've never used it within this project
299:51 - so pretty often you'll have to go ahead
299:53 - hit enable so you are agreeing to use a
299:56 - particular service every time you create
299:57 - a project it's always going to show you
299:59 - that but we'll give it a moment to allow
300:02 - us to use that API it just takes a
300:05 - little bit of time and I don't know why
300:07 - sometimes the UI is a little bit buggy
300:11 - um sometimes it freezes like this and so
300:13 - if it does do that what you'll need to
300:15 - do is just go ahead and hit refresh it's
300:17 - usually pretty darn good the experience
300:18 - is usually pretty smooth but not always
300:20 - the case so I'm going to go ahead and
300:22 - hit enable again
300:25 - okay and it just does not want to work
300:27 - right now
300:30 - so if that happens
300:31 - and it's totally possible that can
300:33 - happen what I recommend is just step
300:35 - away go get a tea go get a coffee and
300:38 - come on back because it'll probably work
300:39 - in just a bit okay I'll see you back in
300:41 - a moment all right so uh after a short
300:44 - tea break I'm back and it's now just all
300:47 - of a sudden working so uh that's the
300:49 - thing with these large cloud service
300:51 - providers is that their services are so
300:53 - massive it's very common to run into
300:56 - inconsistencies in the UI where you
300:58 - think you've done something but it's
300:59 - telling you you haven't but you know you
301:01 - have and so you have to have confidence
301:03 - knowing okay I did do this and just give
301:05 - it a little bit of patience and time uh
301:07 - and just check in again and so here you
301:09 - can see you actually launched multiple
301:10 - times because I pressed the button four
301:12 - times so actually worked the first time
301:13 - but here we are and if you want a quick
301:16 - start you can you can hit this button
301:18 - here and the thing is is that gcp and
301:20 - only gcp does this but they have a
301:22 - really really good tutorial system so if
301:24 - you want to be shown around anything you
301:26 - can hit show me now uh and it'll it'll
301:28 - help you step through all the things
301:30 - that you need to know and so this one is
301:32 - just kind of like a tutorial on how to
301:34 - do something I'm not going to go through
301:36 - it this is more for you this is how to
301:38 - do a to-do app with mongodb I don't like
301:40 - mongodb so I'm not doing that today but
301:42 - I just want you to know that's a great
301:44 - way to start learning with gcp
301:46 - um but what we'll do and you can see we
301:48 - have different instances here so VM
301:50 - instance templates Soul tenants those
301:52 - are dedicated machines machine images
301:54 - Etc tpus but what we want to do is just
301:56 - go ahead and create ourselves a regular
301:58 - old virtual machine so go ahead and hit
302:01 - create instance
302:02 - and we'll give it a moment here
302:05 - today is a slow day for gcp it's usually
302:07 - super fast
302:09 - and here we're in here and so on the
302:12 - left hand side we have new VM instance
302:14 - new VM instances from template new VM
302:16 - instance from machine image or the
302:18 - marketplace now uh I really like how gcp
302:21 - uh shows their
302:24 - um forums compared to AWS and Azure
302:26 - because they're always like on one
302:28 - screen and they're very good about
302:30 - showing you the price uh which is really
302:32 - nice uh and here you can do you get a
302:34 - breakdown to kind of see where the
302:36 - hidden costs are so it's not just the
302:37 - CPU cost that it's just like there is a
302:40 - persistent disk uh and maybe if you're
302:43 - using sustained you just use discount if
302:45 - you've used it on a monthly basis it'll
302:46 - show your savings notice it's like a
302:48 - negative so it would show you a reduced
302:51 - cost there but the idea here is that we
302:53 - want to name our instance I'm going to
302:54 - just say my website okay
302:58 - we'll see if it takes that we can add
303:00 - labels labels are tags so I can go here
303:03 - and say
303:04 - um
303:05 - EnV production we'll go ahead and add
303:08 - that label other provide providers call
303:11 - them tags for some reason gcp wants to
303:13 - call them labels but it's the same thing
303:15 - notice we can choose our region so I'm
303:18 - going to see if there is a Canada region
303:19 - I'm pretty sure there is I just started
303:21 - typing as if I was on Azure and that's
303:23 - not the case I got to scroll on down and
303:24 - look for it I know there's a Montreal
303:26 - there's always a Montreal right there at
303:28 - the top and so I can choose between my
303:31 - zones I'm going to stick with Zone a
303:33 - notice we have general purpose and
303:35 - compute optimized uh notice as soon as I
303:37 - want to compute optimized 135 dollars
303:39 - we'll make our way back E2 is I believe
303:42 - the most cost effective uh instances
303:45 - another thing that's really nice about
303:46 - gcp is they just have fewer fewer things
303:49 - to look at so it's just a lot easier to
303:52 - get set up here but this is good for me
303:54 - I don't need a two vcpus and four
303:58 - gigabyte memory I want to go super small
304:00 - so I'll click on that now I'm down to
304:02 - seven dollars and 83 cents I'm a lot
304:04 - more comfortable about comfortable with
304:06 - that we'll scroll on down so
304:07 - confidential VM Services enable the
304:09 - confidential Computing service on this
304:11 - VM so this service adds protection to
304:14 - your data in use by keeping memory of
304:16 - the VM encrypted with keys that Google
304:17 - doesn't have access to that sounds
304:19 - really good so you can see we can check
304:21 - box that on and we'd have some
304:23 - additional settings we're not going to
304:24 - do that today but I think that's really
304:25 - cool this is something I really like is
304:27 - that any kind of most instances I think
304:29 - most like basically all instances can
304:31 - support this container option and what
304:33 - it will do is it will install a
304:36 - container layer for you and then you can
304:39 - just specify your container image and
304:40 - it's very makes it very easy to launch
304:42 - containerized
304:45 - containerized services like single
304:47 - container services
304:48 - Azure doesn't do this AWS doesn't do
304:51 - this only gcp does this in this kind of
304:53 - convenient way so I really really like
304:55 - that not to say you can't do it on AWS
304:57 - you'd have to go to the marketplace but
304:58 - that is like a super bonus for me for
305:00 - gcp I notice there's some Advanced
305:03 - options here
305:04 - so like you know like the the command uh
305:07 - uh command arguments you probably
305:09 - specify uh environment variables maybe
305:11 - the entry point yeah that's the entry
305:13 - point there if you know anything about
305:14 - containers
305:15 - if you don't don't worry uh then you
305:17 - have your boot disk so this is the boot
305:20 - disk right and so we have some options
305:21 - here starts with 10 gigabytes I wouldn't
305:24 - want something larger than 10 GB but
305:25 - we'll take a look around here so here we
305:27 - could choose
305:29 - uh Debian or W9 we can change our
305:33 - operating system
305:35 - I'm pretty comfortable with Debbie and I
305:37 - I like Debian oh Fedora korres that's
305:39 - pretty cool
305:40 - I really like Fedora korres I just
305:42 - learned all about that recently
305:44 - you can provide your own custom images
305:47 - you can set the size of snapshot you can
305:49 - attach existing disks
305:52 - but we'll do stick with Debian because
305:53 - that's a pretty safe one there another
305:56 - one is pretty safe at Centos that's what
305:58 - a lot of the cloud service providers
306:00 - base there they're managed instances on
306:03 - but what we'll do is scroll on down you
306:05 - can see we can apply firewall stuff
306:09 - um
306:10 - yeah that's all fine we don't need to do
306:12 - any more without we don't need a
306:13 - firewall so we'll scroll up make sure
306:15 - our price is okay
306:16 - 7.83 you know what I'm looking for is
306:20 - um a lot of times cloud service
306:21 - providers will have a startup script
306:23 - here it is and this would be cloud and
306:26 - knit okay so Cloud init is a pretty
306:29 - standardized or CF internet cloud in it
306:31 - can't remember what it's called but it's
306:33 - a standardized way of uh providing your
306:36 - um your virtual machines with a script
306:39 - to start like it's the first thing it
306:41 - runs so if we wanted to install Apache
306:42 - we could do that
306:44 - um I'm just trying to see if there's
306:45 - like an example
306:48 - here
306:50 - like it's just a bash script right so
306:53 - I'm just thinking yeah see it here yeah
306:55 - this is actually exactly what I want too
306:56 - so this is perfect I didn't know they
306:58 - had this and so here the idea is that
307:00 - we'll just take this if you specify the
307:03 - first line in a cloud init file as this
307:06 - with the shebang it's going to know it's
307:08 - a basket but it can also take a yaml
307:10 - file I believe
307:12 - um but anyway what this will do is it
307:14 - will install it will do an update and
307:16 - then it will install Apache 2 and I
307:19 - believe these this is actually for
307:20 - Debian uh because if we were using
307:24 - um Centos it'd be like yum but apt is
307:28 - for that I don't know if it needs a
307:29 - pseudo in front of here it doesn't seem
307:30 - to need it but what we'll do is we'll
307:32 - put that in there save me a lot of time
307:34 - I didn't have to try to remember what to
307:35 - write
307:37 - um you can set custom metadata we don't
307:39 - need to set any custom metadata today
307:42 - and just looking some other stuff
307:44 - availability policy on host maintenance
307:46 - nope everything is fine so we'll go
307:48 - ahead and hit create and fingers crossed
307:50 - that just work
307:53 - uh I didn't set up any SSH though
307:56 - huh well if if there's options what
307:59 - we'll do is we'll just launch another
308:00 - one but we'll see how this one goes so
308:02 - what we'll have to do is wait a little
308:03 - while so I just hit refresh up here so
308:05 - there's the connect option for SSH but
308:07 - we're just waiting for it to start it's
308:09 - just going to spin so
308:10 - um let's give it five ten minutes and
308:12 - I'll see you back here in a moment okay
308:13 - okay so after waiting a little bit of
308:16 - time there I did have to hit the refresh
308:17 - button in order to see that green status
308:20 - but let's see if our website works so
308:22 - what we can do is go over to this
308:24 - external IP that is our public facing IP
308:26 - address hit that button to copy it and
308:28 - we'll go ahead and paste that on in
308:30 - there and so notice that it's not
308:31 - resolving if that's happening it's
308:34 - either means two things our Apache
308:36 - server is not running or our fire
308:38 - firewall rules is not allowing us to
308:41 - access on Port 80. so that is something
308:43 - we're going to need to figure out so we
308:45 - need to ssh in I'm so used to providing
308:47 - an SSH key or generating during the
308:50 - creation process I forgot the gcp
308:52 - doesn't make you a set one in the
308:54 - creation process you can just click here
308:56 - and it'll let you in so we can open
308:58 - browser in window on a custom port view
309:01 - gcloud command I kind of would prefer to
309:04 - do it in um
309:06 - the Google shell so let's just try the
309:09 - browser first okay
309:11 - and what it will do is we'll transfer
309:13 - the SSH keys to the VM so you don't have
309:15 - to do anything it's really easy to get
309:16 - in
309:18 - okay and we'll just give it a moment not
309:20 - fast but easy
309:22 - all right
309:24 - and we're in okay so we could type in LS
309:27 - PWD just to see where we are let's go to
309:30 - see the gcloud command if that doesn't
309:32 - work we'll just make our way back here
309:34 - but I would rather I would like to try
309:35 - to use the cloud shell because I think
309:38 - that's really nice we'll go view gcloud
309:39 - command and there it is so what we'll do
309:43 - I'm not sure if this is going to work
309:44 - but what we'll do is copy this the
309:47 - following can be used in the SSH into
309:50 - the instance okay so oh running Cloud
309:52 - shell perfect so if we didn't click
309:54 - there we could go up here and click
309:55 - activate Cloud shell
309:58 - Cloud shell is like a a terminal I think
310:00 - gcp was the first to have this Azure has
310:03 - one AWS now has one but gcp has the best
310:05 - experience for this but what we'll do is
310:07 - we'll go down here and say view in
310:09 - gcloud and just hit run in Cloud shell
310:13 - okay gcloud is the name of the um the
310:16 - CLI okay and we'll give it a moment to
310:20 - start up an instance here
310:24 - I assume it's containerized it's
310:25 - probably it's probably containers it's
310:27 - how so it's able to launch so fast
310:28 - usually it's super fast by the way it's
310:31 - not super fast today and it'll run that
310:33 - gcloud command it should get us into our
310:35 - instance
310:38 - also another cool thing about gcloud is
310:40 - it has a editor built in and it looks
310:42 - just like vs code I'm not going to
310:43 - switch over to it because I do not want
310:45 - to interrupt our terminal but if you
310:47 - want to do coding you can totally do it
310:48 - within the gcp platform and again that's
310:51 - a lot easier than the other ones make it
310:52 - out to be so it's pre-filled it in here
310:55 - it looks like this is a beta feature but
310:57 - we'll go ahead and hit enter
310:58 - uh it's requesting access we'll say
311:01 - authorized
311:03 - we will say yes
311:06 - we'll say enter enter so what it is is
311:10 - it generated out in SSH key for the
311:12 - cloud shell and then I imagine what it's
311:14 - going to do is then um take that SSH key
311:17 - move it on to the server and then allow
311:19 - us to then authenticate that way okay
311:23 - and so I believe
311:26 - yes we are in the instance because it
311:28 - says my website down below so I'll type
311:30 - in clear
311:31 - okay and so one way we could tell if
311:34 - it's working is we could uh
311:36 - we could do like a curl so if we did
311:38 - curl localhost
311:40 - and it returns HTML and it does that
311:42 - shows us that the Apache server is
311:45 - running probably could also type in sudo
311:47 - Apache
311:48 - um or maybe pseudo service
311:52 - um Apache to status
311:54 - yeah and it's running so so it's running
311:57 - and we we did a query so probably the
312:00 - issue has to do with the fact that our
312:03 - firewall's not open so let's go take a
312:05 - look there
312:06 - and see what we can do okay
312:09 - so we need to go create ourselves a
312:11 - firewall rule but I just remembered that
312:12 - we're going to need the IP address so
312:15 - I'm just clicking back to the instance
312:17 - here whenever this page loads I'm going
312:19 - to grab that external IP address and
312:21 - click back forward here we'll go ahead
312:23 - and create ourselves a new rule I'm just
312:25 - going to scroll on down and change this
312:27 - over
312:28 - to specify
312:31 - or all it's just all instances in the
312:34 - network and then specify the range and
312:36 - put forward slash
312:37 - 32 on the end there okay
312:40 - so the top here we're going to type in
312:41 - Port 80.
312:43 - and we'll maybe say website and we'll
312:46 - say I'll let
312:48 - our website
312:50 - be accessible
312:53 - on Port 80. probably would help to type
312:57 - correctly it's not going to hurt
312:58 - anything but you know someone else reads
313:00 - your stuff they want to make sure that
313:02 - it reads okay logs will leave that off
313:04 - default network is fine priority is fine
313:07 - Ingress means inbound egress means
313:09 - outbounds we want to get in like to get
313:13 - something back right we can allow or
313:15 - deny so we are allowing if we scroll on
313:18 - down below we can specify the ports this
313:20 - is TCP we're going to put Port 80
313:23 - and then we'll go down below and go
313:26 - ahead and hit create
313:28 - does not like the name must be lowercase
313:32 - it's hard to remember all these rules
313:34 - we'll go ahead and hit create
313:45 - we'll give it a moment
313:48 - and what we'll do is go back to the
313:50 - internet hit enter
313:52 - and see
313:54 - if this is working
313:57 - doesn't seem to be working just yet
313:58 - let's give this a refresh see if our
314:00 - rule appears here so Port 80 that is
314:04 - correct priority so it has a high
314:05 - priority so it should be applied 32 203
314:09 - 103 forward slash 32 the 32 just means
314:12 - exactly that IP address we'll go up here
314:14 - it did not resolve so just give me a
314:16 - moment I'll take a think about this okay
314:18 - so I think we might have an easier way
314:20 - to uh make firewall rules in the way we
314:22 - were doing it here so what I'm going to
314:24 - do is go back to my instance here
314:25 - because I could have swore that it was
314:27 - here but I probably just forgot if we go
314:29 - down to view Network details I think
314:31 - here uh we'll get yeah so there is we
314:35 - don't have any network tags so we don't
314:36 - have any way to specify tag but here we
314:40 - have the external IP and the internal IP
314:42 - address and what I wanted to see was
314:43 - what firewall rules were being applied
314:45 - so here if we go over here we can see
314:49 - that we have Port 80 so this should be
314:52 - applying
314:55 - um and down below we could probably do a
314:58 - connect connectivity test here
315:03 - and we'll see what we get back
315:08 - okay we'll go ahead and create a
315:09 - connectivity test let's say uh Port 80
315:13 - or Port 80 test
315:15 - TCP sounds good to me
315:19 - and we want this to hit the 35.203.103.0
315:28 - and that's the IP address we could also
315:31 - just say the VM instance that's a lot
315:32 - easier I like that instead notice it's
315:34 - hitting the primary internal IP so
315:37 - that's not going to be very useful
315:38 - because we have to go from the outside
315:39 - in okay so we'll do 35.203.103.0
315:45 - this is IP address used in gcp this is
315:48 - an IP address used in gcp when you yes
315:51 - it is okay
315:53 - um and that's correct so we'll do Port
315:54 - 80 and we'll say create
315:57 - and we'll see if we get some
315:59 - connectivity so it's just a way for us
316:02 - to effectively see if it's working
316:06 - um
316:07 - last time test last package transmission
316:09 - result so it's probably running it I'll
316:13 - just go here and hit rerun
316:18 - yeah that's fine
316:21 - and do I have a refresh button here new
316:24 - I don't and so it says it's reachable
316:28 - okay
316:29 - well it could go ahead and view the
316:30 - results so we have the VM instance the
316:33 - Ingress egress firewall rules the static
316:36 - route Nat Nat VM instance so everything
316:38 - seems to be working so maybe I'm crazy
316:41 - maybe our thing is working let's go back
316:43 - and take a look again
316:47 - okay
316:49 - but it's not working another thing we
316:51 - could do is we could open up our Cloud
316:52 - shell
316:55 - and so we were using Cloud shell within
316:57 - the server let's just make sure we're
316:58 - not on the inside we're not that's good
316:59 - and what we can do is just do a curl and
317:02 - paste in that IP address and see if we
317:03 - get anything returned back
317:05 - if it times out that means that it's not
317:08 - going to work
317:09 - and notice it's not it's timing out so
317:10 - we still have a firewall rule issue here
317:13 - so let me just try a bit more but hey we
317:15 - did learn
317:16 - we did learn about uh cognitivity tests
317:19 - so it's kind of nice so we'll be back in
317:20 - a moment here okay
317:22 - okay so I think I know what the problem
317:23 - is I haven't tried it yet but I was just
317:25 - staring at this thinking okay I put the
317:27 - IP address in why is it not working well
317:29 - the problem I think is is the fact that
317:31 - I provided the IP address uh for the VM
317:34 - instance but we're actually trying to
317:35 - say what is allowed in right so it
317:37 - really should be my IP address or a
317:41 - public-facing internet so what I'll do
317:43 - is I'm just going to say what's my IP
317:46 - okay
317:49 - and we'll grab this here
317:51 - I bet that's the problem because we're
317:53 - not trying to allow the own server the
317:55 - own IP address of the server
317:56 - into itself that makes no sense it would
317:59 - make more sense if it was ours so what
318:00 - I'll do is go ahead and click this we'll
318:02 - go ahead and edit this Rule and we'll
318:04 - scroll on down and we'll switch this out
318:06 - for my IP address now you could do
318:10 - 0.0.0.04.0 and that's what you'd want to
318:12 - do if you're launching a real website
318:13 - here we'll go ahead and save it
318:16 - how embarrassing
318:19 - but uh it just goes to show it doesn't
318:21 - matter how many years you work with
318:23 - Cloud it's easy to get turned around
318:24 - okay so we'll go up here hit enter and
318:27 - now our website loads so there you go
318:29 - it's not that hard
318:31 - um as long as you know what you're doing
318:32 - okay so what we'll do is we'll make our
318:34 - way back
318:36 - uh to our instance so we'll say compute
318:39 - engine up here
318:43 - probably could pin it um I don't really
318:45 - I don't really like pinning things but
318:46 - so that was our instance
318:49 - um is there anything else of interest to
318:51 - show here not really so let's go ahead
318:53 - and just delete this instance okay
318:57 - and we'll hit refresh here
319:01 - okay it's going to delete I'm pretty
319:03 - confident about it I'm not too concerned
319:04 - about this resource and so what we'll do
319:06 - is go back and click on gcp or Google
319:08 - Cloud platform and uh we'll move on to
319:11 - the next follow along okay
319:12 - [Music]
319:17 - all right so we learned about compute
319:18 - engine let's go learn about I don't know
319:21 - let's say uh databases so what we'll do
319:23 - on the left hand side here is scroll on
319:25 - down and let's go take a look for
319:30 - um
319:31 - SQL so there's spanner and there's
319:33 - Esquibel so spanner uh it's a relational
319:37 - like it's its own variant of a
319:39 - relational database but it's not it's
319:41 - neither postgres or uh MySQL but if you
319:44 - were to be launching a web applications
319:46 - you'd probably want to just use the SQL
319:48 - service so we'll go here and we'll
319:50 - launch ourselves our own SQL instance so
319:52 - go ahead here and create an instance we
319:54 - have the option between MySQL postgres
319:56 - and SQL Server I am particular to
319:59 - postgres so I'll go ahead and click this
320:04 - and we'll go up here and so lowercase
320:07 - numbers letters so my relational
320:10 - database or my uh postgres
320:14 - and we'll need a password so we'll go
320:16 - ahead and generate one there we'll show
320:17 - the password just so I don't have to
320:19 - figure that out later and I need to dump
320:22 - that somewhere
320:24 - so
320:26 - I'm just pasting it off screen so just
320:28 - make sure you know where your password
320:30 - is uh postgres13 seems fine to me I like
320:34 - to launch things in Canada so let's go
320:36 - look for Canada there's Montreal
320:40 - we have single zone and multi-zone now
320:42 - notice does it show us the cost here
320:44 - it's not but I can tell you if you have
320:47 - it in multiple zones it should cost more
320:49 - because you're running redundant servers
320:51 - so I'm going to go single zone
320:53 - okay I want it to be cost effective all
320:56 - right we could even specify the zones
320:58 - I'm going to say any I don't care where
320:59 - it's going to go we can customize our
321:01 - configuration options so let's open it
321:03 - up because we want again the lowest cost
321:05 - for our example here
321:08 - um so we got high memory standards
321:10 - shared core shared core sounds cheap
321:12 - we have lightweight I'm just checking
321:14 - the values here over on the left hand
321:16 - side so look at high memory 26
321:19 - 26 gigabytes that's insane like I don't
321:22 - have a gaming computer that much we go
321:23 - over here now we're down to three seven
321:25 - uh seven gigabytes that's lightweight
321:28 - nothing I don't see anything changing
321:30 - there but I imagine it's cheaper that we
321:32 - have a shared core 600 megabytes this
321:34 - has to be cheap all right so this is the
321:37 - one we're going to choose for storage
321:40 - SSD is fine
321:43 - we don't we're not really doing anything
321:44 - real so I'm going to choose HDD that
321:47 - should be cheaper right I'm going to go
321:48 - 10 gigabytes because I'm not doing
321:50 - anything real enable automatic storage
321:52 - increase that's something you'd want to
321:54 - have but for our purposes I'm turning
321:56 - that off
321:58 - um do we want to have a public IP
322:00 - address well I do because I want to
322:01 - connect to it maybe do a query on it so
322:03 - we'll leave that there you might want to
322:05 - turn that off if you're running a secure
322:07 - workload generally you would and you
322:09 - just only allow
322:10 - um
322:11 - access through uh you know the um
322:15 - firewalls and stuff like that I do not
322:17 - need backups today
322:18 - we don't care when the maintenance
322:20 - Windows is flags are fine we don't need
322:23 - insights insights are nice if you want
322:24 - to query and see information I don't
322:27 - think this costs extra I'm going to
322:29 - leave it off anyway we don't need it
322:30 - today we can set labels as per usual so
322:32 - I can say EnV
322:35 - uh Dev should have been Dev last time
322:37 - too and so I'll go ahead and create this
322:40 - instance
322:44 - okay
322:45 - now I didn't specify
322:48 - a database name so maybe it's just the
322:50 - the identifier all right so I'll just
322:52 - wait for this to provision and I'll see
322:54 - you back here in a moment okay
322:55 - all right so after waiting a little
322:57 - while there it looks like our instance
322:59 - is ready it took about
323:01 - um I don't know 10 minutes for that to
323:02 - spin up uh not too bad and so down below
323:05 - we have the public IP address the
323:07 - outgoing IP address the connection name
323:10 - but looks like there's an easy way to
323:11 - connect with the cloud shells let's
323:13 - click and see if it auto fills it in for
323:15 - us that'd be really really nice
323:17 - I'm not sure if that's the case but I
323:19 - guess we'll find out here in a moment
323:20 - right
323:21 - looks like it is so it says gcloud SQL
323:24 - connect my postgres
323:26 - puts in the username which is postgres
323:30 - um so it looks good let's go ahead ahead
323:32 - and hit enter
323:34 - I might have entered that in twice there
323:36 - permission to deny Cloud SQL admin API
323:39 - has not been used in this project before
323:40 - or is disabled enable it by visiting
323:43 - this link so I guess that's what we'll
323:45 - have to go ahead and do so we'll go and
323:47 - click that link there
323:52 - and we'll give it a moment
323:56 - say enable
324:04 - usually this doesn't take too long
324:06 - sometimes you can tell by going up to
324:07 - the top so that's good so what we'll do
324:09 - is go back and hit up we'll hit enter
324:11 - and see if it connects now
324:14 - along your IP address for incoming
324:16 - connection for five minutes sounds cool
324:19 - can I do stuff I will say backslash D oh
324:24 - no we're waiting okay
324:27 - well not sure what's going on there
324:29 - that's not too clear but I mean that's
324:31 - not usually High we connect to a
324:33 - postgres instance what I would do is
324:35 - collect the names and use something like
324:37 - table plus and that's what I want to do
324:38 - here so that's what we're going to do
324:40 - okay
324:41 - all right so what I got here is uh table
324:44 - plus and this is just a way of
324:45 - connecting to postgres instances so go
324:47 - ahead and make a new connection to
324:49 - postgres this is free software by the
324:51 - way you can go and download it works on
324:53 - Windows Mac and Etc and so we got to
324:55 - fill in a bunch of these things so uh we
324:58 - need the host we need the username and
325:01 - the password so the username is postgres
325:05 - okay the password I saved earlier so I'm
325:10 - going to bring that on over here and
325:11 - paste that in
325:13 - um
325:14 - the database name would be what
325:19 - um it could be
325:21 - this is connection name but that's not
325:23 - very useful
325:25 - I mean my postgres is probably because
325:27 - this looks like it's this is probably
325:29 - the name of the database that's probably
325:31 - the um
325:33 - database name there is my postgres
325:37 - what would the host be
325:40 - uh usually like if it's AWS they have a
325:43 - connection URL I suppose you could use
325:44 - an IP address I'm just not used to
325:46 - having that so we have a public IP
325:47 - address and an outgoing IP address let's
325:50 - try the public IP address here 35 203 16
325:54 - 181
325:57 - we'll say gcp my postgres here
326:00 - and so it looks like we have mostly
326:02 - everything the default Port is 5432 so
326:05 - we'll just do 5432
326:07 - we'll hit test and see if that works
326:09 - fingers crossed
326:13 - okay so what I'm waiting for is this to
326:15 - go green
326:17 - it might not go green
326:19 - um
326:21 - let's just try connect instead
326:24 - on Mac it goes green you'll say hey
326:26 - you're connected
326:28 - and it did not connect okay so that's
326:31 - fine so what we'll do is we'll give it a
326:33 - little bit of check here so
326:36 - what else would we need to do okay maybe
326:39 - back I'll be back here in a moment okay
326:41 - you know something I was just thinking
326:43 - is
326:43 - um you know it looks like all our
326:45 - configuration settings are correct but
326:46 - maybe our firewall is just not open so
326:48 - what I'm going to do is make a new tab
326:50 - here and we'll give it a go
326:51 - it's all about trying things on the Fly
326:53 - here nothing's too hard for the cloud
326:56 - uh and we'll go firewall I just want
326:58 - firewall rules well that's app engine so
327:00 - we'll go here because I imagine this
327:02 - must be in a VPC so what we'll do is go
327:06 - here and create ourselves a new rule
327:08 - and I will say uh my postgres rule
327:15 - and we'll go down we'll let Ingress
327:17 - allow specify targets we're just going
327:20 - to
327:21 - do all instances in the networks with a
327:24 - particular IP range so
327:27 - um I'm just going to get my IP IP
327:29 - address like I did last time so my IP
327:31 - address right
327:37 - and we'll grab it there
327:41 - we'll drop it in four slash 32
327:44 - we'll say TCP 5432 we'll go ahead and
327:48 - create that rule
327:49 - so now now that I have this rule on 5432
327:53 - which is the port 4 postgres let's go
327:55 - ahead well I guess we got to wait we
327:57 - should probably be patient there is the
327:58 - rule I'm going to go ahead and hit test
328:01 - see if it works now probably it's not
328:03 - going to work if I have that colon in
328:04 - the name in the database
328:07 - we'll try again just connect here
328:15 - that doesn't work we'll just edit it
328:17 - again
328:18 - test connection
328:23 - is the server running 5432 still no good
328:25 - okay well I'll give it another try okay
328:28 - give me a second
328:29 - okay so another thought I had was I was
328:31 - just poking around and we have users and
328:33 - databases here on the left hand side so
328:34 - here we have postgres and then here we
328:37 - have uh postgres again so there is no
328:40 - database called
328:42 - I mean again I haven't tried it but
328:44 - there is no database
328:47 - called my postgres database that's just
328:50 - what I wrote in because I assumed it's
328:52 - based on the instant stand it's just the
328:53 - name of the instance internally for gcp
328:56 - so what would happen if I was to type in
328:58 - postgres instead here and then test this
329:00 - connection would this work because to me
329:03 - like this would make a lot more sense
329:04 - right
329:06 - uh and if that doesn't work I would say
329:09 - that we have the database right and the
329:11 - username is right but maybe there's
329:13 - something wrong with the host or the IP
329:14 - address or the connection so we go over
329:16 - to users that looks fine we go to the
329:19 - databases this one's called postgres so
329:21 - that is fine we go to connections
329:25 - um
329:27 - and it's public IP to authorize a
329:29 - network or use cloud SQL so we said
329:31 - public IP address is fine you do not
329:34 - have an authorized any external networks
329:36 - to connect to your Cloud SQL external
329:38 - applications you can still connect
329:39 - through Cloud proxy so if we don't have
329:41 - a network maybe that's our problem
329:44 - so oops
329:46 - what if I go and grab my IP address here
329:49 - maybe that's our problem
329:51 - forward slash 32 my home address
329:55 - we'll hit done
329:58 - uh we'll hit save
330:01 - scroll on down below here uh here it
330:04 - says you can manage if you're encrypted
330:06 - public IP address only allow unsecured
330:08 - connections are allowed to connect and
330:10 - that's fine we just want to be able to
330:11 - use it so what we'll do is go back here
330:14 - try this again we'll hit test
330:17 - and this thing is super buggy but notice
330:20 - that it's editing our postgres so I'll
330:21 - see you back here in a moment okay
330:25 - okay so we waited a short amount of time
330:28 - and what I'm going to do is go edit and
330:30 - notice my connection is postgres
330:31 - postgres the database password I put in
330:33 - the hostname and if I go ahead and hit
330:36 - connect it now connects so I don't think
330:39 - that firewall rule mattered at all
330:40 - that's for VM instances uh so I probably
330:43 - go back and just delete it out just to
330:45 - make sure you know that is the case so
330:47 - we just type in firewall here
330:50 - okay
330:52 - and I'm going to go ahead and delete
330:55 - this rule
330:57 - all right
331:00 - and now just to do a sanity check
331:04 - it's not uncommon for cloud service
331:06 - providers to have you know that stuff
331:08 - message separately like in AWS you have
331:10 - uh security groups that are like DB
331:13 - security groups that are specialized so
331:14 - to me that's not a surprise that was
331:16 - like that we'll get go ahead and hit
331:18 - edit hit connect can we still connect
331:20 - yes okay so that's how we had to grant
331:22 - us access now this is postgres this is
331:25 - the default table you really wouldn't be
331:26 - uh making uh or or database you wouldn't
331:29 - be making stuff inside of that what
331:31 - you'd probably want to do is go ahead
331:32 - and create a new database so what we can
331:34 - do go back to our instance here
331:37 - close some tabs out so we don't get
331:39 - confused and probably what we'd have to
331:41 - do is create a new database in here so
331:43 - we go here and I'd say
331:45 - um uh you know my database okay we'll
331:48 - hit create
331:52 - and we'll give that a moment to create
331:54 - probably the postgres user is a super
331:57 - user so we can do whatever we want there
331:59 - but if we go and enter a connection
332:00 - we're going to leave out the database it
332:02 - should allow us to connect to all of the
332:04 - databases here
332:06 - so it should show us postgres and the
332:07 - other one
332:10 - we might have to select our database so
332:12 - control K or
332:14 - oops that's not it Ctrl K okay so there
332:17 - we go so we can see we have Cloud SQL
332:20 - admin my database and postgres so I'll
332:23 - go ahead and click into postgres here
332:27 - all right and there are no tables but I
332:29 - can go and maybe I can make a new table
332:31 - here yep so there we go so we say ID
332:34 - and I will add a new column it will say
332:37 - name
332:39 - we'll make that a varchar let me just
332:42 - drop down change it to far char
332:44 - or text I just prefer text okay
332:47 - and we'll go ahead and save that create
332:49 - Untitled table oh we got to name the
332:50 - table so it's a users here
332:54 - and now what it does not like here zero
332:58 - length identifier create table undefined
333:00 - table well I just named it up here the
333:02 - primary ID would be ID up here
333:06 - can I save it now
333:07 - maybe it doesn't like this one hold on
333:09 - here
333:11 - I'm doing Ctrl s by the way to save it
333:13 - um
333:14 - I never create tables this way I always
333:16 - go through and make a manual connection
333:19 - um but I'm giving it a go here today for
333:21 - the first time so zero length eliminated
333:23 - identified at or near
333:26 - double quotations
333:29 - want to be named over here maybe
333:34 - I mean it's named right I don't know it
333:36 - doesn't doesn't want it
333:38 - um
333:39 - you know if that doesn't work that's
333:41 - totally fine the other way we could do
333:43 - this is
333:45 - um
333:46 - I'm just thinking here because if we
333:49 - like I don't have
333:51 - um
333:51 - postgres client installed on my local
333:53 - machine I don't think I do
333:55 - so I don't think I can use that I can
333:57 - try let's see here
333:59 - no I don't think I do so uh the only way
334:02 - I'd have to do that is probably through
334:03 - Cloud shell and through Cloud shell we
334:04 - would have to allow the IP address I
334:07 - don't know how much of a pain that is my
334:09 - point is is that you know like it's not
334:11 - necessary for the exam to know how to
334:12 - set up a table but the idea is to
334:14 - establish a connection I just wanted to
334:15 - show you how to do that and so I kind of
334:18 - feel like we've kind of satisfied it
334:19 - there and solved all the stuff that we
334:21 - wanted to do but what we'll do is we'll
334:23 - just go ahead and destroy this and we're
334:25 - all good to go okay
334:30 - and what we'll do is just check box that
334:32 - off or click into there
334:34 - we'll go ahead and hit delete
334:37 - and we will put in the instance name
334:39 - there we go
334:42 - and it's deleting I'm pretty confident
334:43 - that will delete and that's it there so
334:47 - we're done with that we'll move on to
334:48 - the next
334:49 - [Music]
334:53 - hey it's Andrew Brown from exam Pro and
334:55 - in this follow along I want to show you
334:56 - Google's app engine which allows you to
334:59 - easily deploy uh web applications so in
335:02 - the top left corner we'll go all the way
335:04 - up here to the navigation menu and we'll
335:06 - scroll on down looking for app engine
335:08 - which appears under serverless
335:10 - so we'll go there
335:12 - we'll go ahead and create ourselves a
335:13 - new application and the first thing
335:15 - we're going to see is a bunch of regions
335:17 - we can choose from I like to always
335:19 - choose from Canada so what I'll do is
335:22 - try to find my region if it is available
335:24 - might not be which is totally fine
335:27 - um and I don't think I'm going to get
335:29 - Canada today
335:31 - so I'll just go with us East one
335:34 - so let's zoom in on this map here oh no
335:37 - there's Canada there we go
335:38 - North America Northeast one grape so
335:41 - we'll go next
335:43 - and we'll give it a moment to load it's
335:45 - just thinking really hard there
335:54 - thinking really hard
336:07 - and I cannot tell if it's frozen so what
336:10 - I'm going to do is just give it a hard
336:11 - refresh here see if that helps at all
336:15 - all right so I just had to give it a
336:17 - hard refresh there uh in order for this
336:19 - to actually show up but what I want you
336:22 - to do is go down and we'll choose our
336:24 - runtime to be a ruby because that's what
336:25 - I know and love uh and we have the
336:28 - option between uh standard and flexible
336:30 - for the exam you definitely want to know
336:31 - the difference uh for this follow along
336:33 - not a big deal we're going to stick with
336:35 - standard here today and the great thing
336:37 - is they do have some samples here on
336:39 - GitHub so what I'm going to do is right
336:41 - click here and just take a look here at
336:43 - what they have and they've got a bunch
336:45 - of different stuff here uh and so what
336:48 - I'm thinking is we can open up our Cloud
336:50 - shell so I'm going to open up Cloud
336:52 - shell here at the top
336:54 - and it actually has an editor mode I
336:56 - haven't really given this a go so let's
336:57 - try it out I know what it looks like
336:59 - it's like vs code
337:01 - um but I'm just saying I haven't done a
337:02 - big workload in here yet so I'm kind of
337:04 - curious and we'll let that load up and
337:07 - oh yeah there's me doing some bigquery
337:09 - stuff from earlier but what I'm going to
337:12 - do yeah see I'm just doing a quick test
337:14 - there but what I'm going to do here is
337:16 - bring in a new repo so here
337:19 - um Source control I don't really use vs
337:22 - code but usually you can go here and
337:25 - press this button here
337:28 - uh
337:30 - um and that's not really helping so
337:32 - that's fine we'll open up the terminal
337:35 - it's not a big deal and I'm just going
337:37 - to do LS PWD to see where I am so I'm in
337:39 - my home directory and here it's going to
337:42 - ask me to do it get clone so I should be
337:44 - able to clone this and we'll hit enter
337:46 - and so now we have all those samples so
337:49 - the question is and here down below it
337:51 - says app engine forward slash app engine
337:52 - whatever what I noticed is that there is
337:54 - no folder called app engine so which one
337:56 - will be run well intuitively I would
337:59 - pick something like rails or maybe
338:00 - Sinatra so maybe they have a very simple
338:03 - example they also have static files so
338:06 - they have Sinatra and rails but um
338:09 - they have a Hello World example here and
338:12 - if we click into it it is Sinatra so I
338:14 - feel that this will probably be the
338:16 - easiest way to deploy and then we have
338:18 - our app yaml file that's actually how we
338:20 - configure
338:21 - um most like like whether it's app
338:24 - engine elastic Beanstalk or app uh Azure
338:28 - app Services there was some cap like
338:30 - this accompanying a configuration file
338:32 - that you can use with it I'm noticing
338:33 - that this is set to flex so maybe we
338:38 - might want to use flex mode and to me it
338:41 - doesn't really matter whether it's
338:42 - standard or flexible so maybe we'll just
338:44 - switch it over to flexible here
338:46 - um and what I'll do oops
338:51 - is it says initialize deploy so what
338:54 - I'll do is I'll just see into that hello
338:56 - world directory here
339:01 - oh we got a first CD into our Ruby docs
339:03 - and then into our hello world directory
339:06 - oh look at that now there is a uh
339:09 - there's an app engine right here maybe
339:11 - we're already in that folder okay that's
339:13 - why so we'll do app engine
339:15 - and then we'll do hello world okay
339:18 - and so
339:20 - we'll probably have to do a bundle
339:22 - install so just do a bundle install
339:26 - uh
339:26 - [Music]
339:28 - uh gem file cannot be required you have
339:31 - Etc
339:32 - it could be just because this machine
339:34 - doesn't have
339:35 - um a ruby installed so maybe we'll do
339:38 - um gem install bundler actually I didn't
339:41 - even check if this has Ruby does this
339:42 - have Ruby installed
339:43 - yeah it does okay and actually it's a
339:45 - very recent version so we'll do gem
339:47 - install bundler
339:49 - it's really not even necessary to do
339:51 - this but it's just out of habit I like
339:53 - to make sure that it uh it bundles
339:55 - before deploying
339:56 - bundler is just like requirements.txt or
339:59 - npm it's just Ruby's package manager or
340:03 - a composer if you're used to using PHP
340:06 - and so then I can just do a bundle
340:07 - install after install the packages
340:12 - did I not just install bundler gym
340:14 - install bundler yep it's installed
340:17 - bundle install
340:20 - [Music]
340:21 - um
340:22 - I'm I'm not really that worried about
340:24 - getting it running locally I just want
340:25 - to deploy it and so in order to deploy
340:28 - it we will have to run the G Cloud app
340:31 - deploy command we'll just double check
340:34 - and make sure that's the case here I'm
340:35 - pretty sure that's what it says down
340:36 - below yeah it's just as simple as this
340:39 - so hopefully this works no problem
340:45 - and we'll authorize it with gcloud if
340:47 - you're installing this locally you
340:48 - probably use gcloud.net to authenticate
340:51 - it's giving us some details here it's
340:53 - really hard to read this on white on
340:55 - black or black on white there but uh
340:58 - let's see what it's doing so
341:00 - we have a description it's going to tell
341:02 - us a source it's going to show us the
341:03 - target URL where it's going to deploy
341:05 - app engine uh default service account
341:08 - sounds good to me so we'll hit y for yes
341:11 - and we'll let it go ahead and provision
341:19 - probably the most simple out of all the
341:22 - providers in terms of like a platform as
341:24 - a service I would say gcp is out of all
341:27 - the three
341:34 - great and so if you just take a look
341:35 - there you can tell it's actually
341:37 - building out a containerized image so it
341:39 - gives you the idea that this is running
341:41 - off of containers
341:46 - also noticing that it's setting up Cloud
341:48 - SQL
341:49 - and cloud cloud SQL proxy so I would
341:52 - suppose if it needed to be backed by a
341:54 - database
341:56 - um this should be shouldn't require a
341:58 - database we'll just take a look here
341:59 - maybe the configuration it has that in
342:02 - there nope just says environments Flex
342:04 - runtime Ruby
342:06 - resources memory disk size Etc so I'm
342:09 - not I'm not sure why it's spinning up a
342:12 - relational database there but and this
342:15 - doesn't even have one but maybe that's
342:16 - just part of what it does okay
342:19 - so we'll just have to wait here a little
342:21 - bit a while and I'll see you back here
342:23 - in a moment okay
342:29 - all right and so after a little while
342:30 - there we can see there's a cloud build
342:32 - fail
342:34 - um it doesn't say as to why hold on here
342:40 - um you have out of gem Etc I know Ruby
342:42 - pretty well so for me uh it's not hard
342:45 - to figure out as to why but looks like
342:47 - we're gonna have to go check the log so
342:49 - I'm not sure what the logs are so just
342:51 - give me a moment I'll go figure that out
342:52 - okay
342:53 - all right so what I did here is I went
342:55 - down below and I opened up this link uh
342:58 - which brings us to our build details and
343:00 - if we scroll all the way down to the
343:02 - bottom notice how many steps it's out of
343:03 - 11 out of 14. so this is actually
343:05 - building the container image and when it
343:07 - went and uh and did a bundle install uh
343:10 - it ran into some trouble here so you're
343:12 - trying to install in deployment mode
343:13 - after changing your gem file run bundle
343:15 - install elsewhere and add the updated
343:17 - gem lock gem file.lock to the version
343:21 - control so
343:24 - um I think maybe we just have to get
343:25 - that bundle installed to work so what
343:27 - I'll do is go back here to my editor I
343:30 - really wish I could figure out how to
343:31 - change the theme Here Is there a way we
343:34 - can change the theme so I can see what
343:36 - I'm looking at
343:39 - I'm not sure maybe settings
343:42 - uh color theme
343:44 - and we will go Abyss oh there we go
343:48 - that's a little bit better so we'll work
343:50 - with that I suppose
343:52 - um so maybe we just need to make sure
343:53 - that the bundle install Works uh which
343:55 - is something I try to just get around
343:57 - but there's no gem lock file that's what
343:59 - it's probably going to be complaining
344:00 - about so if I just expand this here yeah
344:02 - notice there's no gem gem gemfall.lock
344:05 - or gem lock file so we'll do a bundle
344:08 - install and this time will just be a bit
344:09 - more thorough about its read so could
344:12 - not find bundler required by your home
344:14 - directory to update the latest version
344:16 - installed in your system do bundle
344:17 - update bundler so we'll do bundle update
344:19 - bundler
344:20 - let's see if that works I would have
344:22 - thought that we were up to the latest
344:23 - version because we ran it the lock file
344:26 - is being updated to bundler 2 after
344:27 - which you'll be unable to return to
344:29 - bundler one totally fine with that
344:31 - nobody uses bundler one anymore but if
344:33 - we take a look here on the left hand
344:35 - side I don't see
344:37 - um bundler gen lock file there so I'll
344:39 - do bundle install and so now I should
344:41 - have one you have to hit refresh here
344:45 - um so let's see one here let's do a
344:47 - clear and I'll do a LS hyphen la
344:50 - yeah it's right there so
344:53 - uh oh you know why it's because I'm not
344:55 - looking in the subfolder here so we're
344:57 - supposed to go app engine hello world
344:59 - and so there's that gem lock file so now
345:01 - let's go ahead and try that to play
345:02 - again I don't know what happens when you
345:04 - have a failed deploy like that so we'll
345:05 - just hit enter uh and I wonder if
345:07 - anything has changed here with app
345:10 - engine probably not probably a
345:13 - successful deploy while that's going
345:14 - let's go take a look here what was going
345:16 - on
345:17 - um through our build history so
345:20 - uh nothing exciting here but I wanted to
345:22 - see what services was so it was doing it
345:24 - through Cloud build so Cloud build
345:26 - um I imagine it's just like um
345:29 - uh AWS code build which is just a build
345:32 - server so it's a server that is designed
345:33 - to build things
345:35 - um and so that could be preparing uh
345:38 - artifacts for code or in this case it
345:40 - could be building out a image which I
345:42 - think that's what it was doing was
345:43 - building out an image so that's
345:45 - interesting how they uh they link that
345:47 - up so we'll go ahead and hit capital Y
345:49 - here and we'll let it go and deploy
345:51 - again and I will see you here at the end
345:55 - of it and hopefully it works or you know
345:57 - we'll encounter a new error okay
345:59 - all right so after waiting several
346:01 - minutes here uh it looks like it is done
346:03 - uh and it has a science command here
346:06 - called gcloud app browse I don't know if
346:08 - it's going to work within the
346:10 - um Google Cloud shell here let's give it
346:13 - a go and see what happens
346:17 - okay so it didn't detect a browser
346:18 - because we're not running it on our
346:20 - local machine we're running it within uh
346:22 - the Google shell but that's fine we can
346:24 - just copy that link and paste it up on
346:26 - here
346:27 - and so we can see the application is
346:29 - working so let's go give it a peek uh in
346:31 - the actual service let's see what we can
346:34 - see okay
346:35 - because usually usually we will see some
346:38 - additional stuff here so I'll go give
346:40 - this a hard refresh here
346:42 - uh I'm still showing us uh that we'll go
346:45 - ahead and click the dashboard here and
346:47 - so
346:48 - our app should be here
346:52 - uh looks like it must be running here
346:55 - um I'm just trying to distinguish okay
346:56 - up in the top right corner that's where
346:58 - we can see it we can see our versioning
346:59 - here
347:00 - we've got Services okay that makes sense
347:04 - if we wanted to upload uh different
347:06 - versions or we deploy new versions I
347:09 - guess would be version management
347:11 - so yeah pretty straightforward so I'd
347:13 - say we're all done here and now we just
347:16 - need to go ahead and tear this down
347:20 - um good question so I I mean I see this
347:23 - running here so I imagine we can just go
347:24 - ahead and delete it oops
347:29 - I have no idea how we should delete this
347:31 - so just give me a second and I'll figure
347:32 - this out okay
347:34 - all right so it looks like we don't
347:35 - delete app engines we just disable them
347:38 - uh so let's go ahead here and click on
347:41 - disable and we will enter this key in
347:45 - here
347:46 - okay
347:48 - and so that should disable it so why
347:51 - they don't let you delete them I do not
347:52 - know why
347:54 - um but I mean that's totally fine as
347:55 - long as we're not getting build so here
347:57 - it says your app has been currently
347:59 - disabled okay
348:01 - um so yeah there we go
348:03 - so we'll just make our way back here and
348:04 - move on to the next service
348:07 - [Music]
348:12 - this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and
348:13 - let's go take a look at some storage
348:15 - options for gcp in specific
348:18 - um cloud storage so what we'll do is
348:20 - scroll on down here so we got our
348:21 - compute and we have our storage and here
348:23 - is cloud storage
348:26 - okay
348:27 - and you will notice
348:29 - our screen's a bit messed up here just
348:31 - give it a whoops give it a hard refresh
348:34 - here to get that weird navigation out of
348:36 - the way but you can see that because we
348:39 - set up our app engine we already have
348:41 - some storage here but let's go ahead and
348:44 - create ourselves a new bucket
348:46 - and we'll just say uh my new bucket
348:50 - okay these are globally unique names so
348:53 - it's just like domain name so you might
348:55 - have to put in some random numbers there
348:57 - click continue now we have an option of
348:59 - multi-region dual region or just region
349:02 - with the lowest latency with a single
349:04 - region
349:05 - um I'm just going to stick with
349:06 - multi-region for this I'm going to see
349:09 - if I can choose Canada I actually only
349:11 - have three options U.S European union or
349:13 - Asia if I choose different ones what are
349:16 - my options do I get North America there
349:18 - we go so actually I want Toronto because
349:20 - that's the closest place that I am here
349:22 - uh clearly multi-region would give you
349:24 - the highest availability but if you want
349:26 - the lowest latency and you just want a
349:27 - single region more options you probably
349:29 - might just want to choose a region there
349:30 - okay we'll go ahead and hit continue I
349:33 - like on the right hand side it's
349:34 - estimating our cost here now we have our
349:37 - different storage options this will
349:38 - absolutely show up on the exam so you
349:40 - need to know the difference so standard
349:42 - best for short-term storage and
349:43 - frequently accessed data near line best
349:45 - for backup and data access less than a
349:47 - month cold line best for disaster
349:49 - recovery and data access less than once
349:51 - a quarter archive best for long-term
349:53 - digital preservation of data access
349:55 - lesson once a year so we're going to
349:56 - stick with standard uh and then here it
349:59 - says prevent Public Access one of the
350:01 - most
350:02 - um uh common vulnerabilities for cloud
350:05 - service providers is through cloud
350:08 - storage when they're made public
350:09 - especially on AWS I'm sure it's no
350:11 - different for gcp so it's probably good
350:14 - to have a public access prevention
350:15 - turned on on the bucket and then you
350:17 - have access controls under it you have
350:19 - uniform and fine grade we're not sharing
350:22 - this with anybody else so we don't have
350:24 - to worry about that we'll go ahead and
350:25 - hit continue you'll notice that we can
350:27 - set encryption to be the Google manage
350:29 - encryption key or a customer manage
350:31 - encryption key we'll just stick with
350:33 - Google's manage key there because that's
350:35 - very easy you can set up a retention
350:37 - policy if we check boxes we get more
350:39 - information so we could say how long we
350:41 - want to retain uh stuff for I'm going to
350:43 - leave that off for now apply labels as
350:45 - per usual we'll go ahead and create our
350:46 - bucket
350:47 - and so now that we have our bucket let's
350:49 - go ahead and I'm going to create a new
350:51 - folder I'm going to call it Star Trek
350:54 - okay and what I'll do is I'll just go
350:56 - grab some images to upload just a couple
350:58 - images and I'll be back here in a second
350:59 - okay all right so let's go ahead and
351:02 - upload some files so I'm going to click
351:04 - into the Star Trek folder we're going to
351:05 - hit upload files I'm going to go into my
351:07 - Star Trek folder and I have a couple of
351:09 - Graphics from my uh one of my previous
351:11 - courses here we'll hit upload and you'll
351:14 - see the files upload and there they are
351:16 - if you want to go ahead and download
351:17 - them there's a download button on the
351:19 - right hand side we have some other
351:21 - options uh here nothing super important
351:24 - I'm going to go ahead and delete these
351:26 - files
351:27 - okay
351:30 - and give that a moment
351:35 - not that this would cost us anything to
351:37 - keep these two teeny tiny files around
351:39 - but it's probably a good habit to learn
351:41 - how to delete stuff at this level here
351:44 - uh and I'll go ahead and delete my new
351:47 - bucket
351:48 - and we will type in delete to permit and
351:50 - delete it
351:52 - okay and there you go that is Google
351:54 - Cloud Storage
351:56 - [Music]
352:00 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
352:02 - and we are taking a look here at
352:04 - bigquery so what I want you to do is go
352:06 - to the top and type in bigquery and this
352:09 - is one of Google's Flagship products
352:11 - because it does something that other
352:13 - cloud service providers does not do and
352:15 - it's the fact that it's a serverless
352:17 - data warehouse so other providers like
352:20 - redshift or
352:23 - um I'm kind of forgetting the one Azure
352:25 - uh synapse uh things like that they are
352:29 - not serverless that means that they have
352:31 - an idle cost that you pay for and
352:33 - they're generally really expensive uh
352:35 - but uh bigquery is very cost effective
352:38 - because it can scale to zero and you're
352:40 - paying for consumption okay so uh for me
352:44 - it's actually a service I definitely use
352:46 - on a regular basis and I really really
352:48 - like it so just to kind of give you an
352:50 - idea of how this works now if you have
352:53 - not attached your credit card yet and
352:54 - you're using the sandbox it is totally
352:56 - safe to do this but if you do have your
352:58 - credit card attached I probably suggest
353:00 - not queryinged if you're trying to be
353:01 - cost effective here but they have a
353:03 - bunch of data sets here and so here is
353:05 - one for covid and a lot of these are
353:08 - public data sets or I mean this one is
353:10 - at least
353:11 - and that means that Google has made it
353:13 - available to you and for this one in
353:15 - particular
353:16 - for new users you can store up to 10
353:18 - gigabytes of data up to and query up to
353:20 - one terabyte each month for free
353:23 - so you can really play around with
353:24 - bigquery in that sense once you attach a
353:26 - credit card it's no longer free
353:28 - actually I'm not really sure if if it's
353:30 - if it's still extended to be free
353:31 - outside of sandbox mode uh but I can't
353:34 - be certain okay so if we go back here we
353:37 - don't have to do anything the data set's
353:39 - already there we just have to reference
353:41 - it so it was a bit hard to find any
353:43 - available queries but I did find one on
353:45 - this blog post so thank you whoever did
353:47 - this and let's go ahead and grab this
353:50 - here
353:50 - and see if we can run ourselves a
353:53 - successful query notice it's going to
353:55 - suggest how much data it's going to
353:56 - process this is important because it's
353:58 - our consumption and we'll go ahead and
354:00 - hit run
354:01 - okay
354:03 - and we will see what we get back and so
354:04 - there we there we go we got some data
354:06 - back you go ahead and explore the data
354:08 - so export in data Studio or geoviz so if
354:11 - you have some other things there you
354:13 - could see that data create some live
354:15 - dashboards and things like that but
354:17 - that's pretty much it that's all I
354:18 - really wanted to show you
354:20 - um and that is bigquery
354:22 - [Music]
354:27 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
354:28 - and in this video we're just going to
354:30 - take a peek into vertex AI
354:33 - um I just like doing this because at
354:35 - some point you know maybe your company
354:37 - or or you might be considering to do a
354:39 - little bit of ml okay uh and the thing
354:42 - is a lot of people are scared of it and
354:43 - they're really worried about it being
354:44 - extremely expensive and so this is kind
354:46 - of my way of just kind of getting your
354:48 - toes toes uh uh into the pool
354:51 - um so you're not too afraid to do it so
354:53 - we'll go ahead here and type in vertex
354:54 - AI that is gcp's offering and we'll go
354:58 - ahead and just enable it
355:00 - and I wonder if I can do it in Canada I
355:02 - always like to pick Canada if I can
355:03 - Montreal because if it was Toronto they
355:06 - just don't have data I mean they have
355:07 - data centers there but there's never
355:09 - data centers for the main providers
355:11 - there
355:12 - and so uh we chose our region okay
355:16 - and I just want to do anything like
355:20 - opening a notebook that's usually uh
355:22 - what we would want to do
355:24 - but what I really want to show you is
355:25 - about compute because that is the the
355:27 - hidden cost uh to any type whether it's
355:31 - sagemaker
355:33 - um uh Azure ml Studio or data Studio ml
355:37 - Studio I can't remember off the top of
355:38 - my head was called vertex AI it's just
355:40 - that you have to remember to turn off
355:41 - the servers if you remember that it's
355:43 - very not scary to use
355:46 - um these services so if we want to have
355:49 - a notebook so migrate your notebook I
355:50 - don't have any right now but I just want
355:52 - to run anything so we'll go ahead and
355:54 - create ourselves a new instance and so
355:57 - here uh just like all the other ones
355:58 - you'd have to choose your environment
356:00 - Cuda or gpus you do not want to touch
356:03 - because those are super super expensive
356:05 - so we will just choose python3 notice it
356:07 - comes with scikit learn pandas and more
356:09 - that's usually the safest one here
356:12 - if you look here it'll tell us what it's
356:14 - spinning up so four vcpus 15 gigabytes
356:17 - of RAM 100 gigabyte standard so it's
356:19 - pretty darn large but that's pretty
356:20 - standard for uh what you'd want to use
356:24 - um so what we'll do is go ahead and hit
356:26 - create actually let's go take a look at
356:27 - Advanced options I've never clicked that
356:29 - before
356:31 - um nothing exciting there so we'll go
356:33 - ahead and hit create notice it says a
356:35 - hundred and two dollars a month so you
356:37 - if you're afraid to run this don't do it
356:39 - but I mean we're going to turn it on and
356:40 - turn it off so it's like not going to
356:42 - cost us much right
356:44 - um so I'll go ahead and spin that up
356:46 - there
356:48 - okay
356:51 - and I'm not sure how fast this is going
356:53 - to start up on AWS they have like ones
356:57 - that will start up within one or two
356:59 - minutes but I don't think that's
357:01 - something that is offered on gcp or or
357:04 - azure
357:06 - so the green usually means it's running
357:08 - setting up the proxy to Jupiter lab so
357:11 - this is what we really want to do is we
357:12 - want to open up Jupiter lab
357:14 - so we'll just have to wait a little
357:16 - while until that's ready okay so I'll
357:18 - see you back here in a moment
357:20 - all right so after waiting a very short
357:21 - while there now we can see we have this
357:23 - open Jupiter Labs we'll go ahead and
357:25 - click that and that will give us our
357:27 - Jupiter lab environment this is just an
357:29 - IDE specialized for data scientists or
357:32 - people working in the data field notice
357:34 - that it comes pre-loaded with tutorials
357:35 - which is pretty nice so we have some
357:38 - bigquery Cloud ml engine fairing storage
357:42 - um if we go in here this would show us
357:44 - how to work with bigquery pragmatically
357:47 - and the idea here is you go ahead and
357:48 - you just hit play on these okay
357:51 - uh and the idea is you if you hit play
357:55 - I'm not too afraid of doing this if you
357:57 - want to just watch that's totally fine
357:59 - as well but uh here it says locations
358:01 - are required Etc et cetera so that ran
358:04 - and so here this would just query some
358:06 - public data set so that's something we
358:09 - did when we did bigquery we just ran a
358:11 - query there but if we hit run
358:13 - it should output the results notice
358:15 - there's a asterisk it just means that
358:16 - it's running so give it a bit of time
358:17 - and so there is its data so this is
358:20 - pretty um
358:21 - you know this is pretty uh uh you know
358:24 - pretty straightforward
358:25 - um and very similar experience to the
358:27 - other providers there so once you learn
358:28 - one you kind of learn them all but yeah
358:31 - the real thing that you got to be a bit
358:32 - fearful of is the fact that uh you know
358:35 - depending on the machine type you choose
358:36 - they get really expensive so what you
358:38 - can do I'm just going to check if they
358:39 - have them on the left hand side here
358:40 - sometimes the providers will have like a
358:43 - category just for compute but when
358:45 - you're actually in Jupiter Labs you can
358:47 - go over here
358:48 - um oh it shows the kernel session if
358:50 - you're on
358:51 - um uh AWS they would actually show you
358:53 - the compute here that you can shut it
358:54 - down but what we can do is if we're
358:56 - really concerned about it we just go
358:57 - here and stop stop the instance okay
359:01 - but the thing is is that you could also
359:03 - be paying for storage so that could be
359:05 - kind of expensive so I'll actually just
359:06 - go ahead and delete it but we have to
359:08 - stop I think the instance before we can
359:10 - go ahead and delete it so we'll give
359:12 - this a refresh here
359:14 - okay and while that's going I just want
359:16 - to show you something else actually I
359:17 - really like this channel called by Cloud
359:19 - because uh they cover a lot of different
359:21 - kind of AI techniques but the reason I'm
359:23 - bringing it here is not to promote this
359:25 - channel but more so because they'd like
359:27 - to link in these Google collab files and
359:29 - so Google collab is kind of a way of
359:33 - um utilizing it's kind of it's like a
359:35 - notebook it's a like a jupyter notebook
359:37 - uh or it might may be a jupyter notebook
359:40 - it just doesn't look one-to-one with the
359:41 - Jupiter Labs notebook but it allows you
359:44 - to run ml models but also to utilize
359:48 - gpus and gpus uh like your graphics
359:50 - cards are really really expensive in the
359:53 - cloud and so this is an opportunity
359:54 - where you can use it for free and you're
359:55 - just sharing it with other people and
359:57 - it's one of Google's initiatives to
359:58 - allow you to learn in a cost-free way
360:01 - with Google and I think it's really cool
360:02 - but you can just click through this
360:04 - stuff and kind of get a result so I'd go
360:06 - here and hit run I'll just say run
360:08 - anyway that's totally fine with that
360:10 - okay
360:12 - and I can't just say run all like that
360:15 - and this is not going to cost me
360:16 - anything like I do not have to worry
360:18 - about it so that's something that's
360:19 - really nice that Google lets you do I
360:21 - assume it's you using under utilized
360:23 - machines or machines that aren't being
360:25 - in use so if you are learning you could
360:27 - just you know use Google collab uh but
360:29 - if you uh if you need to use you need to
360:32 - build a real model to deploy then you're
360:34 - going to be doing that with jupyter labs
360:36 - and vertex AI okay so I'm going to see
360:38 - if that is finished shutting down yet
360:42 - is it done no
360:45 - it's pending uh I'm gonna shut that down
360:48 - maybe that was causing the issue there
360:55 - okay so I'll wait till it gets out of
360:57 - the pending State here
360:59 - um and this is just running I don't know
361:01 - this is even gonna do
361:02 - uh execute a 3D photo in painting it's
361:05 - gonna do something cool something
361:06 - relating uh relating to uh something to
361:09 - change poses for people okay
361:11 - but anyway um I'll see you back here in
361:13 - a moment when this is out of pending
361:15 - okay
361:16 - all right so just as I stopped the video
361:18 - it it uh it also stopped the instance so
361:21 - now I can go ahead and delete it we'll
361:23 - just say say delete
361:26 - okay and that should take care of uh any
361:28 - lingering costs just in case you're
361:30 - following along and you do not want to
361:31 - get billed a hundred dollars by the end
361:33 - of the month there probably was
361:35 - instances that were a bit cheaper that
361:36 - we could have chose uh like you don't
361:39 - have to do this I'm just kind of taking
361:40 - a look here so there probably was yeah
361:42 - so we could have we could have chose
361:44 - something like this notice that was 29
361:46 - that would have been a lot safer to do
361:49 - um because when I think of like
361:50 - sagemaker and and azure's uh ml Studio
361:54 - or Studio this is usually the cost that
361:56 - I run my notebooks at so probably just
361:58 - had a very expensive default and we just
362:00 - had to change it down below to this okay
362:03 - um I figured that was probably the case
362:04 - but I should have showed you that as
362:06 - we're doing it so you're not super
362:07 - scared so really the real cost would be
362:09 - thirty dollars and you can do a lot with
362:11 - that but again you can use Google Cloud
362:12 - for free but there you go that's it hey
362:15 - this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and
362:17 - I'm going to show you how to book a
362:19 - Google certification exam so in this
362:22 - particular one I'm booking for the cloud
362:24 - digital leader and so uh the idea here
362:27 - is we're going to go ahead and register
362:30 - for this exam
362:32 - and then we would need to choose our
362:33 - preferred language
362:35 - and what you're going to notice that up
362:37 - here this is powered by Criterion so
362:38 - Criterion is a global testing solution
362:41 - similar to psi or Pearson VUE but for
362:45 - whatever reason this is the one that
362:46 - Google is partnered with so you might
362:49 - need to log in but if you don't have one
362:51 - you'll have to go ahead and create
362:52 - yourself a new account
362:55 - and so just looking at the details here
362:57 - login password Etc address
363:01 - there's a lot of information to go on
363:03 - here so just notice for the asterisk I'm
363:05 - going to go ahead and fill all this out
363:07 - so I'll see you back here in a moment
363:09 - all right so I filled in all my
363:10 - information we'll go ahead and hit save
363:15 - great and we've created our accounts
363:17 - let's go ahead and log in
363:20 - so I'll just put in my username I chose
363:23 - I was lucky to actually get my own name
363:24 - I was really surprised
363:26 - but I'll go grab my password Here
363:36 - great and so now we can go ahead and
363:38 - register for our exam
363:43 - so here we can see all the exam
363:47 - uh exam possibilities here and so what I
363:50 - want to do is go ahead and find the one
363:52 - I'm looking for which is the
363:54 - digital team leader
363:57 - Cloud digital leader there it is
364:00 - let's go ahead and hit the Plus
364:02 - we have two options
364:03 - on-site or proctored at this time I'm
364:06 - going to do a remote proctored exam
364:12 - and so I have some options to choose
364:15 - here
364:16 - um so I think I would like today is
364:21 - the 27th oh I gotta choose my time zone
364:24 - so we'll go up here at the top I'm in
364:26 - the Toronto time zone
364:28 - and actually that's the date I want so
364:30 - it's the only date on the calendar but
364:31 - that's perfect for me
364:34 - and I need to choose my appropriate time
364:38 - and that is going to be
364:42 - 8 pm
364:45 - and so then we just have the usual
364:47 - instructions here so no shows
364:49 - cancellations reschedule retake policy
364:51 - online test center
364:52 - exam terms and conditions so you'll want
364:55 - to go through that and read this very
364:58 - very thoroughly okay
365:03 - and once you're happy with it you're
365:04 - going to go ahead and hit select
365:09 - I do not have a coupon but if you did
365:10 - you could enter it in there
365:12 - if you are happy with the time and to
365:16 - make sure it's the correct exam and the
365:18 - correct language go ahead and check out
365:23 - and so now this is where I'm going to go
365:25 - ahead and enter in my credit card
365:26 - details
365:28 - all right great so that's all filled in
365:29 - there so let's go ahead and hit submit
365:35 - and so it's just saying here that for
365:37 - our registration to be complete we have
365:39 - to receive a confirmation email
365:41 - so I'm going to wait here a little bit
365:43 - and just wait until I see that okay
365:47 - so I just want to show you here I've
365:49 - received it just was instantaneously
365:51 - which was great since it's like zero
365:52 - seconds and so it's just a refresher of
365:55 - our uh exam details there so it's going
365:58 - to really help you find that stuff
365:59 - quicker so that's all good there
366:02 - and if I go ahead and hit done
366:06 - there's nothing else to do there so
366:08 - there you go
366:09 - [Music]

hey this is Andrew Brown your Cloud instructor at exam Pro bringing you another complete study course and this time it's the Google Cloud digital leader made available to you here on free code Camp so this course is designed to help you pass and Achieve Google issued certification and the way we're going to do that is by going through lots of lecture content follow alongs and using my cheat sheets on the day of the exam so you pass and you can take that certification and put it on your resume or LinkedIn so you can get that Cloud job or promotion you've been looking for just a bit about me I was previously the CTO of multiple edtech companies with 15 years industry experience five years specializing in the cloud I'm an AWS Community hero I publish many free Cloud certification courses just like this one and I love Star Trek and coconut water I just want to take a moment here to thank viewers like you because you make these free courses possible if you're looking for more ways of supporting more free courses just like this one the best ways to to buy the extra study material at exampro.co and in particular for this certification it's gcp hyphen CDL there you can get study

your exam or what you'd like to see next so there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are at the start of our journey asking the most important question first which is what is the Google Cloud digital leader so the digital leader is a fundamental or a foundational Cloud certification that introduces you to the Core Concepts of cloud and Google cloud in particular so the certification will demonstrate a person can Define and understand digital transformation Cloud Concepts core services such as compute storage databases and networking security and cost management for fundamental certifications they like to always put a bit of emphasis on security and cost management and for the digital leader there's a lot of talk about digital transformation which is a industry term but Google uses it quite frequently not in the exam questions themselves but something we'll have to understand the certification has no known course code so I'll be calling it the gcp CDL this is the first certification you should obtain in your Learning Journey and I'll show you in the next slide uh why that is this is an easy course to pass however it is more challenging than other fundamental certifications so we'll spend quite a bit of time just describing it compared to other fundamental certifications so here is the gcp roadmap as you can see there aren't a lot of certifications for gcp which is a good thing because it's very focused however it's a bit laid out differently in the in the fact that they have professional certifications and these are not necessarily difficult so when you see a professional certification for AWS you know it's really hard but some of these or most of these are like the difficulty of an AWS associate which is a bit odd then they have an associate tier where they only have a single certification and then we have the New Foundation certification the one we're looking at today the cloud digital leader I've also divided this here we have the professional and I these are also professional certifications here but I kind of treat these as Specialties and that's what this line indicates okay so uh in terms of your learning path you should start with the cloud digital leader and especially for gcp just because of the way they write the questions it's so different from the other providers I strongly recommend that you get comfortable with the cloud digital leader very common to go for the cloud engineer and after that the cloud architect the cloud architect is like the solutions architect associate of gcp uh I mean it's harder than the uh the solution architect associate but it's not hard overall and it's not as uh code heavy or technology heavy it's More Concept heavy from there you can move on to the cloud developer or the devops just depends on your specialty and then in the Specialties it's up to you what you want to do collaboration engineer is a very unusually named certification this one in particular is it's like Administration so like it's uh you know setting up your organization and and networking it's a very odd name for a certification um but they have it there if it was me if it was me going into the Specialties I'd either go for the cloud security engineer data engineer or machine learning engineer Cloud networking I don't know how useful that is neither is the collaborator okay so how long should I study to pass the gcp CDL so if you're new to gcp you're looking at 25 hours of study this is longer than what I generally recommend for study times for fundamentals but because the exams are more difficult we'll talk about in a moment that's why it's higher if you've already passed the certified AWS certified Cloud partitioner or the Azure fundamentals you're looking at a 15 hour study time um you know there is a lot of transferable information but again it's the fact that their exam questions are uh more difficult if you've passed either the solutions architect associate or the Azure administrator you're looking at a very short study time you'll be able to knock this out in a few days okay so my recommended study time is one to two hours for 14 days uh generally with the AZ 900 or the certified Cloud petitioner I would say just book it by the end of the week for this one you need a little bit of extra time so if you want to book the exam to have confidence and make sure you're going to commit to your studies I'd say book it 10 days 11 days or even 14 days in advance okay so how does it compare against the AWS Cloud partitioner and the AZ 900 so the we'll use the cloud practitioner as the Baseline for our fundamental certifications because it was one of the earliest ones it's also one of the like the best written ones okay then we have our Azure fundamentals the AZ 900 and then the Google digital leader so Baseline is going to be one right and so the clf c01 is the easiest fundamental certification still is today as straightforward services and straightforward questions wellridden questions and that's what makes it so easy to pass and to grasp Cloud fundamental knowledge for the Azure fundamentals this is the AZ 900 it's a bit harder than the certified Cloud practitioner just because azure's services are a little bit more muddled Azure likes to or Microsoft likes to meet everyone's demands and so they really tack on a lot of stuff but that adds to a lot of confusion whereas AWS is very isolate Services the questions are slightly more difficult just the way they word them and so let's say it's 1.5 times harder when we're looking at the Google cloud or the cloud digital leader it's three times harder than the cloud practitioner and I believe that this was actually by Design because I think that a lot of people think that while because of the cloud practitioners very easy that it doesn't hold a lot of value so gcp does not decided to just make this harder I don't really agree with that approach but that's what they did now the services in gcp are probably the easiest to learn out of all the providers they're very very straightforward but the questions are presented in a businesslike scenario so it's a lot like the solutions architect associate exam and that makes it a lot harder to um to study for because you'll have to spend more time with practice exams okay and there are some Services where you'd expect additional knowledge so one example would be cloud storage or you have to actually know the the tiers of cloud storage it's something that you wouldn't see like AWS with S3 you wouldn't have to know that and so there's those kind of stuff another thing is they just have a lot of tricky questions or poorly worded questions I'd say out of the three they have the worst written exam questions uh now to say that doesn't mean you shouldn't go get the cloud digital leader I have this course here for a reason I believe there's a lot of value here but you just have to understand that you know there's tradeoffs depending on what you do with all these things okay so uh where are you going to take this exam well you can take it in person or in an online from the convenience of your own home with other providers you usually use PSI and Pearson VUE but Google uses Criterion and actually the exam experience was really good I liked it out of every single um online Proctor system I've ever used Criterion is great I don't know if they're switching over to proctoru they were using it for the G Suite certification um prior and so I don't know if they're going to switch providers it's I'm not really I've read it at one place they said they were but now they're not so I don't know but anyway if you are going to use Criterion it's pretty easy to use uh if you've never heard the term proctored it just means that there's somebody or there's a supervisor monitoring you right so even if you take it online what they'll do is they'll ask you to like uh at the start of the call to say Okay show us under your desk all four walls make sure you're not cheating right so they're there to monitor you okay and a proctor is technically also in person but a lot of times we say Proctor exams we're referring to the online exams so what does it take to pass the example you got to watch the lecture videos memorize key information you're going to need to do HandsOn labs and follow along within your own gcp account now this is the thing um if you read the if you read the requirements for gcp they say you don't have to do any follow alongs and that is a hundred percent total lie so uh it's just like there's no way there's no way you'd pass without doing follow along so I put in some followons to help you cement that knowledge in this course okay uh do paid online practice exams normally for fundamental certifications you can get away with not doing them so like the AZ 900 or the certified Cloud petitioner it's that easy but in this case you absolutely 100 percent need practice exam questions because just the way they word them they're so hard and I'm going to tell you right now I'm the only provider that I know of that actually have these questions because um you know I took the exam the day it came out and I was the first to make sure I had a lot of questions okay so this again this is harder this is very hard to pass without practice exam questions so um you know go on the platform sign up and help support more free courses but if you do pass without using uh practice exams I'd love to hear uh like uh to you and like how much extra time you had to study okay for the content outline here's another Oddity that they don't do is they don't break down each of the domains usually you'll have a percentage here saying like Okay you're gonna get 20 of questions of this so we know where to focus our time but Google doesn't do that so we'll just read through the domains here so setting up a Cloud solution environment planning and configuring a Cloud solution deploying and implementing a Cloud solution ensuring successful operation of a Cloud solution configuring access and security and the distribution of these domains are not known we do not know what they are however on the marketing website they said the following they said well general knowledge General Google Cloud knowledge and Google Cloud product services this is what the breakdown is this is not very helpful because I mean we need to know what these are right because this is what they're testing us on there's a huge breakdown for this but I mean like I guess you kind of get the idea so um do I think this is reflective yeah sure I guess so um in terms of grading you just have to get a 70 to pass it is uh scaled like most other Courses mean that it's not always uh exactly 70 to pass but generally that's what it's going to be in terms of the type of questions you'll get 60 of them so you can afford to get 18 wrong there's no penalty for wrong questions the formatted questions are multiple choice and multiple answer I think I only saw one multiple answer like out of the whole course so it was mostly multiple choice which is great but again the questions are the the actual body of the questions is the hard part okay for the duration you get 1.5 hours you get additional time a lot of other providers give you only an hour so I really appreciate they gave me extra time I cleared it within 30 minutes but I imagine that if you know if this is your first time you'll need that full time make sure you utilize all of the time when you're taking that core uh when you're taking the exam you're gonna get 1.5 minutes per questions other providers that only give you one minute per question so this exam time is 90 minutes the C time is 120 Minutes see time refers to the amount of time that you should allocate for the exam so that includes time to review instructions Show online Proctor your workspace read and accept the NDA complete the exam provide feedback at the end of the exam uh and so you do want if you're taking it online you have to show up early okay and be ready make sure your laptop is plugged in this is actually valid for three years which is great um AWS used to have them for two years I think they extended the CCP to three years Azure is they're just good forever but I like this thing where it's just three years but there you go so that is um the introduction here and what we'll do is we'll go take a look at the actual exam guide so I can just kind of talk through some of the things there like what I thought actually showed up on the exam as opposed to uh didn't okay hey it's Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are taking a look at the official exam guide on the Google Cloud website now it's a bit different than other providers which will give you a downloadable PDF but that's not what Google does they just make it inline HTML but before we do that we're just going to look at the exam overview so here you can see where I grab those General percentages it's a hundred dollar registration fee uh 90 minutes this is going to vary based on your region probably but I mean I assume it's always showed up in USD dollars they do have some recommended resources um which you can click through like these here and they are terrible and they are not relevant to the exam and I actually went through every single one of these because I thought that I might be missing out on some information I'm going to tell you waste of time don't do it um I mean like if you wanted to kind of get like indoctrined into the way Google thinks about their products sure but I did not like them whatsoever they're all available like via quick Labs there's probably Coursera courses but the reason I make this course is because I don't want you have to pay for something to get access to that and that's the whole reason here um now there actually are there are really good Resources by Google cloud or developer Advocates and that's stuff that I do recommend but this stuff absolutely not but let's make our way over to the exam guide okay and here it is it's a pretty darn long and so we'll just work our way down here and I'll just say like what I saw on the exam and what I didn't okay so at the top here we have defined basic Cloud technology so uh know the difference between traditional infrastructure or public private Cloud yeah I think I saw one or two questions on that where you had to choose between private or public Cloud Define Cloud infrastructure ownership so that's the I don't know what that means I assume that just means the shared responsibility model the share responsibility model did not show up on my exam and neither on my uh support Engineers so you know that wasn't uh very useful information essentially essential characteristics of cloud computing again uh I think actually I did see one it was uh like multi it was my only multiselect one so yeah I suppose you'd have to know that um Google doesn't have like a official definition of characters of cloud computing like Azure and AWS does so I kind of just provided one that was between the two of AWS and Azure okay another difference between uh past infrastructure service software service definitely saw questions on that describe the tradeoffs between levels of management uh flexibility when comparing cloud services didn't see any questions on that to find the tradeoffs between costs versus responsibility didn't see any questions on that either appropriate implementation alignment with given budget resources so there they might be talking about like different kinds of builtin Cloud reports or using budget alarms so that was definitely on the exam so you'd want to know that capex and Opex total cost of operations okay so AWS calls it total cost of um ownership I guess operations is what Google calls it never saw that in their documentation by the way but I included it because I assumed you know you need to know it they don't ask that there they might have had a I think they had like a example of a capex so there was one for that recognize the relationship between the two summarize the cost differences between cloud and onpremise environments not necessarily a direct question to it but a lot of questions revolve around migration or uh you know the difference between onpremise and Cloud so not necessarily call out to those questions but part of a lot of questions okay recognize uh your or general Google Cloud knowledge recognize how Google Cloud meets compliance requirements locating current cloud Google Cloud compliance requirements um nope never never had a question on that familiar with compliance report manager never had a question on that recognize the main elements of Google Cloud resource hierarchy uh yeah they actually had quite a few questions on this and these ones are hard you know I don't even know why they put this in at the fundamental level just seems too hard but I I cover this in the course for sure describe controlling and optimizing Google Cloud costs so Billy models so that's the different bill builtin models or reports Define a consumption based use model so this is all like about billing like sustainable you like sustained billing and on demand and whether you use something that is um uh like you're using reserved compute things like that describe Google Cloud's geographical segmentation strategy this is what I was surprised about the most is that there was no Global infrastructure questions on my exam whatsoever and I always give a lot of attention to Global infrastructure and networking because those are some of the hardest Concepts to understand the fundamental level but they didn't have any questions whatsoever they just focused a lot more on resource hierarchies and migration Define Google Cloud Support options uh never ever saw a single question on support like hey what do you get if you get Enterprise no questions nothing on slas either describe the benefits of Google Cloud VMS Google so compute engine VMware engine bare metal didn't have any questions on that custom versus standard sizing um nope free premium and Custom Service options attached storages preemptable VMS of course you need to know what uh preemptable VMS are but like this stuff not really like there's no questions around bare metal identify and evaluate containerbased compute options so Define the function of a container registry distinguish between VMS containers Google kubernetes engine no not really I think I might have had one question about containers I like to use cloud run identify and evaluate serverless compute options to find the function and use of app engine yes I had a few questions on app engine between the distinction of standard versus flexible so you need to know those two different plans nothing on cloud functions Define rational rational for versioning with serverless compute auctions didn't have a question on that cost and performance tradeoffs to scale to zero um no no questions to that identify and evaluate multiple data management offerings so describe the difference between Google Cloud's relational nonrelational database uh yeah I had quite a few questions on that so uh I saw all four of these options presented to me during questions describe Google Cloud's database offering and how they compare commercials offering nothing on that distinguish between mlai offerings I I think they had like one question about ML and it was just like what would you use to do vision and it was like Vision API you know that was it okay uh moving data around between pipelines uh yeah there was a lot of questions about migration so you know you had to know clearly the difference between these offerings here apply use case to a high level Google Cloud architecture so software development lifecycle never mentioned in the exams describe Google Cloud platform visibility alert offerings like that's just like billing alarms budget alarms whatever they call them describe solutions for migrating workloads lots of stuff on this lots of stuff on Migrate for anthos migrate to compute engine something you need to know down through networking no networking in the in the exam whatsoever never ever I don't even cover this in the course I don't think sdwan but it was not on the exam and I would not expect this on a fundamental certification just makes no sense describe the best connectivity option between networking security requirements um so you should know like interconnect and then establishing secure connections via VIA VPN so those are pretty standard private Google access um yeah so that's just making sure that you have an instance that doesn't go out to the internet Define identity and access features considering included so Cloud identity uh Google Cloud directory sync I am so all of those so yeah um that gives you kind of an idea um you know I would say this is not very reflective of the actual exam you know what I mean like I'd say like you know 60 70 of the stuff I saw um and I think maybe it's just that uh it's still early days and so if you're watching this from a year from now from I publish it maybe they've made more questions but I was just thinking that they just don't have a very large question bank because when I had my support Engineers take it they're getting pretty much the same stuff as I was where there was like why wasn't there any Global infrastructure stuff so you know um I was very thorough in this course because I just did not know what I was going to get and there was nobody else before me that made this course uh so I just covered everything just in case so if you're watching this from a year or two from now you should be in very good shape because I was very thorough okay foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and what I want to show you here is an additional resource that I think is going to help you pass the Google Cloud digital leader and so I'm here on the cloudgirl.dev and this website is by Priyanka she's a Google developer advocate so she knows her stuff but what I find that's really useful is she makes all these great sketches that help visualize a lot of the core services so you know I'm not doing tons of visualizations in the course uh and I'm just giving you just the need to know information but if you check these out it might help you cement the information a bit better and of course there's a lot of accompanying uh videos to these sketches here so if you go to the cloud Girls YouTube there's a lot of great videos here so strongly recommend that if you feel that you you feel that there's a deficit whether it's a compute engine or gke or whatever just to go check out these additional resources okay foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are at the start of our journey for the cloud digital leader Google Cloud certification asking the most important question first which is what is cloud computing so cloud computing uh per definition is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store manage and process data rather than a local server or personal computer and the way I like to think of it is that if you're on premise you own the servers you hire the IT people you pay the rent and the real estate you take all the risks but when you're using a cloud provider someone else owns the servers someone else hires the IT people someone else pays or rents the real estate and you're only responsible for configuring cloud services and code and someone else takes care of the rest okay so to truly understand cloud computing we have to understand how we got to Cloud hosting and the way to do that is we're going to walk through uh how servers changed over time and uh the benefits and drawbacks to these different types of servers so the First on our list here is a dedicated server this was a physical machine that you would go out to a store and you'd purchase and you'd put it in your office you'd have to set up the networking install everything even installed the operating system and the great thing about these things is that you would get full control over your server and so theoretically you would have the highest level of security possible I say it's theoretical because of course with cloud computing you have all these additional services that monitor and do things for you but this was again the earliest option out there and so they're still in use we still have dedicated servers today but you know it just made it very inaccessible for most people to be able to run web apps or Etc then we had virtual private servers so we're still using one physical machine but now what we've done is we've isolated a virtually isolated our application using something called virtual machines basically into sub machines and that allows us to run multiple workloads because if you have different machines with or sorry different apps with different requirements by virtualizing the machine we're now able to meet the needs of each application and so that was the evolution there going from there we had shared hosting this became very popular in the early 2000s if you've ever used GoDaddy or HostGator you've used shared hosting the idea is you'd have one physical machine and instead of virtually isolating each customer or tenant from each other you just had a folder on the machine and you could have hundreds and hundreds of businesses on a single machine and the way the system worked is that you know you had limits in place but also there was an expectation that there just would be a lot of people that would be under utilizing the physical machine and so there'd just be a few people that might over utilize it and so it'd work out to be very cheap but you know because it's not full virtualization you don't have full access to the OS and things like that so it was very limited and there is also the chance that some other customer could end up over utilizing the machine and that could impact your workload all right so then came along Cloud hosting and this is where instead of having a single machine you had multiple machines and they would have virtualization right and so the idea is that now you could have a lot more customers on the exact same machine and it's highly distributed so you don't have to worry about One customer over using a single machine and you basically get the best of all worlds so it's flexible scalable it's really secure it's really cost effective it's highly configurable and that's basically the reason why Cloud hosting or cloud computing is so uh popular today so before we talk about Google Cloud we need to ask ourselves what is Google so Google is an American multinational technology corporation headquartered in Mountain View California and its claim to fame was in 1996 when they invented the Google search engine and so uh the reason why this is such a big deal was that prior to Google and really it didn't really take off until 2000 because I remember when this thing came out where we saw Mass adoption but it was just that other search engines at the time like Alta Vista hotbot all the ones out there just couldn't do a very good job of finding things but Google was smart that they would actually look at the contents of web pages they would cache them and that's how they would determine whether to serve you content another very impressive thing that they did was they didn't use highend machines that didn't have the money but they had the money to buy up a bunch of low end machines and that created new technology to distribute compute and storage across those machines and that technology is now open source and it's called Hadoop and we'll talk about it later in the course but that is something that was very impressive as well so the name Google is actually a play on the word Google it's just a different spelling and that word precisely means 10 to the power of 100 and so if you represent it out in this way the idea was that you had a one followed by a lot of zeros and so I guess this is Google saying hey we are a data driven company we work with a lot of data and that's true they do Google is also an initialism for Global organization of oriented group language of Earth you can tell that they came up with the word Google and then they just decided to try to make it uh into something make it to something so I know that doesn't make a whole lot of sense so that's just you know they're having fun I guess back then another thing we need to understand is what is a cloud service provider so a cloud service provider commonly abbreviated to CSP is it company which provides multiple cloud services and those cloud services can be chained together to create Cloud architectures so here is a technical architecture for gcp and this is actually a web application and this is a pretty standard one so you might run your web app on a compute engine which is where your virtual machine is you might have assets and things you need to store into cloud storage so this is like your files and stuff you need a database so maybe you need a postgres data base like Cloud SQL you might have a CDN that sits in front of your web app just to Cache commonly occurring Pages then you need a mechanism to actually deploy the application so maybe you want to set all this up deploy multiple apps the same structure so you can use cloud deployment manager and maybe you have a really fun uh or a very useful way of doing customer support by having a conversational AI like dialogflow so there are lots of applications out there so this combination can get very uh very variant but this is a pretty common example okay so now the question is what is the Google Cloud platform well this is what Google calls their uh their because they are a CSP so this is what they call uh their platform and it's commonly referred to as the gcp and also it's Google Cloud so I don't know why but they don't use the word like in their logos they don't use the word platform but everyone knows it as Google Cloud platform and we all call it gcp and the first service they came out with was app engine all the way back in 2008 I don't remember them calling it Google Cloud at the time I think it was just they wanted a way for people to be able to deploy applications really easily uh so I'm a little bit fuzzy about that there but now you know when we look retroactively back you can say Okay app engine was the first service they ever released then there's also Google workspace and you're probably familiar with this uh because everyone got their Gmail over 10 years ago and so Google workspace it's just a rebranding of G suite and so it's a bundled offering of SAS products for team communication collaboration for an organization so there you got Google Calendar Gmail Google meet Google Drive Google Sheets Google Docs Google slides and you know this course isn't really about Google workspace or the G Suite but you know it does overlap because when we talk about identity getting access to your Google Cloud console things like that it can tie into Google workspace and so that's why I mentioning it here and you're going to see it mentioned a few times in this course okay so let's talk about the benefits or the advantages of cloud computing no matter what cloud service provider you're using you need to know these and they're generally six to seven points and in particular for Google Cloud they don't ask you these questions on the fundamental exam like they're not going to say can you tell me three of the six but uh they do matter you need to know them because uh contextually they help you understand how to answer other questions okay and so Google doesn't really have a list like like Azure native will actually have a page and they'll say exactly what they are and so I just had to repurpose these uh from Azure here just to so that you can understand what they are okay so the first one is that cloud computing is cost effective you pay for what you consume there's no upfront cost so the idea here is that you have ondemand pricing or pay as you go so when we're talking about AWS likes to call it on demand and Azure likes to call it pay as you go and and so that's just two different ways of saying it but the idea here is you have thousands of customers sharing the cost of resources remember when we looked at um Cloud hosting and we saw that there was more than one customer on the same machine that's how we're talking about it being cost effective because you don't have to pay for the entire machine another benefit is that cloud computing allows you to go Global within minutes okay so the idea is you if you want to launch a workload in Canada in the US in the UK wherever they have a region you just choose that region and you can launch that that's a huge Advantage than having a server inhouse whereas the larger on premise onpremises they might only have two data centers in the US and that's just not sufficient okay then we're talking about security the cloud provider takes care of the physical security and a lot of their services by default are designed to be secure so they're less likely to have issues right they're gonna they're gonna try to enforce best practices and try to lean you towards something that is uh going to be better for your benefit fit and you have granular access to control anything you want so this is something you might not have if you were selfhosting but you can say I only want this particular user in my Google console to only be able to launch instances they can't shut them down maybe they can only choose a particular size and so that level of granular control really does make it a lot more secure okay then you have reliability so a lot of services will have the ability to back up they will have they might have builtin Disaster Recovery or make it easy to strategize for Disaster Recovery you could have data replication and fault tolerance so that is something that is just a lot more better than uh than onpremise okay there's scalability so the idea is that when you need more resources you don't have to go out and buy a machine you just press a button and now you have additional additional compute and if you're not using it even like two minutes later if you say I don't need this anymore you just shut it down and so you only have to pay for the duration that it runs and the idea is you can scale up very quickly uh so you know the the Your Capacity is very fitting to that then there's a concept of elastic and so scale scalable means you have the ability to add or remove machines or or compute or storage but elastic means that you can also automate that so the idea is that imagine you have a web app and a week goes by and you know the weekend's coming up it's Black Friday so you know there's going to be a lot of sales and so you might not be around to provision enough machines you might not know how many machines to provision for that event but uh with uh the cloud you can automate it so it'll just say okay you have a lot more capacity now we'll just do it for you we'll spin it up to meet whatever that demand is and when people stop using it we'll we'll scale down the machines for you we'll just get rid of them for you okay and the last Point here is that the cloud is always current so the idea is you have all this underlying hardware and it has to be patched it has to be upgraded there's always new technologies coming out and that stuff is being swapped out all the time by the cloud provider and they're experts at it right whereas if you bought a physical machine you're going to hold on to it for like 10 years but they might be switching out machines every year okay so you're going to have uh you know the Best in Class Hardware underlying okay or access to things okay foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're going to take a quick look at the four main categories of cloud services that you'll find on a cloud service provider so a cloud provider can have hundreds of cloud services that are grouped into various types of services and the four most common types I like to call these the four core is and specifically for infrastructures of service and we'll talk about IAS in the next video but we have compute so imagine having a virtual computer that can run applications programs in code then you have storage so imagine having a virtual hard drive that can store files you have networking so imagine a virtual Network being able to Define internet connections or network isolations and you have databases so imagine a virtual database for storing reporting data or a database for general purpose web application so those are the four core and we're going to give them some additional attention this course around the Google Cloud offering because we're going to see them in the exam and that's usually what these fundamental certifications are testing you on okay and so for Google they have 60 plus cloud services they have fewer than the other ones but for them it's less about having a lot of services and just having very high quality services so it's by Design you know so when you see like Azure has 200 uh it's it's a little bit too much for CCP is like okay we're just going to make sure that these services are multipurpose you don't have to have as many as these other ones okay and I just want to say that the term cloud computing can be used to refer to all categories even though it has compute in the name so you'll say and I said this I didn't say it up there but you know you might say cloud computing but you really mean everything right it doesn't matter what it is everything is cloud computing okay foreign just looking at the categories of cloud computing now let's take a look at the types of cloud computing and so we have this pyramid on the left hand side and the idea is that each type is reliant on the technology beneath it okay and so the one at the top is called software as a service also known as SAS and it is a product that is run and managed by the cloud service provider so you don't worry about how the service is maintained it just works remains available the key word here is software so imagine just using any old software but it's over the cloud on the internet so Salesforce Gmail Office 365 you could even consider Facebook or Twitter software as a service okay and these are specifically for customers the next layer is platform as a service uh also known as pass and this focuses on the deployment and management of your apps so you don't worry about provisioning configuring or understanding the hardware OS you can just upload your code and it will do the rest okay and so here we would have things like elastic Beanstalk on AWS Heroku or Google app engine and this is the original logo and I always love this logo so I use it whenever I can but the idea is that if you have a web application you just want to deploy it and just focus on your code that's what a pass is and this is specifically for developers and then on the bottom we have infrastructure as a service iaas there's no easy way to say say this as one word but this is the basic building blocks of cloud it provides access to networking features computers and data storage space so you do not worry about the IT staff the data center and the hardware and for this we have Microsoft Azure AWS for Google cloud and this is specifically for admins and basically when we talk about a cloud service provider one of the key components or characteristics of a closet service provider is that they have an infrastructure as a service offering if they don't have that we don't usually call them a cloud service provider we just call them a cloud platform and Google Cloud originally was a cloud platform you didn't have iaas offerings and so that's probably where the origin of the name comes from okay foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at the Shared responsibility model and this is a simple visualization that helps you determine what the customer is responsible for and what Google is responsible for related to the Google Cloud platform and every cloud service provider has one of these models they vary generally the categories are different they just break them down slightly different but generally they're all the same so we're going to spend a little bit extra time with the shared responsibility model just because it does show up on the exam and it's a very important concept so I just want to make sure that you know it crystal clear and from all angles okay so generally these things are broken down into different categories so we have infrastructure as a service platform as a service software as a service the types of cloud computing and then we have along the side a bunch of categories of responsibilities and this again these are Google specific ones so you have content access policies usage deployment web app security identity operations access and authentication network security guest OS us data and its content audit logging networking storage and encryption Hardware kernel IPC it's an inter protocol something something it doesn't matter but it's just something the level the boot hardware and so the idea is that you have things that are Google responsible and things that you're responsible for so for a software it's a service and notice how much blue there is you have the least responsibility which is great because then you can just focus on fewer things but remember SAS is something like Microsoft Word so imagine what you could put in Microsoft Word you'd write your article right that's the content you might share it with somebody and you're just using the platform so that's SAS then you have platform as a service remember this is like something like app engine where you have your web application you built it Ruby on Rails larvarell next.js whatever you want you deploy it you upload your code so that's the content itself and you you have to choose how you want to deploy it and you're responsible for the security of that application because you're the one who built it right um so there's that there's infrastructure as a service this is the basic building blocks the idea here is you can launch a virtual machine and so if you do that then you are responsible for the guest OS so you're actually adjusting OS layer stuff and then everything under uh underneath is um is Google's responsibility so the customer is responsible for the data and the configuration of access controls that reside in gcp the customer is responsible for the configuration of cloud services and granting access via permissions notice I keep using the word configuration I highlighted in red this is to help you remember if you can configure it you're responsible for it Google is generally responsible for the underlying infrastructure so it's the hardware this is a concept from AWS I wish all of them would use it but the idea is there's in the cloud and of the cloud so in the cloud is talking about you the customer if you can configure or store it the customer then you are responsible for it and of the cloud is if you cannot configure it then Google is generally the one that is going to be responsible for it okay so now that we've looked at the Google's shared responsibility model let's take uh something like compute and compare it across different types of cloud computing so we can understand and practice uh you know what we would be responsible for or not responsible for so we have infrastructure as a service platform as a service software as a service and notice we have another one here called function as a service you don't usually see these in the shared responsibility model and it is a type of cloud computing but it's kind of a bit of a hybrid okay so it's kind of an edge case and it's going to just help us understand some of the caveats and how these models are a little bit flawed okay so starting at the the bare bottom where we have the most responsibility is with bare metal and so bare metal um just means that uh it's a physical machine and you're basically responsible for everything else you just want the the cloud service provider to take care of the hardware for you so you have control over the host the host operating system so literally what's going to be installed on the uh at the lowest level and so at this level that means you can control the hypervisor if you want to install some type of different kind of virtualization or have no virtualization all it's all up to you and so you are the most responsible this layer then you have VMS virtual machines and so this would be compute engine I wrote compute engine here because I'm not really sure what the offering is for bare metal bare metal is expensive so that's just why okay but for uh virtual machines uh here the idea is you're responsible for the guest OS configuration level that's the OS that is running when you have um you know a sub machine running on top of the hypervisor you can also install a container runtime and so when you think of and technically uh technically this is a little bit of an odd one because for Google you can actually check box on and say I want this virtual machine to have containerization so technically technically this would be Google's responsibility but if you wanted to you could install your own container runtime okay and so uh here we see Google is responsible for the hypervisor and the physical machine all right looking at containers and we have a few different options here but we'll talk about Google kubernetes engine gke and the idea here is that you are not worrying about the OS anymore you're configuring your containers and you're worried about the deployment of the containers and the storage of your containers so Google's taking care of the the OS if there's a hypervisor a hypervisor and if there's a and the container runtime so they're doing a lot of stuff there and so you're getting less and less responsibility then you have platform as a service so this would be a managed platform like app engine and so here you're just uploading your code you're say you have some configuration of the environment you have to choose the type of deployment strategy you want you have to configure any Associated services but Google is going to be responsible for the server the OS the networking the storage the security a lot more stuff okay then you have software as a service there's not a lot of SAS products on Google Cloud but like we'll just pull it from the Google workspace or G Suite like Google Docs and so here you're just worried about the contents of the documents the management of files the configuration of sharing access controls and Google is just responsible for the server the OS Network the Storage security uh deployments other like more more stuff than platform of service then you have function as a service and this one's a bit of an oddball because uh here it is this serverless compute okay Cloud function is a serverless but you upload your code sounds a lot like platform as a service but you don't have to worry about deployments about scaling anything else it takes care of everything so deployment container runtime networking Storage security physical machine uh you know every everything okay there's another service I don't have it on here but it's called um it's called Uh Cloud run and that is a serverless container and so that's where you have it and it's it's technically containers it's technically server serverless so it kind of like fits fits in the middle so I'm just saying that there's some variation there the exam is not going to be that hard to figure out what these are but I just want you to know that there is some caveats or variations to this stuff okay it's not clear cut as you might think it is just to give a better visual here we'll just go across bare metal dedicated host virtual machines container functions we didn't cover this I just didn't have room but there was sole tenant node because when you have a virtual machine right a virtual machine can either be single tenant or multitenant and so what that means is that when it's multitenant and that's the whole advantage of cloud is that you have the same you have multiple customers using the same physical machine but you're virtually isolated using having your own virtual machines but if you wanted to have the entire physical machine you could have a sole tenant node so you're the only person on that physical machine with those virtual machines and so that's something that's in between Bare Metal and virtual machine okay so just looking at the responsibility of the customer level of control like look at code here so code you're responsible across the board for app containers it's up to the containers it functions you you're not responsible for it for the run time you have control over that in containers right if you want to run Ruby you can just make a ruby Docker file and upload it now you can run Ruby code you know if they didn't support it for the operating system you have control the guest OS here for virtual machines for the dedicated hosts it's still guest OS and then at the bare metal it's Hardware OS for virtualization if you want to change out the type of hypervisor or virtualization method only bare metal is going to let you do that so hopefully that gives you a very clear picture of the shared responsive model in action and for different types of categories it's going to be completely different okay so let's take a look at an alternate way of viewing the shared responsibility model and this is the way AWS and Azure does it and the reason I want to show it to you is because it's a lot more uh encompassing of everything that the cloud can offer you whereas the Google shared responsibility model is really focused on the application so you can really tell their developers right but it's important for you to understand the full scope so we have the customer and we have gcp so gcp is responsible for the hardware and the global infrastructure so the regions right uh you know like the everything that it has to do with regions uh the zones and zones is a collection of data centers within a region and the fault domains fault domains is a logical isolation isolation of uh Hardware that's within a Data Center and then there's the physical security of the data center they're responsible for that as well right then you have software so this breaks down to the core4 so you got your compute your storage your database and your networking now on to the customer side there's the configuration of managed services or thirdparty software so that could be platforms applications IAM IM is a big one that's a huge huge component for customer responsibility configuration configuration of virtual infrastructure and systems so operating systems the network firewall so I notice you see networking down below so we're talking about the actual like routers and switching things like this and up here this is like Cloud networking okay this is like I want to create a VPC and I want to have these subnets in it and I want to use these Cloud networking services but you're not really dealing with lower level software like setting up the the switch or the router or things like that okay then you have security configuration of data so uh you know whether to use clientside data encryption whether you are whether you're using serverside encryption whether you turned it on what type of encryption you want to use protecting the network traffic so whether you're monitoring it and put any other kinds of controls to say okay who's allowed to see what and your customer data that's a big one okay so yeah this is basically the AWS and Azure way of looking or sorry I said Azure but it's more like AWS and Oracle Azure actually has their own way it's actually looks a lot more like this and so there's they do onpremise they put onpremise in the mix infrastructure as a service platforms service and software as a service and so they just break it down to here and these are going to look very very very similar to the Googles one so you have applications data runtime middleware OS virtualization server storage networking how menus are one two three four five six seven eight nine these almost almost match up to the OSI layer that's the uh like the layers like the application layer the networking layer things like that and so that's basically how Azure kind of does it but it just helps you to see the names in a different way so you can see there's still data there's no mention of like access controls but it's just assumed that if you have an application you're responsible for it you know things like that okay so hopefully that gives you a really clear understanding of the shared responsibility model hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at the cloud computing deployment models this one's an important one it will show up in your exam so you want to know the difference starting the top here we have public cloud and this is where everything is built on the cloud service provider this is also known as being Cloud native so the idea here and I know this is an AWS example and we're doing gcp just didn't have time to make the new uh the new graphic here but the idea is that you have a virtual machine and a database that's sitting within subnets within a VPC both AWS and Google call their vpcs the same thing so that makes it easy here and everything's contained within the cloud series provider there's no cloud services outside the cloud service provider okay then you have private Cloud this is where everything is built on the company's data center this is also known as onpremise because it's on the premises uh where your office is and so here you would use something like openstack to have private a private Cloud so openstack I believe it's by Rackspace and the idea here is that it gives you a a lot of the benefits where like imagine you want to distribute a virtual machine across many machines you want to have granular permissions like IAM and things like that that's what private cloud is going to do for you then you got hybrid and hybrid cloud is where you are using both private and public cloud and you're connecting them right you're off offloading some of your private Cloud compute storage stuff to the public cloud and that's happening via some kind of hybrid connection okay and then we have cross Cloud also known as multicloud a lot of people will call it hybrid Cloud it's not hybrid Cloud hybrid cloud is when you have a private cloud and a public Cloud connected a crosscloud is when you are using multiple multiple csps and the the workload is spread across them a really good example here is something like Azure Arc or for Google's offering they call there's anthos so the idea is that you have a control plane that will control compute across multiple customers providers in onpremise environments multicloud multiple Cloud providers or multicloud is just when you use multiple providers but you don't necessarily use data across them okay but Google is going to just treat multicloud and crosscloud as the same terminology all right to try to just kind of give this more of um uh like a business use case or who's using these things we talk about uh for uh Cloud this is or public Cloud we're fully utilizing cloud computing this is where we're using cloud and onpremise and this is where we're deploying on premise using virtualization it's sometimes known as private Cloud okay so who's using cloud like public Cloud we're looking at startups SAS offerings new projects and companies so think of Basecamp Dropbox Squarespace for hybrid we have Banks fintech Investment Management large professional service providers Legacy on premise there's reasons why they're hybrid they have to keep certain data on on premise for regulatory reasons or it could be because of um just because they've had they have so much infrastructure it's just too hard to move everything away or they have customers that are concerned about the cloud or the public Cloud when we're talking about the public sector like government or hospitals with super sensitive data or very very large Enterprises with crazy regulation like insurance companies they might want to have a hundred percent private Cloud they're starting to adopt a hybrid model so uh we're seeing less and less of this but you know like hospitals AIG which is insurance company or the government of Canada okay Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at the total cost of ownership also known as TCO to really understand what it is that uh you know we are paying for when we're using on premise and what we're paying for or not have to pay for when we're using gcp these break down to capex and Opex notice here at the top we're going to talk about that in the next slide here now Google Cloud doesn't actually ever mention TCO even though it's pretty common across all the other clusters providers but it does tie back to capex and OPEC so we're going to cover it anyway and it's good to know this okay so to understand the TCO concept I have these icebergs to really make sure or to sell you that these are icebergs I put some penguins and a whale on it for your for you the idea is that we have things that are above the surface and these are things that we generally think about and then the things below the surface under the water are the things that we're not thinking about that really helps us factor in the total cost of ownership so we're looking at things that are obvious people think about well well you know for onpremise we just have to pay for our software license fees right if you have um Microsoft servers you pay for those licenses and then on gcp well you just pay subscription fees so maybe you're not paying for the licenses but now you're just paying for uh using the services uh On Demand right and so they might look at and say well you know the costs aren't they look pretty comparable but then when you get below the surface we talk about because remember on premise you you have control you have those physical machines there right so there's the implementation the configuration the training the physical security the hardware the IT personnel the maintenance there's a lot of cost in um actually having those physical machines and all the stuff around them where as uh in the cloud service provider uh you are worried about the implementation the configuration training like how to use cloud services but you're not worried about all that other physical stuff and the idea here is that you can save up to 75 shifting over to a cloud service provider GCB doesn't have an example of a cost saving example but AWS does and they showed like 75 is going to be the same for all the csps and the idea now is all this stuff in the red here is now the cloud service provider's responsibility you don't have to worry about it so let's talk about Capital versus operational expenditures so Capital expenditures known as capex and operational expenditures known as Opex right and so on the capex side this is where you're spending money up front on physical uh infrastructure and deducting that expense from your tax bill over time so that's where a lot of people go well you know I can get this machine and then write it off uh year after year and I guess that sounds okay but you're going to save way more money way way more money than getting that that small tax benefit but let's talk about what are capex expenses so you have server server costs of the computers the storage costs are like hard drives Network costs routers cable switches backup and archive costs Disaster Recovery costs data center costs so rent cooling physical security the technical Personnel so with capital expenses you have to guess up front what you're going to plan on spending right because you're gonna do once you have those you're gonna hold on to them for a period of time right for operational expenditures the cost associated associated with the onpremise data center has now shifted to the service provider so you only have to worry about nonphysical costs so this is leasing software and customizing features training employees and customer services paying for cloud support your billing is based on cloud metrics so compute usage storage usage and with operational expenses you can try a product or service without having to invest in the equipment so you can spend a lot more time in things that matter to grow your business and you don't have to immediately commit to a bunch of stuff you have a lot of flexibility there okay so that's the huge difference hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at Cloud architecture terminology so these are very important Concepts when uh utilizing the cloud uh though Google will not ask you directly on their certification uh to describe these Concepts or to to to pick them out of a lineup of terms okay however they are still going to play into questions so we generally need to know what these things are so let's go through the Quick List here and then we'll do a bit of a deeper dive on each of these ones okay so first we have availability your ability to ensure a service remains available this is known as highly available ha you have scalability your ability to rapidly grow unimpeded you have elasticity your ability to shrink and grow to meet the demand and this has to do with the automation of it you have fault tolerance your ability to prevent a failure you have Disaster Recovery your ability to recover from a failure failure also known as being highly durable so Dr so looking first in more detail here High availability this is your ability for your service to remain available by ensuring there is no single point of failure or to ensure a certain level of performance so I got a bunch of text here but I have a Graphic that makes this really clear the idea here is that we have a load balancer and and for Googles it's called Google Cloud load balancing and the idea is that we have compute and we distribute it so it's separate virtual machines but they are in three uh different zones and the idea is that if you were to lose one or two zones you would still have a running service because the load balancer would detect that these ones are unhealthy and reroute the traffic to the remaining server okay and that helps us be be highly available then you have the idea idea of being highly scalable so your ability to increase your capacity based on the increasing demand of traffic memory and computing power okay so you have vertical scaling this is where you are scaling up you are increasing the size of the single machine right so maybe you are increasing the amount of storage the amount of compute things like that resizing the machine then you have horizontal scaling so you're you're just adding additional servers of the same size and then you're Distributing the workload across those machines okay you have high elasticity so your ability to automatically increase or decrease Your Capacity based on the current demands of traffic memory and computing power sounds very similar to the last slide but the key difference is that it's automated and you also have the ability to decrease okay so the idea here is that you have the constant of horizontal scaling where you can scale out but you can also scale in so scaling out is when you add more servers and scaling in is when you remove servers okay and generally generally speaking when we're doing uh uh things that are elastic it's usually of the same size there is an exception where you can have containers I think it's like mesos or whatever they allow you to have mix and match of different kind of containers but generally it's the same size containers okay or virtual machines I should say so vertical scale is generally hard for traditional architecture so you're not going to see the concept of elasticity with vertical scaling it's with horizontal scaling okay the way we can do um horizontal scaling or elastic automatic scaling is with managed instance groups with Google so this is automatically increasing or decreasing the response uh to a demand or a defined schedule next we have fault tolerance so your ability to uh for your service to ensure there is no single point of failure or preventing the chance of failure so I'm just going to lay out all this stuff here and so it sounds very similar to high availability but the idea is that it's all about preventing chance of failure so the idea is that imagine or I guess it's kind of the response of failure so the idea here is that let's imagine you have a database and the primary database for whatever reason fails okay and so the idea is that your Cloud DNS which is at the like your domain level what it can do is say Okay fail over to the secondary instance so you have a redundant application running you're syncing that data over it's a standby service the idea is that it's ready to take over when the first one fails okay so whether something happens we can fault over to it I know it gets confusing with high availability we have high durability your ability to recover from a disaster and to prevent the loss of data so solutions that recover from a disaster is known as Disaster Recovery how do you back up your data how fast can you restore that backup does your backup still work how do you ensure your current live data is not corrupt so there you go that is our terminologies okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at the evolution of computing your cloud service provider has all of these offerings and the idea is that you need to choose the one that meets your use case a lot of times this all has to come around the utilization of space that's what we're trying to illustrate here in this section here and the tradeoffs of why you might want to use some of these offerings okay for dedicated we're talking about a a physically a physical server wholly utilized by a single customer that's considered single tenant and for Google Cloud we're talking about single node clusters and bare metal machines where you have control of the virtualization so you can install any kind of hypervisor or virtualization you want in the system the tradeoff here though is that you have to guess up front what your capacity is going to be and you're never going to 100 utilize that machine because it's going to have to be a bit under in case the utilization goes up that's you choosing the CPUs and the memories you're going to end up overpaying because you're you'll have under under utilized server it's not going to be easy to vertically scale it's not like you can just say resize it because the machine you have is what you have right you can't add more I mean I suppose they can insert more memory for you but that's a manual migration so it's very difficult and replacing the server is also very difficult okay so you're limited by the host operating system it's not virtualized so whatever is on there is on there and that's what your apps are going to have access to if you decide to run more than one app which is not a good practice for these kind of machines you're going to end up with a resource sharing we're one machine might utilize more than the others technically with a dedicated machine you have a guarantee of security privacy and full utility of the underlying resources I put an asterisk there because yes it's more secure but be uh but it's up to you to make sure that it's more secure so you have that's up to your skills of security right whereas if you had a virtual machine or anything above that there's more responsibility on the cloud service provider to just provide a secure machine and they can do a better job than you so why would you use a dedicated machine well maybe you're doing high performance Computing where you need these machines like very close together and you have to choose what kind of virtualization you need to have okay so then we're looking at virtual machines the idea here is you can run a machine within a machine the way that works is we have a hypervisor this is a software layer that lets you run the virtual machines and the idea here is now it's a multitenant you can share the cost of multiple customers you're paying for a fraction of the server you'll still end up overpaying for the other virtual machine because a virtual machine is just like you have to still say how many vcpus how much memory and your app is you know you don't want an app that uses 100 right you want to use exactly the amount you need but you can see here you know there's still going to be some under utilization uh you are limited by the guest operating system not but now it's virtualized so at least it's very easy to uh possibly migrate away if you choose to run more than one app on a virtual machine it can still run into resource sharing conflicts it's easier to export or import images for migration it's easier to vertically or horizontally scale okay and virtual machines are the most common and popular offering for compute because people are just very comfortable with those then you have containers and the idea is you have a virtual machine running these things called containers the way they do that is similar to a hypervisor but instead you have like here is a Docker demon so it's just a um a container a software layer okay to run those containers there's different kinds Docker is the most popular and the great thing is you can maximize the uh the the capacity because you can easily add new containers resizes containers use up the rest of the space it's a lot more flexible okay your containers will share the same underlying OS but they are more efficient than multiple VMS multiple apps can run side by side without being limited by the same OS requirements and not cause conflicts during resource sharing so containers are really good but you know the tradeoff is there are a lot more work to maintain then you have functions functions go even step further and the idea is that you uh the the containers where we where we talked about that's a lot of work to maintain now the Clusters provider is taking care of those containers generally sometimes not it depends if it's serverless or not but the idea is that you don't even think about this is called serverless compute but you don't even think about uh the OS or anything you just know that what your runtime is you run Ruby or python or node and you just upload your code and you just say I want this to be able to run uh for this long and use this amount of memory okay you're only responsible for your code and data nothing else it's very cost effective you only pay for the time the code is running and VMS only run when there is code to be executed but because of that there is this concept of cold starts and this is where the virtual machine has to spin up and so sometimes requests can be a bit slow so there's a bit of tradeoff there but functions or serverless compute is generally one of the best offerings as of today but more most people are still getting kind of comfortable with that Paradigm okay this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are taking a look at Global infrastructure so what is global infrastructure well it refers to the global presence of data centers networking and Cloud resources available to the customer and so just kind of some of the stats that Google cloud has they have 25 regions 76 zones 144 Network Edge locations operating in 200 plus countries so just an idea like here is an example of the exterior of a Google Data Center and this is an interior so we're going to go and dive deep on all these Cloud infrastructure Concepts starting now hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at regions for Global infrastructure so regions are independent Geographic areas that consist of zones and gcp has 25 regions so here we have a map and you're going to notice that some are blue and some are white white ones indicate that they are planning to have regions there in the future in the next three years and I think most of most of not all of their regions always have three zones in them so that's pretty good on them so for the Americas we've got Oregon Los Angeles Salt Lake City Las Vegas Iowa South Carolina North Virginia Montreal Sao Paulo for Europe we have London Belgium Netherlands Zurich Frankfurt Finland Warsaw in Asia Pacific we have Mumbai Singapore Jakarta Hong Kong Taiwan Tokyo Osaka Sydney and Seoul okay so there's quite a few of them uh I mean like a lot of people are used to running in U.S West or U.S east I'm always running in the Canada region because that's where I'm from so it's there but yeah when you actually want to go user region it's as simple as choosing it so if I'm launching a virtual machine with compute instance their compute engine you're just going to choose the region you want to go in okay this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at Google Cloud's Global infrastructure Edge Network and so Edge networking is the practice of having compute and data storage resources as close as possible to the end user in order to deliver the lowest latency and to save bandwidth and so we're talking about Edge networking we're always talking about points of presence pop or pops and this is an intermediate location between a gcp region and the end user and this location could be even in a thirdparty data center or it might just be described as a collection of Hardware so maybe it's not even a data center at all and so here is the big old graphic that um that Google has for us and if you see all those wires that's basically it's just showing how things are interconnected the actual Global Network between these pops and actually there's three types of um of Pops or things we want to look at for Edge networking at networking devices or things and this graphic will change for all three this one is I think for Edge pops so just understand that it's not represented of all these three types but the first is Edge pop so a location where a user can quickly enter so Ingress the gcp network for Accelerated access to Cloud resources then you have a CDN and this is a location to serve so egress leave to lead the network for cash websites files assets so they load very fast for the end user then you have Cloud media Edge this is a location specialized for the delivery of media such as video content and so there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at zones for Google Cloud's Global infrastructure so a zone is a physical location made up of one or more data center and a data center is secure is a secured building that contains hundreds of thousands of computers and so this is an example of the interior of a Data Center and of course you probably wouldn't want to have a dog in there unless it's a guard dog protecting those machines okay so a region will generally contain three zones and I actually think Google is very good about that they always have three zones but other providers will try to get a foothold into new regions and so they might only launch with a single zone offering but I think gcp is good in this regard the reason we make mention of that is because when we're talking about high availability the only way to get that is when you have at least three zones that's the standard okay data centers within a region will be isolated from each other so different buildings but they will be close enough to provide low latency and we'll talk about the the interlatency the interzonealange agency coming in this section here so common practice to run at least three zones to remain available in case a one or two data centers fail okay so the way you choose zones within Google cloud is after you've chosen your region you just choose your Zone and sometimes you're choosing more than one zone okay so it's that simple hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at resource scoping for Google Cloud's Global infrastructure so we were just talking about zones and I was saying that you can uh when you launch a resource sometimes you choose a single zone or multiple zones and that comes into resource scoping okay so I just want to talk a little bit more or reiterate on zones one more time so a zone is a deployment area for Google Cloud resources within a region Zone should be considered a single failure domain within a region and deploy redundant resources in multiple zones multizones for fault tolerance and high availability okay so let's now talk about product or resource scoping so the idea is you can launch a resource in a single zone in a single region so this is a zonal resource you have Regional resources this is where a resource resides in multiple zones in a single region you have multiregional resource so resources reside across multiple specific zones you have a global Service this is where resources reside globally and regions and zones are abstracted away very common with serverless Services okay and then you have internal Services these are foundational Services used by many other services you don't interact with these Services directly they're managed by Google such as spanner Colossus Borg and chubby okay so the reason I bring this up is that you know I saw a question or two on the exam and they were using this terminology and so you know it just helps you to kind of frame that question better if you know resource scoping okay Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at data residency for Google Cloud's Global infrastructure so what is data residency well it's the physical or geographic location of where an organization or Cloud resources reside and the reason we care about this is so that we can do or have compliance boundaries these are Regulatory Compliance so they're legal requirements by government or organization that describes where data and Cloud resources are allowed to reside so you know if you're working with the Canadian government and say we're only going to use your software as long as the data resides within Canadian data centers that is the idea behind the stuff so when you're trying to run these kind of workloads and you need to meet compliance boundaries strictly defining the data residency of the data and Cloud resources and gcp you can use something called assured workloads so this is a feature that allows you to apply very security controls to an environment so it's not just for data residency but that that's its primary feature so data residency personal data access controls based on attributes person uh Personnel support case ownership controls based on attributes encryption so in order to apply data residency you're going to use an organizational policy called a resource location restriction and choose the allowed region or multiple regions well to show up in the exam probably not but you know it's good to get you kind of exposed to Global or organizational policies because those kind of do show up on the exam okay foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at Cloud interconnect for Global infrastructure technically this is hybrid hybrid services and so you have this in the hybrid section but I like to put it in global infrastructure because it's just something that has to do with data centers and connecting things so that's why I always kind of front load it in this section here so Cloud interconnect provides direct physical connections between your onpremise network and Google's Network and so Cloud interconnect enables you to transfer large amounts of data between networks which can be more cost effective than purchasing additional bandwidth over uh public internet so it's a direct physical connection so fiber optics running from data center to Data Center okay and there are two offerings we have dedicated and partnered so for dedicated this is a direct physical connection between the onpremise network and Google's Network through a colocation facility we'll talk about colocation what that means here in a moment then you have a partner interconnect this is a direct physical connection between the onpremise network and Google's Network through a trusted thirdparty data center or provider okay so on the dedicated side this is between 10 to 200 gigabytes per second and for partner it's between 50 megabytes per second and 10 gigabytes per second the reason you would be using a partner one is maybe because you just can't do dedicated based on your location so you have to work through partner or maybe it's more cost effective or you know or it doesn't meet your needs so it's just going to be dependent on that kind of stuff but generally the reason people are going with partners because they just can't get the dedicated one so what is a colocation facility so a colocation or Carrier hotel is a data center where equipment space and bandwidth are available for rental to retail customers so the idea is that it's a rent like a rental data center right and Google Google uh is like is uh there's ones that they're cool with using and so those it's like you have a bit more direct control over it so you know it just depends on what you want to do okay foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at Google Cloud for government and so the first thing I want to answer is what is public sector so public sectors include public goods and governmental services such as military law enforcement infrastructure public trans transit public education Health Care the and the government itself so Google Cloud can be utilized by the public sector organization's developing Cloud workloads for the public sector and the way Google achieves this is by meeting Regulatory Compliance programs along with specific governance and security controls so some compliance programs that would be used in public sector would be HIPAA for for health fedramp for dealing with the US the criminal justice information service it's like working with the FBI and we got Phipps 140 hyphen 2 and we do cover all these again in the course so don't worry about having to memorize the second uh let's just mention fedramp so this stands for federal risk and authorization management program wraps of fed wrap it's a US governmentwide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessments authorization and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services so what is govcloud because this is something you hear a lot with cloud service providers so a CSP generally will offer an isolated region to run fed ramp workloads and gov Cloud offering in practice can result in degraded service offerings lower service availability and higher operational costs so GC gcp has an alternate to offering gov Cloud where fedramp workloads are authorized in gcp's usual region data centers and this game mitigates the disadvantages of gov Cloud offering so gcp regions will be authorized for either a high or moderate Baseline and so you know that was the thing was I was looking up gcp and I'm like where's the gov Cloud I couldn't find it and so they just have a a different way of going about it and supposedly they say that it is better I don't know all the details about it but that was what I could drum up will the show up in the exam probably not I didn't really to see anything for public sector on the exam but from fundamental information you should absolutely know this okay this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at latencies for Google Cloud's Global infrastructure so what is latency well latency is the time delay between two physical systems and what is lag well lag is the noticeable delay between the actions of input and the reactions of the server sent back to the client all right and you probably if you play video games you know what game lag is so it's basically the same thing okay it's just between servers instead of Game servers all right we have interregional latency so this is latency between two regions and then we have enter zonal latency this is latency between zones residing in a single region and I just want to generally give you an idea of the the latency in milliseconds this isn't going to be exact because I honestly couldn't find something definitive by Google and there are benchmarks out there and they vary because it's going to be between regions and different zones but I want to kind of give you kind of a bit of a de facto way of understanding generally what they'll be and so I would imagine that between two zones or sorry two regions you could see the worst case of 500 milliseconds so that's in the triple digit and then when we're talking about interzone latency maybe 10 50 milliseconds so double digit milliseconds Okay the reason this is important is because I saw a question on the exam and it actually asked about 10 milliseconds and it was talking about a high availability and if you're new if you knew that um that it's in the double digit between intersonal stuff you wouldn't have chose multiregion you would only choose a single region with um multiple zones okay so don't get hung up on so much the exact number but just understand triple digit double digit for these two okay foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are taking a look at Innovation waves actually known as chondra T waves that's a Russian name so I'm sorry if I pronounced it incorrectly but they are hypothesized cyclelike phenomenons in the global World economy the phenomenon is closely connected with technology life cycles so the idea here is that we have these waves that uh irreversibly change the society on a global uh scale and generally we underpin these for particular technological advancements okay so here we have the steam engine and cotton we have Railway Railway and steel we have electrical engineering and chemistry Innovations here we have petrochemicals and Automobiles we have information technology and the idea here is that Google is suggesting that uh the the wave that we're in right now includes Cloud technology as one of the larger factors when we look at one of these waves in a greater detail there is a common pattern to the wave that changes the supply and demand and so they say there's an expansion of boom a recession and a depression and if you can detect that pattern that's how you know that something is going on okay and so if we are in um if Cloud technology is the case here then we're definitely in an expansion phase right now uh and it's we might be in a boom it's hard to say um but uh yeah so there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at the concept of a burning platform so the term is used when a company abandons old technology for new technology with the uncertainty of success and can be motivated by fear that the organization's future survival hinges on its digital transformation so this idea is comes back to the oil industry where you would have a platform and oil would catch fire and so the only way to survive would be to abandon or jump off the platform and so this term this term is not so popular today but Google seems to still be using it but the idea is that uh you know it's just you have to take a leap of faith into this stuff if you want to keep up okay foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at the evolution of computing power so computing power is the throughput measured at which a computer can complete a computational task and Google has a variety of offerings for the Innovations in this particular field the one that we're all most common with are CPUs so this is just like what's in your computer your laptop when we're talking about cloud computing the one that we commonly see are Xeon CPU processors because they're very very uh good processors and so the offering here at any cloud service provider would be via virtual machines and so for Google their virtual machines are offered via compute engine then we're looking at tensor Computing so Google created their own machine learning deep learning framework called tensorflow and it has a new type of data structure called a tensor that is specifically optimized for you know neural networks and the idea here is that Google decided to create a piece of hardware that is specifically designed for their tensor data structure and so that's what they have which is this TPU thing and for this particular use case is 50 times faster than a traditional CPU all right and this is really for the space of neural Nets if you want to have this offering on uh Google Cloud you'd be using the cloud TPU okay and the last one here is quantum Computing and so Quantum Computing is interesting because it has the potential to be a hundred million times faster it is uh we're literally using parallel parallel uh a universe or Dimension uh using things like quantum entanglement very advanced concepts in order to perform uh insane amount of computation but this field is very early days and so being able to apply it is not very easy but that doesn't mean that you can't play around with it Google has an offering AWS has an offering for this but in particular Google has been producing uh different Hardware so the first had foxtail in 2016 then Bristol cone in 2017 and I think the latest one they have is uh Sycamore in 2018 all right and so this is all accessible via the Google Quantum AI all right foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at the concept of digital transformation and this is the adoption of digital technology to transform services or businesses through replacing nondigital or manual processes with digital processes like going paperless or replacing older digital technology with newer digital technology so that means you previously are using on premise and you're moving into a hybrid architecture or using uh Cloud native technology all right and so uh this you could describe is that Google has their own Google digital transformation framework or concept based off of Google 7 solution pillars so we have infrastructure modernization business application platform portfolio application modernization database and Storage Solutions smart analytics artificial intelligence and security so in terms of the actual exam they're not going to ask you what are the Seven Pillars or what digital transformation is but you know the exam is all um uh business use case scenario so there are some tidbits in here which might help you with some of the questions and that's why we're going to go through all the pillars okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are taking a look here at Google Cloud's solution pillars and there's seven in total here and there's a lot of text so let's work our way through it so the first is infrastructure modernization so replacing Legacy hardware and software systems with Cloud Solutions allows organizations to adopt hybrid architectures and have more infrastructure Mobility choosing a mix of best cloud service provider offerings for their organizational's use case so in this case if we're talking about hybrid architectures one service that we could utilize would be anthos and this allows you to manage compute from both onpremise and public cloud in a single unified interface moving on to business applications platform portfolio so the backbone of csps are built on top of robust welldocumented apis standardized across all offered cloud services organizations can focus on the configuration interconnections of various systems instead of having to build their own systems so what are they talking about here we're talking about Cloud SDK a cloud API Cloud CLI and the Google Cloud documentation for number three we have application modernization so building web applications on top of cloud services allows organizations to globally deliver and rapidly iterate faster than ever before csps offer automated deployment pipelines AI powered code reviews easy staging and testing of new features the ability to test in production rollback changes apps are more durable and can remain available when facing catastrophic Regional failure so one thing that makes it really easy to build up very robust web apps is if you're able to migrate your web app over to app engine because it just takes care of a lot of the stuff for you and all you got to do is upload your code and do some configuration make some choices but more or less it makes it very highly durable available and scalable then you have database and Storage Solutions so most companies can tolerate losing application code you can always write you can always write losing data is not something you can recover over cloud service providers have guaranteed slas of data durability as well as the ability to easily migrate and secure your data so in this case if we're looking at cloud storage which is on you know the storage or file side side of the the scenario here it can store files and documents as objects and its availability is 99.5 percent uh and they have an it's SLA backed okay and the way they do that is that they're replicating your data across multiple zones so if a Zone fails it'll just recover cover files from another Zone it does that automatically for you for number five we have Smart analytics so when you store data on cloud service providers you can tap into big data and business intelligence Cloud offerings assisted by AI to help you analyze your data so for Google there's looker and this is data exploration Discovery business intelligence platform acquired by Google and it is now part of gcp uh then you have artificial intelligence so AI deep learning ml or specialized domains that uh traditionally required scarce and expensive subject matter experts cloud is commoditizing uh commoditizing simplifying AI knowledge while driving costs lower for adoption so there's a lot of tools here that Google has but the the primary ones is vertex AI this is a unified platform for AIML deep learning automl they have their own deep learning framework they've developed it's really easy to use this is my uh most uh favorite framework and this is the one I always use then we have security so cloud services by default have strong mechanisms built in for security governance compliance csps are continually developing new and Innovative security offerings not just at a service per service level but to analyze recommend and remediate at the project and organization level you can easily and quickly audit and apply security controls to become compliant in a fraction of time then on an onpremise solution and so things you get uh when you're working the cloud IAM I I mean if you're using private Cloud I suppose you'd get that with openstack but I am so rolebased access controls and user management one that I really like that Google has is beyond Corp it's a zero trust model framework then there's the security Command Center so it's a centralized it centralizes visibility control for security and stuff for misconfigurations but there's a lot more there but this is just to kind of help you ground each of these pillars into something practical okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at what the Google Cloud console is and this is a portal that is a webbased unified console that provides an alternative to the command line tools it allows you to build manage and monitor everything from simple web apps to complex cloud deployments and so this is generally the main way you're going to be interacting uh with Google Cloud because it's the easiest way to do it so the idea is that you have this hamburger menu you can drop down and see all the possible Services you can also search for them you can organize different projects here and switch between them and in the background here what you can see me doing is I'm actually trying to launch a new compute engine virtual machine instance you can also get notifications and things like that but basically everything you want to do is via the console okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are taking a look here at Cloud SDK so SDK stands for software development kit and it is a collection of software development Tools in one installable package so you can use the cloud SDK to pragmatically create modify delete or interact with Google Cloud resources and the SDK is offered in a variety of programming languages so we got Java python node.js Ruby which is my favorite go.net PHP and so here is an example of us using the SDK with Ruby code so we've installed the the the package as a ruby Jam that's how we did it and we're accessing a bigquery and we're just iterating out that table okay foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are taking a look at Cloud CLI so CLI stands for command line interface and what it allows you to do is process commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text and operating systems Implement a commandlet interface in a shell or a terminal that's how you're going to interact with one and so this is what it looks like to use the CLI so once it's installed what you'll do is write gcloud and then whatever it is that you want to do so in this case we are you want to work with a compute engine so we write compute for SSH ssh into our instance and so it's just as simple as that okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're taking a look here at Cloud shell and this is a free online environment with a command line access for managing your infrastructure in an online code editor for cloud development so the idea here is these are the two interfaces uh they're very pretty similar but the idea is you'll press this little button here it will launch generally a shell and if you want to switch over to the editor you just press that and here you can see this is basically a bash terminal and this one here is a vs code environments there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're looking at projects and folders for Google Cloud so a project in Google cloud is a logical grouping of resources and a cloud resource must belong to a project so up in your navigation you're going to see the project you're currently on you can drop that down change to another project or quickly and easily create additional projects a project is made up of settings permissions and other metadata a project can't access another Project's resources unless you use share VPC or VPC Network pairing resources within a single project can work together easily for example by communicating through internal Network subject to the regions and Zone rules each Google Cloud project has the following a project name which you provide a project ID which you can provide or Google Cloud can provide for you a project number which Google Cloud provides as you work with Google Cloud you'll use these identifiers in certain command lines and API calls so each project at D is unique across Google Cloud once you have created a project you can delete the project but its IDs can never be used again when billing is enabled each project is associated with one billing account multiple projects can have their resources usage build to the same account a project serves as a namespace this means that every resource within each project must have a unique name but you can usually reuse resource names if they're if they're in separated projects then there's the concept of folder so folders allow you to logically group multiple projects that share common IAM permissions folders are commonly used to isolate projects for different departments or for different environments we'll see more of this when we cover resource hierarchies okay foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're looking at the Google Cloud adoption framework also known as gcaf and this is a white paper that can determine an organization's Readiness to adopt Google Cloud as well as providing steps to fill in knowledge gaps and develop new competencies okay so to really understand the Google Cloud adoption framework we need to know what is a white paper so it is a report or guide that informs readers concisely about a complex issue it is intended to help readers understand an issue solve a problem or make a decision and white papers are generally PDF format but they could also be in HTML format as well so white papers are common among all the cloud service providers and they're almost always an essential to study at the fundamentals level and so for the Google Cloud digital leader I recommend going through the cloud adoption framework which is what we're going to do here okay so the gcap is composed of four themes through maturity phases the cloud maturity scale epics and programs so let's get into it this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at themes for the Google Cloud adoption framework so themes are just four different areas that your company needs to excel in in order to be successful with their Cloud adoption so starting at the first here we have learn the quality and scale of the learning programs you have in place to upskill your technical teams your ability to augment your IT staff with experienced Partners so who's engaged how widespread is an engagement how concerted is the effort how effective are the results number two here is lead so the extent to which it teams are supported by a mandate from leadership to migrate to Cloud the degree to which the teams themselves are crossfunctional collaborative and selfmotivated so how are teams structured have they got executive sponsorship how are Cloud projects budgeted governed and assessed the third theme Here is scale so the extent to which you use cloud native services that reduce operational overhead and automate manual processes and policies so how are cloudbased Services provisioned how is capacity for work workloads allocated it how are applications up updates manage and for the fourth one here we have secure so the capabilities to protect your services from unauthorized and inappropriate access with a multilayered identity Centric security model dependent also on the advanced maturity of the other three themes okay so what controls are in place what technologies used what strategies govern uh everything as a whole okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at phases for the Google Cloud adoption framework and this is all about the maturity of the organization because depending on where you are is going to determine the type of action or advice here based on the phase okay so for tactical this is shortterm goals which is individual workloads are in place but there is no coherent plan the focus is on reducing the cost of discrete systems getting to the cloud with minimal disruption the wins are quick but there is no provision for scale so really they're just trying to utilize anything and it's not there's no real plan in place okay for strategic this is where you are in the midterm of maturity so a broader Vision governs individual workloads which are designed and developed with an eye to Future needs and scale have begun to embrace change people and processes are not now involved in the adoption strategy it teams are both efficient and effective increasing the value of harnessing the cloud for your business operations then we have a transfer uh transfer transformative or transformationals there we go and so this is like longterm goals so Cloud operations are functioning smoothly so you're in the cloud now but you're focusing on integrating the data and insights working in the cloud so existing data is transparently shared new data is collected and analyzed predictive and prescriptive analytics via machine learning is used people in processes are being transformed which further supports technological changes it is no longer a cost center but has become instead a partner to the business hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at the cloud maturity scale for the Google Cloud adoption framework and so this is a matrix made up of the themes and phases that we just reviewed and it will help your organization pinpoint their exact adoption position so uh on the horizontal scale we have learn lead scale and secure to determine our adoption themes and then on our vertical scale we have tactical strategic and transform transformational for organizations maturity so where it intersects with learn and tactical the idea here is that you are selftaught and you are reliant on third parties for strategic learn these are organized training with thirdparty assisted for learn and transformational it's peer learning and sharing with thirdparty staff augmentation so just to kind of make sense because I know these are kind of abbreviated so it doesn't make a whole lot of sense but the idea is that if you are learning and you are in the short term phase that you're probably going to be selftaught in this right okay okay and then if you're strategic you're going to be you're going to have organized training because you are bringing people and processes in as we saw in the as we were describing the maturity phases and then for transformational we have peer learning and sharing because we're now established in the cloud but we're just trying to collect data make things a lot better okay for lead uh lead for tactical looks like it's teams by function and you have a heroic project manager basically anytime you want to adopt Cloud no matter if it's Google or other ones you need somebody and your team that's going to act as the hero or the Evangelist for that adoption uh for the adoption of the cloud and you've got to find that person to carry you through all the stages okay so for lead and strategic we have new crossfunctional functional Cloud team so this is where you actually have a specialized team in your organization because you're now in the cloud right and so that's going to help support the workloads and move further and then uh down for transformational lead you have crossfunctional feature teams great uh autonomy so the idea is you don't just have a single team but you have multiple teams that are feature specific so maybe you have data data team you have a devops team and the idea is that you also want to make sure they have the control to do what they need to do in their own space right that means in Google Cloud they're going to have their own folder her and they can selfgovern all their projects in there they're not they can do their Shadow I.T and they don't have to access centralize it to do stuff for scale and tactical so change is slow and risk is Ops heavy because basically everything is still in the old uh the old onpremise system right so that makes sense for scale and strategic templates ensure good governance without manual review so you know you just want to make sure that you have infrastructure as code is in place and you're putting governing rules in the midterm for transformational scale all changes constant low risk and quickly fixed so you're really in good shape for scale here uh you know you're just scale is going to be really easy right so whereas this you're doing a lot of automation still to try to get your scale for secure fear of public internet trust and private Network that's of course why people are on premise because they're really afraid to be in the public cloud or or uh on third parties in general so that is something you're going to have to fight with at that stage for strategic you have Central identity hybrid Network you know so that could be using the Beyond Corp which is the zero trust model or you could be doing Federation between uh your Azure active directory onprem into uh like with Cloud identity using like uh Google syncing directory service then the last one here is secure and transformational Trust only the right people device and services this is what they're talking about they're talking about the zero trust model here so that really is where Beyond Corp would come into play for the Google Cloud adoption framework okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at epics for the Google Cloud adoption framework so when you've determined where your organization is in the adoption process using that cloud maturity scale then you need to Define epics and epics are work streams to scope and structure Cloud adoption epics are defined so they do not overlap they are aligned to manageable groups of stakeholders they can be further further broken down into individual user stories if you've ever done Agile development epics and user stories are pretty darn common and you can definitely use them in jira so if you if you line these things up that's what you might want to do so we have this Venn diagram where we have three areas we've got people processes and textures broad categories of different kinds of epics everything within this Venn diagram is going to be epics okay so under people we have behaviors people people's operation communication right under process we have cost control Incident Management instrumentation for Tech we have Resource Management networking and then we have these places where the intersects so we have external experience upskilling sponsorship teamwork architecture infrastructure is code CI CD identity and access data management all right so if you're limited for time and resources focus on the epics in the colored segments and since these align with learn lead at scale and secure that's what these are when you're seeing those four okay just to help that make a little bit more sense uh there's programs and these are a logical grouping of epics that correlate to themes to allow you to focus on specific adoption efforts so the idea is that you have learned which is for training programs change management so that would be lead Cloud operation models with scale a secure account setup which is secure and the idea is like okay well there's these epics how do I know how to write them out or do user stories I would imagine that that's where you would work with Google or the Google partner Network to find somebody that actually knows how to go and implement this stuff because I did find that the documentation was a bit lacking for this but I imagine that there are people out there that have a good idea how to actually utilize this framework okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're looking at Tams which stands for technical account manager and no matter if you're using Google Cloud Azure AWS they all have Tams this is a human resource assigned to work with your organization when paying for Google Cloud's premium support So Tam can assist with Google Cloud adoption framework by performing a high level assessment of your organization's Cloud maturity tell you how to prioritize your training change management programs partner relationships Cloud operating models secure account configuration so the idea here is that you know if you don't know how to apply the Google Cloud adoption framework you want to get a tam because they're really going to help you connect you to people that do know how to do it or give you a bit of a Kickstart into that process okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at the cloud maturity assessment tool this is a guided form to assess your organizations against the Google Cloud's adoption framework along its four themes learn lead scale and secure so it's a simple multiple choice form and once you're done you'll get an email with your maturity phase so it's going to say okay for learning you're strategic right that's where you are it'll give you some additional information on how you compare it against the average uh is this tool that useful no not really it's not that hard to assess where you are but you know it is a good starting point if you're just not sure just to kind of get you warmed up to this framework okay foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at compute for Google Cloud platform and so there's a variety of services so let's get to it the first being compute engine and this one is for virtual machines or VMS and this is generally the primary or traditional type of compute you are going to utilize on a cloud service provider then there is bare metal so bare metal is where you have full control of the hardware so you can install any kind of hypervisor you want it on it or virtualization it's going to allow you to have very low latency on Google Cloud then we have iPad gym which is a platform as a service build and deploy apps on a fully managed highly scalable platform without having to manage the underlying infrastructure we're going to spend a little bit more time on app engine because the exam definitely pops up with a few questions that talk about its different core offerings we have Cloud gpus so add gpus to your workloads for machine learning scientific Computing and 3D visualization you have Google kubernetes engine also known as gke so reliably efficiently and securely deploy and scale containerized applications on kubernetes we have sole tenant nodes and this is known as dedicated virtual machines and all the other different providers so the reason you'd want to use these is you need to be compliance you have your own licenses you need to keep these instances physically separated with dedicated Hardware because maybe you know you're not allowed to run it with as a multitenant so there's all sorts of reasons for that you have Cloud functions these are functions as a service so you can create serverless single purpose functions that respond to the events I guess I could have put cloud run on this as well which is serverless containers but we have a container section so it's not a big deal we'll get to that some kind of auxiliary services that are used that are important to know or compute would be Google Cloud VM engine or VMware engine so migrate and run your VM workloads natively on Google Cloud you have migrate for compute engine so migrate servers and VMS from onpremise or another Cloud to compute engine this was formerly known as velostrata preemptable VMS so deploy affordable shortlived compute instances suitable for batch jobs and fault tolerant workloads we're going to cover that again when we go to our pricing section shielded VM so deploy hardened virtual machines on Google Cloud hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are taking a deeper look here at app engine so app engine is a platform as a service for your applications you can quickly deploy and scale web applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure and a great way of thinking of this is if you know Heroku it's basically the Heroku of gcp so the idea here is you can use your favorite programming language whether it's node.js Java Ruby C sharp go python or PHP you can also bring your own language runtime and you do that by creating a custom Docker container so there is all our familiar logos just to kind of put home as to what you can use it has powerful application Diagnostics you have Cloud monitoring Cloud logging to monitor the health of your performance Cloud debugger and air reporting to diagnose and fix bugs quickly application versioning so easily create a development test staging and production environments traffic splitting so route income incoming requests to different app versions A to B tests and do incremental feature rollouts you have application security so defining access rules with app engine firewall and you can leverage manage SSL TLS certification certificates by default so the idea is that you have all this infrastructure and this is not even the full list but all this stuff around your application uh that you would generally have to do yourself but they do it all for you okay now there are two types of environments that you can launch with app engine you got flexible and standard it's very very very important that you know the difference for the exam because they will have scenarios where you have to pick one or the other okay so you can simultaneously see use both environments for your application so it's not you'd have to use one or the other it just depends on what kind of workloads you're running an app engine is well suited to applications that are designed using microservice architecture so splitting it down the line let's talk about standard and then we'll talk about flexible so standard I would describe as being serverless compute so it starts in seconds it's going to run in a sandbox meaning that there's a like you don't have uh like you're not deploying a container it's just you're uploading your code okay it's designed for Rapid scaling so it can handle uh sudden spikes of traffic it supports specific language versions uh but it's not a custom runtime so if you've ever deployed a serverless function where you're just like choose Ruby that's the language you get of a particular version okay you're not going to get that much flexibility around that it can scale to zero instances so that's another characteristic of serverless compute its pricing is based on hours it cannot you cannot use SSH to debug it which is very common for serverless apps there are no background processes when we're looking at flexible these are fully managed containers so it starts in minutes runs with Docker containers on a compute engine VM so that's what it's doing underneath it's designed for predictable and consistent traffic it supports generally any language version or you can run a custom runtime must have at least one instance running the pricing is based on vcpus memory and disk you can SSH to debug it and you can have background processes so just understand those two and you'll be good for the exam okay hey this is Andrew bathroom exam Pro and we are taking a look at containers for Google Cloud platforms so containers are a type of compute but there's so much going on here with Google that it deserves its own page so we have Google kubernetes engine so gke which is reliably efficiently and securely deploys and scales containerize applications on kubernetes you have Cloud build so continuously build test and deploy containers using the cloud Google Cloud infrastructure you have artifact registry so store managed and secure container images and language packages you have container registry so store manage and secure your Docker containers images these sound really similar and that's because this version this is actually the second version of container registry so both of them exist but generally it's recommended always to use artifact registry okay you're not going to probably see that like them lined up against each other but just so you know the benefits always towards artifact industry over container registry okay if you want to use a virtual machine like a compute engine you can pretty much just check box it on and now you have a container optimized OS so it's really easy to use containers even with compute engine which is nice you have Cloud run which is a stateless container fully managed environments and you can also use it with anthos so this one and I really should have highlighted this in yellow here but stainless containers is something you want to remember for your exam they also have containers for the AI platform deep learning so this is when you'd be using vertex AI you might need to have a bunch of tooling around that and then there's also the Google marketplace for kubernetes application so you can so if you're using kubernetes and you just need something that's already prebuilt and you're willing to pay there's just some free stuff in there you can go there and get them okay foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at kubernetes which is an open source container orchestration system for automating deployment scaling and management of containers it's originally created by Google and now maintained by the cloud native Computing Foundation also known as cncf what's interesting is this Foundation also has their own certifications like the certified kubernetes administrator and the certified kubernetes developers so don't be surprised if you see me making courses for that in the future kubernetes is commonly called K8 the idea here is that the 8 represents the remaining letters so u b e r n e t the advantage of kubernetes over something like Docker and you've probably heard of Docker for containers before but it has the ability to run containers distributed across multiple VMS that's what kubernetes can do that Docker cannot do on its own a unique component of kubernetes are pods a pod is a group of one or more containers with shared storage network resources and other shared settings that is kind of the special kind of infrastructure or architecture that kubernetes has kubernetes is is ideal for micro service architectures where companies have tens to hundreds I really should have highlighted that in red for you tens to hundreds of services they need to manage if you don't have an I didn't say containers I said Services because that could be there's even more containers than uh tens to hundreds you know what I mean there could be thousands but the idea here is that kubernetes does add a lot of management layer to it but the idea here is that uh you know when you have a lot of services it is the best choice okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at databases for the Google Cloud platform and the First on our list is bigquery and this one is a big deal because not only is it a data warehouse It's a serverless data warehouse and the reason why that is important is because traditionally uh data warehouses are extremely expensive but this one because it's serverless that means it can scale to zero and uh it's uh you know only when you're using it do you pay for it okay and so that is a very unique Cloud offering Azure says they have kind of a serverless data warehouse it's totally not true the only one that has it is Google and so it's a big deal okay and it's definitely going to show up more in this course and it will absolutely be on the exam okay so um it can store terabytes or petabytes of data using nosql it is a wide column database service and it also has builtin ml which will visit later on okay then there's Cloud spanner this is a fully managed relational database this is not postgres this is not MySQL it is a proprietary relational database designed by Google for scale it has your SQL so you'd have to do a tiny bit of translation if you already have an existing database but the idea is that if you want something that scales like crazy then this is the service for you if you're using relational databases you've got Cloud bigtable this is a no SQL key value store it is a fully managed nosql database for large analytic analytics and operational workloads so that's there we have Cloud SQL and this is a relational database service so if you're using MySQL postgres SQL Server it's just a managed service to host them there then you have fire storage the nosql document database it adds a nosql document database to mobile and web apps it can get kind of confusing because there's another service called Firebase which we cover in this course and it has Firebase firestore but it's the same underlying service okay this one is very similar to mongodb it's not mongodb it's a proprietary service by Google but one of its key features is that it has a realtime component to store and sync data in real time and that is a very big deal and that particular note there you want to remember because that will show up on the exam if someone's asking for a database and there's a realtime component it's going to be firestore okay you got memory story this is not going to show up an exam but it's an inmemory database to achieve Extreme Performance using a managed inmemory data store service so think of redis that is basically what this is and then last on our list here we have database migration service DMS this is a serverless easily minimal downtime migration to Cloud SQL okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are taking a look at databases so a database is a data store that stores semistructured and structured data and a database is more complex data store because it requires using formal design and modeling techniques databases can be generally categorized as either a relational database so structured data that strongly represents tabular data such as tables rows and columns that means it could either be row oriented or column oriented or nonrelational databases semistructured data that may or may not distantly resemble tabular data and so the way these things work is you'll generally have a specialized language to query in such as SQL a specialized modeling strategy to optimize retrieval for different use cases more finetuned control over the transformation of the data into useful data structures of reports and normally when we just say database we're generally referring to relational row oriented data stores so I think MySQL postgres msql okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're looking at the concept of a data warehouse so a it's basically a relational data store or database designed for analytical workloads which is generally column oriented okay so companies will have terabytes or millions of rows of data and they need a fast way to be able to produce analytical reports data warehouses generally perform aggregation so aggregation is grouping data so like finding a total of average data warehouses are optimized around columns since they need to quickly aggregate column data and so data warehouses are generally designed to be hot hot means that they can return queries very fast even though they have vast amounts of data data warehouses are infrequently accessed meaning that they aren't intended for realtime reporting but maybe once or twice a day or once a week to generate business generate business or user reports a data warehouse needs to consume data from a relational database on a regular basis so that's all we're kind of seeing over here where imagine that this is our data warehouse and we want to generate a report the idea is that we're either ingesting data from SQL or if we're ingesting data from a nonuh tabular like structure we have to use ETL so to transform the data into the format that we want okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at a key value store so key value databases or data stores is a type of nonrelational database nosql that uses a simple key Value method to store data and the way I like to describe them is that they're dumb and fast and they generally lack features like relationships indexes aggregation transactions you name it they don't have it but what they do have is speed okay so a key and Value store is a is a unique key alongside a value and the idea here is that a simple key and Value Store will interpret this data resembling something that looks like a dictionary so an associative array or a hash and so when we look at it kind of like a table it can resemble tabular data but it does not have consistent columns per row hence it's called schema list because it doesn't follow a particular scheme due to the simple design they can scale well beyond a relational database and key value stores are generally the ones that are the most scalable but the idea is that because of the simplicity of these things usually you are you know like these are really great for like leaderboards where the data is exactly stored the way you want to see it okay so if you have to do joins or data manipulation then these are not going to be of your ideal but the data is exactly as you needed to see it then they work really well okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at document stores so a document store or document database is a nosql database that stores documents as its primary data structure so a document could be XML but it's more commonly Json or jsonlike documents are a sub class of key value stores the the main difference is that they can store nested dictionaries nested hashes okay the cut the components of a document store compares to relational databases the easiest way to explain it so where you would have tables they call them collections where you'd have rows that call them documents where you have columns they call them Fields indexes are the same and you do have some ability to do joining via embedding and linking so you know you can leverage that tabular data to kind of think about how document stores are but fundamentally they're not tabular data okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at serverless services for Google Cloud platforms so what is serverless well serverless architecture or fully managed services that automatically scale are highly available durable secure by default abstracts away the underlying infrastructure and are built based on the execution of your business task so the idea here is you pay for the value you don't pay for idle servers and serverless can scale to zero meaning when not in use the services don't generally cost anything so let's look at Cloud functions this is functions as a service when we're talking about serverless on any CSP this is what people look at first is what is the serverless functions okay and so you choose a runtime upload single function code so they're not full web apps just parts of code and they're intended to be shortlived and everything else is taken care of for you you have Cloud run this is for serverless containers so run stateless containers on a fully managed environment or via anthos you have app engine platform as a service so build and deploy apps using traditional web Frameworks and all the underlying infrastructures taken care for you platform as a service is not always serverless but app engine specifically has a serverless offering which is the standard version you have event Arc and this is a serverless event bus so you build event driven solutions by asynchronously delivering events from Google services SAS and your own apps used for application integration AWS is one is called eventbridge so it's the same thing there so the idea is it's application integration for Google services and other third parties okay you have K native this is serverless K8 containers deploy managed serverless Cloud native applications for kubernetes you have workflows this is a serverless state machine so orchestrate and automate Google cloud and HTTP based API services with serverless workflows you got bigquery serverless data warehouse understand your data using a fully managed highly scalable data warehouse with builtin ml then you have cloud storage this is serverless storage so it's an object store and the idea is that this stuff is highly available it's distributed across multiple data centers you just upload files you don't think about anything like about the disks or anything else okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're looking at storage for Google Cloud platforms so we've got cloud storage persistent disk and file store uh there is cloud source for Firebase that's not going to show up on your exam but let's dive into these three uh really quickly of both their architecture and why they would be used in certain circumstances so for persistent disk the idea here is that it's using blocks as a means of storage so it has a virtual disk and it stores things just like you would on a regular disk the idea here is that you have direct access to the operating system and it supports only a single right volume all right we'll talk about the use cases at the end of going through these three architectures then we have file store which is a file share so the file is stored with the data and metadata we have multiple connections via the network share supports multiple reads but for rights they're going to get locked when someone's writing okay then you have uh cloud storage which is for object or blob storage so data is stored as objects so so there's metadata a unique ID it scales with limited next to no upper limit in terms of the storage it supports multiple reads and writes so there are no locks in place so what would you use these things for well the first one the idea is that you would if you had a virtual machine and use a volume you could attach a block storage this is just basically a virtual hard drive so you could have a VM with multiple block storage or virtual hard disks but the thing is is that that virtual distance only being used by one operating system at the time the single VM okay so if you needed to have a a virtual hard disk that could be accessed by multiple virtual machines that's where you're going to be using a file share and that's what file store is or you could also just have users connect to it because it's using this NFS and SMB protocol and these are ways where you could easily Mount the drive to your Windows computer or to a virtual machine okay and so then last we have is um uh cloud storage which is an object serverless storage the idea here is that you can just upload files you don't have to choose the size of the drive the type of the drive you don't have to worry about backing up the drive or the redundancy of the drive it just works right and there's no concept of a drive it's just there's a bucket and you put everything in it the only drawback here it's not intended for high iopso input outputs reads and writes like it's pretty darn fast but the idea is that you know if you uh you know it's not going to be used as the primary drive of a virtual machine right it's going to be for accessing files okay so hopefully those three categories are clear hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are taking a look at cloud storage so cloud storage is a serverless object storage service you do not have to worry about the underlying disks right sizing availability durability the file system underneath you only pay based on the storage so the address storage and the downloads so actually accessing your requesting files files are called objects and folders are called buckets it has unlimited storage with no minimal object size probably there is an upper limit most serverless object storages do have a particular limit but theoretically it's unlimited storage worldwide accessibility and worldwide storage locations low latency so time to First byte typically 10 milliseconds has a high durability so it has nine nines of annual durability when I say 99s it's because it's 99 and Then followed by nine nines okay it has Geo redundancy if the data is stored in multiregion or dual region it has a uniform experience with cloud storage features security tool and apis and I want to cover available storage classes because these do show up on the exam this isn't something that other fundamental certifications would go this deep on but Google really wants you to know better in detail of their core services so for available storage classes we have standard and so here this is for frequent values so if you're building a web application or just general use you're going to be going with standard storage now this is the least a cost effective solution it's not expensive but there's ways to save okay you have nearline storage this is one you're going to be accessing on average a file once a month or less right it's going to be cheaper than standard storage but the key thing is once a month or less then you have cold Line storage this has a higher access cost than nearline store but a lower at Rec at rest cost so that's kind of just a bit of a tradeoff there you have archive storage this actually has no SLA um availability it's zero availability uh SLA because it's just it's offline right so a very slow retrieval very cost effective rarely or never intended to be accessed you're using these to store like um uh you know like reports or accounting information that you have an obligation to store for seven years that's when you'd be using that notice that there's this number here it says 0 30 90 365. this is the minimum storage duration it's the minimum days a file needs to remain in a storage before deleting if deleted prematurely a charge will occur so the idea is they want you to hold on to them for a particular time uh to effectively use them right because if you delete them sooner than it doesn't make sense for for you or for Google Cloud but yeah I just want to emphasize that available storage classes will be on the exam and they showed up more than once for me so definitely know the difference okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at networking for the Google Cloud platform so the most important service to talk about is virtual private Cloud VPC it is a logically isolated section of the Google Cloud Network where you can launch Google Cloud resources and the idea is you know once you have your slice of the network the amount of resources you can launch is based on how many available IP addresses and that's determined by cider range so cider range or cider notation is a a format that looks kind of like an IP address it has this forward slash thing on the end here and that is what's determining how many available IP addresses are if you have 65 000 that means you can launch pretty much 65 000 virtual machines you don't ever just launch something into a VPC you'll launch it into a a subnet of a VPC a subnet is a subdivision of the virtual private cloud and the way that works is that you would actually have to choose a cider range as well that side of range is going to be smaller than the the the VPC one interestingly enough the larger the number is the smaller the IP range is that's just how the math works you don't need it for to need to know for the exam but I like to cover this stuff anyway because it's fundamental information we have public subnets and private subnets public subnets can reach the internet private subnets can't reach the internet now there is no a hard rule about that like there's no constraint that is just like you don't say create a private subnet you just create a subnet and if you don't want uh you if you want to treat it as a private submit just don't give them any external or public IP addresses so here I have a little diagram I made here for you just to kind of explain some of the components this is not an exhaustive one networking has so many features here um it just got too complicated so we just have a very simple example here so here we have our VPC a VPC has to be launched within a region so here it is in US West one we have a public and private subnet these would be launch in particular zones that's how you get multizone so you create a subnet across a one subnet per zone so you have three zones and that way you'd be highly available we have uh compute engines these are virtual machines running here so if we wanted a virtual machine in our public subnet to reach the internet it has to have an external IP address it would also communicate through internet gateway in Google Cloud you don't have to create an internet gateway like AWS it's just there there's already a route set for it so that's really nice you don't have to think about that for a private subnet if it has to go out to the internet not internet coming in you'd have to use a network address translation so cloudnat that's pretty standard across all the cloud service providers if you're trying to get traffic into a virtual machine studying a private subnet that is where you'd need some kind of hybrid connection so a cloud VPN or Cloud interconnect you'd probably be using both of these in combination that's usually how it goes or just the cloud VPN but but that basically establishes a private connection to this VPC and it's it's private subnet and that way you could just treat it as the same network the way you're going to protect your your resources is via a firewall rules firewall rules are at the instance level and they're also stateful so you can say allow or deny which is when you again if you're in AWS it's totally different right you have um you have uh different controls for that okay but yeah that's generally the main components there okay foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at more networking services for the Google Cloud platform now these are just basically auxiliary services not all of them you really need to know in detail for the exam but you should know them in general uh because and they can kind of help you out so let's go through them all so we have Cloud armor this helps protect against DDOS and web attacks we're going to cover that later again this one could show up on your exam Cloud load balancing is just a load balancer a high performance load balancer we have Cloud CDN so this is a Content distribution Network it caches your data globally so that you know your websites load fast stuff like that cloud Nats provision applications without public IP addresses allows web apps to communicate in private subnets out to the internet to download things like packages or software updates things like that cloud DNS publish and manage your domain names using uh Google's reliable resistant low latency DNS service traffic director it is a global load balancer this is this has to do with like service mesh enough Cloud interconnect so connect your infrastructure to Google Cloud on on your terms from anywhere Cloud VPN securely extend your onpremise network to Google's Network through ipsec VPN tunnel that's how you get a secure connection from your uh on premise to your your network Google Cloud Network Cloud router dynamically changed routes between your Google Cloud virtual VPC Network and your onpremise networks using BPG so that's just a component you need to do a hybrid connection and then we have some auxiliary services like very auxiliary services for just kind of like monitoring things like that so Network Intelligence Center a single console for comprehensive network monitoring verification optimization Network Telemetry traffic track Network flows for monitoring forensics realtime uh security analysis expense optimization network service tiers optimize your network for performance or cost so for your exam um you know Cloud VPN Cloud interconnect Cloud armor and that's about it okay now they talk about they say like they're supposed to be things like uh sdwan and and service mesh I never saw those on the exam so these are the real Three that you need to know but these are all the other things that are involved okay Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we still got one part left with networking these are just kind of like features of VPC that um I just want you to know they're not core to any questions on the exam but they might show up as choices and so it'll help you eliminate them as the wrong answer okay so we have private Google Cloud this allows your instances to reach Google apis and services using an internal IP rather than a public IP address so uh you know sometimes services are publicly accessible uh maybe like firestore or something like that or bigquery as the idea is you want them to stay in the network right because you're paying outbound or egress costs or you're concerned about security and so having private Google Cloud turned on is a good idea that doesn't necessarily mean that your subnets a private subnet because you turn this on it just means that when it communicates with Google services it's going to use a private IP address for shared vpcs this is a way of sharing subnets with their projects so connect resources from multiple projects to a common VPC this sounds like VPC c network peering it's more like a convenience feature where you're not doing it the networking level it's more at the project level so it confuses me a bit but you know I get it there's VPC networking peering so private connect to VPC networks which can reduce latency costs and increase security so VPC peering is common in all cloud service providers uh yeah just joining those vpcs together serverless VPC access allowed Cloud functions Cloud run Services app engine standard environments apps to access resources in a VPC network using those private IP addresses I wonder if you have to have private Google Cloud turned on for that but it sounds like the other way so private Google cloud is like my machine connecting with other Google cloud services and serverless VPC accesses just services that are generally public facing where you access them over public IP address access things via the private Network okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at internal services for the Google Cloud platform so these are services that you generally cannot use and they're and they're designed to be uh supportive of all the underlying infrastructure for many Google cloud services I just want to get you exposed to these because they might show up as twice as as distractors on your exam and you might see them in the documentation with no context and so you just might wonder what these things are so that's why we're going to cover them and the first one actually is an exception where you can use this service but it's spanner and so spanner without the word cloud is the internal service globally consistent scalable relational database and then Google made this available to us as Cloud spanner then you have Borg it's a cluster management manager that runs hundreds of or thousands of jobs from many thousands of different applications across a number of clusters each with up to tens of thousands of machines Borg I think is inspired by Star Trek right the Borg we have chubby a distributed lock manager dlm as a service that temporarily prevents files and records from being used by another user or operation on a virtual machine and then you have Colossus cluster level file system successor to the Google file system GFS provides the underlying infrastructure for the Google Cloud Storage service from firestore to Cloud SQL to to uh to firestore again I suppose and to cloud storage I guess I was trying to write something else there but that's okay but there we go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're looking at what is apogee so apogee Corporation was an API management and Predictive Analytics software provider before it's merger into Google Cloud so apogee is a founding member of the open API initiative so that's what we're talking about open API 3.0 specification originally known as the Swagger specification so open API specification is an open source standard for writing declarative structure of an application program interface API and can either be written in either Json or yaml format so here it is uh but what what they're talking about here is that there's things called API gateways and API gateways is a hosted version of an API and that and if you're familiar with apis the idea is you can Define endpoints you can say I want a route to users and it's a get and the idea is I want to send it to somewhere I want to send it to this Lambda to this virtual machine or whatever okay okay csps will have fully managed API Services known as API Gateway these API graduates generally support open API standards so you can quickly import or export apis so like on AWS you can use open API 3.0 or Swagger which is 2.0 same thing with gcp same thing with Azure they all have these things okay but in particular Google has apogee okay and so their apogee Services were blended into Google Cloud platform okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at API management so API management is where you have API gateways uh that are basically hosted API endpoints that access Google Cloud resources we got a couple of options here we have the apogee API platform this is an API Gateway develop secure deploy monitor apis everywhere expensive but has many features then you have Cloud endpoints this is also an API Gateway develop deploy manage apis of Google Cloud cheap and simple good Integrations with app engines and other services I don't know if Cloud endpoint came before apogee but I mean I can understand why there's two offerings here you know they acquired a company that had an API Gateway and then they just wanted a cheaper one that's more like serverless kind of offering on the right hand side so but we'll look at what apigee does because it does a ton so we have API analytics we have API monetization where you can actually people pay to access particular resources via the API apogee sends so ad intelligent Behavior detection to protect guys from Attack apogee hybrids a manage API on premise on Google cloud or in a hybrid environment so you can use your apis outside of Google Cloud which is cool Cloud Healthcare API help secure apis that a power actionable Healthcare insights I think that last one is on the apogee side for cloud endpoints now doesn't sound like it does much but it has one really cool thing which is a developer portal so the idea is that once you've created your API you can press a button and it takes about 10 minutes what I'll do is it'll spin up a a website or web app that allows you to explore the API and that's really useful if you're just like looking for documentation or you want to interact with the API for the developers on your team and I really like that feature so there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at data analytics services for the Google Cloud platform so the number one here is bigquery understand your data using fully managed highly scalable data warehouse with builtin machine learning you've got Cloud composer create schedule Monitor and manage workflows using a fully managed orchestration service built on top of Apache airflow you've got data flow develop realtime batch and stream data processing pipelines it is using Apache beam in this case cloud data Fusion so quickly build and manage data pipelines using fully managed codefree data Integrations with a graphical interface you have data prep by trifacta so explore clean and prepare data for analysis dataproc perform batch processing querying streaming using a manage Apache Spock Hadoop service you've got Google data Studio tell great stories to support Better Business decisions Pub sub ingest event streams from anywhere at scale data catalog discover and understand your data using a fully managed scalable data Discovery and metadata managed service Cloud Life Sciences process analyze and annotate genomic and biomedical data at scale using containerized workflows for the exam you want to know the difference between data flow and data proc because these will come up like side by side and choices and they seem very similar because they do the same thing actually these three all do the same thing they're etls they take data and they they do batch Transformations on them or streaming on them but this one here dataproc is when you want to use Hadoop it is it is uh then you have data flow and this one is more of a fully managed service and then cloud data Fusion this is where you actually have a graphical user interface and it's code free all right so you know if you understand the difference between those three services you're going to get yourself some extra points there on the exam other than bigquery nothing else really showed up here just those three okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro we're looking at dataproc versus dataflow versus cloud data Fusion because I said these three are important to know the difference between so dataproc is for open source pipelines that can use Apache spark Apache Hadoop service it's for batch processing querying streaming uh you know when I say ETL or elt this is just batch processing okay and so one of the things hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are going to make sure we know the difference between dataproc dataflow and cloud data Fusion because they're going to show up on the exam and they can get confusing okay so dataproc is for open source pipelines Apache spark Apache Hadoop so it can do uh batch processing querying and streaming and so the real Focus here is really on spark because spark is known to be the fastest tool I think it's like 50 times faster 100 times faster than standard Hadoop jobs and just overall super super fast extremely popular so you know that is the reason why you'd go with dataproc because you're using Apache a spark or Hadoop the downside here is there's more management to be involved here some of it's abstracted away but not all of it then you have data flow this is a fully managed pipeline for batching and streaming okay it's powered by Apache beam which is technically open source but that is not an open source tool for actually doing the batching and stuff it's to manage the pipeline okay so if you need a fully managed service that's what you're going to use then you have cloud data Fusion this is a a way of visually building pipelines it's no code Enterprise solution for building etel pipelines via drag and drop interface I don't think you can use this for streaming it has 150 plus preconfigured connectors and Transformations so you just drag and drop stuff you just run it and as it's consumed that's what it does if you're using Azure this is the same thing thing is similar to Azure data Factory or AWS this is similar as glue okay um you know again I don't think it does streaming but I think that cloud data Fusion probably would have the highest price point for best performance you would be using dataproc for the least amount of headaches but still doing things pragmatically you'd be using data flow okay so those are the three and remember them okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at developer tools now these aren't really going to show up on the exam or if they are we've already covered them the most important ones but I just wanted to go over these just so that you had a full scope just for your own knowledge of things that are here I couldn't even be bothered to even pull out icons for this one but let's get through it here because I think that you know you might be able to take something away from this that you might use in your own development workflow okay so you have artifact registry so this is restoring containers you have the cloud SDK we covered that earlier this is a package to interface with the command line interface or chromatically write code in your code you have container registry this is the older form of storing containers recommended to use artifact registry nowadays you have a code or Cloud code man that's a hard one to say extend your IDE with tools to write debug deploy kubernetes application so it's just um probably I think you install that with Visual Studio code but it's just stuff around burnettis Cloud builds so we looked at this in our in our container section this is for running containers for build environments Cloud Source repositories so manage code and extend your git workflow by connecting Cloud build app engine stuff like that it's just a way of connecting uh git repos to various Services Cloud scheduler scheduled batch jobs big data jobs Cloud infrastructure operations using a fully managed Cron job service if you use database that's cloudwatch right Cloud tasks asynchronously execute dispatch delivered distributed tasks when you're working with Cloud functions you're going to be working with Cloud tasks Cloud code for IntelliJ so debug production Cloud apps inside IntelliJ okay tools for Powershell so you can work with Powershell with Google they got tools for visual studio code Eclipse app engine plugins a maven app engine plugin so it's all for Java there the Gradle and the maven Firebase test lab so test your mobile apps from a variety of devices and device configurations that one I'm interested in checking out Firebase crash analytics but these are all within Firebase so that's the only issue there so get a clear actionable insights into your app issues techton so create CID style pipelines using kubernetes native building blocks workflows orchestrate and automate Cloud Google Cloud HTTP Based Services that's a serverless state machine event Arc uh build event driven solutions by asynchronously delivering events from Google services that is just a service event bus so a lot of these we've already covered but just just wanted to show you some of these tools because maybe you use one of these Ides and you just want oh okay I'm gonna go check this out I use Eclipse that'd be cool you know hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're looking at hybrid and multicloud services for Google Cloud now it seems like we're reiterating over the same Services again and again in different ways and that is on purpose because I want you to know these services so you can remember them for the exam so let's get to it the first is antho so modernize existing apps build web apps build high in hybrid and multicloud environments when enabling consistency between onpremise and Cloud environments remember anthos allows you to extend your control plane to not only other multi or other cloud service providers but also onpremise can do compute and kubernetes you have anthos deployed on VMware so modernize existing apps and build new apps on your VM environments they're never going to ask you to do a VMware deployed on uh or anthos deployed on VMware but VMware can show up on the exam so you should know what that is anthos gke so that's Google kubernetes engine so deploy managing scale containerize applications on kubernetes is powered by Google Cloud this is this is just showing you that anthos handles Google kubernetes environment ethos config management automate policy and security at scale for your hybrid kubernetes deployments you have Cloud run for antho so easily leverage and the benefits of combining kubernetes and serverless apogee API management deploy secure and monitor apis everywhere remember you can use apogee in hybrid or multi multicloud okay so that is one of its advantages the Google Cloud Marketplace for anthos easily deploy containerized apps with features of prebuilt deployment templates and Consolidated billing migrate for anthos so if you're trying to move servers onto Google Cloud this is going to be specifically for containers I've seen this questions on the exam where you have to choose between my grade for anthos and migrate for compute engine and so if it's a virtual machine you're using compute engine if it's containers you're using migrate for anthos okay there's operation so aggregate metrics logs and events from your infrastructure to get signals at the speed of analysis that's under compute engine you have traffic director this is a global load balancing across clusters and config sophisticated traffic control policies for open service mesh what you really need to know is anthos because anthos is what's going to show up on the exam okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at Internet of Things So internet things are physical objects embedded with sensors software and other technologies that stream data to cloud services or other Edge devices an edge device is a device that is an entry point to a service provider Network so uh Google has exactly one offering for iot's and that's iot core securely connect and manage iot devices using a fully managed service if you're wondering what kind of things would be iots maybe you'd have something like a smart plant Health sensor video security this is a the ring device by Amazon where when people press the button to record you have conversational AI so a home assistant you know like Alexa Google home temperature control with Nest there's these iot kits this is the AWS one but Core 2 is pretty much a standard one for iot gets to start learning how to use iot and of course drones so there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at Cloud deployment manager so to understand this we need to know what infrastructure as code is so IEC is the process of managing and provisioning cloud services through machine readable definition files so yaml or Json files rather than manual configuration when you want to have governance in your Cloud you want to use IAC because it it means that it will exactly Define what there is uh and that is a really great way to keep track of exact configuration okay so for Googles it's called Cloud deployment manager so that is their IAC service you write them as yaml files and you deploy them via the cloud CLI I was a bit surprised to see that they didn't have like an upload and so I was a bit confused as to how they go do this if you search for IC for Google Cloud you'll see terraform a lot which is a thirdparty provider for some reason they just kind of like bury their own uh IAC solution but it does exist and I don't believe there's a Json format just the gamble files but there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at media and gaming services for Google Cloud what's interesting on the actual exam they'll use a gaming company as the business use case so many times but they never give you the choice of an actual gaming specific service which is a bit of a shame to me but they actually have a service called Game servers and delivers seamless multiplayer gaming experience to a global player base what this actually is it's an open source game management server called agnos that runs on kubernetes and I guess the idea here is that you're able to create Realms so if you're ever making a massively multiplayer game the idea is you can set up different regions and the idea is that uh you know like it's just gonna work really easy where players come in and say okay I'm in the U.S region or I'm in Europe and I want to connect there things like that they all have open queue so manage complex media rendering tasks using open source render manager then they have transcoder ai so convert video files and package them for Optimum delivery to web mobile connected TV that'd be for video on demand kind of stuff okay hey this is Andrew Brown from example and we are looking at the operations Suite which is just a collection of operation or monitoring services for Google Cloud so allows you to monitor log trace and profile your apps and services so the main one here is cloud monitoring provides visibility into the performance availability and overall health of the cloud powered applications you got service level monitoring so Define and measure availability performance at other service levels for cloudpowered applications for cloud logging or reporting you have Cloud logging so store search analyze Monitor and alert on log data and events from Google cloud and AWS error reporting identify and understand application errors then you have APM so you have Cloud Trace fine performance uh bottlenecks and production Cloud debugger investor investigate code behavior and production and Cloud profilers to continuously gather performance information using low impact CPUs and heat profiling Services is this stuff going to show up in the exam probably not you should just know Cloud monitoring here okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro we're going to look at a couple other products that Google has probably not going to show up an exam but you should know about them anyway one thing you can do is you can utilize Google Maps platform within the gcp so if you want to create interactive maps and interact with that API you can do that the other part is Chrome Enterprise so this is a chrome management policy to meet product productivity and security needs we might cover it in the security section it's I think you can use it alongside Beyond Corp uh but which is their zero trust model framework but yeah those are just two kind of loose ends I just wanted to throw in the course okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at Firebase so this is Google's fully managed platform for rapidly developing and deploying web and mobile apps really it's a platform as a service utilizing serverless technology Firebase offers the following services and features so uh Cloud firestore machine learning cloud functions authentication hosting cloud storage realtime database crash of Linux performance monitoring test lab app distribution Google analytics inapp messaging predictions A to B testing Cloud messaging remote config Dynamic links so Firebase is basically an alternative to using Google Cloud directly for users who want to focus on building and deploying their applications in a highly opinion framework if you ever heard of AWS amplify it's based that's the AWS uh competitor for this the only thing that I find like this service is great but I find that it's very hard to migrate off of Firebase onto Google Cloud but the idea is that you know if you just you don't really want to learn all the the infrastructure as the service stuff and you just want all the this convenience around you this thing is really great okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're looking at migration services for Google Cloud the First on our list here is the database migration service and this is when you're migrating open source relational databases into Cloud SQL didn't see this one on the exam which is kind of a surprise because I think that would be kind of an essential one it might show up in the future maybe I just didn't get any questions for that we got bigquery data transfer service this is when you're importing data into bigquery again another one I did not see on the exam then we have migrate for compute engine and migrate for anthos these are two you want to remember when you want to import from your onprem into or migrate onprem into your Google Cloud you're going to be using compute engine for VMS and for anthos you're going to be using containers you've got to remember the difference between these two because they will show up in a lineup for sure another one and this time it's for storage not compute but you have cloud storage transfer service so this is when you're migrating just general storage like data it could be from S3 it could be from RAM and then there's also transfer Appliance this is where you are transferring storage but you have so much data like terabytes of data that you need a physical drive to ship the data so these two I'm giving you extra emphasis here these two and these two are going to show up in a lineup on the exam for sure so know the difference between them okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at the types of migration for Google cloud and they Define three and the idea here this is a migration from onpremise to the cloud Okay so we've got a spectrum here the stuff that's easiest is going to be the left the stuff that's going to be the hardest is going to be the right so we have lift and shift improve and move and rip and replace so quick summaries of these three types of migration before we dive a little bit deeper into each of them for lift and shift there's little to no enough modification we're taking the least advantage of the cloud but it's going to be the fastest migration strategy for improve and move we refactor your existing app take advantage of the most of the cloud offerings slow migration process ribbon replace we're rebuilding from scratch we're taking advantage of the maximum value of the cloud offerings but it can take the longest amount of time so those are the three let's just reiterate them on with a little bit more text here to reinforce what they are okay so for lift and shift move workloads from a source environment to a Target environment with with minor or no modifications or refactoring this is going to be ideal when a workload can operate as is in the Target environment little or no business need to change for considerations you this requires the least amount of time because the amount of refactoring is kept to a minimum the team can continue to use the same set of tools and skills they were using before doesn't take full advantage of the cloud platform features such as horizontal scaling fine grain permissions highly managed services for move and improve we modernize the workload while migrating to take advantage of cloud native capabilities so this is ideal when your architecture or infrastructure of an app isn't supported in the Target environment a major update to the workload is necessary some considerations here is it takes longer than a lift and shift migration it must be refactored in order for the app to migrate there's extra time and effort as part of the life cycle of the app and it requires that you learn new skills the last one here is rip and replace so decommission an existing app and completely redesign and rewrite it as a cloud native app this is ideal when the current APP isn't meeting your goals you want to remove Legacy technical debt some considerations here is that it requires the most amount of time to develop and you it requires the most amount of time to learn okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at migration path and the reason I want to go through this stuff is not because they're going to ask questions on the exam but it's going to help you contextualize a lot of the business use case scenarios because you know this isn't like a normal fundamental certification they just make it a lot harder so you need that contextual knowledge okay so there are four phases of your migration there's assess plan deploy and optimize this is going to be text heavy but we'll work our way through it and you'll leave with some knowledge okay so for assess perform a thorough assessment and discovery of your existing environment in order to understand your app and environment inventory identify app dependencies and requirements perform total cost of ownership calculations and established app benchmarks we got plans to create the basic Cloud infrastructure for your workloads to live in and plan how you will move apps this planning includes identity management organization project structure networking sorting your apps and developing our prioritized migration strategy we got deployed so design and Implement execute compute a deployment process to move your workloads to Google Cloud you might also have to refine your Cloud infrastructure to deal with the needs optimize begin to take advantage of cloud native Technologies and capabilities to expand your business potential to things such as performance scalability Disaster Recovery cost training as well as opening the doors to machine learning AI Integrations for your app so we'll spend more time right now into each of these four phases just to kind of cement this knowledge okay phase one is is the assessment phase you gather information about the workloads you want to migrate and their current runtime environment so you're going to take an inventory build a list of your machines Hardware specifications operating systems and licenses you'll have catalog apps so build a catalog Matrix to help you organize apps into categories based on the complexity and risk in moving to Google Cloud I don't think we show it in here but the idea is if you want to see it they have an example in the Google Cloud documentation educate your organization about Google Cloud so train and certify your software Network Engineers on how the cloud works and what Google Cloud products use maybe you could use this course to do that experiment and design proof of Concepts so choose a POC and implement it calculate the toss the total cost of ownership TCO so compare your costs on Google cloud with the costs you have today use the Google Calculator choose which workloads to migrate first so identify apps with features that make them likely to be for movers all right and starting with a less complex app lowers your initial risk because later you can apply your team's new knowledge to Heart harder migration apps phase two so in the plan phase you provision and configure the uh the cloud infrastructure and services that will support your workloads on Google Cloud so establish user and service identities so for Google accounts an account that usually belongs to an individual user that interacts with Google cloud service accounts an account that usually belongs to an app or a service rather a user Google Groups a name collection of Google accounts Google workspace domains a virtual group of all the group accounts that have been created in your organization group workspace accounts it's good to know what all these things are because you know there is overlap in the course for these okay Cloud identity domains these domains are like Google workspaces but they don't have access to Google workspace applications this is one you just need and we cover Cloud identity but this is just when you need um access to Google Cloud but not to um you know the g65 or the the G Suite okay so design your resource organization so organize your resources using uh the Google resource hierarchy organizations are the root of a resource hierarchy and represent a real organization such as a company folders are an additional layer of isolation between projects that can be seen as sub organizations projects are base level organization entities and must be used to access other Google Cloud resources hierarchy architectures we have environment oriented function oriented granular access oriented we cover these in its own section because that's how important it is this one super super important for this course is understanding the stuff you'll see exam questions around resource hierarchies okay to find groups and roles for resource access so set up groups and roles to Grant the necessary access to resources design your network topology and establish connectivity so set up the network topology a connectivity from your existing environment to Google Cloud this could be be a cloud VPN peering so VPC peering Cloud interconnect okay and those three well at least the two Cloud VPN and Cloud energy are going to show up on the exam for phase three this is the deploy phase Implement a deployment process and refine it during the uh the migration so you have fully manual deploys lets you quickly experiment with the platform and tools but it is error prone and often not documented and repeatable configuration management tools abbreviated to CM so configure an environment in an automated repeatable controlled way run remote commands on VMS that check the state and remediate of an instance to the desired configuration State you have config container orchestration so consider using kubernetes so you don't have to worry about the underlying infrastructure in the deployment logic so you could use Google kubernetes engine for that deployment automation so automate the deployment process by implementing continuous integration and continuous delivery pipeline you have infrastructure as code write a script that defines resources to be created or updated in a single deployment action share and stand up entire workflows and environments easily IC tools here is Google deployment manager or hashicorp terraform and terraform is just it's an IAC but it works across all cloud service providers and it's really important to know all these different type of deploy types at the fundamental levels that can really help you on the exam okay phase four of the optimize phase start optimizing your target environment so build and train your team train your development and operations team to take full advantage of new Cloud environments monitor everything monitoring is the key to ensure that everything in your environment is working as expected Prometheus Google Cloud logging Google Cloud monitoring automate everything so manual operations are exposed to a high error risk and are also time consuming automation leads to cost and time saving savings and reduces risk so we're looking at Google Cloud composer which is using Apache airflow spin maker they're not going to ask those on the exam a codify everything so by implementing processes such as infrastructure as code policy as code make environments fully Audible and repeatable use managed Services instead of selfmanaged ones Cloud SQL automl gke app engine optimized for performance and scalability so horizontal scaling vertical scaling and you want to reduce the cost so take advantage of sustained use discounts Suds committed used contracts which sometimes are committed committed use discounts so cud so don't get too hung up on the word contract there flat rate pricing such as bigquery which I think is the only service that does that kind of flat rate pricing okay so there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at migrate for compute engine and it enables you to migrate lift and shift of your virtual machines with minor automatic modifications from your Source environment to the Google compute engine the reason we're giving this a little bit more detail is because on the exam I just saw some more questions that are kind of around the feature set of compute engine uh and so I just didn't want you get tripped up on the exam okay so continuously replicates this data from the source to VMS to Google Cloud no downtime on the source via transfer quickly clone and test a migrated VM so after it's migrated you can use test clones and make sure everything's working fine if not you can roll back I'm highlighting this one in particular because I saw it on the exam easily perform all migration tasks with Google Cloud console so just understand there's no downtime with this thing it continuously replicates and you can use test clones all right hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at anthos for Google cloud and I know I've mentioned anthos so many times but it is in the exam so that's why I want to uh show it to you from different angles so anthos is a modern application management platform used for managing hybrid architectures that span from Google Cloud to other AWS or onpremise data centers running VMware anthos is a single control plane to manage kubernetes compute in hybrid scenarios core components of anthos would be infrastructure containers cluster management it has a managed service mesh this is great for seeing where your resources are and trying to be able to Define slos service level objects to give guarantees to your customers multicluster management configuration management migration service management it's serverless secure software supply chain logging monitoring and it has a Marketplace so it is a pretty darn robust system if you're building service based architecture applications anthos is a great enabler for this with microservices but there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're looking at migrate for anthos and Google kubernetes engine normally they'll just be migrate for anthos but we just extend it with the full name here so you understand what the utility of anthos is which is for migration of containers to gke so when migrate for antos you can migrate your VMS from your supported Source platforms to Google kubernetes engine anthos anthos clusters on VMware anthos clusters on AWS so you can bring them in from a lot of different places you use autogenerated container artifacts including container images Docker files deployment yamls and persistent data volumes to deploy migrator workloads and integrate with services such as antho service mesh anthos configuration management stackdriver Cloud build for maintenance using cicd pipelines microanthus is offered at no charge and no answer subscriptions required when migrating to gke charges for other gcp services may still apply okay so the big takeaway is that you use this for migrating containers to gke and there's no cost to doing that and you don't need a subscription okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at storage transfer service which allows you to quickly import online data into cloud storage set up a repeating schedule for transferring data as well as transfer data within cloud storage from one bucket to another it's going to enable you to move or backup data to a cloud storage bucket either from other cloud storage providers or from your onpremise storage move data from one cloud storage bucket to another so that it is available to different groups of users and applications periodically move data as part of data processing pipeline or analytical workflow you can schedule onetime transfer operations or re recurring transfer operations delete existing objects in the destination bucket if they don't have a corresponding object in the source delete data source objects after transferring them schedule periodic schedule synchronization from a data source to data sync with Advanced filters based on file creation dates file names and the times of day you prefer to import data so what I want you to understand here is that you can use it for cross region application so because you can move it on a schedule from bucket to bucket that you can get data from other cloud storage providers like AWS or you can get it from on premise okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at transfer Appliance and this is a hardware Appliance you can use to securely migrate large volumes of data so migrate hundreds of terabytes up to one petabyte comes in two configurations so 100 terabytes and forty eighty terabytes imagine when they say a petabyte you just have multiple multiples of these drives that you would ship so the one on the left here would be the 480 terabyte the one on the right is the 100 terabyte you can mount transfer Appliance as an NFS volume making it easy to drag and drop files or R sync from your current Nas to the Appliance one you want to use transfer Appliance your data has to be greater than 10 terabytes that's generally when you want to do it or it would take more than a week to upload your data over the network you want to remember these last two they will absolutely help you on the exam for just features in general if they're tamper resistant so they cannot be easily open apply tamper evident tags to the shipping case they're ruggedized that means like they're just they have like an exterior case that makes them so they they're not damaged you know trusted platform module TPM chip is installed on these so they're immutable root file system and software components that haven't been tampered with it has Hardware at a testation so they validate the appliance before you can connect connect it to your device and copy data to it for other features when you're in transit it has a AES 256 encryption customer managed encryption Keys nist 888 compliant data Erasure okay for performance features all SL drives are SSD so there's no moving Parts it's very fast iops multiple network connectivity options here we got 10 gigabytes per second 40 gigabytes per second it's scalability with multiple app appliances so use multiple appliances to increase the transfer speed that's where I imagine you'd get up to a petabyte of data a globally distributed processing so ships quickly to and from the data center to Google Cloud minimal software so use common software already on your Linux or Mac or Windows system okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're looking at Ai and ml services and the most important one here is vertex AI so this is Google Cloud's unified ml platform for building ml Solutions end to end and so a lot of the stuff you're going to be doing uh when it's ml or deep learning is going to be with vertex okay so let's just kind of Define what a ml pipeline looks like so we have data Readiness feature engineering training hyper parameter tuning model serving understanding Edge so that would be like deploying to the edge like on mobile devices model monitoring and Model Management and so we're just going to break it down here into three sections and so before we get into the actual functionality of machine learning Services we need some way to actually run these models so there's Specialized or trained or run or infer but they have specialized virtual machines and containers so that's part of the deep learning environment these will be a compute that already has preinstalled on them uh the like Python and tensorflow and they might be optimized for gpus things like that now that we have our compute we need a an actual environment to build these in and the golden standard across the board for no matter what platform you're on is Jupiter notebooks and every single platform just like gcp they'll just call them like vertex notebooks but really they're Jupiter notebooks okay so now that we have an environment or a developer environment we can work on and we have our compute let's talk about the services throughout this pipeline so starting the left hand side we have data labeling this is a service that the idea is that if you want to train a supervised machine learning model it needs to have labeled data because it's going to use that to learn so the idea is that you can input uh data and then get people to help you label it okay you have data sets that is just a curation of your data that's going to be ingested into the um uh the pipeline or into the ml model or prepared for feature engineering feature store is you extracting out key data and making it uh machine readable for the ml model you have experiments this is when you are trying different iterations of the ml model so you need to remember like parameters and configurations and the history about them you have ai accelerators this is just um I think this is fractional this is fractional GPU this idea is that if you have a a virtual machine and the GPS are too expensive you can just have fractional gpus visor optimization this is a a closed closed Source service that does optimizations on your models I imagine it's for hyper tuning so we have training so that's where you are just training your model so you do like a a container or a virtual machine to do that then there's actually the prediction so that's to doing inference explainable AI so the idea is there's this big there's this big concern about the ethics or responsible ability of AI and so if you can see how it works then you can detect for bias or other unfair unfair things we have hybrid AI so I imagine that is just being able to take a model and deploy it on a phone or low end devices like on the edge closer to the the people for model model we have continuous monitoring you want to watch for things like drift or degradation because if you have a a machine learning model it can like it can get worse at predictions over time and it sounds very unusual but it's something that can happen so you want to watch out for that kind of stuff and for Model Management we can collect a bunch of metadata and I imagine that would be just for like we'd have um a model catalog like a place to store our models for easier deployment and then we want to automate this entire thing so we have pipelines this is called ml Ops it's the automation of the endtoend pipeline for building training inferring uh you know deploying a model then we have Auto ML and so this is basically automates a bunch of this away it's kind of like your platform is a service for machine learning so this can do it for vision for video for language for translation for for tables the idea is you just upload your data and then it pretty much does the rest for you it will actually run a bunch of experiments and you'll just choose which is the best one so it really makes it easy if you don't know what you're doing okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at tensorflow so tensorflow is a lowlevel deep learning machine learning framework created by the Google brain team and tensorflow is written in Python C plus plus Cuda and there are apis that allow you to use various other languages and so tensorflow is all based around this idea of a tense or so a tensor is a multidimensional array and so they call it ts.tensor in their their stuff and it's similar to a numpy ND array of objects and so TF dot tensors can reside in accelerator memory like a GPU so they're basically a new type of data structure that's just very specialized for machine learning and Google actually has created their own Hardware called a tensor Processing Unit specifically optimized for tensorflow and the tensor data structure the way you write tensorflow is in Python an example of an ml model in tensorflow is here on the left hand side technically this is kiris kiris is a high level abstraction of of tensorflow and so it can get a bit confusing initially the difference in cruise and tensorflow but they're essentially the same thing because Keras is packaged with tensorflow for the Google Cloud platform they specifically offer tensorflow enterprise so they accelerate and scale ML workloads on the cloud with compatibility tested and optimized tensorflow along with Enterprise ready services and support okay this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are talking about vertex AI again and the reason why is I just want you to understand the history of it like how it came about to avoid some confusion in the Google Cloud console so vertex AI is the unification of AI platform and the addition of automl to offer an endtoend solution for all your custom ML and DL needs so AI platform is technically uh deprecated you can still use it but it's not recommended to uh to use the platform they're always suggesting you to migrate over to vertex AI but the idea here is you would be able to prepare supervised training training with data labeling notebooks to write in document building ml models a model registry to hold all your trained models pipelines for setting up automated CI CD to rapidly deploy new changes also known as ml Ops and the other component to vertex AI is automl so easily trained high quality custom ml models you just upload your data choose what you want to predict and it does the rest okay uh and I actually had a bit of hard time finding the service I was typing like automl uh but really there's a thing uh in there which is called tables and so you could build and deploy machine learning models on structured data so you just like you'd upload the the or actually be a data sets to upload a data set and from there you say Okay I want to analyze this tabular data okay through automl hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at ML and DL environments so we're talking about the compute and the notebooks okay so to predict train tune predict for machine learning models you need to use compute optimized and specialize for ML ntl tasks so an ml compute solution will be prepackaged with specific ml Frameworks data science libraries and you'll have to make the choice between a CPU or utilizing gpus CPUs are great for classical machine learning so supervise unsupervised learning things that are math based like uh or statistics based algorithms gpus are really well suited for deep learning they're very powerful but they're also really really expensive so you got to really decide whether you really want to use gpus or not you have deep learning images and you have deep learning containers so here I'm launching up a notebook instance so a notebook instance has to utilize some kind of compute and so I believe this is a VM here that we're launching and it has a tensorflow Enterprise as the prepackaged ml framework it probably has data science libraries along with it and here it is using gpus so we have Nvidia Tesla T4 and of course there's CPUs alongside gpus but you know just use the gpus on their own there's also Cloud GPU so this adds gpus to your workloads for machine learning scientific Computing and 3D visualization why do you need this well this is fractional gpus because gpus are so expensive sometimes people just need a little bit of gpus and that's where this service kind of fulfills that costeffective gap for notebooks it's a webbased application for authoring documents that combine Live code narrative text equations visualizations a notebook makes it easy to code all the steps in ml solution while intermixing documentation it makes it easy to rerun segments of code for a fast and iterative developer experience vertex AI notebooks are powered by Jupiter Labs IDE so Jupiter is the industry standard for interactive notebooks for building ml models or for data analysis if you're already in the data sphere you know what this is if you don't you should go out there and learn it very useful so that is the IDE and then this is the Jupiter notebook okay so yeah there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at the AI Services offering for Google Cloud platform so AI is when machines mimic human behavior or can perform human tasks and AI leverages ML and DL and generally AI refers to fully managed ml SAS offerings I don't know why Google decided to call vertex AI with AI in it because it's really just for ML and and deep learning anytime we just say hi people just think fully managed Services okay but these are the fully managed services that Google offers they're not part of vertex AI so they're just outside of it but let's take a look here so we have Vision AI it derives insights from images text and more and custom or pretrained models video AI enabled powerful content Discovery engaging video experiences natural language API so derive insights from unstructured text recommendations AI so provide a catalog of Records will make suggest recommendations to users translation so dynamically translate between languages document AI natural language processing to train and simulate human review of documents Talent solution the capability to create update read update delete job postings this one is such an oddball you know I think I looked at it before but I don't fully understand it for the exam uh you know they will they might give you a lineup of vision or video AI okay so if you know what these generally do it's not really that hard to figure out here so we don't have to go very deep on these AI Services okay this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at conversational Ai and this is technology that can participate in conversations with humans so chat Bots voice assistants interactive voice recognition systems of ivrs use cases here would be online customer support accessibility HR processes Healthcare Internet of Things computer software mostly we're seeing it as the first one there online customer support So Google has really good a conversational Ai and they have a few different offerings here so we have agent assist Empower human agents with continuous support during calls by identifying intent and providing real time and stepbystep assistance you've got dialogflow so build engaging voice and textbased conversational interfaces and they have more than one offering here so they have dialogue CX so it provides an advanced agent type suitable for large or very large agents a dialog flow es so provides the standard agent type suitable for small and simple agents just some auxiliary Services here we have text to speech so convert text to Natural sounding speech using ML and speech to text to convert speech to text using power of ml I suppose the last two there should have been in our AI service lineup but we got through it will you see this stuff on the exam probably not but you should know it because it's one of Google's greatest strengths and I'm really surprised that didn't have it in the exam this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at identity and access services and also Security Services for the Google Cloud platform so the top here we have identity and access management so IEM this establishes find great identity and access management for Google Cloud resources we've got Cloud identity so easily manage user identities devices and applications from One console identity platform add Google grade identity access management to your apps Beyond Corp Enterprise a zero trust solution that enables secure access with integrated threat and data protection identity aware proxy that's always usable Beyond Corp so use identity and context to guard access to your applications and VMS manage service for Microsoft active directory active directory so this is just if you need active directory and you want it hosted on Google you can do it that way resource manager this is a hierarchical managed resources on Google Cloud security key enforcement so enforce the use of security keys to help prevent count takeovers tighten security keys to defend against account takeovers from phishing attacks these are security keys made by Google not going to show up an example they look really cool they're supposed to be really good so you check them out before we move on to the next slide I just want to give some Focus here you want to know what IAM is you want to know what cloud identity is you want to know what Beyond Corp identity aware proxy is you definitely want to know what managed service for Microsoft active directory is these are the ones that are going to show up on the exam okay move it on to security so access transparency get visibility over your cloud provider through near realtime logs binary authorization so deploy only trusted containers on kubernetes engines Cloud asset inventory so view Monitor and analyze Google cloud and anthos assets across projects and services Cloud audit logs gain visibility into who did what where when all that stuff on Google cloud cloud data loss prevention sometimes I write protection in there but it's prevention discover and redact sensitive data Cloud HSM protect cryptographic keys with a fully managed Hardware security module service Cloud Key Management Service manage encryption keys on the cloud this one is the multitenant this one is the single tenant okay security Command Center so understand your security and data attack service shielded VM so deploy hardened virtual machines on Google Cloud VPC service controls protect sensitive data in Google cloud services using security perimeters incident response management improve your incident and medium time to mitigate I'm just going to erase the ink here for a second the ones you should be focused on for this exam is cloud data loss prevention and security Command Center that's why I give them the icons here so they stand out okay so there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at user protection services and this is like stuff that would be offered via Android or via the Chrome browser right so um you know not core to Google Cloud but you should know these things anyway so you've got phishing protection so help protect your users from phishing sites recaptcha Enterprise so help protect your websites from fraudulent activity spam and abuse web risk so detect malicious URLs on your website and in client apps but I thought this one was the most interesting is that if you want this I'm not a robot thing you can get that in Google Cloud okay and put it on within your apps okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at secure by Design infrastructure for Google cloud and this isn't exactly going to show up an exam but the idea here is it's going to help you understand to what level Google takes its security seriousness okay so we have operational device security so develop and deploy infrastructure software using rigorous security practices operation teams detect and respond to threats to infrastructure from both inside and external actors 24 7 365 okay internet communication Communications over internet to public cloud service are encrypted in transit network and infrastructure have multiple layers of protection to defend our customers against denials of service attacks for identity identities and users and services are strongly authenticated access to sensitive data is protected by Advanced tools like phishing resistant security Keys storage services so data stored in the infrastructure is automatically encrypted at rest and distributed for availability reliability guards against unauthorized access and service interruptions service deployment any application that runs on our info structures deployed with security in mind we don't assume any trust between services and we we use multiple mechanisms to establish and maintain trust infrastructure was designed to be multitenant from the start Hardware infrastructure from the physical premises to the purpose built servers networking equipment and customer security chips to our Custom Security chips to the lowlevel software stack running on every machine our entire Hardware infrastructure is Google controlled secured and hardened data centers so Google data centers features layered security with custom design electronic access cards alarms vehicle access barriers perimeter fencing metal detectors Biometrics laser beams okay laser beam intrusion detection their monitor 24 7 by high resolution cameras that can detect and track Intruders only approved employees with specific roles may enter continuous availability infrastructure underpins how Google Cloud delivers services that meet our high standards for performance resilience availability correctness security design operation and delivery all play a role in making service continuously available so hopefully that makes you confident in Google's security practices but there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at compliance report manager this provides you with easy ondemand access to critical compliance resources at no additional cost really this is just downloadable PDFs that prove that gcp is compliant with various compliance and security standards so you don't have to log in to access this you just go to the compliance reports manager and it's not even in Google Cloud it's in the marketing websites and you just checkbox what you want and then you can go ahead and download that and read through it and see that they're being compliant okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are going to look at a bunch of different compliance programs that Google is meeting not the most exhaustive list but the most popular and these will be the most popular with other cloud service providers and they're good to know okay so we'll work our way through here the first here we have is the iso and IEX uh or IEC these are commonly used together because one is international standards for software another one is like when you're using physical uh or physical devices like Hardware okay so we have control implementation guidance enhanced focus on cloud security protection of personal data in the cloud uh so we're talking about personally identify information Privacy Information Management System framework so outlines controls and processes to manage data privacy and protect uh pii I know ctOS are always going for the 2701 but the numbers are there to useful to remember so 27001 27017 27018 27701 and I do actually have these memorized because I that's how frequently they come up we have systems and organization control sock and there's three layers of socks sock one sock two sock three so sock one 18 standard and standards and report on the effectiveness of internal controls at a service organization relevant to clients internal control over their financial reporting I'm not hearing people going after sock one but they're always going for sock two evaluates internal controls policies procedures that directly relate to security of a system at an organization stock 3 a report based on trust service criterias that can be freely distributed yet here 2701 a bunch and sock 2 a bunch okay PCI DSS so payment card industry data security standard a set of security standards designed to ensure all companies that accept process store and transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment you got fips so federal information processing standard 140 hyphen two so us and Canadian government standard that specifies the security requirements for cryptographic modules to protect sensitive information this one's one you're going to want to remember when you're using a clusters provider that stores cryptographic Keys they're going to be fips 142 and it's either going to be for multi10 or single tenant I think if you're doing like a cloud HSM which is a single tenant it's going to have fips 140 hyphen 3 okay which is better it's more more strong okay we got the personal health information protection act so pH IPA I'm in Ontario so this one's pretty relevant to me but it's just an example of one that's outside the standard HIPAA one okay we have HIPAA so health insurance portability accountability act this is a U.S federal law that regulates patient protected health information we have CSA so this is an independent thirdparty assessment of a cloud provider security posture uh we have uh fedramp so Federal risk and authorization Management program we spent more time with this earlier on in the course so U.S government standard size approach to security authorizations for cloud service offering so how the government works with the cloud criminal justice uh Information Services so cjis any U.S state or local agency that wants to access FBI's cjis databases required to adhere to the cjis security policy then we have the general data protections regulation gdpr so a European Privacy Law imposes new rules on government companies governments agencies nonprofits other organizations that offer good secure services to people in the European Union or collect and analyze data tied to the EU residents you want to know gdpr you want to know fedramp okay so there you go foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're going to look at privacy and transparency for Google and this is more just to communicate uh the practices they do for these things okay not necessarily going to show up your exam but something you should know at the fundamental level when you're convincing the executives why to use Google Cloud okay so Google Cloud Enterprise privacy commitments describe how we protect the privacy of Google Cloud platform and Google workspace customers so you control your data customer data is your data not Google's we only process your data according to your agreements we never use your data for targeting so we do not process your customer data to create ads profiles or improve Google ad products which it kind of feels a bit um I feel like Google's probably done it in the past but they don't do it anymore at least we are transparent about our data collection and use we're committed to transparency compliance with regulations like gdpr and privacy best practices we never sell customer data or service data we never sell customer the third parties security privacy our primary design tier for all of our products prioritizing the privacy of our customer means protecting the data you trust us with we build the strongest security Technologies into our products Google provides resources on privacy regulations such as LG ped gdpr CCPA the Australian Privacy Act my number act pipeda and a bunch more for transparency Google has trust principles you own your data not Google Google does not sell customer data third parties Google Cloud does not use customer data for advertising all customer data isn't encrypted by default we guard against Insider access to your data we never give any government entity backdoor access our privacy practices are audited against International standards so there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at Cloud armor and to understand the service we need to know what a distributed denial of service attack is a DDOS attack so a malicious attempt to disrupt normal traffic by flooding a website with large amounts of fake traffic so you got an attacker one site and a victim on the other side and the internet sits between them so what the attacker does is they use a bunch of remote machines and they issue commands to those machines and tell those machines hey go produce a bunch of spoofed data and send it over the internet and it's going to go towards the victim now the great thing is if when you're using a cloud service provider you're within their Network they generally have builtin DDOS protection now what's unusual with gcp is They Don't Really call that out very clearly but I'm sure that they have some layer of builtin DDOS protection but the service that provides you know more robust DDOS protection is going to be Cloud armor now Cloud armor is a bit different from other cloud service providers in that it does DDOS protection and it's also a web application firewall these are usually separated as two different services and other providers gcp decided to roll it into one some of its feature sets are IP based and geobased access controls support for hybrid and multicloud deployments adaptive protection detect and mitigate attacks against your Cloud load balancing workloads predefined WAFF rules to mitigate oauth's top 10 risks named IPL lists Rich rule language for web application firewalls visibility and monitoring and Cloud armor has two tiers you got the standard so pay as you go and manage Protection Plus starting at three thousand dollars a month pretty standard to see those two tier prices for DDOS protection not that standard to see these two tools rolled into one but that's just how they do it okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at private Cloud which allows you to package Google Cloud resources into service offerings that can be made available and discoverable in a catalog internally to your organization to quickly deploy governed stacks and workloads so this is what the catalog would look like the idea is that you would build different kinds of products within this catalog or workloads whatever you want to call them stacks and the idea here is uh you would apply permissions to say who in your organization is allowed to launch them and so this is a great way to stay compliant because you have these workloads that you uh your uh your developers or your engineers have made sure that are safe to be used within your organization and then it allows your departments to just um procure resources they need uh okay so there you go this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at security Command Center and this is a centralized security and risk management platform for your Google Cloud resources so there's a lot that you can do in here I don't know if you can make it out but you got threat detectors VM patching cryptographic Keys binary authorization security standards you might notice these terms as we're listing through them very very quickly so there's a lot of stuff that lives within this Command Center that you can do three things I want to highlight that could be relevant to your exam is asset Discovery and inventory so inventory and historical information about your Google Cloud resources threat detection so audits your Cloud resources for security vulnerabilities threat prevention fixed security misconfigurations with single click remediation if the exam is asking you which service has a holistic view or everything in one place to do stuff for security this is the service okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're looking at Google cloud data loss prevention so dlps detect and protect sensitive information within gcp's storage repositories so we're looking at personally identifiable information so pii so any data that can be used to identify a specific individual really great example here is of McLovin from a movie from 10 years ago he has a fake ID here but it gets the point we're talking about uh you know driver's licenses government IDs passports email address mailing address birthdays any of that kind of personal identifiable information then there is protected Health informations phis this is very similar except we're talking about the identity health information about a patient some of its features of DLP here it provides tools to classify mass tokenize and transfer sensitive data support for structured and unstructured data create dashboards and audit reports automate tagging remediation policybased findings connect DLP results into the security Command Center data catalog or export to your own security information and event management system Sim or governance tool schedule inspection jobs directly in the console UI over 120 builtin information types so info types and info types Define what sensitive information can be scanned so there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at beyondcorp for the Google Cloud so the zero trust model operates on the principle of trust no one verify everything and so the idea here is malicious actors are being able to bypass conventional access controls demonstrating traditional security measures are no longer sufficient so beyondcorp is Google's implementation of the zero trust model and it's going to allow us to do things such as single signon Access Control policies access proxies userbased authentication device based authentication authorization and by shifting access controls from the network perimeter to individual users beyondcorp enables secure work from virtually any location without the need of a traditional VPN so the principles here for Beyond Corp are access to Services must not be determined by the network from which you connect access to Services is granted based on contextual factors from the user and their device access to Services must be authenticated authorized and encrypted okay so a zero trust model puts identity as the primary security parameter because remember we shift that over to the users away from traditional firewalls to be protected Beyond Corp is just itself is just a collection of identity access and Security Services to meet the zero trust model requirements okay so that's where it gets confusing because there's Beyond Corp Enterprise which actually is a service and beyondcorp is more of a conceptual idea of these uh identity access and Security Services okay so the idea is that we have apps and data so web apps virtual machines SAS applications infrastructure apis we're trying to restrict control access to these things to mitigate security risks right and so on the left hand side we have um user trust and device trust right then this is where we're going to be looking at their identity and their behavior for devices it's identity and the posture posture being the conditions and in which the environment they're in right so the idea is that they're going to come into the Google Network through a global front front end and this is where we're going to get context location and time so that could be extracting information like the IP the location the region the session age the time the device type things like that we're going to pass that through a rules engine and then from there we have an enforcement point where it makes further decisions before it acts as our apps and data so this is generally the idea of a zero trust model okay and this is kind of the rough outline of where beyondcorp is going to be the idea here is that we now incorporate services so here we're using Cloud identity this is for endpoint verification this is just Google's front end this isn't a service in particular this is just the Google Network okay then you have access contacts manager and then for enforcement points we have Cloud IAP Cloud IAM Cloud identity VPC service controls I've highlighted the three in yellow because to me that's really what beyondcorp is it's adding those three components into it but but basically Beyond Corp is the collection of all these Services working in this model okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're going to be looking at a few Services here that our identity but I put them in the security section to kind of group them close to Beyond Corp uh so the first is access context manager so access content manager allows Google Cloud organizations admins to Define find grade attribute based access controls for projects and resources in Google Cloud so access context manager keeps mobile forces you uh forces that are utilizing bring your own devices secure okay so you create an access policy and to determine what level of access based on attributes such as device type operating system IP address user identity and so the idea here is if it's a little bit hard to see but the idea here is that you're going to name it so I say high axis level and then I can say Okay I want to restrict to this IP range in this region you can even have device policies and additional information you'll get that output and that's the way you'll have to control it now at high or access level doesn't do much on its own we have to mix that in with a VPC service control so that's what we'll look at next hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at VPC service controls and these allow you to create a service parameter and service parameters function like a firewall for gcp apis so the idea here is you can go here and say okay this parameter is going to be just for these projects and just for these particular services and then you can even apply access levels that's where access levels come into play and you have Ingress policies and and egress policies now I just want to point out that I kept on saying the word access policies and uh Google really makes it think that you create these by yourself but they actually are automatically created for you when you create an access level service parameter or the IAP is turned on they cannot be directly managed by the customer so confusing in the documentation and I was looking for everywhere for this but I guess they're just kind of like there um but that's your Net's not going to find access controls okay hey it's Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at Cloud identity aware proxy IAP so IEP lets you establish a central authorization layer for applications accessed by https so you can use an application Level Access Control model instead of relying on a network level firewall so you can Define access policy essentially and apply them to all of your applications and resources using IAP when you want to enforce Access Control policies for applications and resources so the idea here is that you go in there they have for HBS SSH and TCP resources and so um it's only for a particular services for app engine compute engine https load balancer but what you'll do is you'll go on and say I want to enforce IAP for this particular thing and then you can open up this menu and say okay I'm going to add these people with this role for this particular service so there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at Beyond Corp Enterprise and this is a zero trust model platform uh the idea here is that you can enable it and through the Chrome browser Cloud management you can protect against threats such as malware and phishing for your Chrome users as they download and upload files uh Beyond Corp Enterprise is built into the Chrome browser with no agent required and so you might get some visuals like this saying like Okay who's at risk for which users what domains some summaries of things like that so beyond Corp Enterprise does identity and context aware access controls policies based on user identity device health contextual factors integrated threat data protection prevent data loss stop common threats realtime alerts detailed reporting support your environment Cloud onpremise hybrid access saps apps web apps Cloud resources wherever easy adoption with our agentless approach nondisruptive overlays to your existing architecture no need to install additional agents talking about Chrome right rely on Google Cloud's Global infrastructure scale reliability security of Google's networks 144 Edge locations and over 200 countries and territories so there you go that's beyond Corp Enterprise but don't get mixed up with beyondcorp which is just a collection of services this is a whole different Beast okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam prep and we are looking at the concept of a directory service so a directory service Maps the names of network resources to the network addresses and our directory service is shared information infrastructure for locating managing administrating and organizing resources such as volumes folders files printers users groups devices telephone numbers and other objects a directory service is a critical component of a networking operating system and a directory server also known as a name server is a server which provides a directory service each resource on the network is considered an object by the directory server information about our particular resource is stored as a collection of attributes associated with that resource or object so very well known directory Services would be a DNS so domain name service this is the directory service for the internet so you don't know it but you're using it right now there's Microsoft active directory this is basically the industry standard for uh most or almost all organizations in the world underneath you have Azure active directory also known as Azure ID this is a managed service on the Azure Cloud there's Apache directory server Oracle has their own there's open uh ldap Cloud identity which is Google's identity as a service provider and then you have jump Cloud which is a one that is kind of an agnostic one where you can connect a bunch of directories to it okay so there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at Cloud identity and this is identity as a service by Google Cloud that centrally manages users and groups so you get a bunch of stuff in here like user lifecycle management account security single signon Cloud directory device management reporting analytics App Management accessible through apis does a bunch of stuff and the idea here is to Confederate things between Google Cloud active directory Azure ID and many more directory Services you can manage access and compliance across all your all users in your domain you can create a cloud identity account for each of your users and groups then you can use identity access management so I am to manage access to Google Cloud resources for cloud identity account if you want to give someone access to your Google Cloud without having a Google workspace account so not having a Gmail and the g Suite this is what this is what you would do is use cloud identity so that it could just get access to just Google Cloud so there are two versions of cloud identity we have free and premium and there is a lot of features here but let's just run through it so you get the idea or the the scope of what cloud identity can do so it can handle device management and the free version we have basic mobile management directory or device inventory basic password passcode enforcement remote account wipe uh Android Apple iOS in the premium you get Advanced Mobile management Advanced passcode enforcement security policies application management Network management Remote device wipe reporting application auditing companyowned devices mobile audit MDM rules so that would be mobile device management rules okay for directories you have in the free basic directory management organizational units and groups and they're unlimited that's pretty standard in all directory Services admin managed groups groups for business Google Cloud directory sync which will give closer attention to later on admin roles and privileges Google admin app for Android Google admin app for iOS just showing you works on both admin SDK API so you can pragmatically work with the directory secure ldap for the premium we have user lifecycle management and there's no user cap on this secure ldap uh I guess it's in both so maybe we don't have to list them both there single signon and automated provisioning so for free we have a setups SSO using Google as identity provider to access preintegrated list of thirdparty saml apps set up SSO using Google as an ipd to access custom saml apps set up SSO using a thirdparty ipd with Google as a service provider for premium we have automated user provisioning for security we get user Security Management selfservice password recovery which is a great feature Azure ad also has it so I really like this twostep verification so I guess that's multifactor including security key management we have enforcement control so with security key enforcement and management password management and strength alert for premium first party session management Google security Center for reporting we get admin login saml groups token audit logs security reports saml logs app reports account active activity reports for premium you here we get device audit logs Auto export audit logs to bigquery and you get an SS or SLA of 99.9 of Premium so here you can see it does a lot you don't need to remember all the stuff for the exam but you know if you're going to take anything away from here just understand that Google Cloud directory sync is a subservice of cloud identity okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at active directory now this isn't a Google service per se but the thing is no matter what you're using no matter the cloud service provider you'll want to know active directory inside and out because it's fundamental knowledge and most Enterprises are using it and now with everyone going towards a zero trust model uh you know identity and active directory just go hand in hand okay so we're going to put some extra attention here on this one so Microsoft introduced active directory domain services in Windows 2000 to give organizations the ability to manage multiple onpremise infrastructure components and systems using a single identity per user so here's the big architectural diagram that I created so the idea is that you have your your Enterprise which is the forest here and these are made up of domains a domain is a is a means to host these different uh directory services and it's also the means to which people authorize or authenticate to your directory okay so the idea is that you can think of remains as actual servers and you're going to have to have to have redundant ones because if the main one goes down you'll want to make sure people can still log in and do their business and you might want domains that are closer to the region to which they are authenticating so things are very very fast that's why we're seeing a lot more here than just a single one okay when we look inside of a domain doesn't matter if it's a child or domain we have organizational units these are just ways of structuring maybe departments or things like that and with organizational units we have objects and so objects could be groups users printers servers devices we saw a larger list when we listed out directory service so we don't need to go through it but the idea is that it's just basically things within your network okay then we have active directory domain Services uh shortened to adds so these are the services or that consist of multiple directory Services all right I know it gets confusing because there's directory service and then there's directory services but these are services within a directory service if that makes any sense so domain Services these are the foundational foundation stone of every Windows domain Network stores information about members of The Domain including devices users verifies the credentials and defines the access rights the server running this service is called a domain can controller all right so usually when we talk about the actual server that people are calling them domain controllers all right so some of the services that can be found within active directory would be active directory L lightweight directory service so this is an implementation of ldap protocol for Azure directory domain services and we're going to definitely talk about ldap in this course we have active directory certificates services so it establishes an onpremise public key infrastructure create validate revoke public key certificates for internal uses all right we have active directory Federation services so a single signon we talk about single signon in this course too so users may use several webbased Services network resources using only one set of credentials stored at a central location we have active directory Rights Management Service this is a server server software for information Rights Management shipped with Windows Server uses encryption and a form of selective functionality denial for limiting access to documents there's a bunch of terminology for active directory I want to get you used to it so let's go through it domain is an area of a network organized by a single authentication database and an active director domain is a logical grouping of 80 objects of a network a domain controller is a server that authenticates user identities and authorizes their access to resources so this is The Logical grouping this is the actual server that does the work a domain computer is a is a computer that is registered with a central authentication database a domain computer would be an 80 object an 80 object is the basic element of an active directory of active directory such as users groups printers computers shared folders gpos Group Policy objects is a virtual collection of policy settings it controls what 80 objects you have access to organizational units is a subdivision within an active directory into which you can place users groups computers and other organizational units very common to make your departments out of OU's directory service such as active directory domain service provides the methods of storing directory data and making the data available to the network users and administrators a directory service runs on a domain controller so you know hopefully you have some kind of idea what active directory is but yeah that's the quick crash course okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at managed service for Microsoft active directory and this is just active directory hosted on the Google Cloud platform why would you want to do this when you have Cloud identity well there's just a lot of Rich features within active directory that a cloud identity doesn't have or maybe your team is used to using active directory you can use cloud identity and active director together because you can just Federate your active directory over to Club identity but traditionally active directory has always been hosted on premise however a lot of people are shifting to the cloud because you just don't have to deal with those servers anymore so there is a use case for this I think a lot of people if they're going to be using a managed active directory they're going to use Azure ad just because Azure or Microsoft is the best at it but other clusters providers such as AWS and gcp will give you a managed version of active directory so compatibility with 80 dependent apps so runs real Microsoft ad controllers uses standard active directory features so gpos remote server Administration tools virtually maintenance free so high availability High availability automatically patched configured with secure defaults protected by appropriate Network firewall rules seamless multiregion deployment so simply expand the service to additional regions while continuing to use the same managed 80 domain hybrid identity support So support your onpremise ad domain to Google Cloud deploy a standalone domain for your cloudbased workloads so there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at the concept of identity providers also known as ipds and so a system entity that creates maintains and manages identity information for principles and also provides authentication services to Applications with a federation or distributed Network a trusted provider for your user identity that lets you use authenticate to access other services identity providers could be things like Facebook Amazon Google Twitter GitHub and Linkedin so Federate identity is a method of linking a user's identity across multiple separate identity management systems and the way you're going to do this is via openid so open standard and decentralized Authentication Protocol so this is your ability to be able to log into a different social media platform using Google or Facebook account openid is all about providing who you are you have oauth 2.0 this is the Indus industry standard protocol for authorization of oauth doesn't share password data but instead uses authorization tokens to prove an identity between consumers and service providers oauth is about granting access functionality and I put these in the lineup because you know what I even get these two mixed up but they go hand in hand alright so providing who you are about granting access to functionality then you have saml so security assertion and markup language is an open source or open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization between an identity provider and a service provider an important use case for saml is single signon via the web browser and that's the reason we're bringing up saml is so that we can talk about single signon hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are taking a look here at single signon also known as SSO and this is an authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID and password to different systems and software so SSO allows it departments to administer a single identity that can access many machines and cloud services so here on the right hand side is the many things that we want to access and on the left hand side we have our directory service in this case it's Azure active directory and we have a user that wants to connect with a single username and password to all the stuff so through the saml protocol which we covered in the last slide we can do single signon to all of these services and the key thing to remember is that SSO is seamless so once the user logs into their primary directory they don't have to keep on entering their passwords in it's just going to seem like they they're already logged in when they visit these resources okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're taking a look here at lightweight directory access protocol ldap is an open vendor neutral industry standard for application protocols for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information Services over IP and networks so a common use of ldap is to provide a central place to store users and usernames and passwords ldap enables for same signon so same signon allows users to use a single ID and password but they'll have to enter it every single time they want to log in this idea is you might have an active directory server on premise and it's going to synchronize with an ldap directory so you can get access to things to like Google Cloud kubernetes Jenkins and you're noticing that I'm not listening out generic web apps these are more kind of like heavy duty workloads because that's where ldap kind of uh is used a lot okay so why use ldap when SSO is more convenient because SSO you don't have to enter your password and username every single time well the thing is SSO systems are often built on top of ldap but ldap was not designed evenly to work with web applications so you don't do single signon with ldap and a lot of times you just don't see direct integration with them so you'll see ldap more on on premise or using devops workloads like kubernetes or Jenkins so some systems only support integration with ldap and not SSO so it's just times when you have to use it okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at Google Cloud directory sync so enables administrators to synchronize users groups and other data from an active directory ldap service to their managed service for ad for Microsoft active directory within Google so it's just a synchronization service um and so this one will show up on the exam for sure so make sure you know what it is so you can choose it correctly okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are taking a look here at service level agreements also known as SLA so an SLA is a formal commitment about the expected level of service between a customer and a provider so when a service level is not met and if customer meets its obligation under SLA customers will be eligible to receive compensation so Financial or service credits you can think of them as store credits because you can use them towards uh the most uh the services provided by the CSP whether it's compute storage databases Etc but there will be sometimes exceptions so maybe like registering domains because that actually costs money okay so then you have service level indicators so slis this is a metric or measurement that indicates what measure of performance a customer is receiving at a given time a SLI metric could be uptime performance availability throughput latency error rate durability and correctness then you have slos so service level objects that is the objective that the provider has agreed to meet so slos are represented as a specific Target percentage over a period time so an example here could be availability SLA of 99.99 in a period of three months Target percentages uh that you commonly see are 99.95 99.99 99.9999999999999 and so that is not nine nines after the decimal point so we'll say nine nines of availability nine nines of durability then you have one that's for 11. so you'd say like nine elevens of durability and so the idea here is that the SLA contains slos right and these are at the service level and then the slos are based off of the slis okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're going to go through the slas for Google Cloud platform now it's in the exam guide but it doesn't really show up on the exam so uh I don't think you have to pay close attention here and this is really boring because we're just going to list out a bunch of numbers but you know maybe you'll remember some that are 95 and some that are 99 and that might help you on the exam so let's get to it so for compute engine uh and mostly I think all of these are going to be in the monthly and generally for uptime but for covered Services instances in multiple zones 99.99 single instance 99.5 percent load balancing 99.99 then what we have here is uh Cloud SQL and Cloud functions it's a monthly uptime of 99.95 for bigquery and app engines it's uh monthly uptime for 99.99 for cloud storage it's going to vary based on the type of storage but standard storage in multiregion dual region is going to be 99.95 standard storage in Regional location for cloud cloud storage near line cold line multiregion dual region is going to be 99.9 percent near a line or cold Line storage class and region location cloud storage is going to be 99.0 percent that's because of the the durability is reduced you're paying for uh like I mean like it's cold line you're not going to access it very often so it's less of a problem but that makes sense why it's lower for cloudnet this one is just the outlier where it's 99.9 percent uh and then AI platform training prediction is 99.95 it's like the one up here I should have grouped it up here but I didn't uh so for big cloud bigtable we have a bunch of different values so if it's multicluster routing so 99. triple nines if it's less than uh or fewer than three regions it's just two nines single cluster routing policies 0.9 zonal instance 0.9 for apogee uh and it's very unlikely they'll ever ask you slas for apogee on the exam but we have them here anyway so for standard 99 for Enterprise 99.9 for Enterprise Plus 99.9 percent for cloud spanner uh you have uh three nines of durability for multiregion and then we have two nines for regional instance so there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at gcp support plans so we got basic standard enhanced premium and then uh just for cost this one's free this one's 29 bucks this one's 500 and this one uh you have to contact sales so this is premium is your Enterprise support enhanced is your business support when you're looking at AWS or Azure they'll charge a hundred dollars but for some reason gcp charges five hundred dollars I think that is not smart on their part because it really makes it hard for adoption when you are a small to medium company no idea why they did that but that's just what it is okay so uh you get unlimited access to support for standard enhanced and premium they just mean like I guess to access the platform I I would think that it's unlimited across the board but that's just how they display it there for billing support that's asking billing queries you can use email phone or chat in terms of response time uh standard is uh priority two so the the larger the number the lower the priority okay priorities 0 is is the highest right so you can expect a four hour response here and enhance support you're looking at one hour response and for premium you're looking at 15 minute response times uh but I mean this varies based on this is when you actually have a severe issue so it's not for general questions okay for technical support you can only do email with standard and this is pretty common like with either Azure or AWS they'll call it the standard will be just called developer support so yeah it's just emails and you're looking at pretty much a 24hour response time for that and for technical support for enhanced and premium you got case emails and phone so that is a um I don't know if they have chat because I I didn't really want to pay for 500 to find out if they had chat but I've definitely experienced chat via billing support and it's pretty darn good but if you want to get on the phone for someone you got to be paying a lot more uh for eight out of five uh response for high impact issues uh so 8 out of five means um eight hours out of the day so your standard at five days a week so that's your standard work week 24 7. so anytime you want to ask a question uh they're gonna be able to help you out okay you only get English support and standard if you need Japanese Mandarin Chinese or Korean uh that's an enhanced support and premium support and so some of the features that are found in both enhance and premium is a active assist recommender API thirdparty support Cloud support API technical support escalation for enhanced support you get access or you can purchase additionally technical account advisor advisory service taas in premium support you get a tam so a technical account manager and so that is a person that is assigned to you you get event Management Service Opera operational Health reviews customer aware support new product previews training credits and access to purchase Mission critical services so so you can see there's a lot of stuff here in terms of the exam I didn't see a single question about like what support plan does what which I was shocked because when you do AWS and Azure you see that kind of stuff there um it's definitely on the exam guide so I don't know why I didn't see any questions and people all the other people I asked never saw those questions either maybe they'll add them in the future so it's worth knowing this page I think in terms of all these feature sets they're definitely not going to ask you them on the exam but we're going to cover them anyway all this stuff here because I think that if you are learning fundamental knowledge and you want to convince your stakeholders you know why to use gcp you want to know the full offering of support okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at active assist recommender so active assist is a portfolio of intelligent tools and capabilities to actively assist you in managing uh complexity in your Cloud operations uh so make improvements easily prevent mistakes from happening find out what went wrong quickly and so here on the right hand side is a recommendation where it's saying this is my current configuration but it's recommending that I reduce this instance to six feet pcus and 20 Gigabytes so I can save a bunch of money so three activities is making proactive improvements to your cloud with smart recommendations preventing mistakes from happening in the first place by giving better analysis helping you figure out why something went wrong by using intuitive troubleshooting tools if you use something like trusted advisor in AWS or Azure it's the same thing okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at Cloud support API and this allows you to integrate Google Cloud's customer care within your organization's CRM so the API supports create and manage support cases list create download attachments for cases list and create comments and cases and so the the cloud support API is available to customer cares with enhanced or premium support so why would you want this well if you have your own CRM right so you use a CRM to have your own cases for customers allows you to kind of centralize all of your case information in one place so that you don't have to have your users or your support team go out and make cases in Google Cloud that you can just integrate directly into a single platform and this is a very unique offering I haven't seen this on AWS I haven't seen this on Azure so this is pretty cool that gcp does this hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at thirdparty Technology support for Google Cloud support okay so which third party with hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at thirdparty Technology support uh for Google Cloud so support will assist you with integrating nongoogle services and open source technologies that are running on or integrating with Google cloud services and we got three approaches to delivering thirdparty Technology support so we have collaborative support So Google Cloud partners with other companies to create joint support experience so NetApp Cloud volumes for Google Cloud IBM power F5 Network beat bigip Dell Technologies data Stacks uh Astra data bricks so what Google is saying is that they have Partnerships with these companies and so when it comes to supporting these particular providers they can directly go to the people that make it to get you the best support for it for workload Centric support Google cloud has expertise in a variety of thirdparty Technologies and consists with the setup configuration troubleshooting of those Technologies so it's just that they're working with stuff every day all day so you know it's just they accumulate that knowledge thirdparty support So Google Cloud provides commercially reasonably assist with installation configuration and troubleshooting of thirdparty software so operating systems databases web servers devops tools SQL servers thirdparty support is available to customer care with enhance or premium support so this is really good because you know if you use Ruby on Rails Ruby on Rails isn't a Google Cloud thing but it's nice that they'll take their best effort or reroute it to someone that has domain knowledge within their support teams but there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're looking at technical account advisory service and this provides proactive guidance and reactive support to help you succeed with your Cloud Journey so uh taas delivers the following services so guided onboarding to help you get started with enhanced support and set up your operations with Google Cloud best practices and additional support for the most critical cases including proactive monitoring and guidance on case escalation monthly quarterly yearly reviews to assess your operational Health across Google cloud and deliver recommendations for improving your usage of enhanced support recommended training paths and courses tailored to your organizational needs when you purchase Tas you pay a monthly fee with a minimum oneyear contract after the first year your contract is month to month so thirdparty Technology support is available to customer care support with enhancer premium support so it's just something you can pay for additional on top of enhanced support or premium support just to get you know more guidance okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at assured support So this enables you to secure your regular workloads and accelerate your path to running compliant workloads on Google Cloud so for regulated workloads we have a Fed ramp moderate Technical Support Services U.S region and support Technical Services il4 Technical Support Services cjis Technical Support Services fedramp High technical support services so you can see there's a lot going on here so to help you meet your compliance requirements assured support ensures that your workloads are handled by Google support Personnel that possess certain attributes the supported Personnel attributes include Geographic access location us only background checks and U.S person statuses I imagine this goes along with assured workloads but I'm not too sure but uh yeah there we go foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at Mission critical services so this assess and mitigates potential service disruptions for environments that are essential to an organization and cause significant impact to operations when disrupted to prepare you for this service Google Cloud analyzes your current operations and onboards you to Mission critical operations mode a mode standardized by Google the onboarding process includes the following assessing key elements of your mission critical environment including architecture observability measurement and control delivering a gap analysis to help you prepare for Mission critical operations bringing your organization into Mission critical operation modes to drive continuous Improvement of your environment through proactive and preventive engagement after you've onboarded you've received the following Services drills testing training for Mission critical environments customercentric incident reporting proactive monitoring and case generation priority zero so P0 support case filing privileges with five minute response time War Room Incident Management impact prevention followups so you can see this is a pretty darn serious service but it's only at the the top tier of support okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at Cloud aware support so this is a service that provides you with a jump start to resolving technical issues improving your premium support experience so while onboarding your organization to premium support your tan focuses on building customer aware of support So customer care creates customer wear support by learning about and maintaining information about your architecture Partners Google Cloud projects and this information ensures that your technical support Engineers can resolve your support cases promptly and efficiently okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at operational Health reviews so this helps you measure your progress and proactively address blockers to your goals with Google Cloud so the reviews serve as a regular touch point with your Tam where you can discuss various topics related to your customer care experience including the efficiency of cloud operations including support Trends analysis of Trends and operational metrics incidents case escalations and outages tracking of open cases staff status reports of high priority Cloud projects so there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at premium support event management service for plan Peak events such as product launch major sales events and with this Service Customer Care Partners with your team to create a plan and provide guidance throughout the event so with event management service your team is supported with the following tasks so preparing your systems for key moments and heavy workloads running disaster tests to proactively resolve potential issues developing and implementing a faster path to resolution to reduce the impact of any issue that might occur so after the event your Tam works with you to review the outcomes and make recommendations for future events to initiate the event management service for an upcoming event contact your Tam but there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're looking at training credits for premium support so you'll receive training credits for Google Cloud Quick Labs we'll talk about quick labs in a moment that you can distribute to your users in your organization your Tam identifies learning opportunities and indicates which training resources can be most beneficial to your organization with this training your developers have resources to find answers quickly and test out ideas in safe environments so for a oneyear contract with premium support you get 6250 credits so just to talk a bit about quick Labs it is a platform that allows you to run Labs so the idea is that it can provision resources for you so you don't have to worry about making a mistake or getting over billed and it'll have a checklist that you can go through to do that so labs are becoming very common with cloud service provider or sorry like training providers even myself I have lab systems but this is one that is owned by Google so they used to have I mean they do they had stuff for AWS Azure gcp but now that Google's bought it it's a lot more Google focused and also they have some free stuff there there's actually ones included for this digital Cloud leader course and they're not very good none of the content is really covered in so those ones in particular aren't very good but that doesn't mean there's not a lot of great content on there so you might want to go check that out okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're looking at new product previews so for premium support customers you have access to previews of new Google Cloud products by proving a product you have an opportunity to prepare your architecture for a new solution before it becomes more broadly available to the market with your organization's goals and Minds your Tam analyzes your Google Cloud projects and usage to identify opportunities to test and use new products and solutions when your Tam identifies an opportunity they introduce you to product teams and you help you gain access to preview as you test the product your Tam also shares your feedback with the product team in addition to working with Tam you can request and manage access to previews via Cloud console in the cloud console you can check the status of your request and manage which users and organizations have access to previews having access to previews is not a big deal I mean like if you use Azure they actually make it very easy for anybody to test out previews and they're rolling that stuff out all the time for AWS you can see previews if you're part of the community Builders program it's not that hard to get in but you have to be a bit active in AWS where you get direct access to people building out the products and seeing the product so it's a bit odd that Google does it this way where it's only for their premium customers but at least they know that people that are Enterprises paying a lot of money they're going to give really good feedback so maybe it's part of their strategy and it works for them hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're looking at technical account managers also known as Tam I swear we covered this somewhere else but I don't remember where so if it's covered twice that's okay because this one is more of the textbook explanation that Google gives you and I imagine the other one was just me kind of describing tams in general so as a premium support customer you are assigned a technical account manager and also known as a tam and a technical account managers are trusted technical advisors that focus on operational rigor platform Health architectural stability for your organization so Tam support and guide you through in the following ways they can assist you with onboarding to premium support assess your Cloud maturity and works with you to create an adoption roadmap and operational operating model advises you on best practices for Google Cloud delivers frequent operational Health reviews connects you with a technical experts product managers support and Engineers works with you on support cases case escalation high priority cases your Tam will analyze the incident at find the root causes by default you'll receive eight hours per week of foundational technical account management Services if you require more assistance you can purchase additional Tam services but there you go that's the tab and only at the premium support the Enterprise level hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at Cloud buildings account which is used to define who pays for a given set of Google Cloud resources as connected to a Google payments profile so over here on the right hand side you can see that link so projects are going to be going to your billing account and then your billing account is linked to a payment profile uh if you want to see uh that you can create multiple underpayment profile you create multiple uh billing accounts so here's just a single one but it's very easy to create multiples so building account includes one or more billing contacts predefined in a payments profile Billings can have sub accounts for resellers so you can build resources to be paid by your customer so let's compare the two so that we fully understand these two offerings okay so for cloud billing account it is a cloud level resource managed in the Google Cloud console tracks all of the costs charges and usage credits incurred by the Google Cloud usage a cloud billing account can be linked to one or more projects projects usage is charged to the linked billing billing account results in a single invoice per Cloud billing account operates in a single currency defines who pays for a given set of resources is connected to a Google payments profile which includes payment instructions to find how you pay for charges has billing specific roles and permissions to control accessing and modifying billing related functions so establish I am so on the payments profile side we're over here now it is a Google level resource managed at payments.google.com connects to all of your Google services such as Google ads Google Cloud Phi phone service processes payments for all Google services not just Google Cloud stores information like names address tax ID when required legally or who is responsible for the profile stores your various payment instruments so credit cards debit cards bank accounts other payment methods will be used to buy through Google in the past functions is a document Center where you can view invoices payment history and so on controls who you can view and receive invoices of various Cloud billing accounts and products so hopefully that is clear on the exam they're not going to ask you to choose out of these at a lineup so I wouldn't worry about that it's just more for your benefit okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at billing account types so there are two types of cloud billing accounts we got selfserve or online accounts payment instrument is a credit or debit card ACH uh direct uh debit depending on the availability in each country or region costs are charged automatically to the payment instrument connected to the cloud billing account you can sign up for selfserve accounts online the documents generally for the selfserve account include statements payment receipts tax invoices that are accessible to Google Cloud console then you have invoice or offline accounts so payment instrument can be a check or wire transfer invoices are sent by mail or electronically invoices are also accessible in the cloud console as our payment receipts you must be eligible for invoice billing and you can learn more about it somewhere in the documentation so that's kind of interesting I don't know I don't remember seeing whether AWS or Azure had that but it's cool that you can do that kind of offline method for payment profile types there's two as well we got individual so uh you're using your account for your own personal payments if you register your payment profile as an individual then you can only manage the profile you won't be able to add or remove users or change permissions on the profile and then we have business you're paying on behalf of a business organization partnership or educational institution you use Google payment center to pay for play apps games Google services like Google ads Google Cloud Phi phone service a business profile allows you to add other users to a Google payment profile you manage so that more than one person can access or manage payment profiles all users added to a business profile can see the payment information on that profile so there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at charging Cycles so for selfserve Cloud billing accounts your Google Cloud chart costs are automatically charged in one of two ways so you either have monthly billing so costs are charged under regular monthly cycle or threshold building costs are charged when your account has occurred a specific amount for selfserve Cloud billing accounts your charging cycle is automatically assigned when you create the account you do not get to choose your charging cycle and you cannot change the charging cycle for invoice uh collab billing accounts your typical receive one invoice per month and the amount of time you have to pay your invoice so your payment terms is determined by the agreement you made with Google so there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're looking at Cloud billing IM roles so Cloud billing lets you control which users have administrative and cost viewing permissions for specified Resources by setting identity and access management so I am policies on the resources so to Grant or limit access to Cloud billing you can set an IM policy at the organizational level the cloud billing account level or the project level cloud billing roles in IEM include billing account creators so this creates a new selfserve online billing accounts billing account administrator manage billing account so but not be able to create them billing account users so link projects to billing accounts billing account viewers so view billing account cost information and transactions project billing manager so link and unlink the project to and from a billing account billing account cost manager so I can view and Export cost information of billing and the documentation here I've just pulled up one this is for uh Billings admin it just shows you all the permission that are possible okay so stuff I just this is basically a condensed list of all this information all these descriptions and stuff but if you want to have an idea of exactly what you have access to you can see that there okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at billing health checks and also budget alerts so Billy health checks are recommendations to avoid common billing issues so uh within your Billings overview you'll see this billing health checks and it'll say it'll either be read like saying look at these things here are some ideas and things that are good and so over if you click into that you can see a full kind of checklist the first recommendation is to go ahead and create a budget alert so this allows you to make multiple alert thresholds to reduce spending surprise is an unexpected cost overruns lots of great suggestions here but let's take a look more detail at budget alerts so you can narrow down the budget scope to specific projects or specific resources you're going to go ahead and provide a value so here I say a hundred dollars notice that it draws a trend line so you can see where your spend is currently at and you can you set multiple thresholds that preemptively warn you when you approach your budget limits so here I'm saying uh fifty dollars ninety dollars a hundred dollars this is really nice because other cloud service providers what they'll do is you'll just set a a threshold to say a single threshold which is like 20 percent and if you wanted these incremented stuff you'd have to make multiple uh uh budget alerts or or plans or whatever you want to call any other csps but it would cost you more money whereas this one is just you can just do it all in one go which is really nice so notification options so email alerts to billing admin users link monitoring email notification channels to the budget uh connect a pub sub topic to this account this budget so there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and I just want to show you how would you get to all the cool building features in Google Cloud console well you just go to billing in the drop down and from there you're gonna have a lot of options but the ones that Google wants to know and you definitely need to know these for the exam are the builtin billing reports there's four that they have in mind so there's billing reports so an interactive pricing Explorer including graph visualization cost table reports a tabular breakdown of the cost to analyze details of invoices cost breakdown report so at a glance waterfall overview of monthly charges and credit pricing report so axis SKU prices for Google cloud services here they are just notice that they're not one to one in terms of naming so that's why I highlighted these in in Black so you could just see like cost table reports is called cost table pricing reports just called pricing things like that okay foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are taking a look at the billing reports in Greater detail here so building report is to view and analyze your Google Cloud usage costs using many selectable settings and filters so configuring various views of cloud billing reports can help you answer questions like these how is my current month's Google Cloud spending trending what Google Cloud project costs the most last month what Google cloud service costs me the most what are my forecasted future costs based on historical Trends how much am I spending by the region what was the cost of resources with label X and you can also have customized report views that are savable and shareable so on the exam they actually might ask you you know like okay you want to do this right which builtin report will let you do that so you need to remember these okay and which they apply to all right hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at Cost table reports and a costal report is to access and analyze the details of your invoices and statements I know this image is really small but down below it actually shows like kind of like a summary of um costs just like an invoice you can filter that out to understand those totals and things like that so because your generated invoices and statement PDF only contains simple simplified summarized views of your cost the cost table report is available to provide invoice or statement cost details such as the following including project level cost details from your invoices and statements including tax costs broken down out by project includes additional details you might need such as IDs SKU IDs project numbers the report view is customizable and downloadable to a CSV so there you go foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at cost breakdown reports so a cost breakdown report is an at a glance waterfall overview of your monthly costs and savings so this report shows the following summarized view of monthly charges and credits the combined cost of your monthly Google Cloud usage ondemand rate calculated using nondiscounted list prices savings realized on your invoice due to negotiated price if applicable for your Google Cloud billing account savings earned on your invoice with usagebased credits broken down by credit type your invoice level charge is such as tax and adjustments so it's they call it a waterfall because it looks like a waterfall but the idea is like this is just a much clearer view than using billing reports of course you can get the same visualization with billing reports it's just an easier visualization okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at pricing reports so use the pricing table report to access SKU prices for Google cloud services including Google Cloud Google Maps platform Google workspace as of the date the report is viewed the report shows the following pricing information displays SKU prices specific to the selected Cloud billing account if your Cloud billing account has negotiated contract pricing each SKU displays the list price your contract price and your effective discount if an SKU is subject to tiered pricing each pricing tier for an SKU is listed as a separate row all the prices are shown in the currency of the selected billing account and the report view is customizable and downloadable to the csvue for offline analysis hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at the pricing overview for Google Cloud because they have a lot of different schemes for pricing and it's going to vary for service but we can break it down into seven types of pricing so we have the free trial so this is a riskfree uh trial period with specific limitations uh we have free tier these are services that have a minimum monthly limit or or of free use and then we're more now into compute so if we have on demand the standard price paid per hour minute seconds milliseconds varies per service committed use discounts a lower uh price than on demand for agreeing to one year or three year contract sustained use discounts so these are passive savings when using resources past a period of continuous use preemptable VM instances instances with deep savings but at a cost of being interrupted flat rate pricing so prefer a stable cost of queries rather than paying on demand so this is only in particular for bigquery I don't know if they provide uh plan to do it for other services we have sole tenant node pricing so dedicated compute so this is basically a single tenant virtual machine so for the exam you're going to want to know all of these pretty well uh like broadly speaking these two aren't going to show up on the exam but uh we're going to cover them anyway just for your own benefit okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at free trial and also free tier so this is going to show up on the exam but it's for your own benefit so when you sign up for Google Cloud you are going to get 90 days free for 300 of credits on the platform that you can use towards uh different types of products and services and so there are some limitations to this trial that we need to go through you cannot use these on gpus to your VM instances gpus is generally used for machine learning or deep learning you can't request a quota increase so you get 300 bucks or credits and that's all you get you can't create VM instances that are based on Windows Server images you you need to verify a credit card or other payment method to sign up and at the end of your trial to continue using Google Cloud you must upgrade to a paid Cloud billing account upgrading early will end your trial because you really are in a sandbox to keep you safe that's one of the benefits of Google Cloud where other providers like AWS you have a high chance of going over your free trial into real spend okay so for free tier all Google Cloud customers can use select Google Cloud products like compute engine cloud storage bigquery free of charge within a specified monthly usage limits when you stay within the free tier the resources are not charged against your free true credits to your Cloud billing accounts payments method after your trial ends okay so for app engine we have 28 hours per day for f instances nine hours a day for B instances one gigabyte of egress so data leaving the network like downloads the Google Cloud free tier is available only for the standard environment so it's not for flexible for artifact registry you have 0.5 gigabytes of storage per month for auto ml natural language you get 5000 units of prediction per month for auto ml tables you get six nodes hours of training and prediction for auto ml translation you get 500 000 translated characters per month for automl video intelligence you get 40 node hours for training five hours for prediction for auto ml Vision you get 40 node hours of training and online prediction one hour for batch classification prediction 15 node hours for Edge training for bigquery you get one terabytes of querying per month and to me that is like super awesome and one of the reasons why I like to use bigquery as my primary data warehouse you get 10 gigabytes of storage per month for cloud build you get 120 build minutes per day for cloud functions you get 2 million invocations per month includes both background and HTTP invocations 400 000 gigabyte seconds 200 000 or yeah 200 000 gigahertz seconds uh gigahertz is that GH said I think that's what it is seconds of compute time five gigabytes Network egress per month for cloud logging and Cloud monitoring you get free monthly logging allotment free monthly metrics allotment for natural language you get 5000 units per month for cloud run you get 2 million requests per month 360 000 gigabytes per second of memory 180 180 000 of ecpu seconds of compute time one gigabyte Network egress from uh North America per month and the free tier is available only for cloud Run Okay free access to Cloud shell uh including five gigabytes persistent disk storage so don't fear spinning up Cloud shell it's a very useful tool uh Cloud Source repository so up to five users 50 gigabytes of storage 50 gigabytes of egress for cloud Vision 1000 units per month for firestore one gigabytes storage per month um or just in general sorry not per month 50 000 reads to twenty thousand rights twenty thousand deletes per day for Google kubernetes engine no cluster management fee and that's a big one because other providers will charge you a management fee for the cluster or control plane for autopilot or its own clusters per billing account for clusters created in autopilot mode pods are billed per second CPUs memory resources requests for clusters created in standard mode each user node is charged at a standard compute engine pricing for cloud storage five gigabytes per month of regional storage so that's pretty good but only for the US regions 5000 Class A operations per month 50 000 Class B operations per month one gigabyte Network egress from North America to All Region destinations excluding China and Australia per month free tier is only available in UFC's 1 US West one U.S Central regions uses calculations are combined across those regions last page I believe of our free tier here so for Google Maps you're getting 10 gigabytes messages per month for speech to text 60 Minutes a video intelligence API 1000 units per month for work workflows 5000 internal steps per month 2000 external HTTP calls per month per compute engine one nonpreemptable F1 micro VM instance per month within us West U.S Central one U.S east one 30 gigabytes uh months hhd area hard disk drive five gigabytes months uh snap uh snapshot storage in the following regions one gigabyte Network egress your free tier F1 micro instance is limited by time not by instance so each month eligible used for F1 micro instances is free until you have used the number of hours equal to that so just remember F1 micro when you're looking for a free instance usage calculations are combined across supported regions Google Cloud free tier does not include external IP addresses um uh compute engine offers discounts for sustainable use of virtual machines your free tier does uh use doesn't factor into sustained use gpus and tpus are not included in the free tier offers you're always charged for gpus and tpus that you add VM instances and that makes sense because their physical pieces of Hardware they're really expensive okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at ondemand pricing so this is when you pay for a Google Cloud resource based on a consumptionbased Model A consumptionbased model means you only pay for what you use based on a consumption metric so that could be hourly minute seconds milliseconds can be a multiplied by configuration variables such as vcpus or memory by API calls so maybe one dollar every one thousand transactions On Demand is ideal for low cost and it's because it's low cost and flexible only pay per hour short term spiky unpredictable workloads cannot be interrupted and for firsttime apps so generally it's the one you usually use okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at committed use discounts also known as cuds and this lets you commit to a contract for deeply discounted virtual machines on the Google compute engine it's simple and flexible and requires no upfront costs ideal for workloads with predictable resources needs you purchase compute resources so vcpus memory gpus local ssds discounts apply to the aggregate number of vcpus memory gpus and local ssds with your region not affected by changes to your instance machine setup you commit for payment terms one year to three years purchase a committed use contract for a single project purchase multiple contract share across many projects by enabling shared discounts your billed monthly for the resources you purchase for the duration of the term whether or not you've actually used the service as a is it's going to happen anyway okay so 57 is most machine types and gpus and 70 is a memory optimized machine types so look here on the right hand side just to give you an idea so the idea is that when you want to do committed use you choose the product that you want you're going to choose the plan that you want the region and the commitment and then it's going to tell you your estimated savings okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at sustained used discounts also known as Suds and these are automatic discounts for running specific compute engine resources for a significant portion of the billing month so sustain use discounts apply to the following resources and this is broken into two broad categories the first is vcpus and memories when you're dealing with these two components you have General person custom and predefined machine types such as you going in and dropping down different types of machines compute optimize machine types memory optimized machine types sold tenant nodes remember that's kind of like dedicated machines and so here it's 10 Premium cost even if the vcpus and memory in those nodes are covered by the committed use discounts uh and then the other part here is that there's ones for GPU devices so you can apply Suds to gpus which is a great savings okay applied on incremental use after each reach certain usage thresholds you pay only for the number of minutes that you use an instance compute engines automatically give you uh the best price there's no reason to run an instance longer for than you need it automatically apply to the VMS created by both Google kubernetes engine and compute engine and it does not apply to VMS created using App engine's flexible environment and data flow okay but what I want to remember is that Suds is if you keep on using something you're going to save money and it's going to be particular with most CPU types most compute types and gpus okay um oh it also does not apply to E2 and A2 machine types I missed that there in the end uh so uh just to kind of give you an idea of what kind of savings you can expect so there's ones for up to 30 and that's when you're using general purpose and one predefining custom machine types memory optimized machine types shared core machine types Soul tenant nodes and so here's kind of the idea of uses level uh based on also the incremental charge okay and then we have sustained discounts for 20 so general purpose N2 and 2D predefined custom types computer optimized types and then another graph so for the exam they're not you're not going to need to know these details but you just need to know segs you save money uh when you have continued use okay foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at flat rate pricing and this is only for bigquery uh would it be ever be for any other service I don't think so but the idea here is that if you have high volume or Enterprise customers who prefer a stable monthly cost for queries rather than paying on demand price per gigabyte of data process this is where flat rate pricing comes into play so you have purchase dedicated query processing capacity measured in bigquery slots your queries are con the idea here is you consume your queries uh via this capacity and you are not built for bytes process if your capacity demands exceed your committed capacity bigquery will queue up slots and you will not be charged additional fees to enable this flat rate price uh yeah the slide doesn't want to go forward there but to enable the flat rate pricing use bigquery reservations so there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at sole tenant node pricing so a sole tenant node a single a single tenant virtual machine is physical compute engine server that is dedicated to hosting your own projects VM instance you've heard me mention sold tenant many times in this course when you create a soul tenant node your build for all of the vcpus and memory resources on the sole tenant nodes plus a sole tenancy premium which is 10 of the cost of all the underlying vcpus and memory resources it does for sustained use discounts applied to this premium but committed use to discounts do not after you create the node you can place the VM on that node and then these VMS run for no additional cost of vcpus and gigabytes of memory are charged a minimum of one minute after one minute of use Soul tenant nodes are built in one second increments the price of a node type depends on the following so number of vcpus of the node type gigabytes of memory of the node types region where you create the nodes so we'll sold tenant show up on the exam probably so just make sure you understand you don't need to remember all the details to it but remember just understand what it is and generally how expensive it is okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at the Google pricing calculator so this is a free webbased cost calculating tool to generally calculate costs of various gcp resources so you do not need a gcp account to use this tool you can create a shareable link or email the estimate to your organization or key stakeholders so this is generally what it looks like you choose the service so here I say I want two instances and there's other particular details and then it's going to generate a cost so here it's saying it's 97 you can email it you can change the currency very straightforward so there you go foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at the concept of resource hierarchy within gcp so this is kind of a graphic of what a hierarchy could look like and there's a lot of components that go into it we did cover this a little bit earlier in one slide about folders where we talked about folders projects and resources there's a lot of moving Parts here and on the exam they're definitely going to ask you about resource hierarchies so let's make sure we know this okay first thing is a resource is a service level service level resources that are used to process your workloads could be bigquery compute engine whatever uh that is a service you want to launch and you have Resource Management how you should configure and Grant access to Cloud resources from your team set up and or or team set up an organization of your account level resources you have domains primary identity of your organization to find which users should be associated with your org your universally administered policy for your users and devices linked to either a Google workspace or a cloud identity account a Google workspace or Cloud identity account can only have one org just so you know then you have orgs or organizations these are the root nodes of your Google Cloud hierarchy of resources you can Define settings permissions policies for all projects folders resources Cloud billing account is its parent organization is associated with exactly one domain using the organization you can essentially manage your Google Cloud resources and users access with proactive and reactive management then you have folders this is a logical grouping of projects and other uh or other folders folders can be used to group resources that share common IM policies you got projects so logical grouping of service level resources products can represent teams environments organizational units business departments and this is basically where resource hierarchy is very detailed in its variants basis of enabling services apis and IIA and permissions a service level resource resource can only belong to a single project you got labels so categorize and filter your resources with key value pairs if you use AWS or Azure they call these tags okay but here at gcp they call them labels great for cost tracking at a granular level there are three suggested architecturals you can use environment oriented function oriented and granular access oriented they're not going to ask you what kind of architecture it is but they're going to talk about these like saying like which would be a good setup and they'll describe kind of what the the setup would be and that's why you want to know these three types and we'll go over to the docs to look at that because that's where the most detail is for this okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're looking at environment oriented hierarchy and so this is the most simple uh simplest one to implement and pretty much what you would think that you would want to do and so the idea here is you have a single organization and you're going to break up your folders into different environments so production quality assurance and development and then underneath you're going to run your application so this works pretty well in a very simple setup but it can pose challenges if you have to deploy services that are shared by multiple environments okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're looking at function oriented hierarchy so this one looks a little bit more complicated but the idea here is that you have one organization that contains one folder per business function okay so notice here uh we have apps management and infrastructure technology and then the idea is that down below now we can Define production uh our environments as another layer of folders you have folders inside a folders so each business function folder can contain multiple environment folders multiple business functions are apps management and information technology more flexible compared to environment oriented gives you the same environment separation allows you to deploy shared services function oriented hierarchy is more complex to manage than an environment oriented and it's separate access by business so there you go hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are looking at granular access oriented hierarchy so this one's a little bit larger we have three layers of folders and so the idea here is we have one organization organization that contains folders per business unit so now as you can see here it's retail risk management Financial commercial I know it's hard to read but it's hard to fit that whole image in there each business unit can contain one folder per business function so now we have our function so application sandbox shared uh core Services data analysis controlled services and each business function folder can contain one folder per environment so production development Etc so this is the most flexible and accessible option you need to spend a greater effort to manage the structure rules and permissions um the network topology is more complex so really like when you're looking at it the idea is that we had the three three types so the first one was environment oriented so this is the environment then you had function oriented over here and then this one here is granular access oriented so the idea is that you're just adding additional folders for Organization for organizing your resources okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are doing the gcp follow along so the idea here is that we are going to uh just launch a bunch of cloud services uh it's not going to be super challenging but the idea is just to kind of help cement the uh the knowledge of what we've learned in the lecture content they don't even recommend uh necessary uh for the exam but I like to do it and I think that you'll appreciate doing it too so once you've created your GCB account you should have an organization and a default project and so one of the first things I want to show you how to do is to set up a resource hierarchy because the idea is you have your Cloud workloads below which run in projects and you can organize them into folders and this is all tied to your organization and this is a little bit tricky and it does show up in the exam so it's important to know how to do this and so that's the first thing I really want to show you so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and make our way over to IEM because that's how we do it and it's not going to work and I'm going to show you why and then we're going to show you how to I get permissions okay so we'll go to IEM and on the left hand side if you expand it down below there's one that says manage resources now you could also go up here and type in manage resources because sometimes it's really hard to find things in gcp so you just have to kind of work those two ways the idea is I have a bunch of projects in here and I have my organization and I want to go ahead and create a folder and so I might have a folder coming back over to our structure here we might want to have a folder like applications and then production so if I try application here and my organization selected notice that I have this little Caution sign says you do not have the required permissions resourcemanager.folders.create permission to create folders in this location so you go okay well how do I get permissions I would think that if I'm the owner I'd have permission to everything but that's not the case so if we make our way back to IEM all right we go all the way back here and we go we're under the top one here which is for the users and we see I have the owner role if you look up the documentation it's going to say go ahead and add project or admin folder okay so you go admin folder or project folder and nothing's going to appear and the reason why is that you can apply permissions or roles at the project level and also the organization level and because of that the the roles that are available are different so you're never going to find it at the project level here and so we got to do is go to your organization all right the way you know that you're in your org right now is that it has this little um building and notice now it's just listing uh people at the organizational level and so what I can do here is go ahead and edit the member I'm going to add a role I'm just going to type in folder okay and so now we have folder admin that's going to give me full access full control to create uh what I wanted to do there which was folders now if we go to the left hand side here and go to manage resources we should have an easier time creating folders now and so we'll go ahead here and call this application okay we'll hit create and give it a moment to create and what we'll need to do is go ahead and refresh to see that new folder and there it is so now that we have that folder let's go ahead and create a folder within that folder so I think yeah if we go ahead and hit create folder here and we'll choose our organizational structure oops uh so sorry so I gotta go and choose the org and then now what we can do is choose the folder so I want application here and following our guide here we're going to go with let's say developments because we're not serious about it running any kind of production workloads today we'll go ahead and create that okay we'll go ahead and hit refresh down below and now you can see we have application development so let's say we want to move um or let's say let's we want to create a new project that's going to sit uh in here for our development workload and So Below down below uh you might want to specify the names but what I'm going to do is create a new one in here and I'll say create project and this is just going to be my app uh and we will choose its location okay we'll hit create and it takes it doesn't take that much time for these to build so uh if we give this a hard refresh there's a refresh button up here we should now see our uh R by app so if we go back to gcp you're up the top here I should be able to switch over to my app all right and so now what we'll do is go ahead and create stuff there but that's what I just wanted to show you was the fact that you had that folders and project structure and how easy it was to create in some of those headaches there um I can't remember you probably can apply permissions at the folder level let's just go take a look I'm not running crazy workloads in um gctv so I don't always know but uh what we'll do is go back to the resource manager manage resources here and I think you can yeah I'm not sure but it's not really in the scope of this certification but the idea is we have our project set up and I will make my way back to that and now we'll start launching some resources okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are on the gcp fall Longs for the digital Cloud leader and actually before we launch any resources I probably should show you a bit about uh spend and how to control your spend so this is a new project that we started up and there's nothing really in it now I was playing around in this other sample project here called exam Pro and I purposely ran a bill so I could show you what building looks like uh because it doesn't make a lot of sense like it's very hard to understand it if there's no billing happening so the left hand side you'll go to billing all right and we'll just give it a moment to load here and so we have a bunch of different options here so reports cost tables cost breakdowns commitments etc etc uh and so for the exam you're going to want to know about um the different types of reports the overview reports cost table cost breakdown and generally understand the differences they're pretty thoroughly covered in electric content so uh you know it's not a big deal if you don't absorb it here but the idea here is we can see and this is just the overview we have our cost Trends so we have some nice charts here so it's just kind of like a breakdown so maybe top products things like that it's very straightforward but over here on the right hand side we have billing health checks and so if we were to click this here it's going to give us a bunch of suggestions that we should do and so the first is Grant access to view billing reports assign multiple billing account administrators turn off billing account Creator roll for domain set up a budgets alerts link a project or close an unused account so I would say that studying about budget alert is on our high priority here because we do not want to end up spending more than we have so if we go over to budget alerts over here you can see I have my spending limit and showing that I've spent two dollars and 43 cents out of a hundred dollars so if we wanted to go ahead and create ourselves a budget it's pretty darn easy I'll just say my second budget alert okay see I had a lot of spend the other month there and now I don't have so much um but the idea here is you can go and say okay do I want to take into account credits or not credits would be if you were given gcp credits to utilize for free a lot of times startups get those but the idea is you can go ahead and hit next then you can specify the exact amount and so I could say fifty dollars right and it shows you a line where it can go we'll hit next and this is really nice which I like you don't see this in like AWS where you actually have to set up separate building alarms but in gcp you just if you just can do it all in one go so the idea is if you want multiples you just add multiple thresholds and it's going to warn you when it approaches those numbers and if you go down below you can see that you can email receive emails about it and if you also want to push it to Pub sub you could do that so you could pragmatically code it into your platform in terms of the exam you just need to know that you can set thresholds and why you'd want to use budgets right just to make sure you're monitoring your spend now I don't need to go ahead and create one because I already have one it's a very simple process but that is budget alerts now if we go back over here to reports uh this is really cool this is basically a great way of visualizing your data so you have a bunch of different options and you can really Pare down and say okay I want to know exactly what the spend was for this uh service uh and stuff like that so if you really want to do visuals that's what you'd use that reports tab for then you have your cost table and cost table is basically like a dynamic invoice so the idea is like invoices just aren't able to show you all of the line items and so here we can go and expand and see every single uh every single charge at a granular layer and I'm pretty sure you can export this download here yeah download it as a CSV so it's a better way to um uh like uh review your bill from like an invoice perspective then you have cost breakdown and this is kind of like just a simplified report so like we have reports up here and uh and the overview but this is just more so kind of so you can see it at a glance per month so is it up is it down where are we right so not super complicated um and again the questions are not hard in the exam but really all I wanted to show you was those four there and how to set a budgeted alert and that's pretty much all we need to know so what I'm going to do is make my way back to my sample project and now we're ready to launch some resources okay foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and let's go take a look at compute engine so what I want you to do is go to the top left corner here onto our hamburger menu and we'll scroll down make our way over to compute engine and go to VM instances so this is where we would launch a virtual machine so we'll give it a moment here to load and as you can see I've never used it within this project so pretty often you'll have to go ahead hit enable so you are agreeing to use a particular service every time you create a project it's always going to show you that but we'll give it a moment to allow us to use that API it just takes a little bit of time and I don't know why sometimes the UI is a little bit buggy um sometimes it freezes like this and so if it does do that what you'll need to do is just go ahead and hit refresh it's usually pretty darn good the experience is usually pretty smooth but not always the case so I'm going to go ahead and hit enable again okay and it just does not want to work right now so if that happens and it's totally possible that can happen what I recommend is just step away go get a tea go get a coffee and come on back because it'll probably work in just a bit okay I'll see you back in a moment all right so uh after a short tea break I'm back and it's now just all of a sudden working so uh that's the thing with these large cloud service providers is that their services are so massive it's very common to run into inconsistencies in the UI where you think you've done something but it's telling you you haven't but you know you have and so you have to have confidence knowing okay I did do this and just give it a little bit of patience and time uh and just check in again and so here you can see you actually launched multiple times because I pressed the button four times so actually worked the first time but here we are and if you want a quick start you can you can hit this button here and the thing is is that gcp and only gcp does this but they have a really really good tutorial system so if you want to be shown around anything you can hit show me now uh and it'll it'll help you step through all the things that you need to know and so this one is just kind of like a tutorial on how to do something I'm not going to go through it this is more for you this is how to do a todo app with mongodb I don't like mongodb so I'm not doing that today but I just want you to know that's a great way to start learning with gcp um but what we'll do and you can see we have different instances here so VM instance templates Soul tenants those are dedicated machines machine images Etc tpus but what we want to do is just go ahead and create ourselves a regular old virtual machine so go ahead and hit create instance and we'll give it a moment here today is a slow day for gcp it's usually super fast and here we're in here and so on the left hand side we have new VM instance new VM instances from template new VM instance from machine image or the marketplace now uh I really like how gcp uh shows their um forums compared to AWS and Azure because they're always like on one screen and they're very good about showing you the price uh which is really nice uh and here you can do you get a breakdown to kind of see where the hidden costs are so it's not just the CPU cost that it's just like there is a persistent disk uh and maybe if you're using sustained you just use discount if you've used it on a monthly basis it'll show your savings notice it's like a negative so it would show you a reduced cost there but the idea here is that we want to name our instance I'm going to just say my website okay we'll see if it takes that we can add labels labels are tags so I can go here and say um EnV production we'll go ahead and add that label other provide providers call them tags for some reason gcp wants to call them labels but it's the same thing notice we can choose our region so I'm going to see if there is a Canada region I'm pretty sure there is I just started typing as if I was on Azure and that's not the case I got to scroll on down and look for it I know there's a Montreal there's always a Montreal right there at the top and so I can choose between my zones I'm going to stick with Zone a notice we have general purpose and compute optimized uh notice as soon as I want to compute optimized 135 dollars we'll make our way back E2 is I believe the most cost effective uh instances another thing that's really nice about gcp is they just have fewer fewer things to look at so it's just a lot easier to get set up here but this is good for me I don't need a two vcpus and four gigabyte memory I want to go super small so I'll click on that now I'm down to seven dollars and 83 cents I'm a lot more comfortable about comfortable with that we'll scroll on down so confidential VM Services enable the confidential Computing service on this VM so this service adds protection to your data in use by keeping memory of the VM encrypted with keys that Google doesn't have access to that sounds really good so you can see we can check box that on and we'd have some additional settings we're not going to do that today but I think that's really cool this is something I really like is that any kind of most instances I think most like basically all instances can support this container option and what it will do is it will install a container layer for you and then you can just specify your container image and it's very makes it very easy to launch containerized containerized services like single container services Azure doesn't do this AWS doesn't do this only gcp does this in this kind of convenient way so I really really like that not to say you can't do it on AWS you'd have to go to the marketplace but that is like a super bonus for me for gcp I notice there's some Advanced options here so like you know like the the command uh uh command arguments you probably specify uh environment variables maybe the entry point yeah that's the entry point there if you know anything about containers if you don't don't worry uh then you have your boot disk so this is the boot disk right and so we have some options here starts with 10 gigabytes I wouldn't want something larger than 10 GB but we'll take a look around here so here we could choose uh Debian or W9 we can change our operating system I'm pretty comfortable with Debbie and I I like Debian oh Fedora korres that's pretty cool I really like Fedora korres I just learned all about that recently you can provide your own custom images you can set the size of snapshot you can attach existing disks but we'll do stick with Debian because that's a pretty safe one there another one is pretty safe at Centos that's what a lot of the cloud service providers base there they're managed instances on but what we'll do is scroll on down you can see we can apply firewall stuff um yeah that's all fine we don't need to do any more without we don't need a firewall so we'll scroll up make sure our price is okay 7.83 you know what I'm looking for is um a lot of times cloud service providers will have a startup script here it is and this would be cloud and knit okay so Cloud init is a pretty standardized or CF internet cloud in it can't remember what it's called but it's a standardized way of uh providing your um your virtual machines with a script to start like it's the first thing it runs so if we wanted to install Apache we could do that um I'm just trying to see if there's like an example here like it's just a bash script right so I'm just thinking yeah see it here yeah this is actually exactly what I want too so this is perfect I didn't know they had this and so here the idea is that we'll just take this if you specify the first line in a cloud init file as this with the shebang it's going to know it's a basket but it can also take a yaml file I believe um but anyway what this will do is it will install it will do an update and then it will install Apache 2 and I believe these this is actually for Debian uh because if we were using um Centos it'd be like yum but apt is for that I don't know if it needs a pseudo in front of here it doesn't seem to need it but what we'll do is we'll put that in there save me a lot of time I didn't have to try to remember what to write um you can set custom metadata we don't need to set any custom metadata today and just looking some other stuff availability policy on host maintenance nope everything is fine so we'll go ahead and hit create and fingers crossed that just work uh I didn't set up any SSH though huh well if if there's options what we'll do is we'll just launch another one but we'll see how this one goes so what we'll have to do is wait a little while so I just hit refresh up here so there's the connect option for SSH but we're just waiting for it to start it's just going to spin so um let's give it five ten minutes and I'll see you back here in a moment okay okay so after waiting a little bit of time there I did have to hit the refresh button in order to see that green status but let's see if our website works so what we can do is go over to this external IP that is our public facing IP address hit that button to copy it and we'll go ahead and paste that on in there and so notice that it's not resolving if that's happening it's either means two things our Apache server is not running or our fire firewall rules is not allowing us to access on Port 80. so that is something we're going to need to figure out so we need to ssh in I'm so used to providing an SSH key or generating during the creation process I forgot the gcp doesn't make you a set one in the creation process you can just click here and it'll let you in so we can open browser in window on a custom port view gcloud command I kind of would prefer to do it in um the Google shell so let's just try the browser first okay and what it will do is we'll transfer the SSH keys to the VM so you don't have to do anything it's really easy to get in okay and we'll just give it a moment not fast but easy all right and we're in okay so we could type in LS PWD just to see where we are let's go to see the gcloud command if that doesn't work we'll just make our way back here but I would rather I would like to try to use the cloud shell because I think that's really nice we'll go view gcloud command and there it is so what we'll do I'm not sure if this is going to work but what we'll do is copy this the following can be used in the SSH into the instance okay so oh running Cloud shell perfect so if we didn't click there we could go up here and click activate Cloud shell Cloud shell is like a a terminal I think gcp was the first to have this Azure has one AWS now has one but gcp has the best experience for this but what we'll do is we'll go down here and say view in gcloud and just hit run in Cloud shell okay gcloud is the name of the um the CLI okay and we'll give it a moment to start up an instance here I assume it's containerized it's probably it's probably containers it's how so it's able to launch so fast usually it's super fast by the way it's not super fast today and it'll run that gcloud command it should get us into our instance also another cool thing about gcloud is it has a editor built in and it looks just like vs code I'm not going to switch over to it because I do not want to interrupt our terminal but if you want to do coding you can totally do it within the gcp platform and again that's a lot easier than the other ones make it out to be so it's prefilled it in here it looks like this is a beta feature but we'll go ahead and hit enter uh it's requesting access we'll say authorized we will say yes we'll say enter enter so what it is is it generated out in SSH key for the cloud shell and then I imagine what it's going to do is then um take that SSH key move it on to the server and then allow us to then authenticate that way okay and so I believe yes we are in the instance because it says my website down below so I'll type in clear okay and so one way we could tell if it's working is we could uh we could do like a curl so if we did curl localhost and it returns HTML and it does that shows us that the Apache server is running probably could also type in sudo Apache um or maybe pseudo service um Apache to status yeah and it's running so so it's running and we we did a query so probably the issue has to do with the fact that our firewall's not open so let's go take a look there and see what we can do okay so we need to go create ourselves a firewall rule but I just remembered that we're going to need the IP address so I'm just clicking back to the instance here whenever this page loads I'm going to grab that external IP address and click back forward here we'll go ahead and create ourselves a new rule I'm just going to scroll on down and change this over to specify or all it's just all instances in the network and then specify the range and put forward slash 32 on the end there okay so the top here we're going to type in Port 80. and we'll maybe say website and we'll say I'll let our website be accessible on Port 80. probably would help to type correctly it's not going to hurt anything but you know someone else reads your stuff they want to make sure that it reads okay logs will leave that off default network is fine priority is fine Ingress means inbound egress means outbounds we want to get in like to get something back right we can allow or deny so we are allowing if we scroll on down below we can specify the ports this is TCP we're going to put Port 80 and then we'll go down below and go ahead and hit create does not like the name must be lowercase it's hard to remember all these rules we'll go ahead and hit create we'll give it a moment and what we'll do is go back to the internet hit enter and see if this is working doesn't seem to be working just yet let's give this a refresh see if our rule appears here so Port 80 that is correct priority so it has a high priority so it should be applied 32 203 103 forward slash 32 the 32 just means exactly that IP address we'll go up here it did not resolve so just give me a moment I'll take a think about this okay so I think we might have an easier way to uh make firewall rules in the way we were doing it here so what I'm going to do is go back to my instance here because I could have swore that it was here but I probably just forgot if we go down to view Network details I think here uh we'll get yeah so there is we don't have any network tags so we don't have any way to specify tag but here we have the external IP and the internal IP address and what I wanted to see was what firewall rules were being applied so here if we go over here we can see that we have Port 80 so this should be applying um and down below we could probably do a connect connectivity test here and we'll see what we get back okay we'll go ahead and create a connectivity test let's say uh Port 80 or Port 80 test TCP sounds good to me and we want this to hit the 35.203.103.0 and that's the IP address we could also just say the VM instance that's a lot easier I like that instead notice it's hitting the primary internal IP so that's not going to be very useful because we have to go from the outside in okay so we'll do 35.203.103.0 this is IP address used in gcp this is an IP address used in gcp when you yes it is okay um and that's correct so we'll do Port 80 and we'll say create and we'll see if we get some connectivity so it's just a way for us to effectively see if it's working um last time test last package transmission result so it's probably running it I'll just go here and hit rerun yeah that's fine and do I have a refresh button here new I don't and so it says it's reachable okay well it could go ahead and view the results so we have the VM instance the Ingress egress firewall rules the static route Nat Nat VM instance so everything seems to be working so maybe I'm crazy maybe our thing is working let's go back and take a look again okay but it's not working another thing we could do is we could open up our Cloud shell and so we were using Cloud shell within the server let's just make sure we're not on the inside we're not that's good and what we can do is just do a curl and paste in that IP address and see if we get anything returned back if it times out that means that it's not going to work and notice it's not it's timing out so we still have a firewall rule issue here so let me just try a bit more but hey we did learn we did learn about uh cognitivity tests so it's kind of nice so we'll be back in a moment here okay okay so I think I know what the problem is I haven't tried it yet but I was just staring at this thinking okay I put the IP address in why is it not working well the problem I think is is the fact that I provided the IP address uh for the VM instance but we're actually trying to say what is allowed in right so it really should be my IP address or a publicfacing internet so what I'll do is I'm just going to say what's my IP okay and we'll grab this here I bet that's the problem because we're not trying to allow the own server the own IP address of the server into itself that makes no sense it would make more sense if it was ours so what I'll do is go ahead and click this we'll go ahead and edit this Rule and we'll scroll on down and we'll switch this out for my IP address now you could do 0.0.0.04.0 and that's what you'd want to do if you're launching a real website here we'll go ahead and save it how embarrassing but uh it just goes to show it doesn't matter how many years you work with Cloud it's easy to get turned around okay so we'll go up here hit enter and now our website loads so there you go it's not that hard um as long as you know what you're doing okay so what we'll do is we'll make our way back uh to our instance so we'll say compute engine up here probably could pin it um I don't really I don't really like pinning things but so that was our instance um is there anything else of interest to show here not really so let's go ahead and just delete this instance okay and we'll hit refresh here okay it's going to delete I'm pretty confident about it I'm not too concerned about this resource and so what we'll do is go back and click on gcp or Google Cloud platform and uh we'll move on to the next follow along okay all right so we learned about compute engine let's go learn about I don't know let's say uh databases so what we'll do on the left hand side here is scroll on down and let's go take a look for um SQL so there's spanner and there's Esquibel so spanner uh it's a relational like it's its own variant of a relational database but it's not it's neither postgres or uh MySQL but if you were to be launching a web applications you'd probably want to just use the SQL service so we'll go here and we'll launch ourselves our own SQL instance so go ahead here and create an instance we have the option between MySQL postgres and SQL Server I am particular to postgres so I'll go ahead and click this and we'll go up here and so lowercase numbers letters so my relational database or my uh postgres and we'll need a password so we'll go ahead and generate one there we'll show the password just so I don't have to figure that out later and I need to dump that somewhere so I'm just pasting it off screen so just make sure you know where your password is uh postgres13 seems fine to me I like to launch things in Canada so let's go look for Canada there's Montreal we have single zone and multizone now notice does it show us the cost here it's not but I can tell you if you have it in multiple zones it should cost more because you're running redundant servers so I'm going to go single zone okay I want it to be cost effective all right we could even specify the zones I'm going to say any I don't care where it's going to go we can customize our configuration options so let's open it up because we want again the lowest cost for our example here um so we got high memory standards shared core shared core sounds cheap we have lightweight I'm just checking the values here over on the left hand side so look at high memory 26 26 gigabytes that's insane like I don't have a gaming computer that much we go over here now we're down to three seven uh seven gigabytes that's lightweight nothing I don't see anything changing there but I imagine it's cheaper that we have a shared core 600 megabytes this has to be cheap all right so this is the one we're going to choose for storage SSD is fine we don't we're not really doing anything real so I'm going to choose HDD that should be cheaper right I'm going to go 10 gigabytes because I'm not doing anything real enable automatic storage increase that's something you'd want to have but for our purposes I'm turning that off um do we want to have a public IP address well I do because I want to connect to it maybe do a query on it so we'll leave that there you might want to turn that off if you're running a secure workload generally you would and you just only allow um access through uh you know the um firewalls and stuff like that I do not need backups today we don't care when the maintenance Windows is flags are fine we don't need insights insights are nice if you want to query and see information I don't think this costs extra I'm going to leave it off anyway we don't need it today we can set labels as per usual so I can say EnV uh Dev should have been Dev last time too and so I'll go ahead and create this instance okay now I didn't specify a database name so maybe it's just the the identifier all right so I'll just wait for this to provision and I'll see you back here in a moment okay all right so after waiting a little while there it looks like our instance is ready it took about um I don't know 10 minutes for that to spin up uh not too bad and so down below we have the public IP address the outgoing IP address the connection name but looks like there's an easy way to connect with the cloud shells let's click and see if it auto fills it in for us that'd be really really nice I'm not sure if that's the case but I guess we'll find out here in a moment right looks like it is so it says gcloud SQL connect my postgres puts in the username which is postgres um so it looks good let's go ahead ahead and hit enter I might have entered that in twice there permission to deny Cloud SQL admin API has not been used in this project before or is disabled enable it by visiting this link so I guess that's what we'll have to go ahead and do so we'll go and click that link there and we'll give it a moment say enable usually this doesn't take too long sometimes you can tell by going up to the top so that's good so what we'll do is go back and hit up we'll hit enter and see if it connects now along your IP address for incoming connection for five minutes sounds cool can I do stuff I will say backslash D oh no we're waiting okay well not sure what's going on there that's not too clear but I mean that's not usually High we connect to a postgres instance what I would do is collect the names and use something like table plus and that's what I want to do here so that's what we're going to do okay all right so what I got here is uh table plus and this is just a way of connecting to postgres instances so go ahead and make a new connection to postgres this is free software by the way you can go and download it works on Windows Mac and Etc and so we got to fill in a bunch of these things so uh we need the host we need the username and the password so the username is postgres okay the password I saved earlier so I'm going to bring that on over here and paste that in um the database name would be what um it could be this is connection name but that's not very useful I mean my postgres is probably because this looks like it's this is probably the name of the database that's probably the um database name there is my postgres what would the host be uh usually like if it's AWS they have a connection URL I suppose you could use an IP address I'm just not used to having that so we have a public IP address and an outgoing IP address let's try the public IP address here 35 203 16 181 we'll say gcp my postgres here and so it looks like we have mostly everything the default Port is 5432 so we'll just do 5432 we'll hit test and see if that works fingers crossed okay so what I'm waiting for is this to go green it might not go green um let's just try connect instead on Mac it goes green you'll say hey you're connected and it did not connect okay so that's fine so what we'll do is we'll give it a little bit of check here so what else would we need to do okay maybe back I'll be back here in a moment okay you know something I was just thinking is um you know it looks like all our configuration settings are correct but maybe our firewall is just not open so what I'm going to do is make a new tab here and we'll give it a go it's all about trying things on the Fly here nothing's too hard for the cloud uh and we'll go firewall I just want firewall rules well that's app engine so we'll go here because I imagine this must be in a VPC so what we'll do is go here and create ourselves a new rule and I will say uh my postgres rule and we'll go down we'll let Ingress allow specify targets we're just going to do all instances in the networks with a particular IP range so um I'm just going to get my IP IP address like I did last time so my IP address right and we'll grab it there we'll drop it in four slash 32 we'll say TCP 5432 we'll go ahead and create that rule so now now that I have this rule on 5432 which is the port 4 postgres let's go ahead well I guess we got to wait we should probably be patient there is the rule I'm going to go ahead and hit test see if it works now probably it's not going to work if I have that colon in the name in the database we'll try again just connect here that doesn't work we'll just edit it again test connection is the server running 5432 still no good okay well I'll give it another try okay give me a second okay so another thought I had was I was just poking around and we have users and databases here on the left hand side so here we have postgres and then here we have uh postgres again so there is no database called I mean again I haven't tried it but there is no database called my postgres database that's just what I wrote in because I assumed it's based on the instant stand it's just the name of the instance internally for gcp so what would happen if I was to type in postgres instead here and then test this connection would this work because to me like this would make a lot more sense right uh and if that doesn't work I would say that we have the database right and the username is right but maybe there's something wrong with the host or the IP address or the connection so we go over to users that looks fine we go to the databases this one's called postgres so that is fine we go to connections um and it's public IP to authorize a network or use cloud SQL so we said public IP address is fine you do not have an authorized any external networks to connect to your Cloud SQL external applications you can still connect through Cloud proxy so if we don't have a network maybe that's our problem so oops what if I go and grab my IP address here maybe that's our problem forward slash 32 my home address we'll hit done uh we'll hit save scroll on down below here uh here it says you can manage if you're encrypted public IP address only allow unsecured connections are allowed to connect and that's fine we just want to be able to use it so what we'll do is go back here try this again we'll hit test and this thing is super buggy but notice that it's editing our postgres so I'll see you back here in a moment okay okay so we waited a short amount of time and what I'm going to do is go edit and notice my connection is postgres postgres the database password I put in the hostname and if I go ahead and hit connect it now connects so I don't think that firewall rule mattered at all that's for VM instances uh so I probably go back and just delete it out just to make sure you know that is the case so we just type in firewall here okay and I'm going to go ahead and delete this rule all right and now just to do a sanity check it's not uncommon for cloud service providers to have you know that stuff message separately like in AWS you have uh security groups that are like DB security groups that are specialized so to me that's not a surprise that was like that we'll get go ahead and hit edit hit connect can we still connect yes okay so that's how we had to grant us access now this is postgres this is the default table you really wouldn't be uh making uh or or database you wouldn't be making stuff inside of that what you'd probably want to do is go ahead and create a new database so what we can do go back to our instance here close some tabs out so we don't get confused and probably what we'd have to do is create a new database in here so we go here and I'd say um uh you know my database okay we'll hit create and we'll give that a moment to create probably the postgres user is a super user so we can do whatever we want there but if we go and enter a connection we're going to leave out the database it should allow us to connect to all of the databases here so it should show us postgres and the other one we might have to select our database so control K or oops that's not it Ctrl K okay so there we go so we can see we have Cloud SQL admin my database and postgres so I'll go ahead and click into postgres here all right and there are no tables but I can go and maybe I can make a new table here yep so there we go so we say ID and I will add a new column it will say name we'll make that a varchar let me just drop down change it to far char or text I just prefer text okay and we'll go ahead and save that create Untitled table oh we got to name the table so it's a users here and now what it does not like here zero length identifier create table undefined table well I just named it up here the primary ID would be ID up here can I save it now maybe it doesn't like this one hold on here I'm doing Ctrl s by the way to save it um I never create tables this way I always go through and make a manual connection um but I'm giving it a go here today for the first time so zero length eliminated identified at or near double quotations want to be named over here maybe I mean it's named right I don't know it doesn't doesn't want it um you know if that doesn't work that's totally fine the other way we could do this is um I'm just thinking here because if we like I don't have um postgres client installed on my local machine I don't think I do so I don't think I can use that I can try let's see here no I don't think I do so uh the only way I'd have to do that is probably through Cloud shell and through Cloud shell we would have to allow the IP address I don't know how much of a pain that is my point is is that you know like it's not necessary for the exam to know how to set up a table but the idea is to establish a connection I just wanted to show you how to do that and so I kind of feel like we've kind of satisfied it there and solved all the stuff that we wanted to do but what we'll do is we'll just go ahead and destroy this and we're all good to go okay and what we'll do is just check box that off or click into there we'll go ahead and hit delete and we will put in the instance name there we go and it's deleting I'm pretty confident that will delete and that's it there so we're done with that we'll move on to the next hey it's Andrew Brown from exam Pro and in this follow along I want to show you Google's app engine which allows you to easily deploy uh web applications so in the top left corner we'll go all the way up here to the navigation menu and we'll scroll on down looking for app engine which appears under serverless so we'll go there we'll go ahead and create ourselves a new application and the first thing we're going to see is a bunch of regions we can choose from I like to always choose from Canada so what I'll do is try to find my region if it is available might not be which is totally fine um and I don't think I'm going to get Canada today so I'll just go with us East one so let's zoom in on this map here oh no there's Canada there we go North America Northeast one grape so we'll go next and we'll give it a moment to load it's just thinking really hard there thinking really hard and I cannot tell if it's frozen so what I'm going to do is just give it a hard refresh here see if that helps at all all right so I just had to give it a hard refresh there uh in order for this to actually show up but what I want you to do is go down and we'll choose our runtime to be a ruby because that's what I know and love uh and we have the option between uh standard and flexible for the exam you definitely want to know the difference uh for this follow along not a big deal we're going to stick with standard here today and the great thing is they do have some samples here on GitHub so what I'm going to do is right click here and just take a look here at what they have and they've got a bunch of different stuff here uh and so what I'm thinking is we can open up our Cloud shell so I'm going to open up Cloud shell here at the top and it actually has an editor mode I haven't really given this a go so let's try it out I know what it looks like it's like vs code um but I'm just saying I haven't done a big workload in here yet so I'm kind of curious and we'll let that load up and oh yeah there's me doing some bigquery stuff from earlier but what I'm going to do yeah see I'm just doing a quick test there but what I'm going to do here is bring in a new repo so here um Source control I don't really use vs code but usually you can go here and press this button here uh um and that's not really helping so that's fine we'll open up the terminal it's not a big deal and I'm just going to do LS PWD to see where I am so I'm in my home directory and here it's going to ask me to do it get clone so I should be able to clone this and we'll hit enter and so now we have all those samples so the question is and here down below it says app engine forward slash app engine whatever what I noticed is that there is no folder called app engine so which one will be run well intuitively I would pick something like rails or maybe Sinatra so maybe they have a very simple example they also have static files so they have Sinatra and rails but um they have a Hello World example here and if we click into it it is Sinatra so I feel that this will probably be the easiest way to deploy and then we have our app yaml file that's actually how we configure um most like like whether it's app engine elastic Beanstalk or app uh Azure app Services there was some cap like this accompanying a configuration file that you can use with it I'm noticing that this is set to flex so maybe we might want to use flex mode and to me it doesn't really matter whether it's standard or flexible so maybe we'll just switch it over to flexible here um and what I'll do oops is it says initialize deploy so what I'll do is I'll just see into that hello world directory here oh we got a first CD into our Ruby docs and then into our hello world directory oh look at that now there is a uh there's an app engine right here maybe we're already in that folder okay that's why so we'll do app engine and then we'll do hello world okay and so we'll probably have to do a bundle install so just do a bundle install uh uh gem file cannot be required you have Etc it could be just because this machine doesn't have um a ruby installed so maybe we'll do um gem install bundler actually I didn't even check if this has Ruby does this have Ruby installed yeah it does okay and actually it's a very recent version so we'll do gem install bundler it's really not even necessary to do this but it's just out of habit I like to make sure that it uh it bundles before deploying bundler is just like requirements.txt or npm it's just Ruby's package manager or a composer if you're used to using PHP and so then I can just do a bundle install after install the packages did I not just install bundler gym install bundler yep it's installed bundle install um I'm I'm not really that worried about getting it running locally I just want to deploy it and so in order to deploy it we will have to run the G Cloud app deploy command we'll just double check and make sure that's the case here I'm pretty sure that's what it says down below yeah it's just as simple as this so hopefully this works no problem and we'll authorize it with gcloud if you're installing this locally you probably use gcloud.net to authenticate it's giving us some details here it's really hard to read this on white on black or black on white there but uh let's see what it's doing so we have a description it's going to tell us a source it's going to show us the target URL where it's going to deploy app engine uh default service account sounds good to me so we'll hit y for yes and we'll let it go ahead and provision probably the most simple out of all the providers in terms of like a platform as a service I would say gcp is out of all the three great and so if you just take a look there you can tell it's actually building out a containerized image so it gives you the idea that this is running off of containers also noticing that it's setting up Cloud SQL and cloud cloud SQL proxy so I would suppose if it needed to be backed by a database um this should be shouldn't require a database we'll just take a look here maybe the configuration it has that in there nope just says environments Flex runtime Ruby resources memory disk size Etc so I'm not I'm not sure why it's spinning up a relational database there but and this doesn't even have one but maybe that's just part of what it does okay so we'll just have to wait here a little bit a while and I'll see you back here in a moment okay all right and so after a little while there we can see there's a cloud build fail um it doesn't say as to why hold on here um you have out of gem Etc I know Ruby pretty well so for me uh it's not hard to figure out as to why but looks like we're gonna have to go check the log so I'm not sure what the logs are so just give me a moment I'll go figure that out okay all right so what I did here is I went down below and I opened up this link uh which brings us to our build details and if we scroll all the way down to the bottom notice how many steps it's out of 11 out of 14. so this is actually building the container image and when it went and uh and did a bundle install uh it ran into some trouble here so you're trying to install in deployment mode after changing your gem file run bundle install elsewhere and add the updated gem lock gem file.lock to the version control so um I think maybe we just have to get that bundle installed to work so what I'll do is go back here to my editor I really wish I could figure out how to change the theme Here Is there a way we can change the theme so I can see what I'm looking at I'm not sure maybe settings uh color theme and we will go Abyss oh there we go that's a little bit better so we'll work with that I suppose um so maybe we just need to make sure that the bundle install Works uh which is something I try to just get around but there's no gem lock file that's what it's probably going to be complaining about so if I just expand this here yeah notice there's no gem gem gemfall.lock or gem lock file so we'll do a bundle install and this time will just be a bit more thorough about its read so could not find bundler required by your home directory to update the latest version installed in your system do bundle update bundler so we'll do bundle update bundler let's see if that works I would have thought that we were up to the latest version because we ran it the lock file is being updated to bundler 2 after which you'll be unable to return to bundler one totally fine with that nobody uses bundler one anymore but if we take a look here on the left hand side I don't see um bundler gen lock file there so I'll do bundle install and so now I should have one you have to hit refresh here um so let's see one here let's do a clear and I'll do a LS hyphen la yeah it's right there so uh oh you know why it's because I'm not looking in the subfolder here so we're supposed to go app engine hello world and so there's that gem lock file so now let's go ahead and try that to play again I don't know what happens when you have a failed deploy like that so we'll just hit enter uh and I wonder if anything has changed here with app engine probably not probably a successful deploy while that's going let's go take a look here what was going on um through our build history so uh nothing exciting here but I wanted to see what services was so it was doing it through Cloud build so Cloud build um I imagine it's just like um uh AWS code build which is just a build server so it's a server that is designed to build things um and so that could be preparing uh artifacts for code or in this case it could be building out a image which I think that's what it was doing was building out an image so that's interesting how they uh they link that up so we'll go ahead and hit capital Y here and we'll let it go and deploy again and I will see you here at the end of it and hopefully it works or you know we'll encounter a new error okay all right so after waiting several minutes here uh it looks like it is done uh and it has a science command here called gcloud app browse I don't know if it's going to work within the um Google Cloud shell here let's give it a go and see what happens okay so it didn't detect a browser because we're not running it on our local machine we're running it within uh the Google shell but that's fine we can just copy that link and paste it up on here and so we can see the application is working so let's go give it a peek uh in the actual service let's see what we can see okay because usually usually we will see some additional stuff here so I'll go give this a hard refresh here uh I'm still showing us uh that we'll go ahead and click the dashboard here and so our app should be here uh looks like it must be running here um I'm just trying to distinguish okay up in the top right corner that's where we can see it we can see our versioning here we've got Services okay that makes sense if we wanted to upload uh different versions or we deploy new versions I guess would be version management so yeah pretty straightforward so I'd say we're all done here and now we just need to go ahead and tear this down um good question so I I mean I see this running here so I imagine we can just go ahead and delete it oops I have no idea how we should delete this so just give me a second and I'll figure this out okay all right so it looks like we don't delete app engines we just disable them uh so let's go ahead here and click on disable and we will enter this key in here okay and so that should disable it so why they don't let you delete them I do not know why um but I mean that's totally fine as long as we're not getting build so here it says your app has been currently disabled okay um so yeah there we go so we'll just make our way back here and move on to the next service this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and let's go take a look at some storage options for gcp in specific um cloud storage so what we'll do is scroll on down here so we got our compute and we have our storage and here is cloud storage okay and you will notice our screen's a bit messed up here just give it a whoops give it a hard refresh here to get that weird navigation out of the way but you can see that because we set up our app engine we already have some storage here but let's go ahead and create ourselves a new bucket and we'll just say uh my new bucket okay these are globally unique names so it's just like domain name so you might have to put in some random numbers there click continue now we have an option of multiregion dual region or just region with the lowest latency with a single region um I'm just going to stick with multiregion for this I'm going to see if I can choose Canada I actually only have three options U.S European union or Asia if I choose different ones what are my options do I get North America there we go so actually I want Toronto because that's the closest place that I am here uh clearly multiregion would give you the highest availability but if you want the lowest latency and you just want a single region more options you probably might just want to choose a region there okay we'll go ahead and hit continue I like on the right hand side it's estimating our cost here now we have our different storage options this will absolutely show up on the exam so you need to know the difference so standard best for shortterm storage and frequently accessed data near line best for backup and data access less than a month cold line best for disaster recovery and data access less than once a quarter archive best for longterm digital preservation of data access lesson once a year so we're going to stick with standard uh and then here it says prevent Public Access one of the most um uh common vulnerabilities for cloud service providers is through cloud storage when they're made public especially on AWS I'm sure it's no different for gcp so it's probably good to have a public access prevention turned on on the bucket and then you have access controls under it you have uniform and fine grade we're not sharing this with anybody else so we don't have to worry about that we'll go ahead and hit continue you'll notice that we can set encryption to be the Google manage encryption key or a customer manage encryption key we'll just stick with Google's manage key there because that's very easy you can set up a retention policy if we check boxes we get more information so we could say how long we want to retain uh stuff for I'm going to leave that off for now apply labels as per usual we'll go ahead and create our bucket and so now that we have our bucket let's go ahead and I'm going to create a new folder I'm going to call it Star Trek okay and what I'll do is I'll just go grab some images to upload just a couple images and I'll be back here in a second okay all right so let's go ahead and upload some files so I'm going to click into the Star Trek folder we're going to hit upload files I'm going to go into my Star Trek folder and I have a couple of Graphics from my uh one of my previous courses here we'll hit upload and you'll see the files upload and there they are if you want to go ahead and download them there's a download button on the right hand side we have some other options uh here nothing super important I'm going to go ahead and delete these files okay and give that a moment not that this would cost us anything to keep these two teeny tiny files around but it's probably a good habit to learn how to delete stuff at this level here uh and I'll go ahead and delete my new bucket and we will type in delete to permit and delete it okay and there you go that is Google Cloud Storage hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we are taking a look here at bigquery so what I want you to do is go to the top and type in bigquery and this is one of Google's Flagship products because it does something that other cloud service providers does not do and it's the fact that it's a serverless data warehouse so other providers like redshift or um I'm kind of forgetting the one Azure uh synapse uh things like that they are not serverless that means that they have an idle cost that you pay for and they're generally really expensive uh but uh bigquery is very cost effective because it can scale to zero and you're paying for consumption okay so uh for me it's actually a service I definitely use on a regular basis and I really really like it so just to kind of give you an idea of how this works now if you have not attached your credit card yet and you're using the sandbox it is totally safe to do this but if you do have your credit card attached I probably suggest not queryinged if you're trying to be cost effective here but they have a bunch of data sets here and so here is one for covid and a lot of these are public data sets or I mean this one is at least and that means that Google has made it available to you and for this one in particular for new users you can store up to 10 gigabytes of data up to and query up to one terabyte each month for free so you can really play around with bigquery in that sense once you attach a credit card it's no longer free actually I'm not really sure if if it's if it's still extended to be free outside of sandbox mode uh but I can't be certain okay so if we go back here we don't have to do anything the data set's already there we just have to reference it so it was a bit hard to find any available queries but I did find one on this blog post so thank you whoever did this and let's go ahead and grab this here and see if we can run ourselves a successful query notice it's going to suggest how much data it's going to process this is important because it's our consumption and we'll go ahead and hit run okay and we will see what we get back and so there we there we go we got some data back you go ahead and explore the data so export in data Studio or geoviz so if you have some other things there you could see that data create some live dashboards and things like that but that's pretty much it that's all I really wanted to show you um and that is bigquery hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and in this video we're just going to take a peek into vertex AI um I just like doing this because at some point you know maybe your company or or you might be considering to do a little bit of ml okay uh and the thing is a lot of people are scared of it and they're really worried about it being extremely expensive and so this is kind of my way of just kind of getting your toes toes uh uh into the pool um so you're not too afraid to do it so we'll go ahead here and type in vertex AI that is gcp's offering and we'll go ahead and just enable it and I wonder if I can do it in Canada I always like to pick Canada if I can Montreal because if it was Toronto they just don't have data I mean they have data centers there but there's never data centers for the main providers there and so uh we chose our region okay and I just want to do anything like opening a notebook that's usually uh what we would want to do but what I really want to show you is about compute because that is the the hidden cost uh to any type whether it's sagemaker um uh Azure ml Studio or data Studio ml Studio I can't remember off the top of my head was called vertex AI it's just that you have to remember to turn off the servers if you remember that it's very not scary to use um these services so if we want to have a notebook so migrate your notebook I don't have any right now but I just want to run anything so we'll go ahead and create ourselves a new instance and so here uh just like all the other ones you'd have to choose your environment Cuda or gpus you do not want to touch because those are super super expensive so we will just choose python3 notice it comes with scikit learn pandas and more that's usually the safest one here if you look here it'll tell us what it's spinning up so four vcpus 15 gigabytes of RAM 100 gigabyte standard so it's pretty darn large but that's pretty standard for uh what you'd want to use um so what we'll do is go ahead and hit create actually let's go take a look at Advanced options I've never clicked that before um nothing exciting there so we'll go ahead and hit create notice it says a hundred and two dollars a month so you if you're afraid to run this don't do it but I mean we're going to turn it on and turn it off so it's like not going to cost us much right um so I'll go ahead and spin that up there okay and I'm not sure how fast this is going to start up on AWS they have like ones that will start up within one or two minutes but I don't think that's something that is offered on gcp or or azure so the green usually means it's running setting up the proxy to Jupiter lab so this is what we really want to do is we want to open up Jupiter lab so we'll just have to wait a little while until that's ready okay so I'll see you back here in a moment all right so after waiting a very short while there now we can see we have this open Jupiter Labs we'll go ahead and click that and that will give us our Jupiter lab environment this is just an IDE specialized for data scientists or people working in the data field notice that it comes preloaded with tutorials which is pretty nice so we have some bigquery Cloud ml engine fairing storage um if we go in here this would show us how to work with bigquery pragmatically and the idea here is you go ahead and you just hit play on these okay uh and the idea is you if you hit play I'm not too afraid of doing this if you want to just watch that's totally fine as well but uh here it says locations are required Etc et cetera so that ran and so here this would just query some public data set so that's something we did when we did bigquery we just ran a query there but if we hit run it should output the results notice there's a asterisk it just means that it's running so give it a bit of time and so there is its data so this is pretty um you know this is pretty uh uh you know pretty straightforward um and very similar experience to the other providers there so once you learn one you kind of learn them all but yeah the real thing that you got to be a bit fearful of is the fact that uh you know depending on the machine type you choose they get really expensive so what you can do I'm just going to check if they have them on the left hand side here sometimes the providers will have like a category just for compute but when you're actually in Jupiter Labs you can go over here um oh it shows the kernel session if you're on um uh AWS they would actually show you the compute here that you can shut it down but what we can do is if we're really concerned about it we just go here and stop stop the instance okay but the thing is is that you could also be paying for storage so that could be kind of expensive so I'll actually just go ahead and delete it but we have to stop I think the instance before we can go ahead and delete it so we'll give this a refresh here okay and while that's going I just want to show you something else actually I really like this channel called by Cloud because uh they cover a lot of different kind of AI techniques but the reason I'm bringing it here is not to promote this channel but more so because they'd like to link in these Google collab files and so Google collab is kind of a way of um utilizing it's kind of it's like a notebook it's a like a jupyter notebook uh or it might may be a jupyter notebook it just doesn't look onetoone with the Jupiter Labs notebook but it allows you to run ml models but also to utilize gpus and gpus uh like your graphics cards are really really expensive in the cloud and so this is an opportunity where you can use it for free and you're just sharing it with other people and it's one of Google's initiatives to allow you to learn in a costfree way with Google and I think it's really cool but you can just click through this stuff and kind of get a result so I'd go here and hit run I'll just say run anyway that's totally fine with that okay and I can't just say run all like that and this is not going to cost me anything like I do not have to worry about it so that's something that's really nice that Google lets you do I assume it's you using under utilized machines or machines that aren't being in use so if you are learning you could just you know use Google collab uh but if you uh if you need to use you need to build a real model to deploy then you're going to be doing that with jupyter labs and vertex AI okay so I'm going to see if that is finished shutting down yet is it done no it's pending uh I'm gonna shut that down maybe that was causing the issue there okay so I'll wait till it gets out of the pending State here um and this is just running I don't know this is even gonna do uh execute a 3D photo in painting it's gonna do something cool something relating uh relating to uh something to change poses for people okay but anyway um I'll see you back here in a moment when this is out of pending okay all right so just as I stopped the video it it uh it also stopped the instance so now I can go ahead and delete it we'll just say say delete okay and that should take care of uh any lingering costs just in case you're following along and you do not want to get billed a hundred dollars by the end of the month there probably was instances that were a bit cheaper that we could have chose uh like you don't have to do this I'm just kind of taking a look here so there probably was yeah so we could have we could have chose something like this notice that was 29 that would have been a lot safer to do um because when I think of like sagemaker and and azure's uh ml Studio or Studio this is usually the cost that I run my notebooks at so probably just had a very expensive default and we just had to change it down below to this okay um I figured that was probably the case but I should have showed you that as we're doing it so you're not super scared so really the real cost would be thirty dollars and you can do a lot with that but again you can use Google Cloud for free but there you go that's it hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and I'm going to show you how to book a Google certification exam so in this particular one I'm booking for the cloud digital leader and so uh the idea here is we're going to go ahead and register for this exam and then we would need to choose our preferred language and what you're going to notice that up here this is powered by Criterion so Criterion is a global testing solution similar to psi or Pearson VUE but for whatever reason this is the one that Google is partnered with so you might need to log in but if you don't have one you'll have to go ahead and create yourself a new account and so just looking at the details here login password Etc address there's a lot of information to go on here so just notice for the asterisk I'm going to go ahead and fill all this out so I'll see you back here in a moment all right so I filled in all my information we'll go ahead and hit save great and we've created our accounts let's go ahead and log in so I'll just put in my username I chose I was lucky to actually get my own name I was really surprised but I'll go grab my password Here great and so now we can go ahead and register for our exam so here we can see all the exam uh exam possibilities here and so what I want to do is go ahead and find the one I'm looking for which is the digital team leader Cloud digital leader there it is let's go ahead and hit the Plus we have two options onsite or proctored at this time I'm going to do a remote proctored exam and so I have some options to choose here um so I think I would like today is the 27th oh I gotta choose my time zone so we'll go up here at the top I'm in the Toronto time zone and actually that's the date I want so it's the only date on the calendar but that's perfect for me and I need to choose my appropriate time and that is going to be 8 pm and so then we just have the usual instructions here so no shows cancellations reschedule retake policy online test center exam terms and conditions so you'll want to go through that and read this very very thoroughly okay and once you're happy with it you're going to go ahead and hit select I do not have a coupon but if you did you could enter it in there if you are happy with the time and to make sure it's the correct exam and the correct language go ahead and check out and so now this is where I'm going to go ahead and enter in my credit card details all right great so that's all filled in there so let's go ahead and hit submit and so it's just saying here that for our registration to be complete we have to receive a confirmation email so I'm going to wait here a little bit and just wait until I see that okay so I just want to show you here I've received it just was instantaneously which was great since it's like zero seconds and so it's just a refresher of our uh exam details there so it's going to really help you find that stuff quicker so that's all good there and if I go ahead and hit done there's nothing else to do there so there you go
