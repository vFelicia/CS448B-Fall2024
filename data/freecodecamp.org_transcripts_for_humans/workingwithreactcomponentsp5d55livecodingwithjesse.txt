00:05 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:07 - with Jesse I'm Jesse and today's gonna
00:09 - be a short stream because I have
00:13 - somewhere to be in less than an hour so
00:17 - we're going to try to do one Pomodoro
00:18 - session of code and also my camera keeps
00:22 - cutting out so I may just switch to my
00:27 - screen and if the camera cuts out I'll
00:30 - just I'll let it cut out usually when
00:32 - this happens I can bring it back for a
00:34 - couple minutes but if I really want it
00:35 - to work for longer than a few minutes I
00:38 - have to completely restart my computer
00:40 - which I don't have time to do right now
00:44 - I do want to say I want to give you an
00:49 - update on this project very quickly
00:52 - first and then I'm gonna let you know
00:56 - what we're gonna do today then we'll
00:58 - start the timer
00:59 - well one Pomodoro session and and then
01:01 - new questions after that so the the
01:08 - project now officially has a deadline we
01:14 - have a launch date so this is not a hard
01:18 - launch date it's a self-imposed launch
01:20 - date so you know we're not gonna get in
01:23 - trouble if we don't you know hit the
01:25 - date but I'd like to go for June 4th so
01:29 - it's the first Monday in June
01:31 - I'd rather launch on Monday and then
01:32 - that way I have all week in case
01:35 - anything goes wrong to work on now we
01:38 - were gonna go for June first but that's
01:40 - a Friday and that's the worst day to try
01:42 - to launch something so so that gives us
01:47 - about seven weeks so there's gonna be
01:52 - other things that come up during that
01:54 - time so I can't spend you know every
01:56 - single you know day of those seven weeks
01:58 - I'm also gonna probably go to a
02:00 - conference at some point between now and
02:01 - then so that's gonna take a few days but
02:04 - I've broken things down and I haven't
02:07 - haven't typed these up yet there's just
02:09 - written on a
02:10 - Notepad so I'm gonna break it down
02:11 - really quickly I'd like to within the
02:13 - next week
02:15 - fix some things with the menu to include
02:18 - all the links and that's what we're
02:20 - gonna start doing today and then I'd
02:25 - like to take another week and connect
02:28 - the the search inputs and the a bar and
02:31 - in the side nav to the actual search
02:34 - function and then clean up that search
02:37 - with the few remaining things that we
02:39 - really we needed to do then for the next
02:43 - three weeks I just want to bring data
02:45 - over so that we have all the data there
02:48 - I'm not gonna work as much on making it
02:50 - look nice yet that's we're gonna save
02:52 - that for the end and then get all the
02:55 - routes working so that if you go to one
02:58 - of the old URLs it will take you to the
03:00 - new page and then whatever time is left
03:05 - when we need to set up the the WordPress
03:09 - installation I want to make sure that
03:12 - that's on a server that can handle the
03:15 - load that it's likely to get so that'll
03:19 - we'll do a week for that that get leaves
03:22 - us with about a week left for anything
03:26 - else that comes up so it's gonna be
03:28 - tight but I overestimated how long I
03:31 - think these things will take so
03:33 - realistically I'm expecting you know to
03:36 - have more than one week so we'll see how
03:40 - it goes but that's the timeline for
03:43 - right now and the bulk of that is
03:45 - transferring data over so that's I'm not
03:48 - going to do that on the stream because
03:49 - that's just boring it's just me going
03:51 - through spreadsheet double-checking URLs
03:53 - I'm hoping to get some help from student
03:57 - workers and kind of going through data
04:00 - and cleaning things up so hopefully I
04:02 - can get some help with that and that
04:05 - should should help I want other people
04:07 - double-checking that we've successfully
04:09 - migrated the content and then all the
04:11 - links still work
04:18 - also today I haven't McDonald's coffee
04:21 - so anybody from McDonald's if you're
04:23 - watching you could sponsor me with free
04:27 - coffee and then I'll tell everybody
04:29 - every day that I drink me Thomas coffee
04:31 - so let's see all right so let's switch
04:40 - over now and we'll get to it well let me
04:46 - show you what I want to do first
04:47 - obviously okay so here's what's gonna
04:49 - happen for this stream
04:51 - Rohit asked if that was the dollar size
04:53 - coffee yeah it is so like this is the
04:57 - large but the small medium and large
04:59 - coffees are all $1 so obviously I'm
05:03 - gonna buy the large right even if I
05:05 - don't really need that much coffee I'm
05:07 - gonna buy the large and just drink it
05:10 - anyway
05:11 - right now I'm really like I really love
05:14 - the McDonald's app and I keep trying to
05:15 - find the best deals so I try to figure
05:21 - out what combination of coupons will
05:23 - will get me the most food for the least
05:25 - amount of money so on this particular
05:29 - page we have this side menu so these
05:34 - menu items do not appear in our main
05:37 - menu up at the top which we've moved to
05:40 - the side nav all right so my my camera
05:43 - cut out I'm just gonna leave it out
05:50 - let's see so we need to put these
05:54 - somewhere so there are two places where
05:58 - we're going to put them so for both
06:02 - mobile and and desktop we're going to
06:08 - take let me bring this over I'll just
06:12 - open it up cuz I don't know where I put
06:14 - it
06:14 - so let's open up localhost and actually
06:21 - I can start anger out for this as well
06:23 - so let's start anger out and let me
06:27 - paste this for you all
06:31 - you can check out the project as we are
06:33 - working on it with this n growth link if
06:35 - the link doesn't work for you right away
06:37 - then try copying and pasting the link
06:39 - instead of clicking it and then that
06:41 - usually works alright so you know feel
06:44 - free to click around or you know do
06:45 - whatever inspect it so basically right
06:48 - now we have this menu here it's just
06:52 - like one level deep so we have these
06:55 - main categories and that's it you can't
06:58 - go any farther but really all of these
07:01 - options here have I shouldn't say all of
07:05 - them most of them have sub menus so what
07:10 - I'd like to do is make it possible for
07:13 - these items to also be opened up and
07:18 - have that sub menu items displayed it's
07:22 - gonna be a little tricky in terms of
07:24 - indentation because we're gonna start
07:27 - running out of space we'll see but we'll
07:29 - just see how it looks you know we could
07:31 - afford to make this this navigation menu
07:34 - a bit wider if we need to so that's what
07:39 - we're gonna do today we're gonna try to
07:41 - make these sub menu items have the
07:44 - possibility of having sub menus
07:49 - themselves also and this is we're
07:53 - probably not we're not gonna get to this
07:55 - today but what I'd also like to do is on
07:57 - certain pages so let's let's find one so
08:03 - like on desktop we'll make a floating
08:07 - nav here that just kind of Scrolls with
08:11 - the user that would have menu items
08:14 - we've done something similar to this and
08:16 - react with material UI on a previous
08:19 - project so we're gonna look at how we
08:21 - did that and this will probably be in a
08:24 - stream tomorrow or you know some other
08:26 - day this week
08:27 - so anyway so that'll just have like an
08:31 - extra for the desktop that we don't
08:33 - really have room for on mobile but I
08:37 - think it will be very helpful for a user
08:39 - to not have to go
08:41 - get into this menu anyway so that's the
08:45 - idea if anybody has any thoughts on that
08:47 - put them in the live chat I'm gonna
08:49 - start up the timer and let's get to work
08:57 - mmm oh yeah I have this okay drawer item
09:02 - is where you wanna be let me make sure
09:06 - that I have the most up-to-date stuff
09:08 - all right cool so did it get pool it's
09:10 - up to date and let me make this a bit
09:15 - bigger all right that might be too big
09:18 - okay so here is beside this ok so right
09:28 - now we're just dealing with drawer item
09:30 - for now we're gonna need to edit some of
09:33 - the data so that we can support this
09:38 - this functionality so I think we already
09:41 - have everything that we need with the
09:42 - expansion and so
09:59 - okay yes so right now we're already
10:01 - doing the this expand items on click so
10:08 - what we need to do then mister Stane
10:22 - okay I do want to keep these as links so
10:28 - let's try so you have a list and then a
10:35 - link and then the list item inside of
10:38 - here
10:51 - okay
10:53 - and here's here's one of the problems
10:55 - that I'm thinking of so these are
10:58 - actually pages that they are linked so
11:00 - we want these to be clickable so and I'm
11:04 - open to suggestions on this do we want
11:08 - to have a little icon here that is
11:10 - separate so that if you click here it's
11:13 - still a link but if you click on this
11:14 - icon it actually drops down the menu or
11:18 - should we just make the first item in
11:20 - each submenu be the link in these
11:24 - themselves are not actually links let me
11:29 - know if you don't understand what I'm
11:30 - saying
11:31 - or what you think about this because we
11:34 - definitely need to we need to decide I
11:42 - think what would be will it make them in
11:49 - a sense I don't know I don't know what
11:54 - users will expect so I mean some of
11:58 - these won't have the links so it is
12:00 - gonna have the behavior that you can
12:01 - click it and it is a link so users will
12:04 - probably expect that all of them have
12:05 - that behavior so I'm thinking maybe like
12:10 - a clearly-defined button here with maybe
12:12 - a vertical border to separate it out but
12:19 - we're definitely going to need to change
12:21 - the way things work in here let me so
12:26 - many items with map all right so what
12:28 - we're gonna need then is a ternary to
12:32 - check to see if the submenu items have
12:35 - so many items but Erin says couldn't the
12:42 - submenus be drawers
12:50 - they they could be chores but I'm just
12:53 - wondering on mobile is there enough
12:56 - space for that originally I wanted them
13:00 - to be extra drawer that like came out on
13:02 - the side here and then I realized
13:06 - obviously that there's no space on
13:09 - mobile for that to happen we can at
13:15 - least start with the turn here because
13:17 - we're gonna need this no matter what
13:18 - really just trying to think what I want
13:26 - to call this the hardest part of code
13:28 - and figuring out what to what to name
13:30 - things so I guess some menu if item
13:41 - that's sub sub menu if item got sub menu
13:56 - then
14:04 - then we're gonna do whatever we're going
14:09 - to do here so for now I'll just put let
14:18 - me copy this let me do a dead first
14:37 - okay so what I will be doing here is
14:40 - just making two of these alright so
14:47 - here's what we have and I probably
14:49 - messed this up how to mess this up
15:00 - oh I'm returning things automatically
15:08 - and it should not be is that how do they
15:25 - if we have a sub menu item then we want
15:28 - to turn else we want to return that no
15:49 - why is my mind blanking we've done this
15:52 - on the stream so many times what am I
15:54 - missing let me do any parens
16:15 - it's
16:29 - okay so those in
16:50 - put a return before the condition okay
17:00 - actually
17:06 - do I need I return can I switch this
17:10 - back to what we had I should be able to
17:15 - switch it back to what we had now think
17:17 - about it
17:34 - I just have to go to another component
17:39 - and see how we did it my mind is
17:42 - blanking this is so silly
18:07 - I guess I didn't use that exactly in
18:10 - there
18:26 - okay I don't need that is that my
18:29 - program
18:45 - okay yeah
19:14 - yes I should still need this
19:34 - all right I mean my indentation is crazy
19:40 - for this and it's not Auto formatting
19:42 - probably because of the errors all right
19:47 - so where am i this should be fine do
19:51 - this link I just I'm not sure why why am
19:56 - I getting this
20:08 - there we go I was missing a paren all
20:12 - right cool
20:15 - does that ever happen anybody's like you
20:18 - go to do something you've done a million
20:20 - times before and then all you just can't
20:22 - remember the syntax okay so what we
20:26 - should get then is if our data
20:31 - I let me double check and make sure
20:34 - didn't break this first know it okay not
20:38 - broken excellent
20:39 - okay so right now none of our data has
20:45 - submenu so it's going to this which is
20:49 - what we've already had so it still looks
20:51 - the same which is exactly what we want
20:56 - so now we want to add in something extra
21:03 - if there is a submenu for that piece of
21:08 - data for that item so that we know this
21:11 - is actually working so for now I'm just
21:14 - gonna add in I don't know
21:25 - I'm gonna add this and this should be
21:28 - pretty ugly if we add it and oh yeah I
21:41 - know I have the data up here somewhere
21:43 - said pretty much never close it drawer
21:49 - menu yes here's the data we'll move it
21:51 - over here so we can see them both at the
21:53 - same time so let's grab let's just use
21:59 - this this first one it'll be easy so on
22:02 - the about menu is that our first one
22:04 - yeah under academically excellent we're
22:07 - going to add submenu and we'll just say
22:13 - true for an out if I could spell it
22:16 - you and that so submenu is true what
22:23 - we're gonna need to do is actually put a
22:25 - sub menu so sub menu itself is going to
22:28 - be in an object it's going to be an
22:30 - array of objects but for now we'll just
22:35 - do true and what this should do is make
22:41 - this messed up no maybe I'll refresh it
22:45 - just to be sure
22:49 - did I misspell it I did sub menu there
22:58 - we go
23:10 - there we are okay so all the rest of
23:13 - them work you know just like they should
23:15 - work and then now under academically
23:18 - excellent
23:18 - we have submenu right okay so this just
23:22 - proves that it works now we can actually
23:25 - create you know something a little icon
23:28 - or whatever we want at this point so
23:31 - let's work on s let's work on that okay
23:47 - yeah let's just let's work on getting
23:49 - that icon there for now
23:59 - oh this is the wrong project I'm looking
24:01 - at that like what is going on different
24:03 - projects okay so let's go in here and
24:13 - see I said let's go in and dev tools in
24:17 - Chrome first so I just want to see like
24:25 - what what's going on what kind of styles
24:27 - are already there so what would be the
24:29 - best way to modify this so what I'm
24:36 - gonna try to keep this clickable as a
24:38 - link and then add in something like this
24:42 - that is not part of the link so the
24:48 - actual a here which the a tag is let's
24:55 - see what it styles are you
25:06 - alright let's just mess around and give
25:08 - it see what we can can make it do
25:31 - maybe this is where I need to put it on
25:36 - this dead
25:37 - alright let's see No
26:07 - why's my
27:33 - foods
27:38 - let me shoot my time I think I'm running
27:40 - out of time if I can find my timer it's
27:43 - back here all right six minutes oops
27:48 - grab the wrong Oh y'all can't see me
27:51 - anyway I was I went to drink out of the
27:54 - wrong coffee cup okay what is going on
28:03 - in here that I can't put these in
28:09 - different actually I mean I guess I
28:14 - could use grid I could use the grid to
28:20 - make this happen I probably should do
28:25 - that I be better to just use what's
28:28 - built-in okay I mean I'm gonna have to
28:36 - import grid which I do we already have
28:40 - the grid imported here
28:42 - whoops another search there we go
28:54 - all right let's see how we did this good
29:00 - container great item so let's just grab
29:02 - this so we have it's yeah this should
29:11 - work so if we're gonna have submenu
29:19 - items we're gonna change this this div
29:22 - is gonna be our our grid container and
29:27 - then we'll have a grid item within there
29:35 - just our grid and this is the grid here
29:42 - and then we're gonna make another grid
29:44 - item for our our sub menu icon part so
29:53 - for this nine and three let's try 19 3
30:01 - and now we may not have to do any custom
30:06 - alignment at all if this works guess I
30:13 - forgot to close something yep and the
30:19 - grid system that we're using comes with
30:21 - material UI so some of these components
30:24 - or components that we created and then
30:28 - other components or components that
30:30 - we've gotten from it's your UI alright
30:34 - cool so we we do have this this
30:40 - positioning here let me refresh just to
30:45 - make sure any styles that we had are
30:48 - gone ok so right now this is extending
30:52 - past here which is it's ok because we're
30:57 - not gonna have an actual word here is
30:59 - just gonna be one icon
31:03 - okay so I mean unfortunately this forces
31:06 - this onto two lines it's not the end of
31:12 - the world we could definitely mess with
31:14 - the indentation a bit to try to make
31:16 - this give us some more space the icon I
31:20 - think definitely I don't think it really
31:23 - needs that much space really so we could
31:26 - I think we have more padding than we
31:32 - need
31:37 - yeah let me just let's see what you want
31:43 - your supporter left let's go with two
31:51 - pixels solid and what are we gonna go
31:57 - with RGB a zero zero zero zero point
32:11 - five four
32:17 - I think actually I want this to be
32:21 - thinner and lighter let's go wonderful
32:32 - there we go
32:36 - okay so we'll probably have a divider
32:39 - here so that this is clickable and we'll
32:45 - also take away this padding padding
32:52 - right it's gonna be zero just make sure
32:58 - that that's a flood okay padding right
32:59 - zero and then that way when we hover
33:01 - over it will go directly up to here
33:05 - padding right zero now that extends down
33:13 - below I don't like that what if
33:23 - yeah you know what we're gonna have to
33:25 - make that border appear on on this div
33:32 - it's just gonna have to be within here
33:34 - otherwise it's gonna look weird when we
33:36 - hover okay so my timer is up but
33:40 - basically this is what this is what is
33:44 - gonna happen now in terms of style right
33:47 - it it'll basically be an icon like this
33:50 - over here and so they'll be divided but
33:54 - when you click on this icon there'll be
33:56 - another set of items that show up which
34:00 - will be may be slightly more indented
34:03 - probably the same color though I don't
34:05 - know that I can go that much lighter I
34:07 - could potentially go with a slightly
34:10 - thinner font and see how that works
34:13 - just to add like another visual
34:16 - indication of hierarchy and the menu
34:18 - items but that's we're going to going to
34:22 - do so the way we would do that then is
34:25 - add into our our data under submenu
34:30 - instead of true we would add an array of
34:33 - objects that would look exactly like
34:35 - this and that that's what would populate
34:40 - another submenu so in the same way that
34:44 - we're looping through that we're looping
34:48 - through submenu items here they were
34:50 - mapping over them we would we would have
34:52 - another map within this portion for a
35:00 - for a submenu so we would have a like a
35:05 - collapse right and then we have a whole
35:10 - other submenu so that's what needs to be
35:14 - done for this to be finished
35:16 - I may save this and finish it in a shame
35:21 - tomorrow I mean I do have a lot of data
35:23 - to be transferred over that I could do
35:25 - not on the stream so maybe I'll save it
35:29 - let me know in the chat if if you would
35:31 - like to see how we would finish this
35:33 - component
35:35 - and you know if if it's something you
35:37 - want to see then I'll definitely hold
35:39 - off on finishing it until the next live
35:41 - stream and if you're watching this later
35:44 - and you can't participate in the live
35:46 - chat let me know in the comments please
35:49 - alright so that's what we have so far
35:51 - let's just want to do a get okay
36:10 - normally I wouldn't I wouldn't commit at
36:13 - this point because it's slowly like half
36:15 - finished but I want this to be available
36:17 - to all of you to be able to check out
36:19 - what we've done so far so that's why I'm
36:22 - gonna commit this as is so the link to
36:29 - this repository is in the description
36:31 - it's available for you to you know take
36:33 - any of the code use it for whatever you
36:35 - need to use it for if you want to submit
36:36 - pull requests that's awesome as well
36:39 - let's see a new feature scope for this
36:45 - change to add
37:01 - submenus for so many layers okay
37:12 - no breaking changes and I don't believe
37:15 - we have any open issues dealing with
37:17 - this I may have them but I'm in a hurry
37:22 - right now so all right so I'm gonna
37:27 - scroll all the way up to the top of the
37:29 - live chat answer as many questions as I
37:31 - can I think based on what's in the live
37:33 - chat now I there shouldn't be a problem
37:35 - in getting to everyone's questions today
37:38 - all right great that worked passed all
37:40 - the tests awesome now we'll do a git
37:42 - push there we are Boston all right so
37:52 - now all this code is available to you
37:55 - all to to do whatever you want to do
37:57 - with all right so a lot of people saying
38:00 - hi hey everyone
38:14 - oh I'm she says you are the most starred
38:18 - get repo holders oh it really is the
38:20 - free code camp repo the most art that's
38:26 - awesome
38:39 - domain you cat says you really need the
38:41 - best deals with your salary yeah
38:46 - unfortunately I do um yeah I mean
38:51 - realistically you know if you save a few
38:54 - like let's say I can get the food for
38:56 - half of what it is so I don't know like
39:00 - instead of five dollars it would be two
39:04 - dollars and fifty cents you know that
39:07 - adds up I mean that's I don't go every
39:09 - day but let's say I go twice a week I
39:11 - save five dollars a week let's say
39:14 - there's four weeks in a month you know
39:15 - that's $20 a month that's over two
39:19 - hundred dollars a year and that's just
39:22 - for McDonald's so I mean you can see if
39:24 - I do the same thing at the grocery store
39:25 - or at other restaurants to everything
39:27 - you know that's yeah it doesn't sound
39:32 - like a lot I guess but still it's I mean
39:38 - that's money that go towards something
39:41 - for my kids or my wife or you know just
39:44 - say you know saving it for you know an
39:47 - emergency
39:54 - I mean I'm not saying that I'm poor or
39:56 - anything right I think I'm I can pay all
39:59 - my bills and so I'm thankful for that
40:03 - but I'm not at the point where I I can
40:07 - just say forget it I don't need qfo see
40:15 - some kid says can we use style
40:18 - components for styling all our
40:20 - components yeah I mean you can normally
40:27 - like for what we're doing in this
40:28 - project there are some situations that
40:30 - we we can't use it eventually though I
40:34 - would like it to get to the point where
40:37 - we we can use like react like in
40:42 - component styles for everything it's
40:44 - just going to take a while to get the
40:46 - data to the point where that's gonna you
40:50 - know be doable so that's the goal I
40:57 - think you know if we really work at it
40:59 - we could get there you know by the end
41:01 - of this year but I know already my boss
41:06 - is talking about the next like two
41:08 - projects that I'll be working on after
41:09 - this one so I think there's gonna be
41:11 - it's gonna be harder for me to justify
41:13 - keep working on this project when it's
41:16 - already launched especially if it
41:17 - launches well and there's no issues it's
41:20 - trying to make the argument that like a
41:22 - it'd be really cool if we could clean up
41:23 - this data it's gonna be a little tougher
41:27 - so I really do hope it happens but it's
41:31 - it's going to be something that happens
41:32 - just a little bit at a time
41:47 - California boy says because of the small
41:49 - screen on mobile you should have defined
41:51 - buttons I'm not sure where you what you
41:56 - mean I mean I'm assuming like we're
42:01 - getting you know we're gonna have
42:03 - buttons in terms of like an icon on the
42:10 - side therefore the menu items so I guess
42:11 - we you know we are doing that
42:16 - okay Youssef says maybe on mobile the
42:19 - new drawer could just replace the old
42:22 - drawer that's that's actually an option
42:27 - I haven't thought about that but that's
42:30 - that's a legitimate option if what we're
42:35 - gonna try to do now ends up just not
42:37 - looking good or being confusing then we
42:42 - may try to do that so I think that's a
42:44 - good idea Youssef thank you Oh answers
42:49 - you could show a menu history at the top
42:51 - yeah actually these are all really good
42:54 - ideas I'm definitely gonna have to
42:58 - consider these as an alternative Puyo
43:07 - says am I the only one who finds
43:10 - JavaScript frameworks like angular or
43:13 - react very difficult after how many
43:15 - years you started working with one I
43:18 - find them difficult at first I mean I've
43:22 - only been working with reactor II about
43:24 - a year maybe a year and a few months and
43:28 - I'm very comfortable with it now I mean
43:32 - I would not say I'm an expert at all but
43:34 - I don't find it difficult so but at
43:39 - first I did and when I first worked with
43:41 - angular I found it difficult now I
43:43 - didn't stick with angular so it's
43:45 - probably still difficult for me if I
43:47 - would try it but I think it's just you
43:50 - know like any new thing it's gonna be
43:51 - difficult at first and it you know some
43:54 - frameworks just take longer to get
43:56 - from within others I yeah I mean it's I
44:01 - think that's just the way it is with any
44:03 - new you know new framework it's actually
44:08 - we're doing the stream without the
44:11 - camera like on my face because now I'm
44:13 - like I don't have to think about it
44:18 - normally have to think that I don't do
44:19 - anything weird on camera but and I have
44:23 - to think like okay I need to make sure
44:24 - my face is actually in the camera but
44:26 - now like I can sit like really slaps
44:30 - down in my chair and lean back
44:33 - anyway let me keep going I'm almost
44:36 - through the live chat now you check the
44:38 - time
44:39 - okay good this is I'm gonna have to end
44:41 - things at like 10 minutes at the most
44:44 - let's see Ian
44:55 - oops sorry not Ian
44:57 - oh I see Ian was responding to my
45:02 - question so I asked if anyone else had
45:05 - the issue where you try to do something
45:07 - that you've done a million times before
45:08 - and like for some reason you just can't
45:10 - remember the syntax and so Ian sits all
45:13 - the time thanks thanks for that I'm glad
45:17 - I'm not the only one Jacob says Mac or
45:20 - Windows for programming use such as Mac
45:23 - or Linux honestly I really do like Mac
45:29 - for programming I haven't I haven't used
45:34 - a linux as an operating like a desktop
45:37 - operating system I haven't use Linux
45:38 - I've used it on servers though and I
45:41 - like it so I'm kind of used to Linux and
45:46 - Mac right now I used the program but for
45:48 - years I programmed on a Windows machine
45:51 - so there are pros and cons I think to
45:56 - everything but right now I I do really
46:01 - like programming on a Mac
46:06 - so I don't know that I could give a
46:07 - great answer for it Jacobs has been
46:12 - wanting to learn HTML CSS but I'm having
46:15 - a hard time self teaching myself
46:18 - watching to see any suggestions Youssef
46:21 - says watching tutorials makes it easy
46:23 - for me Jacob says anyone know of any
46:29 - teachers in person I don't want to wait
46:31 - for college yeah I am that's tough I
46:36 - mean I guess you could try so you don't
46:41 - have to wait for college so I'm assuming
46:42 - you're maybe in high school then it's
46:46 - gonna be tough so like normally you
46:47 - could go to a boot camp like in person
46:52 - but if you're in high school I mean
46:55 - maybe you could find a boot camp that's
46:56 - during like summer break from high
46:59 - school and I'd say that's that's
47:01 - probably you know the most likely way
47:07 - that you have of finding an in-person
47:10 - teacher yeah so I would say that unless
47:15 - you can find someone in your area like
47:17 - maybe like a meet-up like a web
47:20 - developer meetup and see about getting
47:21 - like a mentor on anyone else have any
47:26 - other ideas for how Jacob can find like
47:30 - someone to help in person in learning
47:33 - HTML and CSS
47:43 - hey amenities here how's it going thanks
47:47 - for watching
47:50 - Carlos says check the free code camp
47:52 - website for learning oh yeah if you
47:54 - haven't already tried free code camp go
47:56 - to free cookie org and start in with
47:59 - some of those lessons I mean they it's
48:02 - still gonna be like you have to motivate
48:04 - yourself to do it but hmm sorry I won't
48:10 - but it is it has helped a lot of people
48:14 - to learn aim star asked what font we're
48:17 - using for menu items it's Roboto I
48:21 - believe that we were using a 400 font
48:26 - weight right here and the color is rgba
48:31 - 0 0 0.5 for which I mean you can see all
48:39 - that if you check out the repository
48:51 - all right Aaron asked if there's a
48:53 - stream or video to see what it did to
48:55 - get to this point there are actually a
48:57 - lot of streams this is the fifty-fifth
48:58 - stream for this project so you can go
49:02 - back through and check out all the
49:03 - streams that is it's gonna be a lot
49:07 - might not be a bad idea to do a recap
49:10 - video yeah maybe I'll have to think
49:15 - about doing a recap video because 55
49:17 - streams is quite a lot especially since
49:20 - almost every stream is over an hour long
49:22 - I mean that's literally days of non-stop
49:26 - watching to get through it
49:28 - I do recommend watching old streams of
49:30 - on like faster than normal speed I
49:34 - usually talk like somewhat slowly so you
49:37 - can still understand me on to time speed
49:43 - let's see
49:52 - my mommy says last time you said you'll
49:54 - be live on Monday I know I know I've
49:56 - Monday yesterday I'm sorry I forgot to
49:59 - apologize for this I know I said I'd be
50:01 - live on Monday but yesterday just filled
50:04 - up with meetings so since I've been
50:06 - working from home a lot all my meetings
50:09 - have to fit into the like two days that
50:11 - I'm I'm at work this week I'm actually
50:15 - gonna be in three days but so then my
50:18 - days filled with meetings so I ended up
50:20 - like having several people over the
50:24 - weekend asked me for meetings so then my
50:28 - schedule just got full one meeting ended
50:30 - up getting canceled so I probably could
50:32 - have Street squeeze the stream in but it
50:35 - didn't and know that it got cancelled
50:38 - until it was like really close to the
50:41 - meeting time so I do I apologize for
50:44 - that it's just like I said it my
50:47 - schedule just filled up you know the day
50:50 - before so I mean sometimes that happens
50:54 - so I can't I can't you know say no I
51:01 - can't meet with you because of the live
51:03 - stream so try to be respectful about
51:06 - that so that I can keep doing the live
51:07 - stream on campus
51:19 - Andy says oh I never mind Andy was
51:23 - asking somebody else something in the
51:25 - chat in a asks is it hard to do a dev
51:30 - job without experience there's just a
51:34 - lot of learning involved so I mean yeah
51:38 - it's it's hard you know because starting
51:40 - on anything new is is hard oh you know
51:44 - what actually I think I misread that I
51:47 - think in a correct me if I'm wrong but I
51:49 - to get it oh I see later on you
51:51 - corrected it is it hard to get a dev job
51:53 - without experience yeah it can be a lot
51:58 - of places are looking for experience but
52:01 - don't be afraid to apply and try to make
52:05 - up for that lack of experience with a
52:07 - really good portfolio even if that
52:09 - portfolio is just side projects that you
52:12 - made on your own it really doesn't
52:15 - matter if their projects and their
52:16 - functional and their good projects you
52:19 - know then whoever's you're applying to
52:22 - you know they can see the quality they
52:26 - can see the code they can see the the
52:29 - project so that's that's how you would
52:32 - make up then for the lack of experience
52:34 - and then always try to get projects on
52:36 - the side even if even if you have to do
52:39 - volunteer stuff if you can afford to
52:41 - take some time to do volunteer things at
52:43 - least that's something you could put
52:45 - down you know that you build this
52:46 - website for this company
52:48 - alright you don't they don't need to
52:49 - know how much money you made off of it
52:51 - or if you made any money at all you know
52:54 - so that can that can help convince a
52:59 - company that even though you don't have
53:00 - a lot of experience you do know what
53:02 - you're doing so but I mean I don't want
53:05 - to mislead it is going to be hard it's
53:07 - definitely easier if you have that
53:08 - experience but it's not impossible you
53:13 - know you just have to kind of be
53:14 - creative and in building up that
53:17 - portfolio and presenting yourself you
53:19 - know in the right way of you know on
53:21 - your resume like really emphasize your
53:23 - projects where if somebody else might
53:25 - emphasize their work experience if they
53:27 - had a lot you know don't worry about
53:30 - that on your
53:31 - they you know put your projects up at
53:34 - the top and breasts impress them first
53:37 - and then once they get down to the
53:38 - bottom and see all there's not much work
53:40 - experience they're already gonna like
53:42 - you so they're gonna be way more likely
53:44 - to overlook the the lack of work
53:47 - experience right does that make sense
54:07 - let's see Andy asked how do you
54:10 - structure your react projects I mean
54:14 - what right now we're using next Jas so
54:17 - we really just use the folder structure
54:19 - that that's built out with next
54:21 - sometimes we use create react apps so we
54:23 - pretty much stick with that structure
54:34 - tech expert says hello I know CSS and
54:37 - JavaScript HTML CSS and JavaScript what
54:40 - should I learn next and your choice
54:41 - between PHP and nodejs right now
54:44 - I choose nodejs right now I'm not saying
54:49 - there's anything wrong with PHP but if
54:51 - you know JavaScript for front-end it's
54:54 - so much easier to just pick up node node
54:58 - can do so many different things the only
55:01 - disadvantage right now for node is that
55:03 - a lot of cheap hosting providers don't
55:07 - let you use node but they will let you
55:10 - use PHP so like if you're gonna go with
55:12 - GoDaddy share hosting or something
55:14 - you're not at least last time I checked
55:16 - you're not gonna be able to use node so
55:19 - that's that's really the only thing but
55:22 - you know the people that are using the
55:24 - cheap hosting providers like that they I
55:30 - don't that's probably not where you'd
55:32 - want to get if you're really into coding
55:34 - and want to develop like cool things
55:36 - with node or something like that like
55:38 - those are the clients that are gonna
55:40 - have the money to pay you for something
55:41 - like that anyway they're not the clients
55:44 - they're gonna be able to pay for a lot
55:46 - of custom stuff so it's not like you'd
55:47 - be doing a lot of custom PHP you
55:49 - probably be setting up a wordpress site
55:53 - but I I go with node I only do PHP when
55:57 - I really have to and I focus on learning
55:59 - node you know better so that would be my
56:02 - recommendation
56:07 - himemiya says I wonder why everyone is
56:09 - using rubato and Latino fonts we use
56:12 - Roboto because it's in the material
56:14 - design specification so I mean yeah
56:21 - that's that's just what we use I mean I
56:22 - think it's a good font I think the odds
56:25 - of people being familiar with it and
56:27 - like having a cache in the browser are
56:29 - pretty good as well so it's a free font
56:40 - Raphael asks a lovely name Raphael I
56:43 - name my oldest son Raphael so awesome
56:46 - name but Raphael s Jessie which Mac are
56:50 - you using right now I have an iMac and
56:54 - I'll bring up the specs for you here
56:59 - it's gonna be hard to see it's kind of
57:00 - small
57:01 - but it's the iMac retina 5k 27-inch late
57:08 - 2014 I'm running four gigahertz intel
57:13 - core i7 and 32 gigabytes of RAM and I
57:20 - have two external monitors connected to
57:23 - it I have the 2k 27-inch screen on one
57:27 - side and then I have a 1080p screen in
57:33 - vertical alignment on the other side you
57:42 - see FS about meteor J s I don't know
57:46 - that much about meteor I've seen some
57:48 - presentations where people do really
57:49 - cool things with meteor but I don't have
57:52 - personal experience with it so I guess
57:54 - all I know is that you can make really
57:56 - awesome things with me to your jazz and
57:58 - that's about the extent of my knowledge
58:00 - of meteor hey harsh it's here how's it
58:03 - going hard illnesses thank you for
58:11 - your answer you're welcome hopefully
58:15 - that that helped in and if you ever need
58:19 - help with like job trying to get a job
58:23 - or resume stuff or anything like just
58:25 - let me know you know send me a message
58:27 - through whatever social media and I'd be
58:31 - happy to like check out your portfolio
58:32 - or your resume and yes just just let me
58:37 - know Raphael says thanks Jesse yeah no
58:42 - problem
58:45 - mmm he says that's a lot of RAM I know
58:47 - is I had 16 to start out with in the
58:50 - the guy that works in the office next to
58:52 - me told me that he upgraded a 32 and
58:55 - then I was like all right I got upgraded
58:58 - 32 so I did but it I mean it helps I
59:05 - always have like a million tabs open in
59:08 - Chrome and in my computer is always fast
59:10 - so it's definitely it definitely helps
59:15 - see technics versus where to find cool
59:18 - projects to practice for web dev I mean
59:23 - you can check out the projects for free
59:26 - code camp and practice on those I mean
59:30 - those are some pretty cool projects like
59:32 - a weather app there are some games that
59:36 - you can make so I mean there's a lot of
59:38 - cool ideas for projects so you could
59:40 - either like following the instructions
59:42 - exactly on free code camp or you could
59:44 - just let it be inspiration for you for
59:46 - other things that you want to do that's
59:48 - free code camp org breakfast is awesome
59:54 - setup Thanks
59:55 - I love that more than three monitors
59:58 - because I used to run with four monitors
60:00 - but I you can't
60:01 - like by default you can't hook up a
60:04 - third monitor to an iMac I've read it
60:09 - there are some ways that you can make it
60:10 - work but it's not really easy the mummy
60:16 - says can I send you my resume yeah go
60:19 - ahead
60:20 - send it to me I guess well you can you
60:25 - can check in the description of this
60:28 - video there should be a link to my
60:30 - youtube channel and then from there I
60:32 - have all my different social media sites
60:36 - there so get in touch with me on
60:38 - whatever social media site and you know
60:43 - you can send me a resume like that let
60:45 - me give you all my my email
60:51 - all right so I just put my email on the
60:53 - live chat it's just Jessie why go
60:54 - gmail.com you send me something there -
60:58 - probably through social media is more
61:01 - reliable because like it won't
61:03 - accidentally end up in the spam folder
61:04 - or something but if you want to email me
61:07 - that's I mean that's also an option so I
61:11 - can't guarantee that like I'll get back
61:13 - to you in a certain amount of time
61:14 - because I mean sometimes I'm just really
61:16 - busy but I will try to get back to
61:18 - everybody at some point if you've asked
61:20 - me something in the past and I didn't
61:23 - get back to you please remind me because
61:26 - sometimes I do get a lot of messages and
61:28 - things just kind of get forgotten and
61:32 - lost and it takes a long time to scroll
61:34 - back to where that message was so it's
61:38 - entirely possible that I have forgotten
61:40 - about answering some of you who may have
61:43 - asked me something and I really don't
61:45 - want to do that so so please remind me

62:16 - yeah so until then have a wonderful day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse I'm Jesse and today's gonna be a short stream because I have somewhere to be in less than an hour so we're going to try to do one Pomodoro session of code and also my camera keeps cutting out so I may just switch to my screen and if the camera cuts out I'll just I'll let it cut out usually when this happens I can bring it back for a couple minutes but if I really want it to work for longer than a few minutes I have to completely restart my computer which I don't have time to do right now I do want to say I want to give you an update on this project very quickly first and then I'm gonna let you know what we're gonna do today then we'll start the timer well one Pomodoro session and and then new questions after that so the the project now officially has a deadline we have a launch date so this is not a hard launch date it's a selfimposed launch date so you know we're not gonna get in trouble if we don't you know hit the date but I'd like to go for June 4th so it's the first Monday in June I'd rather launch on Monday and then that way I have all week in case anything goes wrong to work on now we were gonna go for June first but that's a Friday and that's the worst day to try to launch something so so that gives us about seven weeks so there's gonna be other things that come up during that time so I can't spend you know every single you know day of those seven weeks I'm also gonna probably go to a conference at some point between now and then so that's gonna take a few days but I've broken things down and I haven't haven't typed these up yet there's just written on a Notepad so I'm gonna break it down really quickly I'd like to within the next week fix some things with the menu to include all the links and that's what we're gonna start doing today and then I'd like to take another week and connect the the search inputs and the a bar and in the side nav to the actual search function and then clean up that search with the few remaining things that we really we needed to do then for the next three weeks I just want to bring data over so that we have all the data there I'm not gonna work as much on making it look nice yet that's we're gonna save that for the end and then get all the routes working so that if you go to one of the old URLs it will take you to the new page and then whatever time is left when we need to set up the the WordPress installation I want to make sure that that's on a server that can handle the load that it's likely to get so that'll we'll do a week for that that get leaves us with about a week left for anything else that comes up so it's gonna be tight but I overestimated how long I think these things will take so realistically I'm expecting you know to have more than one week so we'll see how it goes but that's the timeline for right now and the bulk of that is transferring data over so that's I'm not going to do that on the stream because that's just boring it's just me going through spreadsheet doublechecking URLs I'm hoping to get some help from student workers and kind of going through data and cleaning things up so hopefully I can get some help with that and that should should help I want other people doublechecking that we've successfully migrated the content and then all the links still work also today I haven't McDonald's coffee so anybody from McDonald's if you're watching you could sponsor me with free coffee and then I'll tell everybody every day that I drink me Thomas coffee so let's see all right so let's switch over now and we'll get to it well let me show you what I want to do first obviously okay so here's what's gonna happen for this stream Rohit asked if that was the dollar size coffee yeah it is so like this is the large but the small medium and large coffees are all $1 so obviously I'm gonna buy the large right even if I don't really need that much coffee I'm gonna buy the large and just drink it anyway right now I'm really like I really love the McDonald's app and I keep trying to find the best deals so I try to figure out what combination of coupons will will get me the most food for the least amount of money so on this particular page we have this side menu so these menu items do not appear in our main menu up at the top which we've moved to the side nav all right so my my camera cut out I'm just gonna leave it out let's see so we need to put these somewhere so there are two places where we're going to put them so for both mobile and and desktop we're going to take let me bring this over I'll just open it up cuz I don't know where I put it so let's open up localhost and actually I can start anger out for this as well so let's start anger out and let me paste this for you all you can check out the project as we are working on it with this n growth link if the link doesn't work for you right away then try copying and pasting the link instead of clicking it and then that usually works alright so you know feel free to click around or you know do whatever inspect it so basically right now we have this menu here it's just like one level deep so we have these main categories and that's it you can't go any farther but really all of these options here have I shouldn't say all of them most of them have sub menus so what I'd like to do is make it possible for these items to also be opened up and have that sub menu items displayed it's gonna be a little tricky in terms of indentation because we're gonna start running out of space we'll see but we'll just see how it looks you know we could afford to make this this navigation menu a bit wider if we need to so that's what we're gonna do today we're gonna try to make these sub menu items have the possibility of having sub menus themselves also and this is we're probably not we're not gonna get to this today but what I'd also like to do is on certain pages so let's let's find one so like on desktop we'll make a floating nav here that just kind of Scrolls with the user that would have menu items we've done something similar to this and react with material UI on a previous project so we're gonna look at how we did that and this will probably be in a stream tomorrow or you know some other day this week so anyway so that'll just have like an extra for the desktop that we don't really have room for on mobile but I think it will be very helpful for a user to not have to go get into this menu anyway so that's the idea if anybody has any thoughts on that put them in the live chat I'm gonna start up the timer and let's get to work mmm oh yeah I have this okay drawer item is where you wanna be let me make sure that I have the most uptodate stuff all right cool so did it get pool it's up to date and let me make this a bit bigger all right that might be too big okay so here is beside this ok so right now we're just dealing with drawer item for now we're gonna need to edit some of the data so that we can support this this functionality so I think we already have everything that we need with the expansion and so okay yes so right now we're already doing the this expand items on click so what we need to do then mister Stane okay I do want to keep these as links so let's try so you have a list and then a link and then the list item inside of here okay and here's here's one of the problems that I'm thinking of so these are actually pages that they are linked so we want these to be clickable so and I'm open to suggestions on this do we want to have a little icon here that is separate so that if you click here it's still a link but if you click on this icon it actually drops down the menu or should we just make the first item in each submenu be the link in these themselves are not actually links let me know if you don't understand what I'm saying or what you think about this because we definitely need to we need to decide I think what would be will it make them in a sense I don't know I don't know what users will expect so I mean some of these won't have the links so it is gonna have the behavior that you can click it and it is a link so users will probably expect that all of them have that behavior so I'm thinking maybe like a clearlydefined button here with maybe a vertical border to separate it out but we're definitely going to need to change the way things work in here let me so many items with map all right so what we're gonna need then is a ternary to check to see if the submenu items have so many items but Erin says couldn't the submenus be drawers they they could be chores but I'm just wondering on mobile is there enough space for that originally I wanted them to be extra drawer that like came out on the side here and then I realized obviously that there's no space on mobile for that to happen we can at least start with the turn here because we're gonna need this no matter what really just trying to think what I want to call this the hardest part of code and figuring out what to what to name things so I guess some menu if item that's sub sub menu if item got sub menu then then we're gonna do whatever we're going to do here so for now I'll just put let me copy this let me do a dead first okay so what I will be doing here is just making two of these alright so here's what we have and I probably messed this up how to mess this up oh I'm returning things automatically and it should not be is that how do they if we have a sub menu item then we want to turn else we want to return that no why is my mind blanking we've done this on the stream so many times what am I missing let me do any parens it's okay so those in put a return before the condition okay actually do I need I return can I switch this back to what we had I should be able to switch it back to what we had now think about it I just have to go to another component and see how we did it my mind is blanking this is so silly I guess I didn't use that exactly in there okay I don't need that is that my program okay yeah yes I should still need this all right I mean my indentation is crazy for this and it's not Auto formatting probably because of the errors all right so where am i this should be fine do this link I just I'm not sure why why am I getting this there we go I was missing a paren all right cool does that ever happen anybody's like you go to do something you've done a million times before and then all you just can't remember the syntax okay so what we should get then is if our data I let me double check and make sure didn't break this first know it okay not broken excellent okay so right now none of our data has submenu so it's going to this which is what we've already had so it still looks the same which is exactly what we want so now we want to add in something extra if there is a submenu for that piece of data for that item so that we know this is actually working so for now I'm just gonna add in I don't know I'm gonna add this and this should be pretty ugly if we add it and oh yeah I know I have the data up here somewhere said pretty much never close it drawer menu yes here's the data we'll move it over here so we can see them both at the same time so let's grab let's just use this this first one it'll be easy so on the about menu is that our first one yeah under academically excellent we're going to add submenu and we'll just say true for an out if I could spell it you and that so submenu is true what we're gonna need to do is actually put a sub menu so sub menu itself is going to be in an object it's going to be an array of objects but for now we'll just do true and what this should do is make this messed up no maybe I'll refresh it just to be sure did I misspell it I did sub menu there we go there we are okay so all the rest of them work you know just like they should work and then now under academically excellent we have submenu right okay so this just proves that it works now we can actually create you know something a little icon or whatever we want at this point so let's work on s let's work on that okay yeah let's just let's work on getting that icon there for now oh this is the wrong project I'm looking at that like what is going on different projects okay so let's go in here and see I said let's go in and dev tools in Chrome first so I just want to see like what what's going on what kind of styles are already there so what would be the best way to modify this so what I'm gonna try to keep this clickable as a link and then add in something like this that is not part of the link so the actual a here which the a tag is let's see what it styles are you alright let's just mess around and give it see what we can can make it do maybe this is where I need to put it on this dead alright let's see No why's my foods let me shoot my time I think I'm running out of time if I can find my timer it's back here all right six minutes oops grab the wrong Oh y'all can't see me anyway I was I went to drink out of the wrong coffee cup okay what is going on in here that I can't put these in different actually I mean I guess I could use grid I could use the grid to make this happen I probably should do that I be better to just use what's builtin okay I mean I'm gonna have to import grid which I do we already have the grid imported here whoops another search there we go all right let's see how we did this good container great item so let's just grab this so we have it's yeah this should work so if we're gonna have submenu items we're gonna change this this div is gonna be our our grid container and then we'll have a grid item within there just our grid and this is the grid here and then we're gonna make another grid item for our our sub menu icon part so for this nine and three let's try 19 3 and now we may not have to do any custom alignment at all if this works guess I forgot to close something yep and the grid system that we're using comes with material UI so some of these components or components that we created and then other components or components that we've gotten from it's your UI alright cool so we we do have this this positioning here let me refresh just to make sure any styles that we had are gone ok so right now this is extending past here which is it's ok because we're not gonna have an actual word here is just gonna be one icon okay so I mean unfortunately this forces this onto two lines it's not the end of the world we could definitely mess with the indentation a bit to try to make this give us some more space the icon I think definitely I don't think it really needs that much space really so we could I think we have more padding than we need yeah let me just let's see what you want your supporter left let's go with two pixels solid and what are we gonna go with RGB a zero zero zero zero point five four I think actually I want this to be thinner and lighter let's go wonderful there we go okay so we'll probably have a divider here so that this is clickable and we'll also take away this padding padding right it's gonna be zero just make sure that that's a flood okay padding right zero and then that way when we hover over it will go directly up to here padding right zero now that extends down below I don't like that what if yeah you know what we're gonna have to make that border appear on on this div it's just gonna have to be within here otherwise it's gonna look weird when we hover okay so my timer is up but basically this is what this is what is gonna happen now in terms of style right it it'll basically be an icon like this over here and so they'll be divided but when you click on this icon there'll be another set of items that show up which will be may be slightly more indented probably the same color though I don't know that I can go that much lighter I could potentially go with a slightly thinner font and see how that works just to add like another visual indication of hierarchy and the menu items but that's we're going to going to do so the way we would do that then is add into our our data under submenu instead of true we would add an array of objects that would look exactly like this and that that's what would populate another submenu so in the same way that we're looping through that we're looping through submenu items here they were mapping over them we would we would have another map within this portion for a for a submenu so we would have a like a collapse right and then we have a whole other submenu so that's what needs to be done for this to be finished I may save this and finish it in a shame tomorrow I mean I do have a lot of data to be transferred over that I could do not on the stream so maybe I'll save it let me know in the chat if if you would like to see how we would finish this component and you know if if it's something you want to see then I'll definitely hold off on finishing it until the next live stream and if you're watching this later and you can't participate in the live chat let me know in the comments please alright so that's what we have so far let's just want to do a get okay normally I wouldn't I wouldn't commit at this point because it's slowly like half finished but I want this to be available to all of you to be able to check out what we've done so far so that's why I'm gonna commit this as is so the link to this repository is in the description it's available for you to you know take any of the code use it for whatever you need to use it for if you want to submit pull requests that's awesome as well let's see a new feature scope for this change to add submenus for so many layers okay no breaking changes and I don't believe we have any open issues dealing with this I may have them but I'm in a hurry right now so all right so I'm gonna scroll all the way up to the top of the live chat answer as many questions as I can I think based on what's in the live chat now I there shouldn't be a problem in getting to everyone's questions today all right great that worked passed all the tests awesome now we'll do a git push there we are Boston all right so now all this code is available to you all to to do whatever you want to do with all right so a lot of people saying hi hey everyone oh I'm she says you are the most starred get repo holders oh it really is the free code camp repo the most art that's awesome domain you cat says you really need the best deals with your salary yeah unfortunately I do um yeah I mean realistically you know if you save a few like let's say I can get the food for half of what it is so I don't know like instead of five dollars it would be two dollars and fifty cents you know that adds up I mean that's I don't go every day but let's say I go twice a week I save five dollars a week let's say there's four weeks in a month you know that's $20 a month that's over two hundred dollars a year and that's just for McDonald's so I mean you can see if I do the same thing at the grocery store or at other restaurants to everything you know that's yeah it doesn't sound like a lot I guess but still it's I mean that's money that go towards something for my kids or my wife or you know just say you know saving it for you know an emergency I mean I'm not saying that I'm poor or anything right I think I'm I can pay all my bills and so I'm thankful for that but I'm not at the point where I I can just say forget it I don't need qfo see some kid says can we use style components for styling all our components yeah I mean you can normally like for what we're doing in this project there are some situations that we we can't use it eventually though I would like it to get to the point where we we can use like react like in component styles for everything it's just going to take a while to get the data to the point where that's gonna you know be doable so that's the goal I think you know if we really work at it we could get there you know by the end of this year but I know already my boss is talking about the next like two projects that I'll be working on after this one so I think there's gonna be it's gonna be harder for me to justify keep working on this project when it's already launched especially if it launches well and there's no issues it's trying to make the argument that like a it'd be really cool if we could clean up this data it's gonna be a little tougher so I really do hope it happens but it's it's going to be something that happens just a little bit at a time California boy says because of the small screen on mobile you should have defined buttons I'm not sure where you what you mean I mean I'm assuming like we're getting you know we're gonna have buttons in terms of like an icon on the side therefore the menu items so I guess we you know we are doing that okay Youssef says maybe on mobile the new drawer could just replace the old drawer that's that's actually an option I haven't thought about that but that's that's a legitimate option if what we're gonna try to do now ends up just not looking good or being confusing then we may try to do that so I think that's a good idea Youssef thank you Oh answers you could show a menu history at the top yeah actually these are all really good ideas I'm definitely gonna have to consider these as an alternative Puyo says am I the only one who finds JavaScript frameworks like angular or react very difficult after how many years you started working with one I find them difficult at first I mean I've only been working with reactor II about a year maybe a year and a few months and I'm very comfortable with it now I mean I would not say I'm an expert at all but I don't find it difficult so but at first I did and when I first worked with angular I found it difficult now I didn't stick with angular so it's probably still difficult for me if I would try it but I think it's just you know like any new thing it's gonna be difficult at first and it you know some frameworks just take longer to get from within others I yeah I mean it's I think that's just the way it is with any new you know new framework it's actually we're doing the stream without the camera like on my face because now I'm like I don't have to think about it normally have to think that I don't do anything weird on camera but and I have to think like okay I need to make sure my face is actually in the camera but now like I can sit like really slaps down in my chair and lean back anyway let me keep going I'm almost through the live chat now you check the time okay good this is I'm gonna have to end things at like 10 minutes at the most let's see Ian oops sorry not Ian oh I see Ian was responding to my question so I asked if anyone else had the issue where you try to do something that you've done a million times before and like for some reason you just can't remember the syntax and so Ian sits all the time thanks thanks for that I'm glad I'm not the only one Jacob says Mac or Windows for programming use such as Mac or Linux honestly I really do like Mac for programming I haven't I haven't used a linux as an operating like a desktop operating system I haven't use Linux I've used it on servers though and I like it so I'm kind of used to Linux and Mac right now I used the program but for years I programmed on a Windows machine so there are pros and cons I think to everything but right now I I do really like programming on a Mac so I don't know that I could give a great answer for it Jacobs has been wanting to learn HTML CSS but I'm having a hard time self teaching myself watching to see any suggestions Youssef says watching tutorials makes it easy for me Jacob says anyone know of any teachers in person I don't want to wait for college yeah I am that's tough I mean I guess you could try so you don't have to wait for college so I'm assuming you're maybe in high school then it's gonna be tough so like normally you could go to a boot camp like in person but if you're in high school I mean maybe you could find a boot camp that's during like summer break from high school and I'd say that's that's probably you know the most likely way that you have of finding an inperson teacher yeah so I would say that unless you can find someone in your area like maybe like a meetup like a web developer meetup and see about getting like a mentor on anyone else have any other ideas for how Jacob can find like someone to help in person in learning HTML and CSS hey amenities here how's it going thanks for watching Carlos says check the free code camp website for learning oh yeah if you haven't already tried free code camp go to free cookie org and start in with some of those lessons I mean they it's still gonna be like you have to motivate yourself to do it but hmm sorry I won't but it is it has helped a lot of people to learn aim star asked what font we're using for menu items it's Roboto I believe that we were using a 400 font weight right here and the color is rgba 0 0 0.5 for which I mean you can see all that if you check out the repository all right Aaron asked if there's a stream or video to see what it did to get to this point there are actually a lot of streams this is the fiftyfifth stream for this project so you can go back through and check out all the streams that is it's gonna be a lot might not be a bad idea to do a recap video yeah maybe I'll have to think about doing a recap video because 55 streams is quite a lot especially since almost every stream is over an hour long I mean that's literally days of nonstop watching to get through it I do recommend watching old streams of on like faster than normal speed I usually talk like somewhat slowly so you can still understand me on to time speed let's see my mommy says last time you said you'll be live on Monday I know I know I've Monday yesterday I'm sorry I forgot to apologize for this I know I said I'd be live on Monday but yesterday just filled up with meetings so since I've been working from home a lot all my meetings have to fit into the like two days that I'm I'm at work this week I'm actually gonna be in three days but so then my days filled with meetings so I ended up like having several people over the weekend asked me for meetings so then my schedule just got full one meeting ended up getting canceled so I probably could have Street squeeze the stream in but it didn't and know that it got cancelled until it was like really close to the meeting time so I do I apologize for that it's just like I said it my schedule just filled up you know the day before so I mean sometimes that happens so I can't I can't you know say no I can't meet with you because of the live stream so try to be respectful about that so that I can keep doing the live stream on campus Andy says oh I never mind Andy was asking somebody else something in the chat in a asks is it hard to do a dev job without experience there's just a lot of learning involved so I mean yeah it's it's hard you know because starting on anything new is is hard oh you know what actually I think I misread that I think in a correct me if I'm wrong but I to get it oh I see later on you corrected it is it hard to get a dev job without experience yeah it can be a lot of places are looking for experience but don't be afraid to apply and try to make up for that lack of experience with a really good portfolio even if that portfolio is just side projects that you made on your own it really doesn't matter if their projects and their functional and their good projects you know then whoever's you're applying to you know they can see the quality they can see the code they can see the the project so that's that's how you would make up then for the lack of experience and then always try to get projects on the side even if even if you have to do volunteer stuff if you can afford to take some time to do volunteer things at least that's something you could put down you know that you build this website for this company alright you don't they don't need to know how much money you made off of it or if you made any money at all you know so that can that can help convince a company that even though you don't have a lot of experience you do know what you're doing so but I mean I don't want to mislead it is going to be hard it's definitely easier if you have that experience but it's not impossible you know you just have to kind of be creative and in building up that portfolio and presenting yourself you know in the right way of you know on your resume like really emphasize your projects where if somebody else might emphasize their work experience if they had a lot you know don't worry about that on your they you know put your projects up at the top and breasts impress them first and then once they get down to the bottom and see all there's not much work experience they're already gonna like you so they're gonna be way more likely to overlook the the lack of work experience right does that make sense let's see Andy asked how do you structure your react projects I mean what right now we're using next Jas so we really just use the folder structure that that's built out with next sometimes we use create react apps so we pretty much stick with that structure tech expert says hello I know CSS and JavaScript HTML CSS and JavaScript what should I learn next and your choice between PHP and nodejs right now I choose nodejs right now I'm not saying there's anything wrong with PHP but if you know JavaScript for frontend it's so much easier to just pick up node node can do so many different things the only disadvantage right now for node is that a lot of cheap hosting providers don't let you use node but they will let you use PHP so like if you're gonna go with GoDaddy share hosting or something you're not at least last time I checked you're not gonna be able to use node so that's that's really the only thing but you know the people that are using the cheap hosting providers like that they I don't that's probably not where you'd want to get if you're really into coding and want to develop like cool things with node or something like that like those are the clients that are gonna have the money to pay you for something like that anyway they're not the clients they're gonna be able to pay for a lot of custom stuff so it's not like you'd be doing a lot of custom PHP you probably be setting up a wordpress site but I I go with node I only do PHP when I really have to and I focus on learning node you know better so that would be my recommendation himemiya says I wonder why everyone is using rubato and Latino fonts we use Roboto because it's in the material design specification so I mean yeah that's that's just what we use I mean I think it's a good font I think the odds of people being familiar with it and like having a cache in the browser are pretty good as well so it's a free font Raphael asks a lovely name Raphael I name my oldest son Raphael so awesome name but Raphael s Jessie which Mac are you using right now I have an iMac and I'll bring up the specs for you here it's gonna be hard to see it's kind of small but it's the iMac retina 5k 27inch late 2014 I'm running four gigahertz intel core i7 and 32 gigabytes of RAM and I have two external monitors connected to it I have the 2k 27inch screen on one side and then I have a 1080p screen in vertical alignment on the other side you see FS about meteor J s I don't know that much about meteor I've seen some presentations where people do really cool things with meteor but I don't have personal experience with it so I guess all I know is that you can make really awesome things with me to your jazz and that's about the extent of my knowledge of meteor hey harsh it's here how's it going hard illnesses thank you for your answer you're welcome hopefully that that helped in and if you ever need help with like job trying to get a job or resume stuff or anything like just let me know you know send me a message through whatever social media and I'd be happy to like check out your portfolio or your resume and yes just just let me know Raphael says thanks Jesse yeah no problem mmm he says that's a lot of RAM I know is I had 16 to start out with in the the guy that works in the office next to me told me that he upgraded a 32 and then I was like all right I got upgraded 32 so I did but it I mean it helps I always have like a million tabs open in Chrome and in my computer is always fast so it's definitely it definitely helps see technics versus where to find cool projects to practice for web dev I mean you can check out the projects for free code camp and practice on those I mean those are some pretty cool projects like a weather app there are some games that you can make so I mean there's a lot of cool ideas for projects so you could either like following the instructions exactly on free code camp or you could just let it be inspiration for you for other things that you want to do that's free code camp org breakfast is awesome setup Thanks I love that more than three monitors because I used to run with four monitors but I you can't like by default you can't hook up a third monitor to an iMac I've read it there are some ways that you can make it work but it's not really easy the mummy says can I send you my resume yeah go ahead send it to me I guess well you can you can check in the description of this video there should be a link to my youtube channel and then from there I have all my different social media sites there so get in touch with me on whatever social media site and you know you can send me a resume like that let me give you all my my email all right so I just put my email on the live chat it's just Jessie why go gmail.com you send me something there probably through social media is more reliable because like it won't accidentally end up in the spam folder or something but if you want to email me that's I mean that's also an option so I can't guarantee that like I'll get back to you in a certain amount of time because I mean sometimes I'm just really busy but I will try to get back to everybody at some point if you've asked me something in the past and I didn't get back to you please remind me because sometimes I do get a lot of messages and things just kind of get forgotten and lost and it takes a long time to scroll back to where that message was so it's entirely possible that I have forgotten about answering some of you who may have asked me something and I really don't want to do that so so please remind me if if I have done that and if so I apologize okay so I've gone past the time that I had to be somewhere so now I am late so I'm gonna end now and thank you all for watching I should be able to stream tomorrow so hopefully I'll be back tomorrow and I guess we'll work on this probably we'll work on this component a little bit more yeah so until then have a wonderful day
