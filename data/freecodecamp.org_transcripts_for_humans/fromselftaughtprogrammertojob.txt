With timestamps:

00:00 - so today we are going to talk about um
00:02 - from self-taught programmer to job uh
00:05 - the reason why we are talking about that
00:07 - is because free code camp is actually
00:09 - the platform where people start to start
00:13 - learning to code
00:14 - but also to get a job in a completely
00:17 - new industry completely different
00:18 - industry that they are used to used to
00:21 - be or used to to work
00:23 - and
00:25 - we were asked many times to
00:27 - talk about our experience and we both
00:30 - came practically from nothing to a
00:32 - program a job and that's why we are
00:34 - talking about it today we will have a
00:36 - question and answer session afterwards
00:38 - so
00:39 - feel free to ask everything you'd like
00:43 - yes just a short roadmap what we're
00:45 - going to cover we will talk about our
00:47 - life before
00:48 - uh we will talk about the learning
00:49 - process we will talk about applying for
00:52 - jobs
00:53 - we will talk about working at the new
00:55 - company
00:56 - then this year explain the main
00:59 - qualities and actions to get a job
01:01 - actually
01:02 - and the last the last thing will be
01:03 - about motivation because people always
01:06 - ask how do you stay motivated on the on
01:08 - the way
01:10 - um so yeah let's let's start with our
01:12 - life before programming
01:14 - um
01:15 - how many of you guys actually started to
01:18 - program
01:20 - from a completely different field
01:25 - cool so like
01:27 - 50
01:28 - something roughly very nice um
01:30 - yeah so so you guys know what it takes
01:32 - to like
01:34 - start with a completely new
01:36 - set of of rules and mindset
01:39 - in my case it was like
01:41 - i'm a student i'm a business law student
01:44 - uh i have worked in different uh
01:47 - business law firms tax advisory firm
01:50 - had different workshops and also had
01:53 - like entrepreneurial stuff
01:56 - but most of the time i was also like
01:58 - non-profit worker so most of the time i
02:00 - was just student working and working
02:03 - here just working and studying my whole
02:05 - life so
02:07 - not really much programming i had no
02:09 - idea what html was
02:11 - nothing
02:13 - yes
02:14 - that's that's about me
02:17 - yeah
02:18 - and with his background in business and
02:20 - such i had a different background i grew
02:23 - up on a wet cold mountain in bergen i
02:26 - was raised by sheep farmers it was quite
02:29 - miserable at times but no that's not the
02:32 - real story but
02:33 - maybe i should control them yeah
02:36 - but i did grow up in
02:38 - or by wet mountains in bergen
02:42 - it's one of the rainiest cities in north
02:44 - and northern europe it has about 250
02:46 - days of rain a year
02:48 - so it gets quite miserable but we
02:50 - strangely enough we cope
02:52 - and
02:53 - i didn't get raised by sheep farmers but
02:56 - we have national costumes in norway that
02:58 - are mainly made of wool
03:00 - and just pay special attention to
03:03 - the fact that these socks are purely
03:05 - made out of sheep's wool handcrafted and
03:08 - such so they're always a pain to put on
03:10 - for these occasions they go up until
03:12 - like here
03:13 - so that's nice
03:16 - my
03:17 - background back to childhood i was
03:19 - always the computer guy in class i
03:20 - always liked from the first chance i had
03:23 - with a dad or with a dad working in tech
03:25 - to uh
03:27 - you know bash at the keyboard or h5 or
03:29 - something from a
03:30 - commodore or macintosh or something
03:33 - i
03:34 - always
03:35 - found out they had or early on found out
03:37 - they had a love for computers
03:38 - i didn't take it further until then
03:41 - learning html
03:43 - making some websites i had two parents
03:46 - my father
03:48 - and my mother they got divorced
03:50 - whenever i was at my dad and i used to
03:51 - live mainly at my mom's place
03:53 - he had internet so i could get tutorials
03:56 - on how to learn html print them out go
03:58 - back to my you know regular home
04:01 - on a computer with no internet learn how
04:03 - to make stuff with html it was really
04:06 - cool but then a couple of years later i
04:08 - got a book java in 21 days and i was
04:10 - like yes
04:11 - but i was the kind of person who since i
04:13 - didn't understand why it's a system out
04:16 - clinton
04:17 - i must be a stupid guy because there can
04:19 - only be math geniuses understands this
04:21 - is esoteric type we're writing out and
04:23 - why it makes some stuff happen and there
04:26 - was no one there for me to tell me that
04:29 - take a step back you're not stupid this
04:31 - is the same for everyone in the
04:32 - beginning
04:34 - and it was the same for me also in
04:35 - school learning maths it was easy for me
04:38 - or all courses in school was easy for me
04:41 - up until the stage where we had sort of
04:43 - like
04:44 - equations algebra and stuff
04:47 - and i thought that hey
04:49 - up until that point i just had to be in
04:50 - class pay attention barely do homework i
04:53 - did fine but then once i had to memorize
04:56 - rules and just apply them i didn't
04:58 - understand that that was what you were
04:59 - going to do i thought i had to
05:02 - really understand what was going on
05:03 - because that's how it had worked for me
05:05 - up until that point so
05:06 - all this just to say that i really had
05:09 - enforced the myth that
05:11 - programming is for math geniuses only so
05:14 - i kind of ruled it out from that from
05:15 - that point on
05:18 - and then skipping ahead a little bit
05:19 - young adult life
05:21 - instead of going into computer school
05:22 - which i maybe let's just call it that
05:24 - which i maybe would have done if i would
05:27 - have not have this misconception
05:29 - i instead said hey let's try psychology
05:32 - studies didn't work out let's try to
05:34 - study philosophy
05:35 - didn't work out then i kind of
05:37 - prioritized student life and working
05:39 - instead of studying and at one point i
05:41 - panicked realized i couldn't really get
05:43 - a job as a philosopher so i went to
05:46 - ireland and i'm from norway but i went
05:48 - to ireland to work for multinational
05:50 - companies and eventually all this led to
05:54 - me
05:54 - having a bit of a burnout i worked in
05:56 - sales tech support
05:59 - public service public transport support
06:00 - and so on i didn't really work jobs i
06:03 - liked i just went there to earn money
06:06 - and i became a sad panda
06:08 - and i mean it literally because
06:10 - i became a sad panda
06:13 - life in ireland just working drinking
06:17 - eating whatever i wanted was not good
06:19 - for me
06:21 - cool yeah now let's let's go to the
06:23 - learning process
06:24 - um
06:26 - when you start to learn to code it's
06:28 - like like like this picture here
06:31 - my code isn't working and i don't know
06:33 - why and if the code is working i also
06:35 - don't know why so this was always like
06:38 - when i'm was working on something it was
06:40 - always like this
06:41 - and i guess it's for most of you like
06:43 - like that when you started out learning
06:45 - to code
06:47 - for me i captured my whole learning
06:49 - experience like in these three pictures
06:51 - here uh on the first you see like github
06:54 - contributions
06:55 - um on the second you see like cheesecake
06:57 - and coffee because that's like super
06:59 - important when you program a lot
07:01 - and down here that's actually
07:03 - one hour before the gym it's actually in
07:05 - the gym
07:06 - um
07:07 - but what i wanted to tell with that
07:09 - picture is that you have to
07:11 - are you
07:12 - yeah you have to fit in
07:14 - or use every every time you get when you
07:17 - are busy when you have family studying
07:19 - working
07:20 - you don't have time for learning to code
07:23 - your whole day so when you have time
07:26 - like an hour before the gym or whatever
07:29 - or when you're traveling on the bus on
07:30 - the train use the time for coding
07:34 - and
07:34 - as you as you can see here i was like
07:37 - that's only github i was like coding
07:39 - every day like there's the challenge
07:41 - like 100 days of code
07:43 - forming a habit so it gets into your
07:46 - body
07:47 - and that's actually the result
07:50 - and that's without the free code cam
07:51 - curriculum which also looked like that
07:54 - so
07:56 - many many hours many many contributions
07:58 - and a lot of coffee and
08:00 - studying and yeah just learning to code
08:03 - um that's also like from my article as i
08:05 - said before um
08:08 - this this this tool is like wacka time
08:10 - it's like a plug-in for the editor
08:12 - it's it's for free so you can check how
08:15 - much time you actually spend
08:17 - on on projects on github and here what
08:21 - i've tracked like from
08:22 - mid what's it like from mid april april
08:26 - to mid july or in july like 250 hours i
08:30 - spent just coding so
08:32 - that that boils down to like an average
08:34 - of two hours per day so just to give you
08:37 - a perspective how much it
08:38 - can take to learn to program and to not
08:42 - be frustrated along the way
08:44 - just put in the hours
08:46 - and what you can see here also is like
08:49 - i put in or i created on codepen
08:51 - actually a small application homepage
08:54 - that actually counts the day i was
08:56 - uh
08:58 - yeah time spending coding and till this
09:01 - day it's like 380 days so that's pretty
09:03 - cool
09:04 - and what i also wanted to tell you with
09:06 - that is like to do your own projects
09:08 - always don't try to follow the
09:10 - curriculum or whatever tutorial try to
09:13 - make your own stuff happen and you will
09:14 - learn much quicker and better in general
09:18 - so
09:19 - to have it in a nutshell i put in many
09:21 - hours did a lot of research not only not
09:24 - only tutorials or videos
09:26 - or books or whatever try everything out
09:29 - see what works for you best and then go
09:31 - with it in my case it was just many
09:33 - contributions and own projects and
09:36 - always trust yourself
09:38 - but i'm going into that
09:40 - later on
09:42 - yeah yeah
09:43 - so going back to my uh
09:46 - my misconception that you had to be a
09:48 - math genius to learn to program
09:51 - to get out of this burnout and to get a
09:53 - better life i gradually tried
09:55 - to do that
09:56 - one project was me and a partner in
09:58 - norway we started a company to provide
10:00 - websites for businesses based on
10:02 - wordpress
10:03 - we never really took off we never scaled
10:05 - super high mainly because we didn't have
10:07 - enough sales but we had a few customers
10:10 - and at the point we were thinking i was
10:12 - thinking
10:13 - i was part of the technical part and my
10:15 - partner was part of the sales
10:17 - and i was thinking
10:19 - we're doing this stuff and we're just
10:20 - barely making any margin on offering
10:22 - shared host hosting for our customers
10:24 - what if we could host ourselves and i'd
10:25 - already been interested in linux for a
10:27 - while but you know how it can be with
10:28 - linux you try and you try and you fail
10:30 - and you try and you fail and you try and
10:32 - then eventually maybe you make a switch
10:34 - to linux which i have but it took a long
10:36 - while so in that process i knew it was
10:38 - possible to host yourself so i decided
10:40 - hey let's try this i tried some
10:42 - tutorials and i finally had a
10:43 - breakthrough
10:44 - when i um
10:48 - stumbled across linux academy and i took
10:51 - apart it was the first time i was using
10:53 - an online course to learn to train
10:55 - myself or to teach myself something
10:57 - and i managed to from
10:59 - knowing nothing about hosting servers
11:02 - just shared hosting
11:03 - to be able to set up a lamp stack linux
11:06 - or
11:07 - mysql and php and offer hosting for our
11:10 - customers professionally so that was a
11:12 - big hall for me but i was still thinking
11:14 - you have to be a math genius to learn
11:16 - programming figure that
11:18 - so
11:19 - this picture was to illustrate when i
11:22 - realized that hey i could learn stuff
11:23 - online then i thought let's try
11:25 - programming but it must be hard so let's
11:28 - try again i tried treehouse first just
11:30 - to brush up html and css kind of tasted
11:33 - a little bit on javascript i thought hey
11:34 - okay it's cool to learn about functions
11:36 - and variables and control statements and
11:38 - stuff but you know when does the real
11:40 - programming start so i kind of took a
11:42 - step back and it wasn't until i
11:44 - stumbled across free code camp about two
11:46 - years ago now
11:48 - um that i realized that all the stuff
11:50 - that i thought was just the basics in
11:52 - programming is programming and then you
11:55 - just have to iterate over the same
11:56 - things use them in different ways go a
11:57 - little bit more advanced into the
11:59 - language and design and other topics
12:02 - that are more like um on the
12:04 - architectural or um just get it in your
12:06 - fingers and be experienced and know what
12:08 - is the best
12:09 - choice for the for the job and so forth
12:12 - but the basics stay the same and when i
12:13 - realized that
12:16 - just imagine after about 30 years or
12:20 - you know i'm 33 now but i was probably
12:22 - around 30 done but after many years from
12:24 - a kid thinking that programming was not
12:26 - for me to finally bursting the bubble
12:29 - and thinking i can do this
12:31 - i was really motivated because i really
12:33 - wanted to do this and i saw it as a way
12:35 - out of my misery
12:37 - so then i stuck with frico camp
12:40 - as
12:41 - dalia said it can be challenging and you
12:43 - have to put in a lot of hours
12:45 - i put in a lot of work at first as many
12:47 - people do and then i fell out a little
12:49 - bit i wrote about it at my blog hello i
12:52 - love code.com
12:54 - and
12:55 - one of the things that helped me was to
12:57 - take a step back from free code camp
12:59 - read a book that is actually in the i
13:01 - saw it it's here
13:04 - eloquent javascript helped me personally
13:06 - to uh get a fresh look at free code at
13:11 - javascript not from free code camp but
13:13 - from another source i supplemented with
13:15 - other courses i like udemy because they
13:17 - have a lot of courses that you can buy
13:19 - on demand and keep for life
13:21 - and then i got back into the groove of
13:23 - record camp
13:26 - yeah so the book here is not an icon for
13:27 - something youtube started doing that's
13:29 - just because i also use books
13:32 - yeah and free code camp when we talk
13:35 - about motivation a little bit later it
13:37 - has been a constant
13:40 - part in this whole journey uh just
13:42 - knowing that i was organizing starting
13:44 - to organize the free local group here
13:46 - for the free code camp meant that i felt
13:49 - obligated to make sure i could tell the
13:52 - other people at the meet up that i had
13:53 - progresses the last time so this this
13:55 - social aspect was really helpful as well
13:59 - yeah so after learning a lot the next
14:01 - step is actually applying for a job and
14:04 - i think that's pretty interesting for us
14:06 - because our story stories are pretty
14:09 - yeah different actually
14:12 - for me just two pictures here one day
14:14 - from the interview from the day of the
14:15 - interview and another picture is also
14:18 - from the
14:19 - meetup here
14:21 - the reason why i'm putting up those
14:22 - pictures here
14:24 - just to give you an impression how how i
14:26 - looked when i was applying
14:29 - for the job
14:30 - but to
14:32 - summarize it i don't wanted to be an
14:34 - employee actually i started to go to
14:36 - become a freelancer and i was only
14:39 - focused on projects and meetups i wanted
14:42 - to get to know people and i wanted to
14:44 - build own projects
14:46 - and i tried to contribute as much as
14:48 - possible to anything code related and
14:51 - literally when i when i
14:54 - when i did realize there are meetups
14:56 - here in vienna it was my first meetup it
14:58 - was actually the web clerk's meetup here
15:00 - and i was going to everyone and
15:03 - like hi i'm daniel i'm a programmer
15:06 - beginner i don't know a lot but another
15:08 - little thing
15:09 - yeah do you have an open source project
15:11 - and if yes can i contribute and i was
15:13 - like going to everyone like hi i'm
15:15 - daniel can i contribute and then like
15:18 - you know everybody and then i met one
15:21 - guy actually benny and he said of course
15:23 - yeah i had i have an an open source
15:26 - project we can like work on it together
15:28 - and then we we met for weeks and months
15:31 - and like after i don't know four to five
15:33 - months he was like
15:35 - yeah my company is looking looking for a
15:37 - developer we have like a job offer do
15:40 - you want to work with me i was like yeah
15:42 - of course and that's actually it how i
15:44 - got the job of course there was like an
15:46 - interview and he was asking questions he
15:48 - was like yeah show me your project
15:51 - tell me a little bit about you tell me a
15:52 - little bit about your your your stack
15:55 - why do you want to do it that way et
15:57 - cetera but nothing really hard no hard
15:59 - questions
16:00 - and what i want to tell you here is
16:03 - for me up the absolute key here was to
16:06 - build a relationship to network and get
16:09 - into a job
16:11 - over a guy i already knew
16:13 - that's like super powerful because he
16:15 - can refer me
16:17 - and also like from the employer's side
16:19 - he's he's like okay he has already
16:21 - worked with one of my employees so he
16:25 - has to have something good and he trus
16:27 - the employer already trusts the other
16:29 - employee so that was like a big plus and
16:31 - that's actually for me it was actually
16:33 - pretty easy
16:36 - so on your side
16:38 - i wanted a little bit different route
16:41 - back to my work
16:43 - having a company in norway selling
16:45 - websites to companies
16:47 - i did that and i also supplemented with
16:48 - some freelance work mainly a very simple
16:51 - wordpress based task a lot of repetitive
16:53 - stuff didn't like it all so much but
16:56 - that was in the phase that i was
16:57 - starting to learn to code so as i
16:59 - learned to code i could do more code
17:01 - related stuff
17:02 - um one of the criterias for me is
17:05 - looking for a job
17:06 - i was in this freelance state but i
17:08 - wanted something full-time because the
17:09 - freelance was
17:11 - sporadic or not stable enough income for
17:13 - me
17:14 - but i wanted to look for a full-time job
17:16 - and it had to be english-speaking
17:18 - because my german is not so good if they
17:20 - would allow german they would have to be
17:21 - really
17:22 - kind people
17:25 - and then i focused on continuing to
17:27 - organize the meetup that i had started
17:29 - here and i also organized uh
17:32 - now it must be
17:34 - last year maybe node school uh in the
17:37 - summer i contacted node.js speed up and
17:39 - said hey can we do something so i helped
17:42 - do that i also helped to hacker x which
17:45 - is speed dating for developers
17:47 - have their first two events in vienna so
17:50 - i was an ambassador for them
17:52 - and i'm also the ambassador for hacker
17:53 - econ for ambassador no what's it called
17:56 - uh angelhack even though they haven't
17:58 - had something here yet i hope they will
18:00 - come soon so all these things i could
18:02 - put on my resume and i was active and i
18:04 - was in the community and i liked to
18:06 - engage and it was also something i could
18:08 - benefit from when searching for jobs
18:12 - i didn't feel when i started to send
18:14 - applications around april
18:16 - that i had enough portfolio stuff and i
18:18 - really didn't i just had a couple of
18:19 - things from free code camp and i had
18:22 - something you know when you're forking
18:23 - stuff on github and you're just putting
18:25 - down some lines in a new idea thing and
18:27 - stuff so that it looked like it was busy
18:29 - but it wasn't really much on github
18:30 - either
18:31 - but i said hey let's just try to apply
18:33 - because i have to apply and get a get a
18:35 - job let's see how this goes
18:37 - um i just had the approach that i would
18:39 - just send as many applications as i as i
18:42 - could
18:43 - uh not super many but definitely over 50
18:46 - applications in the span of april to
18:47 - august
18:48 - 50 50 50 5-0 but it doesn't have to be
18:52 - hard like you can go on sites i also
18:54 - included remote work so i can go on
18:56 - sites like weworkremotely.com and others
18:58 - for remote work find uh you know the
19:00 - ones that are looking go to their site
19:02 - you know copy paste into the form have a
19:04 - little bit of a application letter if
19:06 - you want to be personal and so on so it
19:08 - doesn't have to take so much time so i
19:10 - just try to make it a streamline as
19:12 - possible and of course apply if i really
19:15 - liked the job ad i also had a rule of it
19:18 - was if i was in doubt either if i liked
19:20 - the job or not or if the job said mid to
19:23 - senior and i was like ah or they had
19:25 - this list of requirements and i had like
19:27 - maybe 10 percent i'd be like okay you
19:29 - know what you can think as much as you
19:31 - want but if you don't apply you'll never
19:33 - know so i just made the rule i'll apply
19:35 - if i'm in doubt so
19:37 - a lot of applications um
19:40 - i had two rounds one round with a plain
19:42 - application
19:43 - black and white like i learned in school
19:45 - you should list your experience you
19:47 - should or you list your school
19:48 - experience and chronologically
19:49 - everything boring plain straightforward
19:53 - uh didn't work so well so i said okay
19:56 - let me rephrase things a little bit
19:58 - present myself as an already developer
20:00 - and not down sell myself so i changed
20:03 - some wording i presented myself better
20:04 - and i got a professionally looking
20:06 - template with a picture and some colors
20:09 - and stuff and really nice
20:11 - layout design
20:13 - and that really helps because after just
20:15 - the first few applications i got
20:16 - feedback
20:18 - it ended up that i got the job that was
20:20 - the first interview i went to
20:22 - but it took them probably two months or
20:24 - something to offer me the job
20:26 - so in the meantime i had i think four
20:29 - other interviews
20:31 - um and the interview also as daniel said
20:33 - for me it wasn't so technical it was
20:35 - more that they saw that i had the
20:36 - ability to learn that i could talk about
20:40 - the choices i'd made in terms of the
20:42 - frameworks and technologies i was using
20:44 - for my
20:46 - projects when i was learning that i was
20:48 - not just following along but was
20:50 - reflected about it and i really had
20:52 - found the passion of coding that i
20:54 - didn't know um i could do until recently
20:58 - so i think that
21:07 - yeah a short take on working at the new
21:09 - company that's very i want to keep that
21:11 - very short um
21:13 - because at first it is like it's too
21:15 - much this is too much this is literally
21:17 - how you look
21:18 - in the new company um
21:21 - because it's like of course of course
21:23 - you you will be overwhelmed um because
21:25 - there are like people more experienced
21:27 - in a field you have never worked in of
21:29 - course
21:30 - what we want to talk about here is like
21:32 - okay the company is different every
21:34 - company is different so there is no uh
21:37 - what one rule fits all uh solution here
21:41 - and what's also like important is to
21:42 - keep always the learning attitude
21:44 - because people are like
21:46 - way smarter than you probably or
21:49 - hopefully
21:50 - and you will have like failures and you
21:53 - you might not know a lot
21:55 - but with having a learning attitude
21:57 - everything will work out perfectly yeah
22:00 - and you can also lean on the stuff that
22:03 - you learned while learning to code which
22:05 - most program or hopefully all
22:07 - programmers do in their job which is
22:09 - googling if you don't know the answer
22:11 - you google and you try to figure it out
22:12 - you open 10 tabs you go through them you
22:14 - find the best answer you see if you
22:15 - learn something hopefully you don't copy
22:17 - paste everything from stack overflow
22:19 - but
22:21 - that is something that is good that you
22:23 - already have a habit of
22:25 - and definitely i was also overwhelmed i
22:27 - had the impostor syndrome i was like i'm
22:29 - not good enough for this i just they're
22:31 - gonna fire me after a month oh okay i'm
22:32 - here i'm here i'm still here in a month
22:34 - they're gonna fire me next month no i'm
22:36 - still here it's been a year now i'm
22:38 - still there so i must be doing something
22:39 - this must be doing something right
22:42 - uh yeah
22:44 - yeah
22:45 - i think that's mainly it about
22:48 - our experiences we're open for questions
22:50 - afterwards in terms of working at the
22:52 - new company
22:53 - but
22:54 - it has definitely been a challenging
22:56 - ride but
22:58 - joyful and learning experience and
23:00 - yeah
23:02 - yeah so now the takeaways
23:06 - i think this is the most important part
23:08 - of our presentation and it's also like
23:09 - the last part so
23:11 - feel free to be
23:13 - or to to pay attention to these points
23:16 - because it's like
23:18 - what we we decided is the most important
23:20 - thing
23:21 - when you start applying for job or
23:24 - getting in a new industry and for us it
23:27 - was like
23:28 - three free points actually it was like
23:30 - skills ability to learn and passion yeah
23:34 - yeah this is this is as he said
23:36 - condensing down of what we found to be
23:38 - the most important things uh obviously
23:40 - you have to have some programming skills
23:42 - you have to know uh the job that you're
23:44 - applying for
23:46 - if you can demonstrate that you have the
23:48 - ability to learn which is easier when
23:50 - you can back it up with the free code
23:52 - cam process of progress or something
23:54 - like that that's really helpful
23:56 - every employer is different some
23:57 - companies they don't really care so much
23:59 - about the ability to learn or the
24:01 - passion they want someone with years of
24:03 - experience dependable etc for every
24:05 - company it's different but in our
24:07 - experience we found that the companies
24:09 - that do accommodate and do focus on
24:11 - these three things are the ones that
24:13 - you're most likely to get a job at
24:16 - and passion as well is something i just
24:18 - want to touch on because i know that
24:20 - a lot of developers or people wanting to
24:22 - get into programming doesn't necessarily
24:25 - do it
24:26 - because they love to do it
24:29 - it's perfectly fine if you have have the
24:31 - idea that you want to change a career
24:33 - either for economic reasons or because
24:35 - you want to do something different and
24:37 - um you've seen that programming could be
24:40 - a locative field or you could have some
24:42 - freedom etc
24:44 - so you don't have to have the passion is
24:46 - what i'm going to get at um
24:48 - but we found that it helps and if you
24:50 - can communicate somehow some aspects of
24:53 - programming and development etc or the
24:55 - culture or whatever that you like and
24:57 - you can get it across in an interview
24:59 - it helps yeah so basically you have to
25:02 - find a balance between
25:04 - your skills and your ability to learn
25:06 - your passion so it has to be in balance
25:08 - or you have to provide something at
25:10 - least to convince the future employer
25:14 - yes what are the concrete actions that
25:16 - you can take to get a job
25:19 - and
25:20 - for or we concluded that
25:23 - the most important things here are
25:24 - portfolio
25:26 - network working and promoting yourself
25:28 - and actually showing up it's like that's
25:31 - like
25:32 - maybe it might be the hardest thing
25:34 - actually to do
25:35 - um so yeah you want to take on yeah um
25:39 - building a portfolio on github
25:40 - contributions i had a phone interview
25:43 - with the company
25:44 - and i was he tried this sounded like he
25:47 - had a little bit more expectations than
25:48 - what i had tried to give across in my
25:50 - resume so i was kind of like saying down
25:52 - playing it a little bit maybe i
25:54 - shouldn't have but i did and he was
25:56 - commenting oh yeah but you have so much
25:57 - stuff on your github profile i was like
26:00 - yeah yeah and i was thinking afterwards
26:02 - wow the power of just having something
26:04 - on your github profile i'm not saying
26:06 - you should just put something that is
26:08 - crap and just hope that it helps but if
26:10 - you have something on github that is
26:12 - your earnest effort to learn and you're
26:15 - active and you're contributing you're
26:17 - trying to change something in the readme
26:18 - of a big open source project that's also
26:20 - fine if you can like get a taste for the
26:23 - field all that helps
26:26 - also from reading articles or hearing
26:28 - experiences
26:30 - from others
26:31 - most hiring managers will not read your
26:33 - code they might skim a little bit and
26:35 - then they skip the rest because
26:38 - not everyone loves reading other
26:39 - people's code
26:41 - all day long
26:42 - as for the networking and promoting
26:44 - yourself there also is a point that is
26:46 - also supposed to cover the aspect of
26:48 - sending out your resumes so you don't
26:50 - have to network you don't have to go out
26:52 - there and say hey hey hey
26:54 - if you if you're not the person that
26:56 - want to
26:57 - don't feel comfortable doing that that's
26:58 - fine but then you
27:00 - make sure you send out resumes and
27:02 - applications
27:05 - the job of the application i found is to
27:07 - get yourself an interview so again just
27:10 - if in doubt just send out
27:12 - applications and
27:14 - they're the job of sending those
27:15 - applications is so you get
27:17 - invited to an interview
27:19 - so keep that in mind and in the
27:21 - interview it's the job of the
27:23 - prospective employer to decide whether
27:26 - or not you're a fit for the company
27:28 - yeah
27:29 - if i had to break it down to one single
27:32 - important feature it's like the
27:33 - portfolio because i've been asked about
27:36 - show me something not just from the
27:38 - employer future employer just friends
27:40 - whoever everybody just wants to see
27:42 - something and you should at least be
27:45 - able to
27:47 - show them something
27:48 - and as robert said before i totally
27:50 - agree on that like just showing that
27:53 - you're so that you did something at
27:55 - github is incredibly powerful it looks
27:57 - amazing and nobody nobody really dives
28:00 - into the code and says ah that's like
28:02 - that's not good
28:03 - so yeah that's it that's it for my side
28:06 - on the concrete actions
28:08 - yeah the last the last point here
28:10 - motivation because we've been asked many
28:12 - many times how to stay motivated and we
28:15 - summarize it in in three points here um
28:18 - ask yourself why
28:19 - develop a habit and trust yourself do
28:22 - you want to start
28:24 - uh yeah for me um
28:27 - the why was obvious i
28:29 - realized i had a passion for code and i
28:30 - didn't think i would ever be able to
28:32 - program so that was kind of
28:34 - just
28:35 - i got for free
28:38 - the habit was
28:40 - using free core camp with the points and
28:41 - the structure it's really nice to know
28:43 - that you have a progression towards
28:45 - something certificate or portfolio
28:47 - projects etc and it also helps as i
28:50 - mentioned earlier to come to um
28:52 - especially the free code camp meetup so
28:54 - i was you know had the social incentive
28:56 - to say hey okay i'm pushing myself a
28:57 - little bit further because i wanted to
28:59 - finish the calculator for example until
29:02 - the next meet up because if i talked
29:03 - about it at the previous meetup that i
29:05 - was working on it i should maybe have it
29:07 - finished by the next time i see the same
29:08 - people
29:10 - yeah
29:11 - and um
29:13 - yeah it's easy to adopt yourself but you
29:15 - kind of just have to uh
29:18 - push through it regardless
29:21 - for me with
29:23 - not feeling i had enough portfolio
29:24 - projects to apply i just applied anyways
29:26 - so you kind of have to push yourself a
29:28 - little bit to um
29:30 - to
29:31 - continue on
29:33 - yeah
29:34 - yeah i think it's incredibly important
29:37 - to ask yourself why and always remind
29:39 - yourself why you are on that path always
29:41 - because you will have failures you will
29:44 - have setbacks
29:45 - and then it's important to remind
29:47 - yourself why you actually on that path
29:49 - and just just look at the scene here
29:51 - right now we have like friday evening
29:54 - you could be at the bar drinking with
29:55 - friends we all have like other things to
29:57 - do but you're here everybody is here
30:00 - actually learning or connecting or
30:02 - networking so you already here and you
30:04 - know why you're here um and that's also
30:07 - like with the trust yourself part here
30:10 - it's it can be incredible difficult to
30:12 - try to start a new journey in a new
30:14 - industry people are doubting you you
30:17 - keep having rejection and failures as he
30:19 - said before like 50 times applying 50
30:22 - times
30:23 - i in previous jobs i was also like
30:24 - applying 40 50 times that's normal but
30:27 - it's like
30:28 - or maybe it isn't normal i don't know
30:30 - but
30:31 - it's incredible hard it's like rejection
30:34 - people
30:35 - don't even read your your application
30:37 - and that can be really hard so don't be
30:40 - frustrated or don't give up on that
30:41 - because i know some people here are
30:43 - applying always and they're getting
30:45 - rejected and that's just part of the
30:47 - equation that's just the part don't be
30:49 - frustrated if that happens
30:52 - and
30:53 - yeah
30:54 - yeah like the guy here with the startup
30:55 - he's also here he's here he's motivated
30:58 - he has passion for his startup so
31:01 - that's that's my point on on motivation
31:04 - trust yourself and not only the progress
31:06 - or the process is incredible hard but
31:08 - also like people or family like people
31:11 - always telling you
31:14 - stay on your path stay on your like for
31:16 - me my family expected me to be a lawyer
31:18 - and my grandmother was like ah nice a
31:20 - liar and now i'm telling her like i'm
31:22 - programming and she was and she's like
31:24 - what is programming is it like game boy
31:26 - playing or what what is that she doesn't
31:28 - really see that that's difficult and
31:30 - that's opportunities here so that's also
31:32 - like incredible or it can be incredible
31:35 - tough
31:36 - so yeah just look out for that and
31:39 - yeah stay motivated on the way do you
31:41 - have anything to add no no i think you
31:44 - said it beautifully yeah yeah motivation
31:47 - is key is key um yeah if you have any
31:49 - questions feel free to ask
31:51 - um about motivation yeah
31:54 - we want to make sure that we have uh on
31:56 - record a big thanks to free code camp
31:58 - both the local group here which consists
32:00 - of everyone here that keep coming and
32:02 - also the new faces that maybe also want
32:04 - to keep coming
32:06 - and to quincy larson's work at starting
32:09 - freecodcamp.org a couple of years ago
32:11 - and how helpful it has been for us it's
32:13 - definitely
32:14 - not sure we would have had the same path
32:16 - to getting a job if we didn't have free
32:19 - coca absolutely totally agree on that
32:22 - very good platform
32:23 - yes so for to that
32:26 - um yeah this uh if you want to so almost
32:30 - thanks for us we have our contact
32:32 - details and we also have a quite a half
32:35 - of an announcement in the next slide but
32:38 - um you can contact daniel at
32:41 - twitter github and his website other
32:44 - places as well
32:45 - same goes for me
32:47 - and as for the announcement
32:50 - we are so inspired by our journey to
32:52 - becoming
32:53 - full-time developers that we started a
32:56 - friend an organization to help others do
32:59 - the same
33:00 - it's really in the starting phases if
33:02 - you go to developer's racing i just put
33:03 - it up on a server today and it just says
33:05 - developer's rising there's nothing there
33:07 - and we have a gmail address but it will
33:09 - be changed eventually but for now uh
33:12 - keep us in mind i will also link it as
33:15 - since we are organizing through codecamp
33:17 - this local group will keep mentioning it
33:19 - if people are interested
33:21 - um the purpose is to
33:24 - support programmers in general and
33:26 - provide provide a platform of exchange
33:29 - it's actually what we have been doing
33:31 - for the last month and years even years
33:35 - but with a legal framework so and we are
33:38 - not like
33:40 - we are not tied to the free code camp
33:42 - brand so we can do much more yeah and we
33:45 - also want to explore more
33:46 - so you can expect many
33:49 - nice things to happen um yeah but and we
33:51 - also want to try and
33:53 - try out ways to help others go from
33:55 - learning to code to get a job so yeah we
33:57 - have some ideas and we'll play around
33:58 - with some stuff and if people want to
34:00 - get involved it's an organization you
34:01 - can become a member
34:03 - and
34:04 - yeah yeah also if you if you want to
34:07 - contribute and as you've seen before
34:09 - when we're talking about getting a job
34:10 - it's like contributing can be very uh
34:12 - can be very valuable um if you want to
34:15 - help out or something or contribute feel
34:17 - free to just get in touch and yeah we'll
34:20 - find something
34:21 - yes yes
34:23 - so thank you thank you thank you
34:26 - [Applause]

Cleaned transcript:

so today we are going to talk about um from selftaught programmer to job uh the reason why we are talking about that is because free code camp is actually the platform where people start to start learning to code but also to get a job in a completely new industry completely different industry that they are used to used to be or used to to work and we were asked many times to talk about our experience and we both came practically from nothing to a program a job and that's why we are talking about it today we will have a question and answer session afterwards so feel free to ask everything you'd like yes just a short roadmap what we're going to cover we will talk about our life before uh we will talk about the learning process we will talk about applying for jobs we will talk about working at the new company then this year explain the main qualities and actions to get a job actually and the last the last thing will be about motivation because people always ask how do you stay motivated on the on the way um so yeah let's let's start with our life before programming um how many of you guys actually started to program from a completely different field cool so like 50 something roughly very nice um yeah so so you guys know what it takes to like start with a completely new set of of rules and mindset in my case it was like i'm a student i'm a business law student uh i have worked in different uh business law firms tax advisory firm had different workshops and also had like entrepreneurial stuff but most of the time i was also like nonprofit worker so most of the time i was just student working and working here just working and studying my whole life so not really much programming i had no idea what html was nothing yes that's that's about me yeah and with his background in business and such i had a different background i grew up on a wet cold mountain in bergen i was raised by sheep farmers it was quite miserable at times but no that's not the real story but maybe i should control them yeah but i did grow up in or by wet mountains in bergen it's one of the rainiest cities in north and northern europe it has about 250 days of rain a year so it gets quite miserable but we strangely enough we cope and i didn't get raised by sheep farmers but we have national costumes in norway that are mainly made of wool and just pay special attention to the fact that these socks are purely made out of sheep's wool handcrafted and such so they're always a pain to put on for these occasions they go up until like here so that's nice my background back to childhood i was always the computer guy in class i always liked from the first chance i had with a dad or with a dad working in tech to uh you know bash at the keyboard or h5 or something from a commodore or macintosh or something i always found out they had or early on found out they had a love for computers i didn't take it further until then learning html making some websites i had two parents my father and my mother they got divorced whenever i was at my dad and i used to live mainly at my mom's place he had internet so i could get tutorials on how to learn html print them out go back to my you know regular home on a computer with no internet learn how to make stuff with html it was really cool but then a couple of years later i got a book java in 21 days and i was like yes but i was the kind of person who since i didn't understand why it's a system out clinton i must be a stupid guy because there can only be math geniuses understands this is esoteric type we're writing out and why it makes some stuff happen and there was no one there for me to tell me that take a step back you're not stupid this is the same for everyone in the beginning and it was the same for me also in school learning maths it was easy for me or all courses in school was easy for me up until the stage where we had sort of like equations algebra and stuff and i thought that hey up until that point i just had to be in class pay attention barely do homework i did fine but then once i had to memorize rules and just apply them i didn't understand that that was what you were going to do i thought i had to really understand what was going on because that's how it had worked for me up until that point so all this just to say that i really had enforced the myth that programming is for math geniuses only so i kind of ruled it out from that from that point on and then skipping ahead a little bit young adult life instead of going into computer school which i maybe let's just call it that which i maybe would have done if i would have not have this misconception i instead said hey let's try psychology studies didn't work out let's try to study philosophy didn't work out then i kind of prioritized student life and working instead of studying and at one point i panicked realized i couldn't really get a job as a philosopher so i went to ireland and i'm from norway but i went to ireland to work for multinational companies and eventually all this led to me having a bit of a burnout i worked in sales tech support public service public transport support and so on i didn't really work jobs i liked i just went there to earn money and i became a sad panda and i mean it literally because i became a sad panda life in ireland just working drinking eating whatever i wanted was not good for me cool yeah now let's let's go to the learning process um when you start to learn to code it's like like like this picture here my code isn't working and i don't know why and if the code is working i also don't know why so this was always like when i'm was working on something it was always like this and i guess it's for most of you like like that when you started out learning to code for me i captured my whole learning experience like in these three pictures here uh on the first you see like github contributions um on the second you see like cheesecake and coffee because that's like super important when you program a lot and down here that's actually one hour before the gym it's actually in the gym um but what i wanted to tell with that picture is that you have to are you yeah you have to fit in or use every every time you get when you are busy when you have family studying working you don't have time for learning to code your whole day so when you have time like an hour before the gym or whatever or when you're traveling on the bus on the train use the time for coding and as you as you can see here i was like that's only github i was like coding every day like there's the challenge like 100 days of code forming a habit so it gets into your body and that's actually the result and that's without the free code cam curriculum which also looked like that so many many hours many many contributions and a lot of coffee and studying and yeah just learning to code um that's also like from my article as i said before um this this this tool is like wacka time it's like a plugin for the editor it's it's for free so you can check how much time you actually spend on on projects on github and here what i've tracked like from mid what's it like from mid april april to mid july or in july like 250 hours i spent just coding so that that boils down to like an average of two hours per day so just to give you a perspective how much it can take to learn to program and to not be frustrated along the way just put in the hours and what you can see here also is like i put in or i created on codepen actually a small application homepage that actually counts the day i was uh yeah time spending coding and till this day it's like 380 days so that's pretty cool and what i also wanted to tell you with that is like to do your own projects always don't try to follow the curriculum or whatever tutorial try to make your own stuff happen and you will learn much quicker and better in general so to have it in a nutshell i put in many hours did a lot of research not only not only tutorials or videos or books or whatever try everything out see what works for you best and then go with it in my case it was just many contributions and own projects and always trust yourself but i'm going into that later on yeah yeah so going back to my uh my misconception that you had to be a math genius to learn to program to get out of this burnout and to get a better life i gradually tried to do that one project was me and a partner in norway we started a company to provide websites for businesses based on wordpress we never really took off we never scaled super high mainly because we didn't have enough sales but we had a few customers and at the point we were thinking i was thinking i was part of the technical part and my partner was part of the sales and i was thinking we're doing this stuff and we're just barely making any margin on offering shared host hosting for our customers what if we could host ourselves and i'd already been interested in linux for a while but you know how it can be with linux you try and you try and you fail and you try and you fail and you try and then eventually maybe you make a switch to linux which i have but it took a long while so in that process i knew it was possible to host yourself so i decided hey let's try this i tried some tutorials and i finally had a breakthrough when i um stumbled across linux academy and i took apart it was the first time i was using an online course to learn to train myself or to teach myself something and i managed to from knowing nothing about hosting servers just shared hosting to be able to set up a lamp stack linux or mysql and php and offer hosting for our customers professionally so that was a big hall for me but i was still thinking you have to be a math genius to learn programming figure that so this picture was to illustrate when i realized that hey i could learn stuff online then i thought let's try programming but it must be hard so let's try again i tried treehouse first just to brush up html and css kind of tasted a little bit on javascript i thought hey okay it's cool to learn about functions and variables and control statements and stuff but you know when does the real programming start so i kind of took a step back and it wasn't until i stumbled across free code camp about two years ago now um that i realized that all the stuff that i thought was just the basics in programming is programming and then you just have to iterate over the same things use them in different ways go a little bit more advanced into the language and design and other topics that are more like um on the architectural or um just get it in your fingers and be experienced and know what is the best choice for the for the job and so forth but the basics stay the same and when i realized that just imagine after about 30 years or you know i'm 33 now but i was probably around 30 done but after many years from a kid thinking that programming was not for me to finally bursting the bubble and thinking i can do this i was really motivated because i really wanted to do this and i saw it as a way out of my misery so then i stuck with frico camp as dalia said it can be challenging and you have to put in a lot of hours i put in a lot of work at first as many people do and then i fell out a little bit i wrote about it at my blog hello i love code.com and one of the things that helped me was to take a step back from free code camp read a book that is actually in the i saw it it's here eloquent javascript helped me personally to uh get a fresh look at free code at javascript not from free code camp but from another source i supplemented with other courses i like udemy because they have a lot of courses that you can buy on demand and keep for life and then i got back into the groove of record camp yeah so the book here is not an icon for something youtube started doing that's just because i also use books yeah and free code camp when we talk about motivation a little bit later it has been a constant part in this whole journey uh just knowing that i was organizing starting to organize the free local group here for the free code camp meant that i felt obligated to make sure i could tell the other people at the meet up that i had progresses the last time so this this social aspect was really helpful as well yeah so after learning a lot the next step is actually applying for a job and i think that's pretty interesting for us because our story stories are pretty yeah different actually for me just two pictures here one day from the interview from the day of the interview and another picture is also from the meetup here the reason why i'm putting up those pictures here just to give you an impression how how i looked when i was applying for the job but to summarize it i don't wanted to be an employee actually i started to go to become a freelancer and i was only focused on projects and meetups i wanted to get to know people and i wanted to build own projects and i tried to contribute as much as possible to anything code related and literally when i when i when i did realize there are meetups here in vienna it was my first meetup it was actually the web clerk's meetup here and i was going to everyone and like hi i'm daniel i'm a programmer beginner i don't know a lot but another little thing yeah do you have an open source project and if yes can i contribute and i was like going to everyone like hi i'm daniel can i contribute and then like you know everybody and then i met one guy actually benny and he said of course yeah i had i have an an open source project we can like work on it together and then we we met for weeks and months and like after i don't know four to five months he was like yeah my company is looking looking for a developer we have like a job offer do you want to work with me i was like yeah of course and that's actually it how i got the job of course there was like an interview and he was asking questions he was like yeah show me your project tell me a little bit about you tell me a little bit about your your your stack why do you want to do it that way et cetera but nothing really hard no hard questions and what i want to tell you here is for me up the absolute key here was to build a relationship to network and get into a job over a guy i already knew that's like super powerful because he can refer me and also like from the employer's side he's he's like okay he has already worked with one of my employees so he has to have something good and he trus the employer already trusts the other employee so that was like a big plus and that's actually for me it was actually pretty easy so on your side i wanted a little bit different route back to my work having a company in norway selling websites to companies i did that and i also supplemented with some freelance work mainly a very simple wordpress based task a lot of repetitive stuff didn't like it all so much but that was in the phase that i was starting to learn to code so as i learned to code i could do more code related stuff um one of the criterias for me is looking for a job i was in this freelance state but i wanted something fulltime because the freelance was sporadic or not stable enough income for me but i wanted to look for a fulltime job and it had to be englishspeaking because my german is not so good if they would allow german they would have to be really kind people and then i focused on continuing to organize the meetup that i had started here and i also organized uh now it must be last year maybe node school uh in the summer i contacted node.js speed up and said hey can we do something so i helped do that i also helped to hacker x which is speed dating for developers have their first two events in vienna so i was an ambassador for them and i'm also the ambassador for hacker econ for ambassador no what's it called uh angelhack even though they haven't had something here yet i hope they will come soon so all these things i could put on my resume and i was active and i was in the community and i liked to engage and it was also something i could benefit from when searching for jobs i didn't feel when i started to send applications around april that i had enough portfolio stuff and i really didn't i just had a couple of things from free code camp and i had something you know when you're forking stuff on github and you're just putting down some lines in a new idea thing and stuff so that it looked like it was busy but it wasn't really much on github either but i said hey let's just try to apply because i have to apply and get a get a job let's see how this goes um i just had the approach that i would just send as many applications as i as i could uh not super many but definitely over 50 applications in the span of april to august 50 50 50 50 but it doesn't have to be hard like you can go on sites i also included remote work so i can go on sites like weworkremotely.com and others for remote work find uh you know the ones that are looking go to their site you know copy paste into the form have a little bit of a application letter if you want to be personal and so on so it doesn't have to take so much time so i just try to make it a streamline as possible and of course apply if i really liked the job ad i also had a rule of it was if i was in doubt either if i liked the job or not or if the job said mid to senior and i was like ah or they had this list of requirements and i had like maybe 10 percent i'd be like okay you know what you can think as much as you want but if you don't apply you'll never know so i just made the rule i'll apply if i'm in doubt so a lot of applications um i had two rounds one round with a plain application black and white like i learned in school you should list your experience you should or you list your school experience and chronologically everything boring plain straightforward uh didn't work so well so i said okay let me rephrase things a little bit present myself as an already developer and not down sell myself so i changed some wording i presented myself better and i got a professionally looking template with a picture and some colors and stuff and really nice layout design and that really helps because after just the first few applications i got feedback it ended up that i got the job that was the first interview i went to but it took them probably two months or something to offer me the job so in the meantime i had i think four other interviews um and the interview also as daniel said for me it wasn't so technical it was more that they saw that i had the ability to learn that i could talk about the choices i'd made in terms of the frameworks and technologies i was using for my projects when i was learning that i was not just following along but was reflected about it and i really had found the passion of coding that i didn't know um i could do until recently so i think that yeah a short take on working at the new company that's very i want to keep that very short um because at first it is like it's too much this is too much this is literally how you look in the new company um because it's like of course of course you you will be overwhelmed um because there are like people more experienced in a field you have never worked in of course what we want to talk about here is like okay the company is different every company is different so there is no uh what one rule fits all uh solution here and what's also like important is to keep always the learning attitude because people are like way smarter than you probably or hopefully and you will have like failures and you you might not know a lot but with having a learning attitude everything will work out perfectly yeah and you can also lean on the stuff that you learned while learning to code which most program or hopefully all programmers do in their job which is googling if you don't know the answer you google and you try to figure it out you open 10 tabs you go through them you find the best answer you see if you learn something hopefully you don't copy paste everything from stack overflow but that is something that is good that you already have a habit of and definitely i was also overwhelmed i had the impostor syndrome i was like i'm not good enough for this i just they're gonna fire me after a month oh okay i'm here i'm here i'm still here in a month they're gonna fire me next month no i'm still here it's been a year now i'm still there so i must be doing something this must be doing something right uh yeah yeah i think that's mainly it about our experiences we're open for questions afterwards in terms of working at the new company but it has definitely been a challenging ride but joyful and learning experience and yeah yeah so now the takeaways i think this is the most important part of our presentation and it's also like the last part so feel free to be or to to pay attention to these points because it's like what we we decided is the most important thing when you start applying for job or getting in a new industry and for us it was like three free points actually it was like skills ability to learn and passion yeah yeah this is this is as he said condensing down of what we found to be the most important things uh obviously you have to have some programming skills you have to know uh the job that you're applying for if you can demonstrate that you have the ability to learn which is easier when you can back it up with the free code cam process of progress or something like that that's really helpful every employer is different some companies they don't really care so much about the ability to learn or the passion they want someone with years of experience dependable etc for every company it's different but in our experience we found that the companies that do accommodate and do focus on these three things are the ones that you're most likely to get a job at and passion as well is something i just want to touch on because i know that a lot of developers or people wanting to get into programming doesn't necessarily do it because they love to do it it's perfectly fine if you have have the idea that you want to change a career either for economic reasons or because you want to do something different and um you've seen that programming could be a locative field or you could have some freedom etc so you don't have to have the passion is what i'm going to get at um but we found that it helps and if you can communicate somehow some aspects of programming and development etc or the culture or whatever that you like and you can get it across in an interview it helps yeah so basically you have to find a balance between your skills and your ability to learn your passion so it has to be in balance or you have to provide something at least to convince the future employer yes what are the concrete actions that you can take to get a job and for or we concluded that the most important things here are portfolio network working and promoting yourself and actually showing up it's like that's like maybe it might be the hardest thing actually to do um so yeah you want to take on yeah um building a portfolio on github contributions i had a phone interview with the company and i was he tried this sounded like he had a little bit more expectations than what i had tried to give across in my resume so i was kind of like saying down playing it a little bit maybe i shouldn't have but i did and he was commenting oh yeah but you have so much stuff on your github profile i was like yeah yeah and i was thinking afterwards wow the power of just having something on your github profile i'm not saying you should just put something that is crap and just hope that it helps but if you have something on github that is your earnest effort to learn and you're active and you're contributing you're trying to change something in the readme of a big open source project that's also fine if you can like get a taste for the field all that helps also from reading articles or hearing experiences from others most hiring managers will not read your code they might skim a little bit and then they skip the rest because not everyone loves reading other people's code all day long as for the networking and promoting yourself there also is a point that is also supposed to cover the aspect of sending out your resumes so you don't have to network you don't have to go out there and say hey hey hey if you if you're not the person that want to don't feel comfortable doing that that's fine but then you make sure you send out resumes and applications the job of the application i found is to get yourself an interview so again just if in doubt just send out applications and they're the job of sending those applications is so you get invited to an interview so keep that in mind and in the interview it's the job of the prospective employer to decide whether or not you're a fit for the company yeah if i had to break it down to one single important feature it's like the portfolio because i've been asked about show me something not just from the employer future employer just friends whoever everybody just wants to see something and you should at least be able to show them something and as robert said before i totally agree on that like just showing that you're so that you did something at github is incredibly powerful it looks amazing and nobody nobody really dives into the code and says ah that's like that's not good so yeah that's it that's it for my side on the concrete actions yeah the last the last point here motivation because we've been asked many many times how to stay motivated and we summarize it in in three points here um ask yourself why develop a habit and trust yourself do you want to start uh yeah for me um the why was obvious i realized i had a passion for code and i didn't think i would ever be able to program so that was kind of just i got for free the habit was using free core camp with the points and the structure it's really nice to know that you have a progression towards something certificate or portfolio projects etc and it also helps as i mentioned earlier to come to um especially the free code camp meetup so i was you know had the social incentive to say hey okay i'm pushing myself a little bit further because i wanted to finish the calculator for example until the next meet up because if i talked about it at the previous meetup that i was working on it i should maybe have it finished by the next time i see the same people yeah and um yeah it's easy to adopt yourself but you kind of just have to uh push through it regardless for me with not feeling i had enough portfolio projects to apply i just applied anyways so you kind of have to push yourself a little bit to um to continue on yeah yeah i think it's incredibly important to ask yourself why and always remind yourself why you are on that path always because you will have failures you will have setbacks and then it's important to remind yourself why you actually on that path and just just look at the scene here right now we have like friday evening you could be at the bar drinking with friends we all have like other things to do but you're here everybody is here actually learning or connecting or networking so you already here and you know why you're here um and that's also like with the trust yourself part here it's it can be incredible difficult to try to start a new journey in a new industry people are doubting you you keep having rejection and failures as he said before like 50 times applying 50 times i in previous jobs i was also like applying 40 50 times that's normal but it's like or maybe it isn't normal i don't know but it's incredible hard it's like rejection people don't even read your your application and that can be really hard so don't be frustrated or don't give up on that because i know some people here are applying always and they're getting rejected and that's just part of the equation that's just the part don't be frustrated if that happens and yeah yeah like the guy here with the startup he's also here he's here he's motivated he has passion for his startup so that's that's my point on on motivation trust yourself and not only the progress or the process is incredible hard but also like people or family like people always telling you stay on your path stay on your like for me my family expected me to be a lawyer and my grandmother was like ah nice a liar and now i'm telling her like i'm programming and she was and she's like what is programming is it like game boy playing or what what is that she doesn't really see that that's difficult and that's opportunities here so that's also like incredible or it can be incredible tough so yeah just look out for that and yeah stay motivated on the way do you have anything to add no no i think you said it beautifully yeah yeah motivation is key is key um yeah if you have any questions feel free to ask um about motivation yeah we want to make sure that we have uh on record a big thanks to free code camp both the local group here which consists of everyone here that keep coming and also the new faces that maybe also want to keep coming and to quincy larson's work at starting freecodcamp.org a couple of years ago and how helpful it has been for us it's definitely not sure we would have had the same path to getting a job if we didn't have free coca absolutely totally agree on that very good platform yes so for to that um yeah this uh if you want to so almost thanks for us we have our contact details and we also have a quite a half of an announcement in the next slide but um you can contact daniel at twitter github and his website other places as well same goes for me and as for the announcement we are so inspired by our journey to becoming fulltime developers that we started a friend an organization to help others do the same it's really in the starting phases if you go to developer's racing i just put it up on a server today and it just says developer's rising there's nothing there and we have a gmail address but it will be changed eventually but for now uh keep us in mind i will also link it as since we are organizing through codecamp this local group will keep mentioning it if people are interested um the purpose is to support programmers in general and provide provide a platform of exchange it's actually what we have been doing for the last month and years even years but with a legal framework so and we are not like we are not tied to the free code camp brand so we can do much more yeah and we also want to explore more so you can expect many nice things to happen um yeah but and we also want to try and try out ways to help others go from learning to code to get a job so yeah we have some ideas and we'll play around with some stuff and if people want to get involved it's an organization you can become a member and yeah yeah also if you if you want to contribute and as you've seen before when we're talking about getting a job it's like contributing can be very uh can be very valuable um if you want to help out or something or contribute feel free to just get in touch and yeah we'll find something yes yes so thank you thank you thank you
