00:03 - hello and welcome to live coding with
00:08 - Jessie alright today we're not gonna do
00:14 - a whole lot of new coding we're gonna
00:17 - check out some some pull requests
00:21 - because the pool requests are adding up
00:24 - and I've been really busy so I haven't
00:29 - really had a chance to review them so
00:31 - today we're gonna review them I figure
00:32 - this would be cool to do live we've got
00:35 - a little bit of this before but some
00:39 - some of you maybe have never been in a
00:43 - position to review a pool request or try
00:45 - to work on merging them so I'm gonna try
00:48 - to do the whole process here on the
00:50 - stream this is gonna have to be a
00:53 - shorter stream so we're gonna go maybe
00:55 - about an hour long at most and it's
01:00 - early because I have meetings later on
01:02 - so I can't I can't stream my normal time
01:08 - so well I have one meeting that's going
01:10 - to be really long this afternoon and I'm
01:15 - gonna go get a haircut in about an hour
01:18 - and a half so I didn't realize that I
01:24 - had the other meeting in the afternoon
01:24 - until this morning otherwise I would
01:26 - have given you a heads up yesterday
01:28 - about the early stream
01:31 - alright so hey everybody I see some of
01:35 - you are here yeah hopefully the
01:38 - notifications worked for you all so
01:42 - let's get started let me share my screen
01:44 - and I'm just going to go through some of
01:48 - the new stuff before we get to the pull
01:51 - requests I just want to show you all the
01:57 - JavaScript
01:58 - AF website so yesterday I let you all
02:03 - know that I am now the owner of
02:05 - JavaScript on AF so I'm not sure exactly
02:10 - what I want to do with it
02:12 - long term but her should had an idea to
02:15 - make a like a discord server so her
02:18 - should set up a discourse server or
02:20 - digitalocean and so right now javascript
02:24 - RAF is pointed here so if you have any
02:28 - questions that we don't address in the
02:31 - live chat or maybe you'd like to have
02:34 - some ongoing discussion you can join go
02:38 - to JavaScript AF and join and it's
02:43 - basically like a forum like an online
02:44 - forum so that's there for now I'm
02:48 - thinking if I decide to do something
02:50 - else with JavaScript on AF then I can
02:52 - always move this to a subdomain and so
02:55 - we can keep it going but for right now I
02:59 - think this is a pretty cool thing to do
03:01 - and it will at least be useful I just
03:05 - wanted whatever we did with it to be
03:06 - useful so I think this this will be
03:09 - useful I know we have several other
03:10 - channels like we have a slack channel
03:13 - and we had something with like oh I
03:16 - think we have like three different
03:18 - things going on right now in terms of
03:22 - being able to chat so this is adding
03:26 - another thing but it's central location
03:28 - anybody can join so hopefully this will
03:32 - be you know it's not exactly that a chat
03:36 - room like slack is but hopefully it'll
03:39 - be useful so check that out javascript
03:41 - dot AF and if you have any other ideas
03:46 - for what I should do with that domain
03:47 - let me know like I said we can always do
03:52 - we can always just move this to a
03:54 - subdomain if we want to do something
03:57 - else with the main domain
04:04 - alright it looks like the notification
04:06 - didn't work for some of you it's because
04:09 - I scheduled the stream so late and I'm
04:11 - I'm sorry about that if I schedule it
04:13 - less than an hour before I'm actually
04:16 - going to stream then it seems like
04:18 - notifications don't work so we'll switch
04:24 - it
04:24 - oh yeah Harsha said that server is still
04:26 - on harshest insulation partially we can
04:29 - get it switched over to mine I don't
04:31 - want you to have to pay for that for
04:34 - that server so I actually have credit on
04:37 - digitalocean that I need to use up
04:38 - anyway it's going to expire I think in
04:40 - April so we'll get that switched over
04:49 - let me think I don't know what all the
04:54 - info you need to switch it but it's I
04:58 - think the account my main account the
05:02 - email is just Jessie Weigel at gmail.com
05:05 - let me know what other info you need to
05:08 - transfer that and then I'll just I'll
05:11 - take care of I don't know how much
05:14 - credit I have but it's it's cool I'll
05:16 - just take care of the cost of it ok cool
05:23 - her shoots gonna send me the snapshot
05:25 - then then all I'll take over but thank
05:32 - you for setting that up our shoot it was
05:34 - that was really fast setup - alright so
05:38 - we've had a lot going on in in the pool
05:42 - requests and different things on a lot
05:44 - of different projects so we're gonna
05:47 - we're gonna catch up with things now so
05:50 - just to give you a little overview so
05:56 - we've been working on mainly these three
05:59 - projects so actually there's four
06:01 - projects that we've had progress on but
06:03 - I told you all about the electron app
06:04 - yesterday and I showed you so we have
06:09 - the Resource Center as an electron hat
06:13 - and I still want to do a little bit more
06:16 - testing with it especially on on a
06:19 - Windows machine and make sure everything
06:23 - works right but so far on a Mac
06:25 - everything is perfect so
06:36 - so I just lost my train of thought I got
06:38 - a slack message and it derailed me
06:43 - that's the only way the the Resource
06:47 - Center is taken care of I really want to
06:49 - get a repo up for the bulletin to turn
06:52 - that into an electron app but we
06:54 - actually haven't finished the bulletin
06:55 - the react version of it so we were harsh
06:59 - it was doing some work on it so hard
07:02 - [ __ ] I had asked about implementing a
07:05 - Microsoft login so you knew course you
07:10 - all can follow along with this on github
07:13 - if you want all these repos Republic
07:17 - make it bigger so you can see so I had
07:20 - asked about using a Microsoft login for
07:24 - the bulletin since the university I
07:26 - worked for switched over to office 365
07:28 - about a month ago so I thought hey let's
07:33 - try that and I specifically asked
07:36 - hardship for help because he had set up
07:38 - the password 'less login system that we
07:40 - currently have running on this project
07:43 - so he went ahead and just set it up and
07:48 - I tested it unfortunately the problem is
07:52 - when you have like I work Microsoft
07:55 - account it doesn't automatically become
07:58 - a Microsoft account it doesn't I don't
08:04 - have that makes sense but like if I
08:05 - tried to log in to like Outlook calm or
08:09 - if I tried to use Microsoft to
08:11 - authenticate into something else and I
08:15 - put in my work email it would say that
08:18 - account doesn't exist so there are some
08:21 - other steps we can take to make it work
08:23 - but I think a simpler solution and one
08:27 - that will be more user friendly is that
08:30 - we're just going to check so we're going
08:32 - to keep the password this login and only
08:35 - allow logins from Franciscan GDU
08:38 - addresses and we're also going to accept
08:43 - any user that is coming from our single
08:47 - sign-on page
08:48 - because if they're there at that page it
08:50 - means that they've already signed into
08:52 - that page so we can trust that you know
08:56 - they've got there and if they got here
08:58 - there are somehow some other way I'm not
09:01 - worried about it really then we have
09:04 - bigger problems just somebody reading
09:06 - the bulletin so we're just going to use
09:11 - document dot refer which is just in
09:14 - JavaScript and it lets us get the URL of
09:18 - whatever site the user was on last
09:20 - before they came to this site you know
09:23 - whatever say it linked from so that's
09:25 - what we're gonna do still need to
09:28 - implement that I'm actually working on
09:29 - implementing that on the current version
09:31 - which is just a jQuery single page app
09:35 - that is a private repo right now I I
09:41 - don't know maybe I'll make it a public
09:42 - repo at some point but it's really kind
09:44 - of a mess of jQuery and custom routing
09:47 - with that it's using the WordPress REST
09:50 - API so I don't know for right now it's
09:54 - gonna stay private but I'm gonna try to
09:56 - implement the referrer thing I was doing
09:58 - that yesterday and then I got I had to
10:00 - go to a meeting and I couldn't finish it
10:02 - so it will be tested out before we even
10:06 - launched this react version of it so
10:09 - that's it for the react Billiton and
10:21 - well maybe I'll put a note and enclose
10:25 - this but I want to leave a note as to
10:27 - why we're closing that so we just have
10:31 - some basic stuff so Franciscan react
10:33 - this is the main Franciscan ddu website
10:38 - that we're working on and you have a
10:42 - bunch of stuff let's check on some of
10:45 - these issues first and then we'll get to
10:48 - this pull request so if you don't know
10:51 - why I am on github these are just my
10:55 - notifications so you wouldn't be able to
10:58 - see this page because these are
10:59 - notifications for all of my repositories
11:03 - you'd have to go to these repositories
11:05 - individually but material UI has gone to
11:14 - beta 30 so yeah it is our she mentions
11:21 - they're updating it quite a lot they are
11:22 - for sure I just noticed that on Twitter
11:24 - yesterday at some point and yeah it's
11:29 - crazy we're updating material ID very
11:31 - frequently which is fine it's cool as
11:36 - long as there's not a lot of breaking
11:37 - changes just have to have to check for
11:40 - that so right now this is just an issue
11:42 - if anybody wants to try to update and
11:45 - then double check the things are still
11:46 - working you know feel free to do that
11:48 - otherwise I'll get to it you know at
11:50 - some point in the near future but thanks
11:54 - our [ __ ] for for bringing that up in an
11:57 - issue I would I wanted to but it's
12:00 - possible I may have forgotten to do it
12:03 - anyway alright so I created this issue
12:08 - well 13 days ago and we wanted to add a
12:14 - search bar to the top map on that
12:19 - Franciscan site so
12:27 - Nikki took a shot at this and let's
12:32 - check out what's going on let me make
12:34 - sure that this isn't what that pool
12:36 - request was no it's not okay all right
12:40 - so let's take it [ __ ] take a look at
12:42 - what's going on here and see if we can
12:43 - sort this out I see there's there's a
12:48 - lot more activity here in the in the
12:51 - live chat I'm gonna get to that in just
12:52 - just a few minutes
13:02 - all right so I'll read this out in case
13:04 - you can't read this if the quality is
13:06 - bad or if you're just listening since I
13:09 - got stuck trying to implement this one
13:11 - everything would find until I wanted to
13:13 - add the open/close animation I added an
13:16 - is search open boolean to the state and
13:20 - wanted to change the value assigned to
13:23 - the search field class based based on
13:26 - that that boolean got flipped on the
13:31 - search icon clicked something like with
13:35 - okay changing the width with the
13:38 - transition all right
13:40 - the function with the style rules is not
13:42 - inside the component so you can't access
13:45 - the state like that there I'm attempting
13:50 - to add this animation wrong way how
13:52 - should I go about it all right I guess
14:12 - don't you what the style rules is not
14:14 - inside the component okay so the problem
14:19 - is the style rules what if if you can't
14:29 - change the style rules because of the
14:30 - function there what if you just added a
14:33 - class to the the element and that
14:38 - changed it like a class like open or
14:41 - closed and then you set instead of
14:44 - having the class be search field you can
14:48 - have a class that's open and a class
14:50 - that's closed then you should be able to
14:52 - access state and it'll switch back and
14:54 - forth between the two if if anyone else
15:00 - has another way to do that let me know
15:06 - otherwise I'm going to type this in
15:40 - mr. States
15:53 - okay let me okay
16:03 - comment on that and see and this one is
16:11 - we're gonna change color of the search
16:13 - field underlined alright so we had in
16:18 - the sidebar we have another search field
16:22 - and the color was some like neon green
16:26 - color that didn't match our palette so
16:30 - alright it looks like so Nikki had asked
16:33 - about the color but then when I had I
16:36 - think it implemented no maybe not
16:43 - or maybe I just already checked it out
16:49 - yeah it is there's an open for requests
16:51 - alright so change color search label
16:54 - winning port focus
17:05 - all right let's check so this is a good
17:10 - pool request here so the pull request is
17:15 - directly referring to one of the issues
17:19 - that I open and it's it's short it's
17:22 - focused it explains clearly what's
17:25 - changed including code samples even as a
17:30 - suggestion for potentially improving it
17:33 - now usually when I go to check a pool
17:37 - request on github I read this first and
17:42 - then I go to the the files changed and
17:45 - then I see what has actually changed so
17:49 - we can see really dealing this change is
17:52 - just a two additional classes with some
17:56 - CSS and it looks like yeah so we
18:03 - actually have the classes here now yes
18:09 - we've added the classes so those are all
18:10 - the changes when the changes are very
18:12 - small like this and the effect is
18:14 - obvious I don't bother to actually pull
18:18 - in the changes on a separate branch and
18:20 - test it so what I'm going to do is I'm
18:27 - gonna merge the pool request right here
18:30 - and I like I said I only merge like this
18:34 - if the changes are small and very
18:37 - obvious what they do so I don't
18:40 - recommend merging like this without
18:42 - testing unless you're absolutely sure of
18:45 - what's going on a very minor CSS change
18:48 - like this is fine but especially if
18:53 - somebody's bringing in like other NPM
18:55 - packages and doing things like test it
18:58 - first on a separate branch
19:04 - I always like to write a thank you
19:10 - message if you maintain something I'd
19:13 - recommend like always writing a thank
19:15 - you message it only takes a second and I
19:19 - think it's polite I like to get
19:21 - thank-you messages all right great so we
19:24 - have one full request merged and let's
19:28 - check this one out and also this one so
19:33 - this one is add links in the drawer so
19:39 - we have that side drawer let me see I
19:44 - should probably bring the site up let me
19:50 - get this site running so that we can all
19:51 - see man and I just showed my dot end
19:57 - file on on YouTube live so I'm
20:00 - definitely gonna have to change that now
20:12 - we weren't gonna end up we're gonna take
20:14 - out that functionality anyway so I can't
20:19 - believe I just did that
20:24 - let's see looking for my there it is
20:31 - okay I need to get into I'm gonna cancel
20:39 - this and grot I'm not even sure what was
20:41 - on there
20:41 - and let's start up this Franciscan site
20:50 - all right wonderful so let's bring this
21:03 - here we are so this is what we're
21:05 - talking about this sidebar and with our
21:20 - links we wanted to have some leg
21:24 - external links under here so that's what
21:27 - this pull request is talking about and
21:34 - since we did merge something in on
21:36 - github it's a good idea to pull in those
21:42 - changes
21:43 - let me find area Franciscan site let's
21:48 - move this over and
21:59 - have a change in the yarn file no all
22:03 - right
22:11 - I think yeah that's it it's just the
22:13 - yarn the unlock
22:47 - all right
23:13 - all right so I'm pulling the changes
23:15 - that we just had but it's working once
23:17 - we had emerged since I had a change in
23:19 - the lock file that I did not commit
23:31 - and it it opened automatically an atom
23:34 - on my other screen
23:57 - it's close
24:00 - all right great so that works
24:09 - okay great so now everything is up to
24:11 - date and I've already showed this so
24:18 - many times let me just I may as well
24:23 - show this we're gonna have to change all
24:28 - of this stuff which is fine because
24:31 - those are all testing things anyway
24:33 - I know I already accidentally showed it
24:40 - so that's why I just left it on anyway
24:42 - that way anybody is trying to take my
24:44 - API keys save you time from having to
24:47 - try to pause it and right at the right
24:50 - second alright I'm worried that right no
25:00 - no anyway here's what I wanted to show
25:02 - so here's what we have with the color
25:04 - change we see I said that's not bad I
25:09 - was thinking of using like this yellow
25:12 - color that we're using for this button
25:14 - but it's not too bad with the gold color
25:19 - especially since it's right up against
25:21 - this what do you what do you everybody
25:26 - think about this let me turn on an grukk
25:29 - so you all can contest it out as well
25:43 - all right we're almost coming up to
25:45 - about the halfway point the stream so
25:47 - I'm gonna take a little break and go
25:48 - back to the live chat now but I do want
25:50 - to did want to get that end grukk server
25:52 - up and running so if you can click on
25:55 - the link in the live chat now you'll be
25:57 - able to check out the site stellt let me
26:00 - know what you think about the color of
26:02 - the search bar do you think it should be
26:04 - the yellow color that we have on the the
26:07 - buttons in the that are over top the
26:10 - hero image do you think it should be a
26:12 - different color in the color palette
26:14 - like maybe the grain let me know I'm
26:18 - open to anything all right
26:24 - and yeah so let me go to the live chat
26:28 - now I'm gonna answer some questions and
26:30 - then we'll come back and we'll try to
26:31 - pull in the rest of our pull request
26:34 - handle any merge conflicts we have so we
26:36 - may end up having some conflicts here
26:39 - which I was I was kind of hoping that we
26:42 - had conflicts just to show that process
26:45 - so awesome so we will have some here
26:47 - it's it's only gonna be just within one
26:51 - of the components which shouldn't be too
26:53 - difficult but at least we'll get to see
26:56 - the process we can actually maybe we'll
27:01 - try to resolve conflicts here I don't
27:02 - think we've ever tried to do it right in
27:04 - github on the stream before we have done
27:07 - it through the command line but let's
27:09 - try to do it and github so that's what
27:11 - we'll work on next see Siberian says a F
27:21 - stands for Afghanistan or what yes a F
27:24 - does stand for Afghanistan so you know
27:26 - there's the country domains so I think
27:30 - every I believe every country has their
27:33 - own domain I'm not sure that I mean
27:36 - countries that are really new newly
27:39 - foreign may not have it but yeah dot AF
27:42 - is for Afghanistan so I actually had to
27:47 - like go on and fill out some information
27:51 - an Afghanistan like government website
27:54 - which it was kind of odd
28:01 - Candice Gander 7 says forum equals
28:04 - old-school
28:05 - yeah forums are kind of old school but I
28:07 - mean there's they're useful they still
28:09 - work
28:19 - ah let's see Aleksey says Jessie can you
28:26 - order your videos and playlists by each
28:27 - project yeah I definitely can I know
28:30 - I've been talking about it for a while I
28:32 - just haven't gotten around to do it for
28:34 - every project I think I do have it done
28:36 - for some projects maybe like project one
28:40 - and two and at least one of the projects
28:45 - I think I did I just need to get around
28:48 - to doing it for the other project so
28:50 - sorry about that
28:51 - that's one of those those things that's
28:53 - been on my mind for a while it's just
28:56 - easy to put off you know
29:07 - satya says digitalocean change the
29:09 - pricing it's cheaper now yeah yeah
29:11 - that's true so if you use digitalocean
29:14 - check it out i'm sure you've got an
29:17 - email about it but the pricing
29:18 - structures change so you get more
29:20 - powerful droplets for the same amount of
29:23 - money that you've been paying which is
29:25 - awesome and if you haven't tried out
29:27 - digitalocean now you know might be a
29:30 - good time to check it out because the
29:33 - prices are better now John John Hanson
29:41 - says that site it's not written in react
29:42 - needs a better logo with a winking face
29:46 - yeah maybe we should write a react site
29:50 - for that since we're always working with
29:53 - with react Harshit said we'll change it
29:59 - with Jessie's face haha no you don't
30:02 - have to put my face on it's the logo I
30:05 - hope those a joke oh I gotta check is it
30:11 - really gonna be my face on here I don't
30:17 - know where it went
30:18 - I thought I brought it over to show it
30:21 - but I guess I moved it back over all
30:23 - here it is it's on my other screen oh no
30:31 - it's not work you know I guess maybe
30:33 - arch is doing something on it
30:40 - let's see Harshit says document.referrer
30:43 - can't be trusted as someone can map that
30:46 - single sign-on link to their host file
30:48 - and can refer to your bulletin I I know
30:52 - the document dot refer is not secure
30:56 - right
31:00 - my goal is a very like moderate level of
31:05 - security for the bulletin so let me let
31:08 - me give you some background to explain
31:11 - the bulletin used to be a word document
31:17 - that was emailed out to everyone and
31:19 - then what happened is everyone would
31:21 - just email that out to whoever else
31:23 - wanted it so their spouses or anybody
31:27 - else in the community people who didn't
31:29 - even work here or on the email list and
31:31 - got the bulletin when I early on when I
31:35 - got here one of my first tasks was
31:38 - redoing the bulletin to make it a
31:42 - website or at least make it it was very
31:44 - vague it we just needed to make it you
31:47 - know more more interactive updated a bit
31:50 - so my guidelines were my idea was well
31:55 - there doesn't there's no reason we
31:57 - really need to make a password because
31:59 - there's not really any sensitive
32:00 - information in the bulletin and if we
32:02 - did have sensitive information we
32:04 - usually send separate special emails
32:06 - with like important in the tagline so I
32:11 - didn't think we'd need it but then we
32:17 - basically I had to so I was told I had
32:19 - to make it password-protected but there
32:22 - couldn't be any new passwords so that's
32:25 - why I came up I mean it's not like I
32:28 - invented pass for this login but that's
32:29 - why I decided on password this login
32:31 - right so I'm not worried it's not like
32:40 - we're guarding some some secrets here
32:43 - essentially we just need to have some
32:48 - semblance of this being somewhat
32:50 - protected
32:52 - just to let you know like the level that
32:54 - we're at here is that there are other
32:58 - documents that are supposed to be like
33:00 - password-protected and literally it is
33:02 - just one password that everybody in the
33:05 - whole University just has the same
33:08 - password so like you log in to an area
33:10 - and it's just in plain text on the page
33:13 - here's the password to get to this place
33:17 - so we're not like anyway well I would it
33:21 - be nice to have it be secure like that
33:23 - but to be honest with you the next time
33:25 - that I have a meeting about it which
33:27 - should be on Thursday morning I'm gonna
33:29 - really try to get it so that we don't
33:32 - even need a password at all because I I
33:37 - don't think it's necessary and I know I
33:40 - mentioned this before but like 95% of
33:42 - the emails and phone calls and visits
33:45 - that I get where people are having
33:48 - problems with things that I built are
33:50 - all about the password this login system
33:53 - for the bulletin because there are
33:57 - various things older browsers don't work
33:59 - some people will clear out their local
34:01 - storage or they have some sort of new
34:04 - program that clears out their local
34:05 - storage so things it's always the
34:09 - problem so anyway my plan is to just not
34:14 - have any password protection at all on
34:16 - this thing if possible if I can't do
34:19 - that then my backup plan is just to use
34:21 - this referrer thing that was actually
34:23 - what IT recommended to me to do when I
34:26 - asked them about integrating this with
34:28 - their single sign-on system they said do
34:30 - the refer thing my response was that's
34:33 - not really secure just like harsh it was
34:36 - saying but the more I thought about it
34:39 - more I thought well what's really the
34:41 - big deal
34:45 - my other plan is we're gonna turn the
34:48 - bulletin into a desktop app and a mobile
34:51 - app at some point just like we're doing
34:53 - with the Resource Center so potentially
34:57 - I could have that only available for
34:59 - people to download from behind
35:01 - to login so if you have that you'll just
35:06 - get access and then if other people want
35:11 - to share that file to download I mean
35:14 - that's that's out of my hands at that
35:15 - point but it'll basically be the same
35:17 - level of security we had back when it
35:19 - was a Word document being email so let
35:22 - me know what you think about that if
35:24 - anybody thinks I'm crazy or there's some
35:26 - other way to do this but that's kind of
35:30 - the situation that I have gone on with
35:33 - with that particular project
35:41 - sorry ego says we'll just see early by
35:45 - the way hello hey ebo yeah i'm really
35:47 - early I just have my normal during my
35:50 - normal stream time well what has become
35:52 - the normal which is 12 p.m. my time I
35:56 - have a haircut
35:57 - I made the appointment like before I
36:00 - started streaming at that time so that
36:03 - was unintentional that it would overlap
36:06 - with a stream and then I have another
36:08 - meeting in the afternoon that's supposed
36:10 - to be a long meeting
36:21 - and see
36:27 - david says remember Jesse triumphant
36:30 - pride precipitates a dizzying fall I
36:34 - think I think this is the third time
36:40 - that David has typed that and as always
36:43 - that is definitely true and good advice
36:46 - so thank you although usually I hear
36:53 - that same phrase quoted as pride goeth
36:56 - before the fall either way same meaning
37:06 - so anyway basically try to stay humble
37:09 - stay humble that's good advice let's see
37:20 - Gander seven said when we were talking
37:22 - about what was the issue it was with all
37:32 - with that toggle that search toggle the
37:36 - issue about how to get that animation to
37:39 - happen Gander seven says couldn't you
37:42 - pass the open closed status as a prop
37:46 - well essentially the the problem at some
37:54 - point you want it to be instincts you
37:55 - get a rerender right so I guess if it's
37:58 - as long as it exists in the state and
38:00 - some component it could be pressed down
38:02 - as a prop but I think either way the way
38:06 - that I said will work the way that you
38:09 - said could probably work as well
38:19 - let's see John Henson says the state for
38:22 - class can be a string that toggles okay
38:30 - Dacron says what does the end : after
38:34 - thing do I'm a noob and rook said it
38:37 - changes the color of the bar underneath
38:39 - the search bar yeah yeah that's
38:43 - basically what it does Rick says like
38:44 - the blue color underneath the bar when
38:46 - you type a comment here in the YouTube
38:48 - chat doctrine says el hello all the API
38:53 - keys yeah yeah all the API keys look
38:56 - says oh the those changes are in the
38:57 - same file as the previous full requests
39:00 - or the conflicts now dacron says I think
39:07 - it would not offer to merge now if
39:11 - they're conflicts what we'll just you
39:13 - have to deal with the conflicts no life
39:16 - says hi can you tell me what's wrong
39:18 - with my tribute page of code pen do you
39:20 - do such things no life send me send me
39:23 - the link oh here it is
39:28 - let's check this uh
39:45 - I let's check this tribute page out real
39:48 - quick so you want to know what's wrong
39:55 - with your tribute page I don't remember
40:00 - what all the user stories are for this
40:03 - particular free code camp thing so it
40:07 - looks okay to me I mean you have a time
40:09 - line you have an image title I mean like
40:17 - in terms of fulfilling user stories I
40:19 - think this is fine in case you're
40:21 - wondering this is one of the free code
40:23 - camp exercises that you have to do is I
40:26 - think this one's pretty early on so yeah
40:32 - I don't yeah I think it's fun let me
40:44 - know if anybody else wants to to check
40:46 - that out and give some feedback in the
40:48 - live chat you know please feel free
40:53 - Harshit says discord theme should I
40:56 - switch the light theme the dark theme
41:00 - seems too dark I don't know I kind of
41:02 - like the dark theme you know me though I
41:04 - like all the dark themed stuff but if
41:08 - you all like the light theme keep it
41:09 - light I can always just run like a
41:13 - custom script to change it dark you know
41:16 - or even maybe they'll have the option to
41:19 - do that I don't know I haven't checked
41:20 - out all the settings yet
41:42 - and see
41:45 - Eva Sisters tests take a while yeah the
41:48 - test sometimes take a lot for a minor
41:50 - change like we had when we were running
41:53 - it it does take a while but I mean
41:58 - that's it's okay tests are good to have
42:02 - so I'm willing to go through it
42:04 - sometimes they're faster than other Suns
42:11 - even if there's a field of social media
42:13 - icons are a bit too heavy on the eyes
42:15 - and the top right of the screen maybe
42:17 - spaced them out a little more alright
42:19 - let's check it out we're talking about
42:23 - these social icons yeah maybe we can
42:29 - adjust it but yeah there needs to be
42:32 - some adjustment here I think because we
42:34 - need to pull this button down off the
42:37 - top you know we don't we want to add a
42:40 - little padding up here and we could kind
42:44 - of play around with different different
42:47 - spaces between these I'd like them to be
42:55 - kind of have like a minimum size so that
42:59 - they're still clickable like reasonably
43:02 - clickable but we can kind of mess around
43:07 - with this and see what what works and
43:10 - also I had a thought I don't know why I
43:13 - didn't think about this earlier like I
43:15 - mean look at what we have right now on a
43:17 - small screen it looks terrible like
43:23 - really terrible we've basically been
43:25 - ignoring the mobile view when what we
43:27 - should have been going all along is
43:29 - working on the mobile view primarily and
43:31 - then occasionally expanding out to make
43:33 - sure it still works all right all right
43:36 - if we think about this this website is
43:38 - targeted at teenagers or is a teenager
43:42 - more likely to view this on their phone
43:44 - or just sit down at a desktop or laptop
43:47 - computer and view this I mean I I can
43:51 - look up the statistics but if I had to
43:53 - bet I'd say that a teenager is more
43:56 - likely to be on the
43:59 - their phone so we should do is as we
44:04 - continue to develop this we should do
44:06 - all development like this and then the
44:11 - desktop view should be secondary to this
44:15 - view I don't know what do y'all think
44:20 - about that I used to do all my
44:22 - development like that and I don't know
44:24 - why I got away from it probably because
44:26 - I worked on some internal projects where
44:28 - it was going to be over overwhelmingly
44:30 - viewed on a desktop and I just got used
44:35 - to that but for this project I think it
44:38 - really makes sense to do the the mobile
44:43 - view first so that's what I'm gonna
44:47 - start doing so in future streams this
44:53 - will be the default
45:03 - Aleksey says I like the golden color but
45:05 - not the yellow of the buttons eyesore
45:08 - talkin here alright so the golden color
45:11 - is good but that yellow color not good
45:13 - okay thank you for the feedback I
45:19 - appreciate that okay I just saw ours its
45:26 - message that Harsha was upgrading to
45:28 - discourse divergent version two so it
45:31 - might not might be unavailable so that's
45:35 - that's why it was unavailable briefly
45:37 - for me Devin says every tech startup
45:42 - uses dot IO and that's Indian Ocean
45:45 - domain yeah yeah you could so the dot
45:48 - eight using dot AF for something other
45:50 - than a website in Afghanistan is not
45:52 - it's not uncommon for people to use
45:55 - country code domains for other things
46:00 - right and I'm sure we've all been to a
46:02 - dot IO web site because it seems like
46:04 - every tech website now is dot IO like we
46:07 - were on code pen right now it's code
46:09 - pentaiah
46:14 - gander seven says if you click a menu
46:17 - option like academics click the grade
46:21 - Jumbotron and click the same menu item
46:24 - again it opens the sidebar with the
46:27 - submenu close yes excuse me I am aware
46:31 - of that issue and I did come up with a
46:35 - solution for it I just did not code it
46:38 - yet
46:38 - so I don't know what happened but I
46:43 - remember I was about to put to implement
46:46 - that and then I got pulled into
46:50 - something else so I needed to do that
46:53 - but thank you thank you for bringing
46:56 - that up and I'm really glad you reminded
46:58 - me because I've completely forgotten
47:00 - about it John Henson says I like the
47:05 - look of the search when clicked awesome
47:07 - awesome cool
47:11 - I will probably like right now this
47:14 - isn't centered so I want to make sure
47:18 - that that centered but other than that I
47:21 - mean that that's pretty much good to go
47:27 - Dacron says have you ever considered
47:29 - starting your own group on the side to
47:32 - take small take on small projects with
47:34 - volunteer developers I finished a boot
47:36 - camp recently I've been trying to
47:37 - improve hard time finding projects
47:41 - that's a good idea
47:43 - oh yeah I want to talk about that more
47:47 - let me know in the live chat what you
47:50 - all think so let me know number one
47:53 - would anybody be interested in something
47:55 - like that and if we were to do something
47:57 - like that how would it work would we do
48:00 - like free projects for nonprofits would
48:04 - we want to do paid projects yeah how
48:07 - would I mean I guess if we did that it
48:10 - to be almost like we were an agency but
48:12 - so I think it would be a lot easier to
48:15 - take on free projects because we
48:16 - wouldn't have to deal with all like the
48:18 - taxes and paperwork and stuff but let me
48:23 - know what you all think I'm I'm not
48:26 - entirely opposed to the idea I mean I
48:30 - guess it could operate a lot like we do
48:33 - now we could potentially have like live
48:36 - coding sessions so that everybody can be
48:38 - there checking it out explaining it and
48:41 - then have different people coding things
48:45 - and then we could maintain our
48:48 - repositories on github
48:50 - all right let me know what you all think
48:52 - though I do think that's kind of a cool
48:54 - idea and I actually already have a
48:56 - project in mind I don't I have one
49:00 - organization that could potentially be
49:02 - interested and it could eventually turn
49:05 - into something that we we would either
49:07 - sell or we could just keep it open
49:09 - source and make it available I guess let
49:15 - me know I guess I can just tell you what
49:17 - it is I don't care if anybody else tries
49:19 - it and if I think it's something that
49:21 - needs to be made by somebody
49:24 - doesn't have to be me but I I see a very
49:28 - big need for a learning management
49:29 - system that's open source that's
49:32 - reliable and fits all the criteria to be
49:35 - able to be actually used by schools you
49:39 - know there's a lot of there are stricter
49:42 - data rules about students especially
49:46 - students like under 18 at least in the
49:49 - United States so whatever we would do in
49:51 - terms of you know collecting data having
49:54 - a database we need to make sure that
49:56 - that's all in shape to be able you know
50:00 - to meet whatever standards it needs to
50:01 - but basically I wanted to be a more
50:04 - modern like full-stack JavaScript build
50:08 - it out with react I want it to be very
50:09 - fast I want it to be able to be have a
50:13 - UI for web mobile and desktop and so the
50:22 - user can use it wherever they feel most
50:23 - comfortable it definitely obviously
50:27 - needs to work Mobile on one so there are
50:32 - a lot of parts of the world where people
50:33 - only have access to a phone and not a
50:35 - desktop and their internet is not great
50:37 - so it needs to be a progressive web app
50:39 - that works well on a phone so I would
50:41 - say it needs to be like mobile first so
50:43 - like we designed the whole LMS to be
50:45 - able to work on a phone and then when
50:47 - you expand it to a desktop it basically
50:50 - just gives you more space we might be
50:52 - able to display more things but we do it
50:55 - always with a phone in mind and always
50:56 - in mind that the user doesn't have a
50:59 - good connection or is losing connection
51:01 - so this would I I'm envisioning that
51:06 - this could be used by big organizations
51:09 - that have lots of resources but it could
51:10 - also be used by small nonprofits that
51:13 - are trying to go into a country where
51:16 - they said that the internet access isn't
51:19 - good and users might have very old
51:21 - smartphones so it just needs to be
51:23 - really light weight and work offline as
51:26 - much as possible you know so user could
51:29 - take quizzes and do stuff offline as
51:31 - soon as they get any type of connection
51:32 - it'll send the data that's that's my
51:36 - thought I'd like the UI to be
51:38 - you know kind of really modern think
51:40 - like Udacity is UI or something like
51:42 - that
51:43 - Udacity use UI is built with react and
51:46 - it looks really nice I like it is it
51:50 - perfect no I mean it's not perfect but
51:52 - yeah I'm kind of thinking along those
51:54 - lines if anybody's interested in a
51:57 - project like that let me know that
51:58 - doesn't have to be a project that we do
52:00 - but I just thought you know I throw that
52:03 - idea out there I know we talked about it
52:05 - in the past but if you're it if anyone's
52:09 - interested in that I can't create a repo
52:11 - for it just using probably just use
52:16 - create react app and just start working
52:19 - on it guys so I took a long time to
52:26 - explain that let me try to get through
52:28 - alright I'm almost all the way through
52:30 - the live chat so let me get through that
52:31 - and then we'll see how much time I have
52:33 - left and in terms of getting the rest of
52:35 - this stuff merged
52:50 - no life says on how I want to know why
52:54 - the name under the quote isn't the same
52:58 - like in the example I'd have to take
53:05 - more of a closer look at it oh oh sauce
53:16 - old sauce says what is this lotion
53:20 - digitalocean is a it's like a web host
53:24 - so you can purchase they call them
53:27 - droplet droplets
53:28 - they're like little servers okay and you
53:31 - can host whatever you want on there so
53:34 - usually like they run some version of
53:37 - Linux so you have your own kind of Linux
53:41 - machine there to do whatever you want
53:42 - with when we use it to host a lot of our
53:45 - websites actually if anyone is
53:49 - interested in digitalocean
53:51 - I can give you my code if you want and I
53:55 - think you will get some free credit for
53:58 - digitalocean and I will get free credit
53:59 - I know there are other codes out there
54:01 - that'll get you more free credit so you
54:03 - don't have to use my code but if
54:05 - anyone's issue let me know send it to
54:07 - you I mean if I'm going to start hosting
54:12 - this disk or form it would be cool to
54:14 - have some X somewhere free credit
54:45 - Michael criolla us is early stars in it
54:47 - yeah for sure it's definitely an early
54:49 - start this won't be the normal time I'm
54:54 - not normally going to start at 10 a.m.
54:56 - my time
55:10 - Chris Amir asks about the github dark
55:13 - theme okay rook said he uses github dark
55:18 - first result when you google when you
55:20 - google it yeah that's exactly right
55:23 - thanks root
55:35 - rook says do you have white space on the
55:38 - right on this project on my machine I
55:40 - have a horizontal scrollbar in some
55:41 - empty space on the right side that's
55:44 - entirely possible that we have something
55:46 - like that happening
55:48 - let me see oh yeah for sure what do we
55:52 - have
55:53 - Oh up here so yeah yeah we've really
55:59 - been in my I mean I I've been ignoring
56:02 - the the mobile view and like I said I
56:07 - don't know what I was thinking this is
56:08 - obviously a project that needs to be
56:10 - made primarily with mobile view in mind
56:24 - alright doctrine says I'm totally
56:26 - interested we can do free projects we
56:28 - can do X projects I mean like experience
56:34 - projects I'm not sure with the expertise
56:37 - of radiating his experience we can do
56:40 - group freelance important part is having
56:42 - someone experienced as a lead we could
56:44 - meet on a few a week online Gander
56:49 - census I would be interested in side
56:50 - projects could start with nonprofits but
56:52 - it could be a good move get paid at some
56:55 - point a future a lot more complexity and
56:56 - paid yeah I mean I'm okay with the paid
57:00 - thing as well so I did I did do
57:04 - freelancing in the past I'm familiar
57:05 - with the contracts and billing and all
57:07 - that I I have been involved with having
57:12 - partners on freelance so I I do that I
57:17 - mean I obviously have experience with
57:19 - having projects with multiple volunteer
57:22 - contributors and in that so yeah so I'd
57:28 - be open to it if we were going to do it
57:31 - like I said I think it would be cool to
57:33 - start with some nonprofit stuff a little
57:35 - bit less pressure or maybe just some
57:36 - like side projects that are ideas for us
57:39 - maybe the less the least amount of
57:41 - pressure just to kind of get a feel for
57:43 - working with each other and then after
57:46 - that point we could do some some
57:48 - projects that might be good because then
57:50 - we actually have projects to show like
57:51 - as our portfolio if we were going to do
57:56 - that I want to make sure that we get
57:57 - like solid clients who can afford to pay
58:01 - us what we're worth right I don't I
58:03 - don't want you all getting paid nothing
58:06 - you know good projects right so we'll be
58:09 - able to use the technology that we want
58:11 - so I'm ok with that
58:15 - I dunno I know some other coders I know
58:21 - some people that can help us with the
58:23 - business end of things as well in terms
58:25 - of like handling taxes and payroll and
58:27 - all that if we wanted to I don't know if
58:33 - it should be based primarily like in the
58:35 - United States and everything goes out we
58:36 - could try to see like what's the
58:38 - the best way to set that up but I think
58:43 - about it yeah well um cool Blake says
58:46 - I'd be interested in coordinating the
58:47 - business side of things okay cool
58:49 - let's alright let's do this so first
58:51 - thing is let's just get together instead
58:53 - of talking about things and not worry
58:55 - about the the business side right away I
59:00 - don't think it'd be a good idea to just
59:01 - jump right into paying projects without
59:04 - having worked with each other at all
59:12 - old sauce is interested nick is
59:15 - interested about to finish Flatiron
59:17 - bootcamping looking to keep it free
59:19 - advice my skills cool Nick my wife just
59:23 - finished a flat iron boot camp and she
59:25 - might enroll in another one of their
59:28 - boot camps soon as well let's see
59:33 - Baccarin says react with rails back-end
59:36 - sounds like a good start okay cool yeah
59:39 - I don't have any experience at all with
59:42 - rails but I'm open to it
59:44 - Lee says Louie's sorry from pronounce
59:48 - aces lose Lu eyes II feel I see a frat
59:55 - loot this is it just Louis anyway let me
59:59 - know how to pronounce it I'm gonna stop
60:01 - messing it up I apologize but anyway
60:04 - they're interested in as well and it
60:08 - says Jesse do you have any course on
60:10 - udemy for example on a full development
60:12 - system using react node you know all
60:15 - that stuff um I don't have any courses I
60:20 - don't know if anybody honestly thinks
60:23 - that I should do a course let me know
60:26 - I'd be interested in doing that it'd
60:29 - probably take me a lot to get it
60:31 - together but I really I never really
60:35 - thought about doing it that question
60:40 - could you explain what you're teaching I
60:43 - was watching for two days but I can't
60:44 - understand okay yeah it's probably been
60:47 - a bit confusing for the last couple of
60:48 - days because we
60:49 - jumping into like different projects and
60:53 - things right in the middle of it
60:54 - so mostly so what I do on this stream is
60:58 - i stream my day-to-day work as a
61:00 - front-end developer I work for a small
61:02 - University and so whatever I need to be
61:05 - working on that day that's what I stream
61:06 - so it's not exactly tutorial and it's
61:09 - not always in in order I jump around for
61:12 - project projects sometimes some
61:14 - emergency thing comes up that I need to
61:16 - fix but when I am streaming I try to
61:19 - explain what I'm doing as best I can
61:21 - in particular right now most of our
61:23 - projects are JavaScript based we're
61:25 - using react and the design of it is
61:30 - usually based on material design and if
61:35 - you have any questions about anything
61:36 - let me know more than happy to explain
61:39 - what I'm doing go back over something so
61:41 - let me know and I'll try to help help
61:46 - you understand as much as possible but
61:48 - that's kind of like the short version of
61:50 - what we do here all right
61:53 - Harshit hat now has HTTP up and working
61:56 - for javascript AF well rook says the
62:02 - white space is there even when it's full
62:04 - screen let's check that out
62:05 - all right so you're right we do have a
62:09 - bit of white space so somewhere I have
62:12 - something producing some white space off
62:15 - to fix that I'll off hand I don't know
62:21 - what it could be but I'm sure once I
62:23 - start if I check it on dev tools it
62:25 - shouldn't be too hard to find
62:34 - doctor says let's see if this going how
62:36 - do I get in touch with you probably the
62:38 - best way dacron if you're on twitter
62:40 - just DM me on Twitter you can email me
62:44 - at Jesse waggle gmail.com if you want to
62:48 - but I like kind of prefer Twitter DM z--
62:52 - once we get into like maybe more like
62:55 - business whatever you need to talk more
62:57 - email or something else might be better
63:00 - but those two days are probably going to
63:03 - be the easiest ways to talk to me
63:10 - Michael Chris's wait what did I miss are
63:13 - you getting paid what you stream now not
63:15 - yet Michael not yet maybe one day if we
63:19 - were to do a project especially if it
63:21 - was paid the streams would move to
63:23 - probably my channel and we may not be
63:26 - able to do public streams if it's our
63:29 - own side projects I'm totally fine with
63:31 - us doing everything public but if it's
63:34 - for a paying client we definitely have
63:35 - to get them to agree to it first and I
63:38 - wouldn't want to do it on free code camp
63:40 - because free code camp does work kind of
63:43 - exclusively with volunteer stuff for
63:45 - nonprofits I could check with Quincy and
63:48 - see what he thinks
63:49 - but just to be safe I'm saying now that
63:52 - those streams would probably have to be
63:54 - on on my channel doctrine says I don't
64:03 - care about pay at the moment I'm just
64:04 - saying it for a learning experience and
64:06 - becoming a better developer that's cool
64:08 - school is
64:16 - see Harsha says now you can ask
64:18 - questions on discourse so that I will be
64:21 - personally answering them alright cool
64:22 - so hard she'll be answering questions on
64:24 - this course I'm gonna check in on
64:26 - discourse too and I can answer stuff
64:28 - anything backend related for sure I
64:31 - think harsh it's better to ask questions
64:34 - about but I'm also gonna be there to
64:40 - answer questions Louise okay is that how
64:46 - it's pronounced Louise all right Thank
64:49 - You Fabio sorry I was mispronouncing
64:52 - that let's see Christ centered EV says
64:58 - any time I inquire about the beta
65:00 - curriculum seems like people ignore the
65:02 - issue it'll be awesome if someone would
65:03 - do an update since Quincy inform people
65:06 - about the Xmas due date yes so I don't I
65:10 - don't know for sure what happened with
65:12 - the Christmas dates I never like really
65:17 - looked into that so I personally have no
65:22 - I have the same amount information as
65:24 - you all have in terms of when the beta
65:26 - curriculum is going to be out so I'm not
65:27 - involved in that project so I don't know
65:32 - why you're not getting an answer to the
65:35 - issue I think you can work on a beta
65:43 - curriculum if you want to so it is
65:46 - available trying to think you would
65:51 - usually anytime anyone ask Quincy the
65:54 - answer is always soon so I don't I think
65:57 - you probably get the same answer which
65:59 - is soon which is true I mean it's Quincy
66:01 - wants it to be good before it's released
66:05 - and you can't really put a date on that
66:09 - but I know I don't know how but I know
66:13 - it's possible to start knowing the
66:14 - curriculum now even though it's it's not
66:17 - officially like release yet does anybody
66:20 - know how to do that alright Blake's it
66:24 - gotta go watch the rest later see you
66:26 - later Blake thanks for watching Michael
66:28 - says
66:29 - if you'll take me I'm in I'm trying to
66:31 - build up a CV and anything would help
66:32 - okay cool for sure John Hanson said your
66:36 - wife is soon going to be getting a dev
66:37 - job at Google yeah I was joking I like
66:40 - my wife I had joke with my wife earlier
66:42 - and said she's gonna end up being my
66:44 - boss one day she's gonna be a project
66:46 - manager or something and but it's crazy
66:50 - she's she's been working so hard and
66:53 - learning so much
66:57 - Andrews interested in what as well
66:59 - awesome let's see a harsh said I put
67:05 - your face in the logo oh I am my face is
67:08 - there now let's see John Hanson said
67:17 - usually that whitespace is a margin or
67:19 - overflow issue yeah I often show usually
67:22 - when I have white space issues I just go
67:25 - into dev tools which that's that's great
67:29 - is too big whoops
67:31 - and I just go through and see like which
67:36 - box goes over into that white space and
67:40 - sometimes that'll do it it doesn't
67:44 - always work I assumed it would be
67:53 - something here with the header layout
67:57 - they were is that it no it's not it I'm
68:02 - not gonna have time to go through all
68:03 - this because then I won't be able to
68:04 - finish the live chat but this is like my
68:08 - my normal method of troubleshooting
68:11 - stuff like this usually I can find it
68:21 - it was a button I thought it would be
68:25 - that about this I don't know we'll see
68:34 - no life says I don't understand most of
68:36 - the time because I'm a newbie but I know
68:38 - you definitely should make some courses
68:40 - do you have some personal channel or
68:42 - only air free code camp I do have a
68:44 - personal channel so if you look in the
68:46 - description for this video there should
68:47 - be a link from my personal YouTube
68:49 - channel I only have a few videos on
68:51 - there now but I really would like to put
68:54 - some more tutorials and hopefully I
68:58 - started to put out some more videos
69:00 - recently maybe I'd like to stick to like
69:03 - one a week so if I could try to make a
69:05 - new video once a week I think that would
69:07 - be fine maybe just some short really
69:09 - focused tutorials I think my channel is
69:19 - just Jesse or Weigel I should just look
69:26 - it up with thanks I have it here I'll
69:32 - paste the link in for you all
69:35 - oh it's Jesse like a twenty nine company
69:45 - alright there we are so I pasted the
69:47 - link to my youtube channel oh okay sorry
69:58 - Brooke
69:59 - so the name is Sony key so I was saying
70:06 - Nicki I'm realize for that it's Nicki is
70:13 - that correct Nicki off to do I'll really
70:19 - try to remember that I'm sorry in the
70:21 - United States lifts how we always
70:23 - pronounce it so I apologize no life says
70:32 - sorry for my English oh don't worry
70:33 - about it your English is great
70:36 - okay so rook says beta free code camp
70:41 - org rook would you prefer on the streams
70:43 - if I say Nicki or if I just say rook
70:47 - because it doesn't matter to me either
70:49 - way but I'd rather call you what you
70:51 - like to be called our Andrew said Quincy
70:56 - said they're still cleaning it up no
70:58 - release date yet Louise says thanks for
71:06 - the answer no problem in pronunciation
71:08 - it's a Brazilian name
71:10 - I suggest you creating a udemy course on
71:14 - developing some system from scratch it
71:16 - would be great all right cool I'll
71:18 - definitely think about that I'll look
71:19 - into like the process I'd have to go
71:21 - through to do that let's see so but yeah
71:29 - beta dot free code camp tour check that
71:31 - out for the beta curriculum Michael says
71:34 - today's a live chat is kind of cool it's
71:35 - almost a group chat yeah it is it is so
71:38 - I apologize for anybody to tune in the
71:41 - stream that was expecting something a
71:42 - little different it just kind of turned
71:43 - into a chat like this which I mean it's
71:46 - fine honestly we sometimes we just don't
71:50 - stick to the topic I mean that's that's
71:52 - how it is I guess we need to do some
71:54 - something live like this but I think
71:57 - this was a
71:58 - a definitely good chat brooke says yep
72:02 - that's right but pronouncing it the
72:04 - American Way is also fine I just wanted

73:29 - we're kind of reviewing someone else's
73:30 - tribute page and actually alright I
73:35 - gotta wrap things up because I need to

74:14 - on tomorrow we'll see but thanks again
74:16 - and until tomorrow have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome to live coding with Jessie alright today we're not gonna do a whole lot of new coding we're gonna check out some some pull requests because the pool requests are adding up and I've been really busy so I haven't really had a chance to review them so today we're gonna review them I figure this would be cool to do live we've got a little bit of this before but some some of you maybe have never been in a position to review a pool request or try to work on merging them so I'm gonna try to do the whole process here on the stream this is gonna have to be a shorter stream so we're gonna go maybe about an hour long at most and it's early because I have meetings later on so I can't I can't stream my normal time so well I have one meeting that's going to be really long this afternoon and I'm gonna go get a haircut in about an hour and a half so I didn't realize that I had the other meeting in the afternoon until this morning otherwise I would have given you a heads up yesterday about the early stream alright so hey everybody I see some of you are here yeah hopefully the notifications worked for you all so let's get started let me share my screen and I'm just going to go through some of the new stuff before we get to the pull requests I just want to show you all the JavaScript AF website so yesterday I let you all know that I am now the owner of JavaScript on AF so I'm not sure exactly what I want to do with it long term but her should had an idea to make a like a discord server so her should set up a discourse server or digitalocean and so right now javascript RAF is pointed here so if you have any questions that we don't address in the live chat or maybe you'd like to have some ongoing discussion you can join go to JavaScript AF and join and it's basically like a forum like an online forum so that's there for now I'm thinking if I decide to do something else with JavaScript on AF then I can always move this to a subdomain and so we can keep it going but for right now I think this is a pretty cool thing to do and it will at least be useful I just wanted whatever we did with it to be useful so I think this this will be useful I know we have several other channels like we have a slack channel and we had something with like oh I think we have like three different things going on right now in terms of being able to chat so this is adding another thing but it's central location anybody can join so hopefully this will be you know it's not exactly that a chat room like slack is but hopefully it'll be useful so check that out javascript dot AF and if you have any other ideas for what I should do with that domain let me know like I said we can always do we can always just move this to a subdomain if we want to do something else with the main domain alright it looks like the notification didn't work for some of you it's because I scheduled the stream so late and I'm I'm sorry about that if I schedule it less than an hour before I'm actually going to stream then it seems like notifications don't work so we'll switch it oh yeah Harsha said that server is still on harshest insulation partially we can get it switched over to mine I don't want you to have to pay for that for that server so I actually have credit on digitalocean that I need to use up anyway it's going to expire I think in April so we'll get that switched over let me think I don't know what all the info you need to switch it but it's I think the account my main account the email is just Jessie Weigel at gmail.com let me know what other info you need to transfer that and then I'll just I'll take care of I don't know how much credit I have but it's it's cool I'll just take care of the cost of it ok cool her shoots gonna send me the snapshot then then all I'll take over but thank you for setting that up our shoot it was that was really fast setup alright so we've had a lot going on in in the pool requests and different things on a lot of different projects so we're gonna we're gonna catch up with things now so just to give you a little overview so we've been working on mainly these three projects so actually there's four projects that we've had progress on but I told you all about the electron app yesterday and I showed you so we have the Resource Center as an electron hat and I still want to do a little bit more testing with it especially on on a Windows machine and make sure everything works right but so far on a Mac everything is perfect so so I just lost my train of thought I got a slack message and it derailed me that's the only way the the Resource Center is taken care of I really want to get a repo up for the bulletin to turn that into an electron app but we actually haven't finished the bulletin the react version of it so we were harsh it was doing some work on it so hard [ __ ] I had asked about implementing a Microsoft login so you knew course you all can follow along with this on github if you want all these repos Republic make it bigger so you can see so I had asked about using a Microsoft login for the bulletin since the university I worked for switched over to office 365 about a month ago so I thought hey let's try that and I specifically asked hardship for help because he had set up the password 'less login system that we currently have running on this project so he went ahead and just set it up and I tested it unfortunately the problem is when you have like I work Microsoft account it doesn't automatically become a Microsoft account it doesn't I don't have that makes sense but like if I tried to log in to like Outlook calm or if I tried to use Microsoft to authenticate into something else and I put in my work email it would say that account doesn't exist so there are some other steps we can take to make it work but I think a simpler solution and one that will be more user friendly is that we're just going to check so we're going to keep the password this login and only allow logins from Franciscan GDU addresses and we're also going to accept any user that is coming from our single signon page because if they're there at that page it means that they've already signed into that page so we can trust that you know they've got there and if they got here there are somehow some other way I'm not worried about it really then we have bigger problems just somebody reading the bulletin so we're just going to use document dot refer which is just in JavaScript and it lets us get the URL of whatever site the user was on last before they came to this site you know whatever say it linked from so that's what we're gonna do still need to implement that I'm actually working on implementing that on the current version which is just a jQuery single page app that is a private repo right now I I don't know maybe I'll make it a public repo at some point but it's really kind of a mess of jQuery and custom routing with that it's using the WordPress REST API so I don't know for right now it's gonna stay private but I'm gonna try to implement the referrer thing I was doing that yesterday and then I got I had to go to a meeting and I couldn't finish it so it will be tested out before we even launched this react version of it so that's it for the react Billiton and well maybe I'll put a note and enclose this but I want to leave a note as to why we're closing that so we just have some basic stuff so Franciscan react this is the main Franciscan ddu website that we're working on and you have a bunch of stuff let's check on some of these issues first and then we'll get to this pull request so if you don't know why I am on github these are just my notifications so you wouldn't be able to see this page because these are notifications for all of my repositories you'd have to go to these repositories individually but material UI has gone to beta 30 so yeah it is our she mentions they're updating it quite a lot they are for sure I just noticed that on Twitter yesterday at some point and yeah it's crazy we're updating material ID very frequently which is fine it's cool as long as there's not a lot of breaking changes just have to have to check for that so right now this is just an issue if anybody wants to try to update and then double check the things are still working you know feel free to do that otherwise I'll get to it you know at some point in the near future but thanks our [ __ ] for for bringing that up in an issue I would I wanted to but it's possible I may have forgotten to do it anyway alright so I created this issue well 13 days ago and we wanted to add a search bar to the top map on that Franciscan site so Nikki took a shot at this and let's check out what's going on let me make sure that this isn't what that pool request was no it's not okay all right so let's take it [ __ ] take a look at what's going on here and see if we can sort this out I see there's there's a lot more activity here in the in the live chat I'm gonna get to that in just just a few minutes all right so I'll read this out in case you can't read this if the quality is bad or if you're just listening since I got stuck trying to implement this one everything would find until I wanted to add the open/close animation I added an is search open boolean to the state and wanted to change the value assigned to the search field class based based on that that boolean got flipped on the search icon clicked something like with okay changing the width with the transition all right the function with the style rules is not inside the component so you can't access the state like that there I'm attempting to add this animation wrong way how should I go about it all right I guess don't you what the style rules is not inside the component okay so the problem is the style rules what if if you can't change the style rules because of the function there what if you just added a class to the the element and that changed it like a class like open or closed and then you set instead of having the class be search field you can have a class that's open and a class that's closed then you should be able to access state and it'll switch back and forth between the two if if anyone else has another way to do that let me know otherwise I'm going to type this in mr. States okay let me okay comment on that and see and this one is we're gonna change color of the search field underlined alright so we had in the sidebar we have another search field and the color was some like neon green color that didn't match our palette so alright it looks like so Nikki had asked about the color but then when I had I think it implemented no maybe not or maybe I just already checked it out yeah it is there's an open for requests alright so change color search label winning port focus all right let's check so this is a good pool request here so the pull request is directly referring to one of the issues that I open and it's it's short it's focused it explains clearly what's changed including code samples even as a suggestion for potentially improving it now usually when I go to check a pool request on github I read this first and then I go to the the files changed and then I see what has actually changed so we can see really dealing this change is just a two additional classes with some CSS and it looks like yeah so we actually have the classes here now yes we've added the classes so those are all the changes when the changes are very small like this and the effect is obvious I don't bother to actually pull in the changes on a separate branch and test it so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna merge the pool request right here and I like I said I only merge like this if the changes are small and very obvious what they do so I don't recommend merging like this without testing unless you're absolutely sure of what's going on a very minor CSS change like this is fine but especially if somebody's bringing in like other NPM packages and doing things like test it first on a separate branch I always like to write a thank you message if you maintain something I'd recommend like always writing a thank you message it only takes a second and I think it's polite I like to get thankyou messages all right great so we have one full request merged and let's check this one out and also this one so this one is add links in the drawer so we have that side drawer let me see I should probably bring the site up let me get this site running so that we can all see man and I just showed my dot end file on on YouTube live so I'm definitely gonna have to change that now we weren't gonna end up we're gonna take out that functionality anyway so I can't believe I just did that let's see looking for my there it is okay I need to get into I'm gonna cancel this and grot I'm not even sure what was on there and let's start up this Franciscan site all right wonderful so let's bring this here we are so this is what we're talking about this sidebar and with our links we wanted to have some leg external links under here so that's what this pull request is talking about and since we did merge something in on github it's a good idea to pull in those changes let me find area Franciscan site let's move this over and have a change in the yarn file no all right I think yeah that's it it's just the yarn the unlock all right all right so I'm pulling the changes that we just had but it's working once we had emerged since I had a change in the lock file that I did not commit and it it opened automatically an atom on my other screen it's close all right great so that works okay great so now everything is up to date and I've already showed this so many times let me just I may as well show this we're gonna have to change all of this stuff which is fine because those are all testing things anyway I know I already accidentally showed it so that's why I just left it on anyway that way anybody is trying to take my API keys save you time from having to try to pause it and right at the right second alright I'm worried that right no no anyway here's what I wanted to show so here's what we have with the color change we see I said that's not bad I was thinking of using like this yellow color that we're using for this button but it's not too bad with the gold color especially since it's right up against this what do you what do you everybody think about this let me turn on an grukk so you all can contest it out as well all right we're almost coming up to about the halfway point the stream so I'm gonna take a little break and go back to the live chat now but I do want to did want to get that end grukk server up and running so if you can click on the link in the live chat now you'll be able to check out the site stellt let me know what you think about the color of the search bar do you think it should be the yellow color that we have on the the buttons in the that are over top the hero image do you think it should be a different color in the color palette like maybe the grain let me know I'm open to anything all right and yeah so let me go to the live chat now I'm gonna answer some questions and then we'll come back and we'll try to pull in the rest of our pull request handle any merge conflicts we have so we may end up having some conflicts here which I was I was kind of hoping that we had conflicts just to show that process so awesome so we will have some here it's it's only gonna be just within one of the components which shouldn't be too difficult but at least we'll get to see the process we can actually maybe we'll try to resolve conflicts here I don't think we've ever tried to do it right in github on the stream before we have done it through the command line but let's try to do it and github so that's what we'll work on next see Siberian says a F stands for Afghanistan or what yes a F does stand for Afghanistan so you know there's the country domains so I think every I believe every country has their own domain I'm not sure that I mean countries that are really new newly foreign may not have it but yeah dot AF is for Afghanistan so I actually had to like go on and fill out some information an Afghanistan like government website which it was kind of odd Candice Gander 7 says forum equals oldschool yeah forums are kind of old school but I mean there's they're useful they still work ah let's see Aleksey says Jessie can you order your videos and playlists by each project yeah I definitely can I know I've been talking about it for a while I just haven't gotten around to do it for every project I think I do have it done for some projects maybe like project one and two and at least one of the projects I think I did I just need to get around to doing it for the other project so sorry about that that's one of those those things that's been on my mind for a while it's just easy to put off you know satya says digitalocean change the pricing it's cheaper now yeah yeah that's true so if you use digitalocean check it out i'm sure you've got an email about it but the pricing structures change so you get more powerful droplets for the same amount of money that you've been paying which is awesome and if you haven't tried out digitalocean now you know might be a good time to check it out because the prices are better now John John Hanson says that site it's not written in react needs a better logo with a winking face yeah maybe we should write a react site for that since we're always working with with react Harshit said we'll change it with Jessie's face haha no you don't have to put my face on it's the logo I hope those a joke oh I gotta check is it really gonna be my face on here I don't know where it went I thought I brought it over to show it but I guess I moved it back over all here it is it's on my other screen oh no it's not work you know I guess maybe arch is doing something on it let's see Harshit says document.referrer can't be trusted as someone can map that single signon link to their host file and can refer to your bulletin I I know the document dot refer is not secure right my goal is a very like moderate level of security for the bulletin so let me let me give you some background to explain the bulletin used to be a word document that was emailed out to everyone and then what happened is everyone would just email that out to whoever else wanted it so their spouses or anybody else in the community people who didn't even work here or on the email list and got the bulletin when I early on when I got here one of my first tasks was redoing the bulletin to make it a website or at least make it it was very vague it we just needed to make it you know more more interactive updated a bit so my guidelines were my idea was well there doesn't there's no reason we really need to make a password because there's not really any sensitive information in the bulletin and if we did have sensitive information we usually send separate special emails with like important in the tagline so I didn't think we'd need it but then we basically I had to so I was told I had to make it passwordprotected but there couldn't be any new passwords so that's why I came up I mean it's not like I invented pass for this login but that's why I decided on password this login right so I'm not worried it's not like we're guarding some some secrets here essentially we just need to have some semblance of this being somewhat protected just to let you know like the level that we're at here is that there are other documents that are supposed to be like passwordprotected and literally it is just one password that everybody in the whole University just has the same password so like you log in to an area and it's just in plain text on the page here's the password to get to this place so we're not like anyway well I would it be nice to have it be secure like that but to be honest with you the next time that I have a meeting about it which should be on Thursday morning I'm gonna really try to get it so that we don't even need a password at all because I I don't think it's necessary and I know I mentioned this before but like 95% of the emails and phone calls and visits that I get where people are having problems with things that I built are all about the password this login system for the bulletin because there are various things older browsers don't work some people will clear out their local storage or they have some sort of new program that clears out their local storage so things it's always the problem so anyway my plan is to just not have any password protection at all on this thing if possible if I can't do that then my backup plan is just to use this referrer thing that was actually what IT recommended to me to do when I asked them about integrating this with their single signon system they said do the refer thing my response was that's not really secure just like harsh it was saying but the more I thought about it more I thought well what's really the big deal my other plan is we're gonna turn the bulletin into a desktop app and a mobile app at some point just like we're doing with the Resource Center so potentially I could have that only available for people to download from behind to login so if you have that you'll just get access and then if other people want to share that file to download I mean that's that's out of my hands at that point but it'll basically be the same level of security we had back when it was a Word document being email so let me know what you think about that if anybody thinks I'm crazy or there's some other way to do this but that's kind of the situation that I have gone on with with that particular project sorry ego says we'll just see early by the way hello hey ebo yeah i'm really early I just have my normal during my normal stream time well what has become the normal which is 12 p.m. my time I have a haircut I made the appointment like before I started streaming at that time so that was unintentional that it would overlap with a stream and then I have another meeting in the afternoon that's supposed to be a long meeting and see david says remember Jesse triumphant pride precipitates a dizzying fall I think I think this is the third time that David has typed that and as always that is definitely true and good advice so thank you although usually I hear that same phrase quoted as pride goeth before the fall either way same meaning so anyway basically try to stay humble stay humble that's good advice let's see Gander seven said when we were talking about what was the issue it was with all with that toggle that search toggle the issue about how to get that animation to happen Gander seven says couldn't you pass the open closed status as a prop well essentially the the problem at some point you want it to be instincts you get a rerender right so I guess if it's as long as it exists in the state and some component it could be pressed down as a prop but I think either way the way that I said will work the way that you said could probably work as well let's see John Henson says the state for class can be a string that toggles okay Dacron says what does the end after thing do I'm a noob and rook said it changes the color of the bar underneath the search bar yeah yeah that's basically what it does Rick says like the blue color underneath the bar when you type a comment here in the YouTube chat doctrine says el hello all the API keys yeah yeah all the API keys look says oh the those changes are in the same file as the previous full requests or the conflicts now dacron says I think it would not offer to merge now if they're conflicts what we'll just you have to deal with the conflicts no life says hi can you tell me what's wrong with my tribute page of code pen do you do such things no life send me send me the link oh here it is let's check this uh I let's check this tribute page out real quick so you want to know what's wrong with your tribute page I don't remember what all the user stories are for this particular free code camp thing so it looks okay to me I mean you have a time line you have an image title I mean like in terms of fulfilling user stories I think this is fine in case you're wondering this is one of the free code camp exercises that you have to do is I think this one's pretty early on so yeah I don't yeah I think it's fun let me know if anybody else wants to to check that out and give some feedback in the live chat you know please feel free Harshit says discord theme should I switch the light theme the dark theme seems too dark I don't know I kind of like the dark theme you know me though I like all the dark themed stuff but if you all like the light theme keep it light I can always just run like a custom script to change it dark you know or even maybe they'll have the option to do that I don't know I haven't checked out all the settings yet and see Eva Sisters tests take a while yeah the test sometimes take a lot for a minor change like we had when we were running it it does take a while but I mean that's it's okay tests are good to have so I'm willing to go through it sometimes they're faster than other Suns even if there's a field of social media icons are a bit too heavy on the eyes and the top right of the screen maybe spaced them out a little more alright let's check it out we're talking about these social icons yeah maybe we can adjust it but yeah there needs to be some adjustment here I think because we need to pull this button down off the top you know we don't we want to add a little padding up here and we could kind of play around with different different spaces between these I'd like them to be kind of have like a minimum size so that they're still clickable like reasonably clickable but we can kind of mess around with this and see what what works and also I had a thought I don't know why I didn't think about this earlier like I mean look at what we have right now on a small screen it looks terrible like really terrible we've basically been ignoring the mobile view when what we should have been going all along is working on the mobile view primarily and then occasionally expanding out to make sure it still works all right all right if we think about this this website is targeted at teenagers or is a teenager more likely to view this on their phone or just sit down at a desktop or laptop computer and view this I mean I I can look up the statistics but if I had to bet I'd say that a teenager is more likely to be on the their phone so we should do is as we continue to develop this we should do all development like this and then the desktop view should be secondary to this view I don't know what do y'all think about that I used to do all my development like that and I don't know why I got away from it probably because I worked on some internal projects where it was going to be over overwhelmingly viewed on a desktop and I just got used to that but for this project I think it really makes sense to do the the mobile view first so that's what I'm gonna start doing so in future streams this will be the default Aleksey says I like the golden color but not the yellow of the buttons eyesore talkin here alright so the golden color is good but that yellow color not good okay thank you for the feedback I appreciate that okay I just saw ours its message that Harsha was upgrading to discourse divergent version two so it might not might be unavailable so that's that's why it was unavailable briefly for me Devin says every tech startup uses dot IO and that's Indian Ocean domain yeah yeah you could so the dot eight using dot AF for something other than a website in Afghanistan is not it's not uncommon for people to use country code domains for other things right and I'm sure we've all been to a dot IO web site because it seems like every tech website now is dot IO like we were on code pen right now it's code pentaiah gander seven says if you click a menu option like academics click the grade Jumbotron and click the same menu item again it opens the sidebar with the submenu close yes excuse me I am aware of that issue and I did come up with a solution for it I just did not code it yet so I don't know what happened but I remember I was about to put to implement that and then I got pulled into something else so I needed to do that but thank you thank you for bringing that up and I'm really glad you reminded me because I've completely forgotten about it John Henson says I like the look of the search when clicked awesome awesome cool I will probably like right now this isn't centered so I want to make sure that that centered but other than that I mean that that's pretty much good to go Dacron says have you ever considered starting your own group on the side to take small take on small projects with volunteer developers I finished a boot camp recently I've been trying to improve hard time finding projects that's a good idea oh yeah I want to talk about that more let me know in the live chat what you all think so let me know number one would anybody be interested in something like that and if we were to do something like that how would it work would we do like free projects for nonprofits would we want to do paid projects yeah how would I mean I guess if we did that it to be almost like we were an agency but so I think it would be a lot easier to take on free projects because we wouldn't have to deal with all like the taxes and paperwork and stuff but let me know what you all think I'm I'm not entirely opposed to the idea I mean I guess it could operate a lot like we do now we could potentially have like live coding sessions so that everybody can be there checking it out explaining it and then have different people coding things and then we could maintain our repositories on github all right let me know what you all think though I do think that's kind of a cool idea and I actually already have a project in mind I don't I have one organization that could potentially be interested and it could eventually turn into something that we we would either sell or we could just keep it open source and make it available I guess let me know I guess I can just tell you what it is I don't care if anybody else tries it and if I think it's something that needs to be made by somebody doesn't have to be me but I I see a very big need for a learning management system that's open source that's reliable and fits all the criteria to be able to be actually used by schools you know there's a lot of there are stricter data rules about students especially students like under 18 at least in the United States so whatever we would do in terms of you know collecting data having a database we need to make sure that that's all in shape to be able you know to meet whatever standards it needs to but basically I wanted to be a more modern like fullstack JavaScript build it out with react I want it to be very fast I want it to be able to be have a UI for web mobile and desktop and so the user can use it wherever they feel most comfortable it definitely obviously needs to work Mobile on one so there are a lot of parts of the world where people only have access to a phone and not a desktop and their internet is not great so it needs to be a progressive web app that works well on a phone so I would say it needs to be like mobile first so like we designed the whole LMS to be able to work on a phone and then when you expand it to a desktop it basically just gives you more space we might be able to display more things but we do it always with a phone in mind and always in mind that the user doesn't have a good connection or is losing connection so this would I I'm envisioning that this could be used by big organizations that have lots of resources but it could also be used by small nonprofits that are trying to go into a country where they said that the internet access isn't good and users might have very old smartphones so it just needs to be really light weight and work offline as much as possible you know so user could take quizzes and do stuff offline as soon as they get any type of connection it'll send the data that's that's my thought I'd like the UI to be you know kind of really modern think like Udacity is UI or something like that Udacity use UI is built with react and it looks really nice I like it is it perfect no I mean it's not perfect but yeah I'm kind of thinking along those lines if anybody's interested in a project like that let me know that doesn't have to be a project that we do but I just thought you know I throw that idea out there I know we talked about it in the past but if you're it if anyone's interested in that I can't create a repo for it just using probably just use create react app and just start working on it guys so I took a long time to explain that let me try to get through alright I'm almost all the way through the live chat so let me get through that and then we'll see how much time I have left and in terms of getting the rest of this stuff merged no life says on how I want to know why the name under the quote isn't the same like in the example I'd have to take more of a closer look at it oh oh sauce old sauce says what is this lotion digitalocean is a it's like a web host so you can purchase they call them droplet droplets they're like little servers okay and you can host whatever you want on there so usually like they run some version of Linux so you have your own kind of Linux machine there to do whatever you want with when we use it to host a lot of our websites actually if anyone is interested in digitalocean I can give you my code if you want and I think you will get some free credit for digitalocean and I will get free credit I know there are other codes out there that'll get you more free credit so you don't have to use my code but if anyone's issue let me know send it to you I mean if I'm going to start hosting this disk or form it would be cool to have some X somewhere free credit Michael criolla us is early stars in it yeah for sure it's definitely an early start this won't be the normal time I'm not normally going to start at 10 a.m. my time Chris Amir asks about the github dark theme okay rook said he uses github dark first result when you google when you google it yeah that's exactly right thanks root rook says do you have white space on the right on this project on my machine I have a horizontal scrollbar in some empty space on the right side that's entirely possible that we have something like that happening let me see oh yeah for sure what do we have Oh up here so yeah yeah we've really been in my I mean I I've been ignoring the the mobile view and like I said I don't know what I was thinking this is obviously a project that needs to be made primarily with mobile view in mind alright doctrine says I'm totally interested we can do free projects we can do X projects I mean like experience projects I'm not sure with the expertise of radiating his experience we can do group freelance important part is having someone experienced as a lead we could meet on a few a week online Gander census I would be interested in side projects could start with nonprofits but it could be a good move get paid at some point a future a lot more complexity and paid yeah I mean I'm okay with the paid thing as well so I did I did do freelancing in the past I'm familiar with the contracts and billing and all that I I have been involved with having partners on freelance so I I do that I mean I obviously have experience with having projects with multiple volunteer contributors and in that so yeah so I'd be open to it if we were going to do it like I said I think it would be cool to start with some nonprofit stuff a little bit less pressure or maybe just some like side projects that are ideas for us maybe the less the least amount of pressure just to kind of get a feel for working with each other and then after that point we could do some some projects that might be good because then we actually have projects to show like as our portfolio if we were going to do that I want to make sure that we get like solid clients who can afford to pay us what we're worth right I don't I don't want you all getting paid nothing you know good projects right so we'll be able to use the technology that we want so I'm ok with that I dunno I know some other coders I know some people that can help us with the business end of things as well in terms of like handling taxes and payroll and all that if we wanted to I don't know if it should be based primarily like in the United States and everything goes out we could try to see like what's the the best way to set that up but I think about it yeah well um cool Blake says I'd be interested in coordinating the business side of things okay cool let's alright let's do this so first thing is let's just get together instead of talking about things and not worry about the the business side right away I don't think it'd be a good idea to just jump right into paying projects without having worked with each other at all old sauce is interested nick is interested about to finish Flatiron bootcamping looking to keep it free advice my skills cool Nick my wife just finished a flat iron boot camp and she might enroll in another one of their boot camps soon as well let's see Baccarin says react with rails backend sounds like a good start okay cool yeah I don't have any experience at all with rails but I'm open to it Lee says Louie's sorry from pronounce aces lose Lu eyes II feel I see a frat loot this is it just Louis anyway let me know how to pronounce it I'm gonna stop messing it up I apologize but anyway they're interested in as well and it says Jesse do you have any course on udemy for example on a full development system using react node you know all that stuff um I don't have any courses I don't know if anybody honestly thinks that I should do a course let me know I'd be interested in doing that it'd probably take me a lot to get it together but I really I never really thought about doing it that question could you explain what you're teaching I was watching for two days but I can't understand okay yeah it's probably been a bit confusing for the last couple of days because we jumping into like different projects and things right in the middle of it so mostly so what I do on this stream is i stream my daytoday work as a frontend developer I work for a small University and so whatever I need to be working on that day that's what I stream so it's not exactly tutorial and it's not always in in order I jump around for project projects sometimes some emergency thing comes up that I need to fix but when I am streaming I try to explain what I'm doing as best I can in particular right now most of our projects are JavaScript based we're using react and the design of it is usually based on material design and if you have any questions about anything let me know more than happy to explain what I'm doing go back over something so let me know and I'll try to help help you understand as much as possible but that's kind of like the short version of what we do here all right Harshit hat now has HTTP up and working for javascript AF well rook says the white space is there even when it's full screen let's check that out all right so you're right we do have a bit of white space so somewhere I have something producing some white space off to fix that I'll off hand I don't know what it could be but I'm sure once I start if I check it on dev tools it shouldn't be too hard to find doctor says let's see if this going how do I get in touch with you probably the best way dacron if you're on twitter just DM me on Twitter you can email me at Jesse waggle gmail.com if you want to but I like kind of prefer Twitter DM z once we get into like maybe more like business whatever you need to talk more email or something else might be better but those two days are probably going to be the easiest ways to talk to me Michael Chris's wait what did I miss are you getting paid what you stream now not yet Michael not yet maybe one day if we were to do a project especially if it was paid the streams would move to probably my channel and we may not be able to do public streams if it's our own side projects I'm totally fine with us doing everything public but if it's for a paying client we definitely have to get them to agree to it first and I wouldn't want to do it on free code camp because free code camp does work kind of exclusively with volunteer stuff for nonprofits I could check with Quincy and see what he thinks but just to be safe I'm saying now that those streams would probably have to be on on my channel doctrine says I don't care about pay at the moment I'm just saying it for a learning experience and becoming a better developer that's cool school is see Harsha says now you can ask questions on discourse so that I will be personally answering them alright cool so hard she'll be answering questions on this course I'm gonna check in on discourse too and I can answer stuff anything backend related for sure I think harsh it's better to ask questions about but I'm also gonna be there to answer questions Louise okay is that how it's pronounced Louise all right Thank You Fabio sorry I was mispronouncing that let's see Christ centered EV says any time I inquire about the beta curriculum seems like people ignore the issue it'll be awesome if someone would do an update since Quincy inform people about the Xmas due date yes so I don't I don't know for sure what happened with the Christmas dates I never like really looked into that so I personally have no I have the same amount information as you all have in terms of when the beta curriculum is going to be out so I'm not involved in that project so I don't know why you're not getting an answer to the issue I think you can work on a beta curriculum if you want to so it is available trying to think you would usually anytime anyone ask Quincy the answer is always soon so I don't I think you probably get the same answer which is soon which is true I mean it's Quincy wants it to be good before it's released and you can't really put a date on that but I know I don't know how but I know it's possible to start knowing the curriculum now even though it's it's not officially like release yet does anybody know how to do that alright Blake's it gotta go watch the rest later see you later Blake thanks for watching Michael says if you'll take me I'm in I'm trying to build up a CV and anything would help okay cool for sure John Hanson said your wife is soon going to be getting a dev job at Google yeah I was joking I like my wife I had joke with my wife earlier and said she's gonna end up being my boss one day she's gonna be a project manager or something and but it's crazy she's she's been working so hard and learning so much Andrews interested in what as well awesome let's see a harsh said I put your face in the logo oh I am my face is there now let's see John Hanson said usually that whitespace is a margin or overflow issue yeah I often show usually when I have white space issues I just go into dev tools which that's that's great is too big whoops and I just go through and see like which box goes over into that white space and sometimes that'll do it it doesn't always work I assumed it would be something here with the header layout they were is that it no it's not it I'm not gonna have time to go through all this because then I won't be able to finish the live chat but this is like my my normal method of troubleshooting stuff like this usually I can find it it was a button I thought it would be that about this I don't know we'll see no life says I don't understand most of the time because I'm a newbie but I know you definitely should make some courses do you have some personal channel or only air free code camp I do have a personal channel so if you look in the description for this video there should be a link from my personal YouTube channel I only have a few videos on there now but I really would like to put some more tutorials and hopefully I started to put out some more videos recently maybe I'd like to stick to like one a week so if I could try to make a new video once a week I think that would be fine maybe just some short really focused tutorials I think my channel is just Jesse or Weigel I should just look it up with thanks I have it here I'll paste the link in for you all oh it's Jesse like a twenty nine company alright there we are so I pasted the link to my youtube channel oh okay sorry Brooke so the name is Sony key so I was saying Nicki I'm realize for that it's Nicki is that correct Nicki off to do I'll really try to remember that I'm sorry in the United States lifts how we always pronounce it so I apologize no life says sorry for my English oh don't worry about it your English is great okay so rook says beta free code camp org rook would you prefer on the streams if I say Nicki or if I just say rook because it doesn't matter to
