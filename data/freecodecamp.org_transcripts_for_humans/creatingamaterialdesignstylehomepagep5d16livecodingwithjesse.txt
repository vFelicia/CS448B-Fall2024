00:06 - hey everybody
00:07 - welcome to live coding with jesse i'm
00:10 - jesse
00:12 - and happy new year
00:14 - it's 2018. so uh it's been
00:19 - a while what like a week
00:22 - week and a half since our stream
00:25 - so um
00:28 - we're going to jump back into that main
00:31 - project that we were working on so i
00:34 - have it up on the screen now
00:36 - um the
00:38 - this is what will end up being
00:40 - franciscan.edu
00:44 - uh so today
00:47 - i want to try to um
00:49 - just make a layout for the homepage
00:50 - right now
00:52 - you know we don't have much right we
00:54 - have our hero section
00:57 - but you know we kind of just threw these
00:59 - in
01:00 - i think they were just left over from
01:02 - some code that we copied in
01:05 - from a previous project
01:06 - uh so i'd like to do
01:09 - first i'd like to explain like what i'm
01:10 - thinking get your feedback on it and
01:13 - then we'll try to build it out
01:17 - we're um
01:18 - we're not going to use like any real
01:20 - data uh we'll just kind of like
01:22 - you know hard code some lorem ipsum in
01:24 - there or something i just would like to
01:27 - give my boss you know some something to
01:29 - look at like a real site
01:32 - they could scroll through and look at
01:34 - and uh and see what he thinks
01:37 - i've discussed some
01:39 - some design options with him uh before
01:42 - christmas and i made some sketches uh
01:45 - just in a notebook so that's what i'm
01:47 - gonna go from they're just they're
01:49 - really rough i haven't thought
01:50 - everything out completely uh so we'll
01:53 - we'll just test it out and see what
01:54 - works
01:57 - uh so i'm gonna check the live chat
02:00 - before we get started just to say
02:03 - say hi to everyone
02:05 - um hey everybody
02:11 - we do have a question which music app
02:14 - uh you guys use i just switched to
02:16 - google play music because spotify is not
02:18 - available in my country
02:20 - and i was able to pay for the premium
02:22 - membership using an indian credit card
02:25 - that's cool yeah um i use spotify
02:28 - i'm using spotify right now
02:31 - um
02:31 - i like spotify i definitely i enjoy the
02:34 - spotify premium so there's no
02:36 - commercials
02:38 - i've tried out google play music before
02:40 - as well
02:41 - um
02:42 - it was maybe two years ago did i tried
02:45 - it
02:47 - i think to you maybe it was only a year
02:49 - i can't remember
02:51 - um it was at least a year ago maybe more
02:54 - so i don't know what it's like now if
02:55 - it's changed a lot
02:58 - but i'm definitely happy with uh with
03:00 - spotify
03:02 - but if you don't have spotify i think
03:04 - you know google play music is good
03:07 - i always i used to listen to pandora all
03:09 - the time too
03:11 - uh you don't
03:13 - i don't know if they've changed pandora
03:14 - but i mean it's not the same as spotify
03:16 - where you can select the song you want
03:18 - it was always kind of random songs so
03:22 - a little bit different there but
03:24 - it's still nice
03:29 - okay
03:36 - oh phillip listen says uh he listens to
03:39 - music on youtube actually i used to do
03:41 - that too sometimes people put on some
03:43 - nice um like mixes on youtube
03:48 - sometimes i'd hear songs on youtube that
03:50 - i couldn't find on spotify or really
03:52 - anywhere else
03:54 - and i still have to go back to youtube
03:56 - uh to listen to it
04:00 - oh man harshit said pandora's also
04:02 - blocked there
04:05 - well i guess google music might be your
04:06 - best bet then
04:13 - all right uh one more question and then
04:15 - we'll get started
04:20 - let's see
04:22 - how would use this is from bernardo how
04:24 - would you describe the learning curve of
04:26 - react when compared to angular or view
04:28 - okay so
04:29 - i'm going to answer this question but i
04:31 - want everyone to know
04:33 - i tried to learn react
04:35 - alone like years ago so or i'm sorry i
04:38 - tried to learn angular years ago
04:41 - i was not nearly as good with javascript
04:44 - so this i don't have an equal comparison
04:46 - here but i found react a lot easier to
04:49 - learn than angular
04:51 - but
04:52 - just take that for what it what it is i
04:54 - tried to learn angular 1
04:56 - when i was just kind of new with
04:58 - javascript
05:00 - i tried to learn react
05:03 - after i had been working with javascript
05:04 - for for years
05:06 - so
05:08 - that may account for it uh for the
05:10 - difference in
05:12 - you know my ability to learn it
05:14 - um
05:15 - i have not tried out any of the newer
05:17 - versions of angular though
05:19 - so
05:20 - i don't know that my answer is really
05:22 - that helpful
05:28 - all right
05:29 - oh so uh i saw phillips comment in the
05:32 - chat reminding me so philip made a
05:35 - pomodoro clock
05:37 - a pomodoro timer here so
05:40 - we've been using uh harshit's timer
05:42 - which is awesome
05:44 - and now
05:45 - uh
05:46 - phillip
05:47 - sent me the link to this on twitter
05:50 - and uh we'll just check this out you
05:52 - know quickly before we start because
05:54 - it's cool uh so basically i mean a
05:56 - pomodoro timer is is pretty basic you
05:58 - know it needs to start a 25 minute timer
06:02 - you know you put in your breaks your
06:03 - your short and long breaks and you need
06:06 - to be able to start to stop the timer
06:07 - right
06:09 - super easy
06:11 - um
06:12 - i don't mean it's easy to build i just
06:13 - mean like the concept is easy right
06:16 - but this is a cool feature i haven't
06:18 - seen on a pomodoro timer before and
06:20 - hardship if you have this on yours
06:22 - forgive me i just haven't haven't seen
06:24 - it uh but there's a dark theme on the
06:27 - pomodoro timer and if you've watched
06:29 - this before you all know how much i like
06:32 - uh the dark themes for pretty much
06:34 - everything i mean even my office is dark
06:37 - all the time
06:39 - and uh actually the paint is you can't
06:41 - tell because the lights are off and the
06:42 - camera's not facing a wall but all the
06:45 - paint in my office is darker than
06:46 - anybody else's office
06:48 - in this building
06:49 - uh such
06:51 - i came in when it was still under
06:53 - construction and they had already
06:55 - painted it i was disappointed because i
06:57 - wanted darker colors
07:00 - and then i noticed that somebody had
07:02 - accidentally spill splattered paint all
07:04 - over the walls
07:05 - so then i got talked to the guy in
07:07 - charge of the construction and i said
07:09 - hey well you got to repaint this anyway
07:10 - right
07:11 - and so i end up getting all the dark the
07:13 - dark paint but
07:15 - anyway
07:17 - i'm sure y'all didn't
07:19 - didn't need to hear that story but
07:21 - uh
07:22 - my point was i just think the dark theme
07:24 - is cool so thanks for sharing that with
07:25 - me phillip uh that was really cool maybe
07:27 - we'll use this one today
07:29 - and uh
07:30 - we'll switch out if anybody else has any
07:32 - cool pomodoro timers that you made maybe
07:34 - we'll feature new ones
07:37 - um
07:38 - as
07:40 - as you all come up with new ones then
07:42 - just send them to me and uh as long as
07:44 - they work we use them
07:47 - wow i got a lot of activity in the live
07:48 - chat
07:51 - okay
07:53 - i want to um
07:58 - i'm just gonna uh just very briefly
08:03 - check out the live chat see if there's
08:04 - anything i should address now before we
08:06 - start
08:09 - okay pretty much a lot of talking about
08:16 - music players
08:21 - someone uh
08:24 - someone asks do i need
08:26 - to master javascript to apply for junior
08:28 - web developer job no you don't need to
08:30 - master anything to apply for a junior
08:32 - web developer
08:35 - i think um sorry i'm drinking a lot
08:39 - i have a sore throat i've been coughing
08:40 - so i don't want to like
08:42 - cough
08:43 - a lot during the stream so i i got some
08:45 - coffee here
08:48 - no i don't think you need to master
08:50 - javascript
08:52 - you just you need enough to be able to
08:54 - do what they need you to do for the job
09:01 - oh someone asked what i was drinking
09:03 - yeah it's uh coffee right now
09:13 - okay here's a question that i probably
09:15 - should answer before we start what is
09:16 - material design so i think i put it in
09:19 - the title of this video material design
09:22 - is um
09:24 - the the design
09:26 - principles i guess that
09:28 - google developed uh for for all of its
09:31 - products so if you look at a lot of
09:33 - google's products
09:36 - you um you can see
09:39 - similarities right so
09:41 - let's take a look
09:43 - just within this i mean you can see
09:46 - uh you have a certain shadow here
09:49 - to this card so their items that are in
09:52 - look like they're raised off of kind of
09:55 - the background and these are called
09:57 - cards in material design they have a
10:00 - certain shadow that makes them appear to
10:02 - be a certain height
10:04 - off of
10:06 - the um
10:07 - the background or with you know
10:10 - within material design you could call it
10:11 - the paper
10:13 - uh it has
10:14 - you know the same
10:17 - border radius
10:18 - on on everything uh the buttons behave
10:21 - the same so like there's
10:23 - it's this unified framework i don't want
10:25 - to go too much into the philosophy of it
10:28 - because i think we've covered it on
10:29 - previous streams but if you check out
10:31 - google's page on material design
10:34 - uh you'll
10:36 - they have a lot i mean there's
10:38 - pages and pages and pages of examples
10:41 - and
10:41 - you know them explaining why they do it
10:43 - this way but that's what i mean by
10:44 - material design it's it's google's
10:47 - design
10:48 - you know framework
10:51 - so that's what we're using
10:53 - and
10:59 - michael says accidentally splash paint
11:02 - was it you it was not me i did not
11:05 - splash the paint but that would have
11:06 - been a good idea but it was somebody
11:08 - else
11:16 - all right so let me get started now
11:19 - since we i've done quite a bit of
11:22 - talking here at the beginning so where's
11:24 - that timer let's use this timer
11:27 - uh so i'm going to start this pomodoro
11:29 - session i'm going to code for 25 minutes
11:33 - then i'm going to take a five minute
11:34 - break i'm going to come back to the live
11:35 - chat answering your questions so if you
11:37 - put a question in there and i haven't
11:38 - got to it yet uh please just be patient
11:41 - i will get to it
11:42 - if i can't get to everything in that
11:44 - five minute break i'll get to it at the
11:46 - end
11:47 - uh but after that five minute break
11:48 - we'll do another 25 minute session we'll
11:50 - try to get two pomodoro sessions in
11:52 - today uh and then after that we'll do
11:54 - all question and answer
11:56 - if you can't stick around to the end of
11:57 - this stream you'll be able to watch uh
12:00 - i'll answer all your questions at the
12:02 - end
12:02 - even if you're not here and you can just
12:05 - watch the recording later on the video
12:07 - will be available
12:09 - on the free code camp youtube channel
12:13 - okay
12:15 - so let me
12:17 - just just a minute or two explanation of
12:20 - of kind of what my boss and i were
12:22 - talking about
12:23 - so
12:26 - his idea was to
12:28 - have the front page be
12:30 - let's say like dynamic
12:32 - so what what he means by that is
12:37 - he wants it so that
12:38 - when you come to the page uh there's
12:40 - going to be different content there
12:42 - and
12:45 - so it won't be
12:49 - let me restart this let me start first
12:52 - of all the main target audience for this
12:55 - site for this page are going to be
12:56 - students like prospective students so
12:59 - mostly people in high school that might
13:01 - want to come
13:04 - to this university right
13:06 - all right so having said that
13:08 - the look and feel of this
13:11 - is almost gonna seem like somewhat
13:14 - i don't know i don't want to say like a
13:15 - social media thing it's because it's not
13:17 - but
13:18 - it it's almost gonna have like a
13:20 - pinterest style of lots of different
13:22 - things
13:23 - uh being there
13:26 - uh but it's gonna be
13:29 - it's gonna look more random than it
13:30 - really is
13:32 - so
13:33 - you'll see this as we get started
13:37 - uh but the idea is that people might
13:39 - have incentive to come back to
13:42 - to this site to see what's new
13:45 - but we do want to make it obvious that
13:47 - hey you can apply so like this button
13:49 - here we'll say apply now right so we
13:53 - want to make it
13:55 - the the message of the site the
13:57 - marketing message is obvious we want you
13:59 - to apply but
14:01 - there's also going to be a lot of other
14:02 - stuff that you can check out on this
14:04 - home page
14:06 - of course if you know what you want you
14:07 - can always go to the menu and go right
14:09 - to it
14:11 - all right so that's kind of the idea so
14:13 - here's how it's going to work
14:15 - i don't even know if this is worth it i
14:17 - don't think you'll be able to see the
14:18 - sketch
14:20 - no it's like
14:25 - even if you could see the sketch it's
14:26 - not very impressive so i'll just do my
14:29 - best to explain
14:31 - so what we would have is a bunch of cars
14:34 - kind of like what we have here we have
14:35 - some cars but we would have cards of
14:36 - different shapes and sizes all in here
14:38 - kind of in like
14:40 - um
14:41 - not like a grid as in everything being
14:43 - the same but you know you've seen those
14:45 - kind of like mosaic type grids where you
14:47 - have some cards will be wider or taller
14:49 - than the other cards everything just
14:51 - fits in
14:53 - that's what we're gonna have so we may
14:55 - have a large uh card here let's say
14:59 - that's a section for events and we'd
15:01 - pull the data from wherever we're
15:03 - getting our events which may be in
15:05 - wordpress maybe we're pulling it from i
15:07 - don't know like eventbrite or something
15:09 - and it would list a bunch of the events
15:11 - have some little thumbnails right
15:14 - um
15:15 - and then
15:16 - maybe in in this section we'd have two
15:18 - smaller cards
15:20 - right and one of the cards would be like
15:23 - a fact about franciscan like i don't
15:25 - know like
15:27 - 95 percent of franciscan graduates or
15:30 - like find a job within the first year i
15:31 - don't know if that's true but we would
15:33 - have some impressive sounding fact about
15:35 - franciscan there and we these could
15:37 - rotate you know we could have a custom
15:38 - post type and wordpress about franciscan
15:41 - facts
15:42 - right and
15:43 - it could we could just get a random one
15:45 - every time something like that right
15:48 - uh and then another section you know
15:50 - another card could be a video
15:53 - right video tour of one of the dorm
15:55 - rooms or something you know or or of
15:57 - campus or
15:58 - you know whatever
16:00 - um
16:01 - and then we just go down with these
16:03 - different cards so some things would
16:05 - change like obviously when you come back
16:07 - there would be different events here as
16:09 - time goes on but it would be basically
16:11 - static that you know you're always going
16:13 - to be able to find the events here
16:15 - there'd always be a fact right there but
16:17 - it may be a different one than you saw
16:19 - before
16:20 - same way there might be a video might be
16:22 - a different one
16:24 - you know potentially we could have it so
16:26 - that
16:28 - i i hate to do this because it reminds
16:30 - me of having a slider
16:32 - but possibly you could have it so people
16:34 - could click through
16:35 - and see all the different facts
16:39 - you know that's a possibility as well or
16:41 - you could have it so that there's a fact
16:44 - card here and then scroll down the page
16:45 - a little bit more and there's another
16:47 - one over here um potentially we could
16:50 - just throw in nice pictures of campus it
16:53 - could be switched in and out you know
16:55 - seasonally so that in wintertime you're
16:56 - seeing pictures of campus with snow on
16:59 - the ground
17:00 - all right
17:02 - so there's a lot of cool stuff we could
17:05 - do
17:06 - if there's a live stream going on at the
17:08 - university like not my live stream but
17:10 - sometimes they live stream events you
17:12 - know it could show up there could be a
17:14 - spot where
17:15 - if there is a live stream it's going to
17:17 - show up there
17:18 - right so that's kind of the idea i have
17:20 - no idea if it'll look right or if it'll
17:22 - work or make sense that's what we're
17:24 - going to try today
17:29 - i just glanced at the chat and saw
17:31 - philip said wordpress hearing that word
17:33 - is killing me yeah
17:35 - we're using a headless wordpress so it's
17:37 - not
17:39 - it's not like the normal wordpress that
17:41 - that everyone's used to using
17:43 - uh but we we tried to find an
17:45 - alternative and
17:47 - it's not going to happen for this
17:48 - project uh maybe down the road we'll
17:51 - have something
17:53 - all right so first thing we need to do
17:55 - is find the index file so now let's get
17:58 - into some code
18:00 - i will be using visual studio code all
18:03 - right this is a different project let's
18:05 - switch this out
18:09 - there we go
18:11 - okay
18:12 - uh we should find the index page so we
18:16 - used next
18:17 - js
18:19 - i'll um increase the font size here in
18:21 - just a second
18:23 - so we're using next to um to build this
18:27 - react site
18:28 - so next comes in with the comes with a
18:30 - built-in router and so any anything you
18:33 - put in the pages folder
18:36 - becomes a page in the site
18:38 - the home page is index.js so that's
18:41 - where we're going to go now i'm going to
18:42 - go to the home page
18:44 - and um
18:45 - right eventually these will be added in
18:47 - dynamically but for right now
18:52 - we um
18:53 - we're just going to kind of hard code a
18:55 - lot of it
18:57 - okay
18:58 - um
19:00 - we could probably leave
19:03 - some of these cards up and just modify
19:05 - them a bit
19:07 - okay let's go in here see what's what's
19:09 - going on
19:11 - um let's change this i know my boss
19:14 - wanted um
19:16 - more
19:19 - more buttons here so let's add some more
19:21 - buttons
19:23 - let's add an apply button and we want
19:28 - i think he also wanted a
19:33 - reply
19:38 - inquire and visit
19:42 - so i
19:43 - i kind of think we ought to just have
19:45 - one button i generally like having one
19:48 - instead of multiple ones so we're
19:49 - talking about this button right here
19:50 - it's called action
19:52 - um but he
19:54 - he wanted to have
19:56 - more than one so
19:58 - make this
19:59 - give this a more realistic
20:01 - aspect ratio
20:04 - um so
20:08 - we're gonna i'm gonna try it i'm gonna
20:09 - show it to him with three
20:11 - see how it looks
20:13 - let's see what happens yeah i definitely
20:15 - don't want it like that
20:18 - if we're gonna do it it's gonna be like
20:20 - this
20:23 - let's see
20:25 - we're gonna we're gonna need this grid
20:27 - in here
20:28 - uh so let's use
20:37 - we're gonna add a grid container
20:39 - component
20:46 - good and then within that
20:50 - let's bring in a great item
21:01 - and
21:06 - i'm gonna want
21:07 - three of these well let's see
21:11 - we want it to
21:14 - be on extra small uh 12 will work but
21:18 - then anything other than that yeah six
21:21 - six
21:22 - the first one we wanted to actually be
21:24 - 12 all the way up
21:26 - um and then after that we it to be
21:31 - sorry let me explain this a little bit
21:32 - more the grid system is based on 12
21:35 - column layout so if we want it to be
21:37 - full width we put 12 so on extra small
21:39 - screens it's going to be full width 12
21:41 - columns
21:44 - on small screens and up it's going to be
21:47 - half width six columns
21:49 - so
21:50 - i'm going to make
21:52 - a grid here and for this one
21:55 - this top portion of the grid
21:59 - it's going to be like this otherwise
22:02 - we're going to stick with these
22:04 - so
22:06 - i'm going to add in our buttons here
22:12 - and we actually need
22:17 - automatically changed it for me
22:20 - um
22:23 - let's see
22:24 - what's up with these lines is it just
22:26 - indentation yeah it is okay
22:28 - um
22:31 - so the main button that i want
22:33 - users to see is going to be the largest
22:36 - button
22:44 - and then let's put that visit button in
22:46 - here as well
22:54 - and let's get rid of these slashes
23:01 - okay if any of this is kind of confusing
23:03 - to you let me know in the live chat and
23:06 - then when we have our break i'll see it
23:08 - and i can go back over
23:10 - and uh try to explain some of it
23:13 - i messed up my indentation somewhere
23:18 - okay let's just say that see
23:21 - whoa
23:23 - what did i do
23:35 - all right this is all just indentations
23:37 - though
23:43 - all right
23:44 - let's see
23:46 - grid container
23:53 - all right let's get back over and see
23:56 - uh
23:57 - this should not be
24:08 - that's pretty weird
24:10 - um
24:19 - let's see what's going on
24:21 - we are using the latest version of
24:24 - material ui for our layout
24:28 - so
24:30 - i still don't have
24:34 - a familiarity with with that version of
24:36 - material ui
24:38 - uh to know just offhand what to do
24:41 - so i'll have to look up some things
24:43 - which is not not the end of the world
24:56 - i'm just trying to see
24:58 - okay
24:59 - all right i see what's happening now
25:03 - all right that makes sense
25:05 - okay so here's what's happening uh the
25:07 - grid container component is taking up
25:10 - the full width here
25:11 - uh this button is
25:14 - um taking up full width uh so
25:20 - you can see
25:23 - it's going to show it all right yeah so
25:25 - this
25:26 - container for that button you can see is
25:28 - full width uh so
25:31 - let's um
25:34 - let's just try
25:35 - change this up a bit let's see what we
25:37 - have here
25:38 - um layouts
25:48 - see what we have display flex selenium
26:08 - uh
26:20 - all right
26:21 - let's see what we should we can change
26:31 - okay let me get some suggestions here in
26:34 - the live chat let's check that out
26:45 - uh
26:48 - meyer or mayor is saying make it inline
26:51 - rook saying justify content center on
26:54 - the flex container
26:58 - okay
27:04 - we have justify content center on
27:07 - on this container
27:10 - here
27:11 - which is
27:13 - that's that parallax section right
27:16 - where is this in
27:36 - okay rook saying on the parent of the
27:38 - button
27:41 - to uh center okay
27:43 - uh let's do that then
27:45 - we're gonna say
27:46 - classes container
27:54 - all right so let's add
27:57 - on these grid items
28:05 - let's do a class name
28:08 - and
28:12 - oops
28:15 - classes
28:18 - dots
28:21 - hero
28:23 - button
28:25 - and then up here
28:27 - let's make uh
28:31 - hero button class whoops
28:36 - and
28:37 - we'll do
28:38 - justify content
28:41 - center
28:46 - center
28:53 - okay
28:54 - so if this looks weird to you
28:56 - uh it looks kind of like css but it's
28:59 - not really css
29:01 - uh that's because
29:02 - oops what did i do i messed something up
29:05 - down here
29:08 - for some reason i added a square bracket
29:14 - there we go
29:19 - work says add display flex as well
29:27 - oh display flex
29:29 - all right so
29:32 - within uh react there are many different
29:34 - ways to do
29:36 - uh css
29:39 - uh i messed it up again
29:43 - that's why so i i meant to put in
29:46 - equals and instead i put in a square
29:49 - bracket and then i took out the square
29:51 - bracket but didn't put the equal sign
29:52 - back in
29:53 - okay
29:57 - so anyway this is one of the ways that
30:00 - you can do css
30:02 - so you make a javascript object
30:06 - and you you give it
30:09 - it it looks kind of like css right so
30:12 - we have our classes so we have a class
30:14 - called parallax and then within that
30:16 - class we have all our properties here
30:19 - and our values
30:20 - right so it looks somewhat familiar but
30:23 - the syntax is just a bit different it's
30:25 - the same syntax you'd use in a normal
30:27 - javascript object
30:29 - right so
30:31 - we have to camel
30:33 - case um all of our our properties
30:39 - then
30:40 - inside here we could
30:42 - do things like we normally would right
30:44 - because these are all strings
30:48 - so that's how we're doing and then when
30:50 - we go to apply this we're going to say
30:51 - class name
30:53 - classes.parallax
30:54 - okay that's one way you could do it
30:57 - you can see you know in in the previous
31:00 - streams we've tried out
31:01 - you know several different ways of doing
31:03 - things
31:06 - in fact even within this project we're
31:08 - doing things like kind of a normal css
31:10 - way here
31:12 - we worked on this um maybe two or three
31:15 - streams ago
31:18 - um
31:19 - so basic you have a lot of options uh
31:21 - with react so we're doing it this way uh
31:24 - today
31:25 - and we may be doing it a different way
31:27 - tomorrow on a different page or
31:28 - different component
31:30 - but let's check it out and see what it
31:31 - looks like now okay
31:33 - better
31:34 - better not exactly what we what we want
31:36 - but much better
31:39 - um so
31:45 - maybe there might be a better way
31:53 - i think there's a better way to do this
31:59 - i'm gonna put this
32:01 - clock up
32:12 - here right
32:15 - um
32:26 - i think how i can make the make sure i i
32:29 - don't want to hard code a value for this
32:31 - button but that and that's obviously the
32:32 - easiest way to do it
32:41 - all right what do we have now for these
32:43 - buttons maybe i do have something hard
32:44 - coded
32:48 - i have nothing
32:57 - all right i have uh devtools
33:02 - oh it looks like
33:05 - can can everyone hear me it might be a
33:07 - problem with the let me know if you
33:10 - can't hear me
33:12 - ah that doesn't make sense what am i
33:14 - thinking all right let me know if you
33:15 - can hear me
33:21 - i wish i could edit the live videos
33:23 - because
33:24 - that
33:25 - the last thing i said made me sound like
33:27 - an idiot
33:31 - i might be one who knows
33:35 - all right
33:37 - here you can't see you
33:40 - oh so my camera's out
33:43 - it's not even there at all
33:48 - man
33:51 - all right i'm gonna switch to my other
33:52 - camera
33:53 - it's not as good of an angle but at
33:55 - least it works
34:01 - man
34:04 - anybody have any suggestions for a good
34:07 - camera that i could get since my ipad
34:10 - camera
34:11 - has been cutting out all the time lately
34:20 - all right let's see
34:27 - okay john
34:32 - john hanson says has some suggestions
34:35 - here flex div with three buttons
34:39 - with just for okay all right let's
34:42 - i know i know john knows about the flex
34:46 - css flex so
34:48 - just for the center for
34:50 - see
34:58 - so maybe i'll try that
35:00 - i'm
35:23 - only one flex container needed for all
35:25 - three buttons okay
35:28 - all right let's try that then
35:53 - all right now i'm getting a lot of
35:54 - suggestions
35:56 - all right let's check this out
35:58 - um also let me see
36:01 - let's see if i can get this
36:03 - camera
36:13 - maybe
36:15 - all right
36:23 - all right let me read through some of
36:24 - these suggestions
36:33 - philip says css is like rocket science
36:35 - to me
36:36 - always break stuff yeah
36:38 - css is
36:40 - it can be like that
36:42 - i think it's fun sometime to mess around
36:44 - with it and see what happens
36:52 - okay uh harsha says there's a um
36:56 - um some documentation
36:59 - about doing this let me check that out
37:03 - uh with trying to do this with material
37:05 - ui
37:43 - so
37:53 - all right so uh actually let me pull
37:55 - this over
37:57 - uh so since we already have the grid
37:58 - layout here
38:00 - i get we probably should have done this
38:01 - already right we should have checked out
38:03 - the documentation
38:05 - for how grid works and what the options
38:07 - are
38:09 - so this is uh material ui
38:12 - their
38:14 - latest version this is a documentation
38:16 - on the grid system
38:21 - harshit says we could check out the
38:24 - interactive grid section
38:32 - okay let's see
38:52 - so
39:03 - let's see how they have this
39:05 - good
39:41 - oh okay um
39:43 - meyer asks uh what's the final goal for
39:45 - positioning the buttons in aurora what
39:47 - okay that yeah it might be helpful if i
39:50 - say that
39:51 - um
39:53 - okay the timer went off
39:55 - so
39:57 - let me
39:58 - just finish this question then we'll do
40:01 - we'll take five minutes do some more
40:03 - questions so the goal is to have the
40:04 - apply button
40:06 - here
40:07 - and the apply button is going to be the
40:10 - same width as the inquiry and visit
40:12 - buttons combined so you basically have
40:15 - apply
40:16 - and then right underneath it it would
40:18 - say inquire and then visit
40:21 - so inquire and visit
40:23 - would be side by side
40:25 - taking up half the space
40:28 - half the width of the apply button the
40:29 - apply on top
40:31 - when you're on a small screen
40:34 - it would change and they would all just
40:36 - stack
40:38 - and be the same
40:39 - all the same size
40:41 - so that's the
40:45 - that's the idea
40:50 - uh okay let's do short break
40:53 - and i'm gonna scroll way up to the top
40:55 - of the live chat there's no way i'm
40:57 - gonna get through everything in five
40:58 - minutes here so some of the questions
41:00 - that came later on i'll have to wait
41:02 - until after the next pomodoro session
41:06 - let's see
41:38 - oh okay
41:39 - um
41:40 - phillip says uh phillip was talking
41:42 - about the pomodoro timer that he made
41:45 - says i want to implement um
41:49 - some kind of stats uh
41:52 - just local using local storage but i
41:54 - break it all the time i said that would
41:56 - be kind of cool
41:57 - uh to do some sort of statistics stuff
41:59 - so let me know do you have this code on
42:02 - github for this uh this timer
42:05 - i'd like to uh check it out if
42:08 - uh if that's all right with you
42:11 - let's see
42:16 - oh it's just cloudflare
42:18 - yeah what did you use to um to make this
42:30 - oh harsha said um
42:33 - he's implementing let's see
42:40 - oh cool i should put a dark theme on his
42:42 - now too
42:43 - awesome
42:48 - i don't know it's just like it seems
42:50 - like easier
42:51 - on your eyes to look at the dark theme
42:54 - as opposed to
42:56 - you know just all this white it's just
42:58 - too bright
43:13 - razvan says do you have any lights there
43:16 - or how do you look that good
43:21 - the only light i have i have a very
43:23 - small light
43:25 - just a little lamp
43:27 - but i have it pointed like facing away
43:29 - so like facing
43:32 - that way
43:33 - like up
43:35 - towards the
43:36 - opposite direction that i am so it just
43:38 - provides like
43:39 - a little bit of light
43:41 - um and then the light from my monitors
43:44 - that's the only light
43:46 - um
43:49 - yeah so it's i mean and then obviously
43:50 - there's some light coming from the
43:52 - hallway so you can see my my door there
43:56 - there's there's some light
44:20 - okay philip says there's also a plan to
44:22 - turn it into a desktop app with electron
44:25 - but i'm not sure if it can access the
44:27 - file system
44:28 - since i would like to also
44:31 - block websites with it
44:36 - i don't know
44:38 - does anyone know that
44:41 - i'm not i mean it's definitely possible
44:43 - to
44:44 - turn this into an electron app
44:47 - um
44:49 - but i haven't worked with electron that
44:50 - much to know very
44:52 - you know very much about it
45:03 - john says uh hopefully material design
45:05 - or any uh styling set out there is not
45:07 - copyright protected yeah as far as i
45:10 - know material design like you can use
45:12 - material design
45:14 - um
45:15 - in in your projects uh i i think google
45:19 - actually prefers that you use it um for
45:21 - android apps especially
45:23 - um so there's no
45:26 - there's no copyright in the sense that
45:27 - you can't actually use material design
45:29 - principles
45:34 - let's see
45:42 - uh neuro asks um what my youtube profile
45:45 - is if you check in the description to
45:48 - this video
45:50 - i do have a link to my youtube channel i
45:52 - think it's
45:54 - the channel id is like jessie r weigel i
45:57 - i think
45:59 - um but anyway it's in the description
46:01 - for for this video so um
46:05 - yeah if you want my i don't update my
46:07 - channel nearly as much as i upload
46:08 - videos here um
46:11 - to uh free code
46:13 - but i have a lot of ideas for videos
46:15 - that i want to do i just
46:17 - i know i've been saying for like
46:20 - being saying for like six months that
46:22 - i'm gonna add videos and i haven't
46:23 - really added that many
46:25 - um but i would like to
46:33 - okay
46:40 - all right so still have a lot left in
46:42 - the live chat i'm going to write down
46:46 - where i'm leaving off at and i will come
46:48 - back
46:49 - to that spot and keep answering
46:51 - questions after our next coding session
46:53 - here
47:03 - okay
47:06 - all right so if i didn't get to your
47:07 - question yet uh please be patient i will
47:10 - get to your question
47:12 - after we do this next um
47:14 - next coding session
47:17 - okay
47:18 - um so let's look at
47:22 - what are we at
47:40 - okay uh jordan and q tube just join and
47:43 - are wondering what's what's going on uh
47:46 - so for right now
47:49 - we're just trying to get these three
47:50 - buttons aligned properly
47:52 - but our other goal our main goal is to
47:55 - try to get some more content on this
47:56 - page just to get an idea of what the
47:58 - layout's going to look like this is the
48:00 - home page
48:01 - of our
48:03 - react site that we're building with next
48:05 - js
48:08 - all right
48:22 - all right let's um
48:25 - let's just
48:26 - auto layout
48:31 - oh
48:32 - this kind of looks like what i want
49:07 - i guess i could
49:08 - make two different containers
49:11 - i don't think i really need to though
49:13 - all right so how did they do this
49:20 - it's just small
49:21 - six
49:41 - i don't know maybe that won't work
49:57 - all right what was i
50:01 - let's get rid of this for a second
50:19 - so
50:26 - okay
50:29 - so here's a great container
50:31 - we could
50:39 - we had a bunch of suggestions for this i
50:41 - want to try to go through suggestions um
50:44 - basically whatever the easiest one to
50:45 - implement is i want to try that first
50:48 - and then move on to some of the the
50:49 - harder ones so i think i remember seeing
50:52 - one that
50:53 - would have been
50:57 - pretty easy
51:18 - oh maybe johnson
51:23 - i don't know if john was saying to make
51:25 - it row or that just stick with the
51:26 - default as being row which
51:29 - yeah it shouldn't change anything
51:31 - the default is row
51:33 - right
51:34 - i thought it was
51:51 - so the creative or flexi right here is
51:54 - to send your content
52:12 - okay
52:13 - so yeah row is the default so i'm going
52:14 - to go ahead and remove that
52:16 - uh just because it's unnecessary
52:20 - we need
52:41 - i'm really wondering if we should have
52:43 - just went with
52:48 - see
52:56 - this honestly would have been easier if
52:57 - i just did all the css myself
53:02 - because now i'm just trying to figure
53:04 - out
53:06 - how to do it within the the grid system
53:09 - that comes with mature ui
53:24 - all right let me see why
53:32 - so i have devtools open
53:37 - on my other screen here
53:44 - i'm trying to figure out why the width
53:46 - is what it is
53:48 - for this button
54:03 - okay so i guess it's just based on the
54:05 - um
54:07 - the label size
54:09 - let's test that out
54:16 - yeah okay so it's it is just based on
54:19 - the the text that we have in there
54:25 - okay that makes sense
54:28 - uh in this case i don't want that to be
54:30 - the case though
54:37 - so let's try
54:40 - let's try just setting
54:42 - up so i
54:44 - i kind of think
54:46 - the surest way that we're going to get
54:48 - this to look right is to kind of set all
54:51 - this
54:54 - in um
54:56 - you know just like absolute units
55:00 - and just make sure that it's
55:03 - narrow enough
55:04 - that it'll work on any device
55:08 - and then we should be
55:09 - should be all right i mean normally like
55:11 - you don't want to hard code with like
55:12 - saying like okay this is going to be 200
55:14 - pixels
55:15 - because if somebody looks at your site
55:16 - on a phone it'll it'll bleed over to the
55:19 - edge right
55:20 - um
55:23 - but if you make it so that the pixels
55:25 - are definitely small i think the
55:27 - smallest phone
55:28 - uh in terms of screen width is like 320
55:32 - pixels so as long as you're below that
55:36 - then you should be all right
55:39 - and we we certainly don't need that much
55:42 - so let's take a look at how many pixels
55:44 - these buttons are taking up right now
55:49 - so
55:51 - i'm not going to bring devtools over
55:53 - 56 okay so this one is 56
55:59 - so
56:00 - if we go with this being which i i like
56:02 - this size so let's go with 56 so we're
56:05 - looking at
56:07 - 112.
56:10 - look at 112 pixels but we do want to
56:12 - space it we want at least 8 pixel space
56:14 - in between these um so that actually
56:17 - that works out fine so this button we're
56:18 - going to make it um 120 pixels wide
56:22 - and then we'll work on
56:25 - on these here to get them to come in and
56:27 - be right underneath here so first things
56:29 - first let's check out our button
56:34 - our button here nice and raised
56:40 - let me show you another way to do css in
56:42 - react
56:45 - so if you wanted to just add something
56:47 - to one element you're not going to reuse
56:48 - that class you might want to think about
56:50 - doing it like this
56:52 - okay so i'm i mean everybody has their
56:55 - own preferences for ways to do it but in
56:57 - this case
57:00 - um i kind of like to do it this way
57:02 - instead of making a whole another class
57:05 - so what we're going to do is say style
57:08 - and
57:09 - we're going to
57:11 - how do we do this was it two i think
57:13 - it's two brackets
57:15 - uh and then we'll say
57:21 - i'm pretty sure it's two racks well
57:22 - we'll find out
57:23 - um
57:26 - they were going to say with
57:30 - yeah it is two brackets right because
57:32 - the first set of brackets is telling is
57:34 - saying hey we're going to do some
57:35 - javascript the second set is an object
57:38 - right and so we want this to be an
57:39 - object
57:41 - so we're going to say with and then
57:43 - we're going to say 120 pixels
57:48 - right on that button and let's see
57:50 - if it works
57:53 - it looks wider let's double check
57:59 - and the width is 120 pixels
58:04 - that really doesn't look like it's going
58:06 - to be wide enough though let me see oh
58:09 - you know what
58:10 - i looked at the wrong size
58:13 - it was 88 pixels the total button size i
58:16 - was just looking
58:19 - at the size of the text alright so we
58:21 - got 88 pixels
58:23 - okay so we'll have to make our button a
58:24 - little bit bigger then um
58:28 - 60 176
58:32 - 176 plus eight
58:36 - um
58:37 - what we got 184
58:41 - i think 184
58:50 - all right so we'll try that so um 88 and
58:53 - 88
58:54 - and then plus 8 pixels for space in
58:56 - between i'm pretty sure you give this
58:58 - 184
59:00 - all right so
59:03 - now let's try to move this in
59:06 - i can just do it in dev tools for now um
59:09 - i suppose
59:11 - so we have a line items center going on
59:14 - here
59:15 - um but we don't want that
59:27 - why do we even have that doesn't make
59:28 - any sense
59:29 - um
59:31 - let's see where this button is going
59:38 - so
59:41 - textile
59:52 - so
60:02 - all right so
60:19 - all right so we can add a justify
60:21 - content
60:28 - um
60:29 - let's see
60:33 - there we go that's better flex and flick
60:36 - store
60:45 - all right so if we add
60:50 - next
61:08 - all right oh let me check out
61:11 - um
61:33 - okay uh john that's what i was messing
61:36 - with in um uh in devtools so
61:42 - and what is harshit is saying p
61:45 - o p r okay
61:48 - p r is up
61:50 - okay um
61:53 - all right we'll see what's what's going
61:55 - on with our shit's pr in a second
61:57 - uh just to
62:00 - show
62:02 - how we could do it
62:06 - uh potentially we could go on this grid
62:08 - item and say
62:11 - oops styles let's just copy this
62:15 - we could add a style into each one of
62:17 - these
62:21 - whoa
62:23 - um
62:26 - and the style could be
62:32 - justify content
62:34 - and then we could do a flex
62:38 - end
62:40 - and then on
62:42 - on this one
62:46 - we could do a flex start
62:55 - and this should align things let's see
62:58 - okay see and then we have things line up
63:02 - you know like we wanted it
63:04 - and
63:05 - now probably this is going to look yeah
63:08 - all right so i think somebody mentioned
63:09 - it's going to look weird on mobile so we
63:12 - would definitely have to add in
63:14 - you know at some point
63:16 - we would need to have a media query
63:20 - uh to fix that
63:23 - or
63:27 - actually potentially we wouldn't right
63:29 - we could just do um
63:34 - we could just change this so that it's
63:36 - it's six all the way
63:39 - let's see if that fixes it
63:49 - yeah that actually fixes it we could go
63:51 - six all the way it looks like this
63:53 - button needs to be a bit wider though
63:56 - um so maybe my mat oh you know what i
63:58 - think my math was right and we just have
64:00 - a larger gap in between here
64:03 - uh than than i was thinking so i
64:06 - actually like
64:08 - that gap i like that size
64:10 - so
64:11 - i'm just going to go ahead and keep that
64:12 - but then adjust the um
64:15 - let's see
64:16 - what do we have here for padding
64:19 - okay so this is 16 pixels so if i just
64:22 - add 8 pixels onto this button it should
64:24 - work um
64:33 - two
64:40 - there we go
64:48 - that doesn't look centered though does
64:50 - it look centered to you
64:56 - something looks off
64:58 - maybe it's just because the dogs
65:01 - i don't know
65:02 - anyway let me check this
65:04 - um
65:09 - okay so harshit has made a pull request
65:12 - too so i guess let's check that out
65:20 - and also there was um
65:23 - i think christian mentioned in a uh in
65:26 - open an issue saying we should update to
65:29 - the latest version of material ui so
65:31 - we'll have to do that i'm not going to
65:33 - do it on the stream today but
65:35 - anyway if christians watching i just
65:37 - want to let you know i i did read that
65:39 - that issue
65:40 - and i will update that soon
65:53 - okay cool uh so check out harshit's uh
65:57 - alternative way of doing it here so
66:01 - this is our same so we've we've he's
66:03 - added this flex row
66:06 - um
66:07 - class
66:08 - that just says display flex
66:10 - and then
66:13 - also added margin you know and margin a
66:16 - pixels
66:17 - so
66:18 - we've added the class name flex row to a
66:21 - div and then just threw the buttons in
66:22 - there
66:24 - and then just added that margin
66:26 - of eight pixels for each one
66:36 - okay cool and actually make sure flex
66:43 - hard i'm i'm wondering though
66:47 - let's see
66:50 - oh okay all right i just saw your
66:52 - message yeah because when i read this
66:53 - i'm wondering that these would align
66:55 - them all center right but it wouldn't
66:58 - it wouldn't be like have the side by
67:00 - side stuff so anyway
67:02 - um
67:06 - uh thanks harshit um i guess we could we
67:09 - kind of stumbled on a solution though
67:11 - here so for now uh this is going to be
67:14 - okay
67:15 - um
67:17 - just to give my boss an idea what it
67:19 - would look like if we had three buttons
67:28 - i don't know why i just i just keep
67:29 - looking at this and it it seems like
67:34 - no it looks better on a smaller screen
67:36 - maybe it does have maybe it is centered
67:41 - all right
67:43 - cool so we've got that part
67:46 - finished um let's let's at least add in
67:50 - some things
67:51 - um
68:00 - john's saying it's an optical uh
68:03 - illusion uh it is centered
68:05 - that's what i was thinking i i i'm kind
68:08 - of thinking on a big screen because the
68:09 - dog's um face
68:13 - is not
68:14 - completely centered and it's more
68:15 - obvious on a large screen that it
68:17 - somehow throws this off for me
68:21 - you know when you get smaller like here
68:24 - it looks fine to me
68:26 - but
68:27 - the dog's face is also centered
68:30 - anyway
68:32 - i'm gonna trust that it's centered
68:35 - uh
68:36 - all right let's check out this card
68:45 - all right we're gonna get rid of this
68:46 - card media
68:49 - let's see yeah
68:50 - yeah i'm gonna get rid of the media
68:58 - and
69:02 - okay good that's that's what it should
69:04 - be doing and let's check out the cards
69:10 - because i want to make a card title so i
69:12 - just want to make see
69:14 - what the title is
69:18 - [Music]
69:29 - okay let's see what they do for title
69:34 - oh they just use typography headline
69:37 - okay
69:38 - that works i actually like it that way
69:41 - um
69:43 - they put it in actions or content okay
69:46 - card content
69:48 - yeah why is this in actions this should
69:50 - be in content
69:58 - and
69:59 - let's say this is
70:02 - events
70:04 - and
70:06 - let's see how it looks first
70:09 - whoa
70:10 - oh card content is not defined
70:13 - we have this
70:20 - we'll probably use card actions at some
70:21 - point so i'm gonna leave it in there
70:25 - uh we in fact we are using it for the
70:27 - other card right now
70:37 - okay
70:38 - cool
70:43 - and what we'll need is
70:49 - let's grab some
70:55 - uh
71:00 - grab some images
71:07 - let's let's go to unsplash
71:12 - i'll just grab a random image
71:18 - okay it's just random i just wanted to
71:20 - double check what the url was
71:23 - um
71:28 - we'll need
71:30 - you know what there's probably a
71:31 - component for this what we want is
71:34 - a list
71:38 - grid list that we want
71:49 - actually
71:53 - this grid list looks a lot like what
71:55 - we're trying to do
72:03 - like these gridless tiles
72:06 - i might have to think about that
72:08 - uh trying to adapt that
72:10 - to use it for a whole layout
72:14 - but that's not what we want right now
72:16 - let's just check out a regular list so i
72:17 - want a list that includes
72:20 - an image
72:25 - there we go
72:26 - this is what i want
72:29 - let's make sure
72:31 - yeah
72:33 - all right so minus the checkbox i want
72:35 - the image
72:37 - and this and then
72:39 - maybe we'll add a description as well
72:53 - okay
73:11 - all right
73:25 - let me throw in
73:30 - within this card
73:33 - there we go in here
73:35 - uh we're gonna put the list in there
73:38 - all right i'm just gonna throw this in
73:39 - here so i don't lose it right now
73:42 - and
73:43 - we're gonna need to bring in
73:46 - we're going to import
73:47 - a list
73:55 - let's import the list item list on the
73:58 - secondary action actions
74:00 - we don't need the secondary action
74:05 - we do need that and we need
74:09 - avatar
74:26 - okay now we can just pull in their
74:28 - example stuff first
74:33 - and then modify it and i think my timer
74:36 - just ran out so
74:38 - as soon as i finish this
74:41 - i'll get to back to the live chat
74:44 - all right so let's take this
74:48 - and
74:50 - let's put it as the
74:53 - source
74:56 - and let's make this
74:59 - square
75:01 - and
75:06 - um
75:08 - what do we want
75:09 - list item text
75:12 - we want
75:14 - for now
75:17 - let's just say
75:20 - event one
75:22 - will completely take out all this
75:24 - checkbox stuff
75:28 - and
75:30 - now
75:35 - all right let's throw it we'll throw it
75:36 - in a couple of times
75:38 - and
75:45 - list item three
75:47 - and we have classes list item so we'll
75:50 - need to get that and add it in as well
75:53 - so where's our list item
75:57 - root
75:58 - oh no
76:01 - are we pulling that in from somewhere
76:03 - else
76:23 - hmm
76:25 - let's see are we bringing in styles
76:28 - all right maybe that'll work
76:30 - value is not defined
76:38 - oops i think i left in some
76:44 - uh
76:45 - some of these values
76:48 - for the key
77:01 - value where's value still used
77:04 - oops
77:11 - uh-oh
77:18 - three
77:19 - four
77:23 - all right let's save that and see what
77:25 - we have now
77:31 - what did i do
77:42 - all right well let's take out oh sh
77:48 - all right let's actually take out
77:50 - typography as well we don't need that
78:03 - i thought i took out austria completely
78:12 - i put them in the wrong spot
78:17 - okay
78:20 - well this makes more sense
78:31 - so
78:48 - all right
79:07 - all right now let's see what happened
79:08 - hey there we go all right
79:13 - okay so this is about what we were
79:14 - looking for
79:16 - um
79:16 - [Music]
79:19 - so we'll have
79:20 - events
79:22 - and i don't know if i'm going to keep it
79:24 - like this circle this obviously works if
79:26 - it was really an avatar it looks fine
79:29 - but
79:30 - potentially we might want you know
79:32 - square images or something for events
79:35 - i don't even know if we want images at
79:36 - all for events really
79:39 - but this would just be something you
79:41 - know to look at
79:43 - as a placeholder
79:49 - all right not bad not as much as i had
79:51 - hoped to get done uh these buttons took
79:53 - way longer than i thought they would
79:56 - uh but
79:59 - at least i had something
80:01 - so we may end up working on this again
80:03 - tomorrow uh we'll see
80:06 - this is our main project now
80:08 - although we do have some other things
80:10 - that need done
80:12 - all right let me go back to live chat
80:15 - and um
80:16 - i'm gonna scroll up
80:19 - let's see 2
80:22 - 17.
80:25 - all right so from here on out i'm not
80:28 - going to do coding i'm going to
80:30 - check out all the questions on the live
80:32 - chat and try to answer as many as i can
80:34 - when i get through everything in the
80:36 - live chat
80:37 - then we will end the stream
80:43 - okay so
80:44 - soft so
80:47 - ss0ph says
80:49 - uh did you learn javascript entirely on
80:51 - free code camp uh no not entirely on
80:54 - free code camp
80:55 - so i um
80:59 - where did i start
81:04 - uh probably it was a mixture of free
81:07 - code camp and udacity
81:11 - a lot of udacity free courses
81:14 - and
81:16 - just
81:17 - i guess i did codecademy too
81:21 - those are like the main resources
81:24 - like for more formal resources online
81:27 - and then a lot of it was just working on
81:29 - projects and looking up how to do things
81:33 - so a lot of trial and error
81:55 - uh john hanson saying random math that
81:58 - will auto play a mix of images for those
82:00 - cards
82:03 - oh maybe that was when i was explaining
82:05 - what this was gonna do um
82:07 - yeah we may do something like that
82:18 - irish it says the dark theme looks
82:20 - awesome i should have made that dark
82:21 - from the beginning
82:22 - yeah the dark it does look cool
82:25 - i started to make obviously for the
82:27 - university we have light you know for
82:29 - all things but for my like side projects
82:32 - i started doing a lot more with with
82:34 - dark themes
82:37 - uh so it is
82:38 - i think it it looks nice
83:01 - let's see
83:06 - nur is asking about what about react uh
83:08 - do you know it very well
83:11 - um
83:13 - i don't
83:14 - i don't know i mean i i know it i've
83:16 - built
83:18 - you know i built things that work with
83:20 - it uh things that are fast um
83:23 - that
83:25 - that look pretty good uh so i know
83:28 - enough to do that i i wouldn't say i'm
83:30 - an expert at react
83:33 - uh but i am proficient
83:35 - i'd say would you would you all say
83:36 - that's a adequate explanation that i'm
83:39 - proficient
83:40 - and react
83:43 - i don't know maybe i'm being too
83:44 - generous with myself there
83:55 - so
84:05 - uh philip asks if i have to specify all
84:08 - the sizes for it to work i'm assuming
84:10 - philip you were talking about these
84:11 - sizes for the grid
84:14 - you know what i don't know i
84:18 - i thought i tried it before and i do
84:20 - have to specify the sizes
84:23 - but i'm not 100 sure
84:27 - i wonder
84:32 - let's just try to take these out and see
84:43 - okay it looks good let's take these out
84:45 - too
84:55 - oh yeah it still works
85:00 - cool
85:02 - let's see can we take
85:03 - [Music]
85:06 - let me take this out
85:09 - oops
85:22 - so far so good
85:35 - yeah actually i am only using the one
85:37 - here so yeah it should be fine right
85:46 - cool yeah so um i'm not sure if that was
85:49 - your question but if it was
85:51 - the answer is no you don't need to
85:53 - define everything
85:55 - i think as long as you define
85:59 - the extra small it'll just by default
86:02 - you know use it for the other sizes
86:04 - that's what it seems like
86:10 - so
86:11 - at least for now it seems like
86:12 - everything's working and and that's how
86:14 - it would work so
86:15 - i guess it does make sense to not use
86:18 - them all you could save a little bit of
86:20 - typing
86:47 - philip says
86:49 - do you prefer
86:50 - css or the react css in the file
86:54 - um philip it kind of depends on what i'm
86:57 - doing
86:58 - so
87:01 - in this file i i really don't mind uh so
87:04 - what we're doing it we're trying to use
87:05 - a lot of the components that come with
87:08 - material ui
87:11 - and this is the way that all the
87:13 - examples for material ui do things so it
87:16 - actually is easier and it makes more
87:17 - sense to just stick with that way of
87:19 - doing things
87:21 - so i like this way obviously
87:24 - i like to combine something like this
87:26 - with some inline styles where
87:29 - appropriate so for instance this width
87:33 - i think it makes sense to make this with
87:36 - inline
87:38 - since we only use it once on one
87:40 - component
87:44 - it ends up
87:45 - using
87:46 - you using up less lines
87:49 - uh we actually don't even add a line at
87:51 - all uh than if we were to create a whole
87:53 - other class just to use it once so i
87:55 - like that
87:56 - uh some people don't like anything
87:58 - inline at all but i don't see a problem
88:00 - with it when used like that
88:03 - but then you know on something like our
88:05 - our faculty.js page
88:08 - where we actually weren't we didn't have
88:10 - a lot of components here
88:13 - but we were importing all this other
88:15 - html
88:17 - and we needed to style that
88:20 - then i really liked using the regular
88:22 - css
88:24 - you know and just bringing it in
88:26 - so how are we importing that
88:36 - i don't remember how we brought that in
88:38 - now
88:42 - oh we brought it we imported it like
88:44 - this
88:45 - uh so
88:47 - i prefer that
88:48 - uh because really
88:50 - i have to go to the page check it out in
88:53 - dev tools do the changes i can come back
88:55 - and do it in the css file i don't have
88:57 - access directly to that
88:59 - that markup from within my component
89:02 - so doing it like this makes a lot more
89:05 - sense
89:08 - is this how i have to do it no i don't
89:11 - have to do it like that but
89:14 - um for me it just it
89:17 - it makes more sense to do it like this
89:20 - than to have it in here you know like i
89:23 - don't want to have
89:24 - a bunch of you know css classes here
89:28 - for things that you can't even really
89:29 - see in the component you know we're just
89:31 - bringing this in
89:33 - um
89:34 - it
89:35 - to me i think it makes this component
89:37 - more reusable
89:39 - it's obvious right that we are bringing
89:41 - in some styles here
89:43 - but really at any point we could change
89:46 - this and make it a prop
89:48 - and then we could potentially reuse this
89:50 - now i know this is a page and it's in a
89:52 - page in in next
89:54 - but
89:56 - if we really wanted to
90:00 - you know in let's say in a somewhat
90:01 - different situation
90:03 - this entire thing could be reusable we
90:06 - just pop in a different
90:08 - um
90:09 - css file
90:11 - so it would make sense to me you know
90:14 - so anyway it just kind of depends
90:22 - all right
90:35 - uh what's this uh naren says the mobile
90:38 - version of the website downgrades the
90:40 - user experience a lot the hover property
90:42 - and the background attachment fixed are
90:44 - no longer displayed any substitutions
90:47 - for that
90:49 - um
90:51 - are you
90:52 - talking about this site
90:59 - i'm not that was um noreen asked that
91:09 - so and maybe like just in general um
91:12 - so on the mobile i think background
91:15 - attachment fix actually does work on
91:17 - android
91:20 - um
91:22 - at least last time i tried i was pretty
91:24 - sure it worked but you're right so on
91:26 - ios
91:28 - mobile safari it does not work
91:30 - um
91:32 - as well as the hover so uh which you
91:34 - still can get is like a tap effect
91:36 - so
91:37 - right now like the hover here let's see
91:39 - if i have it okay so you see that effect
91:41 - that just happens when i
91:43 - click it
91:44 - you can still have that happen on touch
91:47 - so you'll get
91:48 - obviously you're not going to have a
91:49 - hover on on a touch screen right
91:52 - but you can still get some effect on the
91:54 - button that ripple
91:57 - and then with the background thing
91:59 - you could do
92:01 - two things one you could just make it so
92:04 - that your background attachment is not
92:06 - fixed you switch it over with a media
92:08 - query to something like maybe static
92:11 - and then you just don't get that
92:12 - parallax effect anymore
92:15 - at works it's it's okay
92:17 - or if you wanted to
92:20 - keep the parallax effect you could
92:22 - switch over and use some javascript to
92:24 - give you that same parallax effect
92:27 - okay a little bit heavier
92:30 - but you get the same user experience
92:33 - on a mobile device and a desktop
92:36 - so i guess it just depends on
92:39 - on you know what you want to do for a
92:40 - site let's say that maybe
92:43 - is not going to get a lot of mobile use
92:45 - maybe you don't want to worry about it
92:47 - but for a site that's going to be you
92:49 - have a lot of mobile users you may want
92:51 - to think about one with the javascript
92:54 - you know parallax scrolling effect
93:29 - uh philip asks if the timer gave a
93:31 - notification sound i don't remember
93:34 - hearing a notification sound
93:37 - um
93:39 - so i don't know i wasn't really paying
93:41 - attention though i saw a notification
93:43 - pop up
93:44 - on my screen
93:46 - but i didn't hear the sound
93:49 - but it i mean i'm listening to music too
93:51 - so depending on what the sound was
93:53 - it could have happened and i just wasn't
93:55 - paying attention didn't hear it over the
93:57 - music
94:05 - okay rook says i'm gonna mess around
94:06 - with the fork of this project uh awesome
94:09 - rook um you're you're welcome to make a
94:11 - pull request if you want or if you take
94:12 - it in another direction and do some cool
94:14 - stuff with it um let me know i'd love to
94:17 - check it out
94:23 - youtube says that dog is adorable yeah
94:26 - it is i love this stuff
94:29 - my um
94:30 - my wife's parents have a dog that looks
94:33 - just like this
94:34 - it's actually it looks like it's it's um
94:37 - fatter than this one but
94:41 - uh
94:42 - but anyway they have a dog like this
94:44 - and uh her name is lilo
94:47 - but it always reminds me of her
94:50 - you know i like the dog
94:53 - it is so cute it's distractingly cute
95:00 - says i wish i was that doggo
95:03 - noreen says
95:05 - the dog is smelling the button yeah it
95:06 - does look like that
95:09 - phillip says can we get a dog instead of
95:10 - jesse nothing personal just
95:14 - i might actually get more viewers if i
95:16 - just had a dog sitting here and you
95:18 - could see the dog i could still do the
95:20 - voice over and do the coding but if you
95:23 - just saw a video of a dog
95:25 - instead of my face
95:27 - that might be a better viewing
95:29 - experience
95:30 - i don't know if i could bring a dog into
95:32 - work though
95:34 - i have to see if i if i ever get better
95:36 - internet at my house maybe i'll borrow
95:38 - someone's dog and we'll try it out
95:41 - [Music]
95:55 - uh purville says i've just joined what's
95:57 - this project about
95:59 - um
95:59 - today we were just working with aligning
96:02 - some buttons
96:03 - and creating this card
96:05 - that displays events
96:07 - but the project in general is going to
96:09 - be the main website for the university
96:11 - that i work for that's franciscan
96:13 - university of steubenville we're
96:15 - building it with react specifically
96:17 - we're using next.js
96:20 - mainly for the server-side rendering
96:22 - that it offers
96:24 - and
96:28 - we're migrating a lot of data from
96:31 - another database into a wordpress
96:36 - mysql database and then we're going to
96:38 - pull that data with graphql into our
96:40 - react application
96:42 - if you want to know more about the
96:43 - project
96:44 - go back and watch some of the previous
96:46 - videos especially the first few videos
96:49 - for project five
96:51 - and you'll get a much more thorough
96:53 - explanation of what we're trying to do
96:55 - here
97:10 - uh q tube asks what does typography do
97:14 - so
97:15 - type let's see i have it somewhere here
97:18 - oops let's go over to index so q tube is
97:20 - asking about the typography
97:23 - uh element here so when you're using
97:26 - material ui
97:28 - the the beta version they have this
97:30 - element called typography and you can
97:33 - give it a type
97:34 - and depending on the type anything in
97:36 - here will display differently so a
97:38 - subheading
97:40 - will display a certain way you could do
97:41 - different kinds of headings right like
97:43 - h1 h2 you could do regular body text
97:46 - like paragraph text so
97:48 - you know you can check out the uh
97:52 - the documentation for material ui beta
97:55 - on typography and see all the options
97:57 - that are available
97:58 - but basically
98:00 - anywhere where you want text to display
98:03 - you could just do typography
98:06 - and then add a type and that's how you
98:08 - would display your text so you're you're
98:10 - almost never going to see just a
98:12 - paragraph tag
98:14 - or an h tag you know just hanging out
98:17 - here when you're using uh material ui
98:21 - beta version you certainly could put it
98:23 - in there
98:25 - but
98:26 - material ui you know has you covered
98:28 - with this typography component
98:31 - i'm sorry not a component but
98:34 - i guess it is it is a component um
98:37 - we just never work directly with
98:39 - with it as a component here but
98:43 - uh but it is i
98:44 - i don't know why i was calling it
98:47 - something else but you import it from
98:51 - yeah from material ui
98:58 - rook says is that a dinner bell i hear
99:00 - it sorry i'm hungry what was it oh yeah
99:03 - it was so it it's not a dinner bell but
99:06 - pretty close like right across the
99:08 - hallway from my office there's a bell on
99:10 - the wall and there's like a little room
99:12 - uh
99:13 - like a little prayer room
99:15 - and uh at three o'clock
99:17 - pretty much every day at three o'clock
99:18 - they ring the bell and then people go in
99:21 - there and and they pray
99:22 - um
99:24 - you know for everybody in the office and
99:25 - whatever else they want to pray for
99:29 - um
99:30 - so
99:31 - but i usually do my streams during that
99:33 - time
99:34 - so if you do hear a bell
99:36 - around it's 3 p.m my time eastern time
99:39 - that's what it is
99:54 - okay philip says
99:56 - by the way one thing to always remember
99:57 - if you're working with a wordpress site
99:59 - if you move it from live to local
100:01 - environment remember to change database
100:04 - settings
100:05 - or you might nuke half of your live site
100:08 - yeah
100:09 - i've moved a lot of wordpress sites
100:12 - over the years so um it's always good to
100:14 - have the reminder though
100:16 - um
100:17 - but yeah you got to be careful when
100:19 - you're moving it doesn't always work out
100:21 - how you think it would work out moving
100:23 - wordpress sites is is always it seems
100:26 - more complicated than
100:28 - than you would would want it to be than
100:30 - it should be but
100:32 - um
100:33 - and i don't do it often enough to
100:35 - remember exactly how i did it every time
100:37 - so i always have to look up the
100:39 - instructions for how to properly move it
100:43 - but
100:45 - we'll probably move it on a stream or
100:47 - something so
100:49 - that might be a cool stream to do
100:57 - uh jordan asks if this is on github
101:01 - it is it is on github
101:04 - uh the repo i think is called
101:07 - let's see do i have the repo up
101:10 - i thought i did yeah the repos called
101:13 - franciscan react
101:20 - and actually
101:22 - i should um i'll push the changes up now
101:34 - did i never push changes from this
101:37 - faculty.css
101:40 - i guess not
101:45 - wow
101:47 - sorry to anyone who uh
101:49 - was trying to look at this i guess i
101:51 - forgot to put changes push changes from
101:54 - weeks ago
101:56 - um
102:00 - uh
102:14 - all right so i'm going to commit that
102:15 - and then i'll push it
102:17 - list is defined but never used
102:23 - import list
102:35 - wait did i mess this up
102:38 - ah i did
102:39 - all right
102:42 - let's wrap this in a list
102:51 - i mean it still worked
102:54 - but we'll try to do this the proper way
103:04 - make sure it still looks alright
103:10 - where's the page at
103:16 - okay cool
103:18 - uh still works
103:31 - now it's going to run a bunch of checks
103:33 - it's going to do the tests
103:35 - it's going to do some formatting
103:38 - some auto formatting in the code if it
103:40 - passes everything
103:43 - obviously linting as well but if it
103:45 - passes everything then
103:48 - we'll have a successful commit awesome
103:51 - and it says i should update npm
103:54 - uh now we can go get push
103:58 - origin
103:59 - since we're on the master branch
104:01 - no
104:02 - i did turn my computer off when i wasn't
104:05 - here over
104:06 - over the break
104:08 - i need to put this in again
104:27 - so
104:37 - all right
104:43 - okay
104:44 - so now uh our gate repo should be
104:47 - updated
104:54 - if i could find it
105:00 - so many windows open
105:10 - there it is
105:14 - all right
105:14 - cool um
105:16 - so we did have
105:19 - so we do have everything updated at this
105:22 - point
105:39 - okay uh i iboto
105:42 - i think that's how you pronounce it says
105:44 - is asking about the theme in visual
105:46 - studio code hardship said it is the seti
105:48 - theme
105:49 - uh
105:50 - i better wanted to know what exactly the
105:53 - name was um
105:58 - preferences
106:01 - you
106:03 - where do i go
106:05 - i don't even know where i go to change
106:07 - the
106:12 - maybe setting oh you know what i just
106:14 - found it no
106:15 - color theme
106:19 - yeah actually it's just seti scti that's
106:21 - the name of the
106:23 - the theme
106:46 - as jordan said the repo has not been
106:48 - updated in two weeks
106:50 - yeah
106:52 - that was my fault we had done work on
106:54 - the stream and i just forgot to push the
106:56 - changes uh up to the the repo
106:59 - do we have any other
107:02 - we did have some other branches too
107:08 - but right now the one actively being
107:10 - worked on is the master branch
107:16 - sergio says ask do you recommend udacity
107:20 - front-end certification i've done a lot
107:22 - of the udacity courses for that
107:25 - front-end certification the free
107:27 - versions of them
107:29 - so
107:29 - some courses on udacity you have to pay
107:32 - to get any access to at all other ones
107:35 - you can go through the course for free
107:37 - you just won't get your projects
107:40 - uh reviewed by
107:42 - anybody at udacity
107:44 - so the review is valuable
107:47 - so if you have the money and the time
107:49 - i think it it is really valuable to do
107:52 - the product the paid version of the
107:54 - projects
107:55 - i don't know
107:57 - if the certification helps that much you
107:59 - know to
108:00 - let's say put that on a resume
108:02 - i don't really know uh maybe for
108:04 - companies that have hired people from
108:06 - udacity
108:08 - and are
108:10 - you know happy with those those people
108:12 - the work that they do maybe it'll mean
108:13 - something to them
108:15 - but i don't know that udacity is well
108:16 - known enough that it'll like guarantee
108:18 - you a job
108:20 - but the
108:23 - when you turn in a project for udacity
108:25 - you're doing the paid version
108:27 - and you get the feedback from someone
108:30 - that's really really valuable it'll push
108:33 - you to make better projects so like i
108:34 - said if you have the time and the money
108:37 - i do recommend it
108:38 - but don't feel like you have to
108:41 - you can certainly still get you know a
108:43 - lot of the knowledge from the free
108:45 - version of the course
108:46 - and then if you ever get a time where
108:48 - you do have some more time or more money
108:51 - then you can do the paid version and you
108:53 - already are ahead of the game because
108:55 - you've you've gone through a lot of it
108:58 - but yeah i would for sure check out the
109:00 - free version of the courses
109:02 - think about doing the paid version i'm
109:05 - not affiliated with udacity in any way
109:07 - so
109:08 - that's just my honest opinion
109:11 - so i have done the free and the paid
109:13 - version of
109:14 - some of the courses
109:17 - and i think there's good content
109:20 - on udacity
109:36 - uh z work says why does free code camp
109:39 - seem to focus on front end development
109:41 - why we why don't they cover the back end
109:44 - uh they actually do have back-end
109:46 - lessons it just comes later on so if you
109:48 - look at you know the free code camp
109:50 - website
109:51 - um
109:54 - we'll check it out right now
109:56 - uh
109:57 - let's see
110:01 - no i want the map here we go so you can
110:04 - see i only have 285 points
110:07 - uh but you know all this stuff at the
110:09 - beginning is front end uh but you get
110:11 - here there's a data
110:13 - visualization certification then we have
110:15 - the back end
110:16 - so there's a whole section that's for
110:18 - the back end
110:19 - it's just you know a lot of people if
110:21 - they're trying to go in order a lot of
110:23 - people don't get to that point it takes
110:24 - a lot of work to get there
110:27 - you know for me
110:28 - i started going through free code camp
110:30 - and then i just i got too much paid work
110:33 - and i started doing that and just kind
110:36 - of didn't get around to
110:38 - you know to finishing it
110:41 - i'd love to finish it one day
110:43 - uh just
110:46 - not not right now i'll probably wait
110:48 - until the new curriculum comes out to do
110:49 - anything more with it uh but we we do in
110:53 - fact have uh back end
110:56 - a back-end certification
110:58 - and
111:00 - we have a lot of back-end uh projects
111:12 - uh catholic says does anyone know a good
111:14 - auto format package for visual studio
111:17 - code for react
111:19 - rook says uh prettier plus eslint
111:22 - um
111:23 - catholic says thanks had to stop using
111:25 - it because
111:27 - of the formatting hopefully that fixes
111:29 - it
111:29 - um
111:34 - okay yeah that i i use the prettier
111:36 - eslint setup as well
111:45 - uh
111:46 - teo says
111:48 - uh are you doing this with bootstrap no
111:51 - not bootstrap uh we're using
111:53 - material ui
111:55 - uh the beta version of material ui
111:59 - so it's a react
112:01 - um it basically it does what bootstrap
112:04 - does for for regular html sites it does
112:06 - that for react and it uses the material
112:09 - design
112:10 - style
112:17 - oh mayor says i did a pull request
112:19 - please check
112:22 - cool let's just check this out
112:30 - button layouts
112:55 - all right cool thanks mayor i'll have to
112:57 - check this out
113:04 - let's see
113:12 - says jesse we need to code
113:14 - [Music]
113:15 - we did uh if you're joining us later on
113:17 - uh we finished the coding portion so
113:20 - normally if you join me in a live chat
113:22 - for like the first hour or so that's
113:24 - when we do the majority of the coding
113:27 - and then the last part of the live
113:28 - stream is when i answer the questions so
113:31 - you can check out the code portion of it
113:32 - on the recording in this video and if
113:35 - you don't want us hang around for the
113:36 - questions and all the talking just skip
113:38 - that part of the video um so actually
113:41 - that's good i i know um i've i've had
113:43 - people before say they like the code
113:45 - part not so much the talking part so
113:48 - maybe in that case the live stream isn't
113:50 - really the best thing for you if you
113:52 - wait and watch the recording
113:54 - you could watch it
113:56 - um you could either skip the talking all
113:58 - together or just play it on a fast speed
114:00 - and then slow it down when the code part
114:03 - comes
114:04 - so that i think that's a great way to do
114:06 - it if you don't have a lot of time or if
114:09 - you're just
114:10 - you know really want to
114:12 - you know see the coding uh you know skip
114:15 - to like some part that's interesting for
114:17 - you so um
114:19 - so anyway for anybody that is in that
114:21 - situation you know give that a try
114:24 - i love to have you all for the live chat
114:26 - but i totally understand if it's uh if
114:28 - it's too time consuming
114:31 - or if i'm just too boring to listen to i
114:33 - i get that too
114:44 - all right
114:46 - rook says that that pr from mayor is
114:49 - great
114:50 - cool i'll have to i'll have to check out
114:52 - how this looks
114:54 - after the stream
114:57 - two is too much says what is your
114:59 - project uh it's a react project it's
115:01 - gonna be the main website for franciscan
115:04 - university of steubenville
115:06 - so
115:07 - just really quickly we're using react
115:09 - we're going to do server-side rendering
115:11 - we're pulling the data from
115:13 - a wordpress
115:14 - um
115:17 - uh wordpress installation that's using
115:20 - graphql so we're gonna get the data out
115:22 - of that and display it with react
115:27 - all right and that's it i'm to the end
115:29 - of the live chat so uh thank you all for
115:32 - for watching
115:33 - and if you ask a question and i i
115:36 - skipped over it that was definitely
115:38 - accidental
115:39 - so um you go and send me a question on
115:42 - twitter if you want or uh put it as a

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and happy new year it's 2018. so uh it's been a while what like a week week and a half since our stream so um we're going to jump back into that main project that we were working on so i have it up on the screen now um the this is what will end up being franciscan.edu uh so today i want to try to um just make a layout for the homepage right now you know we don't have much right we have our hero section but you know we kind of just threw these in i think they were just left over from some code that we copied in from a previous project uh so i'd like to do first i'd like to explain like what i'm thinking get your feedback on it and then we'll try to build it out we're um we're not going to use like any real data uh we'll just kind of like you know hard code some lorem ipsum in there or something i just would like to give my boss you know some something to look at like a real site they could scroll through and look at and uh and see what he thinks i've discussed some some design options with him uh before christmas and i made some sketches uh just in a notebook so that's what i'm gonna go from they're just they're really rough i haven't thought everything out completely uh so we'll we'll just test it out and see what works uh so i'm gonna check the live chat before we get started just to say say hi to everyone um hey everybody we do have a question which music app uh you guys use i just switched to google play music because spotify is not available in my country and i was able to pay for the premium membership using an indian credit card that's cool yeah um i use spotify i'm using spotify right now um i like spotify i definitely i enjoy the spotify premium so there's no commercials i've tried out google play music before as well um it was maybe two years ago did i tried it i think to you maybe it was only a year i can't remember um it was at least a year ago maybe more so i don't know what it's like now if it's changed a lot but i'm definitely happy with uh with spotify but if you don't have spotify i think you know google play music is good i always i used to listen to pandora all the time too uh you don't i don't know if they've changed pandora but i mean it's not the same as spotify where you can select the song you want it was always kind of random songs so a little bit different there but it's still nice okay oh phillip listen says uh he listens to music on youtube actually i used to do that too sometimes people put on some nice um like mixes on youtube sometimes i'd hear songs on youtube that i couldn't find on spotify or really anywhere else and i still have to go back to youtube uh to listen to it oh man harshit said pandora's also blocked there well i guess google music might be your best bet then all right uh one more question and then we'll get started let's see how would use this is from bernardo how would you describe the learning curve of react when compared to angular or view okay so i'm going to answer this question but i want everyone to know i tried to learn react alone like years ago so or i'm sorry i tried to learn angular years ago i was not nearly as good with javascript so this i don't have an equal comparison here but i found react a lot easier to learn than angular but just take that for what it what it is i tried to learn angular 1 when i was just kind of new with javascript i tried to learn react after i had been working with javascript for for years so that may account for it uh for the difference in you know my ability to learn it um i have not tried out any of the newer versions of angular though so i don't know that my answer is really that helpful all right oh so uh i saw phillips comment in the chat reminding me so philip made a pomodoro clock a pomodoro timer here so we've been using uh harshit's timer which is awesome and now uh phillip sent me the link to this on twitter and uh we'll just check this out you know quickly before we start because it's cool uh so basically i mean a pomodoro timer is is pretty basic you know it needs to start a 25 minute timer you know you put in your breaks your your short and long breaks and you need to be able to start to stop the timer right super easy um i don't mean it's easy to build i just mean like the concept is easy right but this is a cool feature i haven't seen on a pomodoro timer before and hardship if you have this on yours forgive me i just haven't haven't seen it uh but there's a dark theme on the pomodoro timer and if you've watched this before you all know how much i like uh the dark themes for pretty much everything i mean even my office is dark all the time and uh actually the paint is you can't tell because the lights are off and the camera's not facing a wall but all the paint in my office is darker than anybody else's office in this building uh such i came in when it was still under construction and they had already painted it i was disappointed because i wanted darker colors and then i noticed that somebody had accidentally spill splattered paint all over the walls so then i got talked to the guy in charge of the construction and i said hey well you got to repaint this anyway right and so i end up getting all the dark the dark paint but anyway i'm sure y'all didn't didn't need to hear that story but uh my point was i just think the dark theme is cool so thanks for sharing that with me phillip uh that was really cool maybe we'll use this one today and uh we'll switch out if anybody else has any cool pomodoro timers that you made maybe we'll feature new ones um as as you all come up with new ones then just send them to me and uh as long as they work we use them wow i got a lot of activity in the live chat okay i want to um i'm just gonna uh just very briefly check out the live chat see if there's anything i should address now before we start okay pretty much a lot of talking about music players someone uh someone asks do i need to master javascript to apply for junior web developer job no you don't need to master anything to apply for a junior web developer i think um sorry i'm drinking a lot i have a sore throat i've been coughing so i don't want to like cough a lot during the stream so i i got some coffee here no i don't think you need to master javascript you just you need enough to be able to do what they need you to do for the job oh someone asked what i was drinking yeah it's uh coffee right now okay here's a question that i probably should answer before we start what is material design so i think i put it in the title of this video material design is um the the design principles i guess that google developed uh for for all of its products so if you look at a lot of google's products you um you can see similarities right so let's take a look just within this i mean you can see uh you have a certain shadow here to this card so their items that are in look like they're raised off of kind of the background and these are called cards in material design they have a certain shadow that makes them appear to be a certain height off of the um the background or with you know within material design you could call it the paper uh it has you know the same border radius on on everything uh the buttons behave the same so like there's it's this unified framework i don't want to go too much into the philosophy of it because i think we've covered it on previous streams but if you check out google's page on material design uh you'll they have a lot i mean there's pages and pages and pages of examples and you know them explaining why they do it this way but that's what i mean by material design it's it's google's design you know framework so that's what we're using and michael says accidentally splash paint was it you it was not me i did not splash the paint but that would have been a good idea but it was somebody else all right so let me get started now since we i've done quite a bit of talking here at the beginning so where's that timer let's use this timer uh so i'm going to start this pomodoro session i'm going to code for 25 minutes then i'm going to take a five minute break i'm going to come back to the live chat answering your questions so if you put a question in there and i haven't got to it yet uh please just be patient i will get to it if i can't get to everything in that five minute break i'll get to it at the end uh but after that five minute break we'll do another 25 minute session we'll try to get two pomodoro sessions in today uh and then after that we'll do all question and answer if you can't stick around to the end of this stream you'll be able to watch uh i'll answer all your questions at the end even if you're not here and you can just watch the recording later on the video will be available on the free code camp youtube channel okay so let me just just a minute or two explanation of of kind of what my boss and i were talking about so his idea was to have the front page be let's say like dynamic so what what he means by that is he wants it so that when you come to the page uh there's going to be different content there and so it won't be let me restart this let me start first of all the main target audience for this site for this page are going to be students like prospective students so mostly people in high school that might want to come to this university right all right so having said that the look and feel of this is almost gonna seem like somewhat i don't know i don't want to say like a social media thing it's because it's not but it it's almost gonna have like a pinterest style of lots of different things uh being there uh but it's gonna be it's gonna look more random than it really is so you'll see this as we get started uh but the idea is that people might have incentive to come back to to this site to see what's new but we do want to make it obvious that hey you can apply so like this button here we'll say apply now right so we want to make it the the message of the site the marketing message is obvious we want you to apply but there's also going to be a lot of other stuff that you can check out on this home page of course if you know what you want you can always go to the menu and go right to it all right so that's kind of the idea so here's how it's going to work i don't even know if this is worth it i don't think you'll be able to see the sketch no it's like even if you could see the sketch it's not very impressive so i'll just do my best to explain so what we would have is a bunch of cars kind of like what we have here we have some cars but we would have cards of different shapes and sizes all in here kind of in like um not like a grid as in everything being the same but you know you've seen those kind of like mosaic type grids where you have some cards will be wider or taller than the other cards everything just fits in that's what we're gonna have so we may have a large uh card here let's say that's a section for events and we'd pull the data from wherever we're getting our events which may be in wordpress maybe we're pulling it from i don't know like eventbrite or something and it would list a bunch of the events have some little thumbnails right um and then maybe in in this section we'd have two smaller cards right and one of the cards would be like a fact about franciscan like i don't know like 95 percent of franciscan graduates or like find a job within the first year i don't know if that's true but we would have some impressive sounding fact about franciscan there and we these could rotate you know we could have a custom post type and wordpress about franciscan facts right and it could we could just get a random one every time something like that right uh and then another section you know another card could be a video right video tour of one of the dorm rooms or something you know or or of campus or you know whatever um and then we just go down with these different cards so some things would change like obviously when you come back there would be different events here as time goes on but it would be basically static that you know you're always going to be able to find the events here there'd always be a fact right there but it may be a different one than you saw before same way there might be a video might be a different one you know potentially we could have it so that i i hate to do this because it reminds me of having a slider but possibly you could have it so people could click through and see all the different facts you know that's a possibility as well or you could have it so that there's a fact card here and then scroll down the page a little bit more and there's another one over here um potentially we could just throw in nice pictures of campus it could be switched in and out you know seasonally so that in wintertime you're seeing pictures of campus with snow on the ground all right so there's a lot of cool stuff we could do if there's a live stream going on at the university like not my live stream but sometimes they live stream events you know it could show up there could be a spot where if there is a live stream it's going to show up there right so that's kind of the idea i have no idea if it'll look right or if it'll work or make sense that's what we're going to try today i just glanced at the chat and saw philip said wordpress hearing that word is killing me yeah we're using a headless wordpress so it's not it's not like the normal wordpress that that everyone's used to using uh but we we tried to find an alternative and it's not going to happen for this project uh maybe down the road we'll have something all right so first thing we need to do is find the index file so now let's get into some code i will be using visual studio code all right this is a different project let's switch this out there we go okay uh we should find the index page so we used next js i'll um increase the font size here in just a second so we're using next to um to build this react site so next comes in with the comes with a builtin router and so any anything you put in the pages folder becomes a page in the site the home page is index.js so that's where we're going to go now i'm going to go to the home page and um right eventually these will be added in dynamically but for right now we um we're just going to kind of hard code a lot of it okay um we could probably leave some of these cards up and just modify them a bit okay let's go in here see what's what's going on um let's change this i know my boss wanted um more more buttons here so let's add some more buttons let's add an apply button and we want i think he also wanted a reply inquire and visit so i i kind of think we ought to just have one button i generally like having one instead of multiple ones so we're talking about this button right here it's called action um but he he wanted to have more than one so make this give this a more realistic aspect ratio um so we're gonna i'm gonna try it i'm gonna show it to him with three see how it looks let's see what happens yeah i definitely don't want it like that if we're gonna do it it's gonna be like this let's see we're gonna we're gonna need this grid in here uh so let's use we're gonna add a grid container component good and then within that let's bring in a great item and i'm gonna want three of these well let's see we want it to be on extra small uh 12 will work but then anything other than that yeah six six the first one we wanted to actually be 12 all the way up um and then after that we it to be sorry let me explain this a little bit more the grid system is based on 12 column layout so if we want it to be full width we put 12 so on extra small screens it's going to be full width 12 columns on small screens and up it's going to be half width six columns so i'm going to make a grid here and for this one this top portion of the grid it's going to be like this otherwise we're going to stick with these so i'm going to add in our buttons here and we actually need automatically changed it for me um let's see what's up with these lines is it just indentation yeah it is okay um so the main button that i want users to see is going to be the largest button and then let's put that visit button in here as well and let's get rid of these slashes okay if any of this is kind of confusing to you let me know in the live chat and then when we have our break i'll see it and i can go back over and uh try to explain some of it i messed up my indentation somewhere okay let's just say that see whoa what did i do all right this is all just indentations though all right let's see grid container all right let's get back over and see uh this should not be that's pretty weird um let's see what's going on we are using the latest version of material ui for our layout so i still don't have a familiarity with with that version of material ui uh to know just offhand what to do so i'll have to look up some things which is not not the end of the world i'm just trying to see okay all right i see what's happening now all right that makes sense okay so here's what's happening uh the grid container component is taking up the full width here uh this button is um taking up full width uh so you can see it's going to show it all right yeah so this container for that button you can see is full width uh so let's um let's just try change this up a bit let's see what we have here um layouts see what we have display flex selenium uh all right let's see what we should we can change okay let me get some suggestions here in the live chat let's check that out uh meyer or mayor is saying make it inline rook saying justify content center on the flex container okay we have justify content center on on this container here which is that's that parallax section right where is this in okay rook saying on the parent of the button to uh center okay uh let's do that then we're gonna say classes container all right so let's add on these grid items let's do a class name and oops classes dots hero button and then up here let's make uh hero button class whoops and we'll do justify content center center okay so if this looks weird to you uh it looks kind of like css but it's not really css uh that's because oops what did i do i messed something up down here for some reason i added a square bracket there we go work says add display flex as well oh display flex all right so within uh react there are many different ways to do uh css uh i messed it up again that's why so i i meant to put in equals and instead i put in a square bracket and then i took out the square bracket but didn't put the equal sign back in okay so anyway this is one of the ways that you can do css so you make a javascript object and you you give it it it looks kind of like css right so we have our classes so we have a class called parallax and then within that class we have all our properties here and our values right so it looks somewhat familiar but the syntax is just a bit different it's the same syntax you'd use in a normal javascript object right so we have to camel case um all of our our properties then inside here we could do things like we normally would right because these are all strings so that's how we're doing and then when we go to apply this we're going to say class name classes.parallax okay that's one way you could do it you can see you know in in the previous streams we've tried out you know several different ways of doing things in fact even within this project we're doing things like kind of a normal css way here we worked on this um maybe two or three streams ago um so basic you have a lot of options uh with react so we're doing it this way uh today and we may be doing it a different way tomorrow on a different page or different component but let's check it out and see what it looks like now okay better better not exactly what we what we want but much better um so maybe there might be a better way i think there's a better way to do this i'm gonna put this clock up here right um i think how i can make the make sure i i don't want to hard code a value for this button but that and that's obviously the easiest way to do it all right what do we have now for these buttons maybe i do have something hard coded i have nothing all right i have uh devtools oh it looks like can can everyone hear me it might be a problem with the let me know if you can't hear me ah that doesn't make sense what am i thinking all right let me know if you can hear me i wish i could edit the live videos because that the last thing i said made me sound like an idiot i might be one who knows all right here you can't see you oh so my camera's out it's not even there at all man all right i'm gonna switch to my other camera it's not as good of an angle but at least it works man anybody have any suggestions for a good camera that i could get since my ipad camera has been cutting out all the time lately all right let's see okay john john hanson says has some suggestions here flex div with three buttons with just for okay all right let's i know i know john knows about the flex css flex so just for the center for see so maybe i'll try that i'm only one flex container needed for all three buttons okay all right let's try that then all right now i'm getting a lot of suggestions all right let's check this out um also let me see let's see if i can get this camera maybe all right all right let me read through some of these suggestions philip says css is like rocket science to me always break stuff yeah css is it can be like that i think it's fun sometime to mess around with it and see what happens okay uh harsha says there's a um um some documentation about doing this let me check that out uh with trying to do this with material ui so all right so uh actually let me pull this over uh so since we already have the grid layout here i get we probably should have done this already right we should have checked out the documentation for how grid works and what the options are so this is uh material ui their latest version this is a documentation on the grid system harshit says we could check out the interactive grid section okay let's see so let's see how they have this good oh okay um meyer asks uh what's the final goal for positioning the buttons in aurora what okay that yeah it might be helpful if i say that um okay the timer went off so let me just finish this question then we'll do we'll take five minutes do some more questions so the goal is to have the apply button here and the apply button is going to be the same width as the inquiry and visit buttons combined so you basically have apply and then right underneath it it would say inquire and then visit so inquire and visit would be side by side taking up half the space half the width of the apply button the apply on top when you're on a small screen it would change and they would all just stack and be the same all the same size so that's the that's the idea uh okay let's do short break and i'm gonna scroll way up to the top of the live chat there's no way i'm gonna get through everything in five minutes here so some of the questions that came later on i'll have to wait until after the next pomodoro session let's see oh okay um phillip says uh phillip was talking about the pomodoro timer that he made says i want to implement um some kind of stats uh just local using local storage but i break it all the time i said that would be kind of cool uh to do some sort of statistics stuff so let me know do you have this code on github for this uh this timer i'd like to uh check it out if uh if that's all right with you let's see oh it's just cloudflare yeah what did you use to um to make this oh harsha said um he's implementing let's see oh cool i should put a dark theme on his now too awesome i don't know it's just like it seems like easier on your eyes to look at the dark theme as opposed to you know just all this white it's just too bright razvan says do you have any lights there or how do you look that good the only light i have i have a very small light just a little lamp but i have it pointed like facing away so like facing that way like up towards the opposite direction that i am so it just provides like a little bit of light um and then the light from my monitors that's the only light um yeah so it's i mean and then obviously there's some light coming from the hallway so you can see my my door there there's there's some light okay philip says there's also a plan to turn it into a desktop app with electron but i'm not sure if it can access the file system since i would like to also block websites with it i don't know does anyone know that i'm not i mean it's definitely possible to turn this into an electron app um but i haven't worked with electron that much to know very you know very much about it john says uh hopefully material design or any uh styling set out there is not copyright protected yeah as far as i know material design like you can use material design um in in your projects uh i i think google actually prefers that you use it um for android apps especially um so there's no there's no copyright in the sense that you can't actually use material design principles let's see uh neuro asks um what my youtube profile is if you check in the description to this video i do have a link to my youtube channel i think it's the channel id is like jessie r weigel i i think um but anyway it's in the description for for this video so um yeah if you want my i don't update my channel nearly as much as i upload videos here um to uh free code but i have a lot of ideas for videos that i want to do i just i know i've been saying for like being saying for like six months that i'm gonna add videos and i haven't really added that many um but i would like to okay all right so still have a lot left in the live chat i'm going to write down where i'm leaving off at and i will come back to that spot and keep answering questions after our next coding session here okay all right so if i didn't get to your question yet uh please be patient i will get to your question after we do this next um next coding session okay um so let's look at what are we at okay uh jordan and q tube just join and are wondering what's what's going on uh so for right now we're just trying to get these three buttons aligned properly but our other goal our main goal is to try to get some more content on this page just to get an idea of what the layout's going to look like this is the home page of our react site that we're building with next js all right all right let's um let's just auto layout oh this kind of looks like what i want i guess i could make two different containers i don't think i really need to though all right so how did they do this it's just small six i don't know maybe that won't work all right what was i let's get rid of this for a second so okay so here's a great container we could we had a bunch of suggestions for this i want to try to go through suggestions um basically whatever the easiest one to implement is i want to try that first and then move on to some of the the harder ones so i think i remember seeing one that would have been pretty easy oh maybe johnson i don't know if john was saying to make it row or that just stick with the default as being row which yeah it shouldn't change anything the default is row right i thought it was so the creative or flexi right here is to send your content okay so yeah row is the default so i'm going to go ahead and remove that uh just because it's unnecessary we need i'm really wondering if we should have just went with see this honestly would have been easier if i just did all the css myself because now i'm just trying to figure out how to do it within the the grid system that comes with mature ui all right let me see why so i have devtools open on my other screen here i'm trying to figure out why the width is what it is for this button okay so i guess it's just based on the um the label size let's test that out yeah okay so it's it is just based on the the text that we have in there okay that makes sense uh in this case i don't want that to be the case though so let's try let's try just setting up so i i kind of think the surest way that we're going to get this to look right is to kind of set all this in um you know just like absolute units and just make sure that it's narrow enough that it'll work on any device and then we should be should be all right i mean normally like you don't want to hard code with like saying like okay this is going to be 200 pixels because if somebody looks at your site on a phone it'll it'll bleed over to the edge right um but if you make it so that the pixels are definitely small i think the smallest phone uh in terms of screen width is like 320 pixels so as long as you're below that then you should be all right and we we certainly don't need that much so let's take a look at how many pixels these buttons are taking up right now so i'm not going to bring devtools over 56 okay so this one is 56 so if we go with this being which i i like this size so let's go with 56 so we're looking at 112. look at 112 pixels but we do want to space it we want at least 8 pixel space in between these um so that actually that works out fine so this button we're going to make it um 120 pixels wide and then we'll work on on these here to get them to come in and be right underneath here so first things first let's check out our button our button here nice and raised let me show you another way to do css in react so if you wanted to just add something to one element you're not going to reuse that class you might want to think about doing it like this okay so i'm i mean everybody has their own preferences for ways to do it but in this case um i kind of like to do it this way instead of making a whole another class so what we're going to do is say style and we're going to how do we do this was it two i think it's two brackets uh and then we'll say i'm pretty sure it's two racks well we'll find out um they were going to say with yeah it is two brackets right because the first set of brackets is telling is saying hey we're going to do some javascript the second set is an object right and so we want this to be an object so we're going to say with and then we're going to say 120 pixels right on that button and let's see if it works it looks wider let's double check and the width is 120 pixels that really doesn't look like it's going to be wide enough though let me see oh you know what i looked at the wrong size it was 88 pixels the total button size i was just looking at the size of the text alright so we got 88 pixels okay so we'll have to make our button a little bit bigger then um 60 176 176 plus eight um what we got 184 i think 184 all right so we'll try that so um 88 and 88 and then plus 8 pixels for space in between i'm pretty sure you give this 184 all right so now let's try to move this in i can just do it in dev tools for now um i suppose so we have a line items center going on here um but we don't want that why do we even have that doesn't make any sense um let's see where this button is going so textile so all right so all right so we can add a justify content um let's see there we go that's better flex and flick store all right so if we add next all right oh let me check out um okay uh john that's what i was messing with in um uh in devtools so and what is harshit is saying p o p r okay p r is up okay um all right we'll see what's what's going on with our shit's pr in a second uh just to show how we could do it uh potentially we could go on this grid item and say oops styles let's just copy this we could add a style into each one of these whoa um and the style could be justify content and then we could do a flex end and then on on this one we could do a flex start and this should align things let's see okay see and then we have things line up you know like we wanted it and now probably this is going to look yeah all right so i think somebody mentioned it's going to look weird on mobile so we would definitely have to add in you know at some point we would need to have a media query uh to fix that or actually potentially we wouldn't right we could just do um we could just change this so that it's it's six all the way let's see if that fixes it yeah that actually fixes it we could go six all the way it looks like this button needs to be a bit wider though um so maybe my mat oh you know what i think my math was right and we just have a larger gap in between here uh than than i was thinking so i actually like that gap i like that size so i'm just going to go ahead and keep that but then adjust the um let's see what do we have here for padding okay so this is 16 pixels so if i just add 8 pixels onto this button it should work um two there we go that doesn't look centered though does it look centered to you something looks off maybe it's just because the dogs i don't know anyway let me check this um okay so harshit has made a pull request too so i guess let's check that out and also there was um i think christian mentioned in a uh in open an issue saying we should update to the latest version of material ui so we'll have to do that i'm not going to do it on the stream today but anyway if christians watching i just want to let you know i i did read that that issue and i will update that soon okay cool uh so check out harshit's uh alternative way of doing it here so this is our same so we've we've he's added this flex row um class that just says display flex and then also added margin you know and margin a pixels so we've added the class name flex row to a div and then just threw the buttons in there and then just added that margin of eight pixels for each one okay cool and actually make sure flex hard i'm i'm wondering though let's see oh okay all right i just saw your message yeah because when i read this i'm wondering that these would align them all center right but it wouldn't it wouldn't be like have the side by side stuff so anyway um uh thanks harshit um i guess we could we kind of stumbled on a solution though here so for now uh this is going to be okay um just to give my boss an idea what it would look like if we had three buttons i don't know why i just i just keep looking at this and it it seems like no it looks better on a smaller screen maybe it does have maybe it is centered all right cool so we've got that part finished um let's let's at least add in some things um john's saying it's an optical uh illusion uh it is centered that's what i was thinking i i i'm kind of thinking on a big screen because the dog's um face is not completely centered and it's more obvious on a large screen that it somehow throws this off for me you know when you get smaller like here it looks fine to me but the dog's face is also centered anyway i'm gonna trust that it's centered uh all right let's check out this card all right we're gonna get rid of this card media let's see yeah yeah i'm gonna get rid of the media and okay good that's that's what it should be doing and let's check out the cards because i want to make a card title so i just want to make see what the title is okay let's see what they do for title oh they just use typography headline okay that works i actually like it that way um they put it in actions or content okay card content yeah why is this in actions this should be in content and let's say this is events and let's see how it looks first whoa oh card content is not defined we have this we'll probably use card actions at some point so i'm gonna leave it in there uh we in fact we are using it for the other card right now okay cool and what we'll need is let's grab some uh grab some images let's let's go to unsplash i'll just grab a random image okay it's just random i just wanted to double check what the url was um we'll need you know what there's probably a component for this what we want is a list grid list that we want actually this grid list looks a lot like what we're trying to do like these gridless tiles i might have to think about that uh trying to adapt that to use it for a whole layout but that's not what we want right now let's just check out a regular list so i want a list that includes an image there we go this is what i want let's make sure yeah all right so minus the checkbox i want the image and this and then maybe we'll add a description as well okay all right let me throw in within this card there we go in here uh we're gonna put the list in there all right i'm just gonna throw this in here so i don't lose it right now and we're gonna need to bring in we're going to import a list let's import the list item list on the secondary action actions we don't need the secondary action we do need that and we need avatar okay now we can just pull in their example stuff first and then modify it and i think my timer just ran out so as soon as i finish this i'll get to back to the live chat all right so let's take this and let's put it as the source and let's make this square and um what do we want list item text we want for now let's just say event one will completely take out all this checkbox stuff and now all right let's throw it we'll throw it in a couple of times and list item three and we have classes list item so we'll need to get that and add it in as well so where's our list item root oh no are we pulling that in from somewhere else hmm let's see are we bringing in styles all right maybe that'll work value is not defined oops i think i left in some uh some of these values for the key value where's value still used oops uhoh three four all right let's save that and see what we have now what did i do all right well let's take out oh sh all right let's actually take out typography as well we don't need that i thought i took out austria completely i put them in the wrong spot okay well this makes more sense so all right all right now let's see what happened hey there we go all right okay so this is about what we were looking for um so we'll have events and i don't know if i'm going to keep it like this circle this obviously works if it was really an avatar it looks fine but potentially we might want you know square images or something for events i don't even know if we want images at all for events really but this would just be something you know to look at as a placeholder all right not bad not as much as i had hoped to get done uh these buttons took way longer than i thought they would uh but at least i had something so we may end up working on this again tomorrow uh we'll see this is our main project now although we do have some other things that need done all right let me go back to live chat and um i'm gonna scroll up let's see 2 17. all right so from here on out i'm not going to do coding i'm going to check out all the questions on the live chat and try to answer as many as i can when i get through everything in the live chat then we will end the stream okay so soft so ss0ph says uh did you learn javascript entirely on free code camp uh no not entirely on free code camp so i um where did i start uh probably it was a mixture of free code camp and udacity a lot of udacity free courses and just i guess i did codecademy too those are like the main resources like for more formal resources online and then a lot of it was just working on projects and looking up how to do things so a lot of trial and error uh john hanson saying random math that will auto play a mix of images for those cards oh maybe that was when i was explaining what this was gonna do um yeah we may do something like that irish it says the dark theme looks awesome i should have made that dark from the beginning yeah the dark it does look cool i started to make obviously for the university we have light you know for all things but for my like side projects i started doing a lot more with with dark themes uh so it is i think it it looks nice let's see nur is asking about what about react uh do you know it very well um i don't i don't know i mean i i know it i've built you know i built things that work with it uh things that are fast um that that look pretty good uh so i know enough to do that i i wouldn't say i'm an expert at react uh but i am proficient i'd say would you would you all say that's a adequate explanation that i'm proficient and react i don't know maybe i'm being too generous with myself there so uh philip asks if i have to specify all the sizes for it to work i'm assuming philip you were talking about these sizes for the grid you know what i don't know i i thought i tried it before and i do have to specify the sizes but i'm not 100 sure i wonder let's just try to take these out and see okay it looks good let's take these out too oh yeah it still works cool let's see can we take let me take this out oops so far so good yeah actually i am only using the one here so yeah it should be fine right cool yeah so um i'm not sure if that was your question but if it was the answer is no you don't need to define everything i think as long as you define the extra small it'll just by default you know use it for the other sizes that's what it seems like so at least for now it seems like everything's working and and that's how it would work so i guess it does make sense to not use them all you could save a little bit of typing philip says do you prefer css or the react css in the file um philip it kind of depends on what i'm doing so in this file i i really don't mind uh so what we're doing it we're trying to use a lot of the components that come with material ui and this is the way that all the examples for material ui do things so it actually is easier and it makes more sense to just stick with that way of doing things so i like this way obviously i like to combine something like this with some inline styles where appropriate so for instance this width i think it makes sense to make this with inline since we only use it once on one component it ends up using you using up less lines uh we actually don't even add a line at all uh than if we were to create a whole other class just to use it once so i like that uh some people don't like anything inline at all but i don't see a problem with it when used like that but then you know on something like our our faculty.js page where we actually weren't we didn't have a lot of components here but we were importing all this other html and we needed to style that then i really liked using the regular css you know and just bringing it in so how are we importing that i don't remember how we brought that in now oh we brought it we imported it like this uh so i prefer that uh because really i have to go to the page check it out in dev tools do the changes i can come back and do it in the css file i don't have access directly to that that markup from within my component so doing it like this makes a lot more sense is this how i have to do it no i don't have to do it like that but um for me it just it it makes more sense to do it like this than to have it in here you know like i don't want to have a bunch of you know css classes here for things that you can't even really see in the component you know we're just bringing this in um it to me i think it makes this component more reusable it's obvious right that we are bringing in some styles here but really at any point we could change this and make it a prop and then we could potentially reuse this now i know this is a page and it's in a page in in next but if we really wanted to you know in let's say in a somewhat different situation this entire thing could be reusable we just pop in a different um css file so it would make sense to me you know so anyway it just kind of depends all right uh what's this uh naren says the mobile version of the website downgrades the user experience a lot the hover property and the background attachment fixed are no longer displayed any substitutions for that um are you talking about this site i'm not that was um noreen asked that so and maybe like just in general um so on the mobile i think background attachment fix actually does work on android um at least last time i tried i was pretty sure it worked but you're right so on ios mobile safari it does not work um as well as the hover so uh which you still can get is like a tap effect so right now like the hover here let's see if i have it okay so you see that effect that just happens when i click it you can still have that happen on touch so you'll get obviously you're not going to have a hover on on a touch screen right but you can still get some effect on the button that ripple and then with the background thing you could do two things one you could just make it so that your background attachment is not fixed you switch it over with a media query to something like maybe static and then you just don't get that parallax effect anymore at works it's it's okay or if you wanted to keep the parallax effect you could switch over and use some javascript to give you that same parallax effect okay a little bit heavier but you get the same user experience on a mobile device and a desktop so i guess it just depends on on you know what you want to do for a site let's say that maybe is not going to get a lot of mobile use maybe you don't want to worry about it but for a site that's going to be you have a lot of mobile users you may want to think about one with the javascript you know parallax scrolling effect uh philip asks if the timer gave a notification sound i don't remember hearing a notification sound um so i don't know i wasn't really paying attention though i saw a notification pop up on my screen but i didn't hear the sound but it i mean i'm listening to music too so depending on what the sound was it could have happened and i just wasn't paying attention didn't hear it over the music okay rook says i'm gonna mess around with the fork of this project uh awesome rook um you're you're welcome to make a pull request if you want or if you take it in another direction and do some cool stuff with it um let me know i'd love to check it out youtube says that dog is adorable yeah it is i love this stuff my um my wife's parents have a dog that looks just like this it's actually it looks like it's it's um fatter than this one but uh but anyway they have a dog like this and uh her name is lilo but it always reminds me of her you know i like the dog it is so cute it's distractingly cute says i wish i was that doggo noreen says the dog is smelling the button yeah it does look like that phillip says can we get a dog instead of jesse nothing personal just i might actually get more viewers if i just had a dog sitting here and you could see the dog i could still do the voice over and do the coding but if you just saw a video of a dog instead of my face that might be a better viewing experience i don't know if i could bring a dog into work though i have to see if i if i ever get better internet at my house maybe i'll borrow someone's dog and we'll try it out uh purville says i've just joined what's this project about um today we were just working with aligning some buttons and creating this card that displays events but the project in general is going to be the main website for the university that i work for that's franciscan university of steubenville we're building it with react specifically we're using next.js mainly for the serverside rendering that it offers and we're migrating a lot of data from another database into a wordpress mysql database and then we're going to pull that data with graphql into our react application if you want to know more about the project go back and watch some of the previous videos especially the first few videos for project five and you'll get a much more thorough explanation of what we're trying to do here uh q tube asks what does typography do so type let's see i have it somewhere here oops let's go over to index so q tube is asking about the typography uh element here so when you're using material ui the the beta version they have this element called typography and you can give it a type and depending on the type anything in here will display differently so a subheading will display a certain way you could do different kinds of headings right like h1 h2 you could do regular body text like paragraph text so you know you can check out the uh the documentation for material ui beta on typography and see all the options that are available but basically anywhere where you want text to display you could just do typography and then add a type and that's how you would display your text so you're you're almost never going to see just a paragraph tag or an h tag you know just hanging out here when you're using uh material ui beta version you certainly could put it in there but material ui you know has you covered with this typography component i'm sorry not a component but i guess it is it is a component um we just never work directly with with it as a component here but uh but it is i i don't know why i was calling it something else but you import it from yeah from material ui rook says is that a dinner bell i hear it sorry i'm hungry what was it oh yeah it was so it it's not a dinner bell but pretty close like right across the hallway from my office there's a bell on the wall and there's like a little room uh like a little prayer room and uh at three o'clock pretty much every day at three o'clock they ring the bell and then people go in there and and they pray um you know for everybody in the office and whatever else they want to pray for um so but i usually do my streams during that time so if you do hear a bell around it's 3 p.m my time eastern time that's what it is okay philip says by the way one thing to always remember if you're working with a wordpress site if you move it from live to local environment remember to change database settings or you might nuke half of your live site yeah i've moved a lot of wordpress sites over the years so um it's always good to have the reminder though um but yeah you got to be careful when you're moving it doesn't always work out how you think it would work out moving wordpress sites is is always it seems more complicated than than you would would want it to be than it should be but um and i don't do it often enough to remember exactly how i did it every time so i always have to look up the instructions for how to properly move it but we'll probably move it on a stream or something so that might be a cool stream to do uh jordan asks if this is on github it is it is on github uh the repo i think is called let's see do i have the repo up i thought i did yeah the repos called franciscan react and actually i should um i'll push the changes up now did i never push changes from this faculty.css i guess not wow sorry to anyone who uh was trying to look at this i guess i forgot to put changes push changes from weeks ago um uh all right so i'm going to commit that and then i'll push it list is defined but never used import list wait did i mess this up ah i did all right let's wrap this in a list i mean it still worked but we'll try to do this the proper way make sure it still looks alright where's the page at okay cool uh still works now it's going to run a bunch of checks it's going to do the tests it's going to do some formatting some auto formatting in the code if it passes everything obviously linting as well but if it passes everything then we'll have a successful commit awesome and it says i should update npm uh now we can go get push origin since we're on the master branch no i did turn my computer off when i wasn't here over over the break i need to put this in again so all right okay so now uh our gate repo should be updated if i could find it so many windows open there it is all right cool um so we did have so we do have everything updated at this point okay uh i iboto i think that's how you pronounce it says is asking about the theme in visual studio code hardship said it is the seti theme uh i better wanted to know what exactly the name was um preferences you where do i go i don't even know where i go to change the maybe setting oh you know what i just found it no color theme yeah actually it's just seti scti that's the name of the the theme as jordan said the repo has not been updated in two weeks yeah that was my fault we had done work on the stream and i just forgot to push the changes uh up to the the repo do we have any other we did have some other branches too but right now the one actively being worked on is the master branch sergio says ask do you recommend udacity frontend certification i've done a lot of the udacity courses for that frontend certification the free versions of them so some courses on udacity you have to pay to get any access to at all other ones you can go through the course for free you just won't get your projects uh reviewed by anybody at udacity so the review is valuable so if you have the money and the time i think it it is really valuable to do the product the paid version of the projects i don't know if the certification helps that much you know to let's say put that on a resume i don't really know uh maybe for companies that have hired people from udacity and are you know happy with those those people the work that they do maybe it'll mean something to them but i don't know that udacity is well known enough that it'll like guarantee you a job but the when you turn in a project for udacity you're doing the paid version and you get the feedback from someone that's really really valuable it'll push you to make better projects so like i said if you have the time and the money i do recommend it but don't feel like you have to you can certainly still get you know a lot of the knowledge from the free version of the course and then if you ever get a time where you do have some more time or more money then you can do the paid version and you already are ahead of the game because you've you've gone through a lot of it but yeah i would for sure check out the free version of the courses think about doing the paid version i'm not affiliated with udacity in any way so that's just my honest opinion so i have done the free and the paid version of some of the courses and i think there's good content on udacity uh z work says why does free code camp seem to focus on front end development why we why don't they cover the back end uh they actually do have backend lessons it just comes later on so if you look at you know the free code camp website um we'll check it out right now uh let's see no i want the map here we go so you can see i only have 285 points uh but you know all this stuff at the beginning is front end uh but you get here there's a data visualization certification then we have the back end so there's a whole section that's for the back end it's just you know a lot of people if they're trying to go in order a lot of people don't get to that point it takes a lot of work to get there you know for me i started going through free code camp and then i just i got too much paid work and i started doing that and just kind of didn't get around to you know to finishing it i'd love to finish it one day uh just not not right now i'll probably wait until the new curriculum comes out to do anything more with it uh but we we do in fact have uh back end a backend certification and we have a lot of backend uh projects uh catholic says does anyone know a good auto format package for visual studio code for react rook says uh prettier plus eslint um catholic says thanks had to stop using it because of the formatting hopefully that fixes it um okay yeah that i i use the prettier eslint setup as well uh teo says uh are you doing this with bootstrap no not bootstrap uh we're using material ui uh the beta version of material ui so it's a react um it basically it does what bootstrap does for for regular html sites it does that for react and it uses the material design style oh mayor says i did a pull request please check cool let's just check this out button layouts all right cool thanks mayor i'll have to check this out let's see says jesse we need to code we did uh if you're joining us later on uh we finished the coding portion so normally if you join me in a live chat for like the first hour or so that's when we do the majority of the coding and then the last part of the live stream is when i answer the questions so you can check out the code portion of it on the recording in this video and if you don't want us hang around for the questions and all the talking just skip that part of the video um so actually that's good i i know um i've i've had people before say they like the code part not so much the talking part so maybe in that case the live stream isn't really the best thing for you if you wait and watch the recording you could watch it um you could either skip the talking all together or just play it on a fast speed and then slow it down when the code part comes so that i think that's a great way to do it if you don't have a lot of time or if you're just you know really want to you know see the coding uh you know skip to like some part that's interesting for you so um so anyway for anybody that is in that situation you know give that a try i love to have you all for the live chat but i totally understand if it's uh if it's too time consuming or if i'm just too boring to listen to i i get that too all right rook says that that pr from mayor is great cool i'll have to i'll have to check out how this looks after the stream two is too much says what is your project uh it's a react project it's gonna be the main website for franciscan university of steubenville so just really quickly we're using react we're going to do serverside rendering we're pulling the data from a wordpress um uh wordpress installation that's using graphql so we're gonna get the data out of that and display it with react all right and that's it i'm to the end of the live chat so uh thank you all for for watching and if you ask a question and i i skipped over it that was definitely accidental so um you go and send me a question on twitter if you want or uh put it as a comment to this video or just wait till the next live stream and ask ask the question be happy to ask um uh i'll be happy to help you all out with anything i can i should be back what is today today's wednesday wow okay so i should be able to stream tomorrow around the same time so somewhere around maybe one or two p.m eastern time um so until then thanks again for watching and have a great day
